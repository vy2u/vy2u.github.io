Halloween makeup tutorial today we're
doing a creepy clown but she's glam and
she has a crown on so she's a queen and
then also we do a little nod to a carved
pumpkin with the mouth so it's just a
whole bunch of random things making this
clown look and I really really enjoyed
it for those of you who follow me on
snapchat know that I did a killer clown
look before I just wasn't feeling it so
I didn't upload it because I want
nothing but the best for you so it came
up with this one and I like this one so
much better see ever that need further
ado if you would like to know I had to
get this creepy glam killer clown makeup
look for Halloween then keep on watching
alright so the first product I'm gonna
go in with is my makeup forever this is
their Ultra HD foundation stick and they
came out with a white one which is
perfect for this look today so when we
think of clowns we think of white bases
and when we think of creepy clowns we
think of washed out wide basis so that
is exactly what we're gonna do I'm gonna
take the stick and literally just go
everywhere don't be neat or anything
with it just just slap it on and then
with a brush we're gonna sloppily blend
it all in and you want it to be streaky
patchy and even everything you don't
want a normal foundation to be on a day
to day basis today is what you want that
to be an even catchy a mess go with the
flow so I'm just swirling the white into
my face and see all the streaks so what
you want baby
oh that's streakiness all that
patchiness all that unevenness we're
living for that today
uh-huh all right now I'm going to go
into a white eyeshadow to sporadically
set this because when we hug people I
want my face to stay with me and not
land a thumb with shoulder so I'm going
to go in with sugar pills taco eye
shadow and a morphe g40 brush and I'm
just going to take that powder and set
it sporadically no rhyme or reason and
this will make it look patchy in and
even as well now I'm going to contour my
face using this makeup geek eyeshadow in
bedrock and this brush by Anasazi
Beverly Hills the a23 brush and we want
to make our faces look sunken in and as
if we we've had it with walking down the
streets looking like a creepy glam clown
we're over it we've done this for too
long it's been a decade we're over it
I'm going to take that color and with
this I'm just going to darken the
cheekbone and again this doesn't have to
be neat or beautifully blended at all we
just want that that feel of sunken in
deadness and then I'm also going to go
down here to get that really skeleton I
mean I'm Way too too full to look like a
skeleton but you know what I'm saying to
get that really like skeleton like
contour you can always go back in with
that white and soften it you know that
that little bit of wanting to make it
perfect is still in me and then let's
not forget about the temples yes
okay now I'm hopping over to the makeup
forever flash palette and going into the
white and with this we're going to map
out that classic clown eyes shape
creepy but fun
we're also going to fill that in but
again this doesn't have to be perfectly
applied and colored in at all we just
want to fill it up and make it look like
a hot damn mess
and I'm going to be setting that using
that same sugar pill shadow
and you want to be quite like intense
when setting it because it will disrupt
the base and make it even more messy all
right now I'm going to go in with cherry
cola by makeup geek as well and a
Cosette
number five brush and we're going to
hollow out the lower lash line
and make it look really disrupted and
sickly and and just she's over it when
you also kind of want to smear that out
sloppily as well and the right here you
want to make it the deepest so we're
really giving that a few so I'm going to
go in with Americano to deepen it even
more you can always go in with that
white make it streaky in and again
see how it's a little bit too made-up
and like makeup like so that's when you
go in with that white to make it feel
like it's blended into that skin and
torn and like a blah and what let's also
pop some of the cherry cola right here
on the inner corner and same technique
kinda whisking and like smudging it out
to give it a really grungy look now with
black water activated face paint I'm
going to create a line around the white
and also as the little you know they
always have like the creepy little it's
creepy and again for me it doesn't have
to be neat or perfectly applied at all
because we're scary we're not like oh my
god clown your lines are a mess no we
run away in fear and now for the creepy
little thing they always have right in
between
now we're doing the same on the bottom
now I'm going to go into my skin
illustrator American Horror Story
alcohol activated paint palette and I'm
going to go in with this yellowy orange
e color right here and this pink and I'm
going to create this sickly veining vibe
around the white of my face so for this
I take a texturized sponge and I
activate the paint using 99% alcohol and
with this I'm just going to stipple it
onto the face to make it look veiny and
disgusting then of course if you feel
like you did too much you can always go
back in with that white from the
beginning go over top and make it look
as if it's underneath and in your skin
even more for the mouth I want a little
nod to a carved pumpkin mouth but in
black so I'm going to make it all jagged
and crazy and smiley and torn up with
black water activated face paint
now of course to seal the deal on this
clown and to make it look more like a
clown we're going to do a red dot on the
nose using water activated paint
there we go now what I'm going to do is
pop in some contacts apply my wig and
then this clown should be done for
Halloween and that guys concludes this
creepy glam clown with the crown creepy
glam clown queen I don't know
cons are just the thing to be this
Halloween with all the crazy killer
comes around us so yeah that's it I hope
