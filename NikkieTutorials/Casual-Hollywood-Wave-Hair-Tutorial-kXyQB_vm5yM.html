tutorial and it's been like probably
almost a Hughton uh not a year ago I
actually love playing with my hair and
do my hair and did all these types of I
love doing my ear and all these kind of
different hair styles but I never do
tutorials on them while I do get a lot
of requests for them so today I'm going
to do this is a really nice casual but
really glamorous hairdo and if you want
to know how I did this then please keep
on watching so the first thing you want
to do is take a shower and wash your
hair what I'm going to do now is apply a
oil treatment to the ends of my hair
because my hair tends to get really dry
at the ends you know because of using
the curling irons and all the flat irons
and the oil I use is Moroccan oil
treatment for every hair type there is
okay I'm not going to take a tangle
teezer and just brush out my hair and
just get rid of all the nob and just get
rid of all the stupid things that are in
there okay then I'm going to brush
everything to the back so you can make
your party now you're going to take a
comb like this and just make your
parting for me I'm going to make my
parting on my right side because I think
that's more flattering for me I'm just
going to go to like the beginning of the
highest point of my eyebrow I'm just
going to place it there and just trace
it back then comb to the right so you
get your parting and then comb one part
to the side it should be on and then the
rest to the other side okay once you've
done all that you're going to prep your
hair and prepping the hair kind of means
putting products in it to make the curl
last longer a little trick that a lot of
people backstage at the shows or shoots
use is um they use hairspray right
before they put the curling iron on it
or the flat iron um I'm not going to do
that today because I know that YouTube
is gonna be like what the hell are you
doing
- your hair woman I'm going to use a BB
thickening spray by Bumble and Bumble
swear by this stuff we all use the
backstage at Mooney offs we all use a
backstage at the shows we love this
stuff so what I'm going to do is just
spritz this all over my hair it I just
kind of massage your hair and get the
product everywhere and just kind of
brush it through
so just blow-dry your hair now and make
sure that everything is dry you don't
want any damp places because if you curl
them it's gonna it's not gonna be good
okay so chair is completely dry it's
time to curl but before we do that we're
going to protect the hair a little bit
more what I'm going to use is Qi
forty-four iron guard this is a he
protecting spray and I'm just going to
take my first section of hair that I'm
gonna curl and then I sprayed some 44
iron guard into my hand and put it on my
ends okay and then the curling iron I'm
going to use is this one by Chi now Chi
is well known like really really well
known for their flat irons and their
flat irons are the bomb I love them but
the curling irons are like my children
EBU and Bella so I'm going to use the
biggest one and I'm going to use the
biggest one to create more of the like
natural wave the smaller your curling
iron is the more unnatural it's gotta
look basically put it on and then put it
on 185 but I'm basically going to do is
I'm going to curl this section away from
my face I'm just going to take a strand
by going down and taking a party take a
curling iron and face it down vertical
and wrap your hair around it wrap it
around it and then hold it like that
and you can always move a bit to get the
heat throughout the hair faster that's
what I normally do I just kind of move
it back and forth and then hold it and
then just let it fall off and then
you're going to wave like that okay you
just toss that to the back forget about
it and do the rest wrapping around it
away from the face going back and forth
a bit to get the heat faster throughout
the hair and then hold hold hold hold
people yeah once you got that side
curled you're going to take a hair spray
and just spray it spray it forget about
it and not do the other side is exactly
the same going vertically down and
you're going to curl that section
all around it hello pan down a bit now
let it fall off and I'll just take your
middle section and your middle section
is like not the top just like in between
so I'm just going to let this go
and then just kind of take out the very
top okay don't forget put heat
protectant spray on that section as well
and basically for this section it's
exactly the same and then just start
doing the same routine as we did on the
bottom it's easy peasy for now okay so
not for the top just bring it back into
your parting instead of just holding
your curling iron vertical and then just
doing the same as to the other side so
lift that piece up grab my curling iron
and curl it like this go down and then
just let it go and what this does it
creates the curl and it still goes
backwards away from your face but it
gives you a little lift at the like
roots of your hair now for this very
very front part of the hair I'm just
going to take a section and instead of
doing the curl that we used to do take
your curling iron do this motion clamp
it down and then curl like you would
normally curl away from the face so once
I got that side done I'm going to take
my favorite hairspray which is cheap and
viral flex hold hairspray and I'm just
going to spray the entire side now we're
going to do this crazy side right here
all we're going to do is use the same
curling iron but curl inwards and just
do the same just curl inwards now let's
say you want a little bit more of hair
going inwards you're just going to take
one strand of hair brush it out
and curl that inwards as well so it's
not just that piece going inwards but
just a little bit more hair than that
what I'm not going to do is let this
rest let the hairspray settle in let it
all cool down and really give it some
time to rest and I'm going to do
something that most of you will probably
not like but I'm going to brush this out
and what it will do when you brush out
curls is give it that really nice
elegant like glamorous Hollywood feeling
I love it so I'm just gonna brush it out
look ah love that and all I'm going to
do now is take my enviro flex hold
hairspray from chi and um hairspray it
all for shine for hold for Hollywood
just do it so yeah this is how I like to
do this modern vintage hair with a twist
or something I don't know yet how I'm
going to call it but I like this it is
nice and wearable it is nice and
glamorous so if you want a fullness of
