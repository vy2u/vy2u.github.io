on the look I was wearing in my March
hits and oh god knows you guys mom
barred me with requests for that look so
today I am here doing it for you is a
very monotone earthy brown toned makeup
look with this super intense cat
eyeliner and just the lips and just the
everything it's super glam yet still
edgy and different and monotone so
monotone cat eyes see it without any
further ado if you want to know how to
get this look right here then keep on
watching so I already went ahead and did
my base foundation so I used my
foundation concealer did brows all that
it's now time to do the first thing for
the eyes I'm first putting down a base
I'm taking my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot
and this will prevent everything from
creasing now I'm just taking a
light-colored matte eyeshadow and with a
big fluffy blending brush this is going
all over and this will help make
blending easier
the first eyeshadow I'll be using is a
fun by unsavoury Valley Hills no no what
are you doing and really simply I'm
defining my crease with this and you can
go for a winged eye shape on the outer
edge you can go round it I'm just
following the natural curves I'm hugging
the natural curves of my crease
then with a big fluffy blending brush
and still using fun I'm just blending
that out even more making it look
seamless for the lower lash line I'm
again taking fawn and what people seem
to love so much is that the lower lash
line was very smoky and vampy and dark
so go ahead and blend this as far down
as you like now going in anasazi Beverly
Hills this smoke eyeshadow and just
deepening that outer corner for the
little bit using makeup gigs foiled
eyeshadow in grandstand and first
applying the majority of it with my
finger I feel like I get most coverage
using my fingers and then perfecting
with a brush now it's time for the key
feature of this look the cat eye liner
so I'm first going in with my cavity
tattoo liner in trooper just to make my
outline and I'll fill in easing my NYC
black liquid liner just because I love
sort of mapping out the shape with
Kathleen dee and I like the madness and
the opaqueness of the NYC one and that
is why I use that to fill it in then
from that line you want to drag it back
on to your lid as close to the inner
corner as you can then what I like to do
next is focus on that cat flick so I
just place the cavity tattoo liner in my
like in my tear duct area like directly
into my eye drag it out and that creates
a line and from there you can finish the
whole thing off from here you can drag
this side back into the eye and from
here you connect it to the eyeliner
so once you've got the outline all you
want to do is fill in between the lines
okay from there to give the crease a
little bit more of a cut feel like a cup
crease I'm taking Anasazi Beverly Hills
smoke again and because I want to warm
the shade a little bit up because I feel
like it's a little bit too ashy for the
look I'm mixing it with a little bit of
caramel and then that shade is going
right into the crease from that wing you
want to bring it into the crease all the
way to the inner corner like a cut
crease blend it out softly that way you
give your crease a little bit more
definition and define meant without
actually cutting your crease once you've
got that you're done all you want to do
now is the PI mascara and just some
false lashes today I'll be using wheels
these are the pixie luxe by house of
lashes but first mascara
all right on to cheeks the first thing
I'll be doing is giving myself a lovely
contour using lms cos eyeshadow in
heroine
then to bronze up my skin and taking
this mineralized skinfinish by Mac
called to give me Sun and just from the
contour both that in to your cheeks far
blush luminous though by Milani my
highlighter I'm of course using Becca
shimmering skin Perfector pressed in
moonstone and the glow goes right here
on the highest parts of your cheekbones
blending down unto the the ball in that
little dent of the nose right here
Cupid's bow chin and just a tiny dot on
the tip of your nose to make it look
more uplifted and slim and just amazing
and cute that's it for the cheeks for
lips the first products I'll be using is
a stone lip pencil by Mac
then to fill that and I'm taking
coloured raine liquid lipstick in
marshmallow
and taking the tiniest bit of coloured
raine liquid lipstick insole just to
deepen it a tiny bit and that guy's
concludes this monotone cat eyes look I
