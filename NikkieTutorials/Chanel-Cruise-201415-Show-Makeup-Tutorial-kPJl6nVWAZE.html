tutorial on Chanel's cruise collection
for 2014-15 the models were this amazing
black smokey eye with double wing and
then they had gold leaf on their inner
corners and as soon as I saw the look I
was like mm hmm hmm hmm see I was just
in the mood for something a little bit
more extreme today I know you're not
going grocery shopping with this or
whatever but it's great for like a party
or if you have like an I should know
inspired party you can rock this you can
be like I'm couse 2014-15 baby so yeah
without any further ado if you want to
know how to get this Chanel look which I
really like this then please keep on
watching all right so the first thing
I'll be doing is prepping my face and
putting sort of a moisturizer slash
primer on and I'll be using a sample
size of the Chanel leblanc illuminating
sheer base something and I'll just be
rubbing that into my face definitely
still think this is a very unique and
rare texture because it's thick and it
feels very moisturizing but on the other
hand it doesn't it's unique I don't have
words for it since this is a Chanel
inspired look I am gonna try to grab as
many Chanel products as I can throughout
this entire video so for a foundation
I'll be using my Chanel vital in your
aqua foundation in number 10 beige but
because I want that to have a little bit
more coverage I am gonna mix some Mac
select cover-up into the mix and apply
to the face and I'm buffing this in
using my makeup geek foundation
stippling brush I still love it like no
out there alright I'm actually really
impressed by that it is goe
healthy-looking and it still looks like
skin it hasn't lost that skin texture I
absolutely love this finish I'm gonna
wear this way more often now now it's
time for concealer and of course I'll be
using my Mac Pro Longwear in NC
fifteen and that's about it that I'm
using today I'm not gonna highlight
anything crazy I'm just gonna highlight
under my eyes and I'll be blending this
in with my favorite Sigma tapered kabuki
brush in f-86 and I'm just stippling
that in I again want to thank Jaclyn
hill for this amazing recommendation
because it works like heaven okay and
once I've got that all I'm gonna powder
my face using my Chanel Mitchell is
finished powder in Clair 20 my favorite
powder ever and I'm quickly gonna do
brows and one eye off-camera I am gonna
try to keep my brows a little bit more
natural I'm probably gonna fail at it
but no the thought is there so that's
what comes see how I'll be doing that
all off-camera and then I'll be back to
prime my eyes I'll be starting off with
my soft ochre Paint Pot from Mac now
taking these Saucebox a toothed pellet
and I'll be using the black called
toffee and almond the sort of Grey's
taupe color and I'm gonna start off by
tracing my crease and you really want to
look straight forward into a mirror and
map it out you don't want to go too high
you don't want to go too low you just
want it to be that if you look straight
forward it has a little bit of a black
line there I'm also gonna connect that
to very very inner corner so when I look
straight into the camera you can just
see that line peeking through and that
is what you want then with the black
only I'm gonna make my shape on the
outer part and that is just starting off
with a winged liner flicking it out
slowly and then once you have that from
there you want to go back into your
crease and meet up with that first line
and now gradually you want to build this
up and give it more structure so give it
a little bit more body here and just
keep in mind that you want to look
straight forward into a mirror and you
want this too so
just jump a little bit out of the crease
now I'm gonna fill that in using a
little bit of makeup geeks eyeshadow in
galaxy and I'll also be taking this
Chanel quad and this is the t-state
Gabrielle and I'm taking the darkest
color in that and mixing it with makeup
geeks galaxy with this just fill this
entire area in now it's time to blend
that out a little bit more so I'm gonna
take that same Chanel quad and mixing
the darkest color with that silvery
pewter II color and that is gonna be my
blending color so very slowly I'm just
gonna put my brush on that line and
wiggle up just a tiny aspec and just
really softly start diffusing that line
and make it a little bit softer and then
with a slightly bigger blending brush
keep diffusing that line I think this is
what will take most of you guys the
longest for the bottom you want to start
up and take that black again and with a
straight line come out of the bottom
lash line and then what you want to do
is flick it out and then from there go
back in and stick in it a little and I
what I'm gonna do is trace that entire
lower lash line all the way to the inner
corners I find this part here to be a
little bit too skinny so I'm giving that
more body for a pop of white gold I'm
gonna take this power point I pencil by
Mac and this is called gilded white with
this I'm going right in between those
two lines and then from the Chanel pot
taking this light white gold color
panning that right on top for a little
bit more sparkle on the waterline I'm
applying
essence a long-lasting eye pencil in
black fever then for some spark on the
lid I'll be taking this pressed pigment
by Mac called jet couture and to make it
look liquidy I'm gonna mix it with this
sealing tail by Illamasqua so first I'm
dabbing some of that sealing gel onto
the place where I want jet Couture to go
and add that on top you really want to
Pat it as soon as you wipe this on your
entire face will be a black glittery
mess we're gonna take the gold leaf and
what they did was stick gold leaf with
some lash glue not entirely on the tear
duct area but sort of more between the
nose bridge and the tear ducts area
which makes it so much more sparkly and
intense and nice so I'm just gonna take
a little bit of this gold leaf and put
some lash glue right here and then stick
it on
now it's time for lashes I'll be using
my EXO beauty Shen EXO's brand the
glamour recess and for my bottom lashes
are gonna take the velour Kardashian's
so let's go on to cheeks when I first
gonna do as always is give herself a
little bit of contouring because I know
the models that the show didn't really
have a lot of contouring going on but
come on I don't really have to face
shape that they have and as always I'm
using my illamasqua heroine eyeshadow
for that I noticed that their blush was
placed a little bit more on top of the
cheekbones right here but there still
was a little bit of warmth going on so
I'm gonna take my disobey by Illamasqua
and just the slightest bit is going on
my forehead on the tops of the
cheekbones little bit on the nose chin
neck wherever if we're blush I'm gonna
take the 'center ah kiss and blush
babydoll in number eight and I'm gonna
put a little bit on the back of my hand
and just kind of take a little bit of
that and tap it on the highest points a
little bit more back of my cheekbones of
the cheeks so it's really a lot higher
up and then blend it really softly and
for highlight are gonna take the tiniest
bit of the bums mary-lou manizer just to
get that glow going for lips you want to
keep it nude and a little bit glossy
with a pop of color
so for lipstick I'm gonna go with
Chanel's adios and then a little bit of
the 186th lip gloss and this is so
bright and so in tongues
