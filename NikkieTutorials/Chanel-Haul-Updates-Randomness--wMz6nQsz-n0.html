week since I uploaded my last video
which was actually still in Butte Ober
and that was my colourful skull tutorial
um after that I kind of Butte Ober was
over I took a break my schedule was
insane basically I wonder how I made it
through October because my schedule was
insane i pre filmed about four videos
for me to wear which is kind of a lot
when you film two or three times a week
it's just it was so insane I had shoots
I had chose did you make up in hair for
um I still teach Abbey Academy so two
days of that were gone in my weeks and
then you tober every other day it was
insane it was a lot of fun but god it
was exhausting so after that Halloween
colourful skull look I just I I went
down I just I needed a break I planned
on doing this October favourites as the
last few Tober video but I just I
couldn't do it anymore I was so tired
and I was like I feel so bad for my
viewers for not uploading anything but I
needed a break so yeah so that is where
I have been I have been missing and gone
but I hope you guys can forgive me for
not doing the last Peter Burke video in
October and I hope you can forgive me
but I'm back it's good to be back
there's been a couple of changes um I've
got new hair um it used to be much more
pink and much more a lie lucky but I got
new hair my roots are sort of this a
lilac purple and then my ends are a
light light pink like a really soft
ombre pink I didn't really have a reason
for it I just wanted something different
and my hair was victims of it I plan on
filming this huge haul because I ordered
Mac I got some Chanel stuff and all this
other crap and MEK didn't arrive I don't
my whole idea sort of into gutters now
because I can do that so I'm just gonna
show you my chanel and OPI stuff and
some other stuff that I want to share
you and I just want to kind of talk
about shows TV shows and just products
that I bought and just kind of I want to
kind of talk to you guys again because I
feel like in Butte over I was so focused
on like the tutorials and I did some
tags but I didn't really talk to you
guys so this is sort of like a chit chat
like where have you been well I've been
here where have you been so the first
thing I really want to talk about is
this is chanel melis ice I shut up melis
and nail-polish and I'm wearing it right
now and I have a blog post on my website

on this I I still have to do like a look
on my eye with these colors so that's
coming up but I absolutely love the
Christmas collection of Chanel is
absolutely fantastic and I definitely
recommend you checking it out then I
also put in a mascara by Shiseido and
this is the perfect mascara defining
volume I got this because the editor in
chief of Teen Vogue tweeted about this
and um she's Asian and she's told
everyone like um this works perfectly
for my Asian lashes so I was like I got
to have that and this is actually
amazing I'm wearing it today and it's
really up to par with my makeup studio
mascara that I'm always using lately I
haven't been wearing a lot of makeup I'm
just kind of wearing mascara I should
say go one and just some BB cream and
the BB cream I'm in love with is the
Misha perfect cover BB cream by Misha
for my Duchess if you don't know where
to get BB cream so you can try BB cream
shop EU
and that is a Dutch online story that
sells so many baby creams I got this one
right there as well so check it out the
link is right here and in the info box
then the last thing I want to show you
is this OPI nail polish in golden eye

foil it's with glitters and it's insane

plan on wearing this after my Chanel

I really was wishing for that it's a
brutal show the
I kind of feel like I went out like on
my second channel I'm really abusing it

should post like videos on my second
