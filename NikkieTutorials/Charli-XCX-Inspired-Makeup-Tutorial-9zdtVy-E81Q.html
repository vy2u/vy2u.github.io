hey guys
today no smoky eyes and new lips know
it's time to go back into fall it's time
to do a inspired makeup tutorial on an
artist that has been loving lately and
she recently came out with a song called
break the rules and for me Charli xcx's
break the rules is the song of the year
period I love the music video I loved
Charli XCX I just I love everything
about her her style is so edgy and cool
and her makeup was awesome and break
their rules so I decided to do a Charli
XCX inspired makeup tutorial especially
particularly inspired by break the rules
so if you want to know how to get this
look right here then please stay tuned
alright the first thing we're gonna do
is pry my face to give it a nice base to
work with and I'm using my hourglass
mineral veil primer for this I have
heard so many amazing things about this
product and that this is actually my
first time trying it I already can tell
it it's very dry but no means feels very
hydrating and nourishing but it is super
soft and velvety hmm I obviously need to
try it a little bit more for a
foundation today I'm going to go with a
BB cream actually this is a new favorite
this is by Garnier and this is the pure
active BB cream I'm really really liking
this one one it's affordable - the
coverage is absolutely amazing and let
me just put it on and you'll see okay
I'm first just gonna put this on my face
wherever I want it and I'm moving this
in with a sigma f80 brush and I can
already tell that the smell of this is
absolutely amazing it has that really
iconic pure active cucumber smell it has
a lovely matte texture which is exactly
what you want because Charli XCX loved
her matte face she does highlight with a
glowy product but the overall feel of
her face is really nice and matte and
what I also really like about this BB
cream is that it actually has coverage
I mean this is a European bb-cream and
normally European BB Creams are more
like a tinted moisturizer you can't
really get much out of them but this one
actually has coverage and it looks nice
and it just it just looks nice on the
skin I really really like it and what
that comes is that it also lasts which
is something I don't find a lot of BB
creams do normally they just fade after
an hour or four but this just stays on
the entire day I'm just a huge fan of
this it's affordable it stays on long it
looks beautiful the structure is
absolutely beautiful it makes you look
matte and perfected and I'm just a huge
huge fan of this BB cream I mean what is
going on with me I used to hate BB
creams and now I love them for concealer
I'm going to go with my Mac nc15 Pro
Longwear concealer and I'm going to make
it a little bit more light to highlight
my face using this Kryolan Creole on id0
a dermablend color
and I'm going to buck this in using my
Sigma f80 sixth brush and reason why I
went so light with my concealer is
because Charlie has an amazing light
complexion and I just wanted to you know
bring out my future's a little bit more
and also by mixing that Pro Longwear
with that creel on a derma blend color
the Creole and derma blend color has a
really nice matte coverage so again
you'll have that really nice porcelain
matte feel I'm now going to set this all
using my chanel natural loose finish
powder at number 20 Clair and also do my
brows off-camera which are going to make
a little bit more dark because Charlie
has really nice intense and dark brows
as well so I'm going to do that all
off-camera and then it will be back so
first I'll be applying a base to my
eyelids to prevent the eyeshadow from
creasing and I'm using my Mac soft ochre
Paint Pot for this then to define my
crease a little bit I'm taking a Mac
sculpting powder called sculpt and with
this and lightly bringing definition
into my crease to make the eyes appear a
little bit more deep set and larger then
with another Mac Pro sculpting powder
called emphasized I am highlighting my
brow bone and inner corners right here
now taking a Makeup Forever aqua cream
in number two and I'm applying this all
over the lid area meeting up into the
crease and this is a beautiful pewter e
silver color just exactly what you want
to go for then once you have that base
down with a more fluffy brush I'm going
to diffuse the edges up and out so it
gets a really nice transition to make
that color catch the light even more I'm
taking results from the Urban Decay
electric palette and I'm lightly packing
that on on the middle of my lid and
diffusing the edges out to the sides and
this way your lid gets a really nice
glowing effect
so the brightest part is in the center
right here and then you diffuse it out
to that pewter II color from makeup
forever
and then it just really catches the
light beautifully for the eyeliner part
I'm taking a matte black eyeshadow and a
first making a line on where I want my
wing to go to now brush some of that
black really closely to the roots of
your lashes and then drag it from that
point to the lashes fill in and then
with another brush you really want to
diffuse the edges of that line you don't
want it to be a really stark and intense
eyeliner you just want it to be a haze
of an eyeliner so go ahead and blend
those edges out and then the same black
color is apply to the roots of the lower
lashes and then at the outer part here
you want to connect it to the liner on
top and then just kind of buff in that
black color on the lower lash line now
for the inner corners of mixing a bit of
Deb Mac sculpting powder in emphasize
with makeup geek eyeshadow in bling
packing that on on the very inner
corners here to open up the eyes and
then you kind of want to look down and
brush it right here now with my
hourglass 1.5 millimeter mechanical gel
liner in obsidian I'm going to line my
waterline and now it's time for mascara
I'm just going to use my makeup studio
waterproof 3d in extra black and on top
a little bit of the Holika Holika magic
pull mascara for the cheeks I'm going to
do a little bit of contouring using my
NYX blush in taupe and a little bit of
the Mac sculpting powder in sculpt and
with those I'm just going to carve out
my cheeks a little bit more to get my
face a bit more definition for blush
Italy is one of my favorite colors
by Mac this is Melba and just dust this
from the contour up to the cheeks so you
start at your contour and then go on to
the cheeks so highlight I'm going to use
another favorite product of mine this is
max pigment in vanilla and this is just
it lightly on the tops of my cheekbones
and then blending the edges out for
Charlie's iconic matte deep red lips I'm
going to use a product mixture of two
lip mixes by Mac called crimson and
black and you just want to use the
tiniest amount of the black to deepen
the crimson color
and that guy's concludes my Charli XCX
break the rules inspired makeup tutorial
