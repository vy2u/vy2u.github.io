I'm gonna be doing a tutorial inspired
by Charlize Theron in the new movie the
Huntsman winters war where she'll be
Queen Ravenna again and she's so laid
the first movie for me that she was
everything I wanted her to live spoiler
alert
so Queen Ravenna Charlize Theron is back
for the second movie which will hit the
ER just April 7th here in the
Netherlands I'm so excited I saw the
first trailers and I went back up and
this movie is all about Emily Blunt
joining the cast cuz she is gonna play
Charlize thorns sister and basically
Emily Blunt it's gonna bring Charlize
Theron back to life and then the sisters
or at least they wanted that until
Jessica Chastain and Chris Hemsworth
came along I highly suggest you check in
the trailers out I'll put a link down
below where you can see it but yeah go
check it out I'm so inspired by this
movie love it so much I don't know so
maybe you can wear this look when you go
see this movie although it's 3d so
you'll be wearing glasses and nobody
will be there to appreciate your beauty
plus it's dark but hey hey hey it's the
thought that matters see it without any
further ado if you would like to know
how to get this Queen Ravenna Charlize
Theron the Huntsman winters War inspired
makeup look then please keep on watching
all right guys the first thing we're
going to do is moisturize because we
want our skin to look young and radiant
so I'm gonna go in with my Cetaphil
moisturizing cream first and following
through using my pixi by petra hydrating
milky mist give it a nice little shake
and spray for foundation today I'm gonna
go in with the L'Oreal infallible Pro
matte 24 hour foundation and I'm in the
color 101 classic ivory and I'm gonna be
working it in using my Beauty Blender
for concealer I'll be using the it
cosmetics bye bye under-eye in light
and again blend in using my Beauty
Blender and sometimes after all that
blending it can dry up a little bit more
so I like to go back in with that milky
more shrines than mist and kind of re
dampen it
and now setting it using mine our soft
velvet loose powder in snow like Snow
White and since you don't want this
foundation to go anywhere throughout the
day it's a good idea to now set it with
powder and my favorite brush for that is
the morphe m4 4 for this just packs in
that powder like a dream and for my
under eyes i really like using this
makeup geek angled stippling brush so a
combination of these two for powder is
amazing and the powder i used for like
alter of my face is my Mac Studio Fix in
nw15 and as I get closer underneath my
eyes I mix this with the NARS powder
setted baby right here on the cheeks I
don't mix it with the NARS powder yet
but as soon as I hit that like on your
eye area I know that I should be mixing
so I mixed a powder on the brush I'm
gonna underneath set and wipe away the
bake and for like this spot I'm sure I
like to take a smaller brush this is by
Sephora and it's the pro press full
coverage precision but I've kind of
going on a pax the powder in there
because one of my biggest makeup pet
peeves is when like that side of the
nose is all shiny and I like them sides
of the nose to be matte as always super
thing going in with is of course my Mac
soft ochre Paint Pot to keep this look
on all day long people always ask me why
I never changed this one up no it's like
it's like would you put your child up
for adoption when you've had your child
for like five years
no up you love it and you won't leave it
you know some products are just meant to
stick with you forever going in with the
amazing two-faced sweet peach palette
and going in with the color white peach
with a Mac 252 I'm just going to start
highlighting my brow and then dragging
it down so really apply this from brow
bone to crease and this will make
blending later on extremely easier for
the crease of mixing this color right
here with charmed I'm sure
and doing that softly using a Mac two to
four brush I want to go all the way
towards the inner crease with this color
because it's going to be dramatic and
evil and smoky so we really want to make
an impact here by going all the way to
that inner corner
here also focus on really blending it
onto that outer corner here and smoking
it up and out I guess that you want this
lip to be super dramatic so don't be
afraid go out make that way and I keep
telling you guys the further you go up
the less pressure you want to put on
that brush the softer you apply that
shadow once you go higher up the nicer
the blend you can you can like really
stamp it in here at the base of the
crease but the higher you go up soft
pressure for a really nice defined line
I like going back in with that 252 and
white peach and really clean up
underneath tape is unnecessary all you
need is a highlight color and brush and
clean it up and also let's say you feel
like oh my god I just dusted some of the
eyeshadow and I tasted it it's just like
peach it's amazing if you feel like your
blending is a little bit off-key you can
always go back in with that brush and
kind of soften right at the edge I'm
just really softly making it a little
bit soft and your blended with charmed
I'm sure
mi zueva 234 I'm darkening my inner and
outer thirds for the living going to go
ahead and take herbal case gold mine eye
shadow which is gorgeous and with a damp
mac 242 brush just applied to the center
of the lid and blend out
now going in with tempting and darkening
that inner and outer corner even more
for the lower lashline I'm now applying
the colour-pop cream gel liner in swerve
and really apply from inner to outer
corner and now it's a pencil brush and
charmed I'm sure
only I'm going to buff that lower lash
line out there really darkening it using
tempting and also really darkening those
inner corners to have a base for the
gold later on and you guessed it with my
zueva 240 and gold mine I'm going to
blast those inner corners with gold not
to finish off all you want to do is
apply some natural falsies and these are
the Ardell with okay since I'm looking
like Snow White and looking like a ghost
it's time to do some contouring and
bronzing so for contouring today I'm
going to try the new makeup geek
contouring powder and I'm going to go in
with the lightest two shades de sel
that makes sure of both oh just look at
the gym run and then with the morphe m4
four four four four four all the fours
you can kind of soften it and clean up
the line underneath then for bronze are
gonna go in with the elf bronzer palette
and this is in bronze beauty and I'm
gonna take this color right here I love
that color it reminds me a lot of the
cover effect Sunkist love it great dupe
for bless you don't want to apply too
much but yet you do want to add some
life and youth to that face of yours so
I'm gonna go in with the Mac blush in
what I fancy and micro step number two
brush and bounce them cheeks and for
highlighter I'm going to glow the
enemies the way use an unescapable hills
sunburst
her lips are gonna keep it nude and you
know a queen like because I feel like
the eyes are such a statement so Newt
lips it is so I'm going to go in with
the two-faced lipstick and topless first
and making it a little bit lighter using
melts a sext
and to finish it all off I'm going to
use a setting spray this one's by Bo
shot and it's the white charcoal
mattifying makeup setting spray and now
that I've got my most luxurious Queen
hair on ever that concludes my Queen
Ravenna charlize theron the Huntsman
winters war that's such a mouthful
