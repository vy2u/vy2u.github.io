tutorial on charcoals new music video
called crazy stupid Nutter order sure
we'll hoard this amazing copper sort of
liquid copper crazy smokey eye and I
absolutely loved it
two or two times in the video because
she were with a nude lip and with a
really dark vampy lip and I'll be
showing you the new look today if you
couldn't tell so yeah this is just a
really great party smokey eye it really
brings out the green and the blue in
someone's eyes you've got that in your
eyes but if you ask me this would look
great with all skin tones all eye colors
all face shapes all everything it looks
good on everyone yeah without any
further ado if you want to know how to
get this show we'll call Krazy Stoopid
love makeup look then keep on watching
okay so first things first I'm gonna
apply a bit of a moisturizer slash
primer and for that I'm gonna use my Mac
prep and prime natural radiance in
radiant yellow so I'm just gonna take a
bit of that and let my face bathes in it
then because in all of my recent videos
I've only used the l'oreal true match
foundation i kind of wanted to switch
things up a bit so today I'm gonna use
the Mac mineralized moisture foundation
and this is NC 15 this is also one of
the foundations I love for a day to day
wear because it's just really radiant
and glowy it just gives a beautiful
finish and because I've been really
liking that mixture with the Select
cover up concealer by Mac I'm also gonna
add this into the mix so these two are
gonna go on to my complexion right now
and I am going to apply this with my
makeup geek Foundation stippling brush I
love this finish it's absolutely sunny
it's not too much it's not too little it
gives a beautiful healthy sheen I love
this foundation so much okay let's go on
to concealer for concealer I'm actually
really excited to use this today I
learned this trick from Jacqueline Hill
so I'm going to take the Mac Pro
Longwear and
c15 nothing new here but instead of
buffing it in with my fingers or with my
Real Techniques complexion miracle
complexion sponge whatever I will be
taking the Sigma tapered kabuki SAT six
brush and apparently this is an under
eye concealer sort of liquid heaven
miracles so I am so excited to try this
out you have no idea so I'm going to
place my pro longwear concealer under my
eyes just as I usually would in that
Halfmoon shape and then as usual to
further highlight my face I'll be taking
the Mac prep and prime highlighter in
radiant rose and this just to further
bring out features in my face and first
I'm gonna tap it in with my finger for
the most part and here comes the moment
of truth
I'm gonna take the f-86 and I'm gonna
land that concealer in and I am going to
see if all the raids by Jaclyn it's true
and god damn it it is true holy
that's gorgeous
I really like how you can get really
close to the inner corners without
really poking your eyes out so it's plus
two the rest of my face with it as well
oh my gosh you guys so it is true it
does work wonders for blending out
liquid concealer or just liquid stuff
you put on your face what I'm gonna do
now is brows and powder so I'm gonna
powder my face and do my brows and for
breath today I'll be using my Anastasia
brow Wiz in ash blonde because it's it's
awesome
every brow powder instead of using my
Anastasia brow powder duo in Aires
blonde taupe today I am going for a new
Sigma product this is the brow powder in
light and I am really liking what I'm
seeing here so I'm gonna try that out a
bit off-camera and if you want to see a
full tutorial on how I do my brows you
can check in the infobox below for a
link right back okay so the first thing
I of course did was prime my eyelids to
blend the eyeshadow from creasing and
for that I use my Mac soft ochre Paint
Pot the first shadows I'll be using are
a couple of mix together so I'll be
taking Coco bear and
mocha by makeup geek and I'm also going
in my Sigma warm neutrals palette and
I'll be taking a russet right there and
what I'm gonna do with this is first
line my lower lash line with this and
really bring in that impact here so from
the lower lash line I'm going to drag it
up and this will be a guideline for
where I want my crease to go later on
from that same warm initial spillage I'm
going into this color right here this is
called cinnamon and I'm mixing these two
together and I'm further defining my
lower lash line with that combo and I'm
going all the way in with this combo I'm
also blending it down quite a bit
because that will give that relief soft
grungy smoky look now with the same
colors I'm gonna start going into my
crease and the crease was really precise
and almost cut in this look so I really
want that dark brown to have its place I
don't want it to be too blended but I
don't want it to be too harsh either so
slowly but surely I'm building up my
crease here and going half way in then
I'm also gonna take it from that outer
corner and bring it to my lash line to
create this sort of eyeliner feeling
here on the outer edge now I'm gonna
take a small imprecise blending brush
and going back into cinnamon by Sigma
with this I'm lightly gonna blend and
diffuse out the darkness in the crease
above it so go ahead and blow this out
now with a more concentrated brush I'm
going back into those darker colors and
re intensifying that entire outer thing
we just created going back into that
pallet and taking sugar milk and
highlighting my brow bone with this and
this is also your chance to really blend
out that crease and make it seamless as
soon as I saw the music video and I saw
Cheryl looking down I knew she was
wearing coppering by Mac on top of her
lids coppering is one of those colors
that you recognized
immediately so I'm just gonna take
coppering and apply that all over my lid
meeting with the dark colors here and
I'm also blending that up into the
crease here so it seems as if that dark
brown color is connected to the inner
part of the lip but is actually the
copper ring
I have no idea if that made any sense in
fact with a blending brush I'm just
gonna take a little bit of the copper
ring and blend it into my crease meeting
with the dark Browns and you guys sit
going back in with the darker colors and
re intensifying all that because I like
that lid to be a little bit more sparkly
and intense I'm gonna take a pigment by
makeup geek and this is called Vegas
alight and to make this stick I'm gonna
take my Illamasqua sealing gel so this
is gonna go first this is going on top
and then you get that really intense spa
cleanness and just Pat that all over
where you applied coppering and oh my
gosh can we look at this it's like
liquid copper to highlight my inner
corners I'll be using a little bit of
the bombs mary lou manizer on the
waterline I'll be applying a little bit
of my essence long-lasting eyeliner in
black fever and this is really hard to
do on camera because I just want to dive
into my mirror and oh oh god I am going
to dive into my mirror now and of course
to finish this entire look off we need a
little bit of extreme winged eyeliner
and for this I'll be using my Catrice a
liquid liner in dating Jo black and just
make it thick and long and just think
along
okay now some for some mascara and
lashes and for this I'll be using my
makeup studio water / 3d and extra black
and for my bottom lashes I'll be taking
my Mac extended play gigablack lash and
then for lashes I'll be taking my XO
Beauty glamour east eyelashes and I love
how full and wispy and girly these are
so this winning trio is going onto my
eyes okay so for cheeks you first want
to sculpt and give yourself some warmth
and I'm gonna start off with my
Illamasqua eyeshadow in heroine and cut
those cheeks with this baby
Krazy Stoopid contour I'm also gonna do
my temples a bit and my hairline because
why not so warm up my face you guessed
it I'm using my Illamasqua blush in
disobeyed with a big brush and just
slightly warming up the highest points
my face a bit there for blush is Cheryl
wore a really nice pinky touch so I'm
gonna mix because you wouldn't be
watching a video on my channel where I
want to mix the product so I'm gonna
start off with my Tarte Amazonian clay
blush in doll face and for a little bit
of shine and shimmer I'm gonna take the
Milani berry a more blush for my face
highlight and going back into my double
mary lou manizer because i love it free
lips you want to go for a really nice
nude with a pop of coral pink so that is
exactly what we're gonna do today
efforts gonna line my lips using my
Lancome LeConte or lip pencil in beige
roads 211 for lips I'll be taking this
matte lipstick in off royalty and then
for the top lip we're gonna take this
hourglass nude number one femme nude
lipstick goddamn longing and I'm just
gonna fill in my upper lip with this
and then you want a smack and then four
cloths are gonna use my NYX butter gloss
in maple blondie and that just adds a
little bit more pink to the look and
