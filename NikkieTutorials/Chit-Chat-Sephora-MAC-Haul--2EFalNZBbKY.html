to kind of sit down have a chitchat and
show you some things that I ordered from
sephora.com
because the partnership's here to
Holland so of course needed some stuff I
feel like I haven't sat down for a
really long time and actually talked to
you guys and actually you know sat down
and had a chit chat and talked about
life and what's going on and all that
magic so today is gonna be right that
and by the time you're watching this
video I'm actually on a little short of
vacay with the boyfriend
I am off to Spain and I don't know how
to pronounce it in English but it's
called mala ha where I'm going to it's a
really nice small little town I believe
and we're visiting family there so it's
gonna be so so so nice we're only going
for six days but it's just to kind of
recharge and you know enjoy the culture
and the Sun and the food and everything
and just a little short vacay life has
been super hectic because I've been so
busy with filming videos and freelance
jobs and just photoshoots and shows and
all that good stuff but um life is good
it feels good to be so so busy because
it's it's a good sign that you're busy
and actually me and my boyfriend aren't
looking for houses apartments houses
whatever we can pay because we think
it's time to go live with each other by
ourselves so gone from our parents it
definitely feels very scary and it gives
me a little bit of anxiety but I think
it's time and we found some amazing
places I just did not know that houses
or apartments could be so expensive so
we're still looking for like the perfect
place and we think we have found it but
now we just have to get around and find
out how we're gonna pay for it because
we we gotta have a mortgage and
everything because we want to buy a
house not rent a house it's gonna be
quite the ride and it's gonna be so new
and and you know nerve-racking at the
same time but I think it's gonna be good
too that we finally have our own place
and then I can
has a film studio in my own house I'm
now filming in my bedroom and I think
it's gonna be very good for me to have
that film room where I can actually sit
down leave all the junk leave all the
lights and just you know get creative
and crazy so I will talk a little bit
more about life throughout the products
but I want to show you the first few
products that I got I have been slightly
obsessing over the entire brand
hourglass lately just everything I seem
to try from them is amazing so I was
like whatever I'm gonna buy it's gonna
be good alright so the first products I
got from hourglass is a new ambient
lighting powder this is called luminous
light I have two shades already I have
ethereal light and I have luminous light
but they're all a little bit more on the
glow we met sheer satin finish side and
I wanted something with the same texture
and the same feel and the same look but
just a little bit more glowy and intense
and shimmery and shiny for me it might
have been a little bit more on the
shimmery side because I kinda it gives
that beautiful soft glow from within
look but I like a little bit of a
stronger glow from within look also I've
been hearing absolute great things about
the Becca highlighters and I'm talking
about these shimmering skin perfectors
but then pressed as in a powder form and
I got the color moonstone which is out
of this world I mean look at that it's a
very pale yellow Goldy toned shimmer
it's absolutely stunning I haven't tried
it yet I know this is definitely gonna
give me a lot more glow and shine than
luminous light by hourglass but oh I
can't wait to dig into this one maybe
for on like my vacay in Spain where I'm
like walking down the streets with the
son of my face and then the beautiful
moonstone glow on my cheeks can't wait
to wear it this also from hourglass I
got the brow sculpting pencil it's
called arc I believe and this is the
color soft brunette and it comes with a
little spooley on one portion of the
pencil and then
this is what the pencil looks like it
has a really nice triangular shape
people need to stop it with that
Illuminati and it's just a really
nice a she toned medium brown color and
as you can see it has that little human
heart a sign I haven't tried this on
either I'm afraid it's gonna be a little
bit too thick because I really like to
have that sharp tail but still I can't
wait to dig into this and try it out and
how it wear is in all that but I am
going to do a full blog post review on
this once I trade out so I cannot swash
it yet I'm so sorry I got a backup of my
Anastasia brow Wiz in mm ash wand which
is now renamed to taupe I'm really
liking this it's it's probably one of my
all-time holy grail favorite brow
products the yeah the brow is by uh
Nastasia is also I want to talk about
this because in my previous hits and God
knows I have talked about the dip brow
pomade by anastacio and it was a huge
letdown to me I didn't like the color
the consistency it just didn't work out
for me and they recently unassessed air
released new colors and the new colors
one of them is taupe and it's a little
bit more on the topi gray ashy err side
of life and it's just okay I am planning
on doing a video on this but I have
finally after so many months figured out
how to use this damn thing and it's
amazing it doesn't budge
you can sweat your ass off and just the
eyebrows don't move they stay in place
the color stays intact
it just let's see what fun thing I've
seen other gurus do this I was like okay
I'm gonna do that one day if you want to
see a video on how to make the Anastasia
brow pomade work coming from someone who
hated it
so I actually made it work down they
liked this video you have to like this
video give it a thumbs up and as
soon as it gets 5,000 thumbs up I will
do that for you I will still do it for
you if we don't reach the 5000 but its I
just want to kind of experiment with
this kind of know what it does kind of
know why all the other girls do it
5000 let's make it let's make it work I
have a bunch stuff damn okay mt mt mt I
also got the calf on D tattoo liner in
trooper and I asked you guys on Twitter
what is the best catch one D product you
own and my entire feed got bombarded
with you have to get tattoo liner in
trooper so I was like okay I better get
to the basket puts the lotion in the
basket rub solution into skin so the
tattoo liner in trooper I made blog post
review pictures for this I just have to
try it out I have to brush it onto my
eyes I haven't done that yet but I got
that ooh another Kat Von D product I got
it was the I did not raise those dogs
well enough these started kiss lipstick
I can't swatch this because I still want
to do a blog post review on it but can
we talk about the packaging the
packaging is just this entire studded
case oh my gosh
and the color I got is home girl and
it's a super super dark almost black
color which I'm all about that lately so
I'm gonna do a tutorial using this and
I'm gonna do a blog post review on it
next is by Too Faced this is a melted
liquefied long-wear lipstick in melted
Ruby I did a full blog post review on
this and you can find the link down
below in the infobox if you want to see
that this is just holy it's like a
bloody red lusciousness for on the lips
it's absolutely amazing and a lot of
people have hyped about this and I was
like so I started out with melted Ruby
and it definitely is amazing so I
definitely want to buy
another hourglass product I got the 1.5
millimeter mechanical gel liner also did
a full blog post review on this you can
find the link down below and this is a
revolutionary new product because it is
a tip of an gel eyeliner
that's 1.5 millimeters it's absolutely
insane it's great it's like the Holy
Grail for tight lining and again I did a
full blog post review on that so if you
want to know more about that now please
watch read that oh here we go
I got the Viva Glam this is not from
Sephora I got this from the PR I got the
Viva Glam stick Brianna - so many people
have been waiting for swatches and like
in-depth review so I felt the need to be
that person that does that for all of
you so I got these Viva Glam Rihanna to
set and I'm gonna be brutally honest but
I don't know I'm on the fence about this
one I I love that they went for
something new and extreme and out there
but it's just not the right extreme and
new and out there I will be doing a
video using this set in September - so
watch out for that if you want to know
what this looks like in video but for
now you can check out the blog post
review I also from Mac got the Simpsons

productive on the blog so the grand
