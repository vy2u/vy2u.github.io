ago since I've actually filmed the
tutorial like the last when I upload it
with Kelly Osbourne and I think I found
that about 2 or 3 weeks ago so I've so
missed you guys like so so much um so it
feels really good to be back although
you don't really missed me because I
still upload it so for me it's been so
long since I've actually talked to you
guys so yet today I just want to give
you some updates on my life and some
announcements so the first thing on my
list is New York I'm filming this on
Monday the 9th of April and actually
this Thursday I am leaving to New York
this weekend is I Mets New York City and
I'm going again I went last year as well
and it was such an amazing experience
and all the people were so nice that I
met in New York and I fell in love with
New York last year so this year decided
to go again and I'm not going alone I'm
going with one of my best internet
friends I'm going with Jake F Shumlin
twice a day here on YouTube so actually
this Thursday I am going to Amsterdam
and then from Amsterdam I'm going to New
York City so I'm super excited about it
it's my first time like really going
alone like really flying alone so if you
see me walking by in New York City it is
me it's not it's not like a double
ganger and so yeah I will be at I'm it's
New York again there's one thing though
please Dutchess help me like I know that
when you have to go from Amsterdam to
New York I know what you have to do what
customs and all the like security stuff
but I don't know how it works when you
go back so do you have to like check in
24 hours before you leave again in New
York and then do all this stuff please
help me down below because I'm so
insecure about it please help me then I
also bought a new laptop last week I
bought a MacBook I'm looking at it right
now I bought a MacBook Pro 15 inch and
then the best of the best
I had an Acer thing with Windows and
editing my videos was a pain in the
because it froze and it crashed and it
was a disaster so I finally decided to
get a MacBook because I know that
everyone is talking about netbooks that
was such a pain in the ass because I had
to relearn how to edit all over again
because I always used to edit with Sony
Vegas Pro but that's not for Mac so I
had to learn to edit with Final Cut Pro
and I've actually edited my Kelly
Osborne one with that but the lighting
was so of because it was a new program I
left this clipping with me singing which
was awkward as hell and I'm even like oh
so awkward so I kind of forgot some
clips in that video and I even typed in
click here for my previous video my was
may I suck so yeah that kind of explains
why that video is sort of a mess and the
colors homes are a mess I'm so pink and
I'm so red and so the last thing I just
want to say for this video is I'm going
to New York this Thursday and I haven't
filmed any video so there will be like a
week without it there will be like a
week and a half of me not posting any
videos because I'm in New York and I'm
not gonna bring my macbook because it's
too precious to me do you have any
requests I've been doing videos for
three and a half years now almost four
and after almost four years
your ideas are sort of like all the rest
you've done already
your looks start to look alike it's it's
the honest truth like sometimes I'm like
what the hell is there left to film I'm
just putting it out there it's just my
honest truth I still love love love
doing videos I love you guys love the
comments love sitting in front of this
camera and stuff so that is why I wanted
to ask you for some requests just name
whatever you like and even if you have
photos I don't know if that works but
maybe post them on my Facebook page I'm
gonna put on a setting that you can post
it or something it's just like
please give me requests because I'm sort
of out of ideas I still have one video
plan but it's tough to film in it is for
The Hunger Games and it is inspect why
if there is a hair in front of the
camera fight please come out with some
requests I really really need them so
yeah that is all for today that are just
some things that I wanted to share with
you so yeah how are you guys doing I
haven't talked to you guys for so long
how's your life how's your day but if
you're done with Easter did you like
Easter I mean have you got any regrets
for me are you going to IMATS if you're
still watching through the bomb you
flashed it all the way through the end
and I really appreciate that so um what
thing I guess so much for watching and
hopefully I will see you guys in my next
video which will be in about one and a
half week two weeks okay
bye guys I love you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
