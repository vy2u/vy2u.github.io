on Christina I kill the rest
Christina always wears like her cat eye
with bright red lips and in this video
it was the same but just a little bit
more of my taste sort of and it is so
different for me to wear bright red lips
normally I hate that color on me but I
don't know why but I kind of like it now
I hope you guys like it and if you want
to know how I did this then please keep
on watching
the first thing you want to do is apply
a base to your lips to prevent your eyes
from creasing I used my Michael taught
nude cream eyeshadow first color so I'm
going to use our gesso by Mac and gesso
is just a pure white matte color the
second color is called love to love
mineralize eyeshadow trio by Mac as well
knows that color right there it is
beautiful it has just beautiful Sheen
which is not too harsh but really pretty
and though I have some gesso on my brush
and then I take this love to love trio
and take that light color and put this
on to do it and at first it looks like
really dull and not pretty at all but
you want to make it like a really light
color so I'm just gonna reapply the
colors until I like it then I like to
take that love to love trio line I
shadow color only on the brush and apply
this to the inner corners go up we're
also gonna do the brow bone highlight
with these colors so I'm gonna get some
gesso and some of the love to love light
color and the plight is right under the
arch of your eyebrow Kristina has a
really light yet defined crease in her
video so I'm gonna take a copper plate
by Mac and this is like a grey brownish
color it looks great but when it's
applied it turns to to this brownish
gray color I love this color I used it
for my brows as well I use two colors on
my brows so yeah this is going on to the
crease I'm gonna grab my 226 by stigma
and I'm gonna just take a little bit of
the copper plate by Mac and I'm just
using a little bit because the crease in
the video
like so I'm just going to tilt my hat
back so you can see your crease and just
work it in there just work it in
now take a little bit more and blend it
up so you go a little bit higher up for
the lower lid I'm just gonna grab copper
plate again and smudge just along my
entire lower lid and then just make a
darker with a little bit of mystery
eyeshadow but first let's do the copper
plate then just take a teeny teeny teeny
bit of mystery and just darken it a
little bit just a little bit now I'm
gonna grab this Mac I call and this is a
chroma graphic pencil in pure white you
can use fascinating it's just I don't
have it now I'm going to grab my Mac
black truck fluid line and my stargazer
pencil brush and we're just gonna do
like a really soft yet really dramatic
bold winged eyeliner so this is the
fluent line and this is the brush and
I'm just gonna spray lip brush into the
product I always like to start in the
middle of my lid
and then I like to go in
and work my way out
like that and then it's time for the
wing how I like to do it is I like to
follow my lower lip if you imagine aliy
is that a word if you were like pull
your lower leg all the way further like
it doesn't stop it will go in one
direction I like to follow that
direction just like that don't make it
any more black and stuff and then I like
to just take a point and go in and fill
it up and just make that nice thick and
black just like that side
now that that is done I'm just gonna
apply some mascara and of course curl
them first
I'm gonna use my L'Oreal volume lashes
million thing and then I'm gonna apply
some false lashes I'm gonna use false
lashes from Manic Panic I lost a
container but they look like I will show
it on my cheek Oh like really long and
thin and wispy I love that the first
thing I'm going to use is the Mac lip
erase two completely blank out my lips
now I'm going to take this rat lip liner
by Rimmel London in the color o 24 red
diva
once you've line your lips just fill
them in with the same pencil
now we're going to use this my axel
lipstick called Snow White and it looks
like that and then because Christina
were kind of a glossy finish to her lips
I'm going to use my OCC lip tar in
not-safe-for-work
and just Pat that on top to give it a
little bit of a gloss okay so that
completes this Christina Aguilera are
you next I get my chair it goes like if
you have any questions about anything
just leave them in the comment section
below thank you guys so much for
watching and I will see you guys next
