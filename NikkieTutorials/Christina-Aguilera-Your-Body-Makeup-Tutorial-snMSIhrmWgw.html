a Christina Aguilera your body music
video tutorial I love love love the
scene where there's a tanning bed in the
middle of nowhere and she's just
pretending her leg and then she's like
bitches I'm out by the moment when she
punches that guy with the baseball bat i
I just pure like genius like the
confetti coming out and just I love this
video so much she's wearing the same
eyes in the entire video so I'm going to
show you how to do that and then also
which colors you could wear for your
lips because she's wearing like 4 colors
throughout the entire video so yeah if
you want to know how to get this
Christina I can only write your body
music video look then please keep on
watching so the first thing you want to
do is apply a base to your eyelids to
pretend your eyeshadow from creasing and
I want to be using is my Mac soft ochre
hip-hop the first color I'm going to use
is Mac's blank type and I'm going to use
a really really big brush for that and
what I'm going to do is just pack this
onto my lid and my inner corners and
then I'm just going to go to my brow
bone as well and kind of all over so
just dust this all over your eye space
area then I'm going to take a smaller
brush and then concentrate it a little
bit more onto my lid and then also under
my brow again now I'm going to bring
some definition back into my crease
using Mac's kid and copper plates and
just start defining your crease with
this we're not really focusing on the
shape just yet just going your natural
crease and blend it out and make it more
defined and we will worry about shapes
and stuff later on
and I'm going to darken the entire
crease up a little bit more with
copperplate only and then I'm going to
wing it out here at the outer part of my
crease and then go back in and make it
look good and that's our blending this
is if there's no tomorrow maybe as if
you're a genie in a bottle huh for the
bottom I'm going to take copperplate
only and just to find your lower
lashline this look was pretty
straightforward actually they just did
some definition in her crease lower
lashline then are really clean lids and
brow bone a lot of lashes and then they
changed up the lip like three times and
I think it looked gorgeous I'm going to
brush some kid on the inner part of my
lower lash line for my waterline I'm
going to use my Ben Nye neutralizer
cream crayon in red concealer np3
okay now it's time for the eyeliner and
for that I'm going to use my trusty old
Mac black truck fluid line and for the
eyeliner it's just a really classic
winged eyeliner and kind of thick and
kind of winged out
I get what I'm now going to do is curl
my lashes and then apply some fake
lashes on top I'm not going to apply any
mascara because if you look closely to
music video christina has some blonde
hairs blonde lashes peeking through her
fake lashes and I was like huh what's
going on
so I made a scream shot and I zoomed in
and you could see that the makeup artist
left her blonde natural lashes out so
she didn't put any mascara on them and
that gives a really nice sort of
dimensional finish to your eyelashes so
no mascara you are gonna apply a lot of
false lashes so for my top lashes I'm
going to use my Ardell whispies yeah and
then really simply I'm going to apply
three single lashes on my lower lash
line at the outer corner and for that
I'm going to use my Mac number 30 single
lashes and just three right there so one
two three so just go ahead and go apply
your lashes now fur lips Christina were
the same eyes throughout the entire
video what did change were her lips as
she were about three four colors
throughout the entire video the first
lip which I'm going to do in a second is
the one where she has the different
colors in her hair and sort of like at
the ranch where she's like dancing he
started dry-humping the wall so for that
color I am going to make a mixture
between Mac's
lip mix and crimson and I gotta make it
a little bit more pink because in the
video it had a blue filter on top of it
which made it look pink and I love that
for then I'm going to use pink eenie by
sleek and this is a lip art thing so
this is for the main lip at the wrench
where she's dry-humping the wall for the
pink lip when she sort of knocked the
guy out with her baseball uh stick um
and then all the confetti comes out of
his head I think her outside of his
peewee you never know where the pink
color I suggest a mixture between WeDo
outs Dole house pink this and then to
make it a little bit more glossy
L'Oreal's caress oh seven cheeky magenta
on
up and then you will get a really really
gorgeous stunning bright pink color like
that and then she's also wearing this
really glossy like baby pink lips and
for that I suggest bury em number 100
which is a really really pale baby pink
and then just put a gloss on top but I'm
going to go for the fuchsia red color
and that is Mac's crimson and sleek's
pinky
just keep on going okay so to contour my
face I use my NYX blush in taupe and to
warm up my face a little bit more I use
my Omsk blush in disobey then as an
actual blush I use the illamasqua powder
blush in naked rose and just really
lightly you don't want to go too far
with it and then of course as a
highlight because I love highlights
I use my Mac's mineralize skinfinish in
soft and gentle and that guys completes
my Christina Aguilera your body music
