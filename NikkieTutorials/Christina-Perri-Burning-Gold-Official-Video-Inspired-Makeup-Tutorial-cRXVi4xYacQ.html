from christina perri for burning gold
and I absolutely love this song and as
soon as I saw the music video and I saw
all her amazing makeup looks I knew I
had to do a tutorial for one of them my
favorite one this look right here is
inspired by when Christina is on the set
with these sort of gold ring lights
behind her as she had this amazing gold
dress on and then this hair up and then
just this starting makeup that I think
looks absolutely amazing
so here I am today doing this inspired
tutorial for you and yeah okay if you
want to know how to get this christina
perri burning gold inspired makeup look
then please keep on watching alright so
the first thing I want to do for this
look is prime and give myself a really
nice radiant base to work with the title
of the song of course is burning gold
and just christina looks absolutely
flawless and radiant and glowy and just
like pert and ain't no one looks like
bringing gold except some people in
Instagram they they can't look like
burning gold so I'm gonna go with the
combo that I feel love using most lately
it's these two right here this is my
Becca shimmering skin Perfector in opal
and I'm mixing that with a Chanel
Leblanc umm someone told me that it's a
la blah and Leblanc so and I like going
one pump of each so one pump of Leblanc
and one pump of Becca shimmering skin
perfector I mix it on my fingers tah tah
tah she'll show shawl and I just apply
it and then I just start a rubbing in
some foundation I want to go for a
really nice traceless foundation that
you can't really detect but it still
gives you a really flawless finish for
that I'll be using Mac's face and body
foundation in c1 and because I want to
give that a little bit more coverage I'm
gonna go with
Mac select cover-up concealer and this
is nw15 and these two together just give
you a really nice flawless foundation
without going too far and then I'm just
going to take some of the foundation and
distribute it all over my face
that's a distribute I never say
distribute and I'm going to be buffing
this in with my Sigma f80 flat top
kabuki brush to further perfect the face
I'm gonna go with a little bit of
concealer this is max Pro Longwear in NC
15 and that's just going underneath my
eyes and on the highest points of my
face to you for the highlight a bit and
I'll be doing that and then with my
Sigma F 86 tapered kabuki brush I'm
going to buff this in really easily and
really simply and just you went above in
okay what an Obi doing is setting this
with powder I'm gonna go with my Chanel
natural loose finish powder in a little
bit along with Clair 20 so I'm gonna do
brows and one eye off-camera and then as
always I'll be back so the first thing I
did was apply base to my lids to prevent
the eyeshadow from creasing and I used
my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot for this and
the first eyeshadow I'll be using is a
nylon by Mac what I'll be doing with
nylon is applying this to the very inner
corner of my eyes also be sure to go
right here on the lower lash line and
because Kristina also had this color on
the inner third of her lid I'm applying
some right there also now I'm going to
go into this color right here this is my
diamond effects and this is from the
gemstone collection and this pigment is
called Goldstone and I'm picking some of
that up with my finger and I'm patting
it on the outer half of my lid blending
in with night
I'm gonna go into this pigment right
here this is gold deluxe by sugarpill
and I'm mixing this with a little bit of
illamasqua sealing gel so this is what
my little pace that looks like and then
you want to take that with a brush start
tapping it on between gold stone and
nylon and softly start blending that in
to give it a really nice diffused blend
and then also of course blend nylon in a
little bit better but just give it a
really nice transition and make it look
really seamless and blended Samantha
where want my eyeliner to go I'm gonna
go in this black from these softbox a
tude palette and literally all you want
to do with this is map that eyeliner out
for the other eye I did the complete
eyeliner with shadow and went on top
with a gel liner now if we take a little
closer look at the other eye you want to
start off with a winged liner going all
the way up to the crease I kind of aimed
it towards the end of my eyebrow and
then from there you want to make a cut
crease and it starts off quite thick but
it becomes a thinner and thinner once
you get to this inner corner here and
then you just want to make your winged
liner and just fill this up and connect
the parts and then you want to do the
bottom now it's actually kind of hard to
explain what to do so I'm just going to
show you and speed forward and I hope
then it will be clear
okay so once you've got the rough shape
you kind of want to add layer upon layer
stroke upon stroke to thicken this part
up here
okay now I think is a good time to start
with the gel eyeliner and the one I'm
gonna use is by Sigma and this is called
wicked and I'm just gonna intensify all
the lines and wherever I feel like it
needs a little bit more I'm just gonna
add more you know kind of perfect the
shape and then if you want to clean up
the gold part just take a little bit
more of that mixture we made before I'm
just gonna re dampen it with my sealing
gel and then with an eyeliner brush I'm
gonna take that mixture and put it right
underneath the black line and with this
you can totally sharpen up and clean up
any mistakes u.s. made for the actual
eyeliner part across the lash line I'm
gonna take my dating Jo black liquid
liner by Catrice and I want it to be
quite thick and full because once you
look straight ahead you want to see
nothing but the black and then when you
look down it's like hey BAE I'm gold and
then to connect this part to that part
right here you just want to kind of
raise your eyebrow so this becomes flat
and then from this corner right here
drag it in and really fill that up for
the bottom I'm taking the black shadow
again and running it really closely
along my lower lash line and what we're
going for here is that this point right
here came all this way down you kind of
want this line to meet up with it but
still not really connect and meet up you
just want them to know kind of they're
missing their first date so what I'm
gonna do with the eye shadow again is
sort of create a new lower lash line
like that and now you want to thicken it
up a little bit
okay now we want to create this little
wing right here and that's really easy
to do again take that black eyeshadow
and simply from here create the second
wing and then you just want to connect
it to that bottom okay now be taking
this hourglass a 1.5 millimeter
mechanical gel liner and I'm gonna line
my waterline with this till about
halfway in and it's super super
pigmented it goes on very easily and it
lasts like a rock the time
finally has come for mascara and lashes
and for mascara I'll be using my
waterproof 3d extra black by makeup
studio and for lashes I'm gonna go with
XO beauty's feline lashes for the top
top portion and for lower lashes I'm
gonna go with Mac's 33 I believe and
just pop those on the lower lash line
because she Kristina was rocking some
very bold lower lashes so I'm gonna do
that right now off camera just skip
ahead and just save some time and then I
will be back I'm gonna give my face a
little bit more definition by contouring
it and the the products I'll be using
for that is my illamasqua and this is my
shadow in heroin someone requested it
that I should say it like detoxed it in
RuPaul's Drag Race so the duct sculpt
them cheekbones in out in sculpting is
out right no Christina also looked very
bronzed up and warm and just really warm
and intense in those shots where she was
like yeah so to warm up my complexion
I'm gonna go with bourgeois bronzing
powder and it looks like a little
chocolate and this is coal
bronzing powder number 51 this is
actually a great
Joop for disobey by Illamasqua but
that's been brought back thanks to us so
you can't really go for either or both
and I'm just placing this on the tops of
my cheekbones so that I really get that
warm intense bronzed up feel now also
for blush I want to keep things really
warm and really sensual and bronzy so
I'm gonna go with this makeup geek blush
in bliss and also I'm gonna focus this
rather high up on the cheekbones
blending into the bronze enos and a
little bit onto the apples of the cheeks
so normally when you smell you would put
it right here no we're putting it right
here really high up then to give myself
that beautiful globe that christina was
rocking throughout this entire video I'm
gonna go with my hourglass ambient
lighting powder and this is a luminous
light and I'm just gonna put it on the
tops of my cheekbones and just oh god it
just gives you the most beautiful glow
from within look it's something that's
very pretty okay for lips you want to go
very nude and shimmery glossy so I'm
first gonna give my lips a little bit
more shoosh using my Bobbi Brown a pale
pink lip pencil just to give me a little
bit more volume there for lipstick I'm
gonna go with Illamasqua tease and then
for a lip gloss you want it to be really
glossy and shimmery and light reflective
so I'm going to go with makeup studios
lip gloss in perfectly nude and it just
has an amazing shimmer almost glitter to
it and that is exactly what I want for
today
and that guy's concludes this christina
perri inspired makeup tutorial for her
