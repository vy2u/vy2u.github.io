really cool that I actually get a iron
like a tool that was from something that
I worked on so this is my new chief that
I am so happy with it it's so pretty and
I'm just that also since I knew that if
you're going to use a flat iron that you
need some protection so Santa gave me

protection spray and I also got this
redonkulous big as silk infusion bottle
