guys so today we're going to do a
Christmas look when I think of Christmas
I think of eyeliner and bold lips
umm yes even for me Christmas is bold
lips so today on Christmas Eve I came up
with a Christmas look with a dramatic
eye liner that goes all the way to the
bottom lashline and I'm going to show
you a little trick on how you can make
your eyes look bigger on Twitter I
already posted a lot of I of the days
with this look on my eyes but with nude
lips but since it's Christmas
dark red lips with high gloss mm-hmm I'm
filming at night actually because I just
got home from UM Ikea with my mom and my
step stepdaughter
no sister-in-law they're back together
they're back together
we just went to Ikea and I got some new
lights because I was so freakin done
with the fact that I couldn't film at
night and now I can um I know I look a
little bit bluish and whitish but that's
better than just dark you know so at
least I can film at night and I can film
at night so um today we're going to do a
eyeliner Christmas look with BH
Cosmetics and which is really funny
because VH Bay hat Bay High BH is Dutch
for a bra so basically if you would
trims like this this would say bra
cosmetics earrings are from Idol tides
as well as my Cobra Cobra the thing you
guys so much for watching and if you
want to know how I did this look then
please keep on watching
okay so the first thing you want to do
is a PI baster your lists to prevent
that eyes from creasing I use this BH
Cosmetics a lip primer but let me tell
you it comes in the same container as
the Michael taught one and I actually
think it's almost the same product I
mean this is a little bit more um creamy
liquidy and this is more um I already
applied that to my eyelids and under my
eyelids as well and this tutorial we're
going to use the BH Cosmetics palette in
number three and I'm going to show you
it comes like that see I will just say
120 colors palette eyeshadow Oh BH
Cosmetics then in the back you have
holds fancy stuff and it's number three
and then you have got that it doesn't
the long and you have another layer and
we're going to use that one the first
color we're going to use is that one
so the lightest of the colorful side so
I'm going to grab a big brush like this
and I'm going to go into the lightest
color that I just showed you and this is
going on to the lid in the inner corner
and the brow bone okay so now we're
going to take the bottom layer and we're
going to take the color so we have a one
two three up and one through two three
in so grab a blending brush like this
and this is the e25 from Sigma and I'm
going to grab the color and apply that
into the crease
now is the angle brush like this going
the same color and just kind of open up
your eyes so you're going to look down
and then make a line that is under your
tear duct area like that that is
basically what you want for the trick to
make your eyes open and wing it up now
you're going to make that bottom part
really smudgy and smoky smoke you okey
this is the color we just used and we're
going to use that one and smoke it down
and mix that color with the same color
we use in the crease to make a darker so
I'm going into the black which is all
the way into the right a little
another right bottom corner and make it
nice and black
now in the inner corner take a smaller
angle brush like that and go in the same
color that we use on the lid and the
brow bone and put that on the inner
corner right here this will open up the
eyes even more okay what I'm going to do
now is grab my Mac black truck fluid
line and a angled brush like this and
we're going to line our eyes um start
really closely to your eye lashes go all
the way in
take some more
like that you see how it follows it from
that outer point of her eyeliner go back
in and then because I'm on my eyeliner
to be really nice and glossy I'm going
to grab my illamasqua precision ink and
go over it now I'm going to take a nude
eyeliner this is concealer pencil by
makeup studio and again with my lighter
melted a bit so it stays on your lid the
entire day and just a line your
waterline now it's time to curl your
lashes and apply some mascara self
reliefs we're going for like the dark
um but still bright red lips with rec
litter on top I'm gonna grab my favorite
lip brush which is the 231 by Mac and
I'm going to grab Chanel's Rouge noir
get will be my base so it's a really
dark dark red and the top of that and
right X Snow White
it's going on top and then as a gloss MX
desert glass in love alert first I take
some concealer to completely blank out
my lips and make the colors on top pop
and I'm just going to take my brush and
start off with a Rouge noir what I'm
going to do is I'm going to make my lips
look a little bit fuller so I'm actually
going to follow that white line you see
actually your lip is not the color but
it is that white line around it so I'm
just going to follow that white line
around my lip and just follow the
natural color of my bottom lip so for my
top lip I'm going to follow the light
stroke around it and here just follow
the color I'm just gonna grab some Rouge
noir and we're gonna do our thing
I just aligned them color them them in
then put the brighter red on top and and
the Glitter the bits and I'll just color
the entire thing in now I'm just going
to take some concealer and make the
edges really sharp and nice and
highlighted I love this I'm going to put
this bright red in the middle as my lip
and I'm going to grab my love alert lip
glass and put that on top
and that completes this Christmas
eyeliner look with dark red glossy
glittery lips
lung-lung title of course you don't have
to put the lipstick on that big on your
upper lip it's just that my upper lip is
way more thin than my bottom lips I
wanna um match it up a bit the eye
palette that we use today and the eye
primer I got from BH Cosmetics is
available at BH Cosmetics calm I will

my Ling which is a Cobra biting my
finger like actually it's not a joke you
