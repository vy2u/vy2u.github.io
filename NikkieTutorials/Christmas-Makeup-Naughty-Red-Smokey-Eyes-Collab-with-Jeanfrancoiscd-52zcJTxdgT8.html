Nadia look to what I told you to do a
nice look no no I'm not no I'm not II

suck anyways make sure to tune in like
right now to check how to do this
naughty yeah I said body look today me
and Jess are competing in the naughty
Christmas book he has a series every
year with the naughty or nice and he
asked me to collab with him because I
love him
and hopefully he loves me too he asked
me to be nice and I was like no I'm not
nice I don't want to be nice so we've
decided to both do a naughty look and
yeah he's gonna do a cut crease green
dialogue and I'm gonna do this a red
smokey dramatic eye which you can wear
to the clubs or to a rock concert or
Christmas being naughty so thank you
guys so much for watching and onto the
naughty tutorials
okay so the first thing you want to do
is keep JSS because he sucks no but the
first thing you want to do is apply a
base to your lips to prevent your ISIL
creasing now you want to apply a second
base to rule it which is a black base
and that is to make the colors on top
pop I'm going to use a makeup studio
cream eyeliner in black so I'm going to
grab a synthetic brush like this and
apply the creamy eyeliner with it
now I'm going to grab max heritage Rouge
pigment which is a dark shimmering red
and with a 239 I'm gonna apply that to
my list make sure to pet it on not swipe
because then you will get fallout
now I'm going to grab eight Sigma 217
which is a little bit fuller and thicker
than the next 217 and I'm just going to
go into Heritage Rouge again and you're
going to blend that into your crease and
up go up go up go up go up
now I'm going to grab a Sigma 275 and
vanilla because that's not my baby and
I'm going to highlight my brow brow bone
and then for some extra shimmer I'm
gonna grab this Mac mineralize eyeshadow
trio in love to does and I'm gonna grab
that light highlight color and that's
going on top now I'm going to intensify
my crease a little bit more and I'm
grabbing the Mac 217 and I'm going into
a matte black I'm using the black right
there and I'm just gonna darken up the
crease and the outer V okay for the
lower part of the eyes it's going to be
really intense in black I'm gonna grab a
stick my shorts shader brush in e 20 and
I'm going into the black color and just
really smoke out that lower lash line
then I'm going to grab a Sigma 239 and
I'm going to go into M bark and with the
tip of the bristles I'm gonna smoke down
the lower lash line I'm gonna grab that
275 is Sigma again and I'm going to grab
a vanilla and the love to love highlight
color and that is going on you inner
corner it's just a bit then I want this
outer part to be really sharp so I'm
gonna grab a concealer brush also by
Sigma and a concealer and then just make
a really sharp line and grab a face
powder to set it with so it doesn't move
okay now I'm going to use a nude
eyeliner on my waterline I'm going to
use makeup studio concealer pencil and
because I like my eye line needs to be a
little bit creamy when I apply it I'm
gonna melt it with a plain mascara now
I'm going to use my makeup studio
water-resistant volume mascara this is
the new mascara from makeup studio and I
love it um I'm gonna do that right now
and then I'm going to show you how to
get really nude lips like I always am
and then we're done so the thing is I
either get my Mac lip erase or a
concealer to start with and then I apply
a lipstick and then I'm done I'm going
to take my NC fist
I'm going to take my nc15 Pro Longwear
concealer by Mac and I'm going to
conceal my lips it's I'm just gonna tone
it down a bit because this is like white
and then I'm gonna grab a nice lipstick
to complete the look today's lipstick
