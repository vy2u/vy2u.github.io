for Sierra lovesick some magic with
Justin Timberlake
um this music video is amazing I love
her body I love how she's licking
Justin's ear and a lot her makeup and I
was like so today I did a look mostly we
created by it but of course she has a
darker skin tone and I have she um I
don't know what they use exactly so this
is just my interpretation of it um so
yeah don't kill me if I'm not totally
right I hope you guys like this if you
want to know how I did this then please
keep on watching
so the first thing I want to do is apply
a base to your eyelet and under your eye
to protect your eyes from creasing
I used my Catrice um stay on a shadow
base and then I am trying this new
product and it is new by Michael Todd
and August medical Telecom is selling
this and it is in the car nude and um
yeah I'm just gonna take that with my
ring finger and I'm going to apply that
all over my lid as well as a second base
normally I would take my painterly Paint
Pot by Mac but as you can see I'm
testing this out for a few days to see
if it is better or or nicer in use so I
will definitely keep you guys updated on
this one so the first thing you want to
do is take max copper plate with a sigma
wing the side bar bottom bar with the
224 go in the copper plate and apply it
is into the crease yes
now I'm going to take max pigment in
sweet Sienna really nice pigment really
nice with a 213 on my Mac and I'm
getting some onto the brush and then go
into the lid to stamp it into the brush
Stephanie exits off and then apply it
all over the lid now take max vanilla my
favorite color and with a 275 by Sigma
apply this to your brow bone
and normally I would apply all the way
here but right now I'm not doing that
because I do want to open up my eyes
with the light color in my tear duct but
not so heavy so where your tear duct is
just push it right there just right
where your to about this the next color
I'm going to take is Mac's signed sealed
and with a pencil brush like this one
I'm going to smudge just along my upper
lashes and what you want to do is you
make it you want to make it more thick
on the outer corners and when you go in
it should end up really thin just like
eyeliner but a little bit more dramatic
so I'm going to start with the outer
corner like that and then I'm going to
take it in be careful
like that and then on the outer corners
you're going to wing it a bit just a bit
and then blend it into the crease
oh oh you see you don't want that that's
way too much now what you can do to make
this alright again is take your ring
finger and blend it out a bit and just
work with it
and then if it's still too much you can
just take a blending brush and blend it
out even more now I'm going to take on
sugarpill cosmetics pigment in tiara and
you really just do not want a lot of
this you just want a little bit of
glitter out of the penguin so I'm going
to take the lid and the lid has like
minimum amount of product so I'm going
to dip my brush into it and then I have
like a really teeny teeny bit and that
is going over to sweet Sienna for some
extra sparkle for the lower lid it's so
freakin easy you're just going to take
signed sealed and apply it up from here
seal here and then going to take sweet
sienna and put that on the inner corners
for a nice smoky touch I'm going to do
is tight line my waterline right here
and make my waterline on the down but
I'm not going to do is align my eyes
with Rimmel London's glam eyes
professional liquid eyeliner you want to
make you want to make it kind of thick
and winged out um do I have a tutorial
that no I will make a tutorial on how I
do winged eyeliner and cat eyes really
soon and then you wanna make your
waterline black and tight line this also
it is black in there too so I'm gonna do
all that right now then I'm going to
show you what is on my lips and then we
will do the outro and then the intro
no we will say hi so that completes the
look on my lips it is so much fun
because the love nudes and tiara where
needs to as I was like I love you girl
but I started off with is this new
product by Michael Todd once again a
Michael top product link is in the
button bar for where you can get it um
and this is a nude lip base so you take
this apply to your lips and they're
completely blanked out and then you can
put any new lipstick new gloss on top to
make the colors really pop what you can
do too is use this as a base and if you
have like the brightest brightest
brightest pink lipstick this will pop
like hell on top of this so this is
great for getting new lips but for
making bright colors pop as well so I
really recommend getting this this even
was too new for me so I took some
Catrice a new sensation soft coral
lipstick this is probably my favorite
lipstick I don't know why Catrice made
this limited edition because I want it
and this is my last one and then to give
it a little bit more of a pink touch I
took next Viva Glam Lady Gaga and put
that on top for a nice soft pink touch
so this is all my legs that completes
this Sahara
I'm 11:6 the magic oh look umm I hope
you like it it is not really the same as
her because of course she has a darker
skin tone than I have
and I don't know what she used exactly
but if I was like the white sister with
Justin and Sierra and I was like in the
middle of oh like that I will look like
this probably right
thank you guys so much for watching I
cannot wait to see your responses it is

vigor response in the video response

much for watching I will talk to you
