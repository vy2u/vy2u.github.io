clothing sort of type video haul thing I
am in the hallway of my house or not my
house but our family's house today I'm
going to show you some items of clothing
items that I got recently for summer
however my collection is like 70% black
because I always have to wear black with
my work when I go to shoot or something
and I just really really like black on
me right now
wearing black again so I wanted to film
this in my room but it's actually really
really hot outside and I really feels
like the material
Falls right now so that's not going to
happen a little disclaimer I'm no
stylist I'm no fashion expert I'm really
just getting into clothes because I
start to love clothes more and more so
these are just some things that I like
when it's together I do not wear any
heels because I'm 6 foot to 1 meter and
97 years so I'm tall as it's like a door

wondering why I don't wear heels with
these outfits I was going to film some
commentary and show you the pieces live
and then as a layover I did the outfits
but as I said it's too damn hot in my
room so I'm not going to do that I am
actually just gonna show you the outfits
now and I'm just going to do a voice
over and I cringe at voiceovers but for
this video only I'm going to do a voice
over because it's too hot in here and I
will just tell you where the clothes are
from so if you want to see my new summer
