know that because I'm not really like a
big star with like clothes and stuff I'm
not really that good with clothes I just

gonna show you I made I guess I think I
made um I made three outfits because I
bought like three outfits today before
yesterday and I'm going to show you them
the lighting is a little bit sucky
because it's in my mom's room yet so
let's go right ahead to the ethics I got
new jeans new jeans let me zoom in these
are some skinny denim leggings I want to
show you
the back that are my legs then on top I
got a basic like just a basic t-shirt
and then with this um necklace this is
my favorite necklace is like a key it's
so pretty and then I bought this vest
and I am in love with this vest because
um it was only twelve year old and I
know I really really like it it's just I
like it so um I paired it up with some
yeah accessorize and stuff so this is
outfit number one just a really casual
basic style with skinny leggings and a
vest so often number one contained like
three things or like without the
acessories I bought this on like denim
leggings from UM Vero Moda I don't think
they have it in the States we have it
here in the nollans is a really cool
store it's like hmm but a little bit I
don't know a little bit different and
they have I am really tall as you guys
know I'm like one meter and 90
centimeters and um this hike sticks to
or something and um I need long up jeans
basically these were like 27 euros which
is good for jeans really good actually
then I paired it with like that black
t-shirt you saw that is this one right
here I read that all the time in my
videos it's so comfy I got that from H&amp;amp;M
it was like well euros I have that so
long already and then on top I have this
vest and as you can see in the clip it's
this vest and it was only 13 euros and
it's from Sena haha oh my god she's out

the next pair I got is some pair of kind
of sort of hot pants shorts these are by
H&amp;amp;M and um let me zoom in they look like
that

H&amp;amp;M - this is like a beautiful love
taupe color um and this was five year
old for the last outfit I got this um

and I for this dress this is a
beautiful peachy pinky color um I got
this at Vera Moda as well this was 17
euros and the leggings um I have them so

makeup is like here in my book and
clothes are right here
and here here that is basically for
clothes I showed you if you want to see
this more often tell me I felt really
uncomfortable like I don't know it's
