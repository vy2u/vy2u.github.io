so for foundation today we're going to
use Cavan Dee's Lockett tattoos
foundation which is all over the bottle
and then first I'm going to dab some
foundation on with a brush and we're
going to lay it on first and then blend
it in with a with my sponge
put the concealer and that mute out any
darkness and then I'm also going to
highlight the rest of her face with that
sponge we're going to buff that in make
it seamless so now I'm just quickly
going to powder her face and do her
brows really naturally off-camera and
then we will be yeah and we're both so
now we're going to go on to eyes already
went ahead and did one super party glam
so first I'm going to go in with a soft
ochre Paint Pot to prime and fine now
with a bone colored eyeshadow I'm going
to apply this from crease to brow bone
just as a transition and this will help
blending all the colors later on so much
easier now I'm going to go in with my
35o palette by morphe and if you use
discount code Nikki you'll get some dull
was all I'm just going to use a couple
of these colors right here and I'm going
to start with these two right here in
the crease first I'm going to define
Sharon's crease very softly adding some
more
again I'm going to apply a darker Brown
in the outer V and I'm going to use this
right here as a guide to create a nice
clean line and then I'm going to start
blending this in the crease and onto the
lash line just make it nice soft and
slow
now with a beautiful dark brownish shiny
color from the 35o palette I'm going to
apply this to Sharon's lids to add the
smoky touch and with this color right
here by hot makeup this is called the
hot candy eyeshadow in Morocco this is
going right over top and lastly with a
nice peachy shimmery color I'm applying
that to the inner third of Sharon's lids
frumpy Natasha de Nona eyeshadow palette
I'm going to take this a color here so
pretty I know and that it's going on the
center of Xillia do now we're going to
focus on the lower lash line so I'm just
going to use the same Browns as we
applied in the crease on the lower lash
line and just take it
and then we're going to connect the
outer corner to the crease right here
make it one cohesive look now from being
etosha banana I should have held I'm
going to take these two right here and
that is going on the inner corners of
the lower lash line get that party look
going I'm going to highlight the inner
corners using cream - Hacha de Nonna now
I'm going to intensify the look using
some black we're going to add the
glitter to top and bottom this is mythic
cowboy by Urban Decay my favorite and
this is going on the inner portion so
almost as if it looks wet and then look
up for me darling and then also in the
inner corners
