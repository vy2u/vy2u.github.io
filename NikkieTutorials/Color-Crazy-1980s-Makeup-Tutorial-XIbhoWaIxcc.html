I'm going to do a 1980s inspired makeup
look it's very color crazy we're going
all out with like the the typical
eighties contouring and just the colors
and just the entire feel and just I am
feeling this today so this video is a
part of the makeup throughout the ages
collab with me and Shannon so and Chloe
Morello and Sharon Frye El Chapo's Jose
de Karima koreff into tor tacky and of
course that's makeup and I believe I
believe that's it so Sharon from Sharon
Pharrell invited us all to be a part of
this amazing collab and a couple of
weeks ago she did a video where she took
some names and eras so two 20s the 30s
the 40s 50s go on and on so everyone got
their era and then they had to film a
tutorial inspired by that era so I guess
you can tell that I got the 80s so yeah
if you're ready to get 80s color crazy
today on my channel then please keep on
watching priming your eyelids for this
look is key because you want your colors
to pop and I'm using my Mac soft ochre
Paint Pot for this the first I should
I'll be using is Anya by Illamasqua
and I'm going to take it I'm going to
take that on yeah and I'm applying the
shade all over my eyelid now going in a
little bit of makeup geeks wisteria and
I'm going to start off by applying this
right in my crease using windshield
wiper motions and I'm going all the way
in with this one now mixing that in with
a little bit of sugar pills poison plum
and I'm really going to start building
definition on the inside of my eye so
just take a bigger brush and start going
up to your brow point the beginning
point into your nose line and with this
look what you want to remember is a let
loose just go with it okay and then what
I'm going to do is flick it in to the
beginning of my brow and sort of
blending it out here and that's taking a
more concentrated brush I'm going to
make a line to the bridge of my nose and
what this will do is really make that
inner part of the eyes
sink in and give that really grungy look
and this is an 80s classic where they
really go onto the bridge of the nose
and really bring all that sort of
attention there okay now going back into
the purple shades and I'm going to place
that on the inner third of my eye
blending in with the Anya color by
Illamasqua and also placing it right
here on the outer third then going back
in with a little bit more Aine and Arion
that color to make it more vivid and
blend it with the purple for my yellow
I'll be using my sugarpill Shibu butter
cupcake and really lightly you want to
place it next to the purple ride on your
nose line and then flick it up and this
to just add a little bit of yellow there
because almost every 80s look includes a
little bit of yellow so I'm doing that
too I'm having way too much fun with
this okay now I'm gonna take one of
these Inglot colors I'm gonna take this
sort of peachy orange color right there
and with this I'm going to start
blending this part of the purple and I'm
really touching my brow with it as well
so you don't want a gap of of
nothingness here so really put it in
there and then just kind of blend that
out and diffuse it out and give that a
nice pop of peachy coral for my lower
lash line I'm just reapply the poison
plum by sugarpill and go all the way in
with this and to really give it that 80s
feel you want to go down with this don't
be afraid let loose loose of all the the
you know the safety cords let go and
with that I'm also going to change the
shape of the look a bit I'm going to
make it more blown out and more in like
sort of a triangle so I'm going to take
a bigger brush and start whooping this
out to the corner now taking the pink
color from that Inglot palette and you
guessed it with this on going down onto
my eye area here on the outer part to
really give that blown-out 80s feeling
now with a little bit of white I'm gonna
highlight my inner corners and this is
Illamasqua sex on the beach now taking
the bums mary-lou manizer to highlights
I'm going to highlight right here on my
brow bone and then wipe your brush house
and start blending that highlight in
with the pink and the purple and then
also load it up on the inner corners
quickly opening up my eyes with my Ben
Nye neutralizer cream crayon in ultra
light I know it's time for mascara and
lashes so for mascara I'll be using my
makeup studio water / 3d in extra black
X lorac every lashes I'll be using my
Miss adoro number 43 so onto the cheeks
and for cheeks in the 80s it was all
about contouring with color and rosy
shades and coral peachy shades and just
blown out and big if we thought Kim
Kardashian was the queen of contouring
right now she got nothing back in the
80s so first to get myself going I will
take my Illamasqua eyeshadow in heroine
to sort of carve out where I want all
the contours to be so I'm just gonna
take a bit and I'm just gonna start
cutting the cheek here also go ahead and
do your temples because they did not
skip the temples now to give myself that
sort of pinky peachy hue of the color of
a shade of a contour I'm gonna take my
bubby Brown pink coral blush one of my
favorite from that contour buff set in
so I placed it on my contour line and I
buff it in and out and you mainly want
to keep all the blush at the sides sort
at the back of your face and now on the
apples and again go on to the temples
and add some warmth there and what's
always nice for 80s makeup is to go from
your sort of eye and flick it into the
temple with your blush so your
I becomes a temple shape thing it's
amazing something they did not do in the
80s is highlight with a shimmer product
on the face to give yourself that glowy
feeling that is something more of now so
to make this a little bit more modern
and a little bit more you know a little
bit of juzu I'm gonna take my the ball
mary lou manizer again and I'm going to
highlight really lightly on the highest
points of my cheeks and right above the
arch of my brow so again if you want to
stay super super true to the 80s don't
do this because they did not use
highlighters like shiny highlighter and
also while Mehta just you know screw the
rules highlight your notes and your
Cupid's bow but when I make it a little
bit more modern free lips there's a lot
of things you can do you can go for like
a neon pink you can go for like a true
red you could go for a nude gloss I'm
going to go all out I'm gonna go for
orange because I love orange with purple
and blue and just this I like orange
with this so for my lipstick I'll be
using my Mac old it mix in orange one of
my favorite and then as a gloss because
I noticed a lot of colors to be either
high gloss or super mattes I'm going for
the lip tar stained gloss in and your
gin and these two together makes such a
killer combo I've used this on so many
photo shoots and every time it's a win
so this is going on my lips okay let's
get crackin
