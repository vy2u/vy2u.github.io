on this sort of goth is MP look what I
do that I was bold so today I'm going to
do this colored goth look I've been
wanting to do something extreme for
weeks now because I've been doing really
wearable looks lately and I'm kind of
done with that so today I'm going
to show you how to do this this is the
first time that I'm filming with my new
canon 600d so it's kind of a mess
this entire tutorial because one I have
to find the right lighting I have to
stay in focus I shouldn't move because
then I go out of focus and it's sort of
hard so I hope that all is clear if not
you can leave any questions in the
comment box below also I made a official
unofficial Facebook page for any
tutorials it is right here and the link
is below as well other than that me and
my goth book right now are done and I
hope you enjoy this video and yeah let's
go ok so the first thing I'm going to do
is apply a base to my eyelids to prevent
the eyeshadow from creasing and the one
I'm using is my self ochre Paint Pot
from Mac now I'm going to take this
Urban Decay slide-on shadow pencil and
deling Quinns and I'm going to start
making a base with this on my eye so I'm
just going to make the basic shape of
this craziness now I'm going to look
straight into a mirror right below the
camera and I'm going to draw my crease
into this and I'm going to make a really
extreme and go up as hell because we're
going to go goth and we want to go big
and we go dark and go into the inner
corners here as well I'm going to take a
blending brush and blend it out even
more now I'm going to take sugar pills
poison plum and Max the shadowing lady
right here and I'm just going to apply
that everywhere where the pencil is as
well just to give it that really nice
base purpley color
now I'm going to take max quark my
favorite mac eye shadow and I'm just
going to take that on a really big
blending brush and I'm just going to
blend some darkness into the nose line
right here and that will really give
that grungy feeling then I'm going to
take poison plum again and blend this
baby boy up now I'm going to take this
NYX pencil in dark brown and I'm going
to apply that all over my lid
okay now blend that out into the purple
and into the crease okay and then I'm
going to go on top with Mac's club
eyeshadow and mix blue brown pigments
and just apply that on top of the dark
brown and blend it into the crease now
I'm going to take shadowy lady alone and
I'm going to darken this entire look out
the biggest right now it's a little bit
too colorful and not too dark and Gotha
SHhhh
so I'm just going to take shadowy lady
and darken the crease up and darken this
inner corner of just to really make it
nice and grungy and uh I'm also going to
apply some club and blue brown pigment
onto the lower lashes as well then I'm
going to take this color by my called
light fall and I'm going to apply that
as a brow bone highlight now I'm going
to blend poison plum all the way to the
inner corners and then I'm going to take
my favorite silver shimmer this is
makeup studios jewel effects in shine
and I'm going to apply that right here
on the inner corners
but I'm not going to do is apply a black
eye goal to my waterline so really make
it really dark and uh then I'm going to
apply some mascara to my bottom and top
lashes for my top lashes I'm going to
use illamasqua must gara and raisin and
for the lower lashes this Clinique
bottom lash mascara so I'll be right
back I'm gonna take this blush from Mac
and this is called pinch o peach and I'm
actually going to apply that like a halo
like a glow around my cheekbone so
really on top of the cheekbones I'm
going to apply this and don't really go
to the apples of your cheeks because
then it will look too cute and you
really want to make it a nice glow like
around the eyes and because with these
editorial goth looks I really love to
give it some shine now and then for that
I'm going to use Mac's the nila pigment
and this is absolutely gorgeous and I'm
just going to pop that on top of my
cheekbones oh it's gorgeous for the lips
ah you can keep them really nude and
make them like a little bit depth
looking that is sort of what is really
nice with these eyes I really do like
that but I wanted to go all the way out
because I've been doing these boring as
safe' looks lately I'm going to go all
out and what I'm going to do is I am
going to apply dark red lips net red
lips and I'm going to apply current lip
pencil from Mac which is a really nice
dark dark red and then on top I'm going
to go with number eight why is Dell a
Rouge pocket or in in number eight this
is a really nice dark dark red and then
depending on my mood if that still isn't
red enough or dark enough I'm going to
go a little bit on top with mix Prince
noir which is almost a black
you
so yeah guys that completes this colored
goth I inspired look I know this is not
going to be wearable for most of us on
this planet but I just wanted to go out
once again so yes I think you guys so
