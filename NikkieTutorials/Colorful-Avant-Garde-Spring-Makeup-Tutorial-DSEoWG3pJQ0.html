this really colorful I like to call this
my extreme avant-garde a spring look I
haven't played with color for so long
which is weird because I love colors and
glitter and stuff so today I came up
with this and if you want to know how I
did this then please keep on watching
so the first thing you want to do is
apply a base to prevent the eyeshadow
for creasing as I say in every every
single video the one I'm using is soft
ochre by neck and it looks like the I
can't support the eyes I'm gonna take my
eggs jumbo pencil in milk and this is
just a white creamy base I'm just gonna
put that onto my lid just a really tiny
bit because if you apply this too much
it's gonna crease because it's such a
creamy product I'm just gonna take my
finger and blend that into the lid now
I'm going to take Ilima scuzz eyeshadow
in Anya and this is just this is insane
Anya is going on to the lid and thanks
to that NYX jumbo pencil of milk it's
really gonna stick to the lid Plus
because the demo pencil milk is white is
really gonna pop on the lid any color
that you put on a white face is gonna
pop like crazy
now I'm gonna take max a velvet moss and
several lemon and I'm gonna make a
mixture between the two and apply those
to my crease so I'm gonna start off with
a velvet moss first and I'm just gonna
cut the crease with it
and now with sour lemon only I'm going
to blend this boy up and you really need
to take your time with blending this
because that is going to take you the
longest time with this look it all needs
to be blended as hell now I'm going to
make a mix of sugar pills butter cupcake
Mac's goldenrod and sour lemon again and
that's just gonna be my blending color
for above the entire lot I'm just going
to keep mixing those three colors and
then blending up
okay now going back into velvet moth and
sour lemon and you guessed it you're
gonna blend the dark green up as well
into the lighter colors because right
now it's just more of a stripe or like a
line and you want it to be this nice
blended line
and all you want to do is just keep
blending it just keep taking colors of
the color palette that you have and keep
adding one color and then blending the
other color in it's all about adding and
matching and blending and just working
with it
until you have something that you like
not gonna take velvet Mouse
only two darker green color and I'm
going to line this bit right there
to make it one big cut it crease and
then from the point I'm gonna make a
wing just to make the eyelashes look a
little bit fuller and thicker and of
course you want to blend it out Fred
above I'm gonna make some X out Trey oh
okay and mix golden rod and then it's
gonna give that really nice ochre ish
orange color I love that color I'm going
to just put it on the lower lash line
you're gonna meet it with the rest of
the crease right there gonna blend it
out a bit because I don't want it to be
too harsh and I added a little bit of
butter cupcake the sugar pill color on
this brush as well to give it a little
bit more than yellow twist now I'm gonna
take this gorgeous
lorac 3d liquid lustre this is one of
the most gorgeous products I own so I'm
just gonna take a brush and pop that as
a inner corner glitter highlight and
then what I like to do to make the eyes
look a little bit bigger is take the out
tray or the or the color whatever that
warm ochre color and go underneath the
shine the inner corner highlight and
that will make the eyes appear bigger
for my waterline I'm gonna take this
benign neutralizer cream crayon okay now
I'm just gonna curl my lashes with my
schumer eyelash curler and apply two
mascara on my top lashes I'm gonna apply
makeup Studios waterproof 3d weather of
extra black mascara
I bet stuff um and on the bottom I'm
going to use makeup studios 4d extra
black false lash effect mascara
okay for lips it's all up to you what
you want to do because I want to keep
this a really nice avantgarde spring
look I'm going to Python soft pink lips
I'm first gonna pencil my lips in with
Nyx's dolly pink lipliner this is great
and then on top for a little bit of
shine and just a little bit of lip look
let's that cuz this Saint Germain by Mac
which is it's really shocking in a tube
and I'm just gonna Pat it over the lip
pencil so that is just what I'm gonna do
right now really self-explanatory
so yeah
so yeah guys that completes this
avant-garde extreme spring look I love
this I haven't done colors in a while

love colors so yeah I hope you guys
