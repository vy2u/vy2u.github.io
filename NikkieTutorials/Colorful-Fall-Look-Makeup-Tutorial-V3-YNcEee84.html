colorful fall look I was super duper
inspired by New York Fashion Week with
all the extreme looks there was one show
where the models had a really colorful
smoky eye and I was like I got to do
that with my colors so today I am going
to do a somewhat dramatic smoky look I
love the colors and the smokiness and I
just I love this so if you want to know
how to get these extreme colorful smokey
eyes for fall then please keep on
watching so the first thing I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna take this paint pot called
quite natural and I'm going to put this
on my lid and then blend it up into my
crease okay so the first itno we'll be
using is this mac eyeshadow duo in mache
appuse and I'm gonna start from the
bottom making the direction of my shape
and then go out then from that point go
into your crease fill that in and now
I'm going to blend this out and just
keep on blending that until it looks
soft
but edgy I'm applying that same color to
the inner part of my lid going up to the
first half of my iris and also the outer
half now I'm going to take this OCC
pigment called cherry bomb and this is
going on the middle of my lid sort of
the width of my iris and then of course
blend it out and I'm also gonna run a
bit of that color on my nose line right
here on the inner part this will give it
that amazing fashion touch and then make
sure to really really blend that out and
make it soft and a little bit more
wearable than right now and then I'm
going to make the rest of my crease a
little bit more extreme as well with
that same shadow that we've been using
all along
ma che mal she Oh peace
okay I'm not running some quite natural
Paint Pot on my lower lid as well and
I'm gonna set that with the same Akshay
Oh boosts eyeshadow duo by Mac the
darker color
I'm gonna run some of that OCC pigment
the pink one on my bottom lid as well
and sort of the same width as on top and
then blend that out again then for my
inner corner I'm using the same neck i
shadow duo but now taking the gold
bronze color and I'm putting that on my
inner corners and I'm not being shy and
I'm going all the way in don't be afraid
I'll take care of you every first time
is scary but you will be fine oh my god
no virgin touch your inner corner for
the very first time now I'm gonna take
Nyx's slide on pencil in jet black and
this is going on my waterline and then
I'm putting some on my actual lid as
well because we're gonna blend that out
later on it was later on I mean right
now just blend that black a little bit
more onto your lower lid as well
and also a little bit at your top lashes
okay now I'm gonna curl my lashes with
my schumer eyelash curler and then for
mascara I'm gonna use two this is the
makeup studio waterproof 3d extra black
um mascara and then to separate my
lashes a little bit more I'm gonna use
the makeup studio mascara in ultimate
curl and I've been really digging this
lately to really separate my lashes and
make them look okay so for cheeks I'm
first gonna contour with my NYX blush in
taupe and I love me a strong contour so
I'm gonna do that
then I'm really going to warm up the
tops of my cheekbones with my Illamasqua
blush in disobey and I'm not really
using it as a blush but more right here
really high up and more in the back and
as a highlight I'm using Mac soft and
gentle mineralized skinfinish of your
firm ellipse I'm going to keep it really
really simple I want to keep it nude
because I love really fierce smoky Eisen
and almost no lips so I'm just using my
foundation brush and any foundation that
is left in it is going over my lips and
on top I'm going to apply a little bit
of Kat Von D's lipstick in Agatha and
then with my fingers I'm really gonna
blend that in and then guys completes my
colorful sort of extreme fall look I
really really like this I was so
inspired by a New York Fashion Week and
just fall hitting us fall is hitting us
when you say fall is hitting us don't
you just see like a couple of leaves

my imagination so figure guys so much
