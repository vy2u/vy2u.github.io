tutorial that you know I don't even know
how this happened I was going through
some of my inspiration pictures on my
iPhone and then I came across this
really vintage sort of Barbie look and
then also a pinup II look and I decided
to sort of match the two together and I
came up with this I would like to call
this a modern colorful pinup makeup
tutorial it includes color it includes
that modern twist of like darker heavier
brows and just the super matte lips and
a shiny skin and I love this look if you
want to know how to get this a modern
colorful pinup makeup look then please
keep on watching ok so I already applied
a base and for that I use my Mac soft
ochre Paint Pot and I'll be taking this
design pro xstream color art and this is
baby blue and I will be using this as my
base and you of course have to activate
that with some water ok and then the
first thing I'm going to do is sort of
map out my shape and what I'm going for
is the look of a really blown up a big
eyeliner say kind of want to see it as
if you wanted a double winged liner so a
black one and a blue one but the blue
one got blown out and became the shape
following your crease and in sort of
giving that eye line your flick at the
end so well you first want to do is make
a line to give it that eyeliner feeling
and then trace it a little bit above
your crease and then make it an entire
solid shape I take another brush and
with this I kind of map out where I want
my crease to be and how high I want my
crease to be sort of map out the shape
and I definitely want it really rounded
here at the inner corner as you can see
I made it quite round it there so you
want to follow that
and as I'm doing all these steps I just
keep looking back and forth to the left
side and the right side to see if the
height is the same because you do want
these to be exactly the same and
symmetrical I take a little bit more of
the baby blue extreme color art and I
just follow it throughout my crease and
then you kind of want to take it
straight if of that line that you made
first and then give it a nice wing and
once they match you just want to fill in
the entire space
okay I'm looking down because I don't
want this to crease um so I might look a
little bit awkward but what you now want
to do is just let this dry for a bit to
set it and give it some more vibrancy
I'm gonna take Illamasqua eyeshadow in
Anya and just set that extreme color art
by design Pro with this to highlight my
inner corners I'll be using this the
bomb over shadow pigment in no money no
honey and I'm applying this right here
on this very inner corner and then
blending up a bit not too much but just
a little bit and then also a little bit
right here very close to the tear duct
area and blending inwards and then with
a concealer brush I'm just going to tame
that a bit because right now it's quite
a lot and quite a lot of pigment has
fallen down onto this part right here
and I'm just going to kind of tame that
a bit and control that on the waterline
I will be applying some Ben Nye
neutralizer cream crayon in ultra light
and that's your grab the look more and
give it a little bit more of the pinup
you feeling I'm gonna add a thin line of
black eyeliner everyone will be using my
Makeup Forever aqua liner in number 13
which is black
okay now with a waterproof black pencil
on just got a tight line my eyes just to
have like no gaps of skin peeking
through the liner okay now we applying
some mascara to my top lashes only this
is makeup city waterproof 3d extra black
and I'm also going to apply some lashes
and these are the Mac 36 okay then it's
a fun finishing touch I'll be taking
this Illamasqua precision ink and scribe
and I'm going to apply a trick that I
picked up from raisin from RuPaul's Drag
Race and that is placed to white
tiny dots on the inner parts of the eyes
and that will really open up your eyes
and give it a more cartoony feel so
literally all you want to do is take
that white eyeliner and just place a dot
on the very inner corner of your eyes
okay so for cheeks I already did some
contouring and for that it gives my NYX
blush in taupe then to give my face a
little bit more warmth I'm going to take
my LM Eska blush in disobey and where I
would normally slap on the bitch load I
will just now keep it really tamed
and soft therefore blush I'm going to
make a mixture between Mac's launch away
and NARS Gina and I'm applying the blush
in a C shape around my eyes so I'm
applying it to my temples here but also
here right next to my eye and right onto
the top of the cheek and I don't know if
you can tell that it just gives the
slightest bit of color to the face
without looking too obvious and without
looking like oh my gosh you got blush in
her face no it just it just gives color
but it keeps it fun and playful and
youthful so do that again to the other
side and of course you want to highlight
I mean who doesn't want to look like
glowy princess pin-up glow be princess
pinup pin the princess Chloe F Renetta
will be using my Mac extra dimension
eyeshadow in a natural flirt and this
goes right here on the tops of the
cheekbone is sort of on the the Apple as
well to give you a nice shiny glow so
again other side right here top of the
cheekbones
and then sort of blending it onto the
Apple to give you a nice Sheen when you
smell okay fur lips it's actually quite
what you want to do yourself
of course because I'm gonna stick to the
entire pinup modern colorful pinup stick
I'm gonna go for a bright red lip but
you can also just go for a nude color
just line your lips to give yourself a
little bit more fullness and volume and
then just a new color that will look
stunning as well so the colors I will be
using are my Mac lip mix in crimson and
my RiRi whoo let me show you RiRi whoo
lipstick
