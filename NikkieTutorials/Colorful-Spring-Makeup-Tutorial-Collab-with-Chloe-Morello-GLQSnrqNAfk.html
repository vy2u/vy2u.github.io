collab with Chloe Morello we did one for
summer winter because Chloe lives in
Australia and right there it's fall now
and in here in Holland it's spring so
after we did the winter summer one we
got so many positive reactions and we
loved collaborating with each other so
we decided to do it again so I came up
with this really bright green yellow and
purple eye it is definitely out there it
is right for me this screams spring and
Chloe did this amazing sexy smoky look
and I absolutely love it on her
absolutely go check out Chloe's channel
and her video for this collab and I will
put all the links in the info box down
below plus you could just click on the
pictures that I showed you see I don't
forget to show Chloe some love because I
love Chloe and without any further ado
let's go on to this crazy spring look so
the first thing you want to do is apply
base your eyelids to prevent action for
creasing and I used my Mac soft ochre
paper for my first I should I'll be
using this Inglot grass green color
Inglot eye shadows from my number so I
do not know the exact number combination
from the top of my head but I will put
that combination on my blog and
nikkietutorials calm and what I'm gonna
do with the color is first apply to the
outer half of my crease and i'm also
gonna swoop it down onto the lid a
little bit more and onto the outer
corners here for MINIX i shall be taking
a yellow and this is by sugarpill called
butter cupcake and this is going on to
the inner part of the crease and
blending it into that grass green color
and then with the bigger blending brush
i'm gonna go into that yellow and start
diffusing the edges you can use the
green for this to diffuse it out but i
find the the yellow to work a little bit
better and be a little bit prettier than
the green now reapplying some of the
green to intensify it a lot more for the
lid oh when i bright oh I like how
and I'm gonna mix two shadows for that
the first color is by Illamasqua and
this is called sex and the second action
that we'll be using is by sugarpill and
this is called poison plum and just
start defining your lower lashline with
this and I'm gonna go quite low with
this because I love how farther you go
down with your eyeshadows on the bottom
lashline
the smokier and more playful it gets so
I'm gonna drag it down a little bit and
then I'm gonna go and take that green
again
and connect that to the lilac color and
sort of make this entire shape work for
the lid I'm gonna take a pressed pigment
by Mac called a light touch I can't open
it because it's loose inside I broke it
and for a dash of shining glitter that
is going on to the lid okay now it's
time for some eyeliner and for that I'll
be taking the color star liquid eyeliner
in number 24 and I'm just gonna make a
sick luscious winged eyeliner with that
I'm the Weber line I'm applying a bit of
Ben Nyes neutralizer cream crayon in
ultra light and I'm now highlighting my
inner corners using my favorite
highlighter shade for that and - my D
lorac unzipped palette and the shadow is
called undercover it's now time for some
mascara and I'm using my makeup Cydia
what a / 3d extra black and for lashes
I'm going to use my favourites and these
are the Mac 36 so for the cheeks I
already went ahead and did some
contouring using my Illamasqua eyeshadow
in heroine and now I'm going to warm up
my face a little bit more using my
illamasqua blush in disobey no brought
back from the dead yet from Illamasqua
so keep on tweeting safe disobey for
Nicki and us and tag me in illamasqua in
it we need to save disobeyed we have to
then for blush I'm going to make a
mixture between these two this is Max's
alia blossom blush ombre and this is
benefits curly stuff which smells
divinely amazing you should know and of
course my face isn't finished with that
a little bit of glow and for that I'm
using my Mac a natural flirt extra
dimension eyeshadow and you know it by
now highest points of the face
so Frank the lips were going to keep
everything really nude and and lay down
and pretty and just not too much color
because do I have to say anymore some
fur is aligning my lips and giving them
a little bit more fullness using my
stripped down the pencil bag back and
then for a lipstick I'm gonna go for hue
by Mac and then I stop a little bit of
Mac's lip gloss in talk softly to me
so that guy's completes my look for the
spring fall collab with Chloe Morello
