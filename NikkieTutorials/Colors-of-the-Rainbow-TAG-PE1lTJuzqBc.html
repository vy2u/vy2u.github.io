colors of the rainbow tag and I'm
basically one of the last gurus here on
YouTube blend who hasn't done it yet so
um today I'm here to do the colors of
the rainbow tag as I said basically
every guru has done it by now and it
kind of breaks my heart that nobody no
buddy no one of you guys tagged me
something's got to change here it
doesn't matter how many times I let a
like kinda drop the hint of like I'm
available to be tagged no one no one
like even Rachael from 87 days before or
I call it ambrosia I saw her do the tag
and I was like we're kind of friends on
Twitter and like like we're kind of
friends and she does this tag and she
doesn't tagged me I was like you were my
last hope but no after today I'm taking
myself again to do the colors of the
rainbow tag so without any further like
a tomb
let's go so the first color of the
rainbow is red um at least that's what
they told me for red I chose the lip mix
by Mac called crimson and this is
basically my go-to rat lipstick you
can't compare this to remove Ruby woo
Russian red LMS cons box Illamasqua
whatever this is my holy grill rat
lipstick it's the perfect red for about
anyone on this planet it's the perfect
red for for like any occasion where you
want a red pout oh it's not a pout it's
a truly stunning red lipstick that is
creamy its pigmented it stays on for
hours it's a matte finish and it's
basically a makeup artist like red
lipstick dream like a wet dream next in
line is orange I call it the color of
the Dutch cheese Holland
the product I chose is by Kryolan and
this is the UV de colo aqua color and
this is a water activated sort of cream
product and this is neon like hell and
Cameron just looks like a normal orange
but in real life oh my gosh this is so
bright and I love it so much because it
is orange to the max I used this on my
new neons photo shoot from Fisher milk
and I will put a link down below to see
what I did on my model but I use this on
the middle of my models lip to really
give that pout like a POW a pow pow
it does crease a bit and it is kind of
hard to use but the colour is in vain
and I recommend like if you want a neon
orange get this in your life you can use
this in your brows if you want to be a
really artsy fartsy and everything I
believe I did that in a Hunger Games
tutorial I used this in my brows I
believe I'm not sure get it mixed up is
yellow and for yellow I chose of course
this isn't a shock this is my H&amp;amp;M shirt
in yellow is not my color
I saw some of you tweet to me that you
got it as well because of me and you
sent pictures of you wearing it and that
just like it it just makes my broken
heart complete and and like healed again
for green I chose this neon green nail
polish by China Glaze and this is called
um the Kiwi cool ah de Cuba colada Kiwi
colada human colada is there some kind
of pun I don't get in this so this is
China glaces Kiwi colada killer a cola
and this is a neon green polish which
I'm wearing right now um I have some
tips forget me I love this nail polish
it is so insane and my boyfriend loves
green so whenever I wear this he goes
crazy and he's like oh my god your nails
not like that but more men would like oh
my god no no green is actually not my
type of color I'm not a big like green
green lover gel Chilton uh bubble buddy
but so green nail polish love this for
Balu I chose this hairspray by Bed Head
TIGI and this is the masterpiece massive
shine hairspray
I adore this stuff I found out about
this and looks by Sherman's home we did
a sleepover with like our circle friends
and I saw this I sprayed this on I
smelled it I was like oh my gosh that is
heaven it's like an angel piston this
it's a really strong hairspray that
keeps your style but it gives shine and
the smell of this it's like cotton candy
apples mixed with a little bit of angel
piss in it it's insanely Singley nice
mixed we have indigo and I absolutely
hate indigo because I just don't like
indigo it's like make up your mind or
your blue or purple what are you I don't
really like indigo I don't really own
anything that's indigo the only thing I
could think of is this Anwar plum mega
middle I shadow by Mac new are plums and
this Inglot color play lipstick palette
has a really nice indigo this one right
here I would call that an indigo I love
that color maybe I do like indigo then
the next is violet purple for purple I
chose my favorite favorite favorite
purple eyeshadow by sugarpill again and
this is called poison plum perfect
perfect perfect purple this is like a
purple dream like your purples couldn't
get any better than this it's the sugar
pill it's an amazing company an amazing
team and amy is amazing that like the
CEO and poison plum is stunning so those
were the colours of the rainbow now the
person who creates this tag was like we
need pink and multicolored so um pink is
next in line for pink it was actually
quite hard because I always think that
pink is one of my favorite colors but
then when I actually look around I'm
like I don't um wait my curtains are
pink and Larry and Steve Larry and Steve
are pink okay the first pink product is
by Barry M and this is the 52 lipstick
this is my go-to neon pink lipstick this
is whenever
I want neon pink matte lips 52 by Barry
M it's the perfect go-to color it's
affordable it's cheap it's a good
quality it's good looks like a good
product it's nice it's nice and then I
have this brush by Real Techniques and
this is the blush brush it has a pink
handle it's as soft as Bambi's tail it's
amazing and I love this brush and every
time I use this on my models they're
like that's soft okay so from
multi-coloured um I suck at that
probably what I'm wearing right now this
dress Bairam be calm this is the
screaming Simpsons dress that is
actually assured on me because every
dress turns out to be assured on me
because of my life and if I had to
choose another multi-coloured product
it's this Inglot palette the color play
lipstick Peled it has all the colors
that you need for your lips and you can
mix and you can use it on your eyes and
you can use it for everything and it
just has amazing colors and again I for
