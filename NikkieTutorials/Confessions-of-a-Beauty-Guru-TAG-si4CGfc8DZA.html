thought it was really fun to do the
confessions of a beauty guru tag
normally I'm not the biggest fan of tags
because I find most of them too gimmicky
too too much but I saw a couple of girls
do the confessions of a beauty guru Tegh
and I thought it was really fun because
it really kind of shows you a day in the
life of a beauty guru so today I'm going
to do that I guess the number one how
many hours a week do you spend filming
and editing videos basically whenever I
make a video I start around 12:00 at
noon and then I basically I'm done at
around 11:00 at night I'm such a
perfectionist I want everything to be
perfect so I want my setup to be perfect
I want my lighting to be perfect I want
my editing to be perfect my pictures to
be perfect so I kind of edit everything
and that basically takes me 12 hours and
when I do like crazy crazy videos it
takes me more than a day I know a lot of
crews are quicker than me but I'm just
I'm just so nitpicky and I want
everything to be perfect so I kind of go
into every little detail I film about
two or three days per week so when I say
I film 2 or 3 days per week that means
that 2 or 3 days I'm busy on working on
videos ok question number 2 are you a
spender or a saver
I'm a little bit of both I love to spend
money on clothes makeup hair stuff but
that's all for my work as well because
makeup and hair stuff mostly goes into
my kit for on shoots and shows but I'm
also safer because when I know I really
really need something and I really
really need to stay for something I'm
safe so right now I'm saving for a car
and then probably after that I'm gonna
stay for my own home for a house or an
apartment or something but I'm a spender
but also a saver for the good things
number three when is it easiest for you
to film probably like 1 p.m. is when I
always start filming on I used to film
at night all the time but I'm kind of
over that because at night
just wanna watch a movie watch a show
and just lie in bed and just relax
number four what makes talking in front
of the camera comfortable for you mainly
experience it takes a little while
before you actually in your head things
like I'm talking to people now and not
to a camera afternoon this for four and
a half years now so my experience is
there so it takes time to get used to
talking to this device that record you
it's as if all my subscribers are like
contained in this little thing and
you're all in it and I'm talking to you
it takes time but just just yourself
basically just takes time it took me
about two years before I got completely
comfortable in front of the camera
number five what's your worst makeup and
hair habit when I smudge mascara on my
lash line where you normally for your
eyeliner I just kind of leave it there
I'm just like I'm not even gonna try to
get all the smudges off I kind of like
the effect it gives you like grungy
effect I like to think it gives you your
grungy effect it might look horrible and
for my hair it's um maybe I used too
much hairspray I'm a hairspray lover I
use too much of it number six one quote
that you wish the world would live by
live every day as if it is your last
that is one motto that has been in my
life all the time I try to live my life
as it is my last day here you never know
what could happen to you like maybe a
plane crashes on top of your head right
now maybe you get a seizure maybe
there's a killer inside of your home
maybe there's a killer under my bed
right now who knows my motto is to live
every day as if it is your last and I
think a lot of people can really learn
something from that just live number
seven how long do you spend getting
ready every day this is really bad but
it takes me about an hour and a half I
hate like having 30 minutes to do
everything I just can do it I hate
stress so I rather sleep an hour less
then stressed in the morning I usually
take
about an hour and a half to just do
everything in a Zen mode this Zen mode
is to keep people number eight your
favorite video on YouTube it's probably
one of Lisa eldritch because I love that
woman she is so talented and she does so
many great things and I basically love
every video that she does number nine a
youtuber that you watch who deserves
more views Plus subscribers than they
have jump onto us a day he is talented
as crap and I still feel like he has
like only a fraction of subscribers that
he really deserves also so coulomb she
deserves millions and millions of
subscribers also be face honey I think
she's around fifty as well and she
deserves so much more so so so much more
one thing you're excited about in the
upcoming year probably beautto bird
because I'm gonna do a video every other
day in October and I'm gonna call it
mute Oh Bart so I'm really really
looking forward to that and I want to go
to London this year to kind of close it
all off I've been wanting to go to
London for years now and I've never
really got around to do that so I really
want to go to London this year so beaut
over and a possible trip to London
number 11 your most Awkward filming
moment I think one video there was one
video like way back I did an Arabic look
which I had a cold and I felt like crap
and my dogs were barking like crazy and
I got so annoyed by them and I just shut
it and I left that in the video and I
uploaded it and stuff that was really
awkward I deleted it like one week after
because I was ashamed of myself
number twelve how long does it take you
to prep for a video about an hour I
don't really have to do my hair and then
I have to oh it's a little bit more two
hours because I don't really have to do
my hair Foundation one eye closed
probably yeah number thirteen are you
wearing pants right now or are you
actually wearing pajama bottoms is this
like the main rule for like beauty
beauty guru land that every person on
here is wearing pajama pants including
me right now where my friends I mean why
would you wear something tied if you
could wear something loose and
comfortable and and nice last question
number 14 what are you most proud of in
your life I'm most proud of what I have
accomplished so far I'm 18 years old now
and I have a channel on YouTube that has
over 200,000 subscribers I am a teacher
at the school of makeup where I learned
everything and I've done shoots for
magazines I am in an agency right now
for makeup artists and hair artist I'm
pretty proud of myself actually today I
guys gets it that concludes the
confessions of a beauty guru tag I
really love doing this it kind of makes
you talk about your YouTube lying a
little bit more and I love tags like
this where you can just talk and just
answer some questions so you guys so
much for watching I am on Twitter
Facebook and Instagram that all is
making tutorials again think again so
much for watching and hopefully I will
see you guys next time so yes I look</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
