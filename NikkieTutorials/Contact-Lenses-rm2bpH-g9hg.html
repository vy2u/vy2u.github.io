about context contact lenses um when I
started wearing context because my
vision got worse and worse I never
really found videos on YouTube
explaining what to do how you can put
them in and meet isafe and just get the
best out of your contacts so I have that
for around a year or two
no I was good for around a year now and
I feel like I now really know what to do
with my contact today I'm going to show
you how to put in your contacts have to
take them out how to take care of them
tips and tricks we're not really tips
and tricks I'm just going to show you
how I put them in and all that good
stuff
okay so the lenses I'm gonna I'm wearing
my normal my contacts right now they are
not colored or anything they are just
transparent and this is my real eye
color nothing special at all
sometimes I've blue eyes sometimes of
blue-green eyes just weird but anyways
so the light the lenses I'm going to
show you are from attitude Holland and
edited Holland is this amazing flight
which has all these clothes makeup eye
contacts as accessories um I don't know
what and it's fake hair wigs everything
and I believe they ship outside the
Netherlands as well and I got the
amazing opportunity to choose a one pair
of lenses and use them so I went ahead
and took some bright at school ones and
I took the number 46
they're called terrorize and they're
called Cathedral 46 or 4 not sure but on
what this says is it is it has no power
so I need power for my eyes so I'm only
wearing these for it in my videos so I
do not have to undress itself to look
away because I have like the vision
about far away I cannot see and
everything so that is what they are they
are 12 months after opening they last
for 12 months so I will put all the
information about these in the sidebar
and where I can get them and all that
good stuff in the sidebar so I'm not
going to take out my normal lenses and
then I'm going to show you these how to
put them in I'm going to show you these
because these are not transparent so you
can see it a little bit better so be
right back
that's a close-up right okay so I took
them out and my vision is blurry right
now so I keep them
lens cases like this but with the left
and the right okay so I'm taking my ring
finger and my lenses are in this box
okay and I'm putting my finger in that
box and now it's all my finger can't see
that and then I'm taking it with my
thumb and the index and put it on my
index finger like that when I'm now
gonna do is take a hand mirror and it
will look up let me see
okay let me show you this so it's still
on my finger on my finger and now I'm
gonna look up and put it on that white
spot under my eye so that why that is
where I'm gonna place it and then I'm
gonna look up and then it should move to
the place it should be so just watch put
it on a white space hold it there
remove finger and then push it to the
right side and then it isn't so you
might get air bubbles and when you get
air bubbles you do this
just push it push it up and that will
get rid of the eye bubbles the bubbles
under your left so let me show you one
more time
it is on my ring finger my thumb and my
index are going to take it now put it on
the other index finger like so and with
these you can totally see if it's the
inside out or the outside in because you
can see where the print should be so let
me show you one more time I'm looking
down can i push it up and then blink a
few times like that so that's how I put
them in so basically it's really simple
to get them in it's just moving your
lower part of your eye below get that
white space put them in and you most
definitely gonna get air bubbles push
them up like that to get the air bubbles
out and then blink a few times and it
should be in um you need to practice
practice practice practice practice
makes perfect because don't you dare
thinking I got this right the first time
I was like peeling in my eye and start
tearing and it was up was not fun at all
what I do recommend is putting your eye
contacts there before you do your makeup
I did it after my makeup right now
because I wanted to show you but I
really recommend them them in before you
put your makeup on and taking them out
before you remove your makeup so put
them in before you do your makeup and
put them out but take them out before
you take off your makeup so again these
are terrorized by attitude holland
number oh four cathedral and i'm not
sure
you cannot see it but the white and this
have like little hearts which is really
pretty and these are great for Halloween
i need to be honest with you um these
lenses are
a little bit too small for me because I
can see the part that is around the
black of my eyes of their black spot in
the middle around that I can see the
stroke of the contact lens this not this
not this will not be for everyone this
just made me because I've big eyes or
bigger irises if that's what you call it
I'm not sure about anyways umm so for me
there are a little bit too small but
this is just for my video so I don't
care but date might be the perfect size
for you again the slices are in the
sidebar so you can check it out if they
fit you or if you just want to wear them
for a video and now let's go ahead and
show you how to take them out okay so to
take them out it's really easy again
you're just gonna wait in my hands
you're just gonna look wait are you
seeing this you're seeing like you're
gonna look down this looks creepy and
you're gonna put this down again and
shut them to be underside or something
and take them with your thumb and your
index they're up and then you put them
back in the box with clean contact
lenses fluid stuff I'm looking down
these in my hand mirror and I'm put this
to be just pull that down and then take
your index and shove it down and take it
so yeah that's basically everything
there is to putting them in and taking
them out on again practice practice
practice practice um if you have to
longer nails be careful you don't like
scratch them or break them apart so be
careful with your lenses be nice to them
don't keep them in when you're going to
sleep take them out don't wear it ever
for too long because
we'll get infections in your eye wear
your glasses as well I'm gonna show you
around my wear glasses I have really
really ugly glasses but I only wear them
in the house and these are my glasses
but again I only wear them laying in bed
watching TV night so yeah I hope this
was a little bit helpful to you if you
have any questions I will try to answer
them again I don't know any everything
about anything I do is nothing
I do not know everything about them but
I will try to do my best and there's
always Google if I cannot find it so I
hope this was helpful and if you have
any questions leave them in the comment
section so thanks for watching fight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
