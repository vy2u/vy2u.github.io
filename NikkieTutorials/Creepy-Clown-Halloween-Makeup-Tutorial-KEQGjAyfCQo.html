Halloween tutorial of 2014 for this look
I wanted to be this devastated lonely
clown I was once a super money-making
successful clown and everyone came to
the circus to see me and all of a sudden
I got replaced by a younger better
version of myself and I just got dumped
and as an end result and this pink
devastated horrible looking creature so
the first thing I'm doing is making my
skin white using the fils art extreme
color art in white sensation and what
you want to keep in mind is that you
definitely do not want this to be
perfect you're this devastated depressed
clown who got dumped so her base is not
gonna look good
and as I say you just want to apply it
super messy and once I got that first
layer on I'm actually going back in with
the whites and just basically stabbing
my face and just making it a whole hot
damn mess
then I went ahead and also dragged that
white onto my neck and as I said keep it
messy don't be too neat and perfect with
this
and now I'm actually taking some water
and making the most obnoxious face ever
and then you just really want to spritz
your face and make the entire face paint
wet again and then go back in with a
brush and then you can really fudge up
your base and that is exactly what you
want now if you feel like you've taken
too much away you can always go back in
with the whites and they can always make
it a little bit more white again so it's
really a controlled mess now I'm taking
another v-sign Pro extreme color art
impassionate red and I'm applying this
to my entire eye area and I just started
off at the lids and then I went a little
bit further up and just a little bit
more further up and I really like to
where that was going to so I kind of
went up and up and up and then I just
started feathering some strokes of red
in and I kind of just played with it
really
so just lightly flicking the red up and
giving it really nice pain strokes as if
I really have lived in that red for days
for the lower lashline I'm also taking
that read again and the lowest person
you want to be on the sides of your eyes
so the lowest portion is going to be
sort of where you normally would
highlight and just make it really lived
in and sunk in and just really bad
really
then with a red eyeshadow I'm using one
by sugarpill it's called a love plus I
am further defining that red up and I'm
sort of creating a haze which is going
to yet again give that really nice lived
in feel and I wanted to go for this sort
of clown rounded shape but then later on
I decided to make it more of a point
because later on I'm going to points to
my lips and everything so you just
really want to play with this
then going back in with my white
facepaint and going through the red and
this to give it a more distressed look
and I really like this effect because it
makes it so messy but in a controlled
way I really like that I like having a
controlled mess on my face
now with my Kevin D tattoo liner in
trooper I am drawing the you know
original clown lines on the eyes on both
the sides and again don't be too neat
with this actually kind of want to make
it smudged in a lived-in also
then taking some extra red facepaint and
then dabbing it underneath my eye and
then with that same water I spritz it to
create these super awesome bloody tears
and this step is so much fun to do
now taking this weird little sponge and
really distressing and messing up the
entire look of my face right now so I'm
going over my eyes where I just applied
the tears I'm going over my base and
it's going to pick up colors of the red
and mix it with the white and it's going
to give a really awesome feel
Natick in some red and black eyeshadow
and running it across the inside of my
lip and then pulling it down and up and
for the lips I went for this super messy
again lived-in look this entire look is
lived in and grows and just disgusting
and then I take it all the way up to my
nose
and all the way down to my chin and then
I also pull it out to the sides to give
that really nice clown feel bed because
a lot of clowns have those really big
and white lips so I kind of went for
that feel right here and then I'm just
building upon that using some more red
eye shadow then going back in with more
black eye shadow and then I'm also
taking that sponge and distressing the
entire look up again
then I took some red and black face
paint again and went over my lips once
more and again I went all the way up to
the nose and down to the chin
then because I wanted the lips to have
the exact same feeling as the eyes I'm
going back into my Kat Von D tattoo
liner in trooper now I'm drawing on my
cutesy yet creepy clown nose
and just working on the mouth a little
bit more oh hi Alyssa Edwards running
some red lip pencil across my waterlines
and then to really make this look pop
and finish it all off I'm taking my
Elizabeth Arden 8 hour cream and
applying it straight to the eyelids and
the lips and this is going to give a
super awesome greasy feel then now it's
context time so go ahead a slap these in
slap that wig on and you're done ladies
and gentlemen and that guys completes my
creepy lonely clown Halloween makeup
