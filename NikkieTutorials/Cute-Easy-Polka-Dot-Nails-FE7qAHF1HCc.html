you how to get these amazing polka dot
nails which are super in right now and
they are so amazing so yeah without any
further ado if you want to know how to
get these polka dot nails then please
keep on watching so the first thing you
want to do is apply this base to your
nails to make your mani less as long as
possible
now gonna take this baby pink color and
just coat your entire nail with this and
I am going to use two coats just to make
everything as opaque as possible here
I'm just adding my second coat of that
baby pink polish now I'm gonna take this
a very cute sort of lilac purple color
and with this I'm kind of gonna break
the nails in two so we have to bottom
that is that baby pink color and then
the top which is the lilac II purple and
for the purple is one coat only okay
next I'm gonna take these amazing
stickers that I found in the local store
and these are sort of little dots in
sticker form sort of and what you want
to do is cut the stickers in to the
length of your nail and sort of the
width that your nail is and then with
the tweezer I'm just gonna lie that on
top of the line between the purple and
the pink
okay now you want to take a piece of
paper and white nail polish dip your
dotting tool into the white polish and
just start dotting the top purple half
of your nail I basically just went for
it and didn't really think of a pattern
but just place little dots then for the
bottom pink side just take your bigger
side of your dotting tool and just place
four dots to like in the middle and two
on the sides
in theory the white dots are actually
like little white nail polish clumps so
you really want to take your time with
this to make sure that everything is as
dry as possible and to finish it all off
all you have to do is apply a fast
drying top coat thank you guys so much
for watching I hope you enjoyed and
hopefully I will see you guys next time
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
