tutorial on this dark and vampy holiday
makeup you guys told me that from all
the looks I did this winter Wonder week
you were still missing something dark
edgy and like a bold statement lip well
here you go I definitely agree that I
still had to do one dark lip to really
give winter wonder week some and some
darkness some some emo knows
I'm also going to show you a couple of
tricks to make hooded eyes or just small
eyes in general give an optical illusion
to look larger and bigger and more
doll-like and more like Bambi yeah
without any further ado if you would
like to know how to get this makeup look
right here then keep on watching
maybe I'm looking rough if I look like a
troll you're right
so yesterday I primed using the new
Urban Decay primer products I really
liked what it did for my face I'm going
to do it again today I'm going to go in
first with the b6 mmm vitamin infused
complexion prep primate spray
yesterday I went for the self adjusting
one today I'm going to go for the DISA
lick one I want to try them out both and
again this is shine controlling pore
minimizing and mattifying and I'm gonna
put it mainly on my t-zone cuz that's
where I get oily the rest of my face is
a dry desert this is a lot more grip to
it the self adjusting one was very
watery this is a little bit more thick
what I really feel it mattifying my face
now oh my god do you see how it's
blurring my face yes that's what I want
for foundation today I wanted to be
long-lasting because I'm going to
meetings I really liked what the
infallible by L'Oreal did for my face
but it did agree with the comments that
I write yesterday that it is a little
bit too pinky for my skin tone so I'm
going to mix it in with a more yellow
toned foundation to counteract the
rosiness
for concealer an oldie but a goodie the
it cosmetics bye bye under-eye
and to make sure our base looks flawless
all day long and we will not get any
creasing now it's your time to bake and
now go ahead and set the rest of your
face with a little bit of powder as well
to make sure our makeup but you know
what never mind with this Mac powder in
the color emphasized I'm going to set my
crease to brow bone area to he'll
blending later on this will also make
the final look look a lot more cleaner
and precise I'm going in with the
palette of all palettes 3500m by morphe
this has been my go-to palette lately
and going in with this color to define
the crease softly this step is
completely optional
I have hooded eyes so I need that little
bit of definition in my crease but if
you have beautiful gorgeous bigger eyes
you don't need this as a base for some
shimmer on my lid I'm going to use this
magnificent metal eyes by Stila and this
is in the color kitten and I like going
in with my finger first to apply it
straight on to the lid and then finesse
it with a brush
then overtop with a damp brush I'm
applying kitsch this pigment by Mac and
this is going to go all the way over the
lid for a nice shiny pinky touch now
using this Ben Nye neutralizer cream
crayon I'm going to draw a new water
line to open up my eyes I saw this
technique over a Karima McKinney's
channel and I loved what it did for the
eyes now quickly setting this using a
light matte eye shadow and are right
underneath that with a small definer
brush you want to create a new lower
lash line using some Brown shadow and
then with a pencil brush I slightly blur
out the edges highlighting my inner
corners using my favorite morphe pressed
pigment in Champagne Nights
and four lashes I'm going to go in with
Lily lashes goddess and if you feel like
your lashes don't blend in nicely I
always like putting a little bit of
eyeliner on the inner corners very close
to the lash line now applying a little
bit of mascara on the lower lashes but
make sure you only apply it starting
from your new lower lash line and to
make a look a little bit more realistic
I'm also playing some lower lashes on to
my new lower lash line Ubbe got an
optical illusion up in here
let's contour because I want to looks
Elaine like I promised yesterday I'm
gonna use my makeup geek contouring
powders and I'm gonna make a mixture
between these two shades r.a humor the
cooler tone one is called breakup and
the warmer tone one is called love truth
love triangle okay sign me up
if this winter wonder week hasn't
inspired you to try a huge fan brush for
your contour I don't know what will
Christmas is closer than ever so I'm
going to get my gonna get my stand tall
on I'm gonna get this beard on my face
I'm going to grab some RCM a no color
powder and I'm going to clean up right
underneath my contour to give me a nice
lifted and clean effect
I need the snapchat filter right now ho
for blush gonna take this Geo a blush in
the color rose and format glow today of
course I'm going to go in with my morphe
pressed pigment in Champagne Nights it's
going to tie in beautifully with the
eyes
and now gently moving the powder and
you're left with a clean perfect cheek
her lips are gonna go for a statement
dark metallic lip I'm gonna go in with
my Oprah liquid lipstick in the colour
Napa Valley
ah do you see that purple that's why I
have a purple backdrop all right so this
is a dark color so take your time
applying this take your time maybe book
an appointment for someone to talk to
after this cuz it's stressful oh love
that color
you
and I do want to go in with a little bit
of a darker shadow on the outer corners
here because I know we're going to keep
the ice a little bit more soft and nici
terms but if you like that outer corner
needs a little rush there I like the
just a tad better it just it just yes
and to seal the deal some setting spray
