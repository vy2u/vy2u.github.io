happy 2017
holy crap 2016 is over and done with
that we never want to talk about it
again today as my first video of 2017 I
want to show you my December hits Anna
God knows because after winter Wonder
week I just kind of needed a break to
detox my skin from all the makeup but
mostly and mainly because of the glitter
challenge yeah the glitter challenge
after I did the full phase using only
glitter challenge my skin was dead like
rest in peace like it was over in order
to get all the glitter off I had to do
this motion right here and glitter is
like glass so I was basically scrubbing
my face with glass and it literally felt
like I removed three layers of my skin
after that my skin got so sensitive so
dry like extremely extremely dry I don't
think my skin has ever been that dry in
my life before and I went to my mom
crying I was like mom my mom is a
beautician so she knows her skin I was
like mom save me please cuz I feel like
wizkid is dead so she gave me a bunch of
new products to try out and to really
help reactivate my skin because my skin
was over so one part of december was
totally makeup filled especially with
when to wonder week but then the other
half of december was like dead rest in
peace my life is over this is never
getting back to normal again
and that is gonna give you a little
tease on what's to come for my favorites
slash hits for the month of december so
you know what let's just start off with
skincare while we're at it I've always
been a fan of Hanna skincare products
and I'm a huge huge fan of the
remodeling cream and I thought
remodeling cream was gonna save me from
this ultimate dryness but it didn't like
it took two weeks for my skin to get
back to normal and I will say though now
that my mom has hooked me up with new
products I feel like my skin is better
than ever before so I have this right
here this is called the Hana cell
recovery
cream ding-ding-ding that sounded like
exactly what I need it for my skin cell
recovery cream this is by far the
thickest most luxurious cream
moisturizer I've ever used for my face
it is thick it is rich it is going to
nourish every dry spot on your face take
care of it make love to it and leave you
after it is honestly so amazing for the
skin at first I was like you know what
nothing has come to save my skin at this
point but this literally did my mom
hooked me up with like six new products
to try out and from those new six
products this was one of them and it's
by far my favorite because I feel like
this did the most and I feel like for
anyone having super severe dry skin out
there honestly give this a go it took me
a week to fully let my skin absorb it
all but it worked as to remover for I
think three to five years now I've been
using a makeup studio eye makeup remover
and it is it was my they discontinued it
always used to be my absolute holy grill
like nothing compared to it and then
they discontinued it and I wanted to I
wanted to do things I wanted to drive up
their headquarters and talk to them so
that's when I kind of ventured into the
Lancome um the the Lancome the blue eye
stuff makeup remover and that was nice
but it made my eyes sensitive I have a
lot of eye makeup on it takes a village
to get this off and the makeup studio
one was the only one getting it off for
me and the Lancome one it took it off
but still it would make my lashline
sensitive it would make the corners of
my eyes very sensitive and we're leaned
up it would make my eyes dry even though
it was an oil so my mom was like you
know what they came out with a new one
it's no longer blue it's now pink and
she was like I don't know if it's the
same you honestly just have to try it
and I waited trying this out for like so
for like two months because I didn't
have any trust in it I was like if if
they just continue something good it's
never going to be as good
was before honey I was wrong they came
out with this makeup studio daily
cleansing beef aids and makeup remover
so they changed the color from blue to
pink and it's better than ever before
this right here takes my eye makeup off
so easily like a house of lashes eyelash
glue gone a ski tow eyelash glue gone
any waterproof crazy makeup gone it is
so amazing this is my second bottle I'm
already all the way down here it's
everything it's everything I'm going to
say right here right now this is the
best eye makeup remover I've ever tried
in my life urban decay recently launched
a lot of new priming products and
finishing sprays and this little guy
right here is new as well this is their
D slick complexion primer and this has
shine control it is pore minimizing and
it is mattifying now I've tried a couple
of them in previous videos especially
during winter wonder week and out of I
think they came out with four out of all
four this one is my absolute favorite
because I tried this in the video too it
just it has a lot of grip to it which
I'm like okay we're doing stuff it
completely blurs out the look of pores
it gives it sort of like a matte veil it
looks a little ashy so for all my darker
skin girls out there don't be alarmed
once you put foundation over top the ash
eNOS is gone but it makes it like a film
of a little bit of a sheen as' but it's
matte and my t-zone gets going
throughout the day like it my t-zone is
like I'm out goodbye I'm oily and with
this I really noticed it keeping my oily
t-zone non oily longer throughout the
day I only put it on my nose right above
my brows forehead chin that is where I
get the oiliest
and this keeps the oils at bay it is it
is big it is so good for keeping your
makeup on longer I really really enjoyed
this one I know I've talked about these
eyeshadows way too damn much what I'm
gonna do it again these are completely
like
these are eyeshadows by cosette I bought
these in New York my favorite shop to
buy makeup at in New York is El Cajon El
Cajon has a more rare type of makeup
like like the rare type of Pokemon that
you walk into it's like the makeup that
you don't see in every store out there
so it makes it more special and it has a
purpose like they don't sell that
doesn't do anything for I feel like
everything at El Cajon has a purpose for
your face and it works and so I walked
in when it was a New York couple weeks
ago and I saw these shadows right here I
started off buying five the next day I
went back in bought five more and I
think I bought almost all the colors
from the entire collection now I put
them in a little makeup forever Z
palette thingy it's a magnetic palette
but these are the Cosette shadows right
here I love this color story right here
like it makes me somewhat happy the main
reason why I'm so in love with these is
that the pigment is on working real okay
let's let blood glows
this shade is one of my favorites hello
hello
this red oh this red hello hello I swear
every color is so freakin pigmented such
good and rich quality it is such it's
like it makes me happy playing with them
when I'm doing my makeup and it's time
to play with the shadows I like I bust
these out and I get I had physically
happy like I feel a warm sensation going
through my body I get excited I get
happy and I feel great about my life a
lot of people would ask me what is your
favorite shade honestly it doesn't
matter what shade you get they're all
freaking bomb does I just color right
here as a matte and I love using that on
my brow bone to crease to really set my
primer and to make everything that I put
over top on make it blend way nicer just
every shade is pigmented rich fun to
play with and just the color range is
beautiful
they have brights they have neutrals
they have a couple fun pop of colors as
purple is life B shadows
are amazing all right next up let's talk
about our glow our blind
this right here is by Maybelline I've
put off talking about this for a little
bit because it hadn't launched yet but I
believe it is available everywhere now
this is by Maybelline it is called the
master strobing liquid in the color 100
if you follow me on snapchat you know
that I've talked about this a lot when
Maybelline invited me over to New York
to play with their new products this one
by far is like magic that they're going
to put out like this is what we people
have waited for this is a liquid
highlighter and first of all the color
is absolutely insane and blinding like
it is gonna like people are gonna see
their reflection in it oh yes baby there
we are but my favorite part about this
is is that I do not love cream
highlighters they they must have my base
they show my true colors which is the
red tomato just cream highlighters mess
up my foundation and concealer too much
but with this it just glides over top of
the foundation plus once it sets it's
not going anywhere I swatch it back on
my hand in New York and I did my thing
and it completely said and dried and I
couldn't rub it off like I couldn't rub
it off I needed a wipe like a strong
wipe so put this down as a base go over
top with a powder highlighter and baby
you're gonna shine and while we're
talking about highlighters I found some
new favorites this one by Mac has been
really doing it for me this is called
double gleam it's an extra dimension
skin finish it is so nice this is a worm
pale champagne and warm pillow
champagnes kind of freaked me out
because usually they look too dark or
too warm on me that went in certain
types of lights it looks like a brown
swipe but this actually doesn't it makes
me look beautiful and luminous and I
love it it is more pricey because it is
Mac but it is so pigmented you only need
a little bit and it just it just makes
you glow now another highlight that has
stolen my heart this little tiny baby
veggie way I talked about this too many
times
winter wonder week but I'm going to do
it again because I just feel like people
need this in their lives
this is ice mini highlighter and I was I
think I was the first one to introduce
it on snapchat when they were still
creating this and then it finally
launched in December or even no no it
launched in December I've had the
privilege to play with this way before
it launched and I couldn't talk about it
but now if I wanted to put this in the
last month's favorites but I couldn't
because it wasn't out yet this stuff is
what dreams are made of it is a people
kind of like what is this color it is a
light base but with a gold and pinky
duochrome so in sun lights is gonna look
beautifully and golden and white like a
white gold but then when you turn your
face it kind of shifts into a
beautifully pearly pink oh it is so
pretty
and it just makes you look like a
goddess you're gonna ask me to choose
between double gleam and ice ice all the
way I paired double gleam and ice for my
highlight today it's on my cheekbones on
my nose and baby fire just fire no ice
snow it's icy it's icy fire I really
want to talk about this one right here
this is ko I'm gonna butcher this this
is called EV en avión at the jana
natural mineral water facial spray and
okay so this does not work as the facial
sprayed this is not going to set your
makeup beautifully it is to me it's
basically mineral water and that's it
it's it's water in a bottle that you
spray this doesn't work as a setting
spray this doesn't work as a priming
spray you know what it works for okay
okay normally when you have a pigment or
a shadow and you want to use it wet what
do we do we wet the brush now how do we
wet the brush we can grab a little bit
of water put it in a little bottle put
in a little Bowl put it in something
that we can dip our brush into and then
we have a wet brush and then we can
apply
damn pigment or shadow to our eyes what
with this you can okay if people have
been doing this for years I apologize I
only found out about this this month
with your Evian bottle you can spray
your brush because its water and that
makes it damp and you can apply your
damp stuff onto your eyes what you don't
have to use fix+ any works that's
expensive eviant is way less expensive
than fix+ and it does what you want it
to do and the makeup artist who did my
makeup was like oh yeah you do it to
dampen your brushes without any like
hassle of like getting a bowl with water
or like licking your brush genius I
really want to tell you who taught me
that trick but that would give away my
project so I'm not I'm not gonna tell
you yet not until the practice out and
last but at least this brush right here
if you've been watching winter wonder
week I found out that you can contour
using a large ass fan brush and it is
amazing to contour with and ever since
winter one to week this is the only
brush I have used to contour my face
with this is the morphe m14 three I
haven't been able to put this down and
just is everything you guys I highly if
you have a large bigger fan brush just a
lying around and gentlement to do with
it try contouring with it and like it
will cut your cheeks into oblivion it
will make him so sharp so bitchy yes yes
yes yes yes I love the city so much so
those were all my hits for the month of
December the last month of 2016 and now
let's go on to my yoga dose oh yeah No
all right so my first oh god no oh my
god
I can't believe I'm talking about this
don't kill me Mariah Carey and Mac came
out with a beautiful collection like it
was stunning it was glitter upon
diamonds and diamonds upon glam and I
was a living for the packaging of it all
so I went to the airport
right and bought this little palette
right here this is called it's
everything it has the colors diamond
butterfly I'd give my all twinks and
images of rapture I swatch this in the
store and weirdly enough I loved it I
wanted it I bought it and then was I
finally got to play with it it led me
down so badly this coloring here lured
me in like this color was where it was
at it just it doesn't really translate
it becomes is like very sheer and very
thin almost sort of scatter II glitter
shadow and normally I'm all about the
glitter and the shine and the glam but
this is like a sheer patchy form of it
and then this color right here it has a
weird chain to it that makes it once you
put it on the lid it kind of translates
as dead and then once you put it in the
crease it kind of translates as a muddy
mess now the color I do like is this one
right here called twinks which is like a
warm deep shiny brown but that is a
permanent color that you can get all the
time for Mac so I'm so sorry Mariah but
this is not as good as I wanted to be a
performance though her boobs looked
really pretty though the end girl no on
to my last move my god onto my last oh
god no of the month this one right here
is by girl ah girl and this is called
the Mitya Heat's base primer now people
you guys know that I love the gold
primer the one everyone is talking about
the gold primer but this one right here
I'm like why is this on the market it
has lovely pearly pinky balls I'm all
about lovely pearly pink oh I'm all
about the balls I expected this to kind
of transform my face like it does with
the gold prep the gold primer lifts my
face gives my makeup on longer and just
makes me look radiant and healthy
whereas this is like putting on
nothing on your face like you don't see
anything of the shaggy pinky pearls on
your face when you do it's like a Fleck
of pink I don't notice anything keeping
it all longer I don't notice it doing
anything for the visibility of my pores
I don't see it doing anything for like
lifting or clearing or brightening it's
just putting on a layer of very
expensive nothing and people it's a note
and on that note those were my hits and
God knows for the month of December 2016
