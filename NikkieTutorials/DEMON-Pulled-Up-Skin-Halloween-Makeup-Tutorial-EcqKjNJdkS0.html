Halloween makeup tutorial right here
this is a pulled up like watch watch me
do it oh my god what this is a pulled up
skin slash inner demons Halloween makeup
tutorial and this is a girl who's been
possessed by a demon and if you lift her
skin away you could see the demon who is
very ferociously contoured and
highlighted which with is the demon up
to my standards now what gave me the
inspiration for the super here was this
post on Instagram this girl right here
is called argh by Maz and she did a look
where she had pulled up skin and a
pumpkin demon underneath her skin and I
loved that idea so much so I just had to
recreate it for Halloween definitely go
check her out I will put her Instagram
down below and go follow her she is
talented beyond words yeah Here I am I
am so excited for this look and if you
want to know how to get this look for
Halloween then keep on watching alrighty
let's get these inner demons to the
surface I don't know if I want this
alright so the first thing I'm going to
do is cover up one eyebrow with glue
this will be the demon side so I want my
brow to be gone and then of course this
side is going to be my normal true self
alright so what I'm gonna do is I'm
going to take Elmer's washable school
glue this is purple verse drag down my
hair using the glue stick so you get
every little corner of that hair I'm
gonna take a little toothbrush and push
all the hairs straight up then once
they're straight up I will go over top
with some glue again to push him in that
direction even more and follow with the
toothbrush
rub away any excessive glue to keep your
skin texture like actual skin and not
like textured glue skins and then once
it's dry you want to set it in place
with powder so that it will last all day
long until you take your makeup off you
want to take a hefty amount of powder
like a lot of powder we're pressing this
in to the brow you want to press up and
down you don't want any movement because
then you can erupt the hairs from the
glue again making them stick out again
so just press it up and down quite
forcefully to set it in place and now
all you have to do is take a big brush
and blend away the powder from your face
and your brows are covered all right now
what I'm going to do is do my normal
face of my makeup so my normal true self
off-camera we've seen this too many
times so I'm just going to do that
off-camera to save time and then we'll
start with the deepen alright a power of
makeup 2.0 anyone should BAM alright so
now it's time to actually get into the
fun part of this tutorial with my brow
pencil and with this we're kind of
sketching out where we want the lifted
part of her face to be and you can
always go back in if you don't like
certain parts of it you can always
remove the sketch and go back in and
change it but I feel like this is sort
of where I want to go too so this entire
part right here is going to be covered
with red and this will become our demon
if firm eye red I'm going to go into the
may run paradise paint palette this is
water activated paint and I'm gonna go
into the color red and Beach berry I'm
gonna mix the two together and this will
be filled up all the way throughout our
face okay we're go
with a smaller more detailed synthetic
brush I'm going to go right up the edges
to get a clean cut
and go ahead and go over your now
perfectly blocked brows and as you can
see they're gone
alright now I'm going to hop into the
sugar pill pallet and taking this red
color right here called the love+ and
setting all of this just to be sure and
to make blending easier
alright now I'm going to go into black
eye shadow and create depth and
dimension right around my eyes then also
taking it down the nose now define my
lower lash line and create a lot of
depth here and I don't know why I'm
being precise right now because after
this is going to smoke and blow it out
all the way so just put a lot of black
around your eyes and especially here on
that outer corner is why you want
definition kind of pull the face down
now with the tiniest bit like the
tiniest bit of white eye shadow i'm
going to apply highlight surrounding the
eye I mean we don't want him to be super
one-dimensional like a flat piece of red
pancake on your face we want this to
look as realistic as possible alright
now from the brow we're creating a line
as if we have a really heavy brow bone
and from behind that line with black
shadow we want to create more shadow on
this side of the line this side of the
line the top portion of the line will
remain clean
doing the same with our temple we're
kind of creating like a weird s here and
everything from here will be shaded as
well everything in here will remain
clean and we're doing this to just give
our face a little bit more of a evil
bone structure if that makes any sense
right up that line right up against that
red line we shade and give it depth you
see how it kind of forces my brow bone
for like her and then we can always go
back in with a little bit of white right
up against the line near the black to
give it a highlight and to bring it
forward and to give it more depth again
all right now we're going to carve out
our cheekbones and make them really high
up and popped out in and kind of like a
Disney villain like really angular and
out there and like Maleficent and with
black we're going to give that shadow
and blend it into something realistic
make it look sunken in and evil so for
the jaw area you want to blend behind
the line and for the cheek area you want
to blend above the line and give it
depth see what I mean go back in with
red to soften it all right is like sort
of your transition color or like your
eraser to make everything look good
again highlight touch cheek bone with a
peach to make it pop and to bring that
forward
I'm never going to shade with black
around the nostrils to make that look
sunken in and then I was watching one of
my favorite youtubers alex faction and
he made his demon nose kind of
snake-like and really really loved that
idea so I'm going to follow along and do
that as well because I love what that
did so the nose flares up into a sharp
point upwards goes down to the nostril
again now with black eyeshadow I'm going
to add dimension and depth to the lips
and then I kind of want to come down
into a triangle under the lip darkening
up the lash line finally that gap of
skin gone
alright I'm adding texture to the
darkest part of my face using a
stippling brush this is the morphe m4
3/6 and black face paint and just kind
of randomly putting dots to make it a
little bit more now with makeup geek
mocha eyeshadow I'm going to create the
folds and wrinkles from pulling up the
skin
and I think first off right of the bed
it's perfect to just start off with your
lines and then after that we can add
shadows and highlights so just get your
lines there to get yourself in that
headspace and then we can perfect it so
the camera cut off but I've reapplied
some of the lines because I wasn't happy
with them but basically what you want to
do is create your lines as if you're
pulling the skin up and then slightly
blurred the edges and create a shadow
and then highlight to make it look like
actual pulled up skin what I'm doing now
is behind the line I'm adding a soft
shade of skin tone just to make it look
pulled back and then also what's really
important is to go in with your black
and right up against the line of where
your skin is suppose that we pulled up
you want to apply some black and fade it
down to cast a shadow see how that makes
it look like this is underneath the skin
see the effect that is giving we want
and now with white I'm going to
highlight the very top portion of the
pulled skin to bring it to life and
bring it forward
all right so I'm going to put some
contacts in and apply my wig and
fine-tune this a little bit more
off-camera but then it will be back and
that guys concludes this pulled of skin
