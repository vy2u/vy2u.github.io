watching the key for ever since I was
five years old seems so crazy watching

remember Nikki mention me in a video one
time I think like years ago she was yeah
Patrick stars and then something patrick
star and I wasn't on Twitter anything so
I think someone commented on my
Instagram Nikki mention you into videos
like do you like Halloween or Christmas
Halloween as far as like everything
makeup feels yeah what's your favorite
makeup season holy Halloween yeah also
on YouTube I feel like everyone just
presses their creative buttons mm-hmm it
really goes there
Jameer first
I believe I recreated Petri Lutz um she
was what had the rat oh my god oh my god
I have a personal question yeah that
would be so fun in a story time that you
can probably answer what is one of the
first and biggest and worst times you
got in trouble and troubled by your
minor your mom or your family or school
I don't know I've always been a perfect
kid pulled over yes
okay tell speeding speeding how much
over have you ever cheated on tests and
got caught I never got caught
okay I have you got caught yes I was a
music class and you know I'm you cheat
on music I was telling to give the
answers cuz it's like he didn't know
like between like sharps and flats I
didn't feel bad cuz I was I was a smart
kid at that class you know was just a
music class it wasn't anything crazy if
you are to ever see Nicki cheer her on
to dance like she is a pro former when
we were with benefit on the trip on the
island I had never seen Nicki dance so
hard in my life
it was just so I haven't even seen my
girl that was a do you remember I never
asked you do you were even seeing the
snapchats
like the next day and like yeah and what
were you thinking I thought that's why
my neck hurts like Nicki was breaking it
was what a lot about her and I loved it
you know there's one thing that I don't
think a lot of people know about you is
that there's such a perfectionist with
your videos yeah I always complain to
Patrick I'm like when are you gonna
start uploading more mm-hmm
and he's like well yeah I presume like
seven videos I'm like where are they god
I'm like where
I like travelling to like you know you
don't understand but it's it's so crazy
like I've become obsessed with like
quality and production and I think like
produc like I think it's just fun it's
not like TV quality but I think it's
just really really fun to like to be
creative technically like when it comes
to like cameras and stuff I feel like a
lot of people that are that are wanted
to start YouTube always feel like oh
like I don't have a camera I don't have

I'm gonna take the flash palette please
pray for me I'm going to try to attempt
to cut my dolls with this in life guys
eyes are done
oh my god it was a mission and a half we
were going drag so for our process of
his yeah it was like a nerd inner zone
and this one for villains we are going
quite season 12 Patrick actually had the
perfect idea to transform eyeliner into
boots
Wow
okay artistry let me tell you something
about drag me get Nicky can agree once
the eyes are done it smoothes family
yeah
the eyes are the hardest is the biggest
makeup lesson you ever learned like once
you knew that it was like this is what
it is I think my I think what I'm known
for or like is my transformation because
I look nothing I feel like I look
nothing how I look like without makeup
and a turban I think what it is it's
like once you have enough experience and
you're frustrated with how a look comes
out just just try it again and just keep
going I think what I learned most is
similar to that of a drag queen like you
learn your face you learn what works I'm
sure like where were you ever frustrated
with with your eye shape oh yeah the
hooded nose mmm yes I was frustrated I
guess with my nose and like my eyes cuz
I really don't have the lid and I kind
of have like a monolid but like a double
knit at the same time like you learn
your face like the more you do it and
also I think um I don't know about you
but I feel like you have other people
that do your makeup yeah I can learn
tips and tricks from them and that's
that's what I want you to do my face
with you you bring all the creative
juices out of me you you extract them
from the body
oh wow that's a good one guys
can you tell us if we're crazy that were
partying with you like this is our
version of like a little sleepover make
up and live in our family come live in
our village where their castle look at
