she's my icon she's a goddess I am so
excited to have her on my channel here
today dr. pimple popper and I got
together yesterday and she let me assist
her I wish I could have given you a
medal you are a future doctor can Papa
you were closer than anyone else today
we are doing a glam look on Sandra
herself I wanted to show to Sandra how
she could do her own look but more
glammed up and in a different light so
we went for warmer colors and she's got
a glow going on this is not something
that I I have I have to only wear when
I'm out out of work I can definitely do
this during work this is a way to be
lovely this is very natural I cry and I
feels really beautiful and that's really
what it's all about so that's it I hope
you enjoyed this video and without any
further ado let's look at to glam it and
thank you Nikki I'm so proud to know you
your watch it touch my face okay that's
it bye we're gonna turn up with this
product right here Yuri saw it by girl
it's called the gold primer gold timer
okay
it looks like golden shine like what
have you had that with with the gold
flecks in it oh so this is a primer it's
a pratical little fuss of what this
primer is known for is still lift and to
tighten and to pull to dr. Sandra Lee
who I'm just gonna post Anna in this
video she gave me an extractor yesterday
she was like this is for home and all I
did was go to the bathroom and her
practice and pop my face alright now
we're gonna go in with the foundation
we're using a Sandra's foundation which
is this Giorgio Armani one right here
she knows her stuff and abounds all over
your beautiful cheekbones face her
cheekbones are life so you are really
you always I hear that you always say
Pat you at the block just yes denim
see what happens when you rub the
foundation you're taking away all
coverage so you're trying to cover up
any imperfections which you don't have
let me just say that um but when you pat
it on you will get the maximum coverage
coverage of your product how are you
with makeup because you work in an
industry where makeup is a key to make
your skin look even better and since
people are so focused on it in this
industry like what is your opinion on um
makeup as I conceal your face I am you
know obviously my what I do there's a
big crossover overlap with cosmetics in
the cosmetic industry this is beauty in
general I'm probably the worst kind of
patient because I don't I mean I have
tables of cosmetic products that people
give me more medically based maybe but I
don't use very many of them I think the
most important thing a sunscreen use
yeah and you know that and you know that
it's very important so it's hard for me
to say I mean I'm really not that great
with makeup I will have to say most of
most the time I get my best advice from
some of my very good friends were very
good with makeup and right take me they
pull me to the the makeup store and they
tell me what to get because you know
it's hard you don't have time for me to
get to work I have kids mm-hmm have a
husband I have a job very nice just like
yeah and you know how to make it you
just need to get to work and you wearing
masks all the time so what is your daily
makeup routine like I'm sure yeah no III
get lashes extensions because that
seriously things that met only we cut
down two minutes of your day no no it
cuts down because your eyes looks much
better so quickly and for me as an Asian
to no lashes but I definitely use the
teeth to help to grow it encouraged yeah
the growth of my own lashes
so that I can have extensions attached
to them but yeah my makeup routine is
pretty simple it's probably pretty much
the same thing almost every day if I
want to glam it up more I will put more
around my eyes I would do liner
yeah I would extend my my my liner but I
usually just put like a simple like
winged eyeliner right it pretty much it
and my brows so we're going to conceal
you on your hair yes and we're first
going to warm it up which again you have
awesome skin and I could take better
care of it especially as a dermatologist
you know it's sort of like when you have
a pool and you don't go swimming so for
you you know when you visited me
yesterday you didn't wear a stick your
makeup no and I mean I think that's
fabulous because you do feel like
sometimes when you're putting on makeup
you don't want to do that every day
right if you do if you have to do it
like every day for a week to just feel
like oh oh he drained yeah I feel like I
mean I love makeup so much it's my
everything but sometimes it's good to
you know like take a break from it and
let inspiration get to you so what we're
going to do is take a little bit of
powder and we're going to set the wet
product and what this will do is keep it
on longer and it won't seep into fine
lines or anything you're amazing you
come alive you do I can see it you love
it everything so what is your most
special experience in your practice ever
like one did you go I will never ever
forget this I mean I think I get that to
a certain extent um every now and then I
don't think there's one single occasion
doesn't usually have to do with their
skin condition at all it has to do with
their personality or what they tell you
what they teach you about life and I
will say that you know this pimple
popping it might seem like ridiculous to
some might already know it will
ridiculous to people our non-public
holux like why are you doing this this
is not really important in people's
lives but it is there are people who
really are so appreciative and it
changes their life and now I'm seeing
I wouldn't have really seen that if I
had never really started to do couple
popping on a regular basis but I think
the same thing with you I think that's
why what you love about what you do now
status you can change people's lives
right it's weird what a little bit of
foundation concealer and highlighter can
do to someone and it's also you know
vain and and superficial but like
highlighter changes lives it does
honesty death so we're gonna do a soft
daytime smoky eye oh she's guess what
the nice in corner highlight because you
had the best inner corner how do you I
didn't know what I have a really good
you do you'll see when I applied that I
don't know how to do inner corner I'm
always try to get and I look like a nut
so I'm so excited so this is a primer
and this will keep the oil at me and I
always go for a lighter one to make the
eye shadows then I put over top pop and
this will keep it on all day so you make
sure you take it off today and I heard
you say I'm gonna kick out all weekend
yes but not a sleep upright to actually
that is one thing that I wish I did more
and she's no acknowledge yeah knowledge
as a dermatologist a lot of it has to do
with our skin coloring certainly in our
sun exposure and our habits you know
like smoking and things like that
network our lifestyle yeah but a lot of
it has to do with our expressions also
the way we sleep so yes I always
remember that movie memoirs of it Keisha
Keisha where she is lost sleeping you
know thought to mess her hair and she's
on this little pop like behind her neck
yes I need to sleep like that because if
I I sleep with my face smooshed into my
RG value and it just gives us I see
patients Maura right guys you mind us
our forehead because they sleep with
their face smush like that of a line
across your face so now we're going to
take a warm breathe okay I'm going to
work with oranges and had warm Brown
and s slippery I've never walked with
the orange on my eye and your life is
about to change so we're going to pop
this in that outer corner and all the
way into the crease and this will not
only warm up the look but give you this
nice sultry golden goddess feels gonna
put a nice both gold on your lid look
down for me oh you guys this color oh my
god I love it oh my gosh my eyelids have
to mention okay so on the lower lash
we're only doing a tiny bit of darkness
and definition but just you grab the
eyes a little bit more so look up from
me mainly here on the outer corner
without even noticing I'm kind of giving
you the look I'm word really I love that
that's I'm like oh that is yeah but see
I love that and look at our different
skin color tone though that's nice that
we can both wear the same thing a warm
brown I wanted to make it bright eyes
like a warm brown makes everyone not
from bow down oh no I like that I think
we're like wow and then now this is a
little too much of course so we take a
brush and we tone it down and just smoke
right at the lash line just a little bit
to make your lashes look fuller works
overtime like this
do you know people always call me
Paulette that I look like her I'd look
like stupors mom oh no you do not a
difference mom you know what I love
because I love her you too much I she's
amazing I love her Mike thank you see
you trusted me with your blackheads I
trust you with my money I will tell you
I've never seen so much highlight of my
office before you came everybody had
highlight on right you all just lambda
they all woke up an hour early to get
ready we're gonna go into people's
makeup palette my baby we're gonna take
the bronzer to bronze you up and with
the bronze for a slight softly
contouring daytime contour okay and
smells good chocolate oh my god yes do
that
mmm they're just I'm not telling you to
eat the product but kind of yeah okay
there's a big disappointment it does
you're like a peach goddess I like it
just good tell me how to do the glow
okay so because you have a more tan
complexion I was into going with a more
warm toned highlighter first so this one
right here by the juubi spice palette

a lot more nervous

yellow of course so I'm first gonna go
