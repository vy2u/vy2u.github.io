great friend well I don't even have to
introduce her in her this is Cassidy I
got the honor to do her makeup for this
video today and we got together and I
was like okay I wanted you full-on glam
like totally not Kat but also I wanted
to be Kat but a different type of cat
well I mean I always loved your approach
to makeup in general as do a lot of
people but I just thought it'd be cool
if you did something different on me
because I mean I do my own makeup I've
always done my own makeup and I tend to
probably do what a lot of people do is
get in like the rut of doing the same
thing over and over
yeah so this is this has been exciting
you know so I'm excited
Kat's excited you should be excited if
you want to know how I did this really
one thing we are wearing the same lip
color look rather than to like it's so
different on different people I like it
better on you I'm basing this to you
away he's so much for watching and if
you want to see how I did this then keep
on watching whoo I've taken off my
makeup so I am fresh and ready to go I'm
gonna look like totally sick next to you
like like Oh what do you want to do
today so since you're my queen of
Darkness I want to transform you in my
queen of like this we're gonna go super
glam okay but still with a little twist
okay it's still Kat okay but also not
Kat I'm down for whatever I think this
will be fun that's gonna be so exciting
I've never really had anybody do my
makeup like like full-on so this is
gonna be I'm that pressure I'm excited
and nervous but in a good way so it's
good yeah so what do you what do you
think you'll need cuz I have my little
makeup cause we're gonna use as many
cabanne pocket as possible cuz I'm with
her with her and then I'm just gonna add
some glitter okay cool
this is stuffs ok Cole's gonna be good
so what do you want me to bring off I'll
bring you whatever your crush metal okay
cool got your life do you primer yep I
need every foundation brow contour all
over so I'll go grab that stuff while
you hang out okay be back miss you Oh
yes mm-hmm do you guys highlighter with
you yeah okay we got the glow let's do
my lip on your lip
bow and arrow and the one I can't
pronounce the first thing we're going to
do is prime because timing is key you're
using the locket that there wait primer
and I'm just washing it in there we
start from the center of the face why
that's where we got oily first honey is
the lucky tattoo foundation and number
45 come for ten and I thought late forty
five yeah
this is a plot twist and then to give it
a little bit more I'm adding a little
bit of the Lock and Load spray in to the
foundation and then mix yeah and I just
tap the foundation in and again I start
with the center of the face cuz that's
where we block like a little delicate
flower you always want to do these
tapping motions don't rub his tap so Kat
was telling me under there yeah that I
like the legit first person to do this
it's pretty exciting did not sleep last
night mm-hmm
now we're gonna go on to the super
secret concealer that I'm not showing
you this is the prototype for a
concealer that I I love this formula so
much but obviously it's not gonna be in
that generics obviously we have to wait
five years before it launches look up
for me
you asked me about my makeup asking oh
yeah I hate it when the sides of the
nose are oily yeah it gets to me on
another level first I'm gonna make a
line
should I have my eyes closed I feel like
I should okay from above this is gonna
give structure to the brow this is going
to lift get that face the good brow if
you took me out and make sure you fill
everything in because when there's a
flash then they're taking that picture
there's holes in your brow hmm what if
we finish the makeup looking you're like
I love everything but those I highly
doubt it
I have faith and if not don't worry I'll
fake it
I'm just kidding it haha you'll know if
I hate it I'm just kidding
I'm gonna love it if it's wrong with you
no pressure I feel great about the notes
your eyes my stars she doesn't want to
use my palette because look how beat up
it is haha I opened it up I was like
okay let's do comparison look at yours
oh my god
whenever you have a little bit of fog
make a fluffy brush look up flick it
away I left a little space open right on
the center yeah and we're going to fill
that up with niceness so these are my
metal crush the best things you have
ever created so good clothes so that is
going on better and then with this we're
going to Sparkle it up make it look even
I'm going to use my eyebrow gel as the
base
this is the gel and then the glitter
okay now we highlight okay siding when I
use a mixture of these two right here
cool and in there yeah oh you never do
this I never do this
it's gonna like change my world change
everything changed a game awesome I'm
highlighting cat Lundy yes it's
happening the only friend I have that
does not highlight her yep
then I do blush cuz if you do contour
highlight and blush it'll kind of flows
perfect smile be needing meaning now
we're going to go in with bow and arrow
which is everything
then now to make it a little bit more
sorry a little bit more light I'm going
to give this color which I kept renowned
