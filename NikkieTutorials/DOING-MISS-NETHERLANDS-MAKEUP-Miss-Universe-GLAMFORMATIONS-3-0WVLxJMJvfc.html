get glam I'm gonna do Jesse's makeup and
we went for this super bombshell
glittery champagne gold look we're
wearing the same lip combo which is nice

have the same cheeks and the same we
could be sitting at our highly-prized we
could slay a bitch like bitch hello ooh
so we're gonna have so much fun we're
gonna chat we're gonna chat about how
Miss Universe was and we're just gonna
have so much fun and we're gonna get
glam and let's just get started yeah
let's go let's do it all right the first
product we're going to go in with is my
Kiehl's
this is the ultra facial moisturizer and
I love it and we're going to use it as a
base for our foundation today we're
going to go for the ex1 invisi wear
liquid foundation so I'm going to make a
mixture with F 100 and 200 and we're
just gonna blend it in using a Beauty
Blender then just start bouncing in mmm
that looks better the essence jesse has
amazing skin even though she doesn't
agree with me we're gonna keep it light
today where I would apply a mask for you
we're gonna apply a sheet mask so how
did you get started as a pretty girl
when did you know you wanted to
participate in becoming Messala my
friend just made for hire she was Miss
Evelyn 2014 and I was working for her
and a a jump in Holland and she was like
Jesse you really need to apply on a new
Miss Holland because it really suits you
normally and I was like I'm not sure but
well I don't care just go on yeah yeah I
went to the cussing
I met like already so many nice girls
and I was like oh my god I want to be
one of the finest and they're right 11
other girls so what was your favorite
thing out of the entire experience so
you became as Holland yes so after that
you had to go to the States
or was it not in the States yeah it was
in say in Las Vegas when I got crowns I
immediately tried to like do everything
from Miss Universe and from Israel
because I supposed to go to both and all
the thing happened and they were on the
same date so they chose her first time
one miss Holland's and the impossible
thing happened and they needed to yeah
how did you like the the show because a
little birdie told me that you did the
the full rehearsal and in the rehearsal
you were one of the top finalists yes I
was in a rehearsal tert oh I did the
whole show I danced with see you out of
the bikini I did everything
evening gown it was only in the life of
television and I'm really happy that I
got to experience yes yeah that's
perfect
and I did it with one of my best friends
in a competition she was from Great
Britain
oh we were nice to me and she she became
second runner-up who came Liam first
well who won in the rehearsal no nobody
wins - the rehearsal is not fair there
was this woman and she teaches how to
walk she woman she was really good in it
actually she was a great Miss Universe
everybody was just like looking like
even Steve Harvey I was with him
backstage and she was doing the evening
gown walk and he was like oh my god and
this woman is amazing she's like I had
heard yeah up to now the what was he
like in real life see it was really cool
I liked him a lot and when I was fixed
station we were waiting it was just
really positive and he was like yes
Jesse just remind yourself who you are
and you're amazing what you can do it
and right he was actually really nice
with the girls do you blame him for what
happened no I really don't blame it you
hold a grudge know everybody can make a
mistake
yeah it was just so sad because I saw in
his eyes he was like oh my god oh right
came here I view in the background oh
I'm gonna set that concealer with powder
because we wanted to last all day and
what is your favorite Luke my favorite
look well I look like a softcore Dragway
on a daily basis so I like to pack it
own for me it's all or nothing I either
wear no makeup or a lot of makeup
because I feel like I love the
transformation makeup I don't like just
you know chapstick and mascara it's just
so boring to me but I love the
transformation of it so if I can you
know make myself look totally different
I'm like okay cool today I'm Natasha no

happened to your face where you were
like oh girl yes a beauty tip that will
stick with you forever
well I'm a huge fan of highlighters oh
you've come to the right place
people always ask me what this thing is
I keep this on my pinky so that I when I
lean on the face it doesn't leave an
imprint in the foundation so it just
leaves it looking beautiful yeah we're
going to take Anasazi reveals warm taupe
and we're going to define your crease
just a tiny tiny bit and with a tiny bit
I mean a lot I love my models look down
