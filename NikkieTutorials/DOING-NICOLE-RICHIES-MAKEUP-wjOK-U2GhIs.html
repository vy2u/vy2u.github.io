alone on my channel I am joined by the
legendary the iconic Nicole right I'm so
excited I lost my voice I am so excited
it's an honor that you are here it's an
honor for me I'd be here I grew up with
you so trust me the honor is the girl -
honored today I am joined here by Nicole
Richie and we're playing with a brand
new urban decay product they came out
with the naked petite heat which i think
is very fitting because like there's
nothing petite about me are you on the
other hand everything is petite so this
right here you've seen it I've seen it
what's your favorite shade um I am into
wild thing love the name I love the bold
orange yes you know it's very cool it's
complimentary towards the skin and as
you know I love warm tones so I am so
excited and honored against be doing
your makeup today I am so excited am I
gonna look like you after because that's
the goal you have the most beautiful
face I've ever seen there's a lot of
makeup on here okay is that the goal
I've to look like you yes so with the
honey further ado let's get glammed
together and if you're at home and
you're bored grab the brushes well let's
do it together here we go alright so the
first thing I'm gonna do is so tell me
how did you and Urban Decay meet um I
banged on their door and I slammed it on
my face three times fourth time they let
me in I read that you don't like
highlighter I don't I just don't really
like I'm good with like the brows the
lashes a lipstick you know like a little
color here like I don't know about the
you know there's a lot of I think the
highlighter is like a little advanced
and I'm happy like for you to do it
absolutely I just don't know how to do
it oh gosh so for us to look we're doing
bombshell so it's very blown out very
blended very like no harsh lines and
first of all you have an amazing makeup
artist peculiar today yes I do is a star
Oh Nelson knows what to do with the
brush oh where are you yeah I got you
honey but I got you down Bozek try so
I'm just adding a little bit of
definition to that brow definitely don't
want anything too harsh or insanely
intense now where am I going in this
style makeup everywhere I think it's a
very light casual makeup for grocery
shopping you do know see when it comes
to makeup I love the process of it I
think it's a form of like showing your
art right so this is more of like it's a
canvas you like applying it you're just
trying to just like get it done exactly
we really appreciate okay I like that I
like that perspective so what was your
first sort of memory when it comes to
makeup well my mom loves makeup so I
would sit in her bathroom and watch her
get ready and I was like oh my gosh she
had this drawer and it was all red
lipstick yeah and every time she would
leave she would go out at night
I would like just go her lipstick and
start playing with it like he's so much
fun what do you think is like your
biggest makeup mishap like where did it
go wrong one day is there like one look
where you were like that one I don't
know if I would say that because I feel
like makeup so much fun you know happily
and like different looks just it meet
they mean different things when you do
your own makeup what's your favorite
thing to do like what is your favorite
step okay I'll do it I'll do a brow and
what I do is I take the brow brush yes
and put it in a little brown eye a
little bit Brown shadow yes and then I
just brushed my hairs nope
hairs up with a little shadow hmmm what
do you think so far good good okay yeah
we're on the right path sometimes if I'm
feeling sassy I'll do a little under-eye
concealer just to look awake and then I
just do a little bronzer yes then I do
troublemaker mascara for all my lashes
good good good girl and then I put a
little um lip balm and then I mix it
with the urban decay fuel and it gives
you like a it's like a sheer desert rose
Oh take me there for the naughty rose Oh
rose with thorns oh I'm just going in
with wild thing in your crease to get a
little bit of definition going and I
think one of the the biggest trends on
like in the makeup industry right now is
the warm tones so one thing is right up
the valley so the trick is and I always
see a lot of girls do this is when they
do their eye shadow they go I'm doing my
own shadow
oh my god and they get too excited and
they open their eyes no but like they
they pull their eyebrows up constantly
so they're like oh my god I'm doing this
I'm doing this and then when they're
done
oh god I'm done and they didn't get a
whole part of that exactly so calm down
calm down
and you want to look where you need it
can I
try a little right there okay so it's
just the tip mm-hmm and then am i
starting here right here I like most
like strength to be on the outer corner
here so that's where I start and if you
are feeling a little frisky yes try
circular motions little ones so little
circles Oh
blending for you okay and then you know
that's the thing like how do you know
it's blended by the way this I could do
every day because that's like it's easy
this is easy oh my god you taught me
everything take that bow yeah soft
circle motions do the work for you like
brushing your teeth in your crease
exactly what I definitely loved when it
comes to like playing with makeup is
every step could be a look so you put it
here in the outer corners apply some
mascara done right like I could do this
a little mascara and then leave but you
can also add more and then that is a
look and then you could add more and
that is a look so it never ends you ever
ventured out into the pack of eyeliner
you know what
it's my one trick I'm really good at a
cat eye do you remember the scene in
neverending story
when he's crossing the gates and if you
doubt yourself at all the two eyes shoot
laser beams at you and your body
explodes it's eyeliner at 10 a.m.
that is what liquid eyeliner
focus on the national nice and smoky are
using a little bit of heist a little bit
of high school Ashley
nice and I like how your voice drops an
octave right when you I can tell like
you're really happy when the octave
changes okay and like I like that
because then I know I'm like we went
somewhat shion in yeah okay dumb
question but I have to ask did you play
basketball
no okay volleyball no you modeled
obviously no too tall
you didn't model no but nothing with the
height nothing with the height well you
can get everything in your closet that
must be nice I don't know how that feels
okay let's focus on that lower lash line
this is right now we are using heist
again now question is your real name
Nicole no what is it
Vicky no yes I only know one other
person that's real name is Nikki I went
by Nikki as a kid
well my gardening and rap name is Nikki

regard but that's just like on a
professional level

you're scared you ready to glow okay so
the highlighter goes right well you see
it happening already in the mirror you

want to intensify that oh is this my
natural Sheen yep right there we're just
gonna I've never touched that part of my
face before I'm realizing I'm glad I
took that virginity of that part

doesn't have to be wild and it could be
but it could be mm-hmm
