hey guys so today I'm doing another The
Vampire Diaries makeup video um as you
know I love The Vampire Diaries I
friggin doriot and now with the wolves
coming in town it's getting even better
so I don't know if you noticed but um
today I'm doing a dead vampire look and
it sounds so stupid because vampires are
dead
but I need the process when they get
staked through the heart or something um
this is this is an honor of my favorite
character of the entire season entire
series actually Lexie she got killed by
Damon um and since day one did I did
make up videos for the vampire diaries
everyone told me I look like her I don't
see it so yeah today I am showing you
how to be a dead vampire with like the
veins through their entire skin I still
want to be on the show you know me and
adit empire diary Chloe on Twitter a
couple of months ago we were talking
about it and we have the perfect role
for me like um I'm Lexi sister and I
come in town to uh see you kill Damon um
so yeah if you are interested in seeing
how I uh got killed then please keep on
watching so I basically have no idea how
to do the skin so I'm just gonna
experiment and stuff um yeah so it's
gonna dry something so I'm going to take
some of my lightest foundation that I
own and this is true match by L'Oreal
this is number c1 and I'm going to mix
that with a little bit of white face
paint this is face I'm Pro and then just
make it um as light as you want just to
look dead I'm just gonna
take some of that foundation and put it
on my face and just the white end the
skin out and then once it's on anything
gets still way too dark you can just
take some of the white base bang and
make it even lighter that's how I'm
gonna do it I look so pretty right now
and not really I'm Nikki are so fabulous
right now darlin onset is on I'm going
to set it with a powder this is
kryolan's um transparent powder all
right and with a sigma uh f25 i'm
applying that to the face oh I feel so
sexy I could pose for Playboy right now
yes I could but I wouldn't because you
have no would never call me okay um
let's contour the crap out of our face
right now and the colors I'm going to be
contouring with our my X taupe blush and
a little bit of Max Prince
so you basically won't like topi gray
colors and just contour a bitch to make
you look like sunken in and dead you can
always take a kabuki and soften it if
you think it's too much I'm not actually
gonna darken it up with um mix per inch
eyes shadow and keep that more unlike
the sides right here because you want
the deepest to be here and not right
here because then you have a weird spot
on your face now for the eyes I'm
actually going to pop some powder on top
of them to UM fight creasing um if you
are going to wear this like Halloween or
something
or I don't know where um you might put a
bass under your eyes to prevent the
eyeshadow from creasing I'm gonna go
into because I'm watching this off right
after this of course all the vampire
girls have nice makeup on but when they
die it's not like the makeup was gone
all of a sudden so you kind of want to
do like um girly makeup but dead I'm
going to take next I shadow and sketch
and I'm going to apply that first to
darken up my circles under my eyes
darken it up you're dead it's okay
okay now they're the same but go into
the inner corners right here and this
will make it look like your eyes are
really sunken in so go into the corner
right here and make it look sunken in
and dead then with max Swiss chocolate
I'm actually going to put a little bit
of a crease in my eyes and blend it with
the sketch then I'm actually putting a
nice shimmery eyeshadow on my lids
because as I said they don't decide with
our makeup on they die with makeup on so
I'm actually putting some shimmer enos
on my wallets because I died with it
make it a little bit darker where you
need to so now I'm actually going to
apply some mascara and eyeliner to my
waterline to make it look nice and girly
if I do that that's even worse and then
we're going to add the things to our
skin when they die normally they come
out of their eyes because they're hungry
but now they are in their skin to start
that but apply them with my Mac 266 and
I'm just gonna play with sketch okay so
with Lexi they came right out of her
neck and went up to her face so I'm
going to try and do that
um go ahead and make your lips as light
and gray as you want I'm going to go
pretty far with it of course um
when it's Halloween or you're going to
like the death depend higher diaries
like party or something you want to do
your whole body I just did my face so
you can see what you kind of need to do
um so yeah um I hope you enjoyed this
video I hope you'll learn something from
it and um I look so weird hopefully I
will see you guys next time I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
