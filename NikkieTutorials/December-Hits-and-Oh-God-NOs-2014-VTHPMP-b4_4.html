it feels to be back on the youtubes it
has been two weeks and I don't think
I've gone away for almost two weeks in
my entire almost seven year youtube
career right now I don't think I've ever
done that and I don't ever plan on doing
it again because I have missed you guys
so much
I am little like no I have missed
you so bad after winter one year week I
kind of had to take a break and as much
as I love to do in winter wonder week I
was working five days till 5:00 a.m. in
the morning and that is not how one can
live I became so tired I had no
attention for my boyfriend for my family
friends was it was just waking up
filming editing and sleeping and
uploading of course so I absolutely love
to do in winter wonder week I just have
to when I do it this year because it's
2015 now I'm gonna have to plan and pre
film a lot better
other than that happy new year I hope
your new year's eve was amazing it
definitely was better than my because I
got sick right after Christmas and just
not say I got the hardcore flu not the
like little like softcore flu were you
like I'm sick this was like the hardcore
flu that I started to burring my entire
body was cold at one point my nails and
my lips turned blue because I was so
cold and I got hardcore flu in men's
head ache worst headache in my life ever
got the worst cold ever but I survived
quickly I want to remind you guys that
please vote for my mom's webshop she's
been nominated in Holland for webshop of
the year
and after my last video where I asked
you guys to vote for her she came in
first and now other people also did
their promos and now we're on the third
place so how awesome would it be if we
would make my mom win webshop of the
year for Holland so I will put the link
down below where you can vote please
vote for her please please please blues
blues blues so if you have some spare
time and you want to vote for my mom for
webshop of the year please do she would
truly
appreciate it I would appreciate it and
that will be awesome she's in third now
let's make her first so what I further
adieu let's get to some hits
so my first hit this month are my nails
I gave in I did it I've always seen
dusty and crispy and all these other
gurus rocked their hand shots with fake
nails and I always loved to pose with my
hands in my faith to know be all fancy
and but no nails and I looked Brad
 and I talked to destiny she talked
me into it and I I couldn't be more
grateful and thankful because I love
these damn nails I went for a little
longer and pointy err look and I got
them done at Universal nails in
Amsterdam which is in my opinion the
best nail salon Holland could ever wish
for they have five salons all in
Amsterdam the field the idea behind
these meals where I wanted nails to make
my fingers look more elegant and
elongated so I told my girl Kim at
Universal that I wanted them to be
longer more elongated more feminine and
nude so we went for this amazing mixed
Coco nude color and then at the base of
the nail our gold rhinestones and then
at the tip of the nails there are golden
glitters so I am super duper in love and
the thing is that whatever I pick up it
could be like a sandwich it could be
like toilet paper I look at my nails and
I go oh this could be a perfect product
shot because I always do like the
product shops for my videos like this I
go out of out of the frame and then crop
this in and then I have a product shot
and whatever I pick up nowadays I'm like
goddamn that's a good product shot I am
totally on the on the nails boat and I
love it next product I want to talk
about is an eyelash glue I never thought
the day would come that an eyelash glue
would be in my favorites videos this is
the house of lashes eyelash glue and
wear has has been all my life eyelashes
and I always kind of had the struggle
whereas at first I just didn't know how
to apply them then I trained myself
into knowing how to applying them in the
best way and I did a video on it and
still every now and then I would totally
fudge up and it would just look like
crap and it would just go everywhere not
lift up I would be like gia Gunn with
one hanging eyelash and went up so I was
like this is not right and I quickly
gave the problem to duo eyelash adhesive
because I'm sorry I'm gonna say it duo
eyelash adhesive sucks balls everyone's
like oh yeah just put the duo eyelash
glue on let it set let's get tacky for
like two two seconds I have waited a
freaking day for it to get tacky and it
would not get tacky however with the
House of lashes eyelash glue you pop it
on it actually has a brush which is
fan-freaking-tastic the applicator is a
brush so this is a brush and then you
brush it onto the base of the eyelashes
this gets tacky in ten seconds I am
not kidding you when you apply the glue
to the base of the lashes and you count
to ten it's tacky and ready to go
even when it's not that tacky and you
pop it on to the eye it will get tacky
there really really quick like snap snap
snap tacky and I love that because once
I place that lash on I wanted to grab on
to the skin and I want to poke it into
the right direction and be done with it
don't think about it anymore just done
over done and with the House of lashes
eyelash glue I can just pop it on the
base of my lashes pop it onto the eyes
and call it a day plus this is one of
the strongest eyelash glues I have ever
tried it stays on so so so you can cry
in this and it will stay on next
favorite is by makeup studio and this is
the translucent powder extra flying in
number this is a big ol pot this is
number one and my mom used to have a
webshop called head cosmetic eyes NL
where she sold makeup studio but they
quit using that webshop because my mom
wanted to start another webshop that
she's been nominated for for up ship of
the year now and so we have all this
makeup studio stuff downstairs that is
not going anywhere so I was like we can
you know put it in my room and I can
like do stuff with it and I saw this big
old pot of turn
listen powder number one why have I only
found out about this just now because it
is amazing it is definitely one of the
best face powders I have ever used
because I can actually do the cooking or
baking method that I'll be drag queens
do they all do the contour and then put
light powder underneath and let it set
let it cook let it bake I could never do
that because I could never find a powder
that was light enough for my skin but
still wasn't white
so with this powder this is a great
powder to matching your face to make it
all look match and perfect and set your
foundation but you can also take a gun
clutch it of this pack it on as the
baking shaping technique and you K let
it stick and it works Plus these also
come in darker color so that's great for
if you have a darker skin tone another
powder I've been loving is by Laura
Mercier and this is a secret brightening
powder and I've heard lots and lots of
great things about this so I got it
about two weeks ago and I use it to set
my concealer underneath my eyes and just
like this you're like well what can be
so special about a damn powder if you're
looking at it like this not so damn much
but if you take a photograph of yourself
with flash oh mama
in a flash photography it just really
lightly lightens up the area underneath
your eyes or wherever you apply it and
it just makes you look so photoshopped
and so airbrushed and amazing and in
flash photography it just makes your
dark circles be gone with the wind'
and I love this powder it's great for
setting concealer underneath the eyes a
primer I've been loving and I also got
because of Jesse Perkins here on YouTube
is the Tarte a clean slate timeless
smoothing primer and this is one of
those primers that come in a pot and are
very silicon e and it's very velvety and
what I love doing with it is what I
apply my moisturizer or whatever primer
I used to moisturize with I take this
and go over top over the areas that I
want to a blur out my pores a little bit
plus where I think my makeup will get
sweaty first oily shiny first and this
definitely has been helping keeping my
makeup on for the entire day and it's
great because a blur
those pores and pictures and in real
life a little bit and it's just a great
primer and it it works it really works
it's a great private a blush I've been
loving is by Milani and this is the
baked blush in Luminoso such a stunning
color I'm wearing it on the episode my
cheeks a day and it's a very nice peachy
um it's actually like a true peach color
like a shimmering illuminating peach
with a golden shine that once you apply
it to the cheeks it makes everyone and
anyone look really glowy and fresh and
awake it's just one of those blushes
that you don't have to think about you
pop it on and you look good
so and it's drugstore drugstore
my next favorite Elsa is by Tarte this
is the tartlet eyeshadow palette this
has quickly become one of my all-time
favorite eyeshadow palettes of life
because it has all the nude shades you
can wish for because once we look at it
we're going to look at it it has your
highlighting shades which come in a
yellow tone pink tone and neutral tone
it has your transition shades which come
in a neutral a more mathy color and a
more brown yellow color then it's got
your darker colors we've got a more
neutral color again a more purpley love
color and again a taupe a dark gray
taupe and then we got the most amazing
black ever a dark dark purple and a dark
dark brown so it's really geared towards
suiting every skin tone whatever you
like this palette has it I love this
palette I've only used it for a month
and in that month I already know that
it's going to be featured in my 2014
favorites video some other shadows I've
been totally obsessing over are the
makeup geek foiled eyeshadows I did a
full review video on this during winter
one a week so if you haven't seen that
video please do check it out I talked in
depth about every single color and what
I think of them but these shadows are
absolutely insane and I have three
favorites this month three favorite
colors that I've been wearing all month
well not all month but a lot and on one
definitely is in the spotlight and then
grandstand
and then flamethrower so these three
right here are my top three favorites of
the foiled eyeshadows but especially in
the spotlight my number one because it's
mutual but it still has that shimmer and
that foiled Ness so that makes it like a
natural chrome color on crack then last
but not least are the Kat Von D
everlasting liquid lipsticks brands have
been coming out with liquid lipsticks
which are lipsticks that apply like a
gloss like a very very pigmented gloss
and they dry into a matte formula so
every brand has been doing these and my
favorite brand so far is Kat Von D so
I'm wearing a liquid lipstick by
Katherine D today actually this is
Lolita and this color has been crazy
because everyone and their mama has been
ordering this and wearing this on
Sephora it's sold out constantly so I
was just browsing Sephora the other
night and I saw that was back in stock
so I immediately placed an order and
this is Lolita this is such a trendy
color right now so I feel very on-trend
and the other colors I really like our
outlaw and Vampira and vabir especially
it's I mean it's a dark dark red which
is you got me when you're a dark dark
red so that's it for my hits for the
month of December now let's go on to the
okay oh yeah No
so my one and only oh god no for the
month of December is by cover FX and I
know cover FX is a very well-loved brand
and I love cover FX I have a couple of
products by them that I absolutely adore
so I got the total cover cream
foundation in and 10 and first of all it
applies beautifully so I applied it with
my Sigma X 88 and on first like at the
first like in the beginning it looked
stunning it gives great great coverage
it like covers everything but it still
makes your skin look like skin and it
was it we were just so off to just a
great start we were off to a great start
but then during the day I didn't have a
mirror around me or nor did I have
somewhere to look into see my face and
then four or five hours later
I went to a toilets and there was a
mirror and I saw that it seeped into all
the little fun lines in my face it
emphasized all the dry parts of my face
it seeped into fine lines around my eyes
in my smiling lines this is a bad one on
the side of the nose it just totally
gunked up and became dirty and as much
as I love how this looks in the
beginning it's just it doesn't last I
don't hate it I don't love it
it looks great at first but it doesn't
last that's all I'm saying
oh and how could I forget this Michael
Kors sexy amber perfume has been my
favorite scent this month it is so good
