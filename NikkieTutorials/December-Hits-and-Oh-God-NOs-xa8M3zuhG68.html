show you my last hits and a God knows
for 2013 it is December 31st it is time
for my hits I know God knows I can't
believe what this year has brought me
what this year has done for me so if you
want to know what my biggest highlights
work for 2013 then please go to my blog
and me get tutorials calm because I just
posted a full on blog with my biggest
highlights of the year and then all
mixed with an Instagram picture so I I
like that and of course if you want to
know more about what I thought of this
year then please watch my resolutions
tag I came up with an entire tag sort of
reflecting on this year and looking
forward to 2014 so check it out and if
you want to do it do it but other than
that today will be the last hits Anna
God knows for 2013 I'm so excited for
the new year and let's go so my first
hit for this month is something I've
been wanting to try out for ages and I
finally got it I went to a nova with one
of my best friends and I went to a store
that will soon be gone sadly because I
just figured out that it even exists
they got Yankee Candles I'm a sucker for
scented candles so when I saw that they
had Yankee Candles I I just almost
dropped to the floor in that store and
the one I picked up it's a snowflake
cookie and you got this smells like a
portal to heaven like this little pot of
magic is like a portal to heaven and out
comes the scent that heaven must smell
like I cannot I cannot I cannot I can I
cannot another huge favorite this month
is the lorac unzipped palette when the
Naked 3 came out you all know I'm not a
naked naked person whatsoever I was like
no I'm not getting the Naked 3 I'm
getting the lorac unzipped palette the
lorac unzipped palette comes with the
most gorgeous rosy bronzy warm neutral
tones it's so stunning I'm wearing it on
my eyes today it has the perfect
highlighting colors it has two perfect
lid colors like shimmery
the shiny goodnesses and they have met
crease colors and dark crease colors and
lash line colors and this palette
it might be my favorite palette of 2013
it might knock my fees are pellet away
another pellet I've been loving is my
Smashbox and this is called the Wonder
vision palette in Sparks and the texture
of these are out of this world they feel
like butter it comes with three high
shine colors and three somewhat more
matte colors and it's just the perfect
mix of chrome and met and wearable and
bronze and dark and pretty something
that's not expensive and super duper
awesome is by essence caught the metal
glam highlighter powder in gold digger I
went to the drugstores a couple of days
ago here in Holland and I bumped into
essence this time I saw the medical and
highlighter powder and it is I mean it
is I believe only three euros and it is
the most gorgeous light shimmering
champagne color I'm wearing it as a
highlighter on my face today on my nose
I'm cheekbones just the globe that you
see in my face today is all thanks to
this I never knew that drugstore brands
could make such pretty highlighters
because it feels like butter it applies
like butter it just it blends out so
nicely and it's just so gorgeous and I'm
so glad that I have this another thing
that's not expensive is by Catrice
cosmetics and this is the prime and fine
translucent powder and I use this to set
the concealer under my eyes and it is so
good it's the perfect substitute for the
Mac finishing setting powder Mac has a
really loose finely milled powder that
you can use under your eyes or just all
over the face and this curfews cosmetics
prime and fine translucent powder is
just like that is just like that make up
forever powder of the Mac powder but
just this is I believe 4 euros ok next
is a nail polish and I've been loving
this new brand for me I haven't tried
anything from this brand ever before
this is called the new black
especially the demi lovato
collection I got and it's hot so could
this nail polish set is called Safari
and you have a glimmering shimmering
glittering black you have a hunter green
a foil silver a cream white which is on
my nails as well and this sort of gold
green silver topper glitter coder
especially these two together the whites
and the glitter topper coat are amazing
and then this set right here is called
the new black of Demi Lovato collection
in stylized and it comes with a cream
black polish a nice white cream color
and then also gold studs I posted a
picture on Instagram a couple of days
ago with me wearing a manicure that is
this white color cream white color and
then with gold studs in the middle and
haha I absolutely love how crisp and
clean it's still edgy this looks so odd
the new black stylized
and Safari nail polish sets are awesome
to take no polish off this month I've
been loving the OPI expert touch lacquer
remover I've always been a huge fan of
these Zoya plus remover something like
that the purple remover from Zoya I love
that so much but it's so hard to get
that to Holland so then I found this OPI
lacquer remover and it's basically the
same it takes your polish off in just
seconds you only need a little bit and
then you just let it soak for a bit and
then wipe it off your nail polish is
gone also I've been getting some
comments on my latest Beyonce tutorial
that my lashes seemed to be growing yes
they are I did a full blog post pre
review on the revita lash advance
eyelash serum I talked about it in my
last hit synagogue rose for November and
that is when I started using it like a
week or two and we're like a month and
somewhat further now and my lashes are
longer but for me they are so like look
at that look at that look at that last
but not least our shoes I I had shoes in
my last thumbnail for my Hudson oh god
no
for November but I cut that out because
the video was getting too long and I
think this video is getting too long as
well but uh okay these are biker boots
well glitter on them well not really
glitter it's more like little rhinestone
studs
um I love these these remind me so much
of Michonne from the walking dead
of course Michonne has the biker boots
with this sort of flap tin and I don't
care steel when I wear these I feel like
Michonne I feel like you can take all
the zombies when I wear these I feel
like a fabulous zombie slayer and the
best thing is these were only 35 euros
and I got them at a fun hata
here in Holland and I believe you have
it in Germany too but in Germany it's
called diced mutton that's it for bits
and let's go to the Oh God knows oh yeah
no I only have one Oh God not this month
but I'm not sure if it's actually in oh
god no it's not necessarily the the
brand or what I'm showing you in just a
couple of seconds but primers foundation
primers I used to put them on
religiously back in the day because I
felt like I have to put primer on
because then my foundation stays on
longer and I quit using primers
altogether for about two three months
now and then I got the Smashbox photo
finish foundation primer alights a
couple of days ago and it's it's not
necessarily Smashbox or Make Up For Ever
or the Mac prep and prime it's just all
primers altogether I feel like they're
not working anymore
maybe I've gotten immune to them maybe
it just doesn't work on my skin anymore
but it feel like when I used the primer
before I apply my foundation or a
concealer or whatever I just feel like
it goes off quicker for now my love for
foundation primers and then also the
Smashbox and the makeup forever and the
prep and prime it's just gone and that's
it that is my last video for 2013 what a
