lovato
VMAs 2011 tutorial damn you looked
absolutely amazing like in her silver
dress with her perfect silver glittery
eyes and her beautiful nude lips I
absolutely loved it so if you want to
know how I got this like really
glamorous party look then please keep on
watching okay so if you're wearing this
to a party or let's say a red-carpet
event you want to apply a eye base to
prevent your eyeshadow from creasing now
you can use a Paint Pot from Meg or
anything you like but the one I'm going
to use is this Makeup Forever aqua cream
in number two which is called steal if
I'm right and this is just a perfect
color to apply as a base you give all
those silvery colors a pop so I'm just
going to take my ring finger and Pat it
onto my lid okay so now I'm going to mix
two eyeshadow colors from MEK this is
Elektra and this is copper play now I
find Elektra a little bit too shimmery
for this look so I'm gonna Matan it down
with copper plate and make it like a
more greyish color and I'm just gonna
apply that to the lid on top of that
base that we just applied you don't have
to apply anything to the outer corners
just the inner corners and the half of
the lid now with next mystery I'm just
gonna add a little bit of definition
into the outer part of my eye so I'm
just gonna brush some of the mystery on
that outer corner right here and then
blend it into the crease a bit just like
halfway in and then I'm just gonna take
another brush and put it on the outer
corners of my eye and blend it in
and then just take another blending
brush and just blend it out until you
like it
okay then I'm going to take Elektra and
copperplate again and the pie those two
the middle of my lower lid
okay so Demi had a really small winged
eyeliner on so I'm exactly gonna do that
I'm gonna take this Inglot waterproof
AMC eyeliner gel matte in number 77
which is black and this is the most
waterproof gel eyeliner I have ever had
in my life
okay so now I'm going to apply some
waterproof black eyeliner to my
waterline and the one I'm using is this
Urban Decay 24/7 glide-on eye pencil
okay so one of the things that makes
this book pop so much is the silver
inner corners for that I'm going to use
a sparkly one because I know it's a
party and you want to Sparkle like
Edward Cullen the one I'm using is my
favorite silver glitter this is makeup
studios jewel effects and shine and I'm
just going to apply some to the inner
corners of my eye okay what I'm now
going to do is curl my lashes with my
Japan s eyelash curler and apply some
mascara you can go waterproof but I'm
washing this off of right after this
because it's the late at night but I'm
using my makeup studio maximum Volume
Mascara
I'm gonna apply some lashes which I
don't have any clue which number they
are but I know they're max and just cut
them in half and apply them on top of
each other and that will make them like
corner lashes because Demi had them
really like wispy at the end or like
like flowy like going out at the I don't
know um so I'm gonna do I wasn't right
now and then it will be back for
envelops so what I'm gonna do is take
this Catrice ultimate color be natural
lipstick which looks like that and I'm
gonna put that onto my lips because it
is really really nude but it's also sort
of peachy orange okay so then you can
leave them like this because this
lipstick already is really shiny but
Demi were a little S on top of it as
well the one I'm using is this NARS lip
gloss called strip tease and I'm just
gonna put that on the middle okay guys
so that completes this Demi Lovato VMAs
2011 or 2011 because people will kill me
if I say end um so yeah I hope you guys
enjoyed this I hope you learned
something from it for a Christmas leave
