on a demi lovato picture that got
tweeted to my account it was like love
at first sight I absolutely loved the
makeup but then I started like taking a
closer look and it actually looks kind
of photoshopped and I'm not really sure
if this is real because I searched for
like Demi Lovato and green makeup and
everything and she had like really
yellow hair in the picture nothing just
nothing like it never happened
so I don't know if this photo is real or
if it is photoshopped I don't care the
makeup is stunning and I'm here today to
recreate that picture so yeah this is
the look and if you want to know how to
get it then please keep on watching
boo-ki normal so it's always the first
thing you want to do it's a pie based
first and I'm using my Mac soft ochre
Paint Pot so the first eyeshadow will be
using it's my makeup geek and this is
called bitten Tecton mad Wallach I bet
you in your face because I had bath salt
no it's not true and with this just
start defining your crease of it and I'm
going all the way in just because this
looks best with my eye shape you don't
have to do this I repeat you don't have
to do this now I'm gonna take Mac's and
bark and fully eyeshadows and with this
define your lower lash line mainly on
the outer part don't go all the way in
and then with that also follow that up
until the crease from there blend it
into the crease to make it one sort of
piece I'm going to blend it out using
Mac's kid eyeshadow and again that
makeup geek bitten button button why do
I keep repeating bitten better and with
this just start blending this out and
sort of give it a nice
Heys okay now I'm just gonna deepen that
crease up quite a lot easing Foley and
bitten together and just darken that and
blended up a bit and then also brush
some of the dark warm Brown onto this
very outer part right here and then with
a really fluffy brush give that an even
softer blend okay taking my Lily skin
fix powder with that I'm gonna highlight
my brow bone and with this it's also the
time to kind of form your eye shadow
shape so with this I'm kind of gonna
give it the shape that I want it to be
and then after that of course you can
blend it in again the darker colors and
give it a seamless blend now I'm gonna
take mixed quite natural Paint Pot and
go ahead and apply this all over the lid
reaching up until the crease and then
I'm gonna go over that with a little bit
of Mac's humid eyeshadow simply Pat this
over the quite natural Paint Pot and
again going up until the crease then
just go ahead and give this all a really
nice blend on top for the waterline i
will be using Mac's
minted eye Kohl and then with this also
go on your lower lash line a bit and
kind of meet it with the brown and then
also fill up this inner corner right
here and then with the q-tip kind of
blend it out and make it look softer and
then with sugar pills Midori I'm going
over that and then I'm gonna take a
little bit of this color star liquid
eyeliner in a waterproof version and
this is
number 24 and this is the perfect green
color I love this green go over the
Midori by sugarpill that you just
applied and that really gets that green
like an amazing sort of glow oh my god
oh my god anyways oh my okay where
was I for the inner corner I'm gonna
take max dazzle light and just highlight
the inner corners with that and kind of
plays this next to the green here and
then just blend it out although this
left to do now is smoke out the upper
lashline with a some black to hide the
band off the fall flashes and furthest
that will be using my makeup geek
corrupt eyeshadow and then just apply
like an eyeliner and then blend it out
okay then now it's time for the mascara
and of course false lashes because demi
lovato is a false lash fanatic so fer
mascara we'll be using my trusty old
makeup studio waterproof 3d extra black
after that makeup studio mascara I'm
gonna use a Kiko mascara as ah and this
is the volume eyes mascara and then for
lashes I'm again going for four for the
Laura lashes and these are the strike a
pose darling strike a pose
okay so prior to filming I already dip
my cheeks I like my entire face but like
after dropping like an entire pot of
green eyeshadow on it it's not really
there anymore
what is still on is my contour and I
contoured with my NYX blush in taupe I
warmed up my face using my Mac of
refined golden bronzing powder I'm
actually gonna add like the tiniest
tiniest a bit more because well like
half of it is gone now for blush I
actually used to this is number one this
is pinch Oh peach and this is called
style both might Mac so that is AMA
cheeks I'm actually gonna more and for
my highlight I of course used my Mac
vanilla pigment okay for lips Demi was
wearing a really nice sort of like
bitten sort of glossy color the Bourjois
color boost glossy finish lipstick and
the name name is soon to be revealed
this is the bourgeois color boost glossy
finish lipstick in number four peach on
the beach
and then everybody completes my demi
lovato may be photoshopped may be real
