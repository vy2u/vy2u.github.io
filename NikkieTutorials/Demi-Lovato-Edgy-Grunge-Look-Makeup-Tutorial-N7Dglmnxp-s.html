inspired tutorial a couple of days ago
on my Facebook fan page someone asked me
to do a look inspired by one Demi Lovato
picture that she send me and I fell in
love she had these really dark brows
dark lips but she was wearing sunglasses
certif like this and then she sort of
went like hey girl so I kind of did my
own spin on the eyes I must say I really
really like this look so um if you want
to know how to do this demi lovato
inspired trendy golf edgy look then
please keep on watching okay so for the
brows I'm first going to prime them with
my Too Faced shadow insurance then with
the spoolie brush all your hairs down
the colors that we'll be using for my
brows are run by Mac and we're going
even more extreme with a little bit of
carbon and all I'm going to do first is
make a line at the top of my brow going
towards the highest point so the arch
then go ahead and make that arch and
extend your brow take our spoolie again
and brush all the hairs up and now go
ahead and define the bottom and then
matching up at that tail that you've
just made
now with Brun only go further into your
brow to the front now I'm going to fill
this up with carbon and run and then
just stop right there for now
now I'm going to take run only and with
that I'm kinda gonna go further into my
brow with really subtle movements you
don't want to like make a harsh line
right here and then go back and back and
back and back no you want to work really
gentle taking my spoolie again and I'm
going to brush the front up and down a
bit just to make the front a little bit
more soft and wearable as far as you can
call this variable of course now I'm
going to run some brow gel through my
hairs this one is a clear one by makeup
studio and this is a really good one
because it really makes your hairs stay
put the entire day and not to get the
perfect shape I'm going to run some
concealer underneath just to get the
perfect line and this is next studio
finish concealer in NC 15
and I'm also going to run some right
there for the eyelids of course the
first thing I'm going to do is apply a
base to prevent the eyeshadows from
creasing and I'm using my Mac soft ochre
Paint Pot so I'm first going to define
my crease a bit with Mac's corduroy
eyeshadow and I'm actually going to take
my favorite illamasqua contouring blush
this is disobey and I'm gonna use this
as my blending crease color so just run
disobey over corduroy and further into
your socket your crease no I always
wanted to say sake I know I did
now just blend that out until it's nice
and soft and I'm actually going to
extend it a bit towards the end of my
brow just really really slightly a
really subtle read Arden a my crease
with a little bit of corduroy again for
my eyelids I will be using this mimimi I
shadow quad in goddess eyes number two
and I'm going to mix the two top colours
together for my lid for my outer corner
and lower lash line I'm going to use
mystery by Mac and I'm going to mix it
with that mimimi quad again and taking
the darkest shimmery color and those two
are going right here at that corner
and then also towards the crease and
that outer third right here and then
over that I'm going to run a bit of the
disobey Illamasqua blush again for a
nice sort of okra yellow haze around the
eyes my lower lash line I'm going to use
this NYX slide-on pencil in golden
bronze and just run that along the
middle of your lower lash line and then
over that I'm going to apply some Mac
ember lights
for my inner corner I will be using this
makeup studio dual effect in shine and
for my waterline I'm using that NYX
slide on golden bronze pencil again for
my mascara I'm using my trusty old
makeup studio waterproof 3d extra black
mascara and for my lashes I'm going to
use the Miss adoro number 42 they're
really long and really kind of um
separated so you get those really nice
defined lashes and I love that and she's
been wearing that a lot as well so I'm
not by my lashes right now and then I
will be back for the lips I lied before
we go to the lips I'm going to show you
what is on my cheeks I first started
contouring with my NYX blush taupe then
to warm and bronze up my face a little
bit more I use my Illamasqua disobey
blush the same we use for the crease
then for the actual blush I use my
favorite Mac pink tea I used two
different highlighters for the top of my
cheekbones number one is duly shitlord
the first is this girl and Misiones
cruel gardenia highlighting powder
really pretty like oh my god so gorgeous
and then to make it a little bit more
gold I went to my extra dimension skin
finish from Mac called whisper of guilt
I'm like pinching down to fit in the
camera for the lips you have to know
that there's a huge filter on Denny's
photo so in real life I think I'm
looking at the picture right now your
lips were just a darker more purpley red
color but I'm actually going to try to
recreate the lips from the actual
picture with the filter on top I'm first
going to line and blend my lips with um
current the lip pencil by Mac which is a
dark purple --red then on top of like
the edges like the outside of my lip I'm
going to use Prince noir by Mac this is
my favorite dark dark red color for on
the middle of my lid lip lip I'm going
to use Mac's
runaway red so I'm going to make sort of
like an ombre type of lip there goes
okay it's a sort of like that now I'm
going to take Prince Noir and do the
edges then take run away red and put
that in the middle okay what you now
want to do is just take your colors
reapply them and blend like crazy and
then with concealer and the concealer
I'm going to use is by OCC just clean up
the edges and make it look crisp and
clean and perfect and that ladies and
gents completes his demi lovato um sort
of edgy goth inspired look I just take
your sunglasses just take your iPhone
and then just kind of go like done so
