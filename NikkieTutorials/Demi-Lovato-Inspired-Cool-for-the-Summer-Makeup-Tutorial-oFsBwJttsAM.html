on the black smokey look that demi
lovato was wearing in her new music
video cooler to summer which in my
opinion is the summer anthem of 2015 the
entire music video is so sexy and Amy's
makeup is on point and I think she's
never looked better so that is the look
that I'm doing for you today if you
would like to know how to get this demi
lovato black smokey eyes makeup look
then keep on watching so the first thing
I'll be doing of course is priming and
today I will not be going in with my
aftershave balm my Nivea I'm actually a
little bit more dry today and when I'm a
little bit more dry I like going for the
Cetaphil and this is the hydration
lotion a subscriber here on my channel
recommended this to me if you have dry
skin this also has glycerin as its
second ingredient and glycerin make
stuff stick to it so if you use this as
your base your makeup will really stick
on to the closer in making it stay on
all day so instead of my aftershave balm
I'm going to use this because I'm a
little bit more dry just as with the
aftershave balm I do like to follow
through with my Smashbox primer water
for foundation today I'm going to go in
with my Born This Way Foundation by Too
Faced and this is in the color ivory and
of course I cannot go without my dearest
Cogan doe aqua foundation in to 13 so
I'll be making a mixture of these two
right here and that will be my
foundation and I'm applying this using
my morphe 6 brush
for my concealer at first going to
correct I'm going to use my mac studio
finish correct and conceal in pale pink
and pale yellow
and then going over top with my Urban
Decay Naked skin concealer in fair
neutral and working that in with my Real
Techniques sponge
and setting that with powder to prevent
everything from creasing so for the eyes
the first thing you want to do is prime
them of course because we're going to
work with black eye shadows and that is
one of the hardest looks to do and for
this I'm going to use my Mac soft ochre
Paint Pot and I'm applying it with a
zueva 142 concealer buffer brush then to
make the blending and decrease way
easier I'm going to take this Bobbi
Brown ivory eyeshadow and I'm setting
the soft ochre Paint Pot from my crease
up to my brow bone and this will just
help blend all the eyeshadows that we
put over top way easier as you may have
noticed I still have some powder
underneath my eyes and I'm doing this so
that whatever dark color falls down as
fallout I can brush away right after so
this way you will not have any fallout
at the end of the look for my crease at
first going in with these two shades
from the morphe 35n palette and with a
morphe m4 12 I'm just blending that in
and for a black smokey eye look it's
extremely important to have a blending
transition color in your crease because
if you don't lending will become so
harsh and so unattractive it will become
so wrong so having that blending
transition color in the crease will
really make this look a lot more
wearable and easy to do from that same
palette of mixing these two colors right
here and this is also going in the
crease just to darken it up and with
AJAX beauty line number seven brush I'm
just buffing that in
and to really blend those edges just
take that first brush you use with the
first to blending shades and just wiggle
back and forth between the lines and it
will soften it and blend it out form a
lid I'm going to use Natasha de nonne s
blackest black matte eyeshadow and I'm
going to pack this on using a Mac 242
and with a makeup geek defined crease
brush I'm just blending the edges into
the brown once you're done doing the top
portion you can take away all this
powder and remove the fallout prevent
lower lash line I'm again going in with
that Natasha Danone a blackest black
eyeshadow and I'm just smoking the black
into the roots of my lower lashes then
with my Mac 213 in a soft brown color
I'm just blending and smoking that out
and the for some shine on the inner
corners I'm taking this color pop
Liberty super shock shadow
to finish off I'm gonna apply some
mascara and falsies and the falsies of
using today are by Hooda beauty and
these are the mink lashes in Naomi
okay four cheeks I think it's an
understatement when I say demi was glowy
and bronzy like her makeup artist went
all out on the cheeks so first I'm going
to warm up my skin because I definitely
need a lot of bronzer to mimic her
bronzed eNOS so I'm going to mix two I'm
going to use the Tarte Park F princess
bronzer right here and then to warm it
up a little bit more my give me Sun wear
light skin finish by Mac draw a line
bronze little and of course around the
hairline then to contour I'm going to
use a bobby brown eyeshadow this is
weeks and this is a newfound love
actually this is great so with my zoeva
luxe highlight brush I'm just carving up
my cheeks for blush and we use Malladi
Luminoso and for this I'm using a is the
wave of luxe
cheek finish brush now you want to go
all out with the highlighting we're
going to go cry cry so the highlighter
I'll be using today is mary lou because
this you can see this in space it's that
chinese so we need that so with my
morphe and 501 brush my new favorite
highlighting brush i am gonna go and
highlight my cheekbones first now with
demi you could clearly see that when she
smiled it was also on the apple of her
cheek so give yourself a little smile
and ding-ding-ding-ding
just a tiny bit we're also going to
highlight the brow bone with this above
the arch of your brow then also of
course your Cupid's bow and then also
those two lines going up to your nose
don't forget about those then i'm going
to do some directly underneath my lip
and of course the tip of the nose and
then to really get that glow going on
going in with my fixed plus by Mac and
dousing my skin with this for lips I'm
first aligning my lips using my NYX
natural lip pencil just to give me some
depth then going over top with Anasazi
Beverly Hills liquid lipstick in
milkshake
you
and following through with oyster girl
live class by Mack and that guy's
concludes this Demi lavato cool for the
summer black smokey eyes inspired makeup
