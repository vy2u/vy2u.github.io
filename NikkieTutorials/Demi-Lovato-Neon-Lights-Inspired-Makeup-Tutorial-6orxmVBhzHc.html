tutorial on this look right here and
this is completely inspired / recreated
by Demi Lovato's music video neon lights
I kind of did an interpretation on a mix
of where she's in the like full-on
backlight and also some shots where
she's like half in the backlight half a
normal light half and I don't know what
kind of light of course you have to know
that once a backlight goes on to this
the eyes light up and you will see that
under a blacklight so yeah lots and lots
of you wanted to see a tutorial on this
look and Here I am finally doing it for
you so if you want to know how to get
this damn you Lovato neon lights
inspired look then please keep on
watching so I already applied my base to
prevent my eye shadow from creasing and
for that I use my Mac soft ochre Paint
Pot to give my crease just a little bit
of definition I'm going to take heroine
eyeshadow by Illamasqua and with this
lightly bring in some definition in the
crease nothing harsh nothing drastic
just a little bit of definition to make
the eye sink in a little bit more and
then with an even bigger brush to start
diffusing that for the blue eyeliner
I'll be using my Creole on uvd glow aqua
color in UV blue and I just want to
activate that with some water and the
first thing you want to do is make that
line for how big you want the eyeliner
to become as you can see this is quite
drastic and this is quite big so I'm
going to make that blue line really long
and high up
now from there bring it to the lid and
make it a really sick cat eyeliner with
this go all the way to the inner corner
and just make it a sick cat liner for
the yellow and the green I'll be taking
this q LAN UV Daigle aqua color in UV
yellow and when you mix this with the
blue it turns out in the UV green so
that is perfect and for this is why you
want to activate it with some water and
what you want to do is start placing a
line of the UV yellow above the blue so
you will end up having a blue line with
a yellow line on top and then later on
you're gonna blend to two together and
if they mix that's perfectly fine
because you want the green to be your
transition color so when they mix it's
not a bad thing it's a good thing okay
and basically what you want to do now is
go back and forth with the blue and the
yellow to kind of give it a nice
gradient and to give it a nice mixture
from blue to green to yellow so right
now what I'm doing is I'm going back
with my blue and I'm going back in and
sort of diffusing it into the green
giving it a nice gradient effect now I'm
taking my yellow again and I'm going on
top and making the green a little bit
brighter and adding more of the yellow I
get for the bottom I'm gonna take the UV
blue again and for this you first want
to make a line that goes away from the
inner corner of your eye so instead of
connecting it to the inner corner sort
of drag it down a little bit more from
there follow it along your lower lash
line and don't be afraid to make it a
little bit thicker and give it some
depth and now you want to connect the
bottom to the top
and then quickly before it dries take a
brush and sort of diffuse the edges of
their blue to blend it in and give it a
more eyeshadow effect now take some of
your favorite concealer this is my Estee
Lauder Double Wear maximum cover and
with that we're going to clean up the
edges a bit with the concealer we're
gonna give the eyeliner a perfect sort
of sharp edge and I think this will help
you guys a lot because I know a lot of
you were thinking like oh god how do I
even get it that sharp concealer does
the trick and if you feel like you need
to blend a bit more just take that brush
again and blend the edges I will now be
taking my sleek asset palette and from
that it will be using the green and the
yellow so with the yellow I'm gonna
brighten up the top line a bit and right
now you're really scared because it
looks like crap but trust me we'll be
fine and then simply what you want to do
is with a clean brush kind of wipe it
away and then you're left with a
brighter yellow and now with some of the
green I'm gonna make the green pop a
little bit more and give it a nicer
gradient into the blue for that gap of
the inner corner I'll be filling it up
with Illamasqua eyeshadow in Anya so
just fill up that gap right here that we
left bare to add some shimmer to the
look I'll be taking the bum over shadow
sexpot pigment in no money no honey and
you just want that on this inner corner
right here and then blend it up and I
love how that adds some glamour to the
look for my waterline I'll be using my
Urban Decay 24/7 eyeliner in clash and
now all you want to do is apply some
mascara and lashes and the mascara we'll
be using is my makeup studio waterproof
a DX or black and for my lashes so we'll
be using these by Mac and these are the
number 36 okay so for cheeks what you
want to do is first contour the crap out
of your face because when Demi was doing
some
side shots you could really see that her
makeup artist contoured a lot so further
to be taking my illamasqua eyeshadow in
heroine and thumbs up for me actually
showing you how i contour today normally
i skipped the step today i'm showing you
like not in full detail but i'm showing
you that's something then to both this
out in Epsom north to my face i'm going
to take my Illamasqua blush in disobey
for my blush I'll be taking this Tarte
Amazonian clay 12-hour blush in exposed
and that just adds the tiniest bit of
color but still adds color you know so
it's not like you're brushing on nothing
you can actually see that it brightens
up the skin and it gives you a little
bit of color but nothing too drastic
whereas you have like eyes and blush and
lips and it's just really nicely
balanced there for my highlight I will
be taking my the balm overshadow sexpot
in no money no honey again and you
definitely want to go for a strong glow
on the face because that is what demi
was rocking as well so I'm get your like
high shine product and just make
yourself a glowy demi lovato okay so for
lips it's kind of your own preference
what you want to do with them if you
wanted to keep all the attention to the
eyes I would highly suggest applying a
nude lipstick and if you're actually
going to a blacklight party where you
really want your lips to pop just like
Debbie's lips did um what I suggest is
painting your lips with another Creole
on a UV glow aqua color and this is the
one in UV pink but because that is going
to show up like crazy on the lips and
that is going to be like super intense
bright a normal light I think that is a
little bit too much so what I'm going to
do is line my lips with my bubbly Brown
pale pink lip liner first and then on
top apply a soft baby pink color and
this is by wet and wild
and this is 901b think pink lipstick and
I think that's the perfect soft pinky
color that demi was wearing in the
scenes without the backlight
and that guy's completes this
long-awaited demi lovato neon lights
