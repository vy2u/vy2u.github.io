another view Tober video today on the
menu is demi lovato
i'm gonna do her first episode expect
her look from the X vector it's a really
nice warm smoky eye with this extreme
eyeliner I've been loving her in general
but since she's on The X Factor I've
been loving her even more I mean she
looks gorgeous beautiful clothes
beautiful hair beautiful makeup love
Demi so today I'm gonna do this look
that she was wearing on the X vector and
if you want to know how to get this then
please keep on watching so the first
thing you want to do it's a pipe a steer
I'll is to prevent the eyeshadow from
creasing and then one I'm using is my
Mac soft ochre Paint Pot now I'm going
to take my feet hard
I shall pellet in number 1 and I'm gonna
start defining my crease with this color
right here a little bit of that one and
a little bit of that one just really
nicely start defining your crease and
what I love is that they went all the
way in with the crease as well you don't
see that a lot with celebrities they
mostly stay right here and I loved Emmys
makeup artist for going all the way in
then with the darkest color I showed you
I'm going to darken that outer part a
little bit more than the inner part now
I'm going to blend the crease out using
these two colors right here and just
start blending that really nicely
for my eyelid I will be using a blush by
NARS called
luster and just putting that all over my
lid for my lower lip I'm gonna use these
two colors again and darken it up a
little teeny bit with this dark brown
color right here just start brushing
some of that shadow right here mainly on
that outer third and then kind of wing
it straight out then from that straight
line out go into your crease and kind of
connect it from that point also go onto
your top lash line sort of as an outer
corner liner for the rest of my bottom
lid I'm going to use these two colors
again and for my inner corner I will be
using this white cream color right here
okay so now it's time for the eyeliner
and this is gonna be a tough one so go
ahead and sit down and just kind of
really take your time for this one for
my eyeliner I will be using my black
track fluid line by Mac and the brushes
that we'll be using our nail art brush
that I got for like 2 euros and this is
by design Pro and this is number 15
we're gonna make a eyeliner sort of
straight out of the eye following this
direction right here so I'm sort of
pulling that out then just go ahead and
go back to your eyelid in your inner
corner and just make a straight line and
then on this inner corner right here I
made it a bit thicker to make it more
straight and then basically you want to
connect it to the bottom lid so it's
sort of like bottom lid going straight
out back into your eyelid and then your
inner corners I just follow along as I
do it
okay so this is the basic line I'm just
gonna perfect it a bit now okay now with
my NYX jet black slide on glide on stay
on and definitely a turn on what a proof
extreme shine eyeliner I'm gonna make my
waterline black and then it's time for
mascara and the mascara that we'll be
using are the makeup studio waterproof
3d extra black and the ultimate curl and
then of course lashes because Demi is a
huge fan of lashes and what I'm going to
use are by Miss adoro and these are
number 42 so I'm going to do all of that
right now
and then I will be back okay so
firlock's I'm just gonna use a really
nice mute lipstick because um her eyes
were banging and her lips were knitting
I mean listen gonna put a little bit of
Mac's hue lipstick one thing I was
loving about damn you were her cheeks
they were so glowy and warm and just
perfect so I first started contouring
with my NYX blush in taupe that's warm
of my face I used long combs star
bronzer in number I believe this is
number two or three and then also a
little bit of illamasqua blush in
disobey just to warm up my face a little
bit more for blush I use Magners Jeana I
think this is the color that they used
on Demi
it's like insanely close to what she was
wearing so I hope I'm right and then she
was definitely wearing highlighters and
I love that the ones I used were the
extra dimension skin finished by Mac
called a whisper of guilt and then on
top a little bit of mineralized
skinfinish in soft and gentle and that
guys completes my Demi Lovato x-factor
inspired look the one with the smoky
eyes and a really extreme eyeliner if
you couldn't tell I think this is my
third Demi video now I absolutely love
her and since she's on the expert I've
been loving her even more she's just
just perfection I love her like
