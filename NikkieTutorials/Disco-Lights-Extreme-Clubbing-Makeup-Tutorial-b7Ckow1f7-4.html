Birds ever look and they poop Tom's
mom hi my name is Nikki and I am a Angry
Birds addict hello Nikki welcome to the
group I know why / it is so cute and it
poops bombs so today I'm gonna do a look
on another addiction that I have and
that is smokey eyes and I'm addicted to
smokey eyes but today I wanted to change
it up a little bit so I added some
glitter and some color and some glitter
and did I say color already so if you
want to know how I did this look then
please keep on watching the first thing
you want to do is apply moisture eyelets
to prepend everything you put on from
creasing and I'm using my next Paoli
pink pop now let me take my Mac pencil
eyeliner impression which is the dark
blue and what I'm going to do is and I
learned this technique at the academy
from post cultists or my teacher so what
I'm gonna do first is make a basic
eyeliner
and from that Auto point out that I liar
I'm going to draw a line all the way
into my crease now little discs like for
all the people that hate my trick where
I go far into the nose line
I suggest don't follow this trick just
keep the purple outwards and don't put
it in words so for me I'm gonna go all
the way in right now as you could see on
the other eye but if you don't like that
just keep it on the outer side and I'm
just gonna take a brush like that and
I'm just gonna blend it all out
first I'm going to make that eyeliner a
dark purple with this sign sealed eyes
shadow from mech for the purple I'm
going to use the Mac pigment and push
the edge so first just make it purple
I'm going to blend it a little bit
higher up now I'm going to take next
beautiful iris and blend that above it
now I'm going to mix fiber and grape and
file a trends together from Mac and I'm
going to put that between the purple and
the beautiful iris hey that's an eyebrow
bone highlight I'm gonna take pink opal
pigment from Mac and put this on the
highest point of her arch then blend it
a bit out and clean your brush and blend
it out on the entire highlighting part
I'm gonna go back with science shield
and I'm gonna deepen up the crease a
little teeny bit and you want to blend
it on the lid so the lip becomes a
little bit darker don't make it exactly
the same seal color just darken and
blend it out of it then I'm gonna go
back with my pink opal and put that on
the remaining part of the lid dress
right there for the bottom just take a
vibrant blue electric blue eye shadow -
electric eel fro Mac and just start
blending that on the lower lash line and
blend it all the way into the inner
corners and meet it up with that upper
part like that because I feel like this
looks a little bit undone I'm gonna make
the outer corners dark just like that
side and just connect it okay the first
fun part we're going to apply some
glitter on inner corners of where you
have the pink opal on the lid I'm gonna
apply crystallized yellow glitter from
Mac and I want to use like a base for a
Mac to apply glitter with but I don't
have it so I'm going to use my la splash
eyeliner glitter base so just put some
on where you want the glitter to be and
then just apply the glitter just dab it
on
and then for the bottom I'm just going
to do exactly the same with the LH
splash one and then apply 3d silver
glitter from Mac as I'm just gonna apply
some black hole to the waterline and
some mascara and I'm going to clean up
my face because I'm like completely
covered with the glitter it's like Kesha
barf told me a player foundation after
the eyes I feel my daily face routine
before this so I already had it on but
it really looks like Kesha barf dummy
then I'm gonna take max Viva Glam Gaga
and then on top I'm just gonna use my
Wonder Woman gloss in what was it
emancipation so that completes this up
I'm addicted to smokey eyes and I want
to use glittering colors with it look I
don't really have a name for it um so
yeah thank you guys so much for watching
if you want to fool this on every
product used in this look it's on my
website make tutorials calm I love you
thank you for watching and hopefully I
will see you guys next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
