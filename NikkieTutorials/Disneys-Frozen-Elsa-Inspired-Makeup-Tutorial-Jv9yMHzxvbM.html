tutorial on Elsa from Disney's frozen
it's currently one of my favorite movies
because Olaf Olaf Olaf the star of the
movie is Olaf anyways today we're gonna
focus on Elsa Elsa is the ice queen of
the movie and she's so drop-dead
gorgeous and after getting quite some
requests for a Elsa makeup tutorial hair
and today doing it for you I love this
look it's so playful and girly and if
you play up the lips you have a really
super fun sort of clubbing I never knew
that Disney characters could have such
fun makeup so yeah if you want to know
how to get this Elsa inspired makeup
look from Disney's frozen then please
keep on watching so the first thing you
want to do is apply an eyeshadow base to
prevent the eyeshadow from creasing and
what I'm using is my Mac soft ochre
Paint Pot okay so now we'll be taking a
little bit of Nyx's milk jumbo pencil I
haven't used this product in forever and
all you want to do is apply some to the
eyelids and then with your ring finger a
bowl and that in now be applying some
sugarpill eyes shadow in poison plum and
start applying this to the inner third
of the lid so you have 1/3 a second
third and three of the third I keep
messing that up so just on that inner
third Pat that on and go up until the
crease and I'll also apply some to the
outer third now be taking this sugarpill
pigment called paper doll and apply back
to the remaining part that still hasn't
got any eyeshadow on it so the middle
and meet it up till the crease and while
you're at it sort of blend the edges of
the poison plum so you get a nice
gradient effect now to give that a
little bit more warmth are going to take
another penguin by sugarpill and this is
called birthday girl and simply lightly
dust that over the other pigment we just
applied and that will give it a really
nice pinky touch for my crease I'll be
applying some Illamasqua forgiveness ice
shadow and mix that with poison plum by
sugarpill so nothing harsh
just apply the shadow to the crease and
bring in some depth okay now I'm going
to take just a little bit of cranberry
eyeshadow by Mac and just really lightly
apply that to the line in between your
sort of untouched skin and the purple we
just apply to the crease and this will
bring in some warmth and a little bit of
shine to give them a soft hazy effect
and to blend it out I'm going to take
feather pink eye shadow by Mac and
basically what you want to do is give
that cranberry eye shadow we applied a
soft pinky haze so really softly with a
bigger blending brush start blending
that out okay so once you've done that
I'm gonna go back and forgiveness and
poison plum and bring back a little bit
more definition in the crease because
right now it's all sort of a blended
mess and you still want that definition
I'm not gonna take the slightest bit of
sugar pale Dobby pop eyeshadow to bring
in some pink lend that in here at the
outer part of the crease and sort of
bring in that touch of color I'm barely
touching my skin because the shadow is
super pigmented so just brush some in
there okay - now sort of tied a look
together because right now it looks kind
of like a mess you're going to take
forgiveness I show by Illamasqua and a
poison plum by sugarpill again and apply
that to the very outer part of your
lower lash line and then connect it to
the top so really closely to the lash
line place that combination and then
connect it to the crease part
and to blend that in seamlessly just
take a little bit of that dolly pop
again and sort of connect it to the rest
of the crease now I'm just going to go
ahead and reapply the colors to my
eyelids because of all the blending the
color sort of faded away and I really
want that vibrancy and radiant touch so
just go ahead and reapply the colors on
the lid so reapplying poison plum and
reapplying the pigments for my inner
corner highlight it will be taking Mac's
extra dimension I shadow in a natural
flirt and I'm actually just going to
apply that with my pinky finger and then
with a really small brush blend that out
of it to make the look a little bit more
Pinker than a take sugar pills pigment
in birthday girl again and apply that to
the remaining part of my lower lash line
okay so to make my eyelashes look a
little bit fuller and longer and more
sort of animated like I'm going to apply
a black eyeliner this is by Bourjois and
this is the record liner waterproof in
black and it's nothing harsh you guys
all you want to do is just make a really
simple black line to sort of ground the
look a little bit more and make your
lashes look thick and luscious
and to finish up the look I'm doing is
applying mascara to my top and bottom
lashes this is makeup Cydia waterproof
3d extra black and then on the very
outer part of my lashes I cut some 35
lashes by Mac in half so I'm just going
to take the outer third bit and then
apply that to the outer third of my eyes
as well and then you sort of get this
flirty playful eyelash look so that is
what I'm going to do now and yeah but I
already did some contouring and for that
I use my Illamasqua eyeshadow in heroine
then to buff that contour out I took
some illamasqua blush in disobey for my
blusher I will use this Mac Azalea
blossom ombre blush so it has a really
wait my camera's not picking that up so
great so you have a really nice purpley
sort of lilac purple shade and it really
peachy warm pink color it's totally not
picking off on camera but from that
ombre blush I'm going to take the pinky
side right there and then just smile put
it on them apples
and because Elsa was the ice queen you
definitely want sort of that glowy sort
of radiant Ness that word what I'm going
to take for that is my Mac extra
dimension eyeshadow in a natural flirt
and just add some glow to your face okay
so for lips Elsa was wearing it really
sort of wearable on the bright side of
pink pink when I'm gonna take is some
lip pencil to make my lips look a little
bit fuller for that of course my Bobbi
Brown pale pink lip pencil I'm gonna
take the girl and a bubble blush in
number one pink is a really soft pinky
color
