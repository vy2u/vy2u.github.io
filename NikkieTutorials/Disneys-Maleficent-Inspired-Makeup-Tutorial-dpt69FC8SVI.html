tutorial inspired by Angelina Jolie's
Maleficent ever since I heard that
Angelina was doing this movie and ever
since I saw the first trailer I was in
love the makeup the visuals just to
everything the music Lana Del Rey just
everything in a nutshell just thumbs up
for perfection so today I thought it was
fun to do a tutorial inspired by
Angelina's look throughout the movie
this is the first time I'm actually
trying this special effects contouring
magic here of course Angelina wore
prosthetics in the movie and I don't
know a thing about prosthetic snore do I
own a prosthetic so this look is totally
wearable if you just leave the cheeks
and the yellow dot in the crease out and
then of course while you drama lovers or
for Halloween for like a Disney villain
party this whole thing is perfect so
yeah without any further ado if you want
to know how to get this Maleficent
inspired makeup look then please keep on
watching the first thing we're going to
do for Maleficent skin is priming
because you want your skin to be
flawless you wanted to be pointy flaws
and just flawless so to do that I'm
going to prime using my Mac prep and
prime natural radiance in radiant yellow
and I'm also going to mix in a little
bit of illamasqua hydra veil feel that i
don't know and then just make your skin
feel amazing okay so once that is done
i'm gonna do my foundation i'm going to
use my True Match by L'Oreal and this is
n1 and what I recommend is using your
normal foundation shade and then really
highlight and bring out features with a
really light concealer it kind of feels
better and then with my Mac 159 I'm just
gonna buff all that in
so I want to do most of the contouring
with powder products but I am going to
give it a little base to work with so
I'm going to take the lightest concealer
that I have and kind of map out where I
want things to use sort of you know
highlight and bring four I'm going to
take my Mac Pro Longwear and I'm going
to use that under my eyes
and then really get that triangle going
on
and I'm just gonna buff this mess in
using my Real Techniques sponge so I
went ahead and filled in my brows
already because if I would have to
include brows in this tutorial we would
be here till tonight and if you're
watching this at night you will be here
too
tomorrow morning and as you can tell I
also already did one eye this is where
we're going for today so the first thing
in order to get that is to prime your
eyes and I'm using my Mac soft ochre
Paint Pot for that ok then I'm going to
take a really light almost white looking
matte eyeshadow and what I'm going to do
with this is pop that onto my lids to
really brighten that part up and
definitely want to pack that color on
because later on it will really open up
the eyes
a whole big lot so don't skip this step
people now I'm going to take a color by
Mac and this is called concrete and I'm
actually taking this from that
Maleficent collection so this is the Mac
Maleficent quad and I'm going to take
this color right here and really lightly
I'm going to start dusting that in the
nooks and crannies of Mac crease and you
really want to build definition and
depth in there so go ahead and dust that
in then I'm going to wipe that brush off
and I'm going to go all the way to the
inner part here because Angelina has
beautifully deep set eyes and I don't
now with a more concentrated brush I'm
going to take that color again and also
take the brown and the brown is called
ground brown what I'm going to do is
going to connect it to the bottom by
making a c-shape C then I'm also putting
those two shades on my lower lash line
and then with an angled brush I'm taking
those two shades again and I'm going
further towards my inner corner from my
Bobbi Brown rich chocolate palette I'm
going to take this color and blend my
crease out a little just go ahead and
diffuse
that crease business out I'm going to
take those two colors again on a really
fluffy brush and then what I'm gonna do
is place it on my outer corner and
wiggle it onto my lid and then I'm
taking their really light lid color
again and re intensifying that I'm going
to take butter cupcake by a sugar pill
and what they did is they place a dot of
yellow right in the middle above her
crease and this is optional but to give
it a little bit more shimmer I'm going
to take that gold color from that
Maleficent quad this is called gold mine
and then with those two I'm going to
look straight into a mirror and place it
in the middle above my crease and blend
this out softly if you want this look to
be a little bit more wearable skip this
step for the inner corner I'm going to
pop a little bit of what's up by
benefits and on top a little bit of the
bombs mary loumanizer go first a little
bit of what's up and then going over
that with mary loumanizer
now this is a little glamorous touch
that I'm adding in this is not what
Angelina was wearing um but this is sort
of my trick to make my eyes look a
little bit bigger if you want to now
going to do is apply some liquid liner
to really grab the look and give it that
sort of evil look this is my coutries
liquid liner this is the matte one and
this is called a dating Joe black and to
give it that evil look I'm just gonna
line my eyes and don't add a wing
because I really like this what's going
on here but I am gonna add this sort of
triangle pointy thing on the inner
corners and that's what you see a lot
with like evil characters that they have
that pointy in a corner so I'm just
gonna do that I'm just gonna do that
oh my god not to really finish off the
look I'm gonna add a little bit of black
coal to my waterline this is the
Smashbox always sharp waterproof co
liner in Raven and this is my favorite
waterline black notes oh goodness I love
it
and then for mascara I'm gonna use a
little bit of my waterproof Duty extra
black mascara by makeup studio f4 lash
isn't going to take the Miss adoro
number forty twos and I cut them in half
as I always do with my lashes and I'm
only taking the outer part of the lash
and just sticking that to the outer part
of my eyes it's like so not rocket
science it's so not like evil magic okay
so once we've got all that it's time for
the cheeks I'm gonna start my contouring
off using my Illamasqua eyeshadow in
heroine and firstly I'm going to
determine my shape so what you want to
do is make a slight curve here at your
temples to really sort of get that point
there and then from there follow your
natural sort of hollow part and then
your curve it in again and then I'm
lightly going to buff this out down
don't go up because that's the part that
you want to highlight and then just with
deeper colors I'm going to deepen that
up a bit and give it more detail and
then I was an almost white concealer I'm
starting to highlight and you really
want to get that sort of sharp cheekbone
here so by contrasting that dark color
with the light color you're really
bringing it forward and you really make
it look as if you have that sort of
prosthetic on your face and of course
you want to start blending that
highlight out and what you want to keep
in mind is that once you've blended it
out it's less white so you want to go
over it again to really give it that
impact again so as I said going back
with that light concealer and just at
the edge
you want to give it some more and then
I'm also with that darker color again
following the edges to really sink in
everything in I'm sorry if I'm not as
informative as I usually am but you must
know that this is the first time that
I'm actually doing sort of this drastic
of a contour to myself so it's kind of
nerve-wracking for me too okay so I've
been working on those cheats for quite a
long time now so I'm gonna let that rest
for a bit and go over to lips and then
with lips on it can kind of see if it
all ties in with each other and what
needs more and what needs less so for
lips gonna go with my Ruby will lipstick
by Mac this is Ruby whoo and then for a
gloss I'm going to take the Mac
Maleficent collection lip gloss in and
thorium I believe that's what's called
and I'm just going to pop that on to my
lips
I have no idea why I went for rooby-roo
since I absolutely hate its texture and
the way it applies already look claws
and that guy's concludes my Maleficent
Angelina Jolie inspired makeup tutorial
