Joyce is creating my last Halloween
tutorial on me and for this look we
decided to do this insane woman diva
this was once a very very wealthy woman
and she was rich and she had everything
a heart wished for and then economics
hit her in the face and she got broke
and then she got crazy so Joyce already
started working on my base and for this
she's mixing the Kryolan cream color
circle in black eye with one of the
lightest Kryolan derma colors and she's
blending the two to come up with the
super nice gory yellowy greenish skin
tone
using max sculpting powder in taupe
joyce is carving up my cheeks and my
temple area and this will give my face a
really nice sunken in feel for the lower
lash line joyce is taking the Kryolan
variety eyeshadow palette and smoking a
brown shade on my lower lash line and
now she's going in with another Kryolan
palette and taking a creamy purpley
color and applying this straight to the
lid now going back into the variety
palette she's taking a darker brown and
going into my crease and defining it and
notice how she goes all the way to the
inner corner to give that really nice
sunken in and crazy feel after that
she's going in with a little bit of
black to define the outer and inner
corners
Joyce is highlighting my inner corners
using a nice sparkly shade and now she
is buffing out the contour on my
cheekbones and temples with a bigger
brush and that same taupe color
now she's blanking out my lips to get
that really nice sik fuel and after that
she goes back into that cream circle
palette by Kryolan and making my skin
appear more greenish and sick
Joyce makes us very shades from the
variety palette by Kryolan to come up
with the perfect under-eye Circle color
now with a black shadow Joyce is
deepening the inner corners of my eyes
to give it that more sunken in feel and
to make it more creepy and then also
with that black she's going to define
the sculpting on my face more some Brown
shadows were applied to these sides of
my mouth to give it that nice dirty feel
and we were watching the new Texas
Chainsaw Massacre while filming this and
something gruesome happened time for
some nice a winged eyeliner to give that
nice that diva feel and Joyce went sassy
and high now with an intense shimmery
white pigment Joyce is highlighting my
brow bones and I quickly ran Mac's a lip
pencil in red along my water lines now
Joyce is going in with a stippling
sponge and applying red and soreness to
my nose and the corners of my mouth and
also underneath my eyes to give that
really sore and sick and irritated look
some mascara and that same white pigment
on the center of my lids
that same highlighter also goes on my
nose
and now the lips are coated with a neon
pink lipstick
with a brush Joyce is slightly dragging
let lipstick out to the corners and up
and down to give that really nice
distressed feel as if I rubbed my
fingers on it because I was getting in
soon with that same stippling sponge
she's going back in with some red and
the pink and distressing that mouth up
even more now for my favorite part of
this entire look the glitter tears
we of course figured that she was going
to cry glitter because what diva doesn't
cry glitter and for this Joyce used a
lilac 3d glitter by Claire's and holy
 cows I love it not just popping in
my black contacts and messing up my hair
and putting on my costume and we're done
