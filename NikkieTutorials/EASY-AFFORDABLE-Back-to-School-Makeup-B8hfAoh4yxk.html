on this wearable back to school makeup
look right here I've been getting a lot
of questions and requests to do a back
to school makeup look and I've done a
couple in the past but I wanted to do
something a little bit more natural and
easy to do and also I tried using as
many affordable products as I could
throughout this entire video so not only
is this easy to do it looks good but
it's affordable and it's it's wearable
but before I go over to the tutorial I
quickly wanted to mention a game you
might like as a teenager in high school
or when you're older and you have
nothing to do with your life I recently
got introduced to the high school story
game app this game is all about creating
the school of your dreams so if you're
stuck at school you feel like all the
people there suck you can at least make
your own school online and make it to
school of your dreams in the game you
can throw parties day jock date nerds
dead cheerleaders you can date girls
boys everything that's in between you
can plan a birthday party go on a beach
trip or even host your own fashion show
you know I did that in the game there's
just lots of adventure so you can do in
the game you sort of build your own
campus and you have all these people who
have their own stories and it's your
task to build the school and to unlock
everyone's story of course as you know
on YouTube there are a lot of gamers and
there's one gamer in particular which is
Toby games and he did a gameplay on high
school story and just watch that video I
will link it down below you will laugh
your ass off but if you want to know
more about this game please check out
that video and he's just he nails it see
a high school story is totally free to
download and play on your phone and I
have a special link in the bottom bar
below to download it so if you want to
play the game check out the link down
below and you can download it onto your
phone so without any further ado if you
would like to know how to get this back
to school makeup look right here then
keep on watching the first thing I wish
I knew about in high school was primer I
was the type of girl to wake up really
early in the morning to get my face done
to make my hair look good and then mess
it all up on my bike on the way to
school
they take 45 minutes just to do my
makeup in the morning and I loved every
moment of it because every day I got to
play with new makeup and experience
colors and just have fun with it
I was always known for being the girl
who did her makeup way early in the
morning and my school was seven
kilometers away from home so I had to go
on a bike ride and because of going to
school by bike I definitely needed a
primer because on that bike ride my just
my entire foundation but it would just
drip off I would look like a greasy mess
so if anyone could have told me about
primers I would have been so thankful so
I'm telling you right now you need a
primer for wearing makeup to school now
the one i really suggest and is
affordable is by Nivea men this is the
aftershave balm this contains glycerin
and glycerin makes products stick to it
if you put this on your face the makeup
will really stick onto that glycerin now
I've gotten a lot of questions if this
actually smells like a man like a boy
and it does once you first apply it but
when you start working it in and it sets
that smell it's completely gone for
foundation you want to go for something
lightweight but it's still going to make
you look flawless and it's gonna stay on
all day now there's one foundation
I truly believe in for that and that is
the Mac face and body foundation this is
waterproof it will stay on like a dream
it's super natural and flawless and
lightweight but it's expensive if you do
not have the budget to get this please
skip it just get whatever foundation you
like and you think looks best on you but
for me today I'm going to play with face
and body and I like a playing face and
body with a sponge
now as you can see that just leaves you
with a very luminous natural looking
base but still perfected and dewy for
concealer I'll be using the NYX HD
concealer and also blending that in with
a sponge I quickly went ahead and filled
in my brows now for school I went all
out with my brows I did the entire
shebang I did filling him with powder
gel carve it out with concealer I did
everything with them but right now I
just filled them in put some brow gel in
them and that's it I did not sculpt it
out with concealer which I feel like
makes it a little bit more natural of
course I had to bake my under eye area
because I creates really quickly it
doesn't matter how little concealer I
put underneath it just creases on me so
I have to do this to prevent myself from
creasing but let's go on now it's time
to powder to make this last all day long
but keep it down with the powder you do
not want to powder too too much because
that will look fake and pancake so I'm
just taking a compact powder and a brush
and very lightly brushing the oily parts
of my face nice and flawless now for
eyes you want to approach it the same as
the face we first want to prime it to
prevent everything from creasing and
making it stay on all day for eyes today
I'm going to use this Catrice nudes
palette it's very affordable and it's
got some great neutral colors at first
picking up a little bit of this color
right here and this is going all over
the lid blending into the crease
and then I'm going to go in with that
darker chocolate brown color and smoke
it on my lash line and this just gives a
little bit more definition to the lashes
and then you also want to take that
chocolate color and blend it on the
outer sides of the lower lash line
and then to highlight I'm going to take
this essence all about nudes palette and
this is in the color to nudes and I'm
going to highlight my inner corners
using these two shades right here now to
finish the look off all you need is a
little bit of mascara but you can do
just mascara but my natural lashes suck
so in all honesty I'll be applying some
really natural falsies that mimic my
natural lashes as they should be but
they're not because my natural lashes
suck by no means am I telling you to put
false lashes on in the morning for
school no I'm just doing it because my
lashes suck you probably have amazing
lashes so just coat them with mascara
and that is it for the eyes and the for
lower lashes just a mascara where needed
for the cheeks to want to keep
everything a little bit more natural and
nice and dewy and glowy so first I'm
going to bronze up my face and shape it
a little bit using this Catrice golden
light bronzer and just softly bronzing
up my face with that and also shaping it
a tiny teeny bit for a little bit of
flashing Li is the Catrice multi matte
blush and this is in the color one love
rosy
and to highlight a little bit for a nice
dewy finish I'm again going in that
Catrice all about nudes palette and I'm
taking this shimmery highlight shade
right here
healthy and dewy for lips all you want
to do is apply a light gloss and for
this I'm using these sick matte lip
Vic's in tender just because it's really
nice and soft
and that's it that concludes this look
and that guys concludes this easy
wearable but you need to take your time
