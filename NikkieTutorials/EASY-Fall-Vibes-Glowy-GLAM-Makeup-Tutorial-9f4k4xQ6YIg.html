vibes makeup tutorial I'm doing these
very clean flirty warm toned eyes but
still very clean and easily and
simplistic to do but the pressure on
clean and simplistic cuz people have
been demanding it from me and then of
course I needed my touch of glam so I
added a bit of highlighter and glossy
bronze metallic red lips yummy I am
seriously obsessed with this look I
think it screams fall I think it is so
sexy and seductive and clean and
simplistic and easy and yet without any
further ado if you would like to know
how to get this look right here then
please keep on watching alright so the
first thing on to do for this fall vibes
makeup look is sort of prime not really
gonna apply a primer because I'm just
filming this and then I'm taking it off
and I'm going to sleep and then I'm
going to the airport and going in with
the tatcha
dewy skin mist and just gonna spray and
and soak up that moisture
I'm going to go in with the air flash
foundation by Dior and I am in the color
100 now a little side note this is the
last time I'm giving this a shot I've
tried this numerous amounts of times and
every time I tried it I absolutely hated
it so I'm giving it one more shot and if
I hate it after this it's gonna be a no
God though it's gonna be one I don't
care it's gonna be one so what I did in
the past was kind of keep it at a
distance and then spray myself and it
would end up everywhere my shirt my
hairline my nose hair brows ears teeth
everywhere so not today today I'm going
to keep it very close to my actual face
and try let me try and make this work
what the brush I'm gonna blend it in and
hope for the best
that already is one of the best tries
it's ever had on my face usually it
would just go everywhere and not cover
anything I would have to go layer upon
layer upon layer but right now it's
looking pretty damn good I mean so many
people love this foundation they're like
it's my holy grail it makes my skin the
best it has amazing coverage and every
time people would say that I'd be like
bitch we're so what a lot of my friends
do is use this as a base foundation and
then go in with a classic foundation
over top in areas that you needed so
maybe I'm gonna have to get that a shot
because so far no no god no so now I'm
going to go in with my classic
Foundation which is Too Faced Born This
Way and picking up a little bit more on
my brush and in areas where I always
prefer a little bit more coverage I'm
going to apply that right on top so it's
tough with cheekbones just a thin layer
which we all know is a lie because I
don't work in thin layers can I just say
this day is full of surprises already I
used the air flash foundation because I
always hated it and wanted to give it
one last shot same goes for this brush
this is the morphe m4 3:9 I usually
never really like it because I feel like
it leaves me streaky and patchy and
uneven but today is actually the first
day were actually like this brush for
concealer today of course heart-shaped
tape and fair it's it's it's not even a
question
and I'm buffing that in he is my morphe
beauty sponge and now I'm gonna bake the
under eye area using mine our soft
velvet loose powder in snow and setting
the rest of my face is my Georgia Armani
luminous of powder morphe and four four
four and I'm just gonna now we may keep
it simple today but we still want to
prime I'm using my soft ochre Paint Pot
by Mac
now going into the two-faced power of
makeup eyeshadow pellet and taking the
color ivy and with the shade I'm going
to set my crease to brow bone area to
help blending later on now going to go
in with painkiller the perfect soft
definition crease color and really
softly I'm going to carve my crease out
with this and nothing too harsh or
intense but I just like my eyes a whole
lot better when I have at least a little
bit of definition in that crease because
if I don't do that it's like a sack of
eye skin so I always need that tiny bit
of definition to just push that crease
in a tiny bit to make me feel good now
cleaning the lid up using some more ivy
hopping over to the morphe 9 and blush
palette and using these colors to define
my lower lash line
quickly applying the Sephora colorful
shadow and liner and matte white to my
waterline to open up a lastly blinding
my inner corners using sugar coated from
the power makeup eyeshadow palette ephra
lashes I'm going to take these beauties
by Lena lashes and they come in the
cutest packaging ever watch this is the
packaging they come in it is so cute so
cute oh I love it okay for cheeks I will
be lying if I told you I wasn't gonna
use the Kevin upon medium sculpting
powders where where's this goin I'm just
using the Kevin Kwan means going past
and I'm gonna use that Sigma brush that
I am obsessed with the fo6
and as always with my face powder Murphy
m44 for I'm going to clean up and
sharpen it just so it looks airbrush and
I'm also really quickly going to contour
my nose
for bless you're going to keep it simple
and use a mixture of the two blushes of
the power of mega palette and to give my
face a beautiful radiant glow to
counteract for having such little stuff
on my eyes I'm gonna go in with
sugar-coated yes yes and also of course
tip of my news like that now like I said
I kept the eyes a very muted or like
muted and nici terms and glowing skin
because they wanted this look to focus
on that glow and the lips so I'm going
to go in with a fun little metallic
mixture so furs are going to go in with
you a lip cream in Cabernet
and then now to amp up the fall vibes
I'm going to go in with this color pop
ultra glossy lip and this is in the
color cheat code and it's a metallic
light oh my god oh and I just finish I'm
going to lock my face into place using
chill makeup setting spray by Urban
