look right here and this is a
last-minute easy simple glam holiday
makeup tutorial perfect for Thanksgiving
or for whenever the holidays are
happening like I said in my previous
video I wanted to create something that
everyone can do it is so easy like
literally this look is easier than easy
I know I said on social media that I
wanted to keep this look very simple and
on the low but knowing me I of course
had to go in with a blinding silver on
my lids but I will assure you that this
is super easy to do anyone can do this
it is using mostly affordable products
so this is one that everyone can do I
think this is such a fun look for winter
for whenever you want to blind anyone
with your glam and yeah if you would
like to know how to get this easy glam
makeup look for the holidays then keep
on watching okay the first products I'm
gonna go in with is a primer because you
want your face to last all night long
unless you're not wearing any makeup
then skip whatever I'm saying throughout
this entire video why are you watching
this video so I'm gonna go in with this
NYX hydro touch primer and this is to
hydrate and moisturize and I have dry
skin so I need all the moisturization I
can get so I'm going to use this as a
moisturizing primer and then on my
t-zone area where I get a little bit
more oily and where my pores are more
visible we'll go in with the maybelline
baby skin instant pore eraser and the
trick with primers like this is to tap
them into the area you don't want to
necessarily wipe or massage it in
because you wanted to really fill up
that pore and erase it so I find that it
does that best when I tap in products
like that for this area now I'm going to
go in with the Milani conceal imperfect
two-in-one fundation plus concealer
which aren't lies because I never use it
for concealer I use you permission alone
and I'm in the color 0-1 creamy vanilla
and then with my beauty blender and then
the bounce set into my skin
and please use as much foundation as you
are comfortable with use as little or as
much as you like I'm known to like my
layers upon layers upon layers upon
layers but that doesn't mean you should
follow that rule exactly how I do it
please take inspiration from this video
you don't have to exactly copy every
step do whatever makes you feel
comfortable for concealer today I'm
going to go in with the maybelline
instant age rewind concealer in the
color fair and because I like a little
bit more likeness with my concealer I'm
going to go in with the pro conceal by
la girl in the color white thank you for
letting me know in my previous video
that they actually do make a white
concealer because they don't have it and
bouncing that in using my Beauty Blender
again
now I'm going to bake my under-eye area
to prevent it from creasing and to make
it look flawless all night long I'm
going to set the rest of my face using
my Maybelline a better skin superstate
powder in number ten and with my Sigma
f80 9 brush I'm going to wipe away the
baked underneath my eyes
this shouldn't come as a surprise but at
first priming my eyelids to make the
look lasts all day long using my Mac
soft ochre Paint Pot and I mean yeah you
can try a different primer I just know
that soft ochre ensures me of having my
look on all night or all day long so I
change it up for the crease and outer
corner and going in with Hooda beauty's
rose gold palette in the shade
sandalwood but please trust me when I
say you can use any medium warm Brown it
doesn't depend which brand just make
sure it's a matte warm medium brown then
I'm starting off by placing most
intensity on the outer corner here
touching the lid and the crease now
start making little circle motions to
blend it out and as you're blending work
your way up higher up into your crease
from there you can lightly swipe it into
the center of the crease and all I'm
doing is soft circle motion you know you
want to think of it as whenever you want
to blend something out you want to
create circle motions think of it as the
wheels of the blending brush go round
and round then once you have most
definition apply to the outer portion of
the eye now you can swipe whatever is
the left in that brush to work the inner
portion of the crease but do this very
softly and not too harsh now with a more
dense concentrated brush and that same
color I really build up definition on
that outer corner here we're not
focusing on the crease here just on this
outer portion super easy just focusing
on that outer portion and leaving
everything else behind now going to go
in with this color pop super shock
shadow this looks amazing and it's in
the color glitterati and you can choose
to apply this color with your fingers or
with the brush I'm gonna use both I like
using my fingers to kind of stamp the
product down onto my lid and then with
the brush I refine the shape
this may be a simple look but I still
want to catch all the attention so over
top of the colour-pop product I'm
applying this Maybelline eyeshadow in
the color New York silver and for
maximum impact of that shade you want to
tap the product onto the lid so see how
I'm not swiping the brush at all I'm
tapping it up and down this is to get
the maximum coverage of my eyeshadow as
a base on my inner corners I'll be using
this NYX
Alondra ray eye tint and going over top
using this Inglot pure pigment and
number 75 blinding so first laying down
that cream product to really make that
highlight pop and stick going over top
using the pigment now I personally
obsess over strong inner corner
highlights they just have that just made
me warm on the inside but if you feel
like that is too much simply go in with
a little q-tip kind of rub the surface
of the highlight to tone it down and it
should become a lot more soft for the
lower lash line and going back in with
that medium brown color from the crease
and applying it to the outer third of my
lower lash line only using a flat
definer brush and we use that flat
definer brush to really pack on that
color and to get it there and now we go
in with a pencil brush to blend and
smoke it out
and by keeping that definition on the
outer portion of the lower lashline only
it will open up the eyes in such a
beautiful flattering way but it won't
drag them down and make them look too
heavy a little bit of white I call on
the waterline and now all we have to do
is apply some fun flirty lashes these
are Lena lashes in the style Naomi and a
lot of people always ask me how you can
master applying false lashes and in the
screen here I will show you a video that
I created a long time ago it is not the
technique that I use today anymore but
it definitely helped me getting into a
pine false lashes a lot better so that's
a great way of starting out and in the
screen here you can click that video and
check it out all right to contract today
I'm going to go in with the makeup geek
contouring powders I'm going to go with
this shade right here this one is called
a breakup and I know these are super
super pigmented so you only need the
tiniest bit you know find the top of
that cheekbone and go right underneath
to cast a shadow and to make it look
like it's carved most people on
Thanksgiving are carving a turkey I am
carving my cheekbones oh my god you guys
are gonna love this part for blush I'm
gonna bring back an old favorite
this one is Milani Luminoso blush this
one is I think this is the greatest
blush ever created in makeup kind and it
goes perfectly with the lips I'm
applying later on and with the warmth in
the outer corners and the crease and I'm
applying this using a morphe y one this
little launch in two days on Friday hmm
nothing tops this blush and I haven't
used it in a while because just like all
other products I kind of have the
tendency to use in too many times and I
just had to let it go for a little bit
to try out new things and for you guys
to see different variations on blush
because I was always using
so and it's kind of scaring me because
now that I'm wearing it again I am
falling in love all over again I know
we're with every look for highlighter
today I'm gonna go in with the blinding
Catrice glam fusion eyeshadow in the
color Jon Snow favorite you're known F
and John sneer I suck at that cuz you
know if people are gonna come for your
makeup on Thanksgiving the least you can
do is blind them I know people were
scared that I wouldn't do a blinding
glove because I was doing a simple look
for Thanksgiving a like a last-minute
simple fun look honey I need my blinding
glow without my blinding glow I am dust
which makes me think maybe I should
sometime do you an all matte look
without a glowing like a blinding glow
it's the end of my channel as we know it
and the fur lips are gonna keep it very
very simple I know with Thanksgiving
you're gonna stuff your face so you
probably wouldn't even wear lipstick but
let's say for the photos right before
the dinner or after the dinner I love
the combination of silver and peach I
just it's so magical to me like it works
together so today I'm gonna go in with
the new Kylie lip kit color called dirty
peach I've seen this color go around
Instagram so many times and every time I
see it I'm like oh of course you could
go for gloss noting a lip stain red nude
dark do whatever you want do whatever
you feel comfortable with because I feel
like these eyes go with pretty much
every single lip color out there so
whatever you want to put on your lips
you put on your lips
and then to set this all into place
I need a spritz of setting spray I'm
going to go in with the NYX dewy finish
finish and that guys concludes this
simple last-minute holiday glam makeup
tutorial using mostly silver and peaches
I surprisingly had a lot of fun with
this look I really loved how it turned
out it is soft but with a pop of glam
with the silver on the lids and I love
the silver paired with the peach
although I'm sure a lot of people will
hate that combination but you can do
whatever you want with it for a full
