that is very near and dear to my heart
if you remember about a year ago I did
this little video called the power of
makeup and in the power of makeup I I
wanted to show people that we makeup
lovers don't wear makeup because we're
insecure or because we don't feel
confident enough about ourselves no to
us makeup lovers is something where we
can express our art where we can be
ourselves and just love the process of
just seeing yourself transform and I
feel like with that video we as a
community really made a statement saying
hey back off
we love makeup and don't makeup Seamus
and I thought makeup shaming was over
and done with but a couple of weeks ago
I noticed that makeup shaming is so
alive I was on Twitter and I saw this
tweet by a woman and she had a photo of
this beautiful gorgeous girl and she was
wearing the whole nine yards she looked
absolutely fantastic glam
she was blinding for the gods she was
beautiful and there basically was this
tweet saying oh my god this is too much
this has to stop people are taking these
Kardashian trends way too far and to me
it really hit me because makeup shaming
is real and I feel like makeup shaming
has to be put to an end what harm does
it do to you to let someone play with
makeup and feel their best self so many
people out there think oh god if she is
addicted to makeup she's insecure and
she is doing it to impress boys and that
is totally not the case when you love
makeup you love the transformative power
of it you love playing with that go
layer playing with that highlight it is
not about impressing others it's for us
today I am here to do a super super glam
rose gold eye and glam metallic rattling
to show everyone that you know what
we're gonna be ultra glam to show these
makeup haters and makeup shamers to back
off now what I'm also really really
proud of is that usually when I
a tutorial a lot of people are kind of
hesitant to try the look out because it
might be a little bit intimidating to
you maybe they'll lift colors a little
something getting used to you but I now
have such a cool cool opportunity I
powered with the makeup plus app and
this is a app where you can have filters
and you can basically beautify yourself
to perfection and this makeup look that
I'm wearing today will be available as a
filter on makeup plus so if you want to
see what this look right here this ultra
glam looks like on your face you take a
photo of you without wearing any makeup
like not a stitch of makeup you take a
photo and then you can choose the filter
of this makeup look and you can see what
it looks like on you and oh my god
technology and now here comes the most
amazing thing about it when you put this
filter on your face and you post it on
Instagram makeup plus is giving back
every time this look is shared on
Instagram with the hashtag she unites
makeup plus will donate up to a hundred
thousand dollars to a special women's
empowerment organization and to make it
a little bit easier for you I put a link
down below in my description box to
download the app alright so without any
further ado if you would like to know
how to get this ultra glam rose-gold
makeup look with a fierce wing and a
metallic red lip keep on watching baby
alright so the first thing I'm gonna go
in with is by Becca this is the first
light priming filter then one of my
problem areas is my nose my chin and
between my brows I get super oily there
throughout the day so to make sure that
this amazing a layer of pancake doesn't
go anywhere I'm gonna go in with this
also by Becca it is called the ever met
poreless priming Perfector and this has
really helps me keeping my foundation on
flawlessly so the key is to take just a
tiny bit on your fingers then rub it in
and then press onto the problem areas
and just make sure that you press
that in don't blend don't swipe doh
massage press tap tap tap one of my
favorite foundation combinations as of
lately has been the Mac Pro Longwear
nourishing waterproof foundation mixed
in with the Tarte Amazonian clay 12 our
full coverage foundation these together
make for such a long lasting flawless
pancake not SNEP for concealer I'm gonna
use this to light up my under eyes and
now you can use as much as you like to
make sure this look lasts all day long
I'm first priming my eyelids the first
color I'm gonna go in with is by the
morphe 25 of B pallid and it's this
color right here so using soft circular
motions I start applying this color to
the outer portion of my crease and
wiggle it out from there start blending
it softly towards the crease now with
this shade right here I'm gonna start
blending the edges of what we just
applied even nicer right above where we
just apply that first color
we're softly touching the skin and
blending the edges into a flawless
little haze now mixing these two
beautiful colors together and this is
going on the outer V and these two
colors will enhance the rose gold tones
beautifully wipe that brush off and
softly start blending the edge into our
previous color I find that short
circular motions were the best for this
as a beautiful rose gold base for the
lid I'm going in with this pur cosmetics
cream shadow in silk
and overtop Emma playing this starlet
powder by Makeup Forever in the color
iridescent pearl for a blinding in a
corner and going in with this Catrice
highlighting eyeshadow and turned the
highlights on and I'm applying this
using a damp brush for the outer corner
of the lower lash line and going back
into with the two darkest color from her
outer corner and continuing that using
our transition color from the crease and
finishing this look off with a wing to
cut all makeup shamers in half
to seal the deal I'll be going in with
Lily lashes mikonos lashes all right
let's cut some cheekbones I'm gonna grab
my rod I'll instaglam contour powder my
morphe big fan brush which is the m1 for
three cut to warm up my complexion of
course some bronzer Oh
for blush I've been obsessing over this
pink tea blush by Mac it looks very
natural and like it won't show up on the
skin in the pan but something happens
when you pick it up with that brush and
apply to the skin it just transforms
into this beautiful soft flush of color
now some unreal out-of-this-world glow
and for lips I'm gonna go for a color
that always inspires me I'm going to
apply a beautiful red
and giving it a cool metallic effect
using a red shining eyeshadow
and of course some setting spray and
that guys concludes this ultra ultra
glam rose gold makeup look with metallic
red lips I absolutely adored this look
it is so glam and it's just a big old
middle finger to all makeup shavers and
