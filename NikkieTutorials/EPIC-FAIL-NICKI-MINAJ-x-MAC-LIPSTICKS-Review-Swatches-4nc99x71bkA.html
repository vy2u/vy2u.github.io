back on your screen with a new review
Asajj first impression
hey guys so today is actually a really
really exciting video because it was
recently announced that Nicki Minaj and
MAC Cosmetics are teaming up again
they're damn it up again all to create
two custom-designed
new lipsticks designed by Nicki Minaj
now if you have forgotten Mack and Nicki
Minaj teamed up in the past before for a
Viva Glam but these two lipsticks have
nothing to do with Viva Glam so I'm
purchasing these two lipsticks nothing
will go to charity but without any
further ado hence why I'm not wearing
lipstick hence why I'm wearing
foundation on my lips let me just get
this out of the way people always ask me
girl why is there foundation on your
lips
always I do this because with a little
bit of foundation on your lips lipstick
is gonna pop and stay on longer so much
better like you have known if you've
never tried it in your life do it right
now apply a little bit of foundation let
it dry a plier lipstick and one you will
see it lasting longer to you will see it
looking more brighter and intense and
three it's just a better life so here
are the two MEK lipsticks that Nicki
Minaj created for Mac designed for Mac
these two lipsticks are part of a
collection but they are the only two
with this limited edition beautiful
packaging if you ask me so the paint
print which is the lightest of the two
has a soft baby pink equally peachy sort
of frost metallic packaging and when we
look at Nicki's nude the darker of the
two it comes in a beautiful soft copper
tone I love so this collection consists
of 24 new and already existing lip
classes and lipsticks but since these
were the only two designed by Nicki
Minaj herself we're gonna be focusing on
these two right here because simply they
are alright so let's get down and dirty
and let's apply these to the lips and
we're gonna be starting off with the
pink print the pink print is described
as a mid-tone creamy pink and it's
amplified Finnish when looking at Mac
finishes I feel like the amplified are
the most pigmented and most creamy and
hydrating out of all of them the mattes
also are very pigmented but they are a
little bit more drying so when you look
at the amplifi it's it's basically a lot
of color pigment a lot of hydration and
just creaminess so this by no means is
like a liquid lipstick where it stays on
all day long
this is a lipstick that you reapply
throughout the day all right I am ready
for you
so the pinkprint mid-tone creamy pink
let's go pigmentation oh my god these
apply like butter
wow that applied so softly but so
pigmented and one thing I'm noticing is
it applies so smoothly and so nicely
this is what a lipstick should apply
like you know this is what a lipstick
should do my only thing though because
the amplified are so creamy and intense
but soft when putting the lipstick onto
your lip so like pressuring the tube
onto your lips this happens can you see
how that already is pushed a certain way
plus if you look closely you see that
where I pushed it on my lips where it's
still inside of the case it makes an
indent on the actual product and
eventually over time what happens for me
is this will either break or snap or
tear apart and that's just what happens
with the amplified one sadly so honestly
the only thing you can do about this is
don't like I gotta push so honestly the
only thing you can do about this is not
like roll it up all the way it's really
important to keep it as tiny and little
as possible because if you apply it like
this it's gonna snap and break let's
continue
one go what yeah that is what the color
looks like I personally think this color
is really really pretty it is a perfect
summer like spring summer late summer
color it is pink but not too pink it has
that nice coral touch to it that makes
it a little bit more but when something
this light in tone is too pink it
quickly becomes too stark and too much
but this is a beautiful like soft
colorful everyday color I like I like
this a lot I do think it's gonna be too
light on darker skin tones though like
complete honesty okay that was the pink
print let me take it off and the truth
is say hi to my natural lip color it's
intense
next up is Nicki's nude and this is
described as a soft corley pink
I think this shade is gonna be so bomb
on darker skin tones on me it's gonna be
on me it's good it's not gonna look like
a nude on me it's probably gonna look
like a soft colored darker nude slash
red but on darker skin tones this is
gonna be I think beautiful so again
let's mm-hmm tone that down a little
before we break it we only want to
scroll up with what we necessarily need
and don't push too hard stop
oh that is a lot lighter than I expected
so here is Nikki's nude after one layer
and to be quite honest with you I don't
think it needs a second layer so we only
need one coat with Nicky's nude and it
is a lot lighter than I initially
expected but still nonetheless I think
it goes perfect with the eye look that I
trust today and again when looking at
the lipstick it made an indent where the
product is inside the case I feel like
that's what we got to live with 4
amplified I dropped it I dropped it I
dropped it why me I'm so sorry please I
don't ever want to keep a nice to see
this video ever well that's the test
drop for you they don't survive and
there you have it guys that is my first
impression slash review on the new Nicki
Minaj MAC lipsticks designed by Nicki
Minaj ok it tutorial on how to be a
total ass and destroy a lipstick in two
seconds so do I recommend these
lipsticks I absolutely do I love the
colors I love the finish
I love the pigmentation I love just how
it goes on I love the color intensity
but you got to be careful with these
because these are fragile
I think color wise consistency wise the
way they apply they are a total and
absolute go it's just personal
preference if you love the colors for
yourself if you like the the new deep
inky curly peachy vibe if you want to go
for that I say go for that they retail
for a $17.50 aynd by Nicki plus the only
two with that type of packaging now you
may be asking me girl when do these
