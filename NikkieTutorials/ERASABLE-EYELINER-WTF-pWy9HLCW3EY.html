however eyeliner dreams come true can
eyeliner no longer since our fears today
I'm gonna be diving into an eyeliner
that I recently found out about that oh
my god is it finally our time to face
the balls of AIA binder as you guys know
Islander will have us for breakfast
lunch and dinner and dessert like it
will eat us alive today we're gonna take
a closer look at the vamp stamp of ice
virtue eyeliner now if you're thinking
girl that's eyeliner
there's a lot of them on the market this
one has an eyeliner but it also has an
eraser you heard that right
so if you make a little booboo with your
liner fear no more because the vamp
stamp now has a liner corrector slash
eraser and I really want to put it to
the test because this is not the first
time this hit the market this has been
on the market for a little bit but
different brands and never have I had
enough trust in my body to actually try
it because there was like you know it's
just gonna look like a mess and today
I'm actually gonna see if it actually
does look like a mess so without any
further ado if you want to know if you
can nail the perfect cat eye without any
mistakes and if you do make a mistake
you can erase it from planet Earth
let's find out if this is any good
alright so here we have the liner plus
the eraser and I'm not wearing any
makeup because let's just look at what
the website says before I make any
judgments the Weisse virtue eyeliner and
correct your pen by the vamp stamp says
that'll make the perfect wing look even
easier the inky liner end includes a
deluxe lash serum it is a water
resistant formula the corrector side
virtue cleans up makeup mishaps and
winged whoopsies they literally said
whoopsies use the virtue to sharpen the
point on wings that went wrong both tips
can be removed and flipped over for
further use okay so you think eraser
when you would do a full face with this
and you would go in with the eraser my
only fear would be that you would erase
everything meaning foundation concealer
primer all of that and to most people
this won't be an issue my skin tone will
not end up looking like this in the
the video because I put a lot of
attention on for me when I erase a part
of my foundation you will see the
illusion being okay you will see the
line you will see that I'm catfishing
everyone 24/7 so that is my only fear so
I really want to try it on bare skin
first to see how much it actually cleans
up and then we can try it on a full face
of foundation ok vise eyeliner here we
go so I'm gonna start off by creating my
wing it's a very pigmented liner for
sure
so I'm barely touching the skin and the
eyeliner is coming straight onto my skin
don't see any bleeding going on just yet
like that's a nice little wing right
there now let's take it back onto the
lid alright so honestly so far I have
nothing to complain about the liner it
is going on very black very opaque very
easily
alright let's fill in the gaps okay so
now that the liner is starting to dry a
little bit more I find it hard to go
back in and like even things up a little
bit more because I feel like the liner
dries a little bit rough gives our one a
liner dries you can go back over top
because it dry smoothly and this I feel
like it's dragging a little bit so I'm
just giving it some time to air a little
and then try to mix it see like I want
it glide over here to even this part out
but then it kind of gets stuck to move
and also when I'm trying to reapply the
liner it's actually taking away the
liner see that I try to go over it and
it's creating a little patch a little
hole are you infused with the corrector
okay we got the wing on and things can
be a little bit more fine things can be
a little bit more
detailed and I feel like that tip can
like go we're gonna dive into the
corrector side and let me just try it on
the back of my hand that comes out clear
so I'm just gonna put the corrector side
against the eyeliner side and try to
clean things up a little bit more make
things look a little bit sharper it took
away weight but then if you take it away
it does it come on to the oh it does
pick it up a little bit see I'm gonna go
right at the point like the tip of the
liner and try to drag it out to make it
more fine
okay so it's not really dragging it out
it's actually removing the product so my
philosophy was it's probably gonna break
down the product a little bit so you can
drag it out and really move it around um
no it actually removes it I will say
this eyeliner formula is not my favorite
like the more I want to go back in to
reapply or to adjust my lines a little
bit it's like starting to brittle down
the product a little bit leaving me with
like little holes and like messiness so
that is my liner after applying with the
liner side and then correcting the edges
and I will say it's looking nice and
sharp the eraser actually does erase so
it's not breaking down the products and
trying to like reactivate it it's a
pretty damn intense corrector if you ask
me so I'm wondering if this will take
down foundation with it is like will
this take down of it's like I'm going
down and you're coming down with me so
I'm just quickly gonna do my face now
and then I'll be back to try the liner
on top of I shadow and then see if the
corrector takes a mrs. foundation over
at the left side corner
so now that I've got eyes shadow on I
want to see how the consistency and
formula of the eyeline apportion reacts
you actual shadow on the skin so let's
dig in I'm gonna start off by creating
my line just like I did on my bare skin
now let's take it back
okay so just like on the bearskin no
trouble so far the trouble comes when I
want to go back in with the liner part
and kind of go over to make it nice and
sharp so let's just complete the shape
okay fill it in so on top of shadow it
is not the blackest black liner I've
used and it's not the the most easy to
apply to like fill in because it takes a
little bit of time to like distribute
the product over the bear space I feel
like damn it this is what we're looking
at let's see if the corrector is
hardcore okay let's clean up right
underneath oh boy oh yeah that is
absolutely breaking down the foundation
see you can even see it on the tip of
the corrector as to be expected it's not
only taken down the liner it's taking
down everything with it it's like a
second line created it's like foundation
natural skin liner I would put it on the
lid but I'm really not in the mood to
remove all my shadows okay so here's the
thing correctors are fun and all but as
soon as you start correcting on top of
foundation skin you're taking down
foundation or like any base like
concealer with it - meaning you have to
go back in with the concealer to sharpen
up and clean up and make it look like
skin again meaning you can clean up your
liner with concealer anyways so you
don't even need a corrector
and boom the bottom of your wing is now
sharp precise it looks like face tune it
looks photoshopped without a corrector
that takes down everything with it I'm
gonna apply lashes to hide all my
mistakes be right back you might be
asking yourself where do we know vamp
stem from vamp stamp is known for doing
the eyeliner stamps so they have
eyeliner stamps and an eyeliner pot you
dip your eyeliner stamped into the
little pot and then directly onto your
eyes and it creates the wing for you so
I was excited for them to see what their
next step would be and the vise virtue
is their next step and it is not for me
I love a good wing that is sharp that is
neat that is in your face and that can
cut all haters in half this is nibbling
the haters it's not cutting them it's
not poking them it's it's nibbling their
toes a little bit I would have liked the
Vice portion of this so much more if it
actually would allow me to make my lines
smoother and apply more product over top
of the already existing products on my
lid the corrector I see this correct
you're working when you're doing your
eyeliner on a bare face like I showed
you in the beginning it worked fine on a
bare face I am so full coverage I am so
into my foundation that a bare face and
just eyeliner on me is not for me I feel
like the biggest makeup trend here in
Holland is eyeliner mascara and lip
gloss and I don't feel like a lot of
people focus on the skin too too much
because it might take a little bit too
much time or whatever but eyeliner is
such a necessity right here that I feel
like for the Dutch public where I am
from this could work out the people here
don't really care about the base a lot
of people do but a lot of people don't
let me feel like this if you love that
luminous glowing natural skin the
corrector is actually gonna be great for
you because it's just gonna erase your
mistakes and nobody can tell now however
if you're like me and you love your cake
face erasing the langer on top of your
base is not gonna work out as you saw
because it's just gonna bring you back
to your natural skin creating another
line you're having to go back in with
concealer and it's gonna take you so
much more work while you could have come
ended up with concealer from the
beginning so do you kind of feel where
I'm getting from I don't want to pass on
the corrector to too quickly because I
feel like there's different types of
people with different types of standards
when it comes to to makeup and like
different preferences that it's just not
working out for me but it may work out
for you
what that comes that this retails for
$23 and if you ask me a lot of people
have a concealer a lot of people have a
winged liner this is not the best liquid
liner that I've tried in my life it's
$23 of I didn't really need that now
again I do want to say that preferences
are so personal what may work out for me
perfectly maybe the worst product for
you and vice versa so please respect
each other's opinions and this is just
how it worked for me but again that's
just my opinion and if you think my
opinion sucks then keep it moving
alright so that's it guys I feel like we
still are on that quest to finding the
perfect eyeliner product and until we
find it I'll be right there with you
showing you what I think of all the new
products coming out so I want to thank
