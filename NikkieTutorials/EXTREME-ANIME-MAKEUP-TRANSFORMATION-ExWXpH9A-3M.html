today's video I wanted to try something
new today I wanted to do an extreme
anime look there's just something so
captivating and magical about the
transformation of anime makeup because
you make your eyes look so big and it's
just it's so fascinating to me I really
want to dive into that style today and
try for myself I'm also very very
honored to mention that today's video is
sponsored by the game love Niki love
Niki contacted me and they were like hey
we really want you to try our game and
if you end up liking it maybe we can do
a sponsorship and I played the game I
mean I'm already loving this game
because it's it's got my name in it and
here is the opening sue free stuff so
this is what it looks like and to start
you have to tap love Nicki is about
Nicki and Nicki embarks on a magical
journey through seven Nations so
basically what this game is about is
that you have a journey through these
seven nations and you come across all
these stylists and designers and you
have to battle them and they sell very
from casual everyday fashion to fairy
tales to sci-fi to gowns to glamour
every style is in this game my favorite
part about the game is that you can buy
new stuff you can buy new hairdos you
can buy makeup and this is what really
makes it fun for me because I love
shopping and I love dressing on my
little doll I left dressing up Nicki
myself you can also play this game with

on zero friends so please invite me to
be your friend and maybe we can play
this game together and also in the
description box is a link to a giveaway
and this giveaway will give you free
items in the games - clothing hair free
items is always a good thing in my book
I'll leave a link down below in the
description box on where you can
download this game I highly suggest you
trying it out even if it's just
downloading and seeing what it's all
about because I really think it's a lot
of fun and not just saying that because
I'm gonna pay it so without any further
ado if you would like to see me
transform into an anime character
inspired by love Nicki the game and just
anime in and of itself then please keep
on watching not gonna let you guys I'm
kind of freaking out about this tutorial
slash transformation because I
have no idea where this going I'm just
playing off some of my favorites miss
game Matt on Instagram and kimchi and
just anime in general and it's freaking
me out a little but I'm here to learn
and try and please know just who are so
the first I'm gonna do this is like skin
is gonna be the most easy step for me
because I can just do what I always do I
don't have to worry I don't have to be
scared skin is the simple step of the
day now in a lot of extreme animate
transformations I say that people block
out their brows to completely cover them
up and create a set of neo brows for
themselves I'm not gonna do that I feel
like I want all this sort of illusion to
be right here as opposed to up here time
for a nice mix of foundation
concealer time and I'm going to set it
and forget it using the fit me loose
powder by Maybelline okay so who is
ready for a crazy reveal I did some work
off-camera to gather my thoughts and
hello so this is wildly inspired by Miss
game act on Instagram he is a drag queen
that is known for this eye look he's
also the creator of the Bratz doll look
and I feel like I kind of changed and
altered it a little to make it more
anime alright some prayers to me please
because I hope this eye will look a
little bit like 10 percent the same of
this side okay where did I start the
first thing I did was primed so let me
do that
now I'm gonna go in with a brown warm
brown and kind of sketch out where I
want my new crease to go to and I'm
definitely creating a lot of space here
for a new lid I'm kind of following the
hollowness of my actual bones like where
my brow bone starts sort of in that
hollow is where I place this line and
please don't worry if you don't get this
super super neat at the first go because
we're just gonna sketch it out and blend
it out and then we're gonna carve the
lid out with concealer again to get it
nice and tight
then on a Buffum blend BB 14 brush I'm
going to buff this out using the same
color
so I'm just focusing on blending this
out and getting it nice and soft because
this is essentially going to be your new
crease picking up a lighter warmer shade
as a transition and making it even
softer and now taking a darker Brown and
really going in and intensifying that
detail all right so now that we've got
the base crease done it's now time to
clean it up and carve it out to create
our new lid
setting it with a shimmery white shadow
and all the shadows I've been using so
far our rejuve is place and I'll put
down below in the description box what
exactly I'm using guys we're doing this
one step at a time so don't feel like
you have to be rushed or whenever you're
doing this for a party or for a look
take your time it's nap time should be
black eyeliner and we're gonna cover the
entire lid as you can see and I have a
nice little trick for that to see how
far you can go so you take your liner
and you're gonna put it on the base of
your lash line okay look up that line is
going to show you how far you have to go
at least to not get any transfer so this
that line is gonna be my guide
time for our wing okay that is the
overall shape now with the same black
gel liner I'm going to fill this all in
now I'm going to set that liner with a
black shadow also by Jovi's place using
a nude eye pencil I'm going to sketch
out my brand new eye and you want to let
it start from within that new inner
corner dragging it down creating a nice
little tear duct point area and then
we'll see
I'm kind of following the natural socket
of my eye when I squint my eyeball kind
of pushes out right underneath is where
I want my new eyeball to be taking those
Browns again and acting as if I'm
applying eyeshadow to my lower lashline
although when a new lower lashline is
right there this look is gonna look like
trash until the last step so trust the
process and also don't take ugly
screenshots think you're just taking
that warm sort of orange color that I
applied as a transition shade in my new
crease and this is the color I'm using
to blend the brown outfits all right
time for the fun stuff now I'm gonna
carve out the whites of my new eyeball
this is a cry on TV paint stick in white
and I'm just gonna apply it right there
and leave a little ball pupil open
setting that with a white shadow with
the urban decay razor-sharp liner in the
color revolver I am drawing in a new
pupil and then because I naturally have
bluer eyes I'm gonna take a little bit
of this eye shadow topper and a
holographic I should have stopped her by
Barry M and this is in the color
asteroid and just dusting this in the
middle makes it so pretty and a little
bit of dark blue a liner right here
where the new eyeball is like the pupil
will hide that a gap of skin alright
time for additional shading and
highlighting this is what's really gonna
bring this eye to life so with that nude
pencil I'm just gonna carve out the
white of the eye into an actual eyeball
shape because right now it's a little
weird feeling that little bit of pink
and now it's time for the highlighting
and this is what's gonna transform this
eye so we're gonna add a nice glare of
wetness right here on the actual pupil
like I did over here it will make the
eye look more realistic on wet and just
dots of wetness like you would see in
your own eye
okay now for the fun part the lower
lashes these are elegant lashes in
freedom number two and I take a long one
on the outer corner a short one in the
center and then a long one again okay
then for the top we need some big old
drag lashes and these are also elegant
lashes these are euphoria number two you
know so funny when I close my eyes it
still looks like I have eyes no okay so
time for blush and I want to do a nice
subtle like pop of pink going from the
eye onto the cheek and also a little bit
on to my temples I'm a now contour my
nose to make it look as tiny and cute
and anime as possible
a little bit of highlight oh that's a
lot for lips I want to do a nice
gradient new lip so I'm gonna try
and then for a lipgloss I'm taking senti
Beauty all right let me put on a wig and
I'll be right back and there it is guys
