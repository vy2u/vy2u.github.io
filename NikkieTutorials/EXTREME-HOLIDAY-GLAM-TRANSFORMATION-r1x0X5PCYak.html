today I woke up and the first thing that
came to mind was oh my god I have to pee
quickly after that my thought was I am
so in the mood for a holiday makeup
tutorials were clothes that attire
snitches and I'm still talking with eyes
closed hello I just woke up and the
first thing I saw was the glitter which
is basically a normal thing for me on
day to day basis I am so in the mood to
come up with a holiday makeup look that
has a little bit of a twist so winged
liner glowy skin lashes red lips but
with a twist I don't know what that
twist is going to be a but I will I will
get there eventually hopefully so today
of is a lovely day I hope you are
joining me as we sit down to our makeup
and get glammed together so that is
exactly what we're gonna do so let's
stop talking and let's get glam baby and
I might have a fun surprise coming at
the end of this video
hahaha alright so the first thing I'm
gonna do is per rhyme this is amazing
cosmetics illuminate primer highlighter
in glow
for foundation my favorite combo at the
moment angel food fo filter foundation
right hooda beauty and beige away the
high coverage cream is that wet whoa
essential high coverage cream foundation
in the color alabaster and in a tapping
motion I apply that to my entire face
and I'm a full coverage addict and if
you're not a full coverage junkie addict
like I am fear not we can still be
friends as I look ridiculous right now I
am doing so much preparation for
something I do every year towards the
end of the year and my true followers
will know what I'm talking about it's a
special kind of a week on my channel and
in that week I will do a video that I've
been dreading for so long but I'm gonna
do it meaning yes I will finally delete
my channel during that no kidding
meaning yes I will finally do a natural
makeup challenge video during that week
so stay tuned for that all right some
concealer
and now I'm baking my undereyes using
the Maybelline fit me loose powder in Oh
5 first are going to go into this the 4
approp ignant palette in the version
cool and saying this color right here
called flecks to define the crease outer
and inner corners so picking this color
up on a 2 to 7 brush by zoeva and
packing this on onto the inner and outer
corner and then going into the crease so
then once you've got the shape you're
going back in with the brush and with
the soft circular motions you're going
to believe that harsh edge out
time to cut the center of the lid using
this Mac select cover-up concealer for a
spotlight smokey eye and then setting
that using the color powder from that
same Sephora palette you can definitely
also opt to go for a shimmery color on
the lid like this but I love having that
contrast of an all matte eye and then
the glitter liner over top as a guide
for where I want my glitter liner to go
to I'm first going to do my winged liner
using this line right here by makeup
forever this is the aqua liner in number
10 and I'm going to make my wing a
little bit more thick than I usually
would because you still obviously want
to see the glitter so go a little thick
and wing it out a little more honey now
I'm going to go in with the NYX glitter
primer as a base and I'm going to start
off from inner to outer corner so first
I'm gonna pack this on on the inner
corner and following it up with glitter
and the first glitter I will be using is
by go get glitter and this is called
gold mine a holographic gold on the
center the exact same step using amber
light by go get glitter and the final
glitter is red velvet
until you have a gradient glitter liner
like this and the fun thing is is that
you can do this with any color glitter
you want yummy I'm defining the lower
lash line using flex and hot chocolate
from the same Sephora pallets lse
blinding that inner corner I'm so sorry
alright time for falsies these are the
Tati lashes in tl6
okey-dokey so the glitter ombre liner is
on with the spotlight smoky eyes on top
smoky bottom time to focus on the cheeks
I feel so good about these eyes I've
been wanting to do this for so long I
was inspired by Louise this is another
amazing makeup artist from the UK and
she you can follow her on Instagram her
Instagram name is right here and she did
this on break litter liner and it was so
in love so I finally put my own spin on
it and did it myself so now let's focus
on the cheeks believe it or not I have
not been bronzing using hoola light can
we get her out of applause I've been
bronzing using this combination right
here these are Mac next to nothing
pressed powders in the color dark and
the color medium plus I kind of use the
two together as an overall bronze and
then using medium plus to kind of buff
out the edges because this is like a
little bit darker than my skin tone so
it kind of erases any harsh lines and
the brush I've been using with it is a
morphe r one so this is it's like a
Beauty Blender on the stick it's like an
egg can you see I'm gonna bronze my face
using this combo and Mitchell another
hint at like one of my favorite makeup
artists on this planet Earth top me too
because he introduced me to these
patterns taught me to apply these in a
pressing motion so instead of swirling
it onto the cheeks you want to stamp it
onto the cheeks up and down up down or
banana or not quickly doing some
additional contouring and I know it
looks a little crazy right now but trust
the process for blush you're gonna go in
with this one right here this is by Mac
this is an extra dimension blush in the
color fairly precious and this has a
little bit of warmth but also a really
really nice Sheen so it also highlights
the apples of your cheeks and want to go
see how it adds that shine so if you're
not a blinding highlighter type of
person you can just keep that little bit
of shine in your blush and glow that way
I'm of course gonna glow on top of this
look like a disco ball alright we're
looking a little all over the place so
let's cut underneath the cheek hi yeah
Santa but you want your beard back what
that was the worst joke I've probably
ever made on my channel I'm so sorry for
highlighter and then I go in with nylon
eyeshadow by Mac because this is also in
the inner corner so I kind of want to
tie it in with each other and make it
cohesive thank God I had no idea that
nylon was such a pretty highlighter on
the skin I always loved it for the inner
corner but I never thought to like put
it on the rest of my skin and I'm living
if you have nylon try it okay now let's
make sure we brush our bake off because
I've been getting a lot of tweets that
people have been leaving their bake on
because they totally forgot like I did a
couple of videos ago make sure it's off
because you don't want to look like
you're stealing Santa's job all right
enough for lips I want to go for a
perfect true Christmas red because the
twist of this look of course is the
glitter liner and the halo smokey eyes
so I'm gonna go in with the fenty Beauty
Stunna lip paint in the color uncensored
and I will try to make it as perfect as
Alyssa Ashley did but I feel like nobody
can look like Alyssa Ashley with this
lip on
all right and now let's finish off with
a lot of setting spirit because you want
to lock this baby into place and that
guy's concludes this holiday glam
classic holiday glam with a twist
makeup tutorial / get ready with me / I
don't know what to call this I hope you
