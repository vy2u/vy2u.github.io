here at least I think it is Siri when
does summer starts summer begins June
21st 2018 well some are almost started
that is I feel like I'm too high in
frame hold on let me just oh oh that was
way too much summer is right around the
corner and I am in the mood for a summer
transformation it is time to bust the
sweat out and look glistening on the
beach or if you're a vampire like me you
say in house and don't go to beaches
because you're to skip that your glam is
gonna melt away this one's for you today
I want to bring the heat and really
serve you some glam and it all started
because of this let me grab it it all
started because of this right here I got
the fenty beauty I'm kilowatt foil
highlighter in this duo right here this
one right here now imagine Charlize
Theron on a beach with a beautiful
sunset the Sun is glistening her face
she looks down at the sand and boom this
is on her lid this cone right here is a
do your perfume add in a shadow this is
what all the gorgeous gals wear when
they want to look sexy on the beach and
they're like oh my god me I don't wear a
stitch of makeup powder me so without
any further ado let's get this summer
transformation started if you thought
this video was all about showing you how
to wear a light coverage layer of
foundation to the summer days this is
not the video I'm so sorry my dear but
you're a navigation st. you took the
wrong address I do however have a
separate video from I believe a year ago
on where I really go in and show you how
to make a long lasting full coverage
base for summer so definitely go check
it out you can click it on the screen
right now and that is mostly the
technique that I'll be following said
day now I definitely want to prime
because we live in the Golden Age of
primers and first of all of course
always tatcha sill canvas this is now I
also have this
you see this I know you're like what but
then you're like oh my gosh this right
here is my iconic London it is coffee
water mist original and it says prep set
glow so I want to spray this on my face
as a prep and after to give me that
intense glow my glowy
nao-san for Foundation and my favorite
at the moment and especially for summer
is by Maybelline this is the 24 hour
super stay oh and if you're asking
yourself Nicki where did your nails go
it came over and made them flow away
from this planet
conceal the time
it is key to set your face with powder
I'm setting my under eyes using the fit
me loose powder by Maybelline this is
the best for the under eyes in my
opinion and the rest of my face I'm
setting with the translucent Laura
Mercier powder all right first things
first you are playing yourself if you're
not priming your lids put on all that
hard work in for nothing prime baby
going into the nudie patooty palette by
Laura Lee Los Angeles and taking the
color streaking and using a morphe M 532
brush I'm just buffing this into the
crease to create dimension there isn't
really a technique that you want to
follow just get it on there but I
definitely suggest getting it all the
way up here to give you that structure
and warmth now you know I cannot live
with um Lynette edges so I'm going in
with undressed and fading them away and
doing so on a Mac two to one brush so
the look I'm going for today is I want
it to look as if my eyelid is glossy and
wet now we all know glossy and wet
products on the eyes don't last for up
to 10 seconds the crease I want to have
the look of a glassy eye but not the you
know the non-existing longevity so now
it's time to go in with that Fenty
Beauty kilowatt foil highlighter the
brown portion is called sand castle and
this is going on to the lid blending
into the crease that's right shimmer in
the crease
Oh My heavens do I love this color it is
insane now it's starting to get that
sexy do your perfume add Sheen but we're
not quite there yet I want to take it to
the extreme so this is where this little
shadow comes in from Bobby Brown
this is called a Lux eyeshadow in the
color moonstone this applied with a damp
finger to the center of the lid going
all the way up to the brow we'll give
you that wet sheen and yes we're going
from lash line all the way to the top so
here it is and then on you know what
we're taking it even further I'm taking
one of these Stila magnificent metals in
the color diamond dust and go crazy baby
boom wetness with the longevity now I
want to highlight my inner corner using
Stark from the annuity patootie palette
and to give the lower lash and a little
bit of lovin and going back in with
streaking for lashes today I'm going in
with goddess by Lily lashes
all right so those are the eyes
completed and just let's take a second
it looks what I know I'm freaking out
about a shimmery eyeshadow like I'm a
lunatic but I'm living for this the face
is looking a little neglected so let's
give it some love
first I'm gonna be bronzing and I'm just
gonna hit the cheekbones first so the
classic bronze like you always would
along the forehead or shall I say eight
head before the haters do beat you to it
and I'm also taking my bronzer a little
bit and going over the bridge of my nose
you always see when it's summer you
spend some time with the Sun you always
have warmth around your nose and on top
of your nose so doing that today
now i'ma pick up some blush this is an
orange II toned blush this is called
modern Mandarin by Mac as this he'll be
gone for like a red-orange lip this will
tie in perfectly with it just a little
bit cuz you don't wanna you know go all
the way but still go all the way and I'm
also putting this on the nose - it's a
first here get that color oh my god
she's back oh I'm at it fake freckles it
is
oh my god I am loving a freckled fantasy
I know this is not everyone's cup of tea
and that's fine have you heard that a
lot of people are getting freckle
tattoos actual tattoos on their faces of
freckles for highlighting I want to look
like a glowy mess so first gonna
highlight the tops of my cheekbones all
the important parts and then I have a
little special trick now if you want to
intensify that all-over glisten I also
have the new hourglass veil translucent
powder this has a glow to it so if you
were looking to buy this to mattify or
set your face I wouldn't really
recommend it because it has a sheen and
it intensifies pores are like any
texture so just in the smart spots is
where you want to apply this so let's
say you want to look a little bit more
glowy on the forehead you could apply
just a tiny bit right there and it'll
add that glisten and that Sheen but
nothing to highlight II also right here
also right here so everywhere where you
want a little bit of you know doing this
going on but nothing too intense is
where you apply the hourglass filled
powder see how that makes you so
luminous I love it a lip I would suggest
what this is what will look so sexy with
this and very you know like the cool
girls tube nowadays is a darker outer
edge with a lip liner and then fill it
in with a neuter gloss but because I
want this to scream summer I'm gonna go
for a bright color today and that color
being quite the standout from Mac
I know what it is summer and I do think
of glosses when I think of summer so
it's time to add a little bit of
funkiness this is the Urban Decay hi-fi
shine lip gloss in the color gold mine
oh my god and to finish everything some
setting spray and I'm gonna go with the
iconic and that guys concludes this
summer makeup transformation I feel like
a cutesy summer goddess
