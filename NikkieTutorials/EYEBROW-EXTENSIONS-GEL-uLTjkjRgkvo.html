welcome to winter wonder week day seven
it is the final and last day of winter
one week today so for one last time it's
the most wonderful week here
so for the final episode of winter
Wonder Week this year I originally
wanted to do my 2017 best and favorite
products my favorite hits of the entire
year but then this came in this is a
Korean beauty product and I saw this
going around on Twitter and Instagram
and it blew my mind the video
demonstrated someone opening a jar full
of hair and gel basically that is what
it came to it looked like a jar full of
tiny little hairs covered in gel and
then she started to pining it to her
hand and she had a full-on Harry Brown
on her hand and my sparse brows were
like screaming screaming to my brains
Wow so I searched through every little
corner of the internet and I stumbled
upon the original product this right
here is a brand called really eyebrow
extension I do not understand that
language but it says really eyebrow
extensions it also says that it is for
sparse eyebrows thin eyebrows or unruly
eyebrows it has four shaher extract
which is moisturizing and it is
water-resistant we'll see about that but
it also says it's easy to wash off with
warm water I thought you were water
resistant anyways this right here is a
brow product that contains little fibers
and by little I mean long ass fibers
that look like hair this is the product
right here it comes with a little brush
comes with it and then in here is a jar
full of air it definitely has a look it
looks like Uncle Barry forgot to clean
the shower so this is so so interesting
and this might be a holy grill for
people with alopecia it might be a Holy
Grail for me with very sparse eyebrows
so today I want to put it to the test if
you shave your brows so today imma put
this to the test i first gonna put it on
bare skin to see what it does exactly
and then I'm gonna try and incorporate
it into my usual brow routine to see if
it does anything wild so welcome to the
final day of winter wonder week and
let's see if these
really eyebrow extensions really work
alright so originally when I saw the
video like I said it looked like someone
had a jar of hair trimmings and they put
it on their hands and it created a
complete hairy realistic looking brow
and even with the product set it looked
like the person who did it could brush
up the hairs and do stuff with the hairs
and like it was a full-on real actual
brows so right now I'm not wearing a
stitch of makeup and these are my
natural brows this is how they this is
how I live my life and first I want to
try it on my bare brow to see if it
makes a major change if it makes a vast
difference so let's start off so I'm
starting off by brushing my brow hairs
up there and I personally miss body like
right around here at the tail the front
could be a little bit more thick so far
the only color I could find online was
black so hopefully it doesn't look too
too weird on me so I'm opening up the
jar uncle berry and then right here is
the brush first of all when I smell the
product it has a very fresh flowery
scent to it so it definitely is scented
and it smells like a fresh garden right
I have no idea how to go about this but
here we go I'm gonna dip my brush in it
literally looks like hair gel with hair
stuck in it alright I got some and now
let's play it I guess um okay so first
off I'm noticing that there's little to
no precision it just kind of applies it
everywhere oh my god oh my god it's so
messy okay so it has no precision oh my
god okay so I'm just trying to get the
hairs up front where I miss hair I guess
I'm just gonna brush away what I don't
want
first away what I don't want going
through
the brow and I feel like I'd keep like
picking up some of the hairs or like the
fibers and then oh and then placing them
somewhere else and I don't mind that
because you get a little cluster of
fiber sash hair in one place so you kind
of have to like go at it and distribute
it all throughout the brow
okay picking up a little bit more oh my
god what on planet earth am i doing on
my channel right now okay one thing I am
noticing is that it is almost like
gluing down my natural brow completely
like it almost feels like I'm using a
glue stick to like glue the hairs down
to do a Drac look they are completely
flat against my skin so it feels a
little bit off and it looks a little bit
weird and I feel the product drying in
now and it feels a little bit it feels
like glue is drying on my brows as far
as difference I mean it definitely looks
hairier it definitely looks darker it
looks a little bit more well it's not
the easiest product but I feel like what
I think what I personally think this
would be amazing for is if you do your
brows and to make them look more natural
what I always do is put a darker Brown L
in the hairs that I do have up front in
the front and this will give you that
more realistic hairy type of feeling at
the front of your brow instead of like a
blocky or like a fade and I feel like if
you do this at the start of your brow
and then keep the rest very groomed very
perfected it's gonna make it look more
natural
I mean I'm just gonna say cuz we're all
thinking it it looks like we cut some
pubes and stick them to our brows I mean
I'm just addressing the elephant in the
room here I know we're all thinking it
all right so it also claims to be
water-resistant this is for all of you
who will wear this on that first date so
I have my avian spray okay well I mean
they're on if I touch them a little it
moves oh yeah you pick up a little bit
okay so you can get him wet just don't
touch them when they're wet and then
let's see if they come off easily oh
yeah oh yeah oh yeah and they're gone
okay so I'm gonna do my makeup right now
and then we'll see how it looks
incorporated into the routine all right
so here I am with foundation concealer
powder and most of the brows and what I
think and what I hope this product will
be really good for is brushing some of
the fibers onto the front of the brow to
make it look more natural so let's try
that stepping in on okay now it's
starting to work a little bit so the
technique I'm noticing that works for
this type of look is grabbing the
tiniest amount of product but I do aim
to grab the most fibers and then i
flatly stick the fibers on to the brow
so I stick them on a stick stick and
then with a little spooley you can try
and maneuver them into the right
position and then it gives you that
really nice hairy field it is a lot of
work for such a minimal effect to the
brows but it is that type of effect that
will make everything look a little bit
more believable so I know what my
opinion is on this product now and I
think I have shown what it does and what
it won't do so I'm going to finish doing
the
my makeup and then I will be right back
with my final conclusion all right so
the really eyebrow extensions what do I
think of it I think it is fun and I
think if you really use this for a
couple days straight and get your method
down it could be even more fun but I
also feel like this is not worth it I
mean I'm kind of up in the air about it
I think it's amazing for if you have
really sparse brows but then at the same
time once you apply them it's really
hard to maneuver them into place and to
really get them to sit where you want
them to sit I love it if it works and if
I get it to work right but if it doesn't
work like I wanted to it's one of the
biggest fails cuz it looks like pubes on
your brows it's pretty time-consuming
for such little effect I don't know what
do you think let me know in the comment
section down below what you think of
this for those of you wanting to know
the retail price this retails for twenty
two dollars and fifty four cents do I
think you have to immediately go to your
laptop and order this No so that is my
opinion and definitely let me know yours
and that brings me to today's winter
wonder winner the final winter wonder
winner I mean I did order one extra so
I'm definitely giving away this extra
one for you to try so remember that
Sephora gift card I gave away yesterday
