how I like to sculpt and fill in my
brows nowadays this is an updated
eyebrow routine because many of you have
noticed over the last couple of months
that I have changed them up a tiny
little bit today I'm going to show you
my favorite way of filling in my brows
to make them look more full and hairy
and bushy and just more like an actual
eyebrow instead of just a space of
nothing if you would like to know how I
did these brows then please keep on
watching so I personally always do brows
after foundation and before my eyes it's
because I work with concealer and
everything and I don't want the
concealer to mess up with my pretty
eyeshadows so these are my brows in
their natural straight or poor things
and the first products I'm going to go
in with is my Anasazi Beverly Hills brow
Wiz and I'm using the color taupe so the
first thing I always like to do is brush
all my brow hairs down and this way I
can exactly see the line at the top of
my brow now what I'm going to do with
this is trace that line create a new
line on top of the top of my eyebrow and
this will give the brow a nice structure
so with my brow is I just start defining
the top of my brow
then once I get to the arch I flick it
out once I've defined the top I brush
all my brow hairs back up and now we can
really clearly see the light underneath
and all we want to do now is do the same
at the top we just want to trace that
line and and just need to knit up a
little bit so again with my brows I'm
just following the brow and the closer
you get to the front of your brow the
softer you want to use that brow wiz to
fill this all in I like using something
a little bit more hardcore for this I'm
using my Anasazi beverly hills dipbrow
and this is also in the color taupe and
I literally use the tiniest bit of this
dip brow ever I just take the dip brow
just the dip brow and I literally tap it
in a couple of times and that's it I do
not scoop product out I do not brush the
brush into the product I literally tap
it on top of the surface of the dip brow
a couple of times and that is more than
enough
so I'm tapping it in and then filling in
in between the lines and the brush I'm
using is Anastasia Beverly Hills number
12 and again the closer you get to the
front of the brow the softer you want to
go a little trick I do is once I get to
the front I flick the product upwards so
on this part of the brow I go sideways
but on the front of the brow I go
upwards and just flick that color in and
give yourself the definition at the
front of your brow and I like bringing
it in a little bit further than you
think you would because once you do that
I now take my foundation brush where I
applied my foundation with and then just
lightly with that foundation brush just
tap the front of the brow and that will
soften the beginning of that brow and
therefore taking it in a little bit
further than you think you would and
then going in with that foundation brush
just gives it a really nice natural fade
once I've got it all sculpted and feel
in I'm now going in with brow gels the
first one I'm using is by Tarte and this
is the Amazonian clay tinted brow gel in
taupe and it has a really tiny teeny
brush which I love for defining the
front of my brow so we got that fade
going on right now but with this you can
really coat the hairs and give them a
little bit of a tint and that will make
it look more natural so with the brow
gel I just caught the front hairs of my
brow now for the remainder of my brow I
take my Anasazi really Hills clear brow
gel and just coat the entire rest of my
brow and be extra careful not to push
this brush outside your outline of the
brow because that will fudge up your
outline and that will make it look less
neat
so we sculpted we gelled it all down and
now it's time to carve the brows out I
like doing this because I can really get
that precise brow line I can fix up any
boo-boos I made I love carving up my
brows with concealer it just makes it
look so perfect so the concealer I love
for this is Anasazi roughly Hills
concealer in point 5 this is their
lightest shade and it's amazing so I
just pick up a little bit with a
concealer brush and then just carve out
the bottom of my brow and I can really
shape it with that also I use most
concealer right underneath my arch and
then the further I go to the sides the
less concealer I use now for years and
years I stopped here I thought this was
absolutely amazing but to give your
brows a little bit more of a natural
Harry feel sounds weird I'm going in
with the flawless brow trio by BH
Cosmetics and this is in the color I
don't think they have a color but this
is let me show you this is what it looks
like and the color I love using for this
is the middle one the center one right
here and for this I use the Giorgio
Armani brow angled liner brush and I
just tapped the brush into that powder
and then fill in any more blank spots of
the brow so right here I see it's a
little bit less pigmented I just fill it
in and then also what I love doing with
this is just draw in a couple of hairs
at the front of my brow and I feel like
that makes it so much more natural and
and real so with that same brush I just
flick in a couple of hairs at the front
of my brow and this way people with no
eyebrows a really sparse eyebrows can
have full eyebrows too and that guy's is
how I like to sculpt and fill in my
brows nowadays my updated eyebrow
