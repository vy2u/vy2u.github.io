of like a random hull also before I
start this is my 200 this video I cannot
pronounce that so just I'm sorry for
butchering it I cannot believe that this
is my 200 v video I am so like wow wow I
wanted to do a really special video with
like my intros and my funny parts and my
goodbyes and then all that stuff so sort
of like one big video of the all the 200
videos combined actually in a couple of
weeks
it is my 4 year anniversary on YouTube
so that video will go live with my 4
year anniversary so keep an eye out for
that so today I am going to do sort of
like a random haul I have some nail
polishes I have a makeup I have clothes
so I'm just gonna show you all because I
did some big-ass shopping lately I did
it with my brother that sounded way too
wrong ill and went shopping with my
brother I went shopping with my best
friend I went shopping all alone because
I'm such a loner so a couple of days ago
I went to Mac and I got a couple of
things and the first thing I want to
show you is this Mac blush and this is
from their hey sailor collection and
this is called launch away and this is a
powder set in blush this is absolutely
gorgeous I'm wearing it on my cheeks
right now it's really natural / peachy
and it's sort of like a light skin tone
color but just a little bit fresher and
better I gotta be honest I don't like
the packaging of the ACE Taylor
collection is just it's not doing it for
me like the stripes that from the best
jingo collection I got the embrace me a
lip pencil and this is a neon lip pencil
look at that it is neon and this is
absolutely insane also online from the
best data collection I ordered feel like
pastel yellow nail polish and the nude
of course lipstick but that hasn't
arrived yet so it did order that money
here again then also I discovered an
amazing new lipstick which is actually
in the permanent collection it which is
always a good moment because I always
fall in love with new lipsticks from a
limited edition collection and it just
bugs me so much because then I start
loving it more and more and then it's
gone and I think like 90% of years of
notes is already but this is you
lipstick by Mac and I'm wearing it today
and it is so gorgeous it's a really kind
of sheer shiny nude lipstick is a little
bit to share if you wanted to be an
opaque like nude lip so I put some lip
erase underneath then I also went to
English I was a judge for the English
summer look contest which was so much
fun I got to be one of the three judges
so I ended up buying some great in love
products this is the palette that I
designed myself I absolutely love it I
am a huge huge fan of the English shine
eyeshadows those are so so so gorgeous
when I was at the Inglot a summer of the
contest one finalist didn't show up so
we had one free model so I did her
makeup and the model was so gorgeous
this is the makeup I did and I used this
color in the crease and this is the
matte three for one and I used to dinner
a crease and it was so soft yet it gave
her definition and it was so pretty and
I was so like love at first sight with
it but also got four pigments and I love
in love pigments I even think that I
like their pigments more than their
shine up shy goes i make no sense I'm
gonna start off with my favorite which
are the body pigments and body payments
are like bright as hell and so pretty
and that and pigmented and it's so
gorgeous this is number 174 which is a
bright coral orange pigment and 126
which is sort of like a coral pink
bright pigment I also got number 180
pigment and number 79 in a
actually wearing that on my eyes today
79 is on my eyelids and number 180 is on
my inner corners I totally forgot that
neck I got the cleansing oil because I
saw a Merrik sea or ellison she put it
in her favorites and I was like okay I
gotta get that please guys to help me I
got this I tried it out and it doesn't
work on me I cannot get my water proof
mascara off with this and my my vision
gets all blurry after and I'm like haha

waterproof mascara because I cannot get
