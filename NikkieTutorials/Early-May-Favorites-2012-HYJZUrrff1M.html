the item number one of the may favorites
which is the jewel mint briar beauty
necklace oh and I thought the Destiny's
got Lee here on YouTube had it as well
and I was like sisters no
Destiny's ducked a beautiful girl and
she makes awesome videos so go check her
out then an inside of my one that's
about is this fuss for watch now I know
half of YouTube's beauty community has
been talking about this so here I am
doing it as well I am obsessed before I
went to New York like two weeks before I
went to New York the thoughts were
emailed me like capable of your videos
we have these amazing watches and can we
send you one I was like dog I love free
stuff free stuff is me happy I love this
watch you guys it is amazing I wore it's
you a schiphol airport in amsterdam and
i got so many girls and flights
attendants telling me oh my god that
watch is gorgeous I've never seen that
before you know what the cool thing is
about it if you press the top button you
get the time you see the time then if
you click the bottom button you get the
seconds one thing that I did notice just
when you turn it off like this hot
button and then it goes off 10 hours
later it goes on again so when I turn it
off at like 8:00 at night at 8:00 in the
morning it starts going but it put it up
again so a little tip is that before you
go to bed turn it on and then turn it
off again and then the next morning you
won't wake up from the phone but I love
this for watching the color is amazing I
love the white with the rose gold and
the Diamonds in it are a girl's best
friend phosphor told me that I could
give you guys a discount if you want
this this is two hundred and twenty-five
dollars but if you use to coat Nicky
30 Nicky 30 you can get 30% off on this
watch so definitely go check that out
and this is a touch of silk by Hana this
is sort of like a moisturizer slash
primary slash lock inner you use touch a
silk right after you put your
moisturizer on and this is as the name
says it's a touch of silk really like
literally if you put this on your face
that looks like that your face turns
into like a silk dress it turns into
a magic carpet I am wildly obsessed with
the touch of Shilpa Hana
it is and the best thing is that in July
my mum will start selling this so keep
an eye out for that once it's on I will
definitely tweet about it but really
magic carpet face everyone wants that oh
my god there's like a big humungous hair
on my lens let's get that out of there
recently I have been up cest with
glitters I did a prom I did a picture
perfect for prom video and I did glitter
eyeliner when I did that I was like oh
this is actually really pretty I like
the effect so much that the day after I
started playing with glitter liner the
day after that I started playing with
glitter eyeliner so I wore all different
type of glitter liners throughout the
week and I build up some favorites
because oh I love glitter so much the
glitter said I've been really loving are
by lit cosmetics and um these are I
showed you these in my New York haul as
well but it has amazing cars you guys
they have such a wide for everything
that there's such a wide for it for you
everything that biography English sucks
they have amazing colors and some of my
favorites are cowgirl which is a really
really nice a bronzy based home color
now this is a whole different story
this is soul sister and soul sister is a
duochrome it is green with bronze and
gold in it it is a whole different
experience then this one is no doubt
which is a neon pink gorgeous as hell
I mean neon glitter do I have to say
more LS it at least is Marilyn Monroe
and Marilyn Monroe is so gorgeous it is
so pretty it's just your average type
silver glitter but it's thicker than the
normal glitter we all have is thicker
and more beautiful next to see at a nail
polish in halo this is the bomb
I have wow this is a dual chrome effect
polish like in the bottle you're like
okay this looks weird you sting because
my mom sells the attain or webshop I
always have to swatch the colors for her
and she was the odor is something flying
then I put it on on my bare finger and I
was like okay you're actually really
pretty but because it is a dual chrome
and when you put dual crumbs on a black
dark base they really pop so I took my
black nail polish and I put this on top
and literally my brain needed a couple
of minutes to process all of that I mean
just look at the beautiful gorgeous
immense color it is insane you have a
purple you have the pink and green it's
like having four nail polishes in one I
love it okay last but not least my
favorite favorite foundation brush I've
had this for months now but I never
really used it hey mommy this is the
sadhana lays flat top foundation brush
this it's so good at busting the
foundation like magic it makes my
healthy skin phone eggs when you're
