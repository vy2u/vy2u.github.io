Halloween tutorial of 2012 Bloody Mary
um this is actually super duper easy you
could go even crazier than this and just
at your greasy hair white gown with
blood on it and just make yourself look
dead and bloody so yeah if you want to
know how to get this a Bloody Mary look
then please keep on watching ok so my
skin is a little bit bad at the moment
but um I don't care it's Bloody Mary so
my skin could be bloody and not marry at
all so I'm going to start up with
Foundation and I'm gonna go lighter than
my skin tone the foundations that we'll
be using are my illamasqua light liquid
foundation in 115 a little bit of my Mac
say somebody see one and just a little
tiny bit of mission nail perfection
Lumiere in number 12
okay then I'm going to go over with some
concealer and i'm using my OCC
concealers in yellow zero and yellow one
I don't really have to cover up your
dark circles because you're making them
red and sort of bloody anyways in the
end but it kinda I don't know it kind of
makes me
Zen in my head when I don't see my dark
circles anymore
and I'm not just gonna set the entire
thing with a powder okay so I went ahead
and did my eyebrows and one side of my
face um let's do the other side for a
base of my eyelids I'm going to use my
Mac soft ochre Paint Pot now I'm going
to take makeup geeks gel liner in poison
so fitting for this tutorial or not
maybe she should have called it blood II
Mary huh and I'm just applying this to
my lids as a base then I'm going to make
a mixture between mechs a sweet chestnut
eyeshadow and these two reds from the
makeup studio 18 color eye shadow
palette and just set your eyelids with
this then I'm going to take my feet
start I shadow palette I'm going to take
the warm colors in the middle and start
defining my crease with that and I'm
going to go all the way in and I'm going
to blend all of this out using my red
colors from my lid again so from the
makeup studio eighteen color eyeshadow
palette then I'm going to darken my
crease making it look more Hollow with a
black and a dark brown eyeshadow and
just keep blending it into the mix
I'm going to highlight my brow bone
using Mac's nano gold and this has a
gorgeous pink shine to it and this is
perfect did you stay in the theme of the
Reds and also highlight your inner
corners with that and then making my
lids red again for the bottom from my
face art eyeshadow Pelin going to use
this one and this brown one I love that
you don't have to be like super super
neat with this look it kind of all ties
together once you at the blood and to
darken my under-eye circles I'm just
going to take this color and a little
bit of the Mac sweet chestnut basically
start going crazy under your eyes making
yourself look really sick I'm going to
line my waterline using NYX Brown
perfections to light on pencil and
another applying any mascara so I'm just
gonna curl my lashes only okay for my
cheeks I'm first gonna contour with my
NYX blush in taupe and make it a little
bit darker with my C's art palette and
that color right there and go ahead and
make this a really really strong shape /
contour
don't be afraid go to your temples and
I'm even going to give it a red tint by
using my illamasqua blush and kiss
we're a highlight I'm using my mech
lightscapade skinfinish and nano gold
eyeshadow just going right there under
my eye highest point up on cheek also
above my brow and my nose and then with
this cat cosmetics light powder I'm just
going to highlight some points of my
face so under my shape my concerts make
it stronger and sort of in the middle of
my face to make it more white okay it's
finally time to go crazy and Bloody Mary
it's time for the blood birth of blood
I'm going to make a mixture between may
Ron's stage blood and coagulated blood
and just kind of play with it I'm gonna
place most blood of course coming from
my eyes because she stabbed her eyes out
I haven't touched this bluff for over a
year and I'm home honey
