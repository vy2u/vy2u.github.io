doing another installment of my RuPaul's
Drag Race inspired series this week's
winner for me was miss fame with her
roaring 1920s flapper girl look I love
this look just not the brows let's do it
before I do anything this was the look
from the tutorial let's now change it up
I don't know how oh oh my god this is so
much better skip them brows I'm gonna
cut that out of the tutorial anyways if
you want to see how to get this look -
the brows because I left them out then
please stay tuned alright so I know I
look absolutely crazy right now but
let's get started I already went ahead
and did my base and blocked up my
eyebrows just to save some time and I've
been showing you how I do my drag base
my foundation and everything in my past
video so if you want to see how I did
that then please watch those videos too
as the you know adds reference just
check them out first thing I'll be doing
now is grabbing my Mac soft ochre Paint
Pots and I'll be using this to prime and
just as a base get away with them
creases now I'm going to go ahead and
cut the crease and for this I'll be
using Mac's a lip pencil in Burgundy and
then now it's time to work on that very
explosive pink haze around the eyes I'm
first taking this eyeshadow by Mac and
this is called feather pink and just
with a very big fluffy blending brush
above where we drew the new crease I'm
going to blend and haze this out
you want this to be super big super
blown out and hazy and especially here
on that outer corner is where you want
it to be most intense
I covered my brows for this look so you
actually want to go over top of your
actual brows with sugar pills poison
plum I'm going to define that crease so
placing your brush on that new crease
line with poison plum and blending
up and out and you actually want to go
all the way to the inner corners that
inner part of your eye to give it that
sunken-in feel just go ahead and blend
this all out
not taking sugar pills dolly pop and
just further blending out this entire
situation I'm now highlighting my brow
bone using a white powder this one is by
Ben Nye it's super wide powder now for
the lower lash line I already started a
little bit sorry
taking dolly pop a sugar pill again and
just a muted Brown pinky rose color and
I'm just going to cut out a piece a
little portion of my lower lash line to
leave that bear his later on we're going
to place the white there and that will
open up the eyes dramatically I already
went ahead and did the base for that and
I'm just going to continue on towards
the end of my lower lash line and then
with poison plum and that same dusty
rose brown color I'm going to define
that outer portion a whole lot and I'm
going to connect this to the top portion
right here just connect it
and remember you really want that
sunken-in feel so I'm again taking dolly
Papa sugar pill and feather pink by Mac
and really putting that pink on my inner
corners let's work on the lid so for the
lid of first taking this lovely pigment
by makeup geek this is called insomnia
and as I've been saying in all my drag
tutorials with this you can really cut
that crease and give it the shape that
you want and then I'm going to have a
glitter party on my lids so I'll be
mixing three glitters onto my eyelids
the first one in the middle is by OCC
this is Faye I'll also be using 3d gold
by Mac and brown diamond by makeup
studio and then first with Faye in the
center look that hello then grabbing
brown diamond by makeup studio going
right next to it oh yes and then 3d gold
by Mac sort of in between the two to
blend it out oh my god I love it
alright I'm just gonna let that there
over a little bit alright now I'm going
to open up the eyes using some white on
that blank spot for the blink but right
here alright so that is looking pretty
good I'm now going to do my eyeliner
just a really easy winged eyeliner make
it thick and dramatic it's traumatic and
that's it for now just go ahead and do
that
all right I'm going to do now is apply
falsies off-camera because I cannot do
it on camera
for lips I'm going to give it a little
bit of my own twist but I'm again taking
sad girl liquid lipstick by uh necessity
verbally I look so crazy with these
eyebrows
and then just on the center of my bottom
lip I'm going to just watch
taking a little bit of black dahlia lip
tar by OCT for a class over top him
taking on associate beverly hills venom
lip gloss
for blush I'm taking the bulbs down boy
and I of course need my clothes I'm
taking moonstone by Becca alright so I
think it's time to put a wig on and look
even more crazy this okay let's go
