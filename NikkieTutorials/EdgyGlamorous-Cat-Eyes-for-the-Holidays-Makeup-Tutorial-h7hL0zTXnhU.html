tutorial and this was created for the
holidays I got so many requests and
comments like okay Nikki we've seen
everyone do gold eyes and red lips or
winged eyeliner and new lips and we're
over it we want something different for
the holiday people kind of made it seem
like I was there like last Savior so
today I decided to come up with a
somewhat more graphic edgy holiday
silicon where it's for Christmas or New
Year's Eve it's a really pretty winged
look which is with the sharp crease it's
kind of graphic but with the glitter and
then the peachy lips and a really
beautiful glowing skin it's really
feminine and girly and glamorous umm so
if you want to know how to get this then
please keep on watching so the first
thing I'm going to do is apply a base
tier I list to prevent the eyeshadow
from creasing and the one I'm using for
that is my Mac soft ochre paper I will
now be taking my Bobbi Brown rich
chocolate palette and we'll be taking
these two colors to map out my eyeliner
and shape so I'm taking those two colors
and I'm going to start defining my lower
lash line really close to the roots and
then once you get to the inner corner
you kind of want to leave a gap to open
up the eyes a bit more
and then from there map out where you
want your liner to go to and then once
you have that line kind of connected to
where you would place your eyeliner just
so you don't get confused later on so
for this step is to do your bottom lid
and then wing it out the way you want to
wing it out and in the way that fits
your eye shape and again don't be too
afraid with this because it's quite a
graphic and bold look now we'll be
taking my makeup forever aqua cream in
number two and I'm applying this as a
base for my pigment later on important
is that you apply it over the entire
eyelid
so important is that you touch that
liner that you just placed and that it's
an even coverage now I'm going to take
sweet Sienna pigment by Mac and apply
that on top okay now it's time to map
out your crease our furthest out we
using this shade right here and this to
blend it out and this to deepen it okay
so what you want to do is from that
eyeliner line swoop it into the crease
like that
fill it up a little bit and just really
easily follow the curve of your crease
and stop about halfway of your iris then
take some more and straighten it out so
the curve is not so deep and then also
wing it out a cat little bit more okay
then this fade that in a little bit more
not too much stop they're not going to
take a softer color and go a little bit
above that and make soft stroke motions
to give it a softer feeling and to add a
little bit of a purple touch I'm going
to add some forgiveness I should avoid
illamasqua and you just want to place
that shadow right here at the deepest
point
I would call it the glitter I will be
using is by makeup studio and this is
called cosmetic glimmer effects in brown
diamond and I absolutely love this one
and I'm going to mix it with my lit
clearly liquid glitter base so I'm going
to mix it two together and that sort of
becomes a gel glitter glitter gel and
that is what you apply to your lids and
that will give an amazing glitter touch
and then apply that to a valid and just
look how gorgeous that is and remember
to Pat it on if you smear the glitter on
you will have followed like no other so
pack it on and just forgot you guys look
at that oh look at that when I'm out of
frame you can really see the sparkle of
the oh god I love it on the inner corner
I'm adding a bit of my favorite jewel X
in shine by makeup studio and what I'm
doing with this is I blend it towards
the beginning of the crease on the
waterline I'm applying some Catrice made
to stay inside I highlighter pen and not
to grew out the look a little bit more
I'm applying my ichael liquid metal
eyeliner in black onyx and why I'm doing
is this because I'm like this the look
is a little bit it looks unfinished it
needs something to ground it and make it
more wearable and I feel like the black
liquid liner really grounds it and makes
it look good so I'm just going to add a
simple winged eyeliner to the eye and
then it's grounded
so once you have the liner on all you
want to do is apply some mascara and
false lashes and the false lashes that
we'll be using are by Miss adoro and
these are the number 42 s and I'm just
going to take the outer half and put
that on the outer half of my eyelids as
well so you sort of have that cat eye
going on so I bet isn't going to do
right now and then it'll be back so I
already went ahead and did some
contouring and for that I used my
illamasqua eyeshadow in heroine to warm
up my face a little bit more I will be
using my new tambour dranzer by Mac and
just really lightly nothing too drastic
I mean it's the holidays it's cold
outside if you don't live in Australia
New Zealand they're for blush I already
applied some I'm sorry I just I got too
excited and I already did it
what I applied are my NARS blushes in
Jena and lustre I applied Gina for the
color and luster for a third of the
shine and the glow and the magic and
then of course no holiday look would be
complete without some glow to the face
so what I'm going to use is a vanilla
pigment by neck and just it's the
holidays you want to look glowy you want
to look perfect so I'm gonna go for
vanilla pigment boom bitch yeah oh my
god damn is everywhere oh god it's on my
toes okay so for lips this look has
endless possibilities you could go for a
classic red to make it a little bit more
Christmasy you could act like a shocking
bright pink for a little bit more of a
New Year's Eve touch I personally I love
these eyes I absolutely love them and I
want all my attention to go to the eyes
so I'm going to keep the lips somewhat
more nude so I'm first going to line
them with my favorite Bobby Brown pale
pink lip liner then on one part of my
lip I'm going to add my favorite
lipstick pure decoration by Mac which is
a beautiful nude color but because I
wanted somewhat more of a peach pop I'm
going to take my nurse a Velvet Matte
lip pencil in Valero and apply that to
the other part half of my lip and
smack the lips together and then
hopefully something pretty comes out if
not I will just have to work with it I
guess
