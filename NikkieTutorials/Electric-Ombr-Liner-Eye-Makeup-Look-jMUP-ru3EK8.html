tutorial on this I look right here this
is also the look that I was wearing in
my previous video you guys went crazy
over this look and thank you so much for
requesting it because I think it is
great for spring and summer because
ombre eyeliner is awesome by the way
does he got me hooked on this game she
talked about this game in one of her
recent videos and I am obsessed so the
game I'm talking about is pearls peril
and it was already available on Facebook
and on the iPad but it's now available
for the iPhone too and I am hooked so
the game is about pearl and pearls
father recently died and her father had
this island so she travels to this
island and on this island you can play
all these games and my favorite one is
where you have to you see this sort of
room or space and then in the bottom of
the game it says what you have to look
for and then on the game you have to
press on the thing you're looking for
and the quicker you find the objects the
more points you get so here you can see
I'm on a beach and right here you can
see all the things that you have to look
for in the picture so the first one is a
pineapple and I know the pineapple is
right here it's just such a fun game and
I'm obsessed
anyway it's without any further ado if
you want to know how to get this sword
adhered then please keep on watching
so first things first I'm going to prime
my eyelids using Mac soft ochre Paint
Pot for my crease today I'll be using
Anasazi Beverly Hills a warm taupe
eyeshadow and I'm focusing this mainly
on the outer corner and outer crease so
just with a blending brush start buffing
that in and then also slightly winged
the outer portion out a little bit on
the little be using on the size of Urkel
heels
amber eyeshadow and first I'm laying
this down using my finger because I like
how pigmented it goes on using fingers
and then with a brush I'm just making
sure that it goes all the way to the
inner corner and it blends out into the
crease for the lower lash line I'm again
taking warm taupe and mix
it with cognac or however you pronounce
that and you want to place this morsel
on the outer portion of the lower
lashline because on this inner portion
we will create a new inner corner now
let's actually work on that new inner
corner I'm going in and use my cavity
tattoo liner in trooper and I'm just
creating a line coming out from the
inner corners then from the tip of that
line bring it back on to the waterline
and then go ahead and fill in then also
now is the time to create the rest of
your wing so I'm going to start off by
creating a line here and that will
determine the angle of my winged
eyeliner and the from that line go back
onto your lid and remember to not bring
that black all the way to the inner
corners because that is where the blue
on rate will happen so now going in with
my black liquid liner by NYC and I'm
just filling in this portion right here
the now it's time for the fun part I'm
taking this on associatively Hills
waterproof green color in ice blue and
this will be our first color for the
ombre liner
the next color is going to be ocean and
this is going right in between ice blue
and the black
you want to taper the edges into the
color next to it and then same goes for
the black you just want to whisk the
ocean into the black and then to make
the black smooth again take black
eyeshadow and go over top and blend out
now with an angled brush and cognac only
I'm creating a parallel lying to the
line on the inner corner right in
between the two I'm applying makeup
sitios jewel effects and shine
off-camera I'll be applying a white
eyeliner to my waterline and adds a
finish off the look all I'm going to do
is apply mascara and falsies and the
falsies today are going to be the iconic
whoa the lashes are going to be iconic
by house of lashes for cheeks the first
thing I'll be doing is of course a
little bit of contouring so for this
I'll be using my Kevin eat at UNO for
this I'll be using my Kat Von D shade
and light palette
for bronzer my L'Oreal glam bronze in
number one for blush Malati's Luminoso
and to highlight amusing Becca's
moonstone and that's it for the cheeks
for lips I kept it very simple I'm first
going in with my NYX Cosmetics lip liner
in natural for lipstick Mac Smith
afraid glass i'ma so severely Hills
undressed
