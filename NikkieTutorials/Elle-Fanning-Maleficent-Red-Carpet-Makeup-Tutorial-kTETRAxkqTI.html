tutorial inspired by Elle Fanning at the
Maleficent premiere premiere from her
home so L looked absolutely amazing I
love how high fashioned yet still very
neutral and natural her makeup was she
was rocking these huge blown out orange
eyes which are very in right now because
orange is the trend right now and then
pink on the cheeks and pink on the lips
and just a really natural sort of
high-fashion look which anyone can rock
this summer I even went with the bun so
yeah we got that going so if you want to
know how to get this really nice
wearable Elle Fanning at the Maleficent
red-carpet premiere look which is also
really nice for summer because it
includes that orange that's been really
huge right now then please keep on
watching so the first thing I'll be
using is my L'Oreal Lumi magique base
primer and I'm gonna apply this all over
my complexion and this product has an
amazing Sheen to it so it will give you
that beautiful luminous glow for my
foundation gonna make a mixture with my
L'Oreal True Match in n1 and a fun thing
I discovered about an article on
Angelina Jolie on the set of Maleficent
is that she wore Mac's
a select cover up concealer as a
foundation this little dude right here
didn't break her out it worked perfectly
with the prosthetics and it just looked
perfect on camera so what I'm going to
do is mix the two together and give me
that flawless base and I'm using a
makeup geek Foundation stippling brush
and I've been really liking this for my
foundation lately you can really buff it
into the skin I really sort of make it
seamlessly flawless eyewall got ideas it
just blends into foundation so
beautifully without really trying I
absolutely love it it's becoming a
strong contender for my Mac 159 okay so
once we've got that looking gorgeous I'm
going to apply some concealer and I'm
going for my Pro Longwear concealer by
Mac in nc15 and I'm also going to
further highlight my face a bit with a
Mac prep and prime highlighter in
radiant rose
and I'm going for this sort of Halfmoon
shape under my eyes because it looks
prettier and was it look like a complete
full lung and a buffeting with my Real
Techniques sponge
okay I'm not quickly gonna do my brows
off-camera and I'm gonna use my
Anastasia brow Wiz in ash blonde for
that and I will do an updated robber
teen very soon so hold on to that and
I'll probably come back with one eye
done as well to pair my eyelids I'll be
using my usual soft ochre Paint Pot by
Mac the first eyeshadow we'll be using
is Peach Smoothie by makeup geek and
I'll be applying Peach Smoothie as my
transition color so with a big blending
brush I'm just going to dust set it into
the inner part of my crease and blending
out to the outer part and this will help
to blend the shadows really nicely later
on now I'm going to make a mixture of
makeup geeks goddess eyeshadow and Coco
bear and then applying those two right
here in my crease blending into the
middle I'm going to blend it up with
Peach Smoothie and because Peach
Smoothie is already there it just
gradually fades into it look down and
also take my outer part my outer V of my
eye and then to give it a little bit
more of a peachy orange twist and I take
makeup geeks Mango Tango and just really
lightly with again that big brush I'm
going to add this to the crease but
really lightly for the bottom I'm going
to take goddess and Coco bear again and
trace it along my lower lash line and on
L it looked absolutely gorgeous and
smokey and diffused so don't be afraid
to blend this down now with my favorite
highlighting shade I'm going to
highlight my brow bone and inner corners
of my eye for the little bit taking one
of my favorite pigments by makeup geek
and this is afterglow I'm first going to
apply it with my finger straightly onto
the lids because you can really get that
impact with your fingers and then I like
to go in with a more concentrated brush
and really pack it on for my inner
corner highlight I'll be taking this
amazingly gorgeous color by Lancome this
is the
hombre Hypno's eyeshadow iridescent
color this is I 102 the teats Dulce
deuce deuce do this I don't know what I
do know is that it's a gorgeous color
and with this I'm really sparkling up
and opening up my inner corners I mean
come on that is gorgeous
to open up my eyes a little bit more I'm
gonna take my Ben Nye neutralizer cream
crayon in ultra light and apply this to
the waterline
not to define the lashes and grab the
look a little bit more I'll be taking my
liquid liner my favorite this is the
liquid liner by Catrice called dating
Joe black and I'm just going to add the
tiniest smallest line to the roots of my
lashes and just in the middle so you
want to start at the middle of your eye
and then work your way out but don't go
all the way to the inner and outer
corner just ground to look a little bit
more so that your lashes get a little
bit more fullness and definition and to
finish this look off all you need is
some mascara and I'm going to use my
makeup studio waterproof 3d in extra
black and on top a little bit of Mac's
extended play gigablack lash for ticks
you can go it's a little bit of
sculpting because I think that everyone
looks a little bit more structured and
better with a little of sculpting so I'm
gonna contour my face using my
Illamasqua eyeshadow in heroine and then
for cheeks you want to go with a really
cool toned bright pink because that
looks fabulous with the sort of more
orangie tones on the eyes so for that
I'll be using Mac's love cloud and I'm
starting mainly on the outer part of my
face and then once everything is sort of
applied there a stupid onto the Apple
and then I like to take my foundation
brush again and sort of tap the edges to
really blend it in nicely so highlight
I'll be using my favorite this is max
extra dimension I shadow in a natural
flirt and just on the highest points of
your face
her lips you want to go for a really
natural sort of nude bitten look and I
absolutely love that trend lately so
first gonna lie my lips using my Lacombe
look oh look oh look on tour lip liner
by Lancome and this is 211 beige rose
and then I also like to fill in the lip
lightly for lipstick and then aleeah's
Chanel's 217 Vergil or in a lady youth
and then on the inside of her lip she
had a really nice pop of red coral so
for that I'll be using mica trees
what the hell is this called breath out
I'll be using my Catrice lipstick in
color bomb color bomb and I'm just gonna
tap that on the inside rim of my lip
that sounds disgusting and that guys
