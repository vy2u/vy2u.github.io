tutorial slash my take on the new estee
lauder vivid shine campaign / @ / visual
I love this I was browsing through the
Dutch folk and I was like huh tutorial I
just really love everything about it
it's a really nice extreme smoky eye
before we start let's just try the pose
close enough I think I hope so so yeah
this is just gonna be my take on the new
estee lauder visual for vivid shine I
love the makeup and if you want to know
how I got this then please keep on
watching so the first thing you want to
do as always it's a Pawnee base to your
eyelids to prevent the eyeshadow from
creasing and the one I'm using is Mac
soft ochre Paint Pot now I'm gonna
define my crease with mixed powder
roasted and fake one I'm just gonna
define my crease with this on the visual
the model has a really really nice
almond deep-set ice so they went all the
way in I have a hooded eyelids but I
don't care I love it when they go all
the way in so I'm gonna go all the way
in as well gross
now gonna mix power now gonna mix power
boost it with Mac's the feather pink and
with this I'm gonna blend the crease and
go up and this crease is not for the
people who want a nice everyday purple
look because this is the nut everyday
now I'm gonna connect the bottom to my
crease and blend
my man Liz I'm gonna make a mixture
between Max and twinks and I'm applying
that to the inner third of my eyelid up
to the first sort of border line of my
iris and on the outer third again like
leaning against my iris for the middle
of my eyelid I'm going to use this
pigment by makeup studio called emesis
and then just blend that towards twinks
and sketch now I'm just darkening my
crease up a little bit more with the
sketch and fig 1 and with feather pink
I'm just making the edges a little bit
more pink and a little bit more blended
okay for the bottom I'm taking sketch
and twinks again and I'm going quite low
with this then right here below I'm
adding a little bit more power boost at
the purple because I'm a visual you can
see that really on this part right here
it's so purple so I'm doing that as well
for a crazy inner corner highlight I'm
using that makeup studio pigment in
amethyst again
for mentally I'm not gonna do a touch of
Nikki I am pretty sure this was not on
this visual I'm gonna add a pop of
glitter to the middle of my oh my god Oh
glitter all over my death Oh
feels like catch us here I'm gonna add a
pop of glitter to my eyelids do you just
make the middle of my eyelids a little
bit more like luxurious and sexy and
this is makeup studios cosmetic glimmer
effects in brown diamonds and as a
mixing medium I'm using my lip cosmetics
clearly liquid base and just on the
middle of the lid okay for my waterline
I used my Ben Nye neutralizer cream
crayon in red concealer number one mp3
and then for mascara I am going to use
my trusty old makeup studio waterproof
3d extra black and then to separate my
lashes a little bit more I'm gonna use
my makeup studio false lash effect for
addy and this is also going on to my
bottom lashes a bit so I'm gonna do
mascara right now and then it will be
back now for the lips it's totally
optional you can stop right here put
some new lipstick on and rock some
purple smokey eyes but because I want to
recreate the Estee Lauder thing they
used a really nice red pink lipstick and
a shiny one so it's quite hard to find
that exact color and the best I could
come up with was necks brick lip pencil
and then on top this lipstick that Mac
describes it's a bright red pink so I
thought that's perfect and this is a
Moxie and I actually have a blog post on
this on my blog a review so I'm just
gonna apply the brick lip liner and then
Moxie on top
I'm gonna lipliners on now time to Deb
Moxie on top and especially in the
middle okay I think that's mainly to
color now gonna run some Elizabeth Arden
8 hour cream on top in the middle for
just a little bit of shine and I'm just
gonna perfect and conceal now to make my
edges and everything sharp and perfect
so be right back
all that I have left to do now is tell
you what is on my cheeks I contoured
with my NYX blush in taupe this is my
favorite to contour with then the blush
was quite high on the cheeks and quite
far backwards to right here I applied a
mix of NYX blush in peach and I mix it a
little bit with Mac's pinch of peach and
because you know I can't live a day
without my highlight I use my girl a mid
Tod cruel gardenia highlighting powder
right here on the highest points of my
cheekbones and that's it that completes
my take on the Estee Lauder vivid shine
campaign picture one more time this is
