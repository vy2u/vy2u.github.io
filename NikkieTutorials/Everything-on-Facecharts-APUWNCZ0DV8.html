on how to use face charts now on Twitter
i always post twitpics of face charts
that i made just like a couple of
seconds before that and I always get
questions like how do you make them how
do you fill em in where do you get them
stuff like that so today I'm going to
show you how I feel in a face chart and
this is the one I made beware it's a
mess because I just wanted to be done
with it
but this is the filter that I made I was
inspired by shows of John Galliano and
all those artsy fartsy shows runway
shows so yeah this is just what I just
did on cameras I'm going to show you how
to do that and the basics are all
included is well a little note for all
the Mac people that are watching this
I'm so sorry because I know face charts
are a really big deal at Mac and you
really have to work with shadows and
stuff and I'm probably the biggest
insult ever for like doing this and
they're like oh that sucks so for all
the Mac people watching this I'm so
sorry that this is totally not up your
alley like all the MEK people Rock FA
shirts because they have to rocket it up
Mac um so yeah other than that if you
want to know how to use pay charts where
to get them and stuff like that then
please keep on watching as you can
probably tell this is my Kim Kardashian
face chart for the goth tutorial that I
did
I just tried out what she was wearing
and just wanted to see if it worked out
I made the liner a bit more there but I
left it out in the video itself um so
yeah this is just a Kim Kardashian face
her that I did and this is how it looked
on me
then I also have this patch are called
red vixen and this one is going to be
filmed tomorrow on myself but that is
just a little like how you can do with
this is just what's coming up this face
chart was made when I was still doing
the makeup course at B Academy and this
was for my in-between shoot so you after
like six weeks we had to do our first
photo shoot and I decided to play with
color so here is the mood board for it
I love the makeup studio ones because
the the touch of the paper the quality
of the paper is kind of rough so shadows
and stuff really grip onto it better
than just with a paper that you print on
also I like the eye better than the mech
ones because I feel like they always
look so cranky the Mac ones you're
always so grumpy
now with face charts the thing you do
with it is just put the makeup on that
you want to put on your face as well and
see if it's working out for you
face charts are often used for makeup
artists who want to see if colors match
if the technique works if color or if a
look matches with the lips often used
for fashion shows for when you have like
Fashion Week and one entire team has to
know what the look is and often then the
shift acai beam makes a face shirt and
then everyone can duplicate it okay so I
hope that that cleared a little bit up
on what face charts are for and how to
use them so right now I'm just going to
show you a quick look I have nothing in
mind so I'm just going to play with it
of course you want to use brushes for
face charts now for me personally this
is all up to you I love to work with
kind of harder brushes like steadier
like denser brushes my favorite is does
the h1 is just really sturdy and almost
hard so you can really get onto that
paper what I always like to start with
is somewhat of a creamy product to make
the shadow on top like really stick to
it so what I often do is start off with
eye pencils and blend that all into the
shape that I want and then just put
shadows on top to blend it even further
so today I'm going to show you how I'm
doing that my base color I'm going to
use is Amex Bordeaux line power point I
pencil it's a nice plummy color feeling
in a kind of colorful smokey artsy mood
so what I'm going to do is just make my
basic shape of the eye that I want and I
wanted
be nice and smoky underneath it's just
like a real eye it's just like you're
painting your own eye but instead of
having bones like dimension to work with
you have to put the dimension on the
paper because the paper is flat and then
from that point and going into the
crease I'm making it look good I'm just
going to take a brush I'm going to blend
it out until I like it you can see that
you're already kind of creating a
dimension on this paper like with
blending it out you're giving it like
that shadow this is kind of what you
want you want to put you want to like
make this paper look like a real eye and
I want to play with color so I'm going
to take a yellow eye pencil and put that
on the lid and I'm going over that with
the yellow shadow to set it in place
just just to show you how to have fun
with a face chart
and with the lips are just fill in the
face sharps mouth so that is how I like
to do my pate charts it's all up to you
what you like better to use it's just
kind of figuring out what you like or
not the makeup studio face charts that I
use are available at my mom's website
ahead schools make Spanish bins and l
dot nel something like that so yeah
that's it guys thinking of so much for
watching I hope you'll learn something
from it if you have any questions leave
them in the comment section below um
yeah so thank you I love you and
hopefully I will see you guys next time
