tutorial on this makeup look right here
and I am so excited about this look
because it has a little bit of drag
because of the entire new eyes I just
created
I love these chocolate kisses a brown
matte lips glowy skin perfect for the
holidays perfect for Christmas and I
just um mm-hmm this is also the first
video of my winter Wonder week this week
I will be uploading one video every day
for one week yeah I just hope you enjoy
and without any further ado let's go on
to the tutorial so it's Christmas and
you want your makeup to last all day
long so the first thing I'm gonna do is
prime I got a prime using my Nivea men
after shave love insensitive okay I
haven't set this in a long time so here
we go this contains glycerin as the
second most used ingredient and glycerin
makes products stick to it so when you
use this as a base the makeup will
really stick onto it making it last all
day long I've been a fan of this for
forever now and I've gotten so many
people to use this and trust me this
works and the goals that you only take a
little bit and start buffing it into the
skin and you want to keep buffing until
it starts feeling chakki so you'll feel
it being really liquidy when you first
apply it but then once you start
smoothing it in for like a minute it
becomes tacky that is what you want so
for me right now is really tacky and
that is perfect also can we say hi to
this face troll I have right here why I
want that flawless finish
so for foundation today I'm going to go
for my favorite Make Up For Ever
foundation Ultra HD Stix I apply 1:20 to
the outer perimeter of my face and 117
to the inner
and 117
and then with a Beautyblender I'm going
to start bouncing this in then for
concealer it cosmetics bye bye under-eye
in light my favorite and again
London using your Beauty Blender
and then setting everything with powder
to prevent it from creasing the first
thing I'll be applying to my eyes is my
Mac soft ochre Paint Pot to prevent my
eyes from creasing and I'm applying this
using a sigma 3d HD precision brush now
to help blending I'm going to set my
crease to brow bone area using a matte
nude shadow going into these you a
ready-to-wear worm palette I'm taking
the color Sahara and with an honest
hacer Beverly Hills blending brush I'm
applying that to the crease all you want
to do with this is just give your eyes
some definition because later on once
the wing is on we're going to go back in
with a darker color and really intensify
that so I'm just giving myself a
guideline here now I'm applying makeup
geeks Peach Smoothie and with that same
Anasazi Beverly Hills brush go ahead and
buff out that crease and this will
especially help if that beautiful
flawless blend and a little bit of warm
for my lid at first applying a tiny bit
of this color pop gel liner and this is
in the color exit and we're going to use
this as a base to really make that lid
pop
and immediately right after go in with a
match cream color and set it I'm also
playing that Mac Korean color to my
inner corners to open them up now for
the fun part the lower lash line first
we're going to start off with eyeliner
applying a point to the very inner
corners here to extend the eye and from
there we can create a liner and from
there we can create a whole new eye
shape and from the tip of the wing drag
it back onto the lash line now connect
the extended inner corner to the wing
and you've got yourself an outline now
of course you have to fill this all in
and for this I'm using my Sigma Legend
line ace now with that same g-way color
I apply to the crease you want to create
a line parallel to the eyeliner we just
created and this will create a new inner
corner I'm going to give them more depth
and strength using a medium brown matte
eyeshadow so now it's time to really
open up that eye using a white liquid
liner for this I'll be using my Sigma
one this is the line ace in endorsed and
to open up my eyes even more I'm
applying a white liner to my waterline
this is the same one by colour-pop it's
the same color exit but it's in a pencil
form now to really grab that new lower
lash line I'm using makeup geeks
Americano eyeshadow and just really
start adding definition to that new
lower lash line
now with that same Anasazi Breville eels
blending brush and americano just add a
tiny bit more defiant and it is the word
to the crease to finish off the look all
you want to do is apply some falsies and
today I'll be using the house of lashes
ikonics time to so lay these cheeks so
first I'm going to contour using my OG
Nix
taupe blush this has been forever since
I've used this and as I was like let's
go back to them old days honey so I'm
taking a Mac 168 168 to contour wood
then softly warm up the face a little
bit more using some bronzer this is my
Too Faced light medium chocolate bronzer
for highlighter we did it guys Becca
made pearl permanent it's now in a
full-sized powder compartment David
pearls permanent so I'll be using pearl
and with my morphe M 510 I'm just gonna
drizzle some beacons of light onto my
face I know it looks super crazy right
now but once you start blending in the
blush after and then for blush i'll be
using mac's peaches and applying that
with my F 37 brush by Sigma and to get
rid of that pancake look with all the
powders you want to spritz your face
using a makeup finishing setting spray
for lists we're going to go for the
chocolate kiss so I'll be using
Limbo by a color pop and we all know
that limbo is almost an exact dupe for
Kylie lip kit the true Brown k1 so if
you don't have the money or you missed
out on the Kylie lip kit into rum cake
you can get limbo bicolor pop and the
color is almost identical yet the
formulas are way different
but another color I found out about is
violet Voss
these are her liquid lipsticks and this
is the color excessive and this is just
a tad bit more Brown and darker than
limbo so I'm thinking I'm going to make
a nice mixture of the two so I'm
applying excessive by violet flaws first
you
and that guy's concludes this chocolate
kisses the makeup tutorial I have no
idea what I'm gonna call this yet so I'm
just gonna say chocolate kisses for a
