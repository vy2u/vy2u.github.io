extreme spring look I'm loving these
lately I gotta I just wanted to play
with color again and today I decided to
do this like Purple Haze is what I like
a purple cloud around your eyes and then
this piercing neon blue eyeliner I am
liking this I'm definitely gonna go out
in a sec with this I'm gonna scare my
mom she's gonna be like oh so fried like
I know if you want to go hard at this
then please keep on watching
okay so look like right now so
first you're going to do as always is
the pie based here I let super front the
eye shadow from creasing and you know
what I'm using but I'm gonna say it
anyways this is the Mac soft ochre Paint
Pot okay I'm not going to take mixes
jumbo pencil in milk and this is a white
creamy color and I'm just applying this
onto my lid and then blending it in with
my finger okay now I'm going to take
this beautiful pigment by a sugar pill
this is called paper doll it is insane
it's like a matte finish but with reflex
in it and glitters it's it's the bomb I
say that a lot of videos and I'm gonna
apply that color to the middle of my lid
and look at the texture the texture is
so unique it's like a matte finish but
with sparkles like hell I love it now
I'm gonna take max trace violet and a
power boosted and this is from the new
Mac cook and stuff and just groceries
collection I'm gonna make a make sure
between these two and that will make a
really nice
mid-tone bright as purple with the sheen
in it and I don't not play that I'm
gonna show you we're gonna play right
now
just first mix it exit people so I'm
gonna apply that to the inner corners of
my eyes blending into paper doll and
onto the outer corners of my eye
blending into the paper doll again and
that will give a really nice effect onto
the eyelid it will give it a lot of
dimension so now going into the crease
with this color and I'm just gonna take
a blending brush with the same colors
and blend it up into the crease just
blend that up
okay now I'm just kind of take my
beautiful iris and blend that above what
we have created so flower will lend it
into the mix and going up this will
really make it like a like a purple haze
like a like a purple cloud around your
eye I love this now I'm gonna take max a
light fall which is a really light
grayish pink and just with a big
blending brush I'm gonna blend that or
dust it over my brow bone just to blend
the purple down a bit remember the
beautiful thing with her sugar pill I
just reapplied that pigment unto the lid
for the bottom lid I'm gonna take jumbo
pencil in milk again and I'm just gonna
put a layer underneath my eye and I'm
gonna take five the trends and
power-boost it again and I'm just gonna
apply those to the outer corner of the
eye and then just blending it into the
crease to make one piece of eye now I'm
going to take paper doll the gorgeous
pigment from sugarpill again and I'm
just going to blend that onto the middle
of the entire lot and I'm going to take
beautiful iris only and I'm gonna pop
that on to the inner corners of the
lower lid okay now it's time for the
really fun bright neon blue eyeliner
it's actually a pigment from sugarpill
and you're gonna be shocked this is one
of the most gorgeous blue pigments ever
this is called royal sugar I what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna mix it with
Illamasqua stealing gel
I love this I don't know it just
makes me so happy from within it's just
and then apply it as an eyeliner it's
totally up to you how you want to apply
your eyeliner with this look I'm just
gonna go for a soft wing you don't have
to do everything exactly as I do it so
just do whatever you like okay but I'm
not going to do is apply a nude eyeliner
to my waterline this has been nine
neutralizer cream crayon then curl my
lashes with my Schumer eyelash curler
and apply some mascara and this is
makeup Studios waterproof 3d extra black
and it makes my lashes so beauty beauty
okay so now it's time to clean up my
face because I decided to do the eyes
first because with such bright colors
I'm always scared that it's gonna drop
on my cheeks and I'm not feeling the the
bright blue blush lately or anytime
really red really yellow I will try to
balance it out but I'm really hot right
now because of the lights on my face so
I'm gonna take my favorite foundation
this is max face and body in c1 and I'm
going to make it a little bit more
stronger with my matchmaster foundation
in one also by Mac and I'm just gonna
apply some concealer which is all mr.
rich liquid foundation
and with the lips also I don't want to
overpower this craziness on the eyes and
I'm just gonna take max fleshpot
lipstick and I'm gonna Pat that onto my
lips and then on the inner rim of my
lips I'm gonna take this cream blend
blush from Mac and this is called
Florida and this is insane and I'm just
gonna Pat that on like the inner rim of
my lips and it gives a really nice
gradient effect so that's what I'm gonna
do to my lips
say hey guys that completes this crazy
purple spring look again I wanted to go
