do my brows nowadays I've been getting
so many requests on how you do them or
how I do them so if you want to know how
I do my brows nowadays then please keep
on watching so the first thing I do for
my brows is always apply a primer or a
base to keep them on the entire day
basically because as you can see these
are my natural brows and don't ask me
why but from here to the like the end of
the eyebrow I have like three strands so
to make the eyebrows stay on all day
long I'm going to apply a primer now I'm
going to take a spoolie this is the one
by few sign Pro and I'm going to brush
my hairs the other direction upwards so
right now I can see the line of my
eyebrow and what I'm going to do is just
enhance that and fill any gaps in the
colors I always use for my brows are mix
Omega and charcoal Brown the brush I
always use is from stargazer and this is
the angled brow brush number seven so
I'm just going to take some of Amaya and
just a teeny tiny bit of charcoal Brown
and I'm just going to make a line under
my brow so just that like lower line the
look like the lower line I'm going to
enhance that
now you can see the top line of your
brows and what I'm going to do is just
follow that and just go out and make a
tail now what I was like is instead of
making a super arched brow so like when
you're at the arch point instead of
going down like really going down I
always go a little bit more to the side
to give it that nice elongated feeling
then I'm going to connect that bottom
part right here that's missing a tail
connected to that part right there
so now that I kind of outlined my brow
and made my own tail I'm going to fill
everything in and forget I'm just using
the same colors and I'm just going to
use the darkest color on the end of my
tail and just fill it all in what I did
on the bottom I'm going to do on the top
as well I'm going to like make some
brush strokes inwards so kind of give a
really nice faded beginning of a brow so
now all you have to do is fill it in
with Omega now personally I think this
is way too fake what I always like is to
make it look a little bit more natural
than this what I'm going to do is take
my spoolie again and I'm kind of on the
fade
the beginning of my brows by just going
just like yeah I don't know just kind of
wiggle it back and forth into that brow
now what you can do is just apply some
brow gel and be done with it now because
I am a really light light blonde I
always like to make the brows a little
bit lighter when I used to do in the
past was take max baer lash Pro long
lash mascara and it's a nude mascara
like that little tip if you're not a
blondie Mac has a lot of colors you can
choose from they have like a ginger
color they have a darker blonde color
they have a dark color but what I'm
actually doing since a week or so I'm
using a aqua color from Kryolan and
these are the aqua colors in this is I
don't know what this is this is some
yeah I don't know because the number
isn't there what I'm going to do is just
brush it through my hairs to make the
hairs blond again now the only last
thing that I always do and you don't
have to do is is trace my brow with
concealer underneath what I love that
this is that it really makes your
eyebrow sharp as hell it gives your brow
bone a highlight I love this I've been
doing this forever
if you don't like sharp brows then don't
do this concealer set you don't have to
do everything that I say and a concealer
using is for Mac and this is the NC 15
studio finish concealer
and then blend it into your skin now I
know that with concealer it's either you
love it or you hate it I love it if you
don't love it don't do it and that is
all I do from our past now I know that
normal people don't have to do this
because they actually have a brow tail I
don't I suck oh so you guys this is how
I do my brows um if you have any
questions leave them in the comment
section below and maybe uh
nikkietutorials calm for a full list of
all pugs that I use and I'm trying to
get to this name of the aqua color I
just it's it's not there so I don't know
but if you want to know which products I
use guys website needs toriel's calm
thank you guys so much for watching and
yeah so thank you guys so much for
watching hopefully I will see you guys
