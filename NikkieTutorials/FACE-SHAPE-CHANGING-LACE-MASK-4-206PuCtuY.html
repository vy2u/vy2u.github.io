something quite unusual for me on this
channel I'll be doing here we go
a first impression on a face mask and I
never really do first impressions on
face mask because I don't know why I
haven't done it to be honest also I feel
butt naked right now so I recently
bumped into the star skin lace masks and
it has a lifting lace compression
technology and it comes in a plumping
one and it's dope if you really want to
be Jason from Friday the 13th for
Halloween but glam there you go
so this is what they look like it's kind
of really creepy it's like Dan Grover
gone chic and then they also have the
revamping lace I mask Kamel to melt away
what is it but today we're going to be
focusing on the face masks and I'm
really excited for them usually I start
applying like a mask of foundation by
now but like no we're still here and
they're alright so I have decided to go
for the sculpting one because look at
how I need all the sculpting I can get
so when I look at the back of this it
says that it has coffee seed in it for
the sculpting it has Korean red pine for
the contouring golden chamomile for the
shaping and Tramel a-- mushroom mushroom
Tramel a-- mushroom for the smoothing it
is recommended to use a one to two times
a week and use Amelia Rose it is
suitable for all skin types the lifting
laced v-shaped compression lace mask is
the version emotion which woven with
breathable and stretchable cotton fibers
the lace mask fits tightly onto the face
and chin to visually sculpt and reshapes
dull and sagging skin me it is
simulating a natural facelift for a more
defined v-line we again indulge in the
soft glamorous feeling of being
enveloped in lace while the mask firms
defines and rejuvenates the skin this
sounds like heaven okay so not gonna lie
after reading the back I am really
excited to try this out do I really
think it's going to fit my face
oh okay let's go through the steps
together step one
cleanse your face and pat dry remove
mask and carefully unfold here we go Oh
question okay unfold oh she's pretty
a fearsome mask oh it is drenched in
that serum said to peel off the
protective layer and discard place mask
with the smoother side on face so here
he is here's Jason for Halloween looking
extra glam Oh cross Oh
step three is where we adjust the mask
over the eyes nose and mouth to fit okay
it is really what okay I know this
earpiece goes behind oh my god that is
really tight oh oh okay it's on oh my
god other ear that's really tight okay
so we got this and now this right here
is also going around the ear oh my god
this is really tight
okay ma'am my ears are too big for this
okay I guess that's on oh my god
literally flopping my ear in okay with a
guy through the oh oh please
so the mask is on I will say that like
my jawline is feeling very snatched when
Miss saying did my makeup for her
channel she did like the face tapes it
kind of feels like that
so first of all the mask is drenched in
the serum which I like the floor head
feels nice and fit it feels nice and
comfortable here two of my ears are
going through it I don't know
- Sara Lee feel a lot of sculpting and
pulling on my cheeks more so everything
is coming from the jawline area just
look at them they're like what can we do
to deserve it
especially this one just ones like mom
you betrayed me so now I have to keep
the mask on for 15 minutes and after
that I supposedly should have a lifted
face so let's wait and see so while I'm
here and talking very awkwardly I just
wanted to take this moment and thank you
for 7 million subscribers on my channel
it is so surreal and I never in my life
expected 7 million people to support me
and show their love for me and join me
on this makeup field journey so I had 7
million about a couple of days ago and
it's just so hard to grasp that so many
people out there have the same love for
makeup as I do and just from the bottom
of my heart I want to thank you for all
your support like it never goes
unnoticed and I feel like I'm in such a
great great place in my life right now I
am happy I am confident like life is
really good and it's all thanks to you
guys you guys give me such a confident
feeling and you make me feel comfortable
and you make me feel good about myself
I can't explain what that does to me so
I should probably stop talking about
because like I might ruin the baskets
thank you I love you and thank you
oh and if any director out there is
looking for a female Jason for a Friday
the 13th remake fimo Weis I'm here Janel
is here Janel Voorhees I'm here you know
are Michael Myers
Michelle Myers Burk Jill
how twisted is it that I really want to
eat chips want to wearing the sculpting
space left that is supposed to slim your
face
honestly when will I learn what if like
one day just because a trend unlike you
see all people wearing face lace mask on
the stage looking like weird serial
killers what oh oh okay
it's been 15 minutes all right it's in
15 minutes and my ears are ready to fall
off sleeve on for 30 minutes card gently
Pat remaining serum and skin do not
rinse okay I go number one oh oh oh oh
all right so there's still a lot of the
serum on my face so let's start working
this in
so here is my face after the mask and I
don't do we see lifting so my face
definitely feels super super hydrated
and nourished I feel nice and secure up
here but I don't know if this actually
did a whole lot I mean at the end of the
day I have a double chin and no mask is
going to remove a double chin but like I
don't know it might look a little bit
more tight just really hard to explain I
almost feel like everything's just a
little bit more you know a little bit
more tightened and a little bit were
pulled my skin definitely loved the
serum but what do you guys think let me
know in the comment section down below
if you see a fast difference in like
tightening do you see a difference in my
face shape
alright so that is what the surf
consulting v-shape commercial lace mask
has done for my face I don't know if it
did anything tightening wipes of my skin
definitely feels amazing all I know it
only retails for 10 euros here in
Holland which is a major major win when
you compare to the Givenchy face light
mask which is 330 dollars and I secretly
feel like they kind of stole the idea
from the Givenchy face mask the lace
face mask but hey if it works okay yeah
honestly I don't know what to tell you
my skin feels amazing I love the serum
you can always save the serum and use it
as a daily moisturizer until it runs out
but tight anyways I'll let you be the
judge of that so definitely sound off in
the comments down below I want to thank
