and oh god knows the month flew by as
usual I am super late with my head ton
of God knows this month is just I
promise that next month for my March
hits and God knows I'm going to be on
time I'm going to do it within the first
week of the new month a problem problem
problem anyways for today let's focus on
my February hips and Oh God knows I have
some really really cool products lined
up for you and I'm really excited let's
just stop the babbling and let's just
move on the first product I want to talk
about today is by Sephora now if you
follow me on Twitter and snapchat you
have to me talked about this quite often
but this right here is the Sephora rose
face mask off let me tell you a story
so basically sheet mask and I didn't
really have the best of friendships
basically whenever I would use a sheet
mask it didn't really do anything for my
skin I was just put that sheet on my
face for 20 minutes and 20 minutes of
nothing followed so chic masks were
irrelevant to me that were cancelled to
me couldn't relate to anyone talking
about them until I found the rose face
mask by Sephora I'm pretty sure I was
talking about my dry skin on Twitter
again as I always do and people
recommended this to me and I didn't
trust what they said because I was like
it's a sheet mask but then I went to
Sephora I bought one tried it out and I
fell in absolute love I tried it out for
the first time on snapchat and told you
what I thought of it and since then I
haven't been able to put this down
literally what I do before I feel any
tutorial before I feel just a tutorial a
video just before I saw the video this
is on my face to give me that moisture
and to give me that glow and to give me
that everything in this and it really
cools and calms down the face plus gives
you such a boost of boost of moisture if
you have dry skin and you get hot a lot
I when I get hot my faces
bread so this close me down it gives me
that moisture it is affordable it is I'm
going to go as far to sing it is one of
the best sheet masks I've ever tried in
my life I have no I have one bad thing
to say about it when you take the mask
off and you rub the serum into your skin
it smells like roses but it has like a
weird odor to it I can't quite put my
finger on it but it has a smell it's not
the most pleasant smell that's the only
thing I'm going to say but once you you
know massage it into the skin it will be
gone in like a minute but it does have
that scent for a minute so I just want
you to know that also this art here this
is really annoying goodbye to your no
god no
next up I've been obsessing over this
foundation right here this is called
Lancome Pat idole ultra 24 hour makeup
and I am in the color 100 ivory neutral
I pretty much never really dive into
like the high high-end foundation
because they're always too dark or warm
on me because I'm the color paper that
leaves so I never really venture into
like the high high-end foundations I
have a few that are like pretty
expensive and they they rock my world
but like Lancome should now all those
types of brands are always too warm and
dark on me into the light brown boo I
was shopping at Sephora and I saw this
Lancome foundation and it's that 24 hour
now you can imagine that my mind went
like I'm wicked I did those I love
anything long-lasting and like full
coverage so I did a swatch and I saw
that it was full coverage but it didn't
dry down into like this cakey like
pancake layer it dried down beautifully
but it still looked like skin so I went
ahead and bought it and basically this
is my go-to foundation for when I want
my face to last all day I wore this to
den duty I wore this to the longest days
of my life and my foundation still
looked on so do people still say that my
face looked on point for the entire
every time I use this it's just such an
amazing beautiful foundation it is full
coverage but you can definitely use
little amounts to make it more to a
medium coverage but as we don't like to
take it on it's really good I believe it
comes in two stick from as well which I
really want to try out because I love to
take foundations but um yeah I highly
recommend this and give it a try another
face product I'm obsessing over and this
oh my god is took them forever benefit
launched a hoola bronzer in life now
make a deep but everyone can get hoola
every time I watch and make a pictorial
by a different guru that is darker than
me they're always like so let me now go
ahead and grab my hoola bronzer and dust
it all over my face that looks snatch I
can relate because I am so like who
looked like mud on me it looked like
warmed up toasty mud it wasn't a good
look I tried it trust me I tried it I
quickly you know gave up on hoola
bronzer and then benefit lunch light and
I've like it is lighter than I thought
they would have made it and I'm wearing
it as bronzer on my face today and I
must say I love it it just in my skin it
beautifully gradually warms me up but it
never goes too far like it gives me that
sunkissed like big I see you but it
doesn't go too far and I really like
that it's a very fail-proof bronzer
because a lot of volunteers can go a
little far but I feel like what this
it's hard to mess it up because it's
such a beautiful face Ferranti color I
highly recommend this it smell it smells
oh my god it smells like a sunny day on
the beach looking at that good over
there a blush that has been really doing
it for me the last month is my covergirl
this is called the true bland blush in
the color
in the color 100 light Rose I pretty
much bought this on a hunch like I
looked at it and I thought it was pretty
so I bought it I did not know that once
I bought this that I would be wearing
this pretty much every day this comes in
like a rounded top shape look at the
dents I made in that one I pretty much
whenever I wear blush I pretty much wear
this one because it has that it's soft
it has cut you can barely see them a
finger it is soft it is pinky peachy
rosy it has a nice one with aa study to
it
and pretty much when you wear this you
look glowing from within now and then
when you stack on that highlighter on
top it's like BAM but like it's a
beautiful blush that just perks up the
skin perks up the face it adds that
warmth to the things that it needs but
it doesn't go overboard I'm ready to
blush today is the barely-there blush
but it's there and it's pretty and
beautiful I love the formula I love the
texture it's long lasting and I'm really
really impressed by the flesh and it's
drugstore so it's affordable I highly
recommend it plus they come in a bunch
more colors that believe for which is
not one ok I'm going to keep the short s
Jaffe I don't remember if I've talked
about this in my hips before this here
is life and more this right here is the
make up for ever starlet powder in
number 13 I talked about this everywhere
I'm snapchat on Instagram here on my
channel so I'm going to keep it short
and sassy if you want to glow like
nobody's business if you want to blind
every is just I know it's getting old
too blind everyone but it's addictive
I'm wearing it as my highlight today
start with powder number 13 my makeup
forever is the glow of all glows almost
shouldn't say anything else right now it
is a globe Azzam in a pot I love it so
much I'm so worried about clothes
usually I have like an eye shadow
powered or like an eye shadow to talk
about but like a doubt a doubt so next
up I have this liner right here just
advise you a it is called the kitten
now okay I use like five different
liners for my wings it's just a
mandatory like that and extra I use a
tongue for pen for my outline I use a
Mac liquid last liner and black to fill
it all in because that is the most
waterproof liquid liner I've ever abused
in my life look I have those days where
even my Tom fort liner starts bleeding
on the inner corners and it's it's a
mess I'm always looking for you know
that eyeliner that stays on on that
inner lash line to blend in my lashes
and to make it all look a little bit
more handsome look at my case there's
nothing natural here we know how you
have when you wear lashes and you have
that little gap of flesh on the inner
corners because your lashes don't go all
the way to the inner corner I always
apply a liner there to make it all very
you know flew in and just go and slow
but a lot of liners don't want to stay
there they travel they bleed it's just
not a good look until I found kitten
liner kit liner has only bled on my
inner corners once and it was because I
have super super was crying and I want
to tell you why I was crying but you're
gonna laugh at me I was rewatching
Pokemon Pikachu most times it was really
emotional
okay so just liner only bled on me that
one time where a really teary eyes
because it was getting a little
emotional but like all other times and
pretty much uses every time I wear
makeup because I always want to make my
lashes blend in this always stays and it
doesn't go anywhere so it's a little bit
extra and you know it's really extra to
have one liner just for the inner
corners but this is the only one so far
that is only bled on me once real quick
I want to throw out there that I felt an
allergic reaction to my previous
favorite lash glue which was the Eschete
Oh lash glue the companion bond oh my
god that glue was made of dreams
it just it was a card core like kept
your lashes on like you could stand in
the rain you could send in a windstorm
like nothing would happen to your lashes
they would stay on all day
that feels an allergic reaction to it
but couldn't use it anymore every time
use it my lashline would get really
thick and like Roland and I have to stop
using it so I was looking for a new lash
glue that was just as strong and amazing
but like wouldn't give me that allergic
reaction and I quickly found my answer
in the Thrive cosmetics Infiniti
waterproof lash adhesive J kids I was
actually the one who recommended this to
me on Twitter so thank you Jay kissa and
yeah I've been really really impressed
with this is all vegan it's amazing it
keeps your lashes on it takes about a
minute or two for it to become like
really tacky to go if you're really
liking this so just wanted to let you
know all right next up is my all-time
favorite nude glossy go to combinations
that have been going for for the last
couple of weeks and a lot of people on
snapchat and like Instagram asked me for
this combo so here at I don't know if
this is like the new lip off their skin
tones that fit every eye look you can go
like bad and blended on the eyes and pop
this on and you look super you know sexy
you can do a light eye and pop this on
in your like very fresh and nude it's my
go-to nude glossy lip combo that just
always seems to work so the lipstick I
cut off first is by Mac this is called
flash pot now it looks more rosy and
dark in the pan than it is let me go
three intense titles I'm wearing it
today see how it makes it super super
nude which I love but then we got to add
a little gloss to it to make us look a
little bit more alive like there so the
gloss isn't loving for this you know
that this is like my my weakness Vichy
way lip toppers I'm always talking about
skinny-dipped and when they came up with
frostbite I was obsessed but skinny dip
was always my winner until I found this
combination when I put skinny dips over
top a flash pot lipstick by Mac it
becomes a little bit too golden a little
to warm whereas if I go for frostbite
which is a like it's snowy pearl with
like all these colors of glitter in it
it it keeps it nude and cool toned now
my little trick with frost and I'm
almost out of it oh you can see I'm
pretty much down there with Frost night
lips Hopper my trick with this is I
don't put it all over the lips I feel
like when I put the gloss all over my
lips they end up on my teeth I get like
really nasty lines everywhere it's just
not a good look but my trick is I put
the frostbite and I'm almost out I put
the frostbite on the slower edge of the
lip too right here mm-hmm
so I don't go up to like the center of
my mouth and it takes some more and hit
the Cupid's bow but then what I do is go
slightly over the edge of my lip and
that's going to give you like a
beautiful sumptuous like luscious like
full look and then lastly just a little
bit above the center of the lip and this
just makes your new lips look full plump
but the cloth doesn't go everywhere so
basically the gloss is just centering
like outlining the lips sort of it's
like using the gloss as a lip pencil
almost and I'm in love all right Sally
looking around I think that is it for my
hits of the month of February I do have
a no god no so let's just go right to it
oh yeah
No so my oh god no this month was
actually inspired by my Mac soft ochre
Paint Pot and I love that if we have
like this ongoing joke about this
whenever I mentioned this in a tutorial
I try not to mention it because everyone
pretty much knows that this is the only
thing that works for me and I love that
we have this ongoing joke about me
always using it but you know it kind of
really got to me because I was like okay
I got to change it up I got a try new
products to prime with so pretty much I
bought like slides new eye primers I'm
still in the midst I'm so the midst of
trying them and I had my third primer
and it was a disaster and I was so sad
went out for dinner and I like to make
myself look really pretty and I used
this right here as my eye primer and by
the end of the night I looked like a
creased molten mess it even got to the
point where Rick asked me hey what's
wrong with your eyeshadow you know when
men see things with your eyeshadow you
know it's wrong you know it's bad you
know you got to skip it and cancel it I
have the essence two-in-one I shed oh
and primer long-lasting brightening and
flawless finish so this is it right here
I was like I love the color it's a
little lighter than my skin tone so it's
going to make anything that I put over
top really pop and brightness and even
swatching it looked nice it blended out
nicely sort of but the problem with the
stuff is that it isn't long laughing at
all in fact I feel like this make my eye
shadow creeps way faster than if I
wouldn't help you sir primer it's just
oh I was like I'm really hoping that I'm
finding like a drugstore gym where
essence can be our hero and become a
replacement for soft ochre it is not it
it did not it kicked me in the back when
I wasn't looking it's bad and that is it
