darker tutorial no there's not going to
be anything sexy because I'm this is
everything far from sexy I don't think I
could ever be sexy but this is a
tutorial all focusing on the color gray
and of course it's kind of link us to 50
shades of grey or fifty shades darker
which is going to hit theaters does it
in theatres it's going to hit it soon I
got this new Maybelline lipstick in and
it was the color of grey and I've never
worn grey list Nick not that I can
remember and it just inspired me to do
something great so you can wear this
crazy ass almost drag look to when you
go see fifty shades darker or when you
wanna look great so without any further
ado if you would like to know how to get
this look right here to seduce yo
Christian gray then hit this keep on
watching all right let's get grey and
dirty alright the first thing I'm going
to go in with is by elf this is the prep
and hydrate balm ever since I used it in
that video I fallen in love with this
when you have dry skin this really puts
on that moisture and it gives you that
smoothness and just it's perfect for is
going of dry skin as a prep for
foundation it doesn't necessarily keep
my makeup on longer or do anything for
pores or anything like that it's just
really giving you that kick of like
luxurious moisture alright popping some
milk cooling stick underneath my eyes
there's also to prepped my under eyes
for all the concealer and baking when
you have dry skin and you're afraid of
baking make sure you really prep that
under-eye with a lot of moisture so that
you don't look cakey and as a finishing
touch for my eyes I'm going to go in
with pure identity I know you're like
wow that's a lot of stuff for the eyes
I've been doing this little regimen here
for my under eyes and like saved and
looking balm with makeup on so I love
what it does um keep doing it whose core
foundation today I'm going to try a
brand spanking new one for me this is by
NYX
our coffee total control drop
foundations now they're super super
liquidy I think they came out with like
a range of 24 color so clap clap mix
very well done and I've adhere have the
colors 5 lights and the color Oh -
alabaster and then what the foundation
NYX recommends buying this brush and
this is the number twenty two brush and
it is meant for this foundation now I
personally hate doing my foundation with
rushes ever since the beauty blender
came onto my might might say brushes
make me feel streaky and uneven and just
if the Beauty Blender gets it in so
perfectly but since this brush is meant
for this I'm going to do it now the cool
thing about this foundation is is that
you control the coverage two drops is
light coverage three drops is medium and
four drops is full so I'm going to go
for a drops because I like full full
force one two three four how is that
ever going to be full coverage hmm I got
this formula it's so thin I'm already
noticing that it's drying for dry skin
like really mad
like so what I can say is I used way
more than four drops because I mix two
colors and already I'm out of foundation
and I barely have my entire face covered
it is super thin super matte and I'm not
sure if I hate that things like this
might be one of the most matte
foundations I've ever used in my life oh
boy it is really graduating my dry park
it's like hey dry parts if I don't just
feel the show today times I really don't
like this foundation it's making my skin
look super dehydrated it is I really
don't like this I want to take it I'm
going to take it off okay and we're back
so I'm going to go back to just make
sure right here I really liked what does
did for my skin in my previous videos so
I'm going to go in with the Loreal Pro
glow in 201 and the total cover
infallible in 301 oh Beauty Blender I'm
so sorry for leaving you like this I
will never do it again love this
foundation combination is like the
perfect mix of coverage glow amazingness
it's just it doesn't feel cakey and
heavy on the skin I love this stuff
for concealer I go into the morphe one
called sand this is I believe a recently
launched color because I never was able
to try them more if you can see all of
that before because they were too dark
and and is it's not as light as I want
it to be but it's like light enough so I
still need some shape tape to like do
the thing
now let's bake to make sure our under
eyes don't go anywhere just like every
look I'm going to prime using my Mac
soft ochre Paint Pot and since gray is
such a difficult color to blend I'm
first going to set my crease to brow
bone area with a matte skin tone color
to help lending later on for the crease
in the middle in with this Kat Von D
shade + light eye contour quad and
taking this color asphere called base
and basically going to blow at this
color from the arbor crease all the way
to the inner crease and make sure it is
perfectly blended now with the Mac Pro
Longwear concealer I'm going to cut the
lid which will eventually also cut the
crease and really take your time and
look back on the other eye to make sure
they're even
now I'm going to end with this awesome
new product by Sela called magnificent
metal liquid shadow this is in the color
smokey storm and this is going to go all
over the cutlet this stuff is everything
back into that Kat Von D quad and taking
the center gray color
and with a small liner brush I'm really
going to define the line of that cup
crease for my winged liner today I'm
going to use a liquid lipstick this is
my color train called hard of stone for
the lower lash line I'm going to use
that crease color with a little bit of
black and smoke it out on the outer
corner working your way towards the
inner corner
and highlighting the inner corners using
white eyeshadow for lashes today I'm
going to use Lily lashes and the style
lush I know uses way too often but they
just complement every lip out there and
they're my favorite alright I've ever
done time to focus on these 50 shades of
darker cheeks I'm gonna go in with Mac's
blush in taupe to contour and especially
with like super gray eyes and we're
going to have gray lips after want to
show your cheeks a little bit 11 because
if you do not warm up your cheeks you're
going to look dull you're going to look
flat and honey that is not what we want
so let's bronze and contour and blush
and glow it up for blush I'm going to go
in with this makeup for everyone in
number 10 for my glow today I want to
really like radiate light Hill Mars you
know I just really want to go all out
for this one like I wanna so as a base
I'm first going to go in with the
Maybelline master strobing liquid and
color 100 so I'm going to use this as a
base and then go right over top using
Juiz citrine
life is good and beautiful I love what
the Maybelline and the citrine measure a
do together it's like is like a glow on
a new dimension it's like oh now with my
favorite Milani setting Fran gonna set
this all into place to get rid of any
cakiness any too much miss just make it
off and for lips of course we're going
to use another shade of grey and I have
three choices I have the liner choice
the coloured raine heart of stone I have
this Maybelline one called the vivid
matte liquid lipstick in number 65 and
this is called a sinful stone or I have
this one by Smashbox this is in the
color chill zone and it has a little bit
more Brown infused to it so we can go
for like a true true grey lighter or
darker or we can go for a more brownish
gray and if you like this Smashbox warm
totally ties in with the crease colors
so I'm going to go for Smashbox and
maybe put the color ring on the center
and that guides me close this fifty
