another review a review remember I was
filmed in forever so this is going to be
a long one so today I'm going to review
another sponge after doing the Kabuki
tulip sponge that was working in forever
I recently found out about the makeup
bullet and this is it looks like a
finger blender instead of a Beauty
Blender we're now facing the finger
blender and I know this has been out for
a while and I know that's hot tea did
the video on it and I I didn't watch
that video because actually I didn't
watch any videos reviewing this because
I wanted to go in blank I wanted to go
in without any judgement because in my
mind this could be like a far far cousin
from the tulip kabuki sponge and then I
know I want that again so I purposely
ignored reviews on this I know this has
been out for a while I'm definitely not
the first to review this but I just
really wanted to get my two cents on
this I really wanted to try this for
myself so mm-hmm
alright so let's read what the packaging
has to tell us the make a bullet a hide
s cosmetics finger sponge apply flawless
makeup stat it is hypoallergenic it is
latex free it is washable and reusable
warning your other makeup tools will be
jealous when you transform your finger
into the perfect cosmetics applicator
blender and smudger to speed up your
makeup routine with the most
user-friendly cosmetic sponge on the
market we'll see about that it fits
snugly on the finger for absolute
control it flawlessly blends on every
part of the face it's free of hands to
hold other stuff as well and it's soft
and gentle on the skin create a vine
anyway
created by an Emmy award-winning
celebrity makeup artist well who look
can we get cliffhanger alright so I
bought this little package that has
three of them so I'm just gonna I'm just
going to put this to the test let's see
if this works
alright so it just made one damn
this is what the difference is like when
one is dance and one is dry just like a
Beautyblender or any other makeup sponge
when you make them wet and you rinse out
the excessive amounts of water you are
left with a bigger sister so this is how
big it's gonna get for you you know we
got no deceiving pictures here this is
what you're going to get so I am oh my
god oh my god
I have done my brows and the top of my
eyes to get myself looking a little bit
better so before I go in with the finger
blender and going to prep my skin a
little bit because Mom I'm dry so I'm
going to use is the urban decay b6
vitamin infused prep priming spray it's
just okay got some elf prep and hydrate
bomb the stuff if you have severely dry
skin like I do so this does is having
spent time and beautiful okay the time
is coming for me to slip to remember to
wrap it up kids
okay first first impressions I
definitely expected it to be a little
bit more snug I expected it to like hug
my finger a little bit more it's kind of
like I can I can take this off without
any effort so I'm hoping that it stays
now going to go into my foundation today
I'm going to use one of my all-time
favorites the alum comb tense is all
Ultron super French up in here ultra
24-hour makeup foundation I am in the
I'm in the color 100 ivory neutral and
this is beautiful it's beautiful and
basically what I'm going to do is pick
up the foundation with the finger
blender and just hope and pray it's a
success like for ones can ever view with
successful products in my life gift tip
yummy okay we're all tapping Dena's
foundation wrong and too must be in I'm
already noticing that I have to kind of
keep the sponge down using my thumb and
my middle finger cous else is going to
go places that you don't want to go
I mean so far looking beautiful where it
looked at right up underneath so that I
do that messing up anything oh my gosh
is this finally going to be a successful
thing oh okay I'm going to pick up some
more for my other side and just gonna
start tapping the texture of the sponge
is what kind of compare it to it's
definitely not a condom it's definitely
not a balloon it's definitely not a bell
pepper definitely not a tampon I didn't
seem too crazy obsessed lately the
texture is reminding me of a more flimsy
less expensive version of the beauty
blender
you know how the morphe sponges are
ultra smooth the Sigma sponge has a
little bit more texture to it and like
the Beauty Blender is like right in
between it all
I feel like texture wise is damn near
like the Beauty Blender but you feel
that it's a little bit more cheap you
know what I mean and it's not to like
hate on the product you can feel that
the texture and like the quality of the
sponge itself is a little bit more cheap
and flexible now I will say this is
blending in my foundation gorgeously the
only problem I'm running into right now
I have fake nails and when I try to use
the tip when I put pressure on the tip
right here my fake nail kind of pushes
through and I feel like a little soft
sharpness in the distance and it's like
doing things to me and now this is where
for me it gets tricky anyways when I
have done my eye makeup before
foundation how people do what I will
never understand but how they reach the
forehead without messing up their
perfectly done brows magic I'm going to
try
now I think one of the questions you
guys will have is if it eats up
foundation like if you if it's like if
it eats a foundation more than a regular
Beautyblender wood or whatever it's tiny
little bit like it is soaking up the
product a tiny bit more but nothing
where I'm like oh my god I need a refund
because you ate all my foundation money
doing liking this actually so the sponge
has dried a little bit with all these
foundations so I'm going to reactivate
it a little bit with Evie and pray and
now it's time for a concealer and I'm
not even going to talk about which one I
use anymore because every rule is human
anyway
you know it's when you I'm going a
little hand and the concealer today I'm
thinking about this other technique
where as opposed to sliding it onto your
finger why not use it as an actual
sponge indices that work one of the
things that's saying is that it speeds
up your makeup routine with the most
user-friendly because medics ones on the
market
I wouldn't say I'm necessarily really
much faster than with a Beauty Blender
because take me a little bit to get that
perfect smooth blend into the skins or
saying up the fastest sponge out there
I don't agree now am I having fun with
this absolutely I would like to take
this moment to apologize for all of you
that click this video hoping that I
would feel badly trust me I'm kind of
with you I expected this video to take a
whole different route so baby I like
this tour bus I like what we go where
Italy me when I bought the sponge this
is never going to work out you're going
to look like a fool it's going to read
the tulip kabuki sponge all over again
okay now we're going to bake so I'm
going to remove all the creases
underneath and go right in let me
actually use
another finger blender for that as a
puppet this one laughs holy crap it gets
it on and there we have it i i'm sure
i'm shook to my crusty ass feet my mind
is blown right now like I expected this
to go horribly wrong like trust me when
I say I thought this was going to be a
nightmare
alright so I'm going to go off-camera
and finish off my face and then it will
be back to tell you my final verdict Oh
sick
Oh as they do and that guy's is what my
face looks like after I've done my
powder under eyes contour blush I must
say I did not expect this any of this to
happen in today's video I really thought
it was going to be one of those comical
ones where everyone laughed at me and I
felt great about myself but I actually
think this is really fun and I like
really see that the product works now
going back to the claims that made it
definitely is not faster than a Beauty
Blender it flawlessly blends I totally
agree with that because I feel like my
face looks really good right now overall
I think the product works and I think
the part I liked it most for is baking
under the eyes it just it just passed on
that powder so effortlessly and so
beautifully without it looking cakey or
too much and it was like a mess even
covered I loved it for powder I love
your bread so yeah that concludes this
review on the makeup bullet finger
sponge the finger Blender let me know in

expected from this video and if you
