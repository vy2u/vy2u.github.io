another day and another weird foundation
applicator on the market and of course
that's another day of me trying it out
for you
here on my channel today we're going to
be talking about this right here this
right here this is a fingerprint makeup
sponge by Smashbox now the official
title is the photo filter gel cushion
applicator so basically what this is is
like the scylla sponge is like a
silicone gel applicator but instead of
it being smooth like the sealant
this actually has a fingerprint on it so
basically this is a huge humongous
finger I mean we all know what the
experts always say it's like tap it in
with your finger tap it in with your
finger your fingers the best tool and I
think Smashbox was like you know what if
everyone keeps saying that the finger is
the best tool let's create a fingertip
so today on my channel I'm gonna be
trying it out I'm gonna be applying my
foundation and concealer with it to
really put it to the test and see what
it looks like is it gonna be flawless is
there gonna be a disaster like the
scylla sponge is gonna rock my world
only time can tell
let's start alright so welcome to the
sad reality that is my face
so it just went to the smashbox website
to see what they say about the sponge a
little more and the description goes
this gel cushion applicator applies and
blends face primers and liquid
complexion products it's easy to clean
plus it won't waste any of the products
you're obsessed with so just like the
oscilloscope a product like a regular
Beauty Blender so regular Beauty sponges
you wet them so they give a more natural
feel but they always grab a little bit
of the product they soak it up a little
bit to give you a more flawless even
feel with this because it's a gel
because it's silicone it won't go
anywhere because it cannot absorb so in
the long run you have to use less
product which saves you more products
which costs you less money ask for tips
it says just got a new gel mani or we're
a creek or we're acrylics actually yes I
just got mine done yesterday
this gel cushion
hater keeps it on your face and not
under your nails okay benefits it pairs
perfectly with primer and or liquid
complexion products it applies and
blends product evenly we'll say well
that grooves mimic the finger tips for
the smoothest no mess application the
flexible diamond shape reaches every
angle of the face I'm hygienic and easy
to clean and it is cruelty free so I'm
just gonna let this let's try this I'm
actually really really excited to try
this out I am anxious but I I have trust
I have trust in this my main issue with
the sila sponge always was that it was
too smooth and I feel like now that it's
got like a finger tip it's actually
gonna be good to me alright so as it
stated on line this can also be used to
apply primers with so that's the first
thing I'm gonna be doing with it today
I'm gonna go in with my hourglass
mineral veil this has been growing on me
I used to hate this and don't actually
just randomly put it in my makeup
routine and I was like wow my skin looks
more smooth and it just lasted a little
bit longer so I'm really liking this to
smooth out everything and to give it
some more longevity okay so here we go
I'm gonna use less than I think I need
because it doesn't absorb it so holding
it at the tip of my finger like an
actual finger tip so um first I'm gonna
distribute it first gonna distribute
first I'm gonna massage it in and then
once I feel like most of it is worked in
I'm actually gonna Pat it in so far it's
feeling very nice and soft on the skin
I do feel the grooves of the fingerprint
a tiny bit on my skin but it's not like
a weird feeling it's it's an actual like
it feels good
so when blending it in like this I
definitely feel the grooves I definitely
feel like the little ridges I mean of
course you feel it more than your actual
fingertips but so far it's got a little
bit more
rip and an actual like Silla sponge and
I'd like that way better so now I'm
gonna start tapping everything in now
I'm gonna be totally real with you guys
when thinking about doing this video so
real I was like that's gonna be a short
filming day cuz it's probably gonna go
to my face is gonna look like wack
but let's see how it goes maybe it's
gonna look amazing and I have a perfect
beat for today the primer is applied and
it feels very nice and smooth it doesn't
feel like anything is piling up on my
skin it actually feels really nice and
blended in almost better than what I do
with my hands so let's see how it goes
with foundation for a foundation today I
want to go for something that I know is
really really hard to mess up my Lancome
tidal ultra we're in number 100 ivory
neutral this foundation is my Holy Grail
and it's really really hard to mess this
one up so if the fingerprints sponge
gets it all wrong it's not the
foundation it's the sponge here we go
tiny dollop of the foundation so let's
see how it goes first I'm gonna spread
it out I'm gonna rub it in oh wait what
you can actually see oh my god you can
actually see the little ridges and
grooves of the fingerprint and the
foundation no okay so we're just gonna
start tapping it in
like god no what is this okay it's
spread out evenly and now I'm gonna tap
it in with that actually looks good wait
what no way no way no way no way no way
no way I'm not believing this my eyes
are deceiving me it cannot be true that
one of these fun just finally works so
what it did was spreaded on kind of work
it in and then start tapping it in like
you would do with a sponge and so far it
is blending it in really seamlessly I
will say that occasionally it leaves a
very obvious fingerprint mark on your
face and it kind of looks weird to have
like little grooves of a huge
fingerprint you know it's kind of like
King Kong like press his thumb on your
face and be like Babbage I do think I'm
losing a little bit of coverage with my
regular makeup sponges I have more cover
to them with this but so far I compared
to the actual Scylla sponge this is
amazing so working it in using circular
motions just kind of getting it
everywhere and that's when it looks
streaky and like a mess and cakey and
just like you don't want to go out like
that but then once you start patting it
in like actually tapping it in up and
down up and down up and down it starts
taking place on your face in a really
nice way oh my god I feel like someone's
spreading Nutella on my face and I'm
like sliced bread okay so on the nose
it's not a fun process at all
it's streaky I can get it in every
corner it's mmm oh my god we started off
so well don't give up on me now
oh wow okay so on the forehead it's
finger prints only it's like King Kong
never left when he did that thump motion
so it's starting to look like finger
print galore on my face right now which
is not a look I saw on the trend page
for late summer early fall looks and
then this is the portion that I hate
the nose it is not working but I'm
working it in here it's kind of
disrupting it on the lower portion of my
I also am noticing that with this it is
so mad this Bunge just transformed this
foundation in something really matte and
almost drying and it never looks like
that with normal sponges so I'm looking
like I dried a butthole honestly I
wonder why companies to keep trying with
these sponges because I don't think
anyone truly highly enjoys doing their
foundation with like the silicone
sponges or the gel sponge if you like
brands have to give up it's almost a
little stop trying to make it happen
because it will never happen derma Kol I
highly enjoyed this as foundation in my
previous video that went up yesterday
which thank you so much for all the
support and the fun comments but I'm
going to use it as concealer
and then start typing it it's just not
looking like it has to look like it
looks like it's lying on top of the skin
it doesn't want to blend improperly and
as soon as it starts to look okay and
DISA and like it's well blended in and
you want to go back in and perfect it a
little bit more it starts like picking
up the product and making it look patchy
and like a mess oh I'm not enjoying this
at all it looks like Apache war zone
okay just for shits and giggles I'm
gonna bring you in so close so you can
see do you see that when you work on
your nose right here here it leaves
marks do you see I want you to see the
fingerprints especially here it is
making my pores to look humongous it is
making my undereyes looks so cakey like
you see it's sitting on top of your skin
keep the nose keep the nose look at that
nose do you see those pores I never have
that problem my nose never looks like
that I'm sorry this is so real and up
close but I want you to see what I'm
talking about this is not a good look
and all right so the Smashbox photo
could wet photo filter what is this call
does it look fine from a distance
absolutely but when you get up close and
personal it's a bat look and you don't
want to look like it started off so well
and for the first time I was like the
scylla sponge was too smooth like with
these finger print grooves I actually
feel a little bit of texture and a
little bit of grittiness which is gonna
make it more pleasant but overall I feel
like with every gel or silicone sponge
we're gonna face the same problems one
it's gonna look like it's a mask lying
on top of your skin for me it pretty
much always accentuates my pores so if
you're not looking to make your pores
look bigger and I mean I get it every
makeup company ever since the Beauty
Blender is looking for the next best
thing in foundation application and I
hate to
but I don't know if we'll ever get there
I feel like nothing can make it look as
traceless and flawless as a regular
beauty blender or Beauty sponge if we
look at it from the positive side if you
have super oily skin and I think I said
this in my salons review as well this
will transform your foundation in
something more matte but I don't see
this looking really flawless around the
nose area so maybe just focus on the
cheeks on the forehead on the chin and
really get that longevity and madness on
it there but that's about the only plus
I have for it it's just so sad because
it started off so well but the more I
wanted to perfected the more it started
to like mess up break apart and become
patchy
I'm sorry Smashbox I'm sorry everyone
who's a firm believer in sponges like
this but I am NOT you know products that
I love may not work out for you and
products that you're obsessed with may
not do it for me other than that that's
it guys that is my first impressions /
review on the new Smashbox it's not even
that new but like the new Smashbox
fingerprint sponge it retails for $20 if
