okay you know no today we're talking
about my transition and Nikki's helping
me pick what kind of a giant I want
like a mother Alek down hey guys so
a couple of days ago I ordered some new
on the South several hills eyeshadows
off of Sephora and they came in
yesterday and they truly inspired me to
come up with this makeup look right here
it's a very warm toned sexy smoky eye
with a glitter pink and silver glitter
and then I wanted to do something
different for the lips so not go with
like a typical nude or like a dark or
like a red so I went for like a cool
toned pinky nude which totally contrasts
with the eyes and I am totally living
for it I went for my cool girl hair so
yeah if you would like to know how to
get this makeup look right here then
keep on watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
