gathered here for the funeral of
nikkietutorials ha ha hey guys today I
am here to do the full face using only
glitter makeup challenge this is one of
the most mixed emotions I've ever felt
in my life because one part of me is
like oh my glitter god this is what your
life has come to this is your destiny
this is why your dad and your mom found
each other and this is your purpose the
other side of me however is telling me
to run as fast as I can right now and
never look back
just a motion taking me yo fag I've sat
in my studio for about 20 minutes now
contemplating my life you know what it
is the last day of winter wonder week
2016 it has been so amazing and why not
go out with a bang why not you the most
New Year's Eve look of all New Year's
Eve looks by actually throwing glitter
on my face making me look like fireworks
ladies and gentlemen winter wonder week
has come to this finale it is time for
me to do my full face using only glitter
and if you don't hear from me ever again
it's because the glitter herpes demon
killed me
so for eyes I wanted you this blown out
sort of purpley eye with a purple wing
and to make it all stick a little better
and going in with the Mac mixing medium
eyeliner so the glitter I'll be using on
my lids is this one by Lena lashes she
came up with glitters this is the dazzle
days glitter in the color NOLA and it's
like a a lavender holographic Christine
where you at first I'm putting down a
little bit of that base and I want this
to be blown up there's not really going
to be a crease here it's going to be
that lavender holographic color and then
a boss asked liner there's no going back
now
you guys seeing this glitter all over my
eyes
suddenly I don't hate it anymore are you
experiencing this holographic glitter on
my lids right now you guys I'm loving
this challenge already I thought I was
gonna go the easy way out but no now
that it is on I am living for this so
I'm gonna go in with a darker purple
also with holographic particles so Jonah
ooh it is a little bit oh come through
gradient um I've come to the conclusion
that blending glitter as hard as them
alright now who doesn't love a blinding
inner corner I'm gonna go in with spark
vile it is lit up in here I am here to
blind oh my god that is gorgeous are we
seeing that spark on the inner clip as
I'm doing this I have like two voices in
my head one is saying oh my god keep on
going and the other one is like really
silently saying you're never gonna get
this off your face I love the purple but
I kind of want to incorporate a little
bit of copper into it so I have this
glitter right here alright I am loving
this for brows I'm gonna start off with
this grimace polly glitter in 75 why is
that so light okay going in with a
darker glitter there we go see now we
can actually draw a brow on so I'm
pretty okay with this brow is just too
stark at the beginning so I'm gonna do a
little bit of an ombre
all right now that we have our top eyes
done brows done I think it's only
fitting to now start focusing on the
skin oh my god but before I do that I'm
gonna go in with a sticky primer this is
strobe cream by Mac I need something
that is going to make the glitter stick
but not never come off again for the
face i'm going in with vanilla ice
number four glitter by lit do you have
any pigmentation i'm gonna go into
modern love by lit but i have a little
bit of problem i couldn't find any
glitter that matches my skin tone
whatsoever so um i'm gonna be too dark
and i'm going to put down a little bit
of concealer by little i mean a lot to
make this stick I'm literally starting
to look like Edward Cullen chillin on
the beach for too long
alright so I've been tapping the
sunburned color on my face for like 20
minutes now I think it's time to move on
for the lower lash line I'm gonna go
into that copper tini color this sunburn
skin I can't
some silver on the inner corners
feel like we had such an amazing start
and now it's just tonight mare that I
can never wake up from on to
highlighting I'm going to grab more of
that mixing medium another artiste brush
and I'm going to go in with that spark
color and some silver and that is
probably going to be too cool tone but
you know what
I'm a mess I confess and there's no
going back
Hey
Wow and we're great it looks stunning
when it hits the light but baby
maybe this will save me this is making
me as gray as the Tin Man but baby when
it hits on the hall you know those
makeup looks that only look good from a
certain angle today's that day from this
angle it is slay a city but from this
angle thick alright let's wrap this one
up let's do some lips and lashes and
okay you know what maybe I can still
save this look using a little bit of
blush to warm up that icy cheek ah ah
okay okay am i saving this look right
now am i saving this liquid I look like
one of those cheap clowns you get on a
Saturday morning because the best clown
in town was already booked okay you know
what
when all else fails just add a drag wig
and it works make it bigger make it
bigger and hide your face you know what
actually if we just use this as a beard
to cover up this face and then we just
cover all the horrible parts up with
hair and you're good all jokes aside
guys this was way harder than I thought
it was going to be I I kind of went into
this thinking I was gonna do a really
good job and once I did my eyes and
brows I was really feeling it but once
we went in on that skin it just all went
downhill and we ended up here being a
cheap as drag clown but nonetheless I
hope you enjoyed this video and that you
