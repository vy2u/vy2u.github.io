before we start put some sunglasses on
you'll probably need it today I'm here
to show you my recreation of Maria's a
full phase using only highlighters
makeup challenge I don't think it was
actually a challenge but if you've
noticed Geoffrey just uploaded his
version and I'm uploading my version and
we're creating a challenge so basically
this challenge is doing your face with
highlighters only chromey pigmented
highlighters whatever highlighter you
have smack it on your face and work it I
highly suggest you checking out Maria
she was to create her up this all and
she looked fabulous and I love her and I
am here to do my part yeah without any
further ado if you would like to know
how to get this glazed donut makeup look
then keep on watching all right so
before we start this highlighter crease
I'm first gonna work on my eyes cuz I
like to lean on my face while doing my
eyes so to get my face in that glowy
manner I first have to glow up my eyes
so first gonna go in with a primer to
make my eyes last all damn home alright
the first color I'm going to go in with
is by Anasazi Beverly Hills and this is
golden bronze illuminator and what's a
morphe M 504 brush I'm just going to
define my crease this is so unnatural to
me because I never put anything shiny my
crease my crease is always matte for
definition and by putting the shimmer in
it feels wrong but it is cool alright so
we got our crease going on it's time
time to focus on the lid gonna take this
Vanessa Marik's a light pigment in the
color aura of tranquility but before I
put that on my lips I firs going to
apply a small layer of Mac mixing medium
eyeliner so just a small small thin
layer all over the lid to make
a highlighter pop I can't with this
thing man it's so good also can I get a
round of applause for our new family
member here to further brighten the eyes
and in a chorus I'm gonna go in with
pearl by Becca of course of course this
has to be in this video so I'm just
gonna blow up my inner corners like so
close-up video with color brain clutch
pearls gonna highlight my brow bone all
right I'm gonna put a little bit of
coverage underneath my eyes cuz I will
not let my dark circles ruin my glow so
I'm gonna go in with my Oprah absolute
cover foundation in number one and I'm
just going to cover up my dark circles
and our best friend all right I'm going
to go in with another donessa maverick
and light pigment this is a copper and
this is in the color aura of desire and
this will be going on to my lower lash
line now going back in with golden
bronze by on the size of reveals to kind
of smudge it out
and now to really spark up that in a
corner I'm again going into another
alight highlighter by Vanessa Marik's
this is in the color aura of light very
fitting alright so this is all the
definition I want it for my eyes now
let's focus on the Copa let's focus on
the glow for the face I have just a
little bit of foundation on but I'm
gonna set my entire face using another
highlighter by Vanessa nerds and essa
Marik's highlighters are the bomb this
is in the color aura of radiance and it
has a lovely golden tone the golden tone
is gonna be everywhere this is the
moment my life has led up to I'm about
to transform into my final form picking
up the highlighter I'm just brushing it
all over baby yes yes yes I feel amazing
oh my god it's like alright so this is
our base glow yes
alright I got to start contouring my
face using the mimosa glow kit color by
on the size of Beverly Hills as well
for blushing and I used Becca's
rose-gold
sprintgod my whole life feels like a lie

attendant for this is my ultimate life I
