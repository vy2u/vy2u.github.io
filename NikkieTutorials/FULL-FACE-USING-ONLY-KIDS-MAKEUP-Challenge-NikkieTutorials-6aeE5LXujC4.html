for a fun new full face using only
challenge and after I did my full face
using only highlighters and liquid
lipsticks challenge videos a lot of
people wanted to see a full face using
only kids makeup challenge and when I'm
talking kids makeup I'm like literally
talking kids makeup like the shebang
so I went on an excessive shopping spree
I bought a lot a lot of children's
makeup and Joe's makeup is like frickin
expensive is it like shocked me I was
shook this cost me like $30 and this
baby right here was about $40 so kids
make it as expensive see it without any
further ado today I'll be doing my full
face using only kids makeup and I still
do it so the first product I'm gonna go
in with is by Claire's and Claire's
actually had a BB cream in the color
light oh that's actually it's actually
light oh my god so I also bought a bunch
of brushes at Claire's so those are the
only brushes I'll be using today all
right so I'm just gonna use one of these
little blush brushes for my foundation
and let's see how this BB cream goes I
don't think I've ever seen something go
on so streaky oh shit that looks
horrible
it's like literally one second you look
Oh God coverage and the second later
you're like and streakiness by I feel
like that's doing exactly nothing for my
face but if you're ever proud of your
skin texture don't apply this because
you will not be proud of your skin
texture anymore for concealer I found at
Claire's also a concealer stick so it's
that same brush I'm just gonna pot it in
it's actually the color of my skin tone
so I'm going to use this as a third
layer foundation this brush is like
creating a new skin texture for me it
looks like a I look like a golf
tournament I'm like hole-in-one multiple
holes in one
so I also bought this kids eye shadow
palette but when I opened it we have all
these amazing shadows but when you
switch it to the side we have a face
palette and I was so shocked I saw this
highlighter color right here it's
actually so pigmented so I'm gonna use
that to further highlight my under eyes
and with the rest of the colors I'm
gonna set my face oh my god
kids makeup have shades that are wide
enough for my face what I've been doing
all this time
and I'm also going to pick up a little
bit of the white powder on my pinky and
highlight my nose because I feel like my
nose got a little bit lost and then
brush away and now I feel like I have a
face I can actually work with I know my
under eyes look super crazy right now
but they always do until the very end um
okay let's do brows all right for brows
is going to hop on to this next pile
right here I bought this also at a kid's
store and I opened it up and it's
actually really really cute and these
glitters are life the only downside to
these achill ITER's right here is that
once you touch them it's like a
overspray it's like a
on top of something greasy so you have
like one tiny thin layer of glitter and
then you have like fast a lien or
something I'm going to do my brows using
this color right here and this color
right here something and also at
Claire's I bought one of these nail art
brushes right here so I'm going to try
to delay abroad with that I also bought
one of these bullies I'm gonna brush my
hair's down
and then with another Claire's brush I'm
going to fill everything in using the
same colors
and then I'm going to clean up using
that concealer stick again alright so we
did the skin we did the brows now it's
time to focus on some fun eyes I want to
create like the colorful princess like
fierce eyes because it's a challenge so
because I don't have an eyeshadow base
anywhere I am going to go in with that
same white powder and apply it all over
in hopes of it like doing stuff I swear
to god that white powder has already
save me like a lot today um so you
better not leave me don't know I'm gonna
go into this mini eyeshadow palette who
the smells really intense that smells
very chemical I'm like are these
companies trying to kill our children
look how cute it is though oh it's so
cute they trying to kill us but it's
cute I'm gonna go in with this hot pink
right here and I'm going there and I am
going to apply that into my crease okay
oh there she is
come on give us some payment come on
don't be afraid show yourself she's
coming she needs her time
now going back to this cutesy eye shadow
palette right here I'm going to go into
the color right there and I'm going to
use this to darken the edges uh-huh
you know these eye shadows just need a
little bit of love and a lot of time
all right further lid I found this super
cute palette at Claire's as well this is
called the brights eyeshadows by Technic
I'm like a kiss makeup I've really
stepped up their game lately we did not
have this when I was a child and I'm
going to go in with this pink shadow
right here and that is going on my lid
all right I think that's enough for now
for the top live let's focus on the
bottom and going back in with that
bright spell I'm really liking this one
for the lower lash line I'm going to go
in with this beautiful blue I really
want that like princessy like colorful
fierce looks so blue it is and then from
this palette right here I'm going to
grab a bunch of the blues and just work
with it now with a white I'm trying to
highlight my inner corners and I also
found at Claire's a liquid liner looks
like this and you know what I'm gonna
use it all right I think that's the best
I can do for now normally I would say
when it looks like a mess I throw
glitter on top but the only glitter I
have are these like weird Vaseline based
like glitters that only have a tiny bit
of glitter on the layer of Vaseline so
I'll pass all right for lashes I'm going
to use the new bouncing Russian black is
anyone noticing that I'm going to go for
big lashes to hide my mistakes
it's now time to focus on the face going
back to this pal right here because this
has been a lifesaver so far today
and I'm going to do a little bit of
bronzing and contouring using this one
right here okay okay boom shit okay yep
that looks like mud mud but we're gonna
work with it for blush I'm going to go
into this beauty right here and this has
some really nice sparkly ones so I'm
just gonna dunk my brush in all three
and really smells like baby powder and
then anyone nope nothing okay bye
alright Minnie save the day
alright and then for my glow today on
the mini palette has like a really
beautiful shimmering gold right here and
I have this nail art brush that I got at
Claire's as well what does I'm going to
try to glow up my life oh look it works
this just saved the day I swear Minnie
Mouse you are the real glowing God right
here and then I'm also gonna highlight
the bridge of my nose and the tip of it
oh my god it almost has like a
Tinkerbell greenish goldish reflection
this highlighter is lit Cupid's well
it's a greenish you're harder on
associatively hills moonchild alright
and for a lipstick I'm gonna go in with
one of these classics right here going
to go for the lightest pink
the coverage of this is unreal
and therefore lip gloss
I found this lip gloss called this is it
get some Michael Jackson up in here and
oh oh oh my god that's really pigmented
