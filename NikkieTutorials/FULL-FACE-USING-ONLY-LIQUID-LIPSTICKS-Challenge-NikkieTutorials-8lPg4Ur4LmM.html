face using only liquid lipsticks makeup
challenge it was so intimidating but
this is what came out and this challenge
was originally made by Amy here on
YouTube and I'll put her link down below
on her original video she did such an
amazing job as well as Jeffrey and Manny
I think they really rocked it so I'm
here to do my part of this challenge and
I had so much fun I highly suggest you
trying this out cuz it's really like
challenging you really want to you know
you really want to nail it but it's hard
so yeah without any further ado if you
would like to know how to get this all
liquid lipstick makeup look then keep
watching alright we're doing with this
I am so flipping nervous right now
alright so let's take this challenge by
the balls and let's let's do it okay so
the first product I'm gonna go in with
is of course a liquid lipstick this one
is by dose of colors and this is in the
color sand now this is gonna be too dark
for me so I'll be mixing it using my
favorite velour liquid lipstick and
druglord by Jeffrey Stark and I signed
Jeffrey and Manny's video that you have
to work in portions cuz if you apply it
all over the face and then start
blending it in you're too late cuz it
dry so quickly so you're gonna work in
portions today okay I got the mixture
right here okay oh I think I have a good
color match thank God that looks pretty
good
you guys I think that's a really good
color match oh my god at least one thing
has succeeded so far I was so scared I
was gonna look like a My Little Pony a
pastel My Little Pony I do notice though
that you have to use a lot of product to
cover a huge face so that's that keep on
Ness of wasting product but it's so hard
to find yellow based liquid lipsticks
cuz a lot of people want yellow on their
lips they just want a pinky comb so it's
hard but sand by dose of colors you're
doing it baby anyone on a budget of
watching this video I'm so sorry
so many of you have been requesting a
waterproof makeup tutorial well I think
this is it I mean there's one product on
planet earth that will nug budge as
liquid lipstick so so if you want like a
hardcore waterproof summer makeup
tutorial well baby here you go okay I'm
gonna go in with a drug lord mostly and
mix a little bit of sand into it for
concealer see the word thing with this
challenge is I was like oh but what am I
gonna use to bake you can't bake I like
this
okay druglord us to you I'm also gonna
put it over my lid as a base sort of
okay okay concealing highlighting my
face I've got one thing I'm noticing it
feels very dry and tightening on the
face rich you know all about oh yeah I
want to get rid of that under-eye
creasing this video is not it oh you
wanted to minimize the appearance of
course not this video alright we got our
base done I think I might have went a
little bit too light but we're still
going to contour instance that it's
going to be tragic um I think I'm okay
with this for brows I'm going to go in
with a Geoffrey start posh spice and a
tiny bit to make it a little bit more
gray with a Staten Island by Oprah
oh okay okay I fucked up okay I didn't
want a blurry brow my makeup artist cry
right now
just like Manny did I'm gonna highlight
underneath to clean up all that works
really nice actually oh yes oh yes
cut the bleeding of way bitch can't we
get brows all right we got the brows on
we're totally gonna ignore the fact that
one is straight and one has the arch
let's go on to eyes and I'm actually
really excited about this cuz I got some
new products we grab them
I ordered the brand new Milani metallic
liquid lipsticks and I thought these
would be perfect as like a beautiful
shimmering eyeshadow on the lid so I'm
going to go in with a couple of these
colors right here then start blending
and I know it's going to be a really
tough challenge to blend it out nicely
but there's willingness in my body here
the first color going to go in with is
the Milani metallic a more metallics lip
cream and the color materialistic I'm
just gonna pounce it on to the OP oh
okay that's dark okay on the inner and
outer corner oh that is a beautiful
color
alright and then with a brush
instead oh god that's really pigmented
oh okay okay I didn't think oh oh oh
you're almost dry okay Oh mother of the
Golan God's help me blendin that Chris
thank you blend please oh my god come on
come on blend
I love that once you blend it it kind of
takes away the metallic no so it just
becomes a knight's matte like transition
shade get going and with the tiny bit
more to darken my tiny M you like super
tiny don't know don't go patchy on me
now with druglord and sand I'm going to
clean up the edges and try to blend this
a little we got that on the center of
the lid I'm gonna go in with this
beautiful shade right here this is the
Milani metallic lipstick in the colour
automatic touch oh shit that's right
okay okay movie agents
and then on the center of that pink I'm
going to go in with another Milani one
this is in the color mad about you
alright for the lower lash I don't want
to go smoky so I'm gonna go in with
Oprah Harlem alright to make this look a
little bit more interesting I'm going to
create a new sort of in a corner not all
the way all right and then on the inner
corners a little bit of druglord to open
up that eye all right I think it's time
for some liquid liner using weirdo by
Jeffrey star aren't going to take a tiny
bit of white and highlight the inner
corners here alright the lashes I'll be
using today are by Lily lashes these are
mikonos Oh eyes are on I know people are
gonna say that putting eyelashes on is
cheating you know what sometimes it
gotta break the rules because the lashes
are my life support it's time to contour
I'm actually really nervous about this
clip my face is like super tacky and
Suqian but we're gonna contour going to
use my coloured raine marshmallow with a
teensy bit of Posh Spice
alright to contour gonna use this makeup
geek angled stippling brush picking up a
tiny tiny bit just a tiny bit and I'm
using stippling motions I'm patting the
brush up and down onto my face and I'm
going to smear it around because then
I'm going to lift the liquid lipstick
foundation base
so by stippling it you can blend it
without like messing up the base alright
for blush I'm going to make a
combination with these two right here
this is Geoffrey star seven one four and
Milani cinematic kiss to give it a
little bit of a shine
what's your go alright then for
highlighter the only option I had was
this Oprah long lasting liquid lipstick
in Times Square this is like straight-up
silver and that will leave a really
weird-looking cast on my face I'm gonna
mix it with white to hopefully make it a
little bit more appropriate for my skin
tone you know it's not every day that I
say no to the silvers surfaced come on
my face but today I'm seeing no to it oh
oh oh I see you highlight okay oh okay
how are you doing all right that worked
great the brush I'm using for this is a
morphe m5a1 okay could just quickly look
at my hand it's oh my face is on my hand
right now all right
my lips are first applying mannequin by
Jeffrey star I love how easy do ellipses
now and then to make it a little bit
more nude and give it a nice twist I'm
applying druglord to the center like
that I did it and that guys concludes my
