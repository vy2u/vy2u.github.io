full face using only challenge makeup
challenge and today is a really exciting
one because I'll be doing the full face
using only my hands and fingers no
brushes makeup challenge this challenge
has been around for a long while because
before it was called the no brushes
makeup challenge and I've actually done
this before with my friend Sharon for
her channel in Dutch so I feel like
somehow I'm a little bit more prepared
for what's to come
I love that videos a long time go and it
totally messed up and it looked like
freaking mess so my goal here is for
today's look to absolutely nail it I've
seen so many amazing creations with this
and I'm like how how say this challenge
has been around for a while and in the
description box below I will credit who
I got the idea from today so without any
further ado I reckon nervous alright
here we go alright the first thing I'll
be doing is my brows because the way I'm
gonna work around with this is brows
carving them up with concealer eyes
foundation contouring the whole shebang
and then hopefully we look somewhat good
so the first thing I'm going to go in
with is by Tarte this is the ash blonde
Amazonian clay one proof brow mousse and
I am gonna do my brows with this and an
amazing trick I've seen on Jamil rights
channel the girl that totally inspired
me to do this is she cars she just she
just slapped the brow stuff on and
carved him out with concealer and they
look like perfection so that's what I'm
going to do oh my god it's underneath my
nail another amazing thing for me is
that I have super super thick fingers my
fingers are large and in charge
so I have like no precision or
whatsoever
we're just darkening that brow up baby
boom boom boom my makeup artist aching
right now a king I'm telling you
anything I feel beautiful and now with
concealer the trick is to carve this out
into perfection which I don't foresee
that happening but we're gonna try
no wait hot well oh it's just
mixing in oh no no oh my god no no no no
oh my god
I'm in pain top the front we want a nice
fade okay okay I've worked on this brow
for like a good 30 minutes and they're
so much concealer on this eye but you
know what it's a bitchin brow okay first
I'm going to try and wipe off some of
the brows stuff because I feel like that
was really messing with the concealer so
okay so this has taken me a good twenty
five to thirty minutes all right we
tackled that now my main philosophy when
it comes to makeup is when you mess
something up at glitter so this is
exactly what I have planned for today
that's behind me baby
oh all I'm thinking with this video is
wrinkles wrinkles everywhere alright the
first color I'm going to grab is my
color pop this is kpop wilshire k-pop
wheels shirt I'll be grabbing the morphe
e23 I'm just going to pick them up and
this is going to be my transition shade
okay and the higher I get up just like
with a brush the less pressure I put on
the brush to create a gradient and a
fade so the higher you go the less
pressure you want to apply
now to deepen and darken I'm going to go
in with kpop Cranshaw
Crenshaw and I'll be using one thing or
to apply one fear to buff and one thing
or to fade you guys this is by far the
hardest challenge ever the liquid
lipstick one was by far the easiest the
kids makeup challenge was just having
fun the highlighter challenge was the
day of my life but this right here is so
hard
alright I found out that patting the
color puff shadows in will help blend it
a little teensy bit more I swear this
videos like m+ dabbing on my dabbing on
my eye for the lid I'm gonna go in with
some heavy duty I'm gonna go in with the
color pop shadow in ratchet this why
what they call such a beautiful color
ratchet and I'm going to pop this all
over my lid up into the crease we're
going to go super super smoky and
glittery and sexy hopefully
so like I said padding at the edge where
you think it needs more blending really
works
alright cleaning up the edge again hmm
hmm I can live with this oh right okay
now for the glitter this is to hide all
my mistakes and to bring all the
attention to the sparkles instead of my
blending so I'm going to go in with the
lids glitter in under cover and as the
base I'll be dabbing on some going on
I'll be dabbing on some lit clearly
liquid glitter base right here we go oh
yes this is what I came for
oh all is right in the world again hello
I'm gonna highlight my inner corners
using Kat Von D's a thunderstruck I'm
without that as stunning I think that
would be a good time to apply some
falsies I'm not gonna even think about
mascara because though so I'm gonna use
my any tude bossy lashes
okay now that we've got these lashes on
finally which I love these is time to
focus on this face because it's a mess
so I'm gonna go in first to hydrate with
my first Sally rose gold elixir to
hydrate and just prime oh my god this is
relaxing ly easy for a foundation today
I'm gonna go in with the Oprah absolute
cover in point 5 and warm this way by
Too Faced in pearl oh my god I hate
applying foundation with my hands it's
up I hate it with a passion
for concealer abusing the tart shaped
tape concealer and of course I cannot
use the wand so on the back of my hand
it goes whoo I love this stuff so much
it will cover up anything all right now
I'm going to bake my under-eye area
using my NARS soft velvet loose powder
and snow just to prevent any creasing
really pushing that into my fine lines
oh god oh god that is way too much okay
I might have made a mistake with that
all right now with my Armani a luminous
soap powder going to set the rest of my
face because I'm looking like an oil
slick
alright I'm going back in with some
thunderstruck by Kat Von D because I
feel like all the concealer covered up
that magical in a corner hello there now
going back into kpop Crenshaw bicolor
pop and just on the tip of my finger and
then pick that up just a tiny bit like
that and I'm going to smudge that on my
lower lash line
and now going in with Quatro Quatro out
on a cuatro and I'm gonna use that on
the very outside corner to darken it
even more and thus I'm putting it on the
tip of my pinky there you go so I'm
gonna grab my Kevin a Kwan at medium
sculpting powder and I'm gonna blend it
out see if I would have gone directly
onto my face with this it would have
like that so I'm gonna smudge it out
here on the back of my hand and then I
have the balls to contour whoo hey hey
come on
cheekbones just circular motions don't
put too much pressure on that face
so you smoke it out and for blush I'm
going to go into these you way
mineralize a powder blush in blossom and
just same technique I'm first gonna pick
it up with my finger and then go on the
back of my wrist oh there we are
there we are all right and now for my
favorite part might glow I'm gonna go in
with the Ofra Beverly Hills highlighter
and I'm gonna make a mixture between the
white color right here and the more
champagne color right on the other side
of it and I am gonna glow
everyone's eyes out so they don't see my
fucked-up brand-new.this glow you guys I
am done
you know actually I'm going to pick up a
little bit of that white and also put
that on my inner corners because it is
just blinding and I love it there we are
hello
holy shebang
her lips I want to keep it easy and go
for a nude because I love the glitter
and the glow so I want all the tension
to go to that so I'm going to go in with
my Tom Ford a nude vanilla I know people
are getting so sick of me using this but
it is my life right now
and more
