sailor alright that's it
but that's it yes but mom what is this
concealer okay
I'm sealing it all by the way okay do
you only have two brushes yes
just these two God thank you mom thank
you okay so I am in my studio now with
the stuff that my mom uses for her
makeup and I will say that with my mom
basically I get so many packages from
like PR and whatever I don't like I
always give away either in like
giveaways or like to my friends or
charity but also mostly my mom so a lot
of the stuff that I see right here is
stuff that I have given her like even
the past week like this highlighter
right here this doll light highlighter
by doll beauty I literally gave her that
like five days ago and this I've known
those little things since my past she
has always had one of these stacked with
all her products in it it's like her
daily little stash then I also see this
right here this is by Senza I was just
talking about that brand yesterday it's
a BB cream it's a BB cream in lovely
radiance golden honey
that's gonna be too dark for me oh this
Becca palette I gave her this because
it's so my mom like the packaging is
totally my mom let me see if she
actually she has not even touched these
shadows so this is the stuff I am
allowed to use today and yes so without
any further ado who is ready for winter
wonder week day six do my full face
using my mom's makeup
like literally what is in here mascara
mascara spiked brow pencil by Mac okay
eyeliner eyeliner more brows more
eyeliner my mom is addicted to mascara
and eyeliner and she literally has two
brushes a pencil brush she does her
shadows with pencil brushes all right
wish me luck so the first product I see
is the Bobbi Brown vitamin enriched face
base well she's been digging into this
one okay so I'm gonna grab a little bit
of that to sort of prime alright then as
far as I know my mom doesn't use any
foundation she uses BB Creams this one
does my sends that like I said BB cream
lovely radiance golden honey gonna be so
dark on me oh my god
oh mama okay then I grab her brush and
we start buffing this into I don't think
that it's my exact shade match as you
can see my mom is a little bit more tan
than her daughter I don't even think
this is my mom's color like my mom is
not this tan oh my god stop okay wait
huh rub this it it's starting to dry
into mom this is not even your color
what are you doing I mean no wonder she
always says no to me when I ask her if
she needs any bronzer I mean this is all
the bronzing for her art time for
concealer she has his Marc Jacobs
remarkable concealer okay and she does
not have a brush for this so I'm just
gonna use my mom that's light I'm just
gonna tap this under Neath my eyes and
all the areas that needed to
lighten and conceal I really get this
base towards an acceptable level of
fairness I mean who is ready for the
natural makeup challenge 2.0 I feel like
this is gonna be the follow-up video
that is still very very oh my god look
at that look look at that okay time to
set using the laura mercier setting
powder and translucent you know what to
bake I'm gonna try a column round
because I'm not baking with this like a
powder puff honey I am setting with this
cut around to rescue yes people it is
December 29th 2017 and I am powdering my
face using a cotton round because my mom
only has one brush so I saw about 20
brow products in here this is an
eyeliner brow brow my mom has four brow
pencils in her stash I swear this is
about to be the natural makeup challenge
to point out there we go that's better
okay some brow gel I'm so thankful she
has this to bring back a little bit of
life into those hairs okay let me add my
second brow alright so that are those
are some uneven oh okay for eyes I did
see it primer Laura Mercier what is this
i basics flax so when i think of my mom
and i shadow there's one thing that I
will never forget from my childhood and
that is that my mom used to have duo
eyeshadows so it were too little eye
shadows in one little compact and she
would always have two of the duo's one
of the duo's would be a bronze and
champagne duo so one side was a
beautiful shimmering like darkish bronze
color and the other side was a beautiful
champagne shimmer and I always remember
her applying the dark bronzy shimmering
shade on her lid and then blending it as
far as we could call it blending then
blending it into her crease and then she
would put the shimmery champagne color
on her brow bone and that I remember so
vividly from my childhood that my mom
always always used to wear like that
I also remember that for her fancy days
for her nights out or for like a special
event she had another one of those duos
which was I believe like an emerald
turquoise color with a blue and she
would put the blue underneath so on her
lower lashline and to this day my mom
will often apply a blue liner to her
waterline to kind of because my mom has
the most beautiful intense blue eyes
hence why I'm wearing these blue
contacts today to kind of pay homage to
her but my mom has the most beautiful
blue eyes and I always remember that she
would put the blue shadow underneath and
I'd be like oh my god your eyes are so
blue and still to this day like I said
she will wear a blue liner like in her
waddle and to sort of get the same
effect I taught her not to go as like
heavy with the blue underneath anymore
so I really like this Becca palette that
I gave her a couple of weeks ago and
like I said she has not dipped into this
and if I have to choose like one color
that was difficult I had a duo that I
talked about was this color right here
would this color right here so this one
and this one was like a little duo
together I just remember that it would
always be on her vanity and sometimes I
would sneak in and like kind of apply to
my eyes and hoping that she wouldn't
notice but she always noticed okay so
I'm going to apply that one shade that I
talked about the bronzer shade
this blending is gonna be a challenge I
need to gift my mom a blending brush
like a zoeva 227 ASAP I love my mom so
much my mom has always been there for me
like I got bullied as a kid so much and
I would come home crying and the only
person that was able to sort of like
lift my spirits and make me feel good
again was my mom and my mom has always
had my back in every situation in my
life the the way my family found out
about my YouTube channel was during
Christmas about like six years ago and
my brother found one of my videos online
and during Christmas dinner brought it
up so I ran up the stairs and locked
myself up in my room and my mom was the
first to come up to my room and be like
honey this is incredible what you're
doing is so incredible and I'm so
incredibly proud of you and why the hell
you're speaking English I can always
count on mama tutorials I can always
count on her and having my back and
supporting me and giving me the best
advice and sometimes I don't even have
to say anything and she will know what I
feel or what I'm thinking or what I you
know how I'm handling things all right
now I may use this middle shade right
here the highlighter shade and do a
little bit of highlighting with it also
putting that on my brow bone time for a
mascara and she has two in a little
stash
I am so using these lashes to save this
look
oh here's the blue liner so my mom
always uses the Mac technical liner in
smooth blue every day on her waterline
to open up those eyes and make her eyes
look even more blue so I am gonna do
that too as an homage yes mom
okay what else you got mom I see okay
that highlighter again so I am I'm using
a common round again cuz she only has
one brush oh hell yeah oh I am here to
save this look with a little bit of glow
hello there
alright and then lastly for lips because
she has no blush no bronzer no contour
no anything I feel like she does all the
bronze in with that BB cream and so
lastly I know I gave this to her as a
present but she thinks it's too pretty
to use this is the rose gold lip topper
by Z way she loves this but she thinks
it's too pretty to you so she doesn't
use it so I am using it today oh my god
I cannot say this bronze for it anyways
that is how I do my face using all my
mom's makeup and woah
so that guy's is how I do my face using
only my mom's makeup products what do
you think it is a look for sure this is
definitely not how I would do my makeup
on a day-to-day basis as you know but
still this is so good for this spirit it
definitely took me on a trip down memory
lane and I just want to say mom I love
you so much you are the best and most
beautiful person in my world my favorite
