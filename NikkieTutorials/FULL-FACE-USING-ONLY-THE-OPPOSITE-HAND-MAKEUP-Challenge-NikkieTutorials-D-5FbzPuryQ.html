how I mess up my face today I am here to
show you the full face using only my
opposite hand makeup challenge and I
feel freaking nervous I am right-handed
just broken nail don't judge me I am
right-handed and um I feel pretty
comfortable with my right hand doing my
makeup every day but I know that RCL
Beauty did this a couple of years ago
and I know that my Ritesh of glam did it
recently so I got inspired by these two
beautiful ladies to do my rendition just
the thought of doing my full face with
my left hand has me shook in all honesty
my left hand is kind of dead to me so
yeah I cannot wait to see what kind of
hot mess is gonna end up looking like
but I am excited to finally tackle a new
challenge if you have any other
challenges do you want me to do please
let me know in the comment section down
below and dumb you don't need further
ado let's do this okay the first thing
I'm going to do is a PI Foundation today
I'm going to go for the Make Up For Ever
Ultra HD foundation sticks in the
colours 120 on the outer portion of my
face and 117 on the inner oh no even
holding the mirror in my right hand is
totally throwing me off oh my god it
feels so awkward
okay and then now for the lighter color
I know why does this feel so rough on
the skin as we know I like my foundation
so don't judge me on a pine a little bit
more okay now with my Beauty Blender if
I don't even hard to hold it okay my
right hand I hold it like this this so I
should like that oh my god no oh okay
we're patting it it's so rough why am I
so hard with my left hand keep tapping
this up and down up and down we go up
and now we go why do I feel like when I
use my right hand it's just my hand and
when I is my left hand it's my entire
left body
stop being so brutal with your
oh look nice though the foundation never
lets me down
oh stop cramping we just started ok Myra
said that applying foundation was easy
um I'm having a really difficult time
here so if she called that easy I don't
even want to know about the brows I'm
being so forceful with this left hand I
feel like I'm getting the most hardcore
massage ever oh ok foundation
miraculously is on for a concealer I'm
going to be using the Kat Von D lock-it
concealer cream I'm going to open it
with my right hand cuz mama mia kiss
your eyes we're talking about okay let's
get that 5 head in their nose no that's
a little lot on the nose chin okay
moment of truth
Oh Nicki be careful soften it soften it
okay yes I feel like the concealers
almost dry on this side taking me
forever okay now comes the moment where
I have to bake so I'm going to go in one
more time right underneath the eyes to
get rid of all those creases and go in
this is going pretty well
can't complain okay now I'm going to
powder the rest of my face you look an
idiot oh my god I am so freaking slow
using my left hand I feel like I'll be
doing my makeup for the next four hours
I sure to God if I would break my right
wrist or arm or whatever and I couldn't
use it I would
Ansel life now setting the bake
underneath my eyes okay I can live with
that and I made it look so easy I can
alright we did the face it's time to
move on to brows I really don't
oh I'm gonna look so atrocious at the
end of this oh my god oh no where are
you going with that
okay now filling this in using a brush
and some brow mousse oh my god I knew I
should have gone for a trendy no brow
look today okay actually going to clean
up with concealer now I don't know how
go in with a brow shadow and make it
sharper hopefully I've seriously spent
about thirty minutes on my brows only
I've had enough of these brows let's go
on to eyes and before I started
recording I was like you know what I'm
gonna do a weight liner because that's
going to be easy I don't think this
challenge is going to be too too hard I
was so wrong so I'm going to go in with
my paint pot by Mac to prime okay I'm
going to set my brow bone area to help
blending products that I put over top
later on and I need all the help I can
get oh my god why am I doing this
noise down
I'm going to go into the new color drain
Queen of Hearts I shadow palette I
swatch this on snapchat and it is
absolutely unreal I love the color
sipping mutation is awesome although at
this point I'm kind of wishing that I
have eyeshadows that are not pigmented
because all my mistakes are going to
show up with this one and I'm going to
go into this medium brown color right
here called royal prerogative
tap tap I want to die I want to fall
from the face of the earth I can't
disturb your emotions do you see this
wait hold on I'm trying to do my
circular motions to blend it's not
working
we're doing no makeup makeup look for
this one I mean everyone is always
nagging me to do it so why not do it
today with this challenge
okay smaller brush a darker Brown and
I'm going to try and get an outer corner
up in here
I'm going to go in with this color right
here called your majesty and now with a
brush I'm going to work that in to the
very inner corner up into my crease and
really giving it a nice well applied
feel of us the palette also has a
beautiful shimmering dark brown I kind
of want to play that to the center of
the lid and that one is called dethrone
its gonna dethrone this makeup look for
sure that did nothing okay so what I
think is really going to bring this a
look to life is a fierce inner corner
highlight so I'm gonna go in with my
sleek solstice highlighting palette
taking that goldish color and blind
hopefully see that looks yummy
yes all right I'm applying a mixture of
the medium and dark brown to the outer
corners of my lower lash line
I swear the faces that pull in this
video up
smokin that out using another more
pencil brush and then on the remaining
portion of the lower lash I'm going to
grab this color right here called
princess
I want to make the eyes just a little
bit more smoky and intense so I'm going
to cover most of the gold using that
brown color that did absolutely nothing
I wanted to do something so I'm going to
cover most of the gold
I'm pretty okay with this I create a
very warm toned dark smoky eyes now it's
time for lashes which I am not excited
about at all today I'm gonna go for my
Lily lashes in the style Miami nice and
flirty and long and I think that will
hide my mistakes a whole lot as well so
let me commit drop and stuff all this
tutorial so first let's tackle some
mascara and then lashes and then on to
the face oh my god
Oh
huh
okay a little bit of lower lashline
mascara
I'm now gonna go over to contouring my
cheekbones just going to take my bro
dial number three instaglam contour
powder huh and this brush right here and
I'm gonna go lightly because judging by
how harshly handed I was with my
foundation I don't want my contour to
become Trixie Mattel in two seconds I
swear to God the hardest part about this
challenge has been doing my right side
of my face for blush I'm going to be
using Milani zat luminoso it's back and
better than ever
okay then for highlighter like I said I
want to glow I'm gonna blind so I'm
gonna go in with that sleek highlighter
palette again and taking that same inner
corner highlight color there we go
you know no one's even gonna see my
mistakes because I'm blinding that with
this blow this is not going in any
direction that I wanted to go but it
will work and for lips I wanted to do
glossy nude lips so you wouldn't see my
mistakes but I'm not giving up right now
we've come this way it's looking
approachable so I'm gonna go with the
Kylie cosmetics matte liquid lipstick in
Coke okay
okay so bottom lip is super easy to do
it's that Cupid's bow that's got me
worried oh my god no don't just plump
she's a little bit overdrawn and plump I
actually kind of like that overdrawn
this alright just set this look into
place I'm going to set my face using my
NYX do we finish setting spray and um we
call it a day and that guys concludes
this full face using only the opposite
hand makeup challenge this took me a
very very long time I think I did like
three hours to do my makeup for this
challenge but I survived judging by the
way I look right now I I'm really okay
with the eyes and the lips and the
contour and the glow the only part that
is really killing it for me right now
are the brows they're super uneven they
are not how they should be behaving but
I did it either way
