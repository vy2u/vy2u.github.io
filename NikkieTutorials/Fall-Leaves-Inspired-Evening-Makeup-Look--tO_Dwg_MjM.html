am going to do a tutorial on this look
right here
I was super duper inspired by dad trees
all the leaves are changing and the
leaves are so so pretty there are
emerald greens coppers oranges Browns so
today I'm startup gonna do an inspired
fall leaf evening makeup tutorial I
think that will kind of fit what I'm
having on my face right now
not that anyone really wants to look
like a leaf in modern days but today we
we will look like a leaf and if you want
to know how to get this sort of evening
fall inspired look then please keep
button watching as always the first
thing I'm going to do is apply a base to
my eyelids to prevent the items from
creasing and I'm using my Mac soft ochre
Paint Pot ok so let's start off by
defining the outer parts of our creases
with a shade ster blush by Mac so just
at the outer part of your crease start
defining it
Yanis for the inner part of my crease
I'm gonna use rule eyeshadow by Mac and
just to find the inner part of your
crease with this and then blend it with
shade stir as one does then I'm gonna
take some OS silk eyeshadow by Mac it
sort of uses as in transition color and
just give that a nice blend for the
outer corner of my eyes I'm gonna use
Mac's mystery eyeshadow those are
someone's waiting for me outside with
this you want to go on to the outer part
of your lower lash line and go in a
little teeny tiny bit and then go into
your crease with this and make it a
really nice oval shape okay back to the
lip to make my green pop a little bit
more I'm first gonna put a white base on
on my lid Fred is amusing Mike
omma graphic pencil by Mac in pure white
as I said just apply this as a base to
make the green pop and for the green I
will be using Mac's humid and velvet
moss
I can't believe my oh my a stop it's
green and green then even more green and
then just Pat that on to your eyelids oh
it's so foolish Asst it's so pretty and
I don't even like green go figure
then remember mystery eyeshadow yeah me
neither put that on the remaining outer
part of your lid and blend it in with
the green and then sort of darken up the
entire outer part right here as well and
go a little bit down into sort of
in-between the orange and the green so
orange green in between and just blend
that really nicely together okay for the
bottom I'm just gonna put the two green
colors underneath this well and kind of
go to the inner corner and leave a
little gap open for some gold and with
my eyes I like to go a little bit more
down pretty inner corner highlight I'm
going back with my white pencil quickly
highlighting the very inner corners with
an off-white matte eyeshadow and blend
it in ephra the inner corners are gonna
use amber lights and gold mine and then
underneath I'm gonna define a little bit
more with shade stir blush by Mac and
this will give it a really nice deep set
sort of look for the glitter you guys
I'm opening it right now if I could ever
like ever award a company for Best
glitter
it's either lit when I'm showing you
right now or OCC cosmetics this glitter
right here by lit called
a soul sister is all over my desk this
glitter you guys is like fall glitter in
a
it is insane this resembles every single
fall leaf color that you can think of so
again that is soul sister by lit and I
will be applying that with my lid
clearly liquid glitter base and this is
awesome as well and I'm sort of gonna
apply it to like the middle of my lid so
sort of when I blink my eyes my eyes
look wet because of the glitter and
literally just laid on top of the
glitter base and you just want to make
sure that as this is drying don't look
up because the glitter is still drying
and when you look up there will be a
crease in your glitter and it will look
all wonky and weird this is why I love
my camera when I go back it goes out of
focus and then you can really see that
sparkle of that glitter look at how
amazing that is
okay I'm gonna do some off-camera work
now I'm gonna line my waterline using
this NYX slide-on pencil in tropical
green I'm gonna put some mascara on my
lashes and this is the Shiseido perfect
mascara defining a volume mascara if
relaxed I'm just gonna fill up my
corners right here I'm gonna use these
bronzes individual eyelashes number 43
never ever heard of this brand before
but I saw them lying in my laying where
they're lying or laying nobody I'm gonna
use this lashes and I'm just gonna cut
up the outer third part so cut and then
put that on your outer part of your lash
line okay so I already quickly did my
lips umm I kept it really really simple
not too nude not too dark neutral so not
nude not dark just in between afresh to
use the Clinique chubby stick
moisturizing a lip color balm in number
twelve oversized orange jaw it's really
really sure
fruity cheeks I'm first gonna contour a
bit with my NYX blush in taupe and then
on your temples as well and going onto
your forehead warming up my face a
little bit more with my illamasqua blush
in disobey for blush I'm going to use
this super gorgeous shimmery color this
is blusher Lumiere by makeup studio and
this is elegant beige smile put it on
them apples girl and then as a
highlighter I'm gonna use my extra
dimension skin finish by Mac in whisper
of guilt and that guys completes my fall
leaves inspired sort of evening makeup
