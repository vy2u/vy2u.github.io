do this really really artsy fartsy
eyeliner look it's really graphic it's
really sort of retro but futuristic as
well and I'm if I'm gonna show you how
this is going to be foolproof you can
fix this and make it look like
perfection so I guess you want to know
how to get this then please keep on
watching okay first things first I'm
just gonna highlight the inner part of
my little bit and my brow bone just to
give the eye somewhat more sort of rest
and look more perfection and then I'm
just gonna take a really natural sort of
skintone color and I'm just gonna define
my crease a little tiny bit to give it a
little bit more definition and depth you
definitely do not want this to be a
harsh line because we're applying a
different really harsh line later on and
for the bottom lid I'm applying the
exact same color and just blend that in
and now it is time for the eyeliner I'm
gonna start off by applying just a
really simple cat eyeliner a winged
eyeliner and from there we're gonna make
sort of a line going into the crease and
then thicken that up so it's actually it
takes a little bit of time but it's kind
of easy
okay and I just make sure that this is
completely dry so it won't crease or
just smudge all over that's why I'm
looking all weird right now okay now
let's say you made a mess and you have
all those weird bumpy little things
right there that I have as well I ever
really neat trick for you take a little
brush like this and a matte skin powder
that matches your skin tone then with
that wet brush dip it into that net sort
of face powder or eyeshadow all you want
to do is sort of go over the black and
because we kept that lid color so
natural and so light you're sort of
erasing your mistakes so if you messed
up wet brush skin powder and just erase
them and with this you can make your
line SuperDuper sharp and with that
trick you can fool anyone into thinking
you're like the liner professional like
sort of perfectionist of the world this
will make any line sharp and work and
now I just went ahead and apply my false
lashes mascara and favorite lipstick for
any questions leave them in the comment
section below thank you guys so much for
watching I hope you enjoyed and
hopefully I will see you guys next time
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
