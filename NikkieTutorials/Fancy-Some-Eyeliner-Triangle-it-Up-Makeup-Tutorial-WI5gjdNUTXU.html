look right here and you might remember
this from my 2013 resolutions video that
I did back in January and if you haven't
seen that yet and go check it out you
can click right here but in the video I
was wearing this eyeliner and I got so
many requests for it and I'm finally
getting around to doing it so that's
basically all to it this is my second
installment for my fancy some eyeliner
series I'm really liking this right now
because I love eyeliner if you want to
know how to get this look just eyeliner
then please keep on watching as always
the first thing I'm going to do is apply
a base to my eyelids to prevent the
eyeshadow from creasing and I am using
my soft ochre Paint Pot by Mac okay when
I first gonna do is take a face powder
and highlight my brow bone and inner
parts of my eyes for the crease I'm
gonna make a mixture between Mac's
copper plate and kid eyes shadow and
really lightly you just want to start
applying these to the crease no hard
pressure at all just keep every movement
soft so that the color sort of dusts on
and just blend that crease out
completely with kid only and make the
gradient from crease to brow as soft as
you can and then to give the crease a
little bit more depth I'm just gonna
take copper plate only and just
intensified the crease with that a
little bit more not taking Samoas silk
eyeshadow by Mac and this color is going
all over the lid don't fill this entire
part up where the eyeliner is gonna be
with eyeshadow because then you won't
have that sort of gap that we want so
sort of leave the end out I'm gonna take
copper plate only again and apply this
to the lower lash line and with Blanc
type I should I'm gonna highlight my
inner corners it's a further highlight
that inner corner I'm gonna take vanilla
pigment by Mac and this for a pop of
shimmer and on the waterline I will be
applying some Ben Nye neutralized
crayon in light and b2 and for the
eyeliner it's kind of hard to explain so
I don't think I will be talking
throughout this part because I cannot
really explain it I'm gonna show it on
my other eye to kind of have a guidance
of what I did I started up with a basic
line all around my eyes and then winged
it tail up at this point right here and
therefore the triangle weird shape I
first made this line going into the
crease and then straight down and all
you want to do then is sort of thicken
up where you have to thicken up and sort
of at black where you have to add black
a further step I will be using my Mac
black track fluid line
okay so now I'm quickly gonna apply some
mascara this is my makeup studio
waterproof 3d extra black and then some
lashes I'm gonna use my miss Otero 747 m
on the lips I'm just applying my YSL
east san aha
and this is the Roush Philip pearl in
number 107 and this is just a really
nice glossy nude color you can go for
bright lips and such but I really want
all the attention to go to the eye liner
and that everybody completes my fancy
some eyeliner series second installment
I don't know what I'm gonna call this
yeah but I'm think I'm gonna call it
triangle it up or something with the
triangle so I really really like this
eyeliner and I don't know how I sort of
got this shape and I was just playing
around and then this came out so think I
guess so much for watching for a full
