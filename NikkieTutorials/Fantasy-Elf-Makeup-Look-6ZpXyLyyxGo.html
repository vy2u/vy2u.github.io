collaboration video with Emma pickles
here on YouTube and Emma is one of my
all-time favorites because she is hope
bloody talented I can't even so Emma and
I decided to do this first dwelling
creatures collab where we're both these
elves slash fairies that are in their
own world
and Emma is in a world where everything
is frozen therefore she's more of like a
winter fairy slash elf and on my part of
the world the frozenness hasn't reached
yet so I'm half naked and with brown
eyeshadow on so I'm an elf sigh fairy
and fairies have glitter everywhere and
that was my main key focus for this look
so I went ham on the sparkles and the
glitter and I even glittered up my
background so without any further ado if
you want to know how to get this look
right here then please stay tuned and
also don't forget to check out Emma's
video and show her some love because she
is awesome you will love her so yeah
guys let's go alright guys the first
products I'll be applying is by L'Oreal
and this is the lumi magique base primer
and this is just a really light
reflective primer which I love overly
glowy looks so this is going over my
entire face as a primer okay then for
foundation I'm going to take the hello
flawless by benefit and I'm the color
and pure for sure ivory and I'm first
just dotting this onto my face with my
finger and then with my Sigma F 88 I'm
going to buff this in
for concealer I'm of course using my
trusty Mac Pro Longwear in NC 15
and with my Sigma f80 6 I'm buffing this
in now I'm going to set this with powder
and do my brows off-camera and one eye
and then I will be back so as I was
doing my brows I was chatting away on
iMessage with Emma and I was like I
wanted to do glitter tucked me now I was
like I want to do glitter brows and she
was like oh shoot I wish I did it so I
was like ok then I will do it I will do
it now so I'm gonna take the oullette
clearly liquid glitter base as my
adhesive and the glitter I got from a
nail art store so this is actually what
they dump in acrylics for glitter it's a
nice pinky taupey color so this go on my
brows okay so it's difficuit it in the
adhesive and are now going to Pat it on
my brow and then take the glitter oh we
see a little sparkle there okay this is
fun I'm just going to keep adding more
glitter onto this look that and now I'm
going to carve them up with concealer
all right onto eyes I already did my
base I use my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot
and now onto the first shadow the first
shadow I'll be using is unaesthetic
beverly hills Birkin and I'm applying
this to my inner crease area this is
something you either love or hate but I
think that for this look it's amazing
because it just adds that sort of
mysterious pressure to the inside of
your eyes and then I'm also taking this
color and dragging it to the other side
of my crease just fill your entire
crease up with this color and then I
also like to wing it here for the lid
I'm taking max of blue brown pigment and
I'm applying this wet
and then quickly with a clean brush I
blend the edges out now going in a super
shock shadow by colour-pop and this is
sugar and because it sort of has the
color that blue Brown has as a as a sort
of reflex I'm going to use that as my
highlighting portion and then I start
tapping it over the blue brown pigment
and just go all the way up to the crease
and keep it mostly on the inner part
here taking another color pop super
shock shadow this is Liberty and for
these eyes I wanted to create this sort
of wet sequence feeling and by creating
a wet effect you kind of want to place
the highlights really close to the
crease and fading down so I pick up the
Liberty and I start applying it at the
top of my lid close to my crease and I
start highlighting there now going in
another Anastasia Beverly Hills eye
shadow this is Morocco and with this I'm
going to define the crease a little bit
more also because we just added that
highlighting trick and I just want my
crease to look snatched another
Anastasia Beverly Hills eye shadow I'm
taking blushing and I'm blending this on
the outer part of my lid and crease to
add a little bit of warmth and pink for
the lower lash line of taking anastasia
beverly hills eyes shadow in stone and
this is going from inner to outer corner
and i'm blending it very low down and
then now it's time for the fun part the
glitters i'm going to use the lit
clearly liquid glitter base as my
adhesive and i'm picking it up with a
q-tip and i'm just going to place that
where I want my glitter to be I'm going
to start off with my blue glitter first
and they're doing the same with my
silver
and that's also going on to my eyelids
and I'm using the same technique as I
did with highlighting this part here you
want to apply glitter right on that line
all you want to do now is apply some
falsies and abusing the House of lashes
temptress wispy okay for cheeks I
decided that this right here takes away
so much attention and I'm going to add
something to the lips later on that's
going to grab some attention too so I
want to keep the cheeks in peace just
let it rest as always at first
contouring my face using LM s because
eyeshadow in heroine
then a further bronzing up my face using
my Tarte Park F Princess contour palette
looks like this and the color is I don't
know and threw it away but it's this
color right here for blush I'm using
Milani baked blush powder in Luminoso
and I'm also draping this down from my
forehead and I'm also putting a little
bit underneath the tip of my nose I'm
highlighting using my Ben Nye Lumiere
looks powder because this gives me the
most amazing intense glow ever ooh mamma
ooh mamma sit down mamacita
then also let's not forget the news
keeps bow okay then for lips I'm going
to go in with my hourglass femme nude
nude number one lipstick okay then now
for the fun part in my previous video I
made that little gap between your
Cupid's bow so everyone and their
Cupid's bow has like a little dip here
most people do so yesterday in
yesterday's video I enhanced it and made
it more prominent and I was like why not
do that in color and then I saw that
dominique from baedal ash did it also so
I really liked how it looks on her so
I'm kind of taking inspiration from that
so first I'm taking a light blue this is
honest eyes de Rivoli hills ice blue
and then you guessed it I'm against
hanging that silver glitter and applying
it right in the middle and that guys
