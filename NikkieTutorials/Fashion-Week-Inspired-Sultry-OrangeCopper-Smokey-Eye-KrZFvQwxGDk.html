inspired by the runway Fashion Week um I
was inspired by summer spring looks but
kind of smoky as well I would wear this
too like if you have a session party or
if you're having fun with your friends
at night I'm gonna show you some tips
and tricks on how to get like that hi
models shine on your face um pause I'm
going to show you how to do these eyes
which is a really nice orange copper
smokiness so yeah if you want to know
how to get this then please keep on
watching ok so the first thing you want
to do is a pie baster I list to prepare
your eyeshadow from creasing and I'm
using my Mac painterly Paint Pot I'm
gonna take this grease paint stick from
Mac in the color brown now and with that
you're applying an eyeliner close to
your lash line and making a fake crease
so first just coat the lashes you don't
have to be super neat with this just I'm
good it everywhere and then follow the
direction of your lower waterline so run
there and then go into your crease I'm
going to take a really small square
brush like that and I'm gonna blend
everything just a little bit more smooth
so it's not all that harsh especially
that lining your crease right here you
want to follow that line all the way in
as well blended now I'm going to take a
small brush like this and I'm gonna take
embark from Mac and mix it a little
teeny bit with next bronze and start
going into the crease to blend it even
further and to make it even nicer then
just such a hard line just blend it and
make it smokey and remember my Lady Gaga
sees a glance video go all the way to
your nose and make those eyes look big
now what's a Mac 239 I'm going into
Meg's wood wing and a copper ring and
I'm going to mix those two together but
definitely more copper ring than the
wood wing and apply that to the lid I'm
going to make a mix of cork and Swiss
chocolate with that big blending brush
again and with that you kind of want to
blend that harsh line away here and also
make that like in a corner the Lady Gaga
trick really nice and intense
he's blended baby now if you feel like
you lost the intensity up and bark just
go back in it and make it darker again
okay meant for a brow bone highlight I'm
going to take a max pearl cream color
base just get some on your ring finger
and not too much and just dab it on the
highest point of your art and then blend
it out with a different finger okay for
the lower lash line I'm actually going
to use a pop of orange I'm gonna take a
orange lip pencil from Mac and once you
reach the outer corner just follow that
line that you already made now smoke
that line out a bit then on that outer
corner right here make a jar which is
like the embark so it kind of matches
let's set that orange eyeliner from Mac
I'm going to take max eyeshadow incest
Ron I can line your waterline I'm going
to use the Mac chrome corruptive pencil
and NW 25 and NC 30 and then just use
some mascara and then I will be back for
the lips the models really had those
like peachy nude definitely nude Medich
lips so I'm first gonna blink then
completely out with my lip erase and
then the two lipstick I'm gonna use
playing coy from Mac I wanted to show
you some things how to make it even more
extreme like if you're going to a
session party or something just take
some Elizabeth Arden 8 hour cream I have
it in a really nice pot and if you
really want that model appearance just
take them out the eight hour cream and
use the shine of the cream on your
cheekbones so just dab it on
and that gives the nicest like hi model
sheen to the cheekbones it really gets
that like glowy wet feeling that all
those models always have a little bit on
a no it's not too much and a little bit
on the lip that is also beautiful for
summer so uh yeah that completes this
our runway inspired summer look like if
you're going to a fashion party or you
like smokey eyes and you have a date
like in a sultry summer evening so yeah
