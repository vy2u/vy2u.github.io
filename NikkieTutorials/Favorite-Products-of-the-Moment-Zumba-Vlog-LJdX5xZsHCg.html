on my first lesson of Zumba and just to
make this kind of appropriate for
nikkietutorials I'm gonna tell you my
favorite products of the month or
actually of the moment and I want to do
that every month and just do makeup with
it and stuff but for now I just tell you
what I love around two hours ago I had
my first lesson of Zumba and my
sister-in-law and her friend did it for
such a long time already and I really
want to lose weight again because I
gained some weight and stuff like that
and I just was done with it and I wanted
to be skinny again and I decided to do
Zumba oh my god it is so much fun it is
so much fun I absolutely was at first I
was like well I love to dance but not
like the music really makes you really
happy and then the teacher that we had
was so like uplifting and happy and some
nice and you really wanted to move you
know so you just you didn't want to like
it's like that when you work out but
with this he really wants to like him so
um I am doing Zumba and my favorite part
was to cool down yeah just kidding with
the cool that you lay down and all the
lies go out he can relax and do nothing
and then you have to stretch and stuff
favorite part really my favorite uh
dance moves
definitely word
we had to do with this like that and
then roll your hips with it and the
other side roll your hips with it and um
we did a slide and I felt like being in
a Gaga concert I loved it
seriously if you want to work out and
you want to lose weight and you want to
have fun while doing it
go to Zumba and seriously I think I lost
half of my body fluids okay so now for
favorite products of the moment um I
have one two three four five six seven
eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen I
need to cut something down so I'm going
to start up with the things I'm wearing
on my lips which include my Fit some
people ask me on what is their favorite
new lipstick it's not a lipstick it's
the Mac lip erase in pale and I got this
I've met pro can you see the dent I made
in it already it's held lip erase and it
gives me the perfect nude lip because it
just erases the color out of your lip
and once it is too much just take some
off and that and then and the lipstick I
applied the cream Sheen lip stick by Mac
in off the royalty and let me zoom and I
have a sit because I'm doing a new skin
routine so that's off oil tea and it's
an amazing baby pink color and it is
from Amex like with all the kiddies
collection and then on top to make it
just a little bit more fun I applied my
new favorite dads with last my Mac and
is love alert and on this camera it
looks red right now
but in real life it is um really cool
and it has pink glitter huggers then a
second thing I got is the new Sigma
facial Venetian runs hook kabuki brushes
um they have like the they had this one
out already - 197 that one I don't like
that one on myself but I like it on
clients but then they came up with two
others and this is the round top kabuki
this is the f82 and this is my new baby
I love this brush if you want easy quick
foundation application get the round top
kabuki brush from Sigma and the link is
below the next is when we're gonna do
this nail polish and this is or Alize
space
Ketut cut it I have no idea how to pan
out side but this is an amazing duo
chrome nail polish I posted pictures on
Twitter and I'm going to put those on my
website to nikkietutorials that comment
this is really cool in for my chin and
then the next thing is an eyeliner a
liquid eyeliner by Illamasqua and this
is from their art of darkness collection
and it is this is a liquid eyeliner
it's called abbess but it's black I
don't know what it is but it's black in
this one and it has a brush now here we
go
like this
with that brush liquid eyeliner
application is so easy and so quick and
beautiful but the best thing is is that
this liquid eyeliner is um waterproof
and it really is I have had so many like
liquid islands that said well we're
waterproof then the next two things are
two glitters and the first thing it's
the glitter that I used in my Maleficent
tutorial this is by makeup studio one of
my new favorite brands out there um well
it is new but I just discovered it this
is called pearl lilac and that's and if
you watch my Melissa tutorial my
Halloween one I use it right here and it
is so cool like the base is transparent
but the glitters through it are pearl
violet
/ lilac like if you put this on black
you have the coolest purple glittery
eyes ever and then this other glitter
that I really love are the Mac solar
bits - pearlized pigments
this is scatter rays and this is my new
love pure love
it is a pigment but not a finely milled
payment it are like little clusters and
when you break them up a bit with your
brush they turn into this glitter
pigment I love it it goes with
everything
almost and I love it and then my last
thing is really Dutch and I don't know
if you can get it in the States or
anywhere else but this it looks so ugly
I know this is corn flour lotion
I saw you might know is that since a
month ago I go to
a makeup school which is B Academy in
Amsterdam and my teacher Pascal she is
all about doing lips lips lips lips and
lips don't follow the natural color you
have to go around if you want a nice
photography lips they have to be sharp
as hell and with this this cornflour
lotion thing of me this will remove any
mistake you made in your life and what
this will do is it will erase fallout
under your eyes if you want your lip to
go look if you wanted to go look Oh
sharp sharp sharp sharp um if you want
that this will like it will do it for
you
I'll do it but sign out if you have
fallout and you want to take it off with
this it will take off your foundation as
well but this is amazing this is
cornflour cleansing lotion stuff and I
got it at a ttle in the Netherlands for
7 euros and 95 cents I hate it when they
do it just make it 8 euros idiot okay so
that are my favorite parts of or right
now at least the products that I love
using and that every morning when I
shove open my drawer okay now it's your
turn and now tell me what are your
favorite products of right now what are
you just like enjoying like orgasm
moments but I really want to know what
you guys love right now and I'm just
leave it in the conversation below and
um yeah my next video will be one Rouge
