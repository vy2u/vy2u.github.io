I've been dying to do for two days
I love watching favorites videos from
others lately and I'm like why don't I
do that more often today I'm gonna do a
favorites video and it's not a favorite
of the month I know that people do this
every month but I cannot do that
everyone because I feel like it's it's
it's like such a big pressure on me
Oh excited you have no idea number one
is the know polish that I'm wearing
right now and I'm gonna show you look
it's super duper pretty it is a it's
like a royal blue but it's like royal
blue I love it it's called power
dressing and despite siete I've been
obsessed with blue lately like royal
dark blues are heaven so this is power
dressing and it's from TSA and my mom
sells it in a webshop no this is not
because my mom sells it but I really do
love this color
but I am gonna put the link from my mom
sub site right here that's one
this type of is something blue royal
blue as well this is max marine ultra
chroma graphic pencil in marine
Hillstrom it's a again royal it's like
completely the same color as the nail
this is a swatch but I love with this is
this face front
um pigment called and it's blue again
shallow depth
I hate that word so much whenever I say
it in a tutorial I just spend three
hours saying it depths death debt depth
depth at this is the pigment it is
absolutely it's like blue uh nun fire
look how pretty that is
I love that my mom sells face front in a
rep shop as well but I also really
really love this new Mac pigment that I
got yesterday and it's already my
favorite because I love new things this
is called Mac naked deep dark pigment
it's like
take it but deep dark it's like a really
nice warm terracotta sort of brown I
love it it's just a really really nice
warm brown color
this is jewel effects in shine from
makeup studio now I have used this in so
many tutorials that I did what it is
it's sort of a silvery sort of glittery
it's not glitter but it does have really
nice reflects in it it's just a really
nice shimmering stem My glittering
pigment I love it it is silver it's
beautiful as a I catch a thingy on the
inner corners of your eyes this is so
that is makeup studio jewel effects and
shine my mom sells that as well and I
also really wanted to show you my new
boots a couple of weeks ago me
Ellensburg Sharon went to an TOFA and we
saw these boots at Sasha Sasha is like
this store this shoe store I don't know
if it's Dutch but it's called Sasha and
um they have these boots which I it's
like I love them but I love them to
death and they do that which I love
makes me feel like Santa and I also
wanted to share a movie The Strangers it
scared me for life like the movie is
with Liv Tyler and this other dude it's
such a good movie but it's so
scary the movie is about this couple um
and they kind of get attacked by three
idiots um I will put the trailer on the
info box but if you really want to be
scared you might want to watch it with
like your boyfriend or your girlfriend
or your or your your dog or your cat or
your kangaroo I don't know
don't watch this alone i watch it alone
and i'm scared like but the strangers
it's a really really really good horror
movie and also what i want to put out
there instead
not get a nose job some rumors have been
out there that I have been getting a
no-show and let's get it out of this
world right now because it's bugging me
to help what I got is I got new light I
got a light box right there and I got
this other thing right there that means
that the light is coming from two sides
in the beginning of my YouTube things I
had one light bulb right in front of me
point it at me
so that makes the shadows it all like
that I want to show you this um sometime
