so much for watching okay for me this is
like new month's new beginnings I had my
birthday yesterday I turned 21 yesterday
and it feels like a new beginning and I
know it's been slacking on YouTube a lot
lately and that brings me to a couple of
things I want to tell you before we
start number one I am trying to figure
out my best uploading days so I will
probably change of my uploading schedule
a little bit I don't know when yet it's
just for now I'm going to keep it on
Tuesday and Saturday and I need to do a
little bit of research for when is the
best time to upload so that all of you
can see it so the number one
announcement of this video is that I'm
going to change the uploading schedule I
don't know what to yet but it's getting
changed announcement number two is that
along with my birthday yesterday also
RuPaul's Drag Race started airing season
seven and I'm so excited I haven't seen
the new episode yet but I have announced
this on my blog before and I'm
announcing it here also I'm going to
upload one tutorial every week inspired
by my favorite look of the new episode
of RuPaul's Drag Race let's repeat that
so every week there's a new episode of
RuPaul's Drag Race Season seven and then
from each new episode every week I pick
my favorite and I recreate or create a
tutorial inspired by that look what I
would like you guys to do is if you
watch RuPaul's Drag Race and you want me
to recreate one of the looks from that
episode what I want you to do is comment
on my newest video which look you want
to see because there will be a tutorial
inspired or recreated by a look from the
episode every week till the finale I'm
literally so pumped for this one I'm
watching the new episode right after
this so if you have seen the new episode
already who do you want to see uses
hurry on this week let me know without
any further ado let's go on to my hit
alright so my first hit this month is my
benefit and I've already been a fan like
a huge fan of the hello flawless
foundation you guys know this you've
seen this before you've seen this a lot
of times of a channel but there's a new
addition to that love I've been
obsessing
over the benefits hello flawless setting
powder and this is what it looks like
and it's just a colored powder it
contains a little bit of coverage which
helps fighting back like the appearance
of zits pimples and evenness basically
this foundation and the powder go
hand-in-hand and it just gives your face
a flawless finish hello flawless no my
next favorite is by sugarpill and sugar
pail recently came out with new pigments
so I tried them all out and my absolute
favorite is Grand tiara this is silver
on crack it is so silver like I put this
on just I put the tiniest bit on on my
lid the other day and I was astounded I
was like oh em gee how is this so silver
sugarpill already has a pigment called a
tiara but this is Grand tiara so if you
thought tiara was the SH isn't it this
is the shiznit Hershey's mixer if you
love silver for on the eyes for like
sparkle at the inner corners like the
center of the lid this is yeah boy my
next favorite is by Mac and this is the
Cinderella eyeshadow quad when I first
heard there was a Cinderella Mac
collection coming out I I was excited
about it didn't really pay too much
attention to it and then out of nowhere
it launched online you know it was
excited it wasn't as exciting as like
seeing sin on Christmas but then it came
in the mail and the packaging is so
pretty it's like this periwinkle baby
blue but it has a pink purple duochrome
so if you holds it in won't let you see
pink and purple but then when you twist
and turn it it turns back into that
periwinkle blue and not only is the
packaging absolutely cute but the colors
inside rock the boat so the colors
inside are vapour floof Omega query
satin taupe and stroke of midnight and I
believe that all of these are permanent
and this one is limited edition so if
you did not get your hands on this
palette don't you worry
they got all these shades except for
this one in their permanent collection
so you can
just by him all year round other than
that it's a great neutrals palette I
absolutely love it I've been using it on
a daily basis it's been all over my face
this month and I really like it my next
hit is by Bobby Brown
Bob Libra I always becomes that I
pronounce Bobby Brown so weirdly and I'm
like what what am I doing wrong it and
this is the foundation stick um yeah a
lot of bus has been around these
products right here a lot of girls have
tried these em boys so the Bobby Brown
Foundation stick in porcelain number
zero is my match and I'm wearing it on
my face today I think it gives my face a
flawless finish and especially combined
with that grab it and especially
combined with that benefit powder it
just shines like no other I absolutely
love the combination and I've heard that
this is great for dry skin types and
lately I don't know what's going on with
my face I used to be oily as far but now
I'm just dry like the moisture has left
the pores say I've been using the Bobbi
Brown Foundation stick in number zero
for probably a month on absolutely love
it I love the coverage I love that it
stays on it makes me look flawless I
love it it's great it's great try it out
my next hit is a blush by Mac this is
peaches purchase it's nowhere near as
loved as luminoso but I can't include
Luminoso again maybe I could maybe I
could just include Luminoso by Milani
every month we're not going there but
another blush I've been loving this
month is Mac's peaches I was watching a
life tutorial at Lilly ghalichi she has
her own website where she does like
where she incites makeup artists and
they do her makeup and then it's like a
class and so Priscilla Ono who is Iggy
azalea's makeup artist she used peaches
blush on Olivia lychee and I was like
okay
Priscilla uses it I use it I have to use
it I don't use it yet but I have to use
it so the day after I just stroll down
to Mac and it was like give me peaches
now the next product you know I obsess
over you see it in almost every video I
deal but I ran out of it and because I
ran out of it I started appreciate
the love again because it was so normal
to me that I used this on a daily basis
and then I ran out of it and it didn't
have it anymore and I was like my life
is over I'm of course talking about my
Mac soft ochre Paint Pot y'all have seen
that Paint Pot go down and down with
each tutorial so finally I ran out of my
Paint Pot in soft ochre and I didn't
have any list and I had like three big
events to go to and I had no more paint
pots I don't know how I did it I think I
use lip pencil as a base which sucked
but it did the trick for a couple of
nights and then after a week soft ochre
and I reconnected reunited it's back in
my life it's the best primer for
eyeshadows ever it's soft ochre is my
religion a lipstick I've been absolutely
loving this month is a flash pot by Mac
you've seen this on my channel a couple
of times now it's just a very nice matte
nude color it looks a little bit dark
like this but on the lips it just
transforms into this really light satin
matte nude color like if you're as fair
as I am this is a great nude because it
actually takes out all the color and you
can put a gloss over top and that gloss
really comes to life it has been my
favorite go-to new lipstick this past
month and I love flash pot and someone
commented on my previous videos that
they're discontinuing flash pot if they
are discontinuing flash pot Mac if
you're watching if you're discontinuing
flash but I riots will happen a lip
gloss I've been absolutely obsessing
over is by NYX and this is the butter
gloss in fortune cookie I've been on
that real nude lip kick I've been like
new lips were my thing in the month of
February and along with fleshpot I wore
fortune cookie butter gloss by NYX and I
just love this gloss so much first of
all it smells like this I imagine heaven
smelling like this it's so sweet and and
you want to eat it and it's not only is
the scent amazing also the staying
powder and the coverage and I
just love this cloth it's been all over
my Instagram lately so if you want to
see it again check out my Instagram oh
my god did you see Madonna when she fell
off the stage I the world sit still I
thought she died I thought she at least
broke a hip or both and I was like that
woman is dead that concludes my hits for
the month of February and let's go on to
my oh god no oh yeah no my oh god oh
this month is by Josie Maran and this is
the 100% pure argan oil in light I got
this because I've been having this
really dry skin issues lately and oils
help dryness you would think and I don't
know if it is because it's the light
version that it's it sucks or whatsoever
it's just this oil doesn't do jack
it just makes your base slide now what
I'm looking for in an oil is for it to
hydrate my face make my face smooth and
subtle just perfect for foundation and
concealer and base application and this
is not it this does not do it so I've
tried it I've read reviews that said you
have to use this for at least two or
three weeks I did it didn't do anything
so in my opinion do not even bother
spending all your pennies on this right
here and that's it guys that concludes
my hits and a god knows for the month of
February what for your hits and God

prevent your concealer from creasing on
the last one I've gotten a couple of
comments telling me that it worked on
the first few days and then after that
it stopped working for some reason or
for some people it just didn't work at

new ways of preventing concealer from
creasing underneath the eyes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
