my February hits and a God knows and
February has been really really really
amazing because I have some great great
news so a couple of months ago I told
you about my brother my little brother
being really sick it looked very bad and
that's why I've been kind of missing in
action because he's been going to the
hospital and just a lot of things
happened but I have good news so I
haven't told you this but my little
brother had cancer and it had spread all
throughout his body and he's the loving
years old so that us up we we did
not see that coming at all he had a
little bump in his knee and we got it
checked out and it went from bad to
worse to worst we're not there yet but
he had a surviving chance of 10% so it
looked up but last week
he got another scan and all the cancer
that had spread throughout his body has
gone the only cancer that's still there
is still in his knee and it's
significantly less and that's it so it
was it was everywhere you guys it went
in his legs his stomach his neck
everywhere and now the doctors have
fought it back to his knee only and
whatever is left in his knee is super
super little and he's only halfway
through his chemo so we are so ecstatic
we are so excited I want to thank you so
much for all your prayers because it has
been a rough couple of weeks
so therefore February has been amazing
especially since last week since we got
the results and without any further ado
I just want you to know that I feel
great again and sorry for being missing
in action every now and then but I'm
back and I have some great favourites
for you so let's go
so the first favorite I want to start
off with is hair and I normally don't
really talk about my hair because I
don't really talk about my hair
I've always been this dry shampoo
texturizing spray hoarder but I never
found
owned the one like the what like the
best until I stumbled upon the Amika
the packaging kills you so this is the
Amika undone texture spray and I love
this so much because I like to spray it
into my hair and it gives it a really
nice texture and like grit and you can
really fluff it up and create that like
super edgy cool girl hair also when I
just wash my hair and it's super flat
and just lifeless I like using the
undone texture spray to really perk it
up and get that you know that lift back
in and then another one I really love
going in with is the Amika perk up dry
shampoo so I never really use them by
himself I think they're great as a combo
so I sprayed the perk up dry shampoo on
my roots and the undone texture spray
throughout the ends and just over all
and then I scrunch it all up and then it
looks lifted and volumous and just
perfect again and I love the packaging
the smell is so good so if you are
looking for a good texturising spray and
a good dry shampoo I highly recommend
you checking these up next up is the
Kevin O Quan medium sculpting powder I
got this with miss fame we went shopping
a couple of times and I've always been a
fan of NYX blush in taupe Illamasqua
eyeshadow in heroine but I felt like you
know after a couple of years of using
those products you kind of want to try
something new and I know people say when
it ain't broke no wait if it ain't broke
if it ain't broke why fix why fix it yes
so miss fame and I went shopping and
Curtis had to find a contour shade
perfectly enough for our transformation
video so he bought this and because he
bought it I was like I need to buy this
now because if it works out for the
transformation I will need it in my day
to day life so I also got it and it's
been one of the best contouring shades
for my fair skin tone ever
I love the pigmentation I love the
finish I love the powder it just I'm
wearing it as my contour today plus I've
been wearing it in so many videos to
contour with and in my opinion it's just
the ultimate contour shade for fair
people
like me I will say though it can get a
little bit pigmented so use a light hand
and as you know I love using it with my
morphe and 5:30 it's just the best
contouring brush in my opinion on this
planet so these two together are life
for brows I've been absolutely loving
this Tarte Amazonian clay waterproof
brow mousse in the color ash blonde and
it's super similar to the Anasazi
beverly hills dipbrow but I've used it
brow for so long now and I felt like it
was getting a little bit too harsh dip
brow is so intense and it just gives you
a brow whereas I feel like with this one
the brown was by Tarte is just a little
bit more light and feathery and light
weight and it just looks a little bit
less harsh that doesn't mean I've
stopped using my brow is I still use my
brow is to outline my brows but instead
of the dip brow I now use this to fill
my brows in and it's been so amazing I
also like the color a little bit more
better because I've turned into a warmer
blonde throughout the months so yeah
this is absolutely great it it lasts all
day long and I love it for my brows so I
wanted to share it another product by
Tarte I wanted to talk about last month
its and you know this I wanted to talk
about it but I wasn't sure if I was
allowed to talk about it now I'm allowed
because it's out the so fine micro
eyeliner by Tarte has been rocking my
eyeliner world this is the only eyeliner
that I used to extend my inner corners
for let's say doing this look or when
doing a drag look or just extending
inner corners it's just so good it's so
fine and precise and tiny to really get
up in those corners and extend them plus
the formula is hardcore enough to not go
bleeding on the inner corners because
the inner corners can get really moist
they can get wet they can get dirty and
especially for me today I did this
tutorial and my inner corner started
watering so much and I was so scared my
inner corner extension would just like
go to town look crazy put this out up
through my tears this held up through
the wetness so this is absolutely great
the tip is so precise so
you need to try it two brushes I've been
loving the first one is by zoeva this is
the 240 brush and I've been loving this
for to smudge up my lower lash line when
I first got it I was like that's a cool
brush to highlight my inner corners with
but then I tried it to really buff in
and smudge out my lower lashline and
it's so wonderful for that I really
recommend you getting this it's just so
precise and because I have smaller eyes
putting this on my lower lash line
really gets that define Minh it's word I
looked it up and it really just gives
you that precision yet still gives you
the ability to blend and just have a fun
time on your lower lash line so if
you're loving that brush but then this
one by tweezer Minh came in this is the
line glider and I think initially this
was created for like eyeliner or like a
winged liner but I really really liked
this for the lower lash line as well I
use it for my lower lash line today and
will you just look at how precise that
Brown is applied this will give you
precision like super super precision it
lays the color down beautifully but
still has the ability to blend and smoke
out and just reach all the nooks and
crannies and just a lower lash line
dream a setting spray I've been really
liking lately is my makeup forever this
is the mist and fix um I have a few that
I really really like one of my all-time
favorites is by Scandinavian another one
is green marble that is what drags too
used to really keep that face on but I
feel like the makeup forever is in
between green marble like super super
super hardcore
and Scandinavia which is really really
good yet not as hardcore and I feel like
the mist and fix is right in between it
holds your makeup on it transforms any
powder into skin and it just makes your
skin look beautiful luminous gorgeous
yet still maintaining that face all day
long two lipsticks
I've been absolutely loving and I don't
know if I talked about this yet and if I
have I'm just going to talk about it
again this comma right here kind of sexy
by Mac it
does things to me that I can see on
camera makes my insides quiver
it makes my belly warm it just does
stuff to me it's just that perfect warm
peachy nude that just looks flattering
on so many skin tones so I love using
this as a base and when I'm in the mood
for it it looks a little bit warm and
darker but when I want it to be like
super new like today I go over top with
melt sext sext mm-hmm so this is super
super light and when you mix the two you
get this warm light peachy new lip that
just looks bomb and I'm wearing it today
another favorite are the new hood of
beauty lip contours these are not out
yet but once they come out you
absolutely need to try these because
these have been one of the best lip
pencils I've ever tried in my life they
are creamy they are pigmented they go on
like a dream plus they last
SuperDuper long a fear of mine is that
when a lip pencil is so creamy and
pigmented I fear that it will move and
transition throughout the day but these
to put these are gorgeous all throughout
the day I use cheerleader in my previous
video on my Adele video there are so
many gorgeous colors and I really feel
like you will really like these I really
like these and I will feature them in a
lot of tutorials soon but go check them
out once they drop because they are drop
it like it's hot
they are hot drop it like it's hot last
but not least I want to talk about this
perfume this is pure poison by Dior and
I got this because my friend Joyce
really recommended it to me and ever
since I've gotten this I've been wearing
it every day now I hate doing like
perfume favorites because how the hell
you gonna describe a perfume but I've
tried it in the past and it seemed to
have worked so I'm going to try and come
up with a description for this this
smells like an exotic rare flower in a
distanced jungle I don't have a jungle
near me so it's distanced that makes you
Hatchin sexy and just when I wear this
Rick is like oh I don't know about you
but when your loved one says oh when
you're wearing a perfume you're know
you're doing it right really go check it
out if they have it in a store near you
so much it's so good so those were all
the product hits of the month I do
quickly want to mention that the walking
dead that hookup scene that we all know
who I'm talking about I've been waiting
for that hookup scene since forever
forever and I'm so glad that has
happened and the fact that this pair is
now holding hands is making me lose my
mind because I've been waiting for them
to hold hands and have sex forever so
I'm not going to talk about who it were
but if you are caught up on the walking
dead you know exactly what I'm talking
about and I am living so the moment has
come for me to introduce you to my
February
oh god no so let's go oh yeah no please
don't hate me but also for the month of
February I do not have an oh god no I do
have one product right I'm kind of iffy
about it's the Boscia charcoal poor
pudding and I tried this and it did
absolutely nothing for my face I
expected it to dry up and just clean my
pores and just suck all the dirt out of
my pores but it didn't really do
anything
it didn't really nourish it didn't
really dry out my skin it was just a
half-hour of nothing I don't hate it
enough to say that it's an oh god no I
just don't like it I just I don't get it
cuz it's doing nothing for me but the
news that we got about our little
brother a couple of weeks ago has just
made me such a happy camper and
I will not complain for the rest of this
month so that's it guys that concludes
my February hits and 'god knows i hope
