February hits and God knows and I'm
super excited because February is short
and it kind of puts pressure on you
because in like three days less in a
month you have to come up with favorites
can you guys believe that I'm turning 20
this Sunday and yes that's on the same
day as the Oscars and yes I'm totally
rooting for some movies and actress such
nectars I'm rooting for gravity I'm
rooting for 12 years of slave I am
rooting for Lupita Lupita young boy and
and I don't know what else is nominated
it so please let me know who are you
rooting for for the Oscars this Sunday I
have watched I think all the movies by
now except for American hustle Philomena
Nebraska I actually haven't seen a lot
of them but the ones I did see we're
really I haven't seen the wolf of Wall
Street either okay maybe I should just
shut up okay so February is to its end
and let's just get cracking and I will
show you my hits for this month I guess
the first thing I want to talk about is
my eyebrows actually they are way too
dark right now because I will talk about
that in a god--not in this video later
on because it's hard to do product and I
really didn't like it but my brows I've
not been wearing a whole lot of makeup
this month or lately at all because I
just work work work no time for makeup
and my brow hairs are invisible
they're so light they're so sparse and
then you can't see him so I had this
moment of clarity where I was like but
what is my mom dies they're a darker
color because I have hair now it's just
really invisible hair so why not make it
darker and make it visible so I ran
downstairs yell for my mom it was like
mom you're gonna paint my eyebrows right
now you're going to dye them you're
gonna you're going to make me look
fabulous mom we actually did it as I do
my eyebrows oh we made the outer part
darker the hairs and then towards the
center oh she went for a lighter color
so she put dark brown on the outer part
and brown on the front part and you
probably can't tell the difference
because I'm wearing a bitch load of
makeup right now but when I don't wear
makeup you can actually see my brows and
you can actually see that I have hair
above my eyeballs I'm over the moon with
this next thing is the Makeup Forever
aqua liner in black I got this in Paris
and I talked about it in my Paris haul I
feel loving this eyeliner I used to be a
gel liner kind of girl like like stat
like the only thing ever but I don't
know gel liners have been kind of
bugging me lately they dry out they just
are they don't work all the time and a
liquid eyeliner does and this is a great
one it's super well to prove it's super
resistant it stays on like a mofo what
Elsa talked about in my Paris haul is
this narcissist palette by NARS and I
heard that a lot of you hate this and I
really don't understand because it's an
awesome palette it comes with amazing
cool and warm tone neutrals that has
shimmers it has mattes and it's just an
amazing palette and I've done a full
blog post review on it on my blog so if
you want to see that review that blog
post review then go to nikkietutorials
comm which is my blog and I especially
like it because if you don't have a lot
of NARS eyeshadows yet and you really
want to sort of venture in and you want
to know more about their shadows this is
a great way to start because it comes
with 15 shadows and you can really sort
of taste
what noir shadows are like so that is
why I really love it because I only have
like one duo of NARS and a lot of
blushes but none of the eyeshadows so I
sort of a really good appetizer for more
NARS shadows the next thing I want to
talk about is a Mac pigment and I
actually own a lot of pigments I love
the Mac pigments but for some reason I
never tried copper sparkle this has been
getting quite a lot of attention on
YouTube lately I saw it at Lauren Curtis
I saw it at someone else but Lauren
Curtis was the one I saw using it this
morning in the video and I'm actually
wearing it as an eyeliner today and
actually wanted to get this because of
London Fashion Week be
there was a show where a MEK artist used
this as a top liner but also as a liner
in the crease and I love that look I
will probably recreate it for a tutorial
because it's amazing I love that look so
much so I kind of took inspiration from
that as well so I applied it as my
eyeliner today and I think it matches
great with the purple and everything but
this is copper Sparkle pigment by Mac
it's amazing it's super sparkly and
shiny and so so intense and I love this
pigment next is LM eskas brow and lash
gel and I actually got this about a week
ago and this at first I really had to
get used to it because it did not
understand how people could rave about
this I've always been a huge huge fan of
the makeup studio eyebrow fix gel the
gel that makeup studio makes but I ran
out of that and I wanted to try
something new because I love sort of
twisting up my products and trying out
new stuff so I ordered the LMS car brown
lash gel and I put it on and um because
the makeup studio one is kind of wet and
you can actually feel it sort of making
your brow hairs wet so when I put this
illamasqua one on it doesn't make your
eyebrows wet but it does set them in a
really nice natural way and they hold
really well but it doesn't make your
eyebrows wet so at first I was like
there's nothing on it's not working it's
not doing anything but in a pair said it
does actually do something so I'm
wearing it in my brows today to push the
hairs up and to make them look nice and
and bushy as far as my breasts could
ever look bushy another Illamasqua
product i've been loving this month is
the Illamasqua lipstick in lustre again
I did a full blog post review on this on
my blog I will put the link down below
in the infobox I compare this as the
twin sister but with a little bit more
cream and shine of Chanel's diva
so that's sold out like like a hot
potato so if you can't get that anymore
get this one this is a luster by
Illamasqua it's one of those super super
bright pinks with
cool almost purpley undertone it's so
bright I love it and yes a great
lipstick another nail polish I've been
loving is my cult nails and uh I'm
wearing it on my nails today and in my
last video and I got a lot of questions
about it
this is cold nails nail polish in nut
Kissel's shizzle I love this color so
much and the formula of this nail polish
is great as well because you only need
two super easy coats and it's just
pigmented it stays on really well also
because I've been wearing this for I
think four to five days now and I
actually have a little bit of chipping
on the other hand my work hand so but
other than that it's an amazing polish
and I really love cold nails it's an
amazing brand as you know I'm a huge fan
of prepping my hair giving it volume
giving it a little bit more hold and a
little bit more just like it gives you
it gives you the feeling as if you have
more hair so I'm a huge pepper fanatic
and I use a lot of products but recently
I found out about this British hair
volume foundation mousse and you just um
part your hair like that so layer by
layer by layer and you just scrunch this
in and then you blow-dry it it's amazing
it gives you body it gives you volume it
gives the feeling as if you have more
hair one of the best prepping mousses
ever ever hairspray I normally gravitate
towards my L net by L'Oreal the most but
I wanted something new because I'm kind
of getting sick of the smell I can't
stand that smell anymore so I wanted
something else and I quickly found my
solution in water clouds fixing
hairspray and this is for stronghold and
volume for all hair types this is the
best hair spray I have ever used in my
life the mist is really thin and it
almost feels as if like too little is
coming out of the little opener the
nozzle but the texture and the product
itself is so amazing because it just
holds so well every time I'm about to
hair spray my hair to sort of make these
two from parts stay in place and to sort
of tame
i OS and do sort of just make it look
good I can't wait just grab this and
dust this all over various but I think
out of all the products I'm talking
about today I'm most excited about this
hairspray oh I'm in a word and I got
this at John Barron's calm and last but
not least for my hits I'm gonna talk
about two things and it's all about the
same sort of stick a new season of
RuPaul's Drag Race started season six
and I've only seen one episode but is
already off to a great start
I'm looking out for Courtney acts of
course milk I think I'm gonna adore milk
I'm really excited for Bianca Del Rio I
really like laganja estranja as well so
i'm really excited about the season and
if you're a drag queen fan or you just
like RuPaul's Drag Race definitely go
check it out a new season has started
and that brings me to the last favorite
of this video that is RuPaul's new song
sissy that walk it's the song that the
queens now walk on on the runway when
they do their looks sissy that walk look
it up it's some Spotify it's on iTunes
and sissy that walk is the most sassy
fun song ever
so that's enough love spread for
February the month of love let's go
spread some hate oh yeah no soda first
oh god no for February is this mascara
by E Celeron and this is the bow still
volume is tech mascara and waterproof
and I always get my mascaras and
waterproof because my lashes are kind of
hard to work with ever since I use the
reveal eyelash they have gotten so much
longer and so much better but I still
need my waterproof mascara and this has
not helped me because it is what approve
oh don't get me wrong it's one proof
like no other but it does nothing for
the lashes it just adds a black color
and that's it it doesn't add volume it
doesn't at length separation nothing it
just adds color and you can brush it on
until you die it won't do anything like
nothing it will not do anything for you
it's no game girl no
last oh god no for this video is I'm not
too sure about it I have really high
expectations for this product and it
just didn't live up I'm talking about
the Illamasqua eyebrow cake in Mato i
was browsing through illamasqua shop and
as you know i'm a huge fan of their
products so when i saw that they had an
eyebrow cake i was like over the moon
and it took their lightest color and you
guys this is their lightest color and
the problem with this lightest color is
is that it's green it's green and it's
not light I do really like the
pigmentation and they can use it wet and
the sort of appliance of it but it just
doesn't work
so please Illamasqua you guys you know I
love you and I support you till the
guess but please make an eyebrow cake
that's not ashy that it's green and come
up with something so much lighter than
this and that's actually it for the
month of February so I'm looking forward
to my birthday on Sunday and I'm just
I'm ready for March I'm going to San
Francisco in March actually in about two
