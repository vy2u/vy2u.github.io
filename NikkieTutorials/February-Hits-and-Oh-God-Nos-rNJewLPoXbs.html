gonna say this but February I hate the
word February Fed said fed fab
I can't believe fab is almost over I
just can't quite grasp that idea of it
almost being over this month flew by and
maybe that is because this month only
had 28 days but of course I am here with
my hit's I know God knows and I'm
actually really excited because I have
some really fun things to show you guys
and um without any further ado let's go
oh yeah I'm so happy today
oh my god so the first thing I want to
talk about is somewhat of a well not
entirely but somewhat of a lifesaver
this is the road Oh Arctic eyedrops and
I got these a couple of months ago and
these are amazing because they kind of
have that cooling sensation to it so
they kind of something minty in it and
this will make your eye whites as white
as they can get around Valentine's Day I
got an eye infection this one right here
and it was red and and you and it was
just disgusting so I was kind of going
crazy because Valentine's Day was coming
up and I actually have a boyfriend now
so I kind of wanted to look my best and
I had this red eye so it was sort of
like the ultimate test for Rick to kind
of see my bad side so over the month of
feb 11 of hate relationship with the
lemony flutterby lush or any kind of
sort of cuticle my english today right
probably our borrowed arm so about last
week
my nails got really bad they all broke
off they all broke off no joke all of
them and my cuticles were insanely dry
and cracki cracky and just ugly so I
decided to bust out the lemony flutter
by lush again and um I put this on for
about a week every night before I went
to bed and it really made a difference
it really I can really see that my
cuticles are starting to look like the
cuticles on a nail blog but those are
like perfection and you can't really get
there unless you're like an eel blogger
which I'm not I think I gotta toss this
out in about a week or so because it's
getting old need a new one traumatic end
and then because my cuticles got better
I also wanted to add more nail polish to
my nails again so I have four favorite
nail polishes this month and my all-time
favorites are the berry and textured
nail polishes I'm wearing this one right
here right now and also in my previous
video and the video before that and this
is called really Road and these are
textured this is insanely cool it's like
you have this sort of like stone on your
nails it's like it dries in a really
gritty feeling finish but I love this
and they have four colors and they have
a they have this one they have the pink
which is also a favorite and then they
have a yellow and it's sort of baby blue
and also China Glaze came up with their
spring collection and there was this one
color that really stood out to me and
this is what's your name baby it's
mimosas before manis and this is sort of
that perfect sort of peachy coral color
and it has a gold shine in it I love
anything with gold in it I'm like a gold
I'm not a gold digger but I'm like a
gold seeker plus my mom is now selling
China Glaze
into her webshop hence Costa makes guys
dot NL so I took that out and I'm not
saying that because she carries this but
I actually really do love this and then
the last nail polish that I've been
obsessed with this month is by OPI and
this is lights of Emerald City and like
this you're like what the hell is going
on with that so this is of the the Oz
collection which um i was a little bit
disappointed by the collection but i
love life
shut it it's like square sort of square
white little glitters with opal glitters
in it and you can't really describe this
it's on my toes now going to show you my
toes because hearing YouTube we have
these purrs that like to see feet and
toes and when I get these comments like
can I see your toes or your freedom like
what happened in your youth like what
where did it go wrong then I go to eye
shadow product that I went to this month
is by Illamasqua and this is the powder
blusher duo in number three and yes this
is actually blush this is number three
and um we have beg this is called beg
and this is called bronze Ella and
bronze Ella is what I've been wearing on
my lids almost the entire month and then
a pigment I've been absolutely loving
this month is by sugarpill and this is
called Goldilocks and this is gold again
the gold seeker thing that I own in my
body
Simmi it's gold it's glittery it's it's
pigmented you can dust it on this sort
of like a glitter and shine but if you
really pack it on it's insane you can
use this on lips on eyebrows on your
body this is insane another favorite
this month is my NARS Valero lip Velvet
Matte lip pencil and I featured this in
last month uh hits I know God knows but
I cut it out because the video was
getting too long and I actually had it
in my hand on the thumbnail but I cut it
out of the video because it was getting
too long and then I wore this a couple
of times in videos and people actually
they obsessed over it
I wear this about a week or so and then
after a week I kind of went back to my
lip erase and pill by Mac also a huge
favorite and I kind of started missing
Bolero so I'm not cutting it up this
month this is nurse Velvet Matte lip
pencil in moliro and I love it okay then
the last sort of beauty thing as a
favorite I have for this month is the
fudge and I love this because I always
substitute for fudge dunno why but
I do and this is the clean blonde violet
toning shampoo now you guys all know I
love my blonde hair and I want to keep
it sort of like a Coolidge sort of ashy
color I have to get it downwind out
because I have like new girls like hell
and it's starting to become a piss color
again Thank You Willam your beat down it
looks like what was in my head I didn't
get it I'm Dutch
I used to snow and then to kind of tone
my hair and make it a little bit more
ashy and gray but again I gotta get my
hair done because it's kind of it's over
it's expiration date I love it okay then
the last favorite and I'm so happy that
I can actually show you this I started
losing weight about the beginning of
this year of 2013 and uhm so far I have
lost quite a lot of weight and I'm
actually really proud of myself so I
went shopping with two of my really good
friends so Shia Sharon and Sharon
actually has a YouTube channel called
looks by Sharon we went shopping and we
went to mango and the sort of like the
sister store of Zara
um and I saw this amazing sparkly
sequined dress and anything sparkly and
sequiny makes me go insane so I saw this
hanging there and I was like oh my gosh
that is perfection and Valentine's Day
was coming up and I wanted to look
really good
I kind of looked at it like I'm never
gonna fit into that and then I think it
was Sharon who told me like try it on
try it on you never know so I went to
the fitting room and I tried this on and
it fit me and I almost started crying in
the fitting room because this wonderful
piece of God fits me and it is so
freakin gorgeous
it's like sequin heaven it's like I died
and went to sequin heaven I love this I
still can't believe that I actually fit
into this and I put this on my Instagram
and I will put the picture right here
right now
um and I'm so proud of myself okay there
for favorite TV show up this month the
following this show is freakin insane
they have like threesomes they have like
this cults of killing people and they
have this big leader and will you shut
up again it's such an amazing show and I
can't really explain but it's like this
called that is like obsessed with this
murderer and you kind of when he tells
his cult
kill someone they do it and it's a
really good story favorite music this
month is by pink her album the truth
about love is absolutely amazing also I
want to kind of erase what I said last
month about Rihanna I started listening
to her album a little bit kind of
forcing myself to listen to it and I'm
actually kind of becoming a big fan of
the album now not everything but more
than last month then on to the oh god
knows of this month and I only have two
they're pretty bad oh yeah No so the
first oh god no this month is my Mac and
this is copy cleanse off oil and um I
got this I think like almost a year ago
now and I absolutely hate its guts and
look how much it's out of it I think
three pumps maybe six because I wear a
lot of makeup
I wouldn't even wash my toilet with it
it's just it doesn't work it just it
doesn't work and when you use it you're
you're going blind for four hours and
it's no Dan girl no the less oh god no
this month is by Inc by Jenna's Knutson
you must be Swedish and this is the
eyeshadow palette in dusty green um I
don't like the colors the eyeshadow
itself feels really soft and it looks
really pigmented once you have it on
your finger like that but then when you
put it on your hand
it kinda it's just like what are you
doing and the packaging is kind of cheap
and I bet that if I let this drop right
now I'm shattered to pieces so that is
actually if that are my Hinson oh god
knows of feds and um this was a really
good month it was a short month but it
was a good month with good product so
that's it thing is so much for watching
for a full list of every single product
mentioned in this video because some
website name tutorials comm you can
