this going out kind of type of natural
not really natural look but for me it is
and the fun thing about this book is
that you can adjust it to your personal
Vikings totally you don't have to use
pink you can use other colors I will
explain that in the video so if you want
to know how I got this then please keep
on watching
the first step is to take Clarins
eyeshadow in number 26 dusty rose and a
224 by Sigma and I'm taking that onto
the brush and this is going a little bit
above the crease you want to go into the
crease but go more upwards as well I'm
gonna just blend that along now I'm
gonna take next embark I think this
along with the vanilla and which is my
favorite color by Mac use it so much and
I'm gonna take it to 17 and get that
onto the brush as well and in those
knees I'm gonna take that 217 onto my so
I'm gonna take embark in the 217 my Mac
and get that onto the brush and this is
going to deepen up the crease even more
this time you really want to go into
decrease your real crease
so don't go above and then just wing it
out a bit here I'm just blending it
along until it looks pretty
now I'm taking a 252 and vanilla by Mack
favorite color and I'm gonna take that
and clean this up and make it nice and
sharp at the sides and then I'm gonna
take a 275 by Sigma and going vanilla
again and this is going to be the brow
highlight
and then I'm going to take a 239 by
Sigma and got vanilla again and this is
going on to the lid and here in the tear
ducts as well or the inner inner inner
inner parts of your eye
now you can reapply some of the dusty
rose and embark and all the colors to
intensify you in and make the blending
perfect and then I'm going to show you
how we are going to do the lower lid
we're going to tightline and make the
waterline black with this virgia
waterproof contour clubbing I pencil
just going to smudge that along with a
water line and I know you shouldn't pull
the skin back so far but I do it sorry
and squeeze
get a little bit of the product above
then I'm gonna pull this up and tight
like even better
hey I'm mark again with a pencil brush
like this this is from essence of beauty
and I'm going to smudge this along my
lower lash line now take some black this
is um sugar pill bulletproof love this
and so much that even more along the
lower lash line and I'll make a mix
between vanilla and silver white so
vanilla so right in the corner so to be
honest that wasn't hard at all right so
we're not making it any harder than it
already was so for the fun part for the
going out thing for this look I'm gonna
take gosh what approve eyeliner the
extreme art eyeliner in oh one this is
like a burgundy purple
you
you have that lying around it's time for
the fun part don't look up because you
will get a line of that eyeliner and it
won't go away your look is runed when
you look up right now I'm gonna take max
or reflex very pink amazing and the key
for this step is to take a really thin
angled brush so a really thin angled
brush and I'm dipping this into my Hello
Kitty reflex very pink from Mac and
while the eyeliners still wet you're
going to put this into the middle this
is so fun
this is seriously so Pat that into the
middle and you can see it already
oh my god this will make the most
amazing eyeliner look ever so just cut
it into the middle
and this is so much fun guy oh my god
you can do this with everything you can
take a black eyeliner and I don't know
put gold in the middle put green in the
middle Oh blue in the middle or the
burgundy with the pink like I have I am
in love with this it is so much fun to
play this up you can you can just do
anything as long as you have some reflex
glitter from Mac I really do recommend
those because they really stick into the
liner and glitters are too hard to
really stick in it
we can try it I tried it doesn't work
really well but try it so I'm gonna let
this dry a little bit more and then when
it's dry I'm gonna put some of those
reflex on top again just for a more
glitter then I will put on some mascara
the Rimmel sexy curves if you're
thinking why are you looking like this
it's because it's not try it and then
don't want to get that weird line so I'm
gonna do that all right now and then
I'll show you what is on my lips for the
lips it was really easy I just took some
concealer apply that to my lips and to
make the card is going on top really pop
and I'm the color I used is
Gaga that completes the look I love to
do this look just because he can um
really adjust it to your likings you can
instead of pink you can take on
transparent teal reflex to make it a
nice teal blue color
you're gonna take reflex blue you can
take pearl red um I love this I just
love love love this and you can play it
up and totally adjusted to what you like
and that's why I love this look so I
hope you try just look out if you do try
it out please make a video response and
I would love to see what you come up
with yeah so that is pretty much it I
hope you like this thank you guys for
