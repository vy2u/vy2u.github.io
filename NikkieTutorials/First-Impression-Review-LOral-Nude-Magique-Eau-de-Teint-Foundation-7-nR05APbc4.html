favorite first first impression review
video and it's gonna be on the l'oreal
nude magique Oda tan a weightless bear
perfection Freshfield foundation I've
seen this pop up on a couple of channels
recently and it just piqued my interest
and I wanted to try it out because it
looked pretty and it was stunning on all
the others so I was like I gotta try it
out so this is my very first first
impression review video I want to do
lots more I absolutely love watching
them so I think making them is going to
be a lot of fun as well um so yeah
without any further ado let's go right
on to the application part and then we
will see from there how I like it
so first going to take a little closer
look at what is on the packaging so the
L'Oreal Paris nude magique
oh the ten fresh feel foundation
weightless bear perfection with SPF 18
comes in this glass sheer see-through
bottle it has a nice matte finish to the
glass and the lid and the sort of
detailing comes in a chrome lilac
lavender color at the top of the lid we
find the color numbering and name and
then in the back we find a full sort of
how-to guide on how to use this LOL
describes this as a feather-light
foundation it feels light and fresh as
water it instantly fuses with the skin
blending seamlessly to leave a silky
second skin effect it has undetectable
coverage a silky soft touch and no
makeup feel it's non pore clogging SPF
eighteen buff everything that's on the
back I really like the packaging I love
that the glass has really nice matte
feel I love the color of the chrome
lavender purple so yeah
packaging wise it's absolutely great I
wouldn't want to drop it since it's
glass and I don't want everything to be
broken like a river so without any
further ado let's go ahead and test this
bad boy out I am first gonna pry my skin
it's not really priming it's more of a
sort of moisturizing base for that I'll
be using my Mac prep and prime natural
radiance in radiant yellow I use this
every single
a I use this with every makeup
application so I won't be using this
when using the l'oreal nude mushy Conda
you know on a normal basis really
okay so first I'm gonna shake it really
well because that is what the directions
tell me to do so shake it so good I am
going to unscrew the lid comes without a
pump zapping and I'll be applying this
with my makeup geek Foundation stippling
brush because it's my favorite and I'm
just gonna pour some onto the oh it's
very runny oh God and I can already tell
it is oh it is very runny and this is
going to be way too dark for me I am
normally a NC 15 by Mac this is by far
huh if I can show you without it running
down my arms this is by far not an NC 15
I hate it when foundations tell me that
they're porcelain but they're not so I'm
just going to dip my foundation brush in
and there we go
I'm going to start off with circular
motions just as I normally would apply
it off the bat it doesn't seem to be as
warm on my hand as it is on my face it
is a little bit more yellow than my
natural skin color but it's it's doable
it's not like oh my god
I can tell that this gives a silky
smooth finish it's very it glides it's
very soft and smooth and and silky
really I can tell that it does cling on
to dry parts of my face a little bit I
can tell so far okay so cover twice it
is really shocking me because I did not
expect this to have such a great
coverage because it is so thin and it
because it's so liquidy and running and
because it it's marketed more as a sort
of sheer sort of sheer sheer coverage
but I am really shocked at how good this
coverage is I actually really like that
okay so that is what my skin looks like
after applying the nude machine
I did you supply one layer did not build
up layers upon layers upon layers it
looks very natural but without going you
know su shear so what I always do when
trying out a new foundation is get my up
close mirror my little Marilyn up close
mirror and really look at what it's
doing to my face so I can tell that it
gives a beautiful smooth finish it
really glides onto the face it feels
very velvety and smooth one thing I'm
definitely noticing though is that it
clings on to dry parts in my face at
some parts it really clings on to the
skin and it kind of separates there and
it kind of looks a little bit patchy I
can definitely tell that right here
between my brows in fact the more I look
at it and the closer I go with my mirror
I can actually tell that it really
clings on to like dry your patches and
it kind of separates where it's not dry
but at parts where my skin isn't dry it
looks absolutely fantastic so I think
this foundation is going to be a little
bit better for people with a combination
to oily skin instead of us combination
to dry skin people so that is my initial
first review of this product for now I
am gonna finish off my face with some
concealer brows eyes lips the whole
magic then we go look back at the
finished look I will show you some
close-ups and from there we will go
throughout this entire day so I'll be
right back alright so I did the whole
shebang I applied brows eyes lips
everything and I also did a little bit
of additional concealing because I would
always do that with ever whatever
foundation I'm gonna wear that day so I
did notice that after applying some
concealer and a little bit of Chanel
powder that I do love to finish a whole
lot more I also noticed that after
concealing it took that sort of breakage
and cracking away a little bit so it
made it way more pretty and although to
finish is really velvety and smooth it
was a little bit too matte for my liking
so I added a little bit of additional
highlighter to my complexion and I
actually loved what that does to it in
the end so at first I wasn't so sure
because it was so mad and because it
really
on to those drier parts of my face but
after do you know bronzer and
highlighter and eyes and everything I
think it really ties in together and I
think it looks pretty damn good if I go
up close I can still see some of the
separation not all the concealer took
that away but for most of all I love the
coverage I love how soft and glide II
and glide II is that a word it looks
super natural although if it was a
little bit less matte it would look more
natural so so far it is doing very good
I was a little bit afraid of the
separation and sort of the clinging on
to drier parts but so far it looks
really good so it is a 3:40 p.m. right
now I'm a little bit of a late schedule
today and I'm gonna go ahead and sew
them a couple of videos right now and I
can tell you that under these lights my
makeup tends to sweat and break off
quite fast so um and then of course I'm
gonna have dinner which is gonna be
outside of the house and I'm gonna go do
some magic and then I will be back in a
couple of hours to show you how we're
going so I'm gonna go ahead and film
some other videos and do some other
magics and then we'll be back okay guys
it's now a little bit over 6 p.m. so
it's been about two and a half hours and
I gotta say that the longer this is on
your skin the nicer it becomes that
matte finish that I thought was a little
bit too matte is now gone that now has
been replaced with a little bit of my
natural oils coming out throughout the
hours and if I take my close-up mirror
again I definitely think that the
foundation looks a lot more natural and
radiant right now so I do think that
this is one of those foundations that
you know start of really unit like man
and then once day we're in they become
so gorgeous and beautiful I have a
little bit of a matte skin day I have a
few pimples here and there and I can
tell that this pimple right here is
showing through a little bit and around
my nose it's not starting to crease a
little bit it has started to move a
little bit into the fine lines around my
lips and sort of around the nose area
what
it's about but other than that I think
it looks way more natural and pretty
than it did when I first applied it but
so far I'm liking it okay so welcome to
the day after I just filmed a tutorial
on a Rihanna look but I just wanted to
come back and really tell you what I
think of the Loreal node machine first
of all I do want to put out there that I
think that this is more suited towards
the more oily skin people because I was
kind of having a dry skin day yesterday
my skin kind of fluctuates between dry
and oily and combination and so I kind
of noticed that because I was having
more of a dry skin day it really clings
on to dry parts in my face plus it kind
of separated at parts where I didn't
have a lot of moisture so that was kind
of early downside for me I do think
though that this wears beautifully it
might not start out that beautiful but
throughout the day it gets more and more
beautiful because your natural oils kind
of match in with the foundation making
it look more natural and more dewy I
think in total I wear this foundation
for about eight to nine hours and at the
very end before taking my makeup off I
noticed a little bit more separation on
my nose around my nose around my mouth
and my t-zone a little bit I do really
like how it was wearing but it's not the
longest lasting foundation I have ever
tried but the billion dollar question
will I get this again once I run out no
it has a beautiful coverage it smells
amazing it looks very pretty on the skin
after about two or three hours and it's
so natural
and pretty but it's a little bit too
powdery and dry for on my dry skin days
and I feel like on my oilier days it
breaks apart and separates too fast
I also wish it was a little bit more
long wearing and let's not forget when a
brand tells you that their lightest
color is porcelain B porcelain I would
put all the info on where to get this
and how much this retails for on my blog
NIC deterrence comm and other than that
