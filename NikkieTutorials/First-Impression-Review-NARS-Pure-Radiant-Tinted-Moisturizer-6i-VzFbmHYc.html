little closer look at the packaging so
the NARS pure radiant tinted moisturizer
come in nurses usual sort of met
rubberized packaging almost every
product in the NARS range has that
rubberized matte finish so this is no
other different i definitely like how
clean and stylish and edgy it looks
because you know the match rubberized
feeling is a little different and is a
little bit edgier than just a plain
shiny black the only con to that is that
it gets dirty so quick I mean if I put a
little dash of powder a foundation
powder or like an concealer over top its
stained it will not get off unless you
you know bust out the nail polish
remover the product comes out by opening
the lid and then you just have a squeezy
tube so this is going to be perfect for
if you're running out and you want to
get every last drop of this I'm going to
go ahead and look at what it all says on
the packaging so the first thing it says
is this is the NARS pure radiant tinted
moisturizer with an SPF of 30
that's good people looks good then over
at the back we find the color name this
is called a tentative light zero if I
butchered that tentative part then
excuse me so much directions for use
blend onto skin following daily skincare
routine for a sheer naturally glowing
finish then they repeat that in French
and I believe in a whole bunch of other
languages oh I see Dutch in there Eclair
does often bring in the chem the
moisturizer lasts for 18 months after
that you can toss it because it's
expired there is one point nine ounce in
this which equals fifty milliliters yeah
that's what the pattern tells me so yeah
I say why am I still talking let's go on
to the demo okay so what I'm going to be
doing is I'm gonna
I have my face with the moisturizer with
my hands with my fingers and then the
other half with a brush just to see what
works better the brush I'll be using is
by makeup geek and it's the foundation
stippling brush it's my absolute
favorite so um let's get onto it so
right off the bat I can tell that the
color looks really light and really good
for my skin tone I think it's going to
be a pretty damn good match and I love
that about north that their lightest
color light zero is actually a light
zero instead of like a light four so I'm
just going to take a bit and dot it on
my face so I place equal dots on both
sides of my face and now I'm going to
blend one part in with my fingers and
one with the brush I'm going to start
with my fingers smells lovely it has a
really fresh fruity scent summery scent
I should say okay I went on a vacation
to France and my forehead is a little
warmer and the rest of my face for one
god damn it
I'm personally not the biggest fan of
applying products facial products with
my fingers unless you know the product
is really made for it so I want to be
doing this on a day to day basis
normally but I just wanted to show you
what it looks like once you apply it
with your fingers and I can definitely
tell that the coverage is amazing for a
tinted moisturizer it definitely looks
covered okay so for the other half I'm
going to dab and tap and buff this in
using my makeup geek brush so this is
what the product looks like with just
all those dots blend it in once I
compare the to uncover twice it's pretty
much the same so it doesn't really
matter if you like using your hands or
if you like using a brush
I wouldn't recommend using this with a
Beauty Blender or just a sponge because
I think that would soak up waiting
of the actual product so um but yeah as
you can tell coverage is pretty much the
same on both sides so if you want to go
four fingers or brush it really doesn't
matter I am going to take out a little
bit more and apply it where I think I
need more coverage just to see how this
builds up I always get a little bit more
red on the tops of my cheekbones chin
and jawline so I'm just reapply a little
bit there and it's doing absolutely
great at that I love that this looks so
natural and like skin but it still takes
out the flaws now to truly test it i'm
going to take my Marilyn Monroe close-up
mirror and look really closely what it's
doing to my face so close up side it
definitely does not cake up it looks
like a really nice glowy skin finish
yeah it takes away redness of course not
all the redness because again it's a
tinted moisturizer but if you're someone
who has a great skin and you pop this on
you're you're good you're good to go you
don't have to do anything else about
your face it doesn't cling on to dry
parts of my face and the earlier parts
it just you know blends in right
perfectly so I'm pretty impressed with
this so I'm going to go ahead and apply
the rest of my makeup I'm going to apply
a little bit of concealer I'm going to
apply the Pro Longwear concealer just on
my eyes and I won't be doing any
additional highlighting with concealers
and stuff just underneath my eyes to
clear it up a bit and then it will be
Brooke boom Club so this is what the
tinted moisturizer looks like with all
my makeup on I added some additional
concealer underneath my eyes and on any
pimples that I have today and just you
know my Chanel powder and then my
eyebrows are streets of thing lips and
then once I've done all that this is
what comes out now I have to be honest
with you I think it looks absolutely
amazing because my skin
has that flawless finish now but it's
not cakey and it's not like cake face
and too much and too much you know
foundation on there and I like that some
of the pimples some of the redness still
shines through a little bit right here
if you can look right there you can see
one people two pimple and also here on
pimple but with a tinted moisturizer I'm
okay with that when I decide to wear a
tinted moisturizer I'm okay with letting
my flaws well not like you can't really
see him with this one but let him you
know letting them shine through a little
bit more just giving that more skin feel
instead of you know plastic fantastic so
it is almost 1 p.m. now here in Holland
and I have a full day of sitting we have
a pool in our backyard and one of my
best friends Joyce is coming over she
can actually drop in any sick and nuts
so Joyce is coming over and we're gonna
you know lounge around the pool and just
chill and we're probably gonna go
outside and you know do some light
shopping and it is really hot outside
right now I think it's about 28 Celsius
degrees right now so yeah so that is
sort of my day and then I'm going out
with my boyfriend for dinner um so I'm
gonna go you know around town and just
you know sweat a little so I can really
test this tinted moisturizer by NARS out
hey guys so I'm back and it's been three
and a half hours with the proofs so
Joyce and I did what we did some
swimming
and um we ran some errands and yeah just
getting ready she doesn't want to go on
camera without makeup well but once we
take a closer look at the actual
moisturizer I think it looks I think it
looks very good it still looks like skin
of course it has a little bit more oil
on the t-zone and it looks a little bit
more shiny here and there but I think it
looks good even Joyce told me that mom
looks like skin oh my god
and a dog very unusual even three and a
half hours in it still looks good in my
opinion of course it's a little bit more
shiny and a little bit up the spots came
through a little bit more as you know
right here of a few in here there a
little bit more intense now but it still
looks good and good Oh boobs Hey hi e
but just um uh uh why are you really
looking good from up close
hill yes really reflects our you sure
yes I'm sure okay looking at my charcoal
chisel um I will see you tomorrow
which you're gonna see in three seconds
for me it's tomorrow so welcome to the
day after this is actually a couple of
days after using the NARS pure radiant
tinted moisturizer but first of all I do
want to apologize for for myself right
now because I look I look absolutely
horrible I woke up this morning with the
worst allergies you can think of I mean
my eyes have never been so red it is
starting to clear up a little tablet
right now but it's still like red but I
did want to come here and tell you guys
my interview on the tinted moisturizer
and all that jazz so the NARS pure
radiant tinted moisturizer has
absolutely been amazing I think I felt
the review for this last week and I've
worn it every single day ever since and
I am in love what is so amazing about
this product is that it makes you look
super glowy and healthy from within um
and it just takes the flaws out of your
face so perfectly without covering too
much without losing that skin texture it
just it gives you that perfect skin
perfected texture it's absolutely
amazing I love how it starts out really
sheer but you can definitely build it up
a little bit
I love the smell of it I just thought
the look of it the only con and that's
just like the tiniest kana can have
about it is that it tends to you know
give me a little bit more shine
throughout the day it does not last like
a rock that's the only con I have about
it it doesn't last as long as as a
hardcore foundation would so for me the
north tinted moisturizer is an absolute
must it just makes your skin look
flawless if you have a little bit more
of a problem skin with a little bit more
breakouts I say you can wear this and
then perfect with concealer but you
personally maybe want to go for
something with a bit more coverage it's
just what you like so the billion dollar
question will I repurchase once I run
out absolutely so that's it guys I hope
