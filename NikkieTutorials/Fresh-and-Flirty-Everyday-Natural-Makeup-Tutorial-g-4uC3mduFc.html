tutorial on a look that I've been
wearing a lot on Instagram lately and I
also wear this look in my June hits and
God knows and in my nude magique L'Oreal
off first impression video I've been
wearing this look a lot recently don't
judge I really like this look because
it's it's natural but it still has that
pop a flirt with the eyeliner it's not
it's not really an eyeliner it gets the
hint of an eyeliner but it's not a
complete eyeliner and because I've
gotten so many requests under my Jun
hits and God knows comments and on
Instagram because I've been wearing it a
lot there as well um I decided to do a
tutorial on it for once it's not a
smokey eye without any further ado if
you want to know how to get this fresh
and flirty natural makeup look and
please give a lot okay as always the
first thing I'll be doing is applying a
primer / moisturizer and I am going for
my Mac radiant oh god I screwed up this
is my Mac prep and prime natural
radiance in radiant yellow okay once I
got that it's time for a foundation and
I am gonna go for a little bit more of a
natural looking base normally I'm just
slap on my L'Oreal True Match and and
one and that is a very beautiful
coverage it gives a very perfect
coverage I wanted to be a little bit
more you know sheer and a little bit
more transparent so for this we'll be
taking my Mac face and body in c1 and
just the tad bit of that L'Oreal True
Match so the the face of body gets a
little bit more coverage but it's not
like you know True Match level and then
just as usual I'm going to take my
makeup geek Foundation stippling brush
and I am going to work this in to my
face nothing new hair people nothing and
I love that this is a little bit more of
a sheer coverage but still it takes out
all the redness and all the flaws it's
just a little bit more natural
I've always loved face and body by Mac I
have no idea why I sort of you know stay
away from it
although I do use it on almost every
shoot I deal on on my models so the
whole trick is nowhere to be found
that's what's so amazing about face and
body is that once it sets it will stay
on like a okay now it's
time for the concealer and this will be
the part where I say just you know grab
your favorite concealer the concealer
that you love using most for me that is
the Mac Pro Longwear concealer in NC 15
and I'm going to mix that with my
L'Oreal Lumi magique a touch of light
highlighting pen in lights I'm just
going to make a combination of this and
apply that under my eyes and to the
highest point of my face to further
bring out my features and highlight and
applying that under my eyes and
especially here on that inner corner
because this tutorial is going to be all
about looking fresh and you know flirty
and healthy and when that inner corner
of your eye is dark you kind of look a
little bit tired trust me
experience speaking here
and that's time to put that all in I'm
going to do that with my Sigma f80 vi
still haven't found anything that works
better than this brush right here and
can you see how much more lift that
brings to my face I absolutely love
doing these sort of shaping with
highlighter because it just it brings
out your features in a really natural
way I love it
okay then I'm going to set that all
using my Chanel naturalist finish powder
in number 20 I'm gonna do my brows
off-camera and one eye so I'm just gonna
do that right now and then I'll be back
I already went ahead in a PI to base to
my eyelids and this is my favorite this
is Mac soft ochre Paint Pot now I'm
taking my trusty Saucebox etude pellit
and I'm going to be taking a little bit
of this color right here what I'm going
to do is with a big blending brush I'm
going to apply this into my crease and
mainly focusing on the middle of my
crease and then diffusing up you then
want to take the tiniest bit more and
gradually blend it to the sides a little
tiny bit but mainly keep it in the
middle and go up from that same palette
I've been taking this cream color and
with this you can really lift up that
brow bone by highlighting it and I also
like to really open up my inner corners
with this so I really pack it on in here
the same a date with the concealer that
spot right there and then blend out and
I love this trick because it instantly
makes you look wide awake and healthy
then too at the tiniest bit of warmth to
the crease I'm going to take Max
uninterupted eyeshadow and just really
lightly
warm up the crease with this a tiny tiny
bit for a little bit of glow on my inner
corners and live I'm going to take this
ombre Hypnose eyeshadow by Lancome and
this is called peach juice and this
shadow does have a bit of shimmer to it
but it mainly looks as if it's glowing
from within
this is one of my all-time favorite
shadows for a natural look to pop on the
lid in the inner corners because it has
a bit of sparkle and shine but it's not
too much plus the color just makes it
look as if it's glowing from within I
absolutely love this color and I'm also
popping this on the inner corners to
further open up my eyes and give me that
wide-awake feel okay then for that soft
touch of winged liner I'm going to take
the black eyeshadow from the etude
palette and this guy's is so easy to
take an angled brush and you just make a
line for a winged eyeliner and then once
you got that line you want to trace it
back to the lash line like this and then
weak that wing really nice and sharp
then fill this in with the same shadow
then you want to wipe the brush off and
then simply what you want to do is drag
the edges into the lash line and kind of
diffuse the top line to give it a little
bit more of a smoky and smudged in
feeling and that way you really get that
eyeliner feel but it's not too dramatic
and much I know my wing is a little bit
on the longer side but that's because I
love it to be a little bit more there
and dramatic but you can just get this
really short and flirty and no one would
notice that you're just wearing a tiny
bit of eyeliner instead of like a
full-on line it's really important to
curl your lashes now and give them a
good lift I am using my shoe and Mura
eyelash curlers for this
if fer mascara I'm using my holy grail
makeup Cydia would approve 3d in extra
black on my top lashes and on my lower
lashes I'll be using the Mac extended
play gigablack lash okay so for cheeks
with this look what I've been doing
recently it's just do my normal
sculpting and bronzing and warming up
being and glowing so that never changed
so I will be contouring my face today
using my been night
how to Rouge contour number one so this
is a blusher called contour number one
and it's designed to contour then with
my disobey bronzer by Illamasqua I'm
further going to warm up my complexion
just because summer is here and I just
with my pasty white milky skin I do want
that tad bit more of warmth but not much
and this gives me that then for blush
you're going to use another Ben Nye
product this is Ben Nyes powder Rouge
powder blush in vintage rose it is very
powdery though so whenever you dip your
brush in like the whole gunk load comes
off and I'm just going to you know brush
that on the apples of my cheeks and
blending back what I'm now going to do
is highlight my face and for that I'll
be using my Mac soft and gentle
mineralized skinfinish and mixing it
with a little bit of the other and
mixing it was a little bit of a
lightscapade and what I'll be doing is a
soft and gentle is going on the tops of
my cheekbones and on my nose and Cupid's
bow and then with lightscapade I'm gonna
sort of give my face that glow from
within look by placing it under my eyes
to a beach and my heart oh god I love it
I love these sort of understandably get
a touch of dramatic eyes with that
luminous flushed skin
oui oui okay so furl ifs my favorite
combo for these past few days
last week's has been the Bobby Brown lip
pencil in pale pinks I'm first gonna
give my look a little bit more fullness
with that
okay then for lipstick my favorite has
been the hourglass Sam nude sela
lipstick in number one nude number one
that was for my mom okay and then on top
I have been loving the color your smile
whitening lightening lip gloss in sugar
mama I am loving this color because it
has that really cool toned bubblegum
pink touch to it it really brings out
your the glow in your complexion and it
makes your teeth look a little bit wider
as well and it's just an amazing gloss
and it has the wood and that guy's
