video today is all about a challenge to
probably no I don't really have a
problem with showing my naked face on
the Internet I don't I don't really care
if people see me without makeup it used
to be really different a couple of years
ago I was really insecure and I had to
put like a ton of makeup on my face do
you even get out of the door to like to
get some bread to even eat - like
survive and throughout the years
throughout my youtube years I kind of
really appreciated my clean fresh face
and that is why I'm making this video I
want to dare you guys I wanna okay this
is what we're gonna do today I'm gonna
do a review on the new day makeup wipes
to remove your makeup with and I'm gonna
show these but I was like I'm gonna make
it a little bit more of a fun video than
just a review I want to make this video
kind of like a dare video so first I'm
gonna do the review on the new wipes
from demogroup and the new eye makeup
remover and then right after that I'm
going to talk about this giveaway slash
challenge because if you enter this
challenge
you might win something really fun that
I know a lot of you guys were asking for
and you like so I'm just gonna start
with the review right now and then we
will do well the fun stuff not that the
review isn't fun but yeah um David gup-d
makeup has new cotton wives and they
came out with the cotton fresh the taupe
the Cotton's fresh which is the blue
line and then they came out with the
cotton soft which is the peachy line the
cotton fresh ones are cotton wipes like
soaked with the freshness of a cleaning
lotion so that means that the cleaning
lotion really makes her face feel really
fresh I really
like a wide-awake david koepp didn't
really like only youth just stuff like
that just a tiny stuff of a cotton plant
no they used everything up the cotton
plant to make this to make great cotton
wipes or something that's what it says
on the back and it's really hard for me
to like translate it anyways instead of
like using particles of the plant the
cotton plant they use all the good stuff
of the cotton plant okay then the cotton
soft this one I actually really like for
removing makeup on my hand the cotton
soft is soaked with cleaning milk so
these are soaked with the cleaning
lotion like the blue stuff you always
use for your face and these aren't the
cleaning milk like the white stuff
you'll always use for your face I
applied a buttload of makeup to my face
just to make this challenge and review
kind of more fun so when I take it off
you can really see them taking it off
and afford the for the challenge so you
can see it I'm not afraid to take my
makeup off on the Internet
then they also have a new eye makeup
remover I makeup remover pads and these
are fine
they fight and these fight against dark
circles and puffiness under the eyes I
want you to put a camera in front of you
and just take some makeup wipes or
anything to take your makeup off with
and take your makeup off in front of the
camera and upload it as a video response
to this video right here and know this
is a makeup Channel and I know we all
love makeup but I want to show each and

we want and if we need to go grocery
shopping and we didn't put
