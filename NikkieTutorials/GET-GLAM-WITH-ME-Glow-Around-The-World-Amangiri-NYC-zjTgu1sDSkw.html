hi someone tell me how the gabbie show
made me famous
Gabi did a challenge inspired by Thomas
Hall Bert to recreate one of my makeup
tutorials step-by-step and her video
went viral and now the recreating or
following Blanks makeup tutorial has
become a trend and so many of you are
using me as your bling so thank you I
thank you for all the love thank you for
making me that much more aware of what I
should and shouldn't do in my tutorials
and I definitely want to do my take on
this and that will be the next video
going up on my channel and it's gonna be
it's gonna be a good one
trust me I literally just landed in
Amsterdam from New York City I am now in
my studio and all I want to do for
today's video is sit back relax get
really creative with makeup and talk to
you about my life I'm gonna take you
with me on my trips I did a little bit
of vlogging yeah I'm actually really
really excited to just sit down get glam
and show you everything that I have
experienced over the last couple of days
so you know grab your brushes grab your
makeup and let's go so before we do
anything major glam and major crazy I
think it's time to take care of the skin
like I said I just landed from a flight
from New York to Amsterdam and my skin
is ready for some lovin so I was
watching a Jackie ina video and I saw
her talking about the Olay Daly facials
and first of all when she talked about
it I was like what because she's got
beautiful stunning skin so anything she
recommends I'm like ha so she was
talking about these and basically this
is a beauty multitasker that does
everything for you so basically it's
like having a facial all-in-one it
cleanses the face from makeup it washes
away dirt and oils it tones the skin it
hydrates the skin and it exfoliates the
skin to give it a smooth service perfect
for makeup application so I went ahead
and bought these myself because I got
recommended by Jackie but then I also
got an email from Olay asking if I
wanted to team up with them we're just
having the best of both worlds I got
inspired by Miss ina
and then Olay themselves wanted to work
with me to bring this to your awareness
so here I am basically you look at these
they are dry cloth oh my god English oh
my god cloth cloth cloth what I like
about these is that these aren't amazing
for travel because when you're traveling
you can bring too many liquids as soon
as you wet this baby right here it
creates a lather a lather that let me
tell you a lather that feels like you're
in a spa I'll talk about my trips later
but I went to Utah I'm on Geary Los
Angeles New York City and now back home
and every time I got to my destination I
use one of these to really like prep my
face get me back to hello I'm alive so
how this works dry cloth we're gonna wet
this we're gonna wet this little cloth
right here and we're gonna massage it
into our hands and what this is going to
do is activate the lather wedding it
wedding it wedding it mm-hmm
and as you can see there's already some
lather forming in the cloth and now it's
time to go to town hello the scent of
this is heavenly it is like you're
getting pampered in a spa but you're
doing it yourself you know and this just
especially after traveling saves you so
much time and effort and especially
money because to get this effect usually
you have to go in with five products a
cleanser a toner exfoliator smooth
they're like a mask this does all of
that in one go for you okay let me do
one final rinse with the cloth and then
remove it from the face so now we are
ready for the cake up and the creativity
this retails for just by the way there's
retails for 749 and yeah I'll leave the
link down below where you can check it
out thank you Olay for partnering up
with me it means so much and this right
here is called shameless foundation by
Marc Jacobs yeah basically if you saw me
wearing makeup in
York City on Instagram or anywhere I was
wearing the shameless foundation by Marc
Jacobs so today I am using it on my
channel as well so let's just apply that
and work it in to the skin everyone
literally everyone is asking me about
the sponge a makeup artist gave it to me
as a gift
she gave it to me and told me it was a
certain brand and then when I looked for
extra sponges because this is my
favorite makeup sponge out there because
I wanted to order backups um I could
have find it like it literally looked
like the brand doesn't make these so I
don't know how she got her hands on this
so there's options maybe I should find a
brand to collab with and make it maybe I
should make it myself what we fun to
have my own brand though I know a lot of
people always comment under my videos oh
my god Nicki I can't wait for you to one
day have your own makeup brand and
create magic products and you know blow
us away although I love those comments
and they definitely inspire me I don't
know just be in the truth speaking the
truth hair I don't know if having a
makeup brand is for me I love creating
products I love coming with with colors
I love coming up with textures with a
makeup brand comes so many
responsibilities so much pressure to
always deliver sometimes when I don't
know what video to film I will feel so
much pressure to like perform I cannot
even imagine what that is like with your
own like a brand and what if a product
isn't liked by the people honestly do
not know if I would be able to like
survive that and I know that sounds
silly now but literally when I
disappoint people I feel like I'm such a
failure I feel like my life is over I
have so much anxiety I don't know if I
could handle that with a makeup brand I
want to know who've you have seen black
panther I know it just came out I'm
gonna see it probably tomorrow I I
cannot wait like I've been waiting for
this movie to come out for so long now
I saw the teasers I saw the trailers I
saw it all and literally
I can't wait to see this magic Miss
really quickly gonna do my brows off
camera because I cannot speak when do my
brows and I really want to talk to you
about what happened to the last couple
of days so I'll be right back alright
brows they're done and now let's move on
to you some crazy eyes so today I'm
gonna be playing with the brand new
juvie s plays palette this is the
festival and oh if you love yourself a
punch of color hello when you asked me
what my favorite eyeshadow is formula Y
is blending wise people intubation wise
richness wise juvies place so today I
wanted to create a look with this I'm
gonna be priming with the makeup
revolution conceal and defined full
coverage conceal and color concealer
putting this on the lid and then once I
have spread it out evenly I'm going to
Pat it in like Paige Louise makeup on
Instagram this is one of my favorite new
techniques of priming the eyes because
it will just and the magic trick behind
this is you don't set this with a face
powder no it sounds so unnatural but you
take a high coverage concealer and I
know Paige Louise is coming out with her
own base and then go straight in with
your shadow this is gonna get the most
pigmentation out of the shadow this is
gonna get the most color payoff the best
blending so not setting it with the face
powder I know when I first did it I was
like but but but but what I tried it and
I never went back like I'm in love with
this technique i'ma go in with this red
shade first called Yabba so as I'm
applying this hello hi let me take you
back to a couple of weeks ago to when I
got invited by Benefit Cosmetics to
flight to Amon Geary Utah let me tell
you when I got invited for this I was
like you nothing wrong with Utah it's
just not one of those places that you
think of when you think of like places
you always wanted to go in your life let
me tell you I was so wrong as soon as we
got to Utah I'm on Geary
I fell in love and it literally looked
like we landed upon a different planet
you know one of the things I will not
forget about that trip is the first
night we all came in at the sort of
welcoming party benefit went all right
ladies so we have three activities
planned for you tomorrow that you need
to sign up for so the first one they
talked about was going on a hike through
the canyons number two was oh my god
we're gonna ride ATVs and I was like a
sign me up I love racing I love cars I
love cars so much but then they were
like it's with a group and I was like no
I really wanted to you know drive solo
go crazy so I was like what's three
gonna bring us so for the third they
went okay peeps so for the third it's a
little bit more daring but nothing major
we're just gonna climb a couple of
stairs and then we're gonna reach a
beautiful bridge in between the canyons
and it's a perfect photo op you will
feel like a warrior we recommend this
one so basically everyone wanted to do
either the ATVs or the the bridge so the
following morning I believe we had to
get ready at tell me like 10 I woke up
super early and it was that Kenan what
photo-op let me take this moment grab my
balls and let me do this so I did a full
glam makeup I curled my hair
IDs my hair I put my outfit on I had
jewelry on my nails were painted and
snatched I was ready for this photo off
so then we get to the car and we see
backpacks and we're like okay that's
okay so I was excited I was a guest
hiking doing this and it was so much fun
and then we walk upon this mountain and
the tour guide goes all right ladies
this is your time to open that backpack
and let's get the gear out and I'm like
get the gear out and yes indeed there is
a helmet there's a harness and there's
like little Clippy things and I'm like
wait a minute before I realize it he is
demonstrating how we're going to climb
the mountain my entire group has already
went onto the mountain and they're
waiting on me and they're like okay
Nikki are you ready and then it hits me
and like climbing a mountain so I put my
foot on the first you know stair I'm
like the first little is it called a
ladder and then I have to put my foot
into a little crevice of the mountain
clomp my foot in there and then the
mountain sort of curves into your body
so you're hunched like this and then the
next tree it's a trade now left is on
top of that curve that's like sort of
curves into your body so basically what
you had to do is I get curved in and
then put your entire leg above your head
and I'm over there like okay I can get
my foot up there but then what how do I
actually get on top of the curve of the
mountain he goes you just pull yourself
up on the rope you want me to carry my
bodyweight and he's like yeah and as
soon as that hits me I'm like okay I
haven't been to the gym in like two
months if this is the first step of a
tall ass Mountain and I'm already
freaking out I don't even want to know
what's gonna happen on top I started
having a mental breakdown I start crying
and as I'm crying I don't know why I'm
crying I stand there for what felt like
an hour and I go you know what guys I
can't do it my lashes are wet the
eyeshadow that I spent an hour blending
on is now running down my face I can to
it and then we actually went on a
beautiful hike and I'm so glad that we
did the hike because the hike was so
much better than climbing a mountain and
what I learned from that day is to
always listen to your gut instinct if
your body and your soul tells you you're
not comfortable with it and you don't
want to do it don't do it that's what I
learned from that and cam cutting the
lid with that concealer again
I want to do a spotlight colorful
creative eye today and I'm trying to
come up with a sort of new shape taking
that shimmering white highlighter shade
and going right over top honey and with
the so I wanted thinnest it's sort of
like the center going down it's sort of
like an hourglass but more faded so here
it broadens again but on the center of
that lid it's very thin see it almost
makes the lid look what wait you know
what since we're playing here anyways I
just got these donessa my rakes
waterproof cushion colors in and this is
a neon orange and I really want to put a
small defined thin line at where the
creek like the folk crease meets the
color please don't let me down for a
lower lash line believe it or not I'm
gonna go in with the blue because I want
to be creative yes
so back to my Utah story so benefit flew
us in to reveal a brand new product and
all week they have been dropping hands
and they were like what could it be my
guess was a glittery lip gloss or like a
lip topper or something sparkly because
we were in space and we were stars but
then we found out that they were
releasing a new mascara
I will also be showcasing that later
today on my lower lashes because it is a
lower lashes mascara dream putting the
blue down and suddenly I am asking
myself why blue regretting all my life
decisions you know I feel like this is
another one of those looks that looks
like total trash until you put the
lashes on highlighting inner corners
always help to okay we are getting
somewhere let me put on lashes it may be
lightening okay so what happened was it
looked a little weird without a wing so
I added a wing and then I was like the
blue is to contrast see compared to like
what's going on top so I added a little
bit of purple and I add a little bit of
pink here that's basically all that ona
added yellow to that I changed a lot so
now for the bottom lashes I'm gonna go
in with the bad gal bang mascara by
benefit as I talked about and this is it
grabs every lash on that lower lash line
and it just coats it so nicely in one go
that it looks like you're wearing
falsies on your lower lashes it's
dramatic but I love dramatic see one go
it separates them so nicely yet it still
makes them thick and luscious and it
just makes it look like you're wearing a
strip of falsies on that lower lash line
I'm obsessed now let me go off camera
for a little try to get near this just
trying whoa
eyes are done so colorful so festive
before I start with my cheeks I do want
to let you know that you can save some
money on Jiu vias place by using
discount code Nicki at checkout and it
will save you 10% today I'm going to
bronze with this Marc Jacobs bronzer in
the color tantric and I got this on my
New York trip which I just came home
from I went to New York with Marc Jacobs
because
I was invited to go to New York Fashion
Week
I know literally close to nothing about
fashion I know what I like for my body
and I know I love jewelry Jewelry is my
everything I'm such a makeup person that
when I got the invite I was so scared
that I was gonna be like the odd man out
I hired a stylist because I was like I
cannot do this on my own so the stylist
I hired has worked a lot with cardi B
and her name is Ciara and she is she
helped me so much first of all she
dressed me for the first night in a
skin-tight dress and she put it on me
and I was like honey I can not live my
life like this she was like you know
what just step out try it and see what
people say and if you feel good enough I
know what to do and if you don't like it
at all we can always change it I I loved
it
I like I'm not gonna lie I loved it at
first I was so scared walking into the
room with all the influencers and all
the makeup artists that was like people
are gonna look like me like I'm crazy it
really gave my confidence a booth so us
here I thank you for saving my night and
then the following day was the Marc
Jacobs fashion show so Ciara made an
outfit for me and she wouldn't show me
until later that day so I could my
makeup very neutral this trip has been a
lot fashion wise yesterday a word skin
tight dress and then fake fur to cover
my insecurities and now I'm wearing this
crazy coat with Marc Jacobs trick pants
so this is this is pretty stylish right

hello welcome to my lab yeah ready for
the show so I definitely felt out of my
comfort zone because of the glasses and
because of like all of it but I felt
fashionable and fun and like I was a
part of the group so we got in the car
with all the influencers and we went to
the venue and what I did not get on
camera is that I bumped into bebe Rexha
who I filmed with and it was so amazing
seeing her again
I was sitting front row and I was all
the way towards the beginning of
where the models came up basically if
you ask me they all look like magical
little witch soldiers like they look
like they were ready for a battle but
they were like witches and their makeup
was so stunning they were all wearing
the shameless foundation the same when
I'm wearing today and it was just so
surreal that was such a huge moment for
me and I'm so happy that I got to bring
