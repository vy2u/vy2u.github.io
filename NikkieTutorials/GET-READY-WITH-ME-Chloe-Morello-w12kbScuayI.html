I just constant looking at all your
makeup Nicki let's just get started
shall we
I'm not surprised oh you tap it in
I don't know I've never used off to
Scheib are you are you a tapper no so
what what does that actually do so you
have to keep brushing it in until it
becomes tacky oh yeah okay and then once
it's knocking and oh no it's working
are you gonna start or I'm I have to go
over there to get myself in it I would
interrupt your foundation okay by the
time you finish Ryan will have built
another room oh you like him who you
trying to me Miranda
stop so we can you mean for porn
how are you so tough I'm not that fast
you just didn't stop for ages I'm just
very slow that's daunting
I love long IRA I like long every you
know how Shannon always says that so
intense it's so intense intense and
intense intense intense do we use the
same shade in this I wonder what her new
light long
no I'm fair neutral just like way light
are you though yeah but I like that
intense intense you say try an
Australian accent in tight say hi I'm
Nikki no from Australia
hey Australia hi my name is Nikki and I
am from Australia all sound exactly the
same you suck at accents try I could
have given me an A for effort though
HobNob you that's good that's good keep
it keep at it
wait homonym yep there's just yeah tell
it pretty first I'm gonna put some of
these matte shades on and then I'm gonna
put that on and then I'm gonna do it
nikkietutorials inspired look Oh God
do you know what that is then oh I put
the matte stuff through the crease and
then the sparkles on the lid is that it
well it's difficult I'm like that's
simple and it's applied with great
precision
oh and love and care keep going
I love these like soft fairy shades I'm
gonna snatch my nose
what does snatch mean I'll contour
mm-hmm that's something I never do
because I just look so bad I never did
it and then one day I was just playing a
little bit and I tried it with this
technique and I was like yeah then just
with a sponge
tapi lying blends in and it just you
can't even see it gives you define Minh
without going overboard also I I love
snapchat it's my new addiction it's like
the closest thing I will ever come to
being a daily vlogger I'm having such a
weird moment in my mind right now it's
just a couple of years ago I watched
Lauren and you get ready in a hotel room
in a video and it's like oh that is so
cool and look at us now I'm not in a
hotel room but still I'm in the actual
place where you get your do your videos
which is crazy it's so crazy that we
actually finally met know that it's
happening and that it actually happened
I feel like I'm inside the YouTube that
I was you're inside the screen no it's
so mind-blowing
you know I know a couple years ago it
was just watching that video thinking oh
man I want to be there I have always
loved your videos so it's really cool so
Chloe what is the best thing about you
to free you the friends that you make
like I met you and like I met heaps of
my friends on it so it's definitely the
friends that you make know the worst
thing about YouTube is probably like the
negativity that you get that I think
yeah unwarranted and like and I feel
like you always have to people always
say well you put your face on the
internet you should be like hey what you
shouldn't be an asshole
yeah that's what my it's like I'm okay
with putting
based on the internet I'm not okay with
you being a ass yeah you don't
have to be an awesome why do I have to
put up with people being assholes just
because I'm on the Internet exactly so
I'm applying makeup eek Barcelona Beach
in my crease I'm a crew is that makeup
geek this actually this is a palette by
selves 18 I showed this on my snapchat
yesterday this is the palette I did my
eyes with yesterday it's so much fun see
now in normal videos I would cut this
blending portion out after like 10
seconds I've been blending for like a
good half minute now
blending takes all the time but I feel
like you've got really good eyelids for
eyeshadow I love I just have a lot of
space yes and I feel like your crease is
really neat I got bullied for it what
yeah for having because my eye itself is
small but my crease portion is like you
have big eyes people who find anything
to bully people about so who are your
YouTube friends lines a friend cream on
the Kimmie
Sharon makeup artist Shannon I love
Shannon I love Shannon - she's so sweet
oops I have you been in focus little
sorry yeah it's a tough one this video
to stay in focus and do it that's such
an attractive face so what is the worst
experience you've ever had at a meet-up
I just find it difficult when people get
really emotional because I don't know
how to deal with that because I'm just
like a normal girl mm-hmm when people
actually come some kind of famous person
it makes me feel a bit awkward yeah I
get that like they're so sweet and so
nice mm-hmm but I just don't know what
to do I'm like are you okay
Jeannie DJ moment but like when people
are really cool and chill like they've
become my friends right
like I one of the girls that I met at
one of my meetups in Belgium a few years
ago I went and stayed in Belgium with
at her house last year we went to
Amsterdam together like hmm it's cool
when people are just chill and like
normal because yeah unlike themselves
because then exactly yeah like I feel I
had like a personal relationship with my
viewers which is a good thing what's
your favorite video that you've ever
filmed you've ever done I have this rule
where I do not upload anything I'm not
content with so anything that I film if
I feel like it looks like it does
not go up on my channel really yeah I'm
Way like that my favorite one ever
probably I love how you're studying me I
know I'm really fascinated I'm a big
diehard fan and Nikki you probably
should know a bit my favorite video I've
ever done is for Halloween and it's the
the dull one know the clown one the
clong I loved that one see that was the
first video where I ever made like such
a sick intro and went all in and it just
all turned out to be quite good and then
once the video was done I was like did I
just do this what are you gonna do for
Halloween is here
do you actually celebrate Halloween in
the Netherlands we we don't really
actually it's not that big
yeah it's not big enough trillion I wish
it was like I would love to have like a
Halloween party well you could well but
it's your favorite video you've ever
made
oh I liked the Kylie Jenner one that I
did where I use the pads on my face with
this oh I loved that that's one of my
favorites of yours probably just because
like I don't know I laughed at myself a
couple times and I like I like funny
videos is it worth it let me work in
Reverse it might make a nigga man
I've never seen someone apply lashes to
their own lashes in real life and it's
fascinating we kind of the same look
