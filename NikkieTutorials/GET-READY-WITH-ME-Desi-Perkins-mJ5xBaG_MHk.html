first time we've actually ever met face
to face we've got a collab before though
yeah back in the day actually so funny
does he talk so much about everything so
much everything
of course though I really don't
appreciate Nikki and I'll tell you guys
why and I'm sure you love her because of
this but as a youtuber myself she makes
me look bad all the time because she'll
be on snapchat like just as I must make
up look and then the night of she'll be
like just uploaded and I'm over here
like uploading a week after I film so I
just it makes me feel some type of way I
like want you to bake me Katie's jealous
are you jealous Katie that I'm being
baked by a Nicki okay great get out of
the studio how's your big looking mighty
fine
mighty I do agree you're a great Baker
thank you so who's one yeah I just
wanted to make the funny joke but it's
you so I tried the glam glow mask last
night and I literally had to text desi
bro how to take it off I can show you
she literally had to have some you have
to do it honestly how do you shake it
the glam comb at a glam glow mask off
and then this happened
hi how are you
nikki has a problem she loves to buy new
lighting every single week even though I
tell her that her lighting is phenomenal
I'm sure you guys know her Lighting's
phenomenal you see this glistening of
light here I'm buying that warm brown
when I probably do a warm brown smokey
eye because I've never done one before
people seem to love it on
other channels Jaclyn hill I see okay
yep we're warm I'm gonna go ahead and
put a light color on my literate II just
to start off I think oh what is the
best experience of being a guru last
weekend somebody gave me an avocado
which I really appreciated I was very
appreciative of that
my favorite moment ever traveling the
world and dude yeah when people start
crying you're like oh you don't realize
that you affect them right exactly
that much but you do I didn't really
like you don't realize how much you can
touch somebody until you meet them and
then it's like well that's my love
snapchat love get to know you what is
your most favorite video you've ever
made ever
you know makeup look regular makeup look
wise I really liked the yellow liner
with the black and the pink lips oh yeah
looks like really barbie-ish hmm
Halloween wise yeah I would say my
except I made a really big mistake so we
had done the intro so many times and it
was late and I said Nick Baker I think
instead of Rick Baker because you know
was inspired by Rick Baker mmm-hmm and
the worst part was in the he commented
on my video um he's like who's Kevin
Baker and I'd died what is your most
embarrassing YouTube moment my first
video ever I wasn't so like lighting
wise I mean it wasn't great but the most
embarrassing thing it's like how not
myself I was because I ain't no funny
how people say you change but it's
actually it's actually you right now I'm
like the most me I could ever be as
opposed to a couple years ago everybody
should change if you're not
changing than like what are you doing
experiences and life change you people
change you for the better it doesn't
always mean changes never doesn't always
mean worse right people say that all the
time like of course I've changed I'm a
grown-ass woman now it's your favorite
makeup product ever ever I feel like I
definitely need an eyebrow pencil on
some concealer and I'd be okay with life
okay but I can't I can't you know cuz if
I have maybe I've had some pomade
dipbrow mm-hmm
if I just had that that I could like
give myself a wing with it and I could
also use it for my brows I always get
hate for my how I pronounce it how do
you pronounce liquid liquid liquid
liquid lipstick lipstick liquid lipstick
liquid lipstick I don't get the eight
people I really I just don't
oh look at the glitter oh that looks
amazingly beautiful I love it I love it
I never see you in glitter really why
does it look so good
fact that you've already done your liner
kind of makes me a little bit nervous
yeah do you want to focus on my glitter
I feel like it needs to focus yeah
does he look up this show me yours I
don't have liner on yet this is unfair
I need to wait it looks fabulous here
we're gonna grab the brush that everyone
got because of desi you sort the brush
on everyone I always feel like I try to
do the desi face but I I don't know how
to do it we've started it I got this new
brush right here it's by Morpheus the m5
28 it's my absolute new favorite
contouring brush because you just need a
little bit of your powder and then you
actually go in and contour it just lays
it down for you so you're saying I need
the brush pretty much last night when we
were gonna have dinner I thought that
you were on your way oh and I saw your
nose highlight and you were like does he
has a beacon of light at the tip of her
nose and so I needed it to so as dezzy

lashes on I just want you guys to know

together in LA living your life living
the dream and good lighting in good
lighting the lighting has been doing it
for me

of you thank you so proud of you you so
much for pulling through you did not
give up I didn't give up even though my
liner trying me did not even give up I
