so I think my favorite not gonna lie
desi is she's a really good friend of
mine and I just because I know her so
well I kind of feel like I'm there in
the studio I've heard like a lot of
people um a lot of people here they love
makeup uh-huh so they meet a lot of the
bloggers and they're like oh the other
great but like that in percent of
personalities not like that or whatever
okay so I've heard like a few people you
know they've met is like you see them on
Instagram and they're not the same
person right so I know you personally
and I think it's amazing that you are
exactly who you are whoa Mara
you know I've been doing this for such a
long time now what gets uh like seven
eight years yeah yeah yeah yeah
twenty-one what you guys like an
accusation soon right no you're 21 you
look ten News not playing all yeah it's
all right so how did your Instagram
become so big because it's one of the
biggest thank you um do you know what
honestly um this is gonna sound really
weird but I feel like it was like karma
jolly actually does manage our Instagram
account so uh huh so at first it was
like we kind of you know we're trying to
become more of a platform like even on
our blog we want to feature like a lot
of more bloggers and which I love you
know I just feel like it's so hard to
get out there because you know so funny
I remember the first time somebody
featured my work and it like I remember
waking up and really what he'll happily
get so many followers oh and literally
made my whole entire day like I thought
like instafamous I was so excited for
the Valentine are you work are you or am
I only so slow you're not your eye color
is so pretty
they're like so blue no there's so blue
green yellow blue green I never know
what it is so what is for you the worst
part about Instagram the vlog do you
know what's so funny is the worst thing
I it's probably not read even expect I
don't like how people like don't really
get to know you that well on your
program they really don't know you know
and that's what kind of bothers me I
feel like people just think like you're
like you know in your own world maybe
you you love yourself so yeah yeah
that's the thing I don't really like I
don't like that people are I think is a
disconnect that's what I personally love
snapchat so much I totally agree because
they see the way you are and they see
your life and that there's so much more
than just a pretty picture my husband
actually goes nearly sees other lashes
he's like a loser I love that honey
I know when someone on TV is really
badly contoured he's like that contour
sucks I'm like ha ha ha my bad yeah my
husband knows like if there's a good guy
lashes or back there he knows wow yeah
we're we're winning that are you at
eyeliner Z we're both the same cake
sorta I'm literally like creeping on the
demon to do now my god

boring so now she film now she edits she
sleeps ha ha ha ha now she flies to
Dubai

and then lashes yeah just be a little
bit just to get rid of the shadow right
but you don't curl them no my lashes are
curled

the room service a tip I was like I

supposed to give him I was like eh you
