did you start getting into makeup always
honestly I was like 12 years old
everyone else was like playing football
and I was stealing my mom's makeup and
I'm wearing it to school your first
memory of makeup yes my mom is huge
makeup case and I would go through and
she was at work and I would steal it
unless I wore red I shot up a school

we're gonna go bold from the beginning
yeah and the principal called my mom
like your son's when he makeup and she's
like okay well yeah straight A's
