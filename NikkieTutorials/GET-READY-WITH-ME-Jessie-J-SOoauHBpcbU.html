noise so when you do your makeup for all
these like event yeah what is like
psyche seeing you like think of well
every event is different me doing my
makeup for TV is very different to me
doing my makeup if I was going to an
event and I was going to meet people on
TV you always look paler and you always
look shinier models use more powder and
I thought I took more bottom lash on and
maybe do a white inside liner on my eyes
but when I meet people I often wear a
lot less that's if I'm going to do today
and I want to meet you all you're gonna
do well not less but just fly with me
come on yeah I like to do it all over my
lid Oh hygienic did you hear the primer
it's nice from living on the edge bed
I'm on the out here not using a pry -
changing I can who my mother book of a
little payoff to him girl under
hairdressing - the ghost of this one one
time I was do I was um invited to this
like interview on TV and they got us a
hotel room me and my boyfriend on my
board here in films me at home I know it
sounds really bad I know I know
so we brought the camera we brought lice
and we only checked into that hotel for
like a couple hours and we won't be

your favorite makeup look you've ever
done I went there I got myself as I did
a total my show mm-hmm wait you do out
there make up other people I did March
it's a wedding
well I for one think you are the one
that created the trend with the
Rhinestone in the center of the lower
lashline back in the day I remember
doing that with eyelash glue and going
on stage and sweat any eyelash glue into
my eyes so I can see the look of you at
first I mean the first I think it's like
anything you've evolved when you grow
and you change and I think makeups a
perfect way to really like to see that
like in photographs you look back on
though oh my god what was I thinking but
at the time yeah you know you loved it
and it worked and it made sense so I try
not to be angry at myself of anything
that I do okay I have a really hard
question yeah what song are you the
proudest of yeah I think it's the ones
that stood the test of time and I still
meet people now that have to have
listened to the Scott songs or
discovered them and it's helping them
now yeah so like who you are who's
laughing now nobody's perfect
I love movies yeah they're the songs
that I feel like people still now come
to me and say roughly that's my favorite
music video you've ever done I love that
music videos ah when you busted out in
that blonde wig and you like with those
things things behind you I died
um was that with the latter form no oh
yeah was that Wyatt today what literally
about half an hour into that shot I sat
on one of those pilot Palestine boxes
thinking it was solid and fell straight
for it and like pulled a muscle in my
arm and then you feel that a little or
you know I'm gone nasty not at all I did
well in Gulu this is lovely this what up
this is makeup throws off the starlit
powder Thank You a one have you ever
used 13 as a highlight oh that's like
bang bang onto my third and hola walnut
what is the moment that happened to you
in your career that really stayed with
you that little ones tell me like going
to places that I was going before I was
famous and before was fun where people

AHA so hatrocks to lead your face yes it
was very huh I was done when you do red
carpets because both are like how do you
make your long-lasting red carpet make a
bizarre red my backup crop it is hard
just because there's so many different
cameras and so many different lights on
even colors awesome one of the wreckage
I try and when there
like the more naturally you look the
better yeah because you can both camera
play garelu so if you look a little bit
Kate they're going to see it I did one
record once and I never did it again I
like felt so beautiful and then I saw
this wrong and I was like yeah no I
don't any one time yeah I know I've been
there babe trust me like the Brit Awards
I did a line lip clip a few years ago I
think I remembered that I tried to
personally block it out of my memory in
an iPod when baby from home on my mouth
and literally I am I remember in the
room I looked fine yeah and we took a
photo it was finding it on camera and I
couldn't smile - my teeth were so yellow
as I so the victors I'm just like I was
awful you know instead of blowing you
can do this so not gentle of course it's
gonna make a song out of it Oh singing

do you hurting my back you thing you've
got the strongest Sobrato
second me thing right like a sheep not
your question yeah um do you ever want
to bring out your eye makeup man yes I
know I would do it because I loved
creating my my own colors and we yeah
you know texture and formula I would
love that
I want everyone to like it so then I
feel like when people don't like it I
will like crush and like time so maybe
not it's not literally impossible to do
any
the N Roma life do you know that one in
those hard for me to like accept when I
started my channel when I just started
doing it you know people were so
positive and they liked what I did and
then as you got bigger yes everyone
starts getting a little bit more
negative and it was so hard for me to
deal with that because I was used to
like love and warmth and support and
then I have like this cold meanings like
calling you names are not loving your
work and it was really hard for me to
accept that okay you always have think
about this who would you rather be you
or them Oh me look past the pain that
they're trying to you know give and
think about why they're doing it just
keep on your path of light and promote
in what you believe in and being that
warmth and love in person you know it's
like if you keep feeding if you keep
feeding the beast it's going to come
