here with you guys have been asking for
us to do a video together for the
longest time
and you saw our crazy adventures on
snapchat and I hope you're ready for

over here honest because it's Kim Chi
she is one of my closest best friends I
couldn't live my life without her that
is no lie I will you so much okay well I
really so Kim is really tiny I am really
tall so when we walk the street together
we look ridiculous but we know that if
you're under four eleven you can get a
handicap sign but let's go lucked out
we I missed it by 2 feet oh god damn it
so without any further ado we're gonna
get ready
alright so Kim poppy Milani make it last
sprint came for some fun to watch on me

we not mind the planet on my change

and they only gave you one piece of
pepperoni here so I'm going in with this
make it last by Milani oh my god the
best thing in the world and it's season

nose on all day long and to keep the
oils at bay I'm going to be using the
Becca ever Matt last ever forever
whatever
Bob the Bob looks like the Food Network
on your hand
you couldn't oh my god welcome to
ceramics class you guys should we tell
our friends what we're doing today and
I'm super excited about it
poem we're going to Amsterdam and we're
going to the Anne Frank House you know I
did a project on her in fourth grade
mm-hmm
I told you that right huh get I'm
obsessed so like it's so cool that we're
going to get to see like the actual book
you guys Kim came here she slept all
throughout the first day wait the first
day was okay because I was jet-lagged
yeah but still we 79 hours
I mean I saw you died at one point
recognized how the hand like under her
nose to feel good I love the shape tape
don't you know it's the best I don't
know how any brand is going to top that
this year I don't think they can I think
we should tell people how we live once I
and I was like super bored so I went to
the strip club downtown and there was
just more like at the strip club and
there was just this like person just
dancing up and down the pole and all I
could see was their highlight it was
rigged like that so once upon a time
there was an Instagram feed that was BOM
Kim Chi no it was campaign win movement
and a silent and irrelevant like mask
for my son I want to pull up a patch of
star in this video I'm going to try the
super powder Tiffany cuz I'm just like
Captain Obvious but only when he just
acts only in certain areas oh man wins
but only here though is that wait at the
earliest years Allah knows oh god yeah
feeling set for like this one random
evening I was going through Instagram
and I saw this like popping a speed and
this girl who just edited her photos so
to perfection and of course I wanted to
know how she did that so I started I
like that about you
what oh you're like always so eager to
learn until then I started following Kim
cuz it was Kim who I was talking about
don't worry cuz I had just started
youtube right like I had just like
posted two videos so throat it was like
I was I thought you were like a fake
account and I asked her how she like
what products products I asked she used
to do her photos and we just started
bonding out of nowhere and then you came
to California at like business yeah
terms and then can't believe it's a
notary
even longer I think we've been
my pillows over a year summer oh yeah I
remember going to I think it was Ulta
Kim like her strong brow no you guys
never like to chose on my face but then
Kim was really confident about those
brows and then we were at Ulta and we
walked over to anasazi Beverly Hills
this is a Carrie what dipbrow would you
recommend and I recommended a color and
then Kim goes yeah but I'm just at a
really good place with my brows right
now and I drew it like you literally
were just like yeah cuz we weren't close
enough yet for her to be like you ugly
she's gonna set I'm gonna do brows real
quick off camera alright and I'm done
easy squeazy lemon wait we love you was
teasing juicing oh I'm Steven pitiless
pretty vagina but you g issue up wait
you're doing blush me no I'm getting
kinda brown way but you're doing face
Berg yeah I like your face first because
then I do that spray thing she's like
really really natural and a spring clamp
we're good we can we talk about the
McDonald's we went to the other day okay
so we picked up Kim from the airport at
6 a.m. 6 a.m. I did not sleep and we
were hungry so we went to McDonald's for
breakfast there I've seen never
McDonald's recipe never knew that I
never knew a McDonald's might make you
like with other things but their
breakfast is like a wonder breakfast is
so good however I was really confused
why I didn't get syrup with my pancakes
you had this time off is that how you
guys do it here I mean I guess and the
first thing she says when we walk in is
it's so clean you guys it was so clean
like I swear there was not one piece of
dust on the floor ceiling anywhere we
don't know flatten see what resonates
yeah honey work that content baby cut me
in half
so I want to do a look inspired by Miss
hi right next to me because camera
always has the ability to do very soft
looks but they're effective you know
what I mean
you do soft looks with like intricate
little steps and they make such an
impact but it's like feel soft and
beautiful and it's like one of my
favorite thing so I'm lazy another
budget for today's look I'm going to go
into this more c25 cipher Hallett and
have a nice this without so quick my
dream I'm soaked I seek you I will know
you no matter how far you are I love
that you can pop any color on your lid
and it looks so good because you can see
my lid in the end okay it's time for my
favorite pad or if you gonna highlight
okay you guys doesn't know something Kim
was the one we just still crazy
she was the wild case okay remember how
on our first time together we were like
at the beach and I taken that highlight
shot we were taking makeup shots and I
looked at her photos of us how do you
find like that
she's like oh you just apply highlighter
and I was like that anyway I am second
shirt that you asked me I remember you
asked me in bed and I was like and then
I was like nikkietutorials eyes can be
had I thought girl my highway wasn't
popping like yours in photo so obviously
I was doing something wrong and then
until the second trip you actually took
a brush highlighted my face to the gods
and it's been logical ever since do you
take the pills are lard
rat the glow on the tree below if you
were doing this look that I'm doing
right now what would be your next step I
would plant a dark suit on the glow I
would put um a darker color in this
outer D you know it's about to get a
nose job what yeah
no stoppin the tradition in my household
is every girl has a nose job like I
choose to serve him and my mom or my
brother but he's irrelevant before an
every girl has a nose job and like they
wanted to like literally lift this part
so I would have like a higher bridge and
literally it was about to happen when I
turned like 21 or something I go and
then I discovered makeup and I started
contouring and I was like mom it's not
happening anymore on you wet yourself so
what are you doing for eyes today I'm
going to do a halo with glitter in the
middle and some big lashes you try this
is the new elf mad format - such an
amazing palette it is really good I
ordered it do my makeup yeah look we're
so grateful to have found each other not
to get like mushy gushy nobody honestly
you are such a positive person
you're positive like have him around you
or Faison Kim and you will leave with a
smile you bring out such positive energy
and I think in transitive you're like
inspiring no but like in such a no you
know what I loved most what was when we
met like I was literally at like I mean
I just started out so I'm like you know
like negative 5 followers I guess that's
up and you didn't treat me any
differently
why would I I was like the peace museum
in excitement if you go a little bit of
this color
no but like video I'm saying researchers
everyone expects like really big
youtubers to only hang out with the user
and you let his you like didn't
care and I loved it and we became like
really close friends well I feel like I
was always like why would she want to be
friends with me and it was job seriously
though well like yeah now we like
literally sleep on each other but we do
well and we know there is so much drama
in this community and when I'm with you
as like a fresh because we're genuine a
friend
are you never breathing on my lashes I
didn't breathe through my makeup and
gentlemen oh my god oh my god I love

your last video have you tried it

perfection in just a minute
hi oh my god do you think it looks good
on camera but wait till you see it in
real life weather makes me happy y'all
where did you start off with makeup well
in seventh grade mm-hmm I was always
into makeup and never knew how to do it
right and my second oldest sister who is
in Vietnam she was a makeup artist at
the time right she did like weddings and
stuff so when I had visited her before
8th grade first thing she did was
introduced me to lashes and it started
from there and then YouTube how was like
popping at the time mmm so Michelle Phan
right was like my biggest inspiration
and she was Vietnamese I was like eating
holy like right obviously it's
gonna be super relatable Idol um which
is down here now because we're like
friends and we talk as unless was
surreal it's like really really weird
um she's complete humble I love that
about her and real like she'll melt
around in high school I never went to
prom or homecoming because I did
everyone's makeup so I charge like ten
dollars a face and make like a hundred
dollars a day makeup wasn't really in my
world when College started because I
wanted to make my family happy by being
in the medical field and right and then
few years ago it's like mom like I'm not
happy right now
how'd you respond she's very supportive
but yeah I came through the
communications and then started
Instagram and carry on I think education
is very very important yeah you're pro
education and very very into that
is so small it was a little technical oh

Grinch
