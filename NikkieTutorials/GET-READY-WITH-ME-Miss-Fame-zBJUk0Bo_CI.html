don't know Who am I please welcome to my
channel the amazing mr. ah thank you so
much for having us here she is here this
is Curtis in case you didn't know the
boy named so this is his name my
favorite Queen from RuPaul's Drag Race
she's here and in case you didn't know
Curtis did my makeup she transformed me
and choo misbehaved on her channel my
sister know your fish daughter my fish
daughter of fish daughter that's the
rule if you paint as I am a veg we call
her eel sauce okay that's how the dumb
dragon roll gone though in case you
didn't see that video yet please go
check it out I'll put a link down below
go watch it I'm right here waiting for
you here we're still you I'm so winking
I'm winking at that big one
still here it's not a good back okay
good okay so we're gonna get glam now
Curtis is gonna become miss fame I'm
gonna become the halfway through
misbehave so we're gonna have fun the
street version this another trick to the
street like daywalker like we can go out
in the daytime passable passable fish
smoked fish let's do it let's do it okay
alright alright so the first thing I'm
gonna use you human actually a bomb
you always are with eyes right I always
start with eyes if we do the opposite
direction you do foundation - eyes on
each other when I shake first do you
ever do it that way no we're actually
doing the drag race edition of getting
ready so if you've not watched RuPaul's
Drag Race you have her district on
manually and they got about an hour and
a half to get in full drag and knowing
drag queens that's impossible
so I'll be using the make up for ever
ultra HD foundation sticks and it got
Curtis to use these on me in the video
fell in love and he loved it so first
they're going in with it 117 on the
inner perimeter I'm up good that's
exactly the product I use on you correct
it does wonders for a canvas yep
canvas the canvas feels good the canvas
is right rode hard and put away wet
I like to call myself that's my nickname
mom that's a short nickname girl for a
long history of never mind all right I'm
gonna take Teddy eyeliner and I'm gonna
cut a new crease if you're new to Curtis
pay attention this is what I do every
time this is what I do on even with
utilizing my natural brow the way to
find your new socket line and you can do
this with powders but for me I really
like to create a defined line I just
lift my head back into the light like so
and then as we did with you there's your
natural bone structure there's a bigger
Safa bone then yo lid is permitted so
I'm gonna just draw above all right like
here edging the line and like I like to
create a little bit more of a mood with
the shape so I go up high and then I
drop down low let me feel it in your
family no feeling and then you just
extend the line out so this is a bit I
mean it's a little choppy but like we
blend I'm just going in and I'm blending
I'm using a Cosette II brush d24 zero
you just blur out that just thing I like
about using teddy liner on um I go dear
I loved it is because I like it because
it's neutral it's not a warm brown it's
a little bit cooler and I feel like it
can um it creates more of a shadow
rather than just putting a warm crease a
warm crease cream I'm and now I know
warm creases I'm actually sitting on one
right now if I spend the most time on my
eyes I feel like that's like where a lot
of my attention ends up going to and
then I try to go masterclass through the
rest of my face eyes are the window to
be so there's a fogged glass to my ass
so what was your favorite part about
being on drag race getting to walk the
runway really I honestly I was that was
what I was most prepared for was I'm my
whole identity is miss fame as the
supermodel drag queen I wanted her to
revive the essence of beauty with no
boundaries and that gender really
doesn't have to play a card in being a
beautiful persona I was obsessed with
those old iconic women from the fifth
these and the supermodels from the 90s
so I grouped those together and when
thinking about watching the history to
show I always look forward to watching
that runway look from an acquaintance
who was creating what what were they
wearing and yes the other challenges are
fabulous in the makeover challenge I
really was hoping that we would have a
makeover challenge if they brought
somebody in that was not our drag
sisters right that was a very good twist
to this show but once you've already
buried half the cast you don't want to
bring them back so it was like girl I'm
sorry it's true that day we were so
pissed ginger was gonna go on strike
she's like no it was good that the
production team sought to bring them
back of course
I hated it twist I hated the twist I
hated it I do not want to play that game
and they're working so hard to stay in
the game yep and you saw them going then
they say one no these queens is sticking
around and you're like girl no bye who's
your favorite queen of all time uh-huh
um I always loved Raja
I still love Raja um you know and I have
a fond love for my sister violet mm-hmm
they loved her aesthetic basic me no
wait girl yes girl
no way girl girl girl so what we're
gonna do I'm going to take clear eyelash
glue this is like pageant Sheree tricky
green go I'm filling my bra line I'm
just going to go over the lid with the
entire product and I'm going to recut
that crease so I'm painting the lid with
lash glue and now I'm going to go
straight in with the glitter Oh pressing
glitter directly on that pill oh it's
magic so how'd you get turned on to Drag
Race what's your history with the show
because of you are you kidding me miss
fame was the first queen I ever
encountered on the youtubes I looked up
a video I had to contour her nose or
something yeah and there was your first
transformation video when I got a
platinum wig that was young I thought an
addiction because it was so I love
transforming or love transformations and
how you went from Curtis to miss fame
he's really amazed me it was like magic
to me
so immediately after I highlighted the
tip of my nose and it was over and I was
obsessed and because of that I found out
about drag race obsess over that and
then when the last season came around
ever that you were in it and I lost my
shit because you were my favorite Queen
and people should know that I did that
drag series where they all of every week
and every week I wanted to do Fame but I
couldn't because that would be biased
that would be like miss fame I'm not bad
about it at all I am mad about it at all
girl all that people were you know
asking me to do a look from other Queens
other Queens and I was like no I just
want to do things and I love you and I
remember watching you do my bearded
Queen look I went to a special store to
get that mustache yeah I know people
some people just didn't get it but when
I put that mustache I'm like get with
SunRun miss babe right now I know so
good about it I love your details you
are really really good at makeup like
you went in you you you studied it yep
you you cannot even dreamers even when
you were on um the passage untuck us um
and you would look down and be like open
screen oh the crease goes into a point
like that and I live for it like I was
on your social media watching that and
when I saw it was like oh this girl's
good he knows her desperation anytime a
reality TV is yep actual cooking yeah
he's special cooking and so i realized i
i went between like feeling like how i
could totally handle it as I worked with
reality people I was working with make
do makeup on reality sets yeah and I go
thinking oh I understand the flow of
this and then you're there you're like
nevermind it's like everything you
thought you knew throw it out the window
because it doesn't have any validity at
that point you're like watching your
life happen and you're there but you
must feel like it's an out-of-body
experience just try to survive an
episode at a time you know but I loved
um that I did it I loved that I was a
part of the family of drag race it's an
amazing show during the season of course
you look up to certain people yes
don't were your favorites I would say it
was him all my throat there's literally
a frog in my throat
I like fuck I can't say it beyond me um
it was violet you know I I junior was
the best actress on our season she's
really an extremely talented actress but
I feel like we get we know that works
every time we know that yeah that comedy
is going to kill there will always be a
platform for comedy but when violet had
and I got to learn a bit more about her
background I thought this is somebody
that has a skill set I have not seen in
drag race history can do what you're
wondering what are green so much we're
filming at the YouTube studios in New
York City and like a tight one like the
drag race timing I watched your
transformation legit restoring you guys
cracked me up I we were crying I loved I
could not stop he killed me it's funny I
love Jeffrey so much we're actually
doing a transformation yeah yeah come on
goals um this is a great way to get rid
of a smile line but I've noticed I feel
the bright the brightest foundation you
can get which is the TV paint stick and
zero zero
that's like a yellowy undertone I gone
with smile lines like that I fill those
pitches up so what does your favorite
look you've ever done favorite makeup oh
my god mark you got it I love my new
year's look that I posted on Instagram
in the fall latex Linda Evangelista
catsuit that I found in London um I
think that I can't clock a specific eye
I actually um I love the picture Marcelo
can to took of me where I'm wearing that
little tiny finger wave and I have a
pencil thin brow at the time I was
shaving my brows off and it's like a
dark a dark OCC lip tar and just she
didn't like yes I love it because it's
different it's a way it was like a
little bit out of the box for me I was
the first time you tucked it's horrible
is it horrible well actually
oh it's well it feels like you've got a
lot of pressure in your penis and balls
area I used to do like the Silence of
the Lambs did you ever watch that
yeah was like it puts a fucking lotion
on the sched when he wears a human skin
suit well that's how I tucked I was
pulling everything back then violet was
like girl what are you doing I'm like oh
my balls are so she actually taught me
how to physically tuck during Fashion
Week after four years of drag she
physically touched me down there Father
touch me and she showed me how she likes
to tuck and after that I was like a
woman
how does violet tuck well you push your
balls up into the pocket in the front
there's like a pocket if guy gets really
cold sometimes they go up rank but
sometimes they lift up into like that
area where the pubic areas where the
hair is and they go up there like woolum
goes in well Massa fat pussy so that um
you put your penis between your legs and
then you put a gaff on and then you've
got yourself a fierce ass bikini bottom
holy shit until the date go wrong it's a
mess girl you wanted to know does it
hurt
oh yes it's uncomfortable I've gone to
the doctor a couple times from some just
for yourselves tucking what is your
favorite makeup product mmm I have so

point if you have textured skin like man
skin acne prone skin and you still want
to glow you have to go this faces on the
face you can go I like to go at the top
of the cheekbones I woke over the entire
cheekbone like on the inside over here I

skins bit better there and avoid the
center I use my pinky to put the
highlight on the tip don't you do that

stuff I tried it out yesterday and we
went to an ice hockey game and my face
look snatched all night long I didn't
eat no powder it looked good and when
