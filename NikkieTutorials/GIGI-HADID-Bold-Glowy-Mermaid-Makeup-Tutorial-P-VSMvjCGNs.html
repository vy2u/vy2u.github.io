tutorial by holy glowing goddess
did she recently a little while ago now
she was rocking a like colorful mermaid
look on Instagram and when I saw that
look I was like I love that look so much
and it reminded me of like the old Nicky
days you know back in the day neons were
my neutrals glitters were matte to me
back in the day I used to do all these
crazy looks and with this look I kind of
feel like old Nicky is back stat today
it's time for something editorial
extreme bold colorful and mermaid
inspired by Gigi Hadid so if you want to
get creative then please keep on
watching if you don't want to get
creative then watch as I try to blend
all this okay okay enjoy alright the
first thing I'll be using is by Guerlain
and this is the award radiance
concentrate with pure gold primer make a
base now everyone knows this because of
totty glam light group so she has been
raving about this gold primer and this
supposedly tightens and lifts the face
as well as brightening and just magic so
I went out yesterday and I bought one
for myself so let's try it out today
okay first of all it doesn't feel like a
primer at all it feels like a serum it
smells lovely
alright so I just primed using the girl
and all right first foundation today
we're talking Gigi you had to say Gigi
gorgeous for a foundation today you want
it to be super super flawless
I mean worked all over talking Gigi
Hadid here so I'm going to go in with
the Ofra absolute cover in point 5 and
mixing it with my Too Faced Born This
Way in pearl and I'll be applying this
using my morphe sponge now I have a
little confession to make the first time
I tried this on camera loved it then did
my makeup after with it again and I
wasn't as in love with it but I now
found out that that was because I used
it to wet I now use it damn so yeah this
has been getting a lot of love and
love this sponge
for concealer today I'm gonna go in with
the tart shape tape concealer and fair
I'm telling you this has been one of the
best concealers out there ever since it
came out this is all I've been using it
is we're also gonna highlight with this
notice how I go a little bit below my
dark circles this will help prevent
creasing because if you goop up all the
products right at that base of the
lashes it's going to goof up its kind of
crease it's going to look like a hot
mess we don't want that and with that
same morphe blender sponge jig I'm going
to about seven
and I'm going to bake my under-eye area
using my NARS soft velvet loose powder
in snow and I'll be sending the rest of
my face is in my Georgia Armani luminous
silk powder the first thing I'm going to
do as always this is no surprise Mac
soft ochre Paint Pot the first two
colors are going to go in with our by
sugarpill
and I'm going to use these two as my
transition shade and I'm just going to
put this into crease to help blend the
crease and soften it later on I'm also
going to put it all the way to the inner
corner of the crease up till the bridge
of your nose go ahead and smoke that in
and make it really editorial and glutton
G next we're going to use this purple
also by sugarpill I'm just going to
smoke this out on the outer corners here
take your time just to blowing that up
in that crease and don't be afraid to go
high up leave a true mermaid that you
are now using that same purple we're
going to drag that all the way to the
inner crease right here for a pop of red
I'm going to take these Suva Beauty
cupcakes and monsters palette and taking
the color Bloody Mary just gonna touch
this on the very very inner part of that
crease I'm smoking it all the way to the
bridge of that nose probably going to
hop into the masquerade eyeshadow
palette by dubious place and I'm taking
the color zola and this is going all
over the lid and into the inner corners
also on the inner corners
frivolous I'm going back into that
purple by sugarpill and deepening the
inner and outer corners and applying
this blue color right here right in the
center
so really make this look come to life
I'm going to go in with the makeup
studio jewel X and shine and we're going
to highlight with this I'm going to pop
this on the inner corners and center of
the lid and to finish off up using the
an etude silly lashes oh that is some
color right there oh this is long
ago all right time to cut these cheeks
because gigi hadid cheeks are like so
I'm gonna go in with my medium sculpting
powder bike having a Quan and I'm going
to contour
all right and then with my zoeva 142
tense' fiying the base of that contour I
blend it out go back in with your face
powder underneath around it and even at
the base of that contour to soften and
almost gigi hadid not quite really but
almost there
Gigi wasn't really wearing a whole lot
of blush but I feel like I need a little
bit to just living up the face a tiny
bit so I'm gonna go in with is you a
peony just line has been just barely
there rarely there this is already
probably too much all right now for the
glow we're gonna go absolutely batshit
mermaid crazy because it's a mermaid
look so we can go all out with the shine
baby so first I'm gonna go in with the
artist Couture diamond glow powder in
supernova and this is like mermaid in a
pot it has like this beautiful pinky
shine reflex in it it is orgasmic trust
me and today I'm actually going to
change it up a little bit for that
maximum glow I'm gonna apply my
highlighter using my Beauty Blender
morphe Beauty Blender sponge alright
ready here we go
sit down wear sunglasses protection is
necessary
oh my friggin glowing Jesus whoa oh my
pitch alright that's it from now on
highlighter applying with a sponge a
damp sponge only oh my oh but you
thought we were gonna stop there mmm
we're gonna go into the Anasazi Beverly
Hills moonchild glow kit and I'm gonna
take pink heart and a tiny bit of purple
horseshoe and even more oh my god
highlighting the Cupid's bow using
another diamond glow powder right artist
couture this one is called mermaid
fantasy huh fitting and GG had a like
bluish greenish highlighter on her
Cupid's bow and it just so happens that
