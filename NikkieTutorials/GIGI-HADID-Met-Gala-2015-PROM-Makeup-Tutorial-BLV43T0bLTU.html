tutorial inspired by Gigi Hadid
at the Met Gala Gigi looked flawless
perfect and so so gorgeous and I just I
just love it because her mom is Dutch
and her mom is on the Real Housewives of
Beverly Hills and so therefore I love
Gigi so today I decided to do a tutorial
inspired by her look I went a little bit
more ballsy on the lower lash line
because I added lower lashes other than
that I think this look is absolutely
great for prom for a night out
it is super duper glam it's still
wearable and if you leave the lower
lashes out it's even more wearable it's
so much fun to do it's so easy to do so
if you're interested in knowing how to
get this look right here then please
stay tuned alright guys so prior to
filming I already went ahead and primed
my face I use my Nivea men aftershave
balm and follow through with my Smashbox
primer water for foundation today I'm
going to use the Kogan doe aqua
foundation and this is number 213
Gidi looked absolutely flawless so we
want our base to look flawless as well
so I'm going to go in with my concealer
this is max Pro Longwear in NC 15 I'm
going to buff this all in using my Real
Techniques sponge in now setting the L
with powder to prevent it from creasing
for the eyes of first gonna prime ease
my soft ochre Paint Pot by Mac so
eyeshadow wise there wasn't a lot going
on with her look that day so for this
look you just want to sculpt and define
your features but not too much and just
keep it all very subtle so the first
color I'll use for my crease is by
makeup geek cosmetics and this is purely
naked and I'm buffing this in just on
the sides of my crease with my zoeva 228
you want to keep it on the outer portion
of your crease do not bring it inwards
to deepen that I'm taking this Revie
derm duo eyeshadow and this is called
Marilyn and I'm taking the darkest Brown
and with my 221 by Mac I'm softly
bringing in a tiny bit more focus a bit
more definition but nothing too drastic
you would get super soft wearable and
glam for the little be using another
makeup geek eyeshadow this is shimma
shimma and i'm applying this with a damp
brush
for my lower lashline um again taking a
Revie term dual eyeshadow and this is
called earth angel and I'm taking the
tiniest bit of this brown color right
here and mixing it with makeup geeks in
the spotlight foiled eyeshadow this will
create just the tiniest bit of
definition on the lower lash line and
for that super intense glow that Gigi
had on the inner corners of her eyes I'm
taking this the bomb sexpot overshadow
it's a pigment and this is called no
money no honey and I'll also apply this
with a damp brush just glow up those
inner corners and then sweep it back on
to the lid this for my liner today I'll
course use my Keaveney tattoo liner in
trooper and filling that in with NYC
liquid liner in black and the wing
shaper going for today is short and
sassy so we're going to wing it but not
drag it out too far and also not too
thick or too little
For Lashes today I'm of course gonna go
for house of lashes as always today I'll
be using the Bambi lashes for my top
lashes and now a little twist I'm adding
to the look I'm going to add lower
lashes because I feel like for far away
Gigi's lower lashes looked so perfect
that I cannot do that with mascara so
I'm going to use these House of lashes
precious lashes and those are going on
the bottom you can totally skip the
lower lashes but I just feel like it
just makes it look so much more cute and
young and fresh and then with your
finger push the lower lashes up so they
look slightly more natural just like
that let's go onto cheeks now if you
naturally have gorgeous cheekbones just
like Digi go ahead and skip contouring
you don't need all that contouring now
if you're using let's look for prom I
definitely would contour because with
all the flash photography it will blow
out a lot of your features and bringing
those features back in with contouring
really helps for photography so I'm
going to contour today using my Kat Von
D shade and light palette oh and if
you're wondering where I got my rings
from I got my rings from Lotus &amp;amp; Co and
this is a store founded by one of my
great friends and I highly suggest you
checking it out I will put the link down
below but if you want awesome cool rings
and they have bunch of other awesome
stuff then check it out so as I said I'm
first going to contour it I'm going to
use a mixture of these two shades right
here to give myself the beautiful GG
bronze I'm taking this on two-faced
milk chocolate bronzer most chocolate
smells like milk chocolate milk
delicious and just warming up my
complexion using this for blush I'm
going to use down boy blush by the balm
just on the apples of your cheeks very
lightly
then for an out-of-this-world glow
because gigi was glowing like a goddess
our first going to go in with this dose
of colors baked highlighter in pearl
dust this is a pinky highlighter I'm
going to use this to glow up my blush so
taking that same blush brush and going
just over the apples of my cheeks where
I also placed my blush just to give it a
glow just on the top and that should
give you a very fun glow and then for
the ultimate glow I'm taking the bombs
mary lou manizer and this brush right
here this is by ready derm this is the
blush brush and just glow all over and
that's it for the glowing cheeks for the
lips you want to go nude and glossy so
first kind of line my lips using boldly
bare lip pencil by Mac
for lipstick i'll be using politely pink
by mac and that guys concludes is gigi
