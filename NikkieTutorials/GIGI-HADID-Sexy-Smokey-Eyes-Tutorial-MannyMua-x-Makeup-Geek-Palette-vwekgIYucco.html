inspired by gorgeous super stained model
Gigi Hadid beautiful fleeky I'm obsessed
and jealous she recently hit the red
carpet for an event and she wore this
beautiful red cranberry smoky grungy
eyes and I got so many requests for it
on my Twitter so like so many requests
for it like my mind could not take how
many requests there were and there was
one pallid which seemed destined for
this look the mani pellet many makeup
artists collaborated with makeup geek
cosmetics and they created this awesome
I shoulda palette it does go into
presale on February 23rd and it's
official launch is the day after
February 24th this palette was just made
for this look it was made for this Gigi
Hadid super sexy smoky eyes look so I
decided to play with it today so I'll
put a link down below on where you can
get it once it hits the makeup geek
stores and without any further ado if
you would like to know how to get this
digital how to makeup look super sexy
super smoky then keep on watching
alright the first thing you want to do
for this sexy licious face is prime
today I'm gonna prime using these skin
danava priming spray and I especially
love this one because it doesn't contain
any silicones and silicones when you put
them on the face throughout the day they
get a little bit slippy and they make
your makeup run off they just makeup
melts and this skin a navy eye primer
spray doesn't have silicone so you do
not have that problem of it sliding up
throughout the day so I really like this
as a primer so I'm going to use it as a
primer alright for a foundation you want
that supermodel skin so you want your
skin to be top-notch
amazing beautiful on fleek flaky duh so
my go-to foundation for that is my Make
Up For Ever Ultra HD foundation Stix and
I'm going to use 120 on the outer
perimeter of my face and 117 on the
inner
and now that you look like an art piece
you're going to take your Beautyblender
and blend it in
for conceal are going to use the Kevin
upon sensual skin enhancer in sxo one
and make it a little bit lighter using
micro NTV pin stick in double zero
and I'm quickly going to set and bake
using the NARS soft velvet loose powder
in snow I'm priming my eyelids using
soft ochre Paint Pot by Mac with Mac's
vanilla eyeshadow i'm going to set my
crease to brow bone area to help
blending later on i'm going to apply on
the stasi beverly hills dusty rose eye
shadow to my crease to give that nice
blowout transition color and for this
I'm using a Mac 224 brush and unlike
usual I now start on the inner crease
because it's a grungy supermodel look
and models can get away with everything
so we're going to really smoke out that
inner crease to give that really grungy
feel and to give it that nice blowout
effect the higher you come into your
crease the less pressure you want to
apply to your brush so up here I'm
barely touching my skin of course we
also need some definition on the outer
corner so just start swirling and
blending that in and again the higher
you come into that crease the less
pressure on your brush once I've got
most of the color on I like taking that
brush really lightly barely touching the
skin and going back and forth to really
give it a nice gradient from the makeup
geek mani palette I'm taking this color
right here and mixing it with the red
and with a zueva 234 that is going on
the lid as my base color now I'm going
to take insomnia and I'm going to use
this to darken and smoke everything out
and also mix in that a little bit with
the red color which is called Mars to
give everything a little bit more of an
orange you feel gonna take the middle
color which is called Sora and really
lightly with a morphe MV 23 I'm just
blending that in
now I'm going to take this color again
but this time I'm going to reapply to
the lid with a damp brush and going back
in with the darker colors to blend
everything nicely for the lower lash
line I'm going to smoke it out using
these three colors right here and
putting the color down using a zoeva 240
brush now also all the way to the inner
corners and smoke it out
I'm gonna use the bombs batter up in
pinch-hitter on the lash line I have no
idea what the name means all I want to
do now to finish is you some very
natural falsies and I'm using the Ardell
whispies all right for cheeks of course
you want a contour because Gigi Hadid
cheekbones ha sleek
for this is going to use my Kevyn Aucoin
sculpting powder in medium and my
favorite morphe brush to contour with my
m5 30 and I went a little bit light
under my eyes because the eyes are so
bright so with this you can really
balance the face I'm going to quickly
contour my nose off-camera and if you
want an updated tutorial on how I
contour my nose nowadays then click the
pull somewhere in the screen there will
be a pull you can click yes or no and
that way I will know if I should do the
video or not I'm going to warm up my
complexion a little bit more using this
color right here by Mac this is in the
color bone beige and using my Cosette
number one brush and really lightly dust
this on the apples of the cheeks now
following the contour just add a little
bit of warmth I'm also going to do a
little bit coming from the hairline
blending gel not too much because I look
muddy in two point two seconds when I do
my forehead which sucks for blush you're
going to use the tiniest bit of Sigma or
a powder in pet name and my Cosette
number two brush
and now you want to grace your face with
highlighter because Gigi looked super
super glowy dewy and just so I'm going
to use moonstone by Becca for this and
my favorite brush to use that with is my
morphe m3 ten
tip of the nose Cupid's bow and the
tiniest bit from the highest point of
your arch up to your forehead just tiny
tiny teeny tiny bit and because they use
so many powder products that can quickly
look a little bit more powdery and cakey
a trick to make yourself look natural
natural beautifully glowy and just
gorgeous is to use a makeup setting
spray
I use these Scandinavia make a primer
spray so I'm going to finish using their
finishing spray her lips are going to
keep it super simple nude with a little
bit of warmth so first I'm going in with
Mac's creme de nude lipstick and adding
just a tiniest bit of warm fusing kind
of sexy
and there you go and that guy's
