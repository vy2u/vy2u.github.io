the winter when it's hot is killing you
and like wants you to pass out and die
so welcome to my basement here is where
the spiders unite and the food is stock
the wine is docked the everything that
is somewhere gross it's docked here and
I feel like I can be bitten nice burger
and he's thinking now but anything for
YouTube right I went onto the wing a
Selena Gomez coming in a music video in
spite the tutorial because the weather
today will be so much nicer and easier
to live with well no the winter in here
is so bad and it's so humid that once
you like flick your arm you sweat it's
so hot in here so I decided to move to
my basement I'm sorry for the lighting
like the worst that I've ever in the
audio and everything but I'm just gonna
do a quick giveaway today because what
else are you gonna do and can't film
with makeup tutorial okay so I'm wearing
my sunglasses because that's why I'm not
wearing anything
so today's giveaway is gonna be on three
things my previous giveaway was a great
success and I didn't expect that because
normally giveaways on my channel end up
and like a horror movie and they end up
terrible but the last giveaway was
precious it was amazing and everything
went alright
today's giveaway is the same as last
time I'm gonna deal with Rafflecopter so
there's a Rafflecopter link on my
website to get tutorials calm and with
razzle copter you can do a lot of
different things to enter yourself you

that's an entry the things I'm giving
away are some random things so the first
thing I'm giving away is this boohoo
lemmings
in this neon pride Aztec print I
absolutely adore these the problem is is
that these are way too short for me
because I'm 6 foot 2 so I'm giving away
these Aztec print leggings by busuu.com
so that this prize number one so you can
enter yourself for this this is a size a
large so this is for my taller bigger
ladies but not 6 / 2 because this will
be too short for you I didn't have any
problems sort of like fun wise but lack
length wise too short then also I have
this Mac medium plus a share mystery
powder which is so darn cute like the
packaging is amazing plus I got a refill
so if you finish this powder right here
then I have a refill for you so you can
have another powder the reason I'm
giving this away is because this is too
dark for my complexion I haven't used it
the problem is that there is some wipes
going on because there was the sponge in
it that like wiped the powder clear up
the sponge and I left with the powder
and the refill and the packaging is rose
gold and like a bow and it's super duper
cute and this will be for a second
winner the last price I have for you is
this Kardashian beauty chroma Beauty
intimate spotlight highlighter this is a
highlighter / eyeshadow in one stop
this is the night for those specials

min this is number 109 called
incandescent ink in stop it with the
sink so those are my three prices I have
the blue linings
the share mystery covered by neck and
the Kardashian beauty highlighter let me
know if you like this entire shtick
because when it's too hot outside like
above this place right here I'm just
gonna sit here and chill okay so that
are these things gonna give away on to

subscriber I mean you have to be a
subscriber another rule is that you have
