on this makeup look right here I have no
idea what I'm going to call it yet but
it's a fun one because I'll be using a
lot more affordable products than I
normally would lately I've been getting
a lot of requests to use more affordable
products and right around that time
carroty contacted me to feature them in
a video
and basically what cara d does is they
make affordable dupes for high-end
makeup like Mac Urban Decay all the
high-end stuff so picked a couple of
their products up and what's really
helpful is that they have like guides
with actual dupes on it so let's say you
wanted Mac's floof eyeshadow on the
eyeshadow guide it will say that fluffs
dupe is patina in carroty so I picked my
favorite matte colors to really see if
they held up to the test and if they
aren't really truly alike and the
bristles are just amazing so let's start
off by showing you temptress and this is
a dead on do for embark by Mac my
favorite matte color if you want to do
Mac's all that glitters the carroty
shadow would be shrill Kara Dee's diva
is a dupe for coppering by Mac another
all-time favorite is Mac's sketch and
Kara Dee's vino is really really amazing
and last but not least the ultimate
transition color soft round by Mac has a
perfect dupe and caridy called inaud so
I tried them in this tutorial and I
think the shadows are great they have
amazing color payoff they are blendable
and they feel like an high-end eyeshadow
if you're interested in purchasing any
carroty stuff I'll put a link down below
so this is an affordable one mostly for
all of you I tried I tried I hope you
enjoy all right so let's get into it the
first I'm gonna do is moisturize my face
using my new favorite
Cetaphil moisturizing cream and I got
this because of Kim ty you're on YouTube
she's been raving on and on and on about
this and finally when I saw her again in
the States last week I decided to get
one of these it just makes her skin so
moisturized and it gets you ready to go
for a full package of makeup oh my god I
love it so much for foundation today I'm
gonna go in with the Milani - and one
can steal and perfect foundation
in number one creamy vanilla and because
it oxidizes on me I'm going to go in
with a lighter foundation to counteract
fat but this will be my main foundation
on my face and I'll be using a Beauty
Blender to apply this
for concealer today I'm going to go in
with the NARS creamy concealer in
Gentilly and I haven't used this one in
ever and again blending and using my
Beauty Blender
and setting it using mine our soft
velvet loose powder and snow I'm going
to start out by priming the eyelid so
this look will last all night long
and I'm going to set my crease to brow
bone area using a light shadow to help
blending later on for the crease I'll be
going in with carroty eyeshadow anodd
and this is an exact dupe for Mac's soft
brown and with a soft blending brush and
just going to define my crease using
that
with Cara deez temptress which is an
exact tube for max embark I'm going to
cut my crease and I'll be doing that
with a flat angle brush and now with
this small buffing brush I'm going to
buff that in
now going in with the tarte waterproof
clay pot and white as the base on my
eyelid and to further cut my crease now
what this you can really further cut and
define underneath that crease
and setting it with a white shadow right
over top of that base I'm going to
Sparkle up the base of that cut crease
right below the line using this heavy
metal glitter liner by urban decay and
the color glam rock
and then in the center using a lavender
3d glitter by make up forever for my
wing today we'll be using this ardency
in punker rock on liquid liner and now
filling the rest of the eyeliner in
using a liquid liner going back in with
Kara Dee's temptress and defining my
lower lash line now going in with Kara D
superfreak which is the dupe for Mac's
wedge and continuing defining my lower
lash line with this a for a slime pop of
color on the waterline I'll be going in
with color pops cream gel liner in
cry-baby
and lastly to finish off with lashes I'm
using the hoodie beauty fair lashes
ah all right that was the battle I had
to film that I portion twice cuz I
didn't realize we weren't filming okay
so I'm going to contour for the cheeks
and contour using the Kevin tequan
medium sculpting powder and this carrot
EF 21 brush which reminds me a lot of my
favorite contouring brush is I'm going
to use it today
so give my face a little bit more bronze
go in with the cover effects bronzer and
sunkissed just for a little bit of
additional warmth for blush I'm going to
use the elf blush palette and light I'm
going to go in with this color right
here ever highlight of course I'm going
to go in with my favorite Becca
moonstone the tip of my nose to round
off any dead black so of the hater
that's coming for me and I keep it all
right Fred lips are gonna go in with the
new lip land liquid lipstick in 50/50
