on this makeup look right here I am
playing with my oppress slash naked
tutorials collection today because today
actually a couple of hours ago the
collections relaunched it is back in
stock plus all the items are now
available individually so I kind of just
wanted to play with my own products and
show you different ways of playing with
them so today I came up with this very
spring/summer graphic eyeliner look so
today we're really going to glam it up
and play with the products and as always
I just want you to know that if you're
ordering anything from the collection
you can use discount code Nikki a check
out to save 30% off your order I just
quickly wanted to put that in because I
got a lot of tweets last time that
people ordered and then they tweeted me
saying shoot I forgot your discount code
and now I paid so much more than I had
to so I just wanted to put that out
there but yeah we're playing with a
little bit of color and glitter and glam
in today's video so sit back relax and
let's let's get close together it is
1:00 in the morning and Here I am
getting glammed one in the morning so
since I'll just be wearing this for this
video I'm not really going to really go
in on the priming so I'm quickly going
to go in with the issue a anti-aging
moisture primer for foundation today
we'll go in with my trusty my Lancome
Dona and our petty dual ultra 24 hour
makeup in 100 ivory neutral you guys
know my obsession with this one I just
like it and i'll be applying this using
my Sigma 3d HD Blender sponge the
sponges are really doing for me like I
said in a previous video it is a whole
lot softer than the regular Beauty
Blender and once you get used to that
it's almost like you can go back like
for me I just feel like it applies the
makeup a little bit softer and smoother
and the Beauty Blender almost has a
little bit more texture then this sponge
is just the
sign just taken over my heart I can't
help it and yeah get out bit time to
clear these under eyes up and now let's
set our under-eye area using the
dermablend powder
as always going in with the primer of
all primers the Mac soft ochre Paint Pot
to keep this look on all day long so
I'll be grabbing this neutral bone color
right here and I'm going to set this all
over the lid this will create a nice
smooth base to work with now I'm going
to grab a bunch of these neutrally
peachy warm tone colors and slightly
defined a crease with them
man go go in with the Oprah / naked
tutorials spell liquid lipstick and I'm
going to use this as a base for my
winged liner
now I'm taking the Knicks glitter primer
and going over top of where it placed my
liner and setting that using this Helen
eegh litter in tangerine
now I'm going to go ahead and grab a
little bit of the peaches and cream
flamingos pigment and mix it with the la
splash till midnight elixir and with
this I'm going to create a fine line in
the crease connecting to the eyeliner as
a nice graphic touch
and then just on the center of that line
I'm applying a little bit of the peaches
and cream pigment in Disco
going into ever glow and taking the
lightest shade to highlight my brow bone
in either corner for the lower last time
of taking this mustardy Inglot color and
this curly peachy one for like I said
for the lower lash line
to finish off all we need is some lashes
and today I'm going to be using
lion-hearted by Kim Chi in collaboration
with cake face beauty all right so for
cheeks I'm going to start off with the
huge I'm going to start bronzing using
my hoola light by benefit with the hoola
brush I know it's been doing it into so
many videos recently but it just gives
me that soft warmth that I kind of miss
with my like deathly skintone
for blush your going to go in with
benefits dandelion and of course for my
glow how can I not ever glow
and for lips I'm going to go with my
all-time favorite nude this goes with
everything and anything and I know I've
done a couple of new lips in the recent
videos so I promise you that my next
videos will have a little bit of a
bolder lip but for today's look is going
to go in with nude potion also part of
my collaboration with Oprah I swear to
you this is my favorite nude like it
goes with every look it just it makes me
feel so confident and sexy and I feel
like a softer lip would be perfect with
these eyes
and then I'm also going to put a little
bit of gloss over top this is you a
blush lip gloss not to seal the deal all
we need to do is set it with a some
setting spray and that guy's includes
this fun summer spring colorful glitter
liner makeup look I really really
