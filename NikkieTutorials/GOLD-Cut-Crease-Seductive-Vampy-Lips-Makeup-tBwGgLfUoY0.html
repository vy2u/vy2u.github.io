installment of my new series RuPaul's
Drag face just like last year every week
I'll be doing a look inspired or
recreated by my favorite look of this
week's episode of RuPaul's Drag Race so
sometimes it will get very very drag and
sometimes I would just be inspired and
take certain elements of looks or maybe
someone from the judges and it's just
gonna be so much fun just like last year
I had such a ball with this one last
year say I hope you are excited about
this these videos will go up every
Friday so that means from now on you
will get three videos from me a week and
the RuPaul's Drag Face tutorials every
Friday this week I decided to take
inspiration from Naomi smalls on the
runway so far she's definitely one of my
top favorites because she is so gorgeous
and I stalked her Instagram a little and
her makeup is on point and I love her
style so I decided for my first
installment why not do an inspired look
by Naomi smalls with the dark lips gold
eyes cut crease lashes all the way and
let's just go crazy so if you want to
know how to get this look right here
then please keep on watching the first
thing I'll be doing today is applying a
good moisturizer because my skin is dry
and since we're really packing all the
coverage on today we need all the
moisture we can get so I'm going to go
in with my Kiehl's ultra facial
moisturizer for foundation today I'm
going to go for the Make Up For Ever
Ultra HD foundation Stix and I'm going
to go with 117 on the inner perimeter of
my face and 120 on the outer
and I blending it all in using my beauty
blender
for concealer I'm going to go in with
the naked concealer by urban decay in
fair neutral and making it a type of
more light and extreme using this Kyle
NTV pan stick in double zero
and now I'm going to bake using the NARS
soft velvet loose powder in snow in
order to make this look glass as long as
possible I'm going to prime using my Mac
soft ochre Paint Pot and applying it
using my Sigma 3d HD precision brush now
I'm going to set my crease to brow bone
area using a lighter matte shade and
this will really help blend in later on
with makeup geek Americano eyeshadow
I'll be cutting my crease and for this
it's best to look straight ahead in a
mirror and just place your crease a tiny
tad bit above your natural crease like I
did here it's just right above it and
then just follow through by following
the natural curve of your eye and then
it's just a little bit more dramatic and
the version reason for this is a makeup
studio number twenty two brush
now mixing americano with Barcelona
Beach also by makeup geek cosmetics and
with my Cosette P 365 brush I'm just
going to start blending that crease that
a little bit more
you want to remember to never go below
this line to sort of speak this is your
new crease and we're now going to put
anything below your new crease because
everything below your new crease is for
that beautiful gold now with my Cosette
D 220 and Barcelona Beach only I start
blending even more
and then with my zoeva 228 same color we
applied in the crease and brow bone you
can kind of use it as an eraser for the
gold I'm going to go in with this
amazing metal pigment by donessa Marik's
and it's in the color Faro and as my
mixing medium today to really make it
stick I'll be using the Bionic gel
activator by Bionic Beauty so first I
apply a layer of that gel as a base and
remember with this you can also really
clean up the line underneath the crease
picks up on that pigment up and Pat it
on top
now with my morphe e43 brush and
americano only are really going to
concentrate on the base of that new
crease for the waterline I'm going to go
in with these zoeva graphic eyes in
black to earth and with my tweezerman
lion glider brush and americano only I'm
just going to buff that in free going
liner I'll first be making my outline
using the Kat Von D tattoo liner in
trooper now using Sigma's aligning and
legend to continue the wing now it's
time for some crazy amazing lashes these
are by elevation lashes and these are
called ascension number 5 and for the
lower lashes I decided to go a little
bit more on the softer side so I went
for the House of lashes precious lashes
okay now that we finished up on these
beautiful golden eyes it's time to cut
those cheeks and get our contouring on
today I'll be contouring using a Kevin
ik 1 medium sculpting powder and my
morphe m5 30 brush and remember this is
a drag tutorial but if you want to wear
this as a woman please make the contour
as intense and stark as you want and I'm
thinking I'm going to go a little bit
more extreme today
but I'm also gonna do a tiny bit of nose
contouring and by tiny I mean a lot now
as you can see this is way too intense
so a trick is to grab a bigger brush and
your face powder and just glide it over
top to soften the harshness of it and
this will also blend it down it still
has a define minal but it's less harsh
this is a trick I picked up from Miss
fame and it's amazing and that's make it
even more intense what you can do is
pick your beauty blender up with some
powder and on top of the edge of the
contour line you created you want to
bake and this will make it even more
intense but it will also clean up any
shadows you don't want and then brush
away again and that way you have a nose
contour that remains very soft but still
very effective I'm going to warm up my
face using my Too Faced milk chocolate
bronzer and light/medium and my Cosette
number one brush for blush I'm going to
go in with Mac's Spellbinder and my
Cosette number two brush if we're that
ultimate glow I'm first going in with
Becca moonstone and my favorite morphe
highlighting brush this is the M 310 and
if you use code Nicki you will get a
discount on all more feet also putting
that a little bit above the tip of my
nose and my Cupid's bow
for lips up first gonna line using
colour-pop lippie pencil in creature
to fill in I'll be going in with
coloured raine matte lip paint in
Tootsie and if you use code Nicky one
you'll get a discount on all colored
brain
and on the center the tiniest bit of
Anasazi Beverly Hills Heather's all we
have to do now to finish off is give
ourselves a spritz with all nighter
spray by urban decay and we're set and
locked for the day and that guys
