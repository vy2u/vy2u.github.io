another day another challenge so today I
tried to come up with a brand new
challenge that I don't think I've seen
before but you know you two boys you
never know nowadays today we're doing
the Google pics my makeup challenge the
rules are actually super super simple
for every Google pics my makeup
challenge I want to do in the future
there is a theme and today's first theme
is typing in the first letter of your
first name and the first letter of your
last name and then pasting look after it
so in my case that would be NJ look the
first image right there is what you're
going to take as your inspiration for
your look today when I click on it I see
buildings oh I'm happy with this I have
a little row of houses and I see a
pastel pink I see pastel yellow and I
see a pastel blue and then the sky is
white so that could be my hair later
look at colors look at details look at
textures zoom in if you can find a new
color a new texture that you can play
with for your look today now I will say
I am getting pretty lucky today but I
can imagine that some of you will have a
real challenge so I dare you to play
this challenge with me let me know how
this goes for you and without any
further ado let's do my first Google
pics my makeup look alright so imagine
some of you being like what is going on
why is there enough foundation on your
face while you're straight into eyes
I've worked with Mitchell over the past
few days and he really inspired me to
start trying doing eyes before
foundation and all of that so everyone
want to give it a go today and see how
it goes for me and see if I can actually
do it so the first thing we're doing
today is eyes so when I look at my image
the first apparent thing of course are
the three main colors pastel pink yellow
and blue but I also see these little
rooftops here that have like a minty
shade it's got the grayish road it's got
the details of black it's got the trees
so I have some room to play with here
first I'm carving out my
using the NARS creamy concealer
then now going in with the P Lewis base
to pry my eyelid and this primer is
really going to help you make those
colors pop
so my first color is going to be that
sweet pastel pink so I'm gonna go in
with cherry blossom from the Sigma cream
the Couture palette and I'm first
stamping that on to the inner third of
my eye and notice I'm stamping it on and
not smearing or blending it on I'm
really putting my brush up and down to
distribute that color no rubbing no
blurring no blending just stamping it on
into place and I'm kind of going for a
Stacy Maria me way on Instagram inspire
look she recently finally did a tutorial
and I'm really inspired by her today so
I'm placing the color sort of like how
she placed it in hers the next building
in the picture is a pastel yellow so I'm
going in with this yellow right here but
it's a little too pasilla so I might go
in with a brighter yellow after and
again stamping it on no blending no
circular motions up and down onto that
lid and there patting that color on it's
always doing all the work for you who
pat over the lines where they meet and
it sort of kind of blurs it for you
without doing any harsh blending work
and for the blue I'm using blue
chocolate
Oh my-y in my head was this so cute but
now that it's on my eyes I'm like Google
you played me so I'm gonna go back into
the yellow to kind of reintubate it and
find a way to make this cool ooh
by adding the yellow it kind of
transferred into a lime green this I'm
liking this is a fun pastel rainbow look
going on right here but I'm missing a
little bit of Nikki so it's looking a
little rainy over at my photo so rain
equals glitter thank you so gonna put a
little bit of the peaches pigment in
Hollywood just on the center
and thank God we're doing foundation
after cuz if we had all of this and top
our from nation it would have been a
journey so to move to our lower lashline
first we have to do our base so let's do
it
I am fully aware of the fact that this
is looking at Rochas but I mean I look
like my Google image right
I feel like lashes are really gonna save
this like I said I'm taking full
inspiration from everything that
Mitchell has taught me over the last
couple of days so I'm using a brush for
foundation yes the day is here
some consumer stamping it in with that
same brush okay that is the base done
now let's focus on the under-eye and
lashes for the under-eye I'm taking that
same blue and just applying it towards
the outer corner of my lower lash line
you know what this looks needs liner
because at the road the road is dark
liner is dark let's do it see that's
what it needed a little bit of road all
right so I feel like that really saved
the look all you need to do who when in
doubt is follow the road or apply the
road to your eyes okay moving on lashes
today I'm using the Tati lashes in TL
three now from here on it's smooth
sailing because we're just going to do
cheeks and lips and I feel like the eyes
took the picture really literally so
here we are I'm gonna bronze using this
Mac bronzer this is not actually a
bronzer this is the next to nothing
pressed powder in medium dark
for blush I'm gonna take this sort of
pinky color right here to spruce up the
cheats a little and for a highlighter
I'm using this pinky one right here oh
my god hello oh hello
okay we're saving this look at the rain
and the cloudy sky is on my cheeks
highlighting right now this saves
everything oh we have arrived
I can currently be found on Google Maps
let me quickly apply some brows
off-camera and then we're done alright
to wrap up this look I just want to go
for a safe a nude glossy lip because
there's a lot happening right here I
just want to stay I just want to take
this moment I think I released saved
this up with the liner and the lashes
because throughout the video I wanted to
stop so many times it was like this is
total and utter trash let me just walk
away from life and never come back I'm
starting to really dig this look so
let's wrap it up with some lips I'll go
in with my favorite nude lipstick this
is McCall from the Maybelline and Gigi
Hadid collection
and the freak loss is gonna go in with
the brand-new Mario and k'kaw lipgloss
in super nude and to seal the deal some
setting spray and that guys concludes my
google picks my makeup look it went a
lot of ways but hopefully you agree that
it went a fun way because in the end I
really like what I'm looking at I love
the colors I love the hint of glitter
I love the liner I love the lashes I
love the nude lips so it was a very
Google Maps erode but we got there and I
really dare you to do this challenge as
well because it's a lot of fun and you
have absolutely no idea what Google will
bring up for you so remember first
letter of your first name and the first
letter of your last name apply look
after it and then the first image is
where you take your inspiration from
take inspiration from the colors the
textures the setting the scenery the
feeling take inspiration from it all and
create your look with it and this is
mine inspired by the three cute little
houses so definitely let me know if I
should do another one soon and then let
me know what I should search for next to
determine my look for a full list of
every single product mentioned and used
