hey guys so welcome to a new installment
of my RuPaul's Drag Race series today I
was inspired by my winner this week was
violet chachki again it was a close tie
between pearl miss fame and violet this
week pearl was actually my favorite but
the look was so similar to that other
look I already did so I opted for this
violet look because it was so intense so
colorful so fun that I think that if you
leave the lips out it might actually be
fun for like a dramatic spring look also
so that's why I'm calling this a
dramatic green spring makeup look
inspired by violet chachki of episode
number 4 so yeah that's it thank you so
much for watching and if you want to
know how to get this look right here the
please keep on watching ha the first
thing I put on is by Dior this is the
glow Maximizer and um those are my fan
start now for foundation today we're
doing drag so I'm going for my cry on TV
paint sticks so I'm first laying down my
base which is with the color g19 1 and
then I'm going to buff this in using a
brush
to contour I'm using the Krylon SS 31 TV
pants ik
you
then to conceal and highlight I'm again
taking a Kryolan TV pant stick this is
406
I'm now quickly going to set my under
eye area using some powder to prevent it
from creasing let's do some nose
contouring now and have paid extra close
attention to violets nose contouring in
the last couple of episodes and it's
it's very thin so we're going very thin
with the nose today
and then of course also some
highlighting so now going to do my brows
and one eye off-camera and then it will
be back so as always the first thing I'm
doing for my eyes is priming them to
prevent them from creasing enemies my
soft ochre Paint Pot by Mac so as always
I'm not going in with a dark matte
eyeshadow and sketching out where I want
my new crease and eyeliner to go to
so now that we've got that it's time to
focus more on the lid and you can just
go over the eyeliner portion it doesn't
matter because we're going back over top
with black later on so for the eyelids
I'm first using this super shock shadow
by color pop called fizz so this is just
going from the lash line towards the new
crease and to set that I'm taking the
Urban Decay electric palette and I'm
taking this color right here which is
called trash
for a creased transition shade of taking
fun I shadow by on excessively hills and
with this I'm going to bust in my new
creased and you want to make it super
smoky and diffused so we definitely need
a transition shade to make it all look
super blended and nice and then even
with a fluffy blending brush keep
diffusing and blending that out then to
deepen the deepest parts of that new
crease I'm again taking two Anastasia
Beverly Hills eye shadows I'm taking hot
chocolate and for even more darkness I'm
taking a deep brown but just at the base
of that new crease start darkening
everything up and blending it into the
Fond I shadow and then with an angled
brush I'm just defining that base line
even more
now with my Kevin eat a two liner in
trooper and my NYC black liquid liner
I'm just going to fill in that winged
liner and complete that winged liner
part
then to give the lid some sparkles I'm
going to apply a glitter this one is by
NYX and this is called hot yellow but
the duochrome
in it is green so we'll actually make
green more green this way you're making
that new cut crease look even more sharp
for the lower lash line I'm again taking
uh necessity Beverly Hills hot chocolate
and deep brown and this is going right
onto my lower lash line
don't make it too thick and then you
want to create like a little gap and
that will optically open up the eyes and
I'm taking LMS cos precision ink in
scribe and this is going right in
between to open up the eyes even more
and then for some jewels I'm taking one
little silver rhinestone and this is
going on the very inner corner all you
want to do now is the pipes of falsies
and your eyes are done now let's move on
to cheeks I already did most of the
contouring using that Kryolan t v--
paint stick but I'm still going to
enhance some of the shadows a little bit
more using my Kat Von D shade and light
palette and just with a bigger brush I'm
enhancing those shadows not with a
really precise and dense brush because
then it will be a little bit too much
for me so just with a bigger brush buff
some shadow in then for blush I'm using
NARS Gaiety I think so that's how you
pronounce it right
and then for highlighting of course
Becca shimmering skin Perfector in
moonstone I know you're getting sick and
tired of me using this in almost every
video I do but I cannot help it this
glow it gives is I wake up in the
morning and I'm like I can't wait to
look that glowy again
and then for lips I think personally if
I would do this look on myself I would
go for new lips because I just feel like
that green needs all the attention it
can get
but violet chachki went for a hot almost
neon looking pink so I'm inspired by
that sorry cuz I'm going to do that so
first I'm going to line my lips using
the Mac old pencil in magenta and a
little bit of embrace me
and then for the lipstick I'm taking
this coloured raine amazing rain liquid
lipstick
now go ahead and slap your favorite wig
on and you're done and that guy's

makeup look inspired by violet chachki
