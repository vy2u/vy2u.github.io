actually just a week that I didn't fit
in ye in this video I will be doing the
15 weird questions tag I got tagged by I
wanted to see a video Bethany I love you
you know what you know but before I do
that I have a little announcement
remember a couple of weeks ago that I
did a meet-up in backstage in Amsterdam
because so many girls wanted to come but
they couldn't I'm doing another one at
this Saturday so on this Saturday
that is the 27th of August I'm a
backstage again so I will be there the
entire day the address address I don't
know address is right here oh yeah so
I'm just putting that out there if you
want to meet me then please go to
Amsterdam backstage and I will be there
this Saturday for the 50 weird questions
tag Bethenny tagged me loved her
versions are Carli Christman's one loved
it so um here we go what is the nickname
only your family calls you everybody who
is somewhat close to me calls me Nick my
mom calls me Nick basically everyone
yeah everyone who is somewhat close to
me or really close to me like friendship
and stuff they call me Nick what a weird
habit of yours a weird habit of mine is
that everything on my desk has to play
um like exactly how I wanted to be like
um let's say my hand is my desk and
someone moves this powder like that I go
insane in my brain and I just want it
like do you have any weird phobias when
I'm eating and everyone around me is
eating I'm absolutely fine with
everything just chew it just have some
fun and enjoy your food but once I'm
done eating and I'm not chewing anymore
so I can hear others I go nuts when I
hear like gooey greasy food in someone's
mouth like chewing it up it makes me
want to gag
oh it's just I cannot bear it like it's
all fine when I'm eating myself because
then I'm not concentrating on it I'm
just concentrating on the good food
that's in my mouth
but when I hear someone else like to
like hear it inside their mouths like oh
what's a song you secretly love to bless
and belt out when you're alone there's
one song the one I'm grumpy and when I'm
down I always listen to the song called
I believe it's called shoot'em and it's
French and it's is like oversexed song
with like they're almost having sex on
the tape itself and it's like to Jim oh
no oh Jim if you haven't heard that
song yet I will put it in the infobox
below
you will die you probably know it
already but I love to play a song when
I'm down what is one of your biggest pet
peeves my biggest pet peeve is when
someone just um like on Twitter when
they're like they're acting like they're
Oprah or God or Jesus or I don't know
who and they're like oh I'm so good like
I hate people who have to brag about
every single thing in their life like
they would brag about sitting on the
damn toilet like I'm taking a now
are you jealous
what's one of your nervous habits when
I'm nervous I always do this
I don't know why but when I'm nervous I
always just put the hair behind my ears
and I keep making sure that they're
behind it what side of the bed do you
sleep on and that's easy because I have
a one person that so I'm the only one
who can basically lie in it so I just in
the middle what was your first stuffed
animal and its name it basically looks
like I abused her and raped her in every
single corner of her body but this was
my first stuffed animal
her name is poopy like she has no heart
anymore her face is all beaten up I
cannot throw her away
never what's the drink you always order
at Starbucks a skinny vanilla latte
what's the beauty rule you preach but
never actually practice I don't know
basically what I say is what I always do
I do not always apply you protect them
to my hair but I don't really do hair
tutorials um
I don't always curl my lashes which way
do you face in the shower okay with
questions like that my mind says who
gives a well I always like it's
just like if the water was coming from
that direction I would always stand like
this or this or this do you have any
weird body skills
what's your favorite comfort food the
food that's bad for you but you'll love
to eat it anyways I love my McDonald's
quarter pounder with beef and cheese
only I know that's a cheeseburger but
when you do it in the quarter pounder
way they always make it fresh
what's a phrase or exclamation you
always say a day without laughter is
like a day dead it's Dutch
I don't know time to sleep what are you
actually wearing I always wear really
really big t-shirts now I'm like my
perry the platypus
t-shirt that I got in New York um just a
really really big t-shirt that like
oversized like Timmy's or something and
then some shorts in summer and then in
the winter probably some longer um like
