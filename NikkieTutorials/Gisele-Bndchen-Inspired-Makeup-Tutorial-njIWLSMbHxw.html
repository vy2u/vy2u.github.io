foundation melts and mascara doesn't dry
hey guys I had some off time at my
amazing Swim Co Mexico shoot and I
decided to grab one of my models and do
a glowy Gisele Bundchen inspired makeup
look on her I hope you enjoy the first
thing I'm doing is applying a radiant
glowing base to my model skin and I'm
using my Becca shimmering skin Perfector
in moonstone over top of course some
foundation and I use my Mac face and
body in c-five and t7 because my model
has a lovely warm undertone
I love face and body for warm climates
as it is waterproof it just looks like
skin and it's amazing
for concealer I used my favorite for our
photo shoots the Estee Lauder Double
Wear maximum cover and I love this
because it stays where it's put it's
amazing and it looks beautiful in
pictures
I set my models face using black powder
by Mack
I'm taking next uninterrupted prolong
wear eye shadow one of my favorites and
this was truly an iconic color on the
shoots I'm taking that same color and
now applying it to the crease and
blending out
I left eyebrows bare to give a really
nice natural and almost bleached feel to
the look
so give the eyes a little bit more
definition and taking that same
uninterrupted color and a darker brown
and applying it to the inner corners of
my model's eyes close to the nose line
I'm not taking a matte dark brown
eyeshadow and darkening the crease up to
give it even more definition
on the lids I apply blondes gold pigment
by Mac one of my favorites
an over top on the middle of the list
I'm applying my makeup studio Joel
effects in shine I'm also playing that
same makeup studio jewel effects in
shine to the inner corners of the eyes
to give an amazing sparkle and glamour
all you want to do now to complete the
eyes is curled the eyelashes and follow
through with mascara
to get the perfect glowy beachy skin at
first bronzing up my model's face using
my lancome star bronzer in number three
i'm softly blaming this on the highest
points of her cheekbones temples
forehead and neck line
next up I go through with extra
dimensions skinfinish and glorified by
Mac and this to give the face even more
glow and bronze
for blush I used my favorite Mac
mineralized blush in dainty the perfect
loi blush and lastly to complete that
ultimate glow I'm again taking Mac's
pigment in blonds gold and applying it
to the highest points of my models face
and that are the cheekbones bridge of
the nose tip of the nose chin Cupid's
bow basically everywhere all you want to
do now it's a complete this Gisele
Bundchen inspired makeup look off is mix
two lip glosses together to get the
perfect nude lip and I'm using my NYX
butter glosses in Maple blondie and
creme brulee
so thank you guys so much for watching I
hope you enjoyed and hopefully I'll see
you guys on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
