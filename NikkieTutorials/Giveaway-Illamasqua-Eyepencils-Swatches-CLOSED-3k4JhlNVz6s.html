pencils that are my absolute favorites
so let's go ahead and let's do the smart
siliceous and then we will do the
giveaway at the content the first color
I have for you is Sophie and that is
their black color and Sophie is this is
my favorite pencil because it's black so
you can do anything with it again I made
a photo shoot with it and we did this
like grungy smokey eye it was
amazing and it blended like no other
that's the thing about these pencils
they go on really pigmented and really
creamy but they blend so nicely and once
you set them with an eyeshadow they're
not gonna budge or move the second color
I have for you is Devon Devon noir dem
anair debonair its a bright shocking
blue I love that color as well that is
debonair the next color I have is errant
and errant is like a dark greenish gray
it looks a lot like the black color but
as you can see it's a little bit more
greenish I have to trash which is a neon
orange I love this color you can do such
amazing
that I have 5 della T or fidelity and
it's a dark worm Brown
this also is one of my favorites too
dark mom Brown because you can do soft
smokey eyes with it then I have
sorceress and that is um also kind of
black it's like a greyish dark dark
brown that's almost black
I have hex and hex is a biscuit like a
skin tone color you almost cannot see it
right that can you see that like
skintone color then my absolute favorite
is a foul and foul it's a really nude
skin tone color and for really light
ladies like me I'm wearing it in my eyes
today it's I think white is really harsh
when you put it on the inner like the
inner rim of your eye it's just way too
you like and with a vow you can have
that that opening that it opens up the
eye but it's not too harsh it's really
natural I love it Rowdy which is a brick
color torment and torment is a sort of
red color it's red with its deep and red
Coke's and coaxes really fun as well as
I told in that Hall it's a light baby
blue and I've never seen a company do a
lie baby blue color interrogate and
interrogate is a medium brown and again
I love that for putting a little bit of
crease into your eye just a little bit
more definition Matic which is a really
really bright pink you can do omit it's
amazing for on the lips as well bait and
that is even more bright that is bait
they look really similar on camera but
trust me in real life bait is more neon
this is Titov ate another pink this is
more of a deep magenta pink then I got
paint and paint is a bright yellow this
is Kane and it's like a pastel
yellow and then the less color I have is
few late and you late is there white
