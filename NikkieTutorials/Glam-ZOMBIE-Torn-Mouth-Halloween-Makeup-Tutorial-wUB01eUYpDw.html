hey guys today I'm doing another
Halloween makeup tutorial this will
either be my last one or I might have a
last-minute one going up on Monday
definitely leave a comment down below or
give me a thumbs up so I know to do this
video on Monday for a last-minute fun
makeup look for Halloween I kind of
looked back at all my Halloween
tutorials this year and I saw a basic
theme which was red so why not conclude
or maybe not if I do the one on Monday
conclude this Halloween series by doing
another creepy red a glam zombie girl
with the torn up mouth she's missing a
couple of teeth she's bloody she's still
glam she got her lashes on she cried
with blood because she died it's just a
very fun look and I had so much fun
creating it for you guys I was inspired
by Jordan Hans the queen of Halloween
for me she did 31 days of Halloween she
uploaded a look like a strong look every
day for the month of October and I think
what she did was insane and I was so
inspired by her art so with her tips and
tricks I came up with this look and I
love Jordan so much so go ahead and
subscribe to her channel she's so
talented you will not regret it
but yeah but other than that I'm gonna
be this zombie glam girl and if you want
to know how I did it then keep on
watching already so the first thing I'm
gonna do is to map out where I want my
zombie zombie zombie some weird first
I'm gonna map out where I want my zombie
mouth torn up mouth um to go to so what
I wanted to look like basically for this
I'm using an eyebrow pencil you can use
whatever you want use a I call you can
even use whatever you want so I want to
keep it quite close to the mouth but a
little bit more torn up and and shredded
and the best thing about this is when
you don't like this shape you can just
wipe it away and do it again so like
that all right now I'm gonna go in with
foundation and I'm gonna make myself
look pegler if that is even possible I'm
gonna make myself look paler than I
already am to make myself look a little
bit more deadly and sickly and we have a
torn-up zombie mouth we we're not doing
all that great so what I'm going to be
using for that is the Make Up For Ever
Ultra HD foundation stick in 117 and
really really lightening it using the
Kryolan TV paint stick in double zero
and try not to touch your sketch too
much but if you do end up going over top
of it you can always go back and with a
pencil later
and now it is important to set this all
with powder and then we can rock this
all night long
now what I'm going to do is do my eye
makeup off-camera this will be my normal
glam self and we have a lot of tutorials
this year that went up that featured my
glam eye is this I'm going to do that
off camera to save time and then we'll
go to the fun part I'm going to use a
water activated paint for this this is
the mehron paradise palette it comes
with I believe 30 colors so the first
thing I'm gonna do is draw out my teeth
using white and just a little tiny bit
of yellow and as you get further to the
back of this mouthpiece you do want the
teeth to become smaller because of
course the further away you go the
smaller the teeth get I'm going to fill
out the rest of the mouth using a dark
red and with this you're going to create
the gums and with this you can also
shape the teeth a little bit nicer
now right underneath the teeth I'm going
to fill that up with red and follow with
black
here's a little trick for if you feel
like you totally messed up one tooth
just remove it you're a zombie you don't
need all your teeth so that's what I did
because I totally messed that one up
see how I'm really shaping and
perfecting the teeth with the black that
is sort of like your eraser and to fix
everything up now with a black shadow
I'm adding depth right up against the
line of the mouth
now I'm going to go in with makeup geeks
mocha to define the teeth and the
further you go back into your mouth the
more shadow the teeth get
and now with white I'm going to be
highlighting the teeth as well as the
mouth to make it look wet and gross
now of course we want to create shadow
around the mouth as if it looks torn
open and like a hot damn mess so that is
exactly what I'm gonna be doing using
Moka eye shadow by makeup geek
I'm gonna go into the modern renaissance
followed by Anasazi Beverly Hills and
taking Venetian red and with this one
kind of gonna add redness and stress
around my mouth
I'm going to be contouring using faux
fur by makeup geek and I want to really
fallen in skull-like feature so what
we're going to do is I'm going to come
up from here and then go up like this
and kind of follow along here same on
the other side
and the temples of course
deepening this using a little bit of
mocha again I swear this color Jordan
Hans oooh this color because of you
people know what to use to look
effectively dead alright quickly because
we'll be adding more blood towards the
end I think it will be fun to tighten
one eye with all this bloody mess by
doing a bloody tear coming from the eye
like she cried blood before she really
went there so I'm going back in with my
red face paint and a small little
eyeliner brush and I draw in a bloody
TIA
and then we're highlighting using white
again and a tiny bit of shadow using
mocha
alright now I'm going to go in with my
may run coagulated blood splatter it
around the mouth and this look should be
done
