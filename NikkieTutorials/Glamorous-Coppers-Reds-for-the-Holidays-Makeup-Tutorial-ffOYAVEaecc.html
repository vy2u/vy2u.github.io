hair clip I absolutely love it today I'm
going to do a tutorial on this very glam
copper look right here this is perfect
for like Christmas or like a Christmas
party I was super inspired by the Tom
Ford Beauty at for fall 2012 and um so
yeah if you want to know how to get this
look then please keep on watching okay
so the first thing I'm going to do is
prime my eyelids using a eyeshadow
primer and the ones I'm using our next
soft ochre Paint Pot and on the lid so
just on the lid and close to the lash
line only I'm gonna use quite natural
which is a sort of medium dark brown and
I also want to show you Larry and Steve
you can't see them right now but if I
tilt my camera up a little tiny teeny
tiny bit Larry and Steve everybody it
totally sucks because in my mirror right
here I could see them right behind me
it's like we're watching you and then in
the frame right here on camera you can't
see so yeah the first eyeshadow
we'll be using is Mac's copper ring and
this is going all over my lid and
because they're for dark base underneath
this is really going to pop for my
bottom lash line I'm going to use mix
embark with this I'm going to smoke out
my lower lash line
and I'm gonna go all the way in and out
then I'm going to take Mac's stars
eyelid and coppering together and mix it
to and I just kind of blend that
underneath your lower lash line to
really get that sort of smoked out
feeling and then darkening everything
again with embark eyes shadow then with
embark I'm going to go in sort of an
oval shape into my crease so this outer
part right here kind of looks like a
sort of really rounded C shape if you
don't see a c-shape in this that is
perfectly fine just try to see a C in
this if not you're just a human
being it is absolutely possible that you
don't see this ticking cork eyeshadow by
Mac I'm going to sort of blend out this
entire crease and make it look a little
bit more blended and warm taking just
the slightest bit of copper ring by Mac
I'm super softly going to blend that at
sort of the edges of my cork blend so
sort of above your cork and in between
your brows it is really lightly then I'm
darkening up my outer corners using
embark again taking a little bit of
carbon eyeshadow a Mac this is a matte
black one and I'm just going to sort of
put that above my lower lash line to
kind of give myself more depth so just
at sort of the outer third of your eye
brush um matte black eyeshadow and then
blend it out to give yourself a little
bit more of definition and depth quickly
highlighting my brow bone with Mac's
Blanc type I shadow for my inner corner
highlight I'm first gonna highlight with
my Mac blonds gold pigment and I'm going
on top with my favorite makeup studio
dual sex and shine I love this
and you want to keep that dual effect
and shine sort of really small and cute
on the inner corners and not too loud
and glittery look how did you effect a
China over me no this is not how I
wanted my night to end
ball crap crap the balls for my
waterline I'm going to use my NYX a
slide on pencil and brown perfection
okay I'm now going to curl my lashes and
apply mascara and the mascara is amusing
art my makeup studio waterproof 3d extra
black and the makeup studio ultimate
curl so I'll be right back
okay as usual first for cheeks
contouring with my NYX blush in taupe I
can't go without this I still don't get
how my face still hasn't absorbed sort
of this shape I'm like waiting for my
skin to finally absorb this line and
look skinny it's not working and then
you guessed it I'm warming up my face
with my blush by Illamasqua called dis
obey this is perfect for our snow-white
ladies like me for blush I'm going to
use one of my favorites this is I can
open it this is pink tea by Mac and then
just put it on them round parts that
come up and then to give myself a
beautiful glow I'm going to use my soft
and gentle mineralized skinfinish by Mac
as well and just right here yes and down
the nose okay for lips it's of course
completely up to you what you do now I
love these eyes I could go clubbing with
them I could have a Christmas party with
them I could have a New Year's Eve party
with them so these eyes are really
versatile you can do so many things with
them you can just go anything sort of
fun with them but because I wanted to
make this a little bit more festive I'm
going to add a red lip so I'm first
gonna pay my lips with a ruby will
lipstick by Mac Asad that is all I'm
going to do right now so I just put on
that lip
so sort of like this and then just do
the same on the top and then once you're
done you kind of have a look like this
um I really like this it's super um sort
of
it's smoky with a twist but really
festive and sort of verse it's hot as
well and if you're thinking Nicki are
you overdrawn your top loop again yes
