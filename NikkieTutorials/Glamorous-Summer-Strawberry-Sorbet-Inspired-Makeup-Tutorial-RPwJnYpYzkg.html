tutorial sort of inspired by an evening
survey look I don't know I was eating a
sorbet last week and I just loved the
strawberry sorbet color and I was like
I'm gonna make a look inspired by you
I love the list because those really
remind me of the survey and I love the
glittery evening smokey eyes so yeah
guys if you want to know how to get this
sorbet inspired look then please keep on
watching
so the first thing you want to do is to
play bass your eye lists you prevent the
eye shadow from creasing and the one I'm
using is Mac soft ochre Paint Pot the
first colors that we'll be using our mix
hoe not home like not hoe but as in
house and make it beats a Cinderella and
I'm going to start blending that into my
crease for definition I'm gonna go all
the way in
take a vision now it goes your pellet
and from the pillow I'm gonna use this
peachy light color I'm going to mix that
on the inner crease right here now
because that Chanel color shimmery I
want to bring some definition back into
the crease and for that I'm gonna use
makeup geeks goddess and just bring back
some definition where you applied that
Chanel color second Deschanel illusion
dome vision eyeshadow I'm just gonna
apply that with my pinky onto my lid and
I love the texture of this product
because it's a glittery and shimmery but
not in a like cheap way it's a really
luxurious sort of glitter shine and I'm
gonna set that with the lighter color of
that Chanel palette and together these
to make such an amazing combo it's a
really rich glimmering sort of lid but
still wearable so I love those who
Chanel protes together take it a bit of
next a fully eyeshadow and also be
enough that darkest color from the
Chanel palette I'm gonna run that along
the outer part of my lower lash line
just to give it a little bit of
definition and then go into your crease
in a round motion in a circle motion so
you do not want your outer crease your
outer part to be pointy
you want it to be round now of course
blend that part out as well and more
into the
please take those two colors again
running them along my lash line to give
some definition and also to darken up
this outer part right here taking a
little bit of Mex ho again I'm going to
blend that color on the outer part of my
lid and blend it in as a brow bone
highlight i will be using mixed
chamomile and vapour I'm not going to
take one of my all-time new favorite
products this is face front pigment in
vanilla chrome and this is an amazing
gorgeous highlight and I'm going to
apply that to my inner corners okay I'm
not just gonna play some eyeliner to my
waterline the one I'm using is the red
concealer number one and b3 neutralizer
cream crayon by Ben Nye Wow and for
mascara I am using my favorite makeup
studio waterproof 3d extra black and
then I will be back for they third that
lips
okay so for lips I am going to use one
of my new favorites Rouge I love Lancome
lipsticks I will be using number 377 N
and that's a really nice sort of berry
color I am gonna make it a little bit
more bright with 351 B and then a sort
of a bright coral color so let's just
start off by applying that lipstick that
is now all over my leg
it is so crapping hot in here
Jesus
you
some free chicks I first got a contour
bit with my NYX blush in taupe and then
warm it up afterwards with disobey blush
from Illamasqua for blush I'm using
Mac's
a lunch away and I'm going a little bit
more peachy and orangie because else
everything will look too pink as a
highlight I'm using Mac's extra
dimension skin finish in suburb and
that's because I love glowy dewy skin
you all know that so you guys that
completes this filter survey look I
don't know I'm calling it like that but
I just feel like these lips remind me of
surveys surveys surveys servants ice
cream so you guys think it gets so much
