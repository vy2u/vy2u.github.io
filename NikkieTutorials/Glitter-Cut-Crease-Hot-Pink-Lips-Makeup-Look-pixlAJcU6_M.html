on the latest look that pearl wore in
the latest episode of RuPaul's Drag Race
I absolutely loved what she did with her
eyes it is a glitter party it's a
glitter Palooza it is glitter all over
the eyes so this is great for like a
night out and you really want to steal
all the attention you want all eyes on
you with that glitter on your eyes I am
loving this let's just go right into
that tutorial because I'm so excited
okay so of course I were doing ahead and
did my base for my eyelids superb in
everything from creasing and now on to
the first eyeshadow the first I should
I'll be using is bone buy on the salsa
Beverly Hills and this color is
literally going everywhere you really
want to pack it on to the lid and then
sweep it up into the crease I'm going to
cut my crease using makeup geeks latte
and once you get to the outside you kind
of want to whisk it out you don't really
want to create a wing with it you don't
really want to do anything with it just
sweep it out now still using latte I'm
going to define and blend that out now
using makeup geeks mocha and
intensifying that so just at the base of
that new crease deepen it a tiny bit
more and create more definition now it's
time for the liner and for the line I'm
going to use a combination of Kevin YZ
tattoo liner in trooper and my NYC black
liquid liner and we're going to go for a
very thick and winged big huge eye liner
so first going to create a new serve
inner corner by making a little point
here and then from there it goes onto
the lid and woohoo make a wing
and make sure you fan that because you
don't want to look up with wet eyeliner
because you will be fudge I'm going to
go in with my been night sparklers they
call their glitter sparklers and this is
called silver prism and this is
literally going all over the lid above
the eyeliner all over the lower lash
line we're going to create a glitter
Palooza
and as my mixing medium I'll be using
the lid clearly liquid glitter base my
favorite
and again you want to fan that so it's
dry and you won't get any creases in
your glitter once you look up and like I
said I'm also playing the glitter on the
bottom
on the waterline I'm applying NYX jumbo
pencil in milk off-camera and to finish
off this glitter crazy look I of course
need some falsies and the lashes I'll be
using for this are the iconic lashes by
house of lashes alright for contouring
today I'll be using my Kevin E shade and
light contouring palette to bronze up my
skin out again is my L'Oreal glam bronze
in number one for blush I'll be using
pink coral by Bobbi Brown and just like
in the previous tutorial I did I'm not
going to take rose gold to wring the
skin Perfector by Becca and this is
going all over for a glow and then
taking moonstone to actually highlight
and give myself that glow
and that's it for the face for lips of
risk going in with color rain amazing
rain liquid lipstick and a little side
note on the 29th of this month of April
they are restocking I believe their
entire line and I hooked you guys up
starting from the 29th on the day that
they restock their entire line when you
