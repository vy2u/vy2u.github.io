this crazy look right here I've seen a
lot of double cut creases on Instagram
lately and I always wanted to do one but
never got around to doing it so today I
figured for episode number 4 of winter
1/2 week why not create a double cut
crease makeup look with lots of glitter
so it makes it perfect for the holidays
Christmas New Year's Eve national glow
day which is every day in my book so I
figured I wanted to do a double cut
crease glittery eye makeup look today
and then for lips I was like okay we
need a bit of color in my life today so
I opted for this crazy bright purple lip
look you can definitely go for a nude or
something safer or whatever you prefer
but I'm gonna go for purple because
purple makes my insides quiver it's true
see it without any further ado if you
want to know how to get this double cut
crease glittery eye look and bright pop
of purple on the lips
keep a watch and girl can watch it
alrighty the first products I'm going in
with is by Bobbi Brown and this is the
vitamin enriched face base and I'm using
it because of Jeffrey I watched Jeffrey
all morning he used this I got this from
Jeffrey so and I'm gonna apply that
using my Beauty Blender you just want to
scoop some of the product out and then
lather it on and I like this especially
because it's really nice for drier skin
and since it's winter here I am dry as a
Muslim desert I'm gonna need that
vitamin enriched face base so enriched
I'm gonna change things up a little bit
today I'm gonna go for my Ultra HD a
foundation by Makeup Forever in fluid
and mixing it with Born This Way and
with my Beauty Blender I'm just gonna
dot all over my face so we get even
coverage all over the face and then
start buffing it in with that same
hair-do blender start tapping all this
in
for concealer today I'll be using the
naked skin by urban decay and I'm in the
color fair neutral
and now that you look like a clown just
start tapping some more it's like you're
giving your face and mini massage with
all the padding and bouncing you're
doing
and then quickly setting that with
powder to prevent it from creasing
and sing it with me dolls bake bake bake
bake all day bake all day but dog ticket
read this all right let's do this first
I'm gonna do prime using my soft ochre
Paint Pot by Mac as always with a matte
nude eyeshadow I'm setting my crease in
brow bone area to help blending later on
with makeup geeks eyeshadow in bedrock
I'm going to map out where it will my
new crease to be plus outline my
existing crease
and then once you've got that outline a
little bit above your crease you want to
create a little gap and make a line
parallel to the line you just created
now with a sigma e45 and this shadow
from the Too Faced chocolate bonbons
palette I'm blending the crease out a
little bit more now with makeup geek
americano and some black eye shadow I'm
not a darkened the outer third of my
actual lid
and now with an angled brush and some
black eyeshadow I'm just going to
Crispin up the lines I'm going to fill
up the remaining part of my lid using
this Urban Decay eye shadow in dark
force
that's time to focus on this line in
between I'm going to fill it up using a
shimmering white eyeshadow and with this
you can also correct the shape a little
bit
and I'll also really softly give the
base of that new crease a little bit
more depth
time to glitter it up I'm first going in
with this Urban Decay heavy metals
litter liner in gunmetal and this is
going on the black portion
on the center portion I'm a playing
Midnight Cowboy
and on the inner third glam rock
now you want to let this dry and then we
can focus on the lower lash line for the
lower lash line I'm going to smoke it
out using americano by makeup geek
and then intensifying it with some black
eye shadow
and lastly with a matte bright cream
color I'm highlighting my inner corner
and to finish off the look all you need
are some falsies and these are Brigitte
by Hooda beauty
all right so let's do some sculpting I'm
going to go in with my NYX blush in
taupe and my morphe and five-thirty
brush
to give my face a little bit more warmth
and going in with the milk chocolate
bronzer by Too Faced and the mac 135
brush and for everyone saying the 135 is
similar to the morphe m 527 you're wrong
I mean look at the difference the morphe
one is so fluffy dense and like a little
bit faddish and then the Mac one is so
slim look do you see the difference so
for everyone saying they're an exact
dupe no all right now on to that
magnificent glow so I'm gonna mix
Becca's pearl with Anasazi Berkeley
Hills starlight and together it's like a
low-key pearl not as intense but still
very very nice I'll be using of course
my morphe M 310 brush and if you use
code Nikki you can get a discount I'll
hook you okay I'm not holding back now
hello mama we're home and I'm a Jew a
Jeffrey starch day Jeffrey brings it all
the way back to the hairline on the
follow that today let's highlight that
snob Jung snow and then with a damp
morphe M 510 I'm picking up starlight
only and with this I'm going to
highlight my Cupid's bow and a little
bit above it okay that's a little bit
too much Who am I kidding no that's
never too much and then also a little
bit on the sides of the lip and what
that will do is once you put lipstick on
it will really make a pop trust and now
it's time to blend some blush in to make
it all come together and the blushes
I'll be using are this or a powder by
Sigma in pet name and this powder blush
by Sigma in hotspot
and now it's time for the lips and with
these lips you can do whatever you want
you can go for super nude peachy nude
curly nude bright purple red peach
bright red bright but you can do
whatever you want to do with these eyes
so first I'm going in with the velour
liquid lipstick by Jeffrey star and this
is in the color I'm royalty
hello pigmentation these lipsticks are
so freakin pigmented it's blowing my
mind
and they're right in the center to give
it a little bit of a pop blow pony and
that guy's concludes his double cut
crease glittery holiday makeup glam with
a pop of bright purple on the lips for a
