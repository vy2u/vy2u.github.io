hey guys today I'm doing this makeup
look right here I don't even know how
this happened I went into this tutorial
completely blank and I just kind of let
my hands do to talking and then rainbow
liner glitter and warm tones came out
what is the prize so today I'm showing
you how to get these peach pink smokey
eyes with glitter and rainbow liner I
must say I really really like this look
I love how it came out so yeah if you
want to know how to get this artsy
fartsy look right here then please keep
on watching as always the first thing
I'll be doing is applying a base to my
lids to prevent everything from creasing
plus making everything brighter so
therefore I'm taking the Mac soft ochre
Paint Pot and I'm applying this with a
zoeva 142 the first eyeshadow will be
going in with is by honest Elsa Beverly
Hills and this is called Morocco and
with my makeup geek defined crease brush
I'm applying this to the outer and inner
corners of my eyelid
now blending Morocco into orange soda
also by anastacio and that is going to
be my blending color and the brush I'm
using is the morphe m4 33 so really
softly you just want to start blending
out that Morocco shade and create some
depth in your crease then very lightly
drag it towards the entire crease so
we're filling up that gap here really
lightly and then little by little you
can pick more up of that Morocco shade
and intensify the color on the center of
the lid I'll be applying fresh peach all
the way on the south of Irbil hills and
I'll be applying this with a damp brush
and the brush I'm using is a Mac 242 for
the lower lash line I'm again going in
with Morocco and with my Mac 228 I'm
applying this to inner and outer corners
for the center of the lower lash line
I'm taking these two pink colors right
here from the morphe 35 you palette and
again that is going on the center
for the inner corners I'm taking that
same morphe palette and taking the
shimmering whites and applying this with
a morphe 36 now it's time for the
eyeliner so first I'm going in with my
cavity tattoo liner in trooper to make
my outline but we're going to keep the
actual wing part of the wing bare
because we're filling that up with color
I have to look down because my eyeliner
will stay my crease but the first
eyeliner I'll be using in the little gap
is by unsightly Hills this is the
waterproof cream color in Barbie pink
now I'm going to go in with the yellow
and don't worry if you make a mess
because you can always go back in with
the black and lastly the blue and this
is called the ice blue on the center of
my waterline I'm applying ocean blue and
then lastly on the center of the lid
some glitter this is the Urban Decay
heavy metal glitter liner in Midnight
Cowboy
now I'm going to apply some mascara and
again I can't look up because the
glitter is driving the lashes I'll be
applying today are these by house of
lashes and these are called boudoir so I
just want to keep the rest of the face
very bronzy and glowy and summery so all
the attention goes to these eyes
so first I'm bronzing up my face using
the mineralized skinfinish by Mac called
give me son
they're just a little bit of contouring
using my Kat Von D shade and light
palette for highlighter I'm going to use
gerard cosmetics the star powder in
audrey and then over top a little bit of
mary loumanizer
and for blush she is back Luminoso she's
back from her fake a you know she needed
her time demanding too much attention oh
is it good to have you back for lips on
first lining them using my NYX natural
lip pencil for lipstick I'm going to use
dose of colors poise lipstick
and over top a little bit of coy
lipstick
and that guy's concludes this I don't
know
