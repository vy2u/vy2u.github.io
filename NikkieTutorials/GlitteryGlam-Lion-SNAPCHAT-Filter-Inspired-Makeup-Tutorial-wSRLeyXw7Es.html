lately is snapchat and if you have me on
there by username nikkietutorials you
know that I like to kind of show stuff
of my life and like behind the scenes
like tips and tricks and just all kinds
of fun stuff and one of my favorite
things about snapchat are their filters
/ lenses and if you ask me they kill
that department because they come up
with such original cool content and just
sometimes the lenses or the filters are
just so good that it inspires me to do
something with my day to day life in a
snapchat manner and a couple weeks ago
they came out with the glitt'ring
dragged up lion tiger cat Spees cat
species the felinus nobody knows and I
was that has to be a makeup tutorial so
I thought today I'm gonna bring snapchat
filters into the real life and this
might actually turn out to be a very
cool serious because I plan on doing
these more in the future I know everyone
on YouTube is doing them right now but
you know what
so am i yeah without any further ado if
you would like to know how to get that
tiger that glittering drag tiger filter
snapchat filter in real life on your
face they keep on watching alright let's
do it so the first thing you want to do
is the PI Foundation and concealer kind
of I feel like this is a nice barrier to
get the glitter off easier because if
you apply the glitter straight to your
skin trust and believe is going to be a
hard time getting that off again and the
foundation I'll be using today is by
Ofra and this is the absolute cover
foundation in number and then with my
Beauty Blender I'm just going to dot
around my face to distribute the product
and once we have done that we're going
to start tapping it in
people always tend to kind of freak out
when using a darker foundation we know
what if you use a lighter concealer to
counteract there's no problem because
after that it's all balanced out now if
you would go darker foundation and
darken concealer we got a talk because
it's got a match
so when you do that make sure you add
your neck any piece of flesh that is
sticking out has to be that color if not
we don't have talked so for concealer
I'm going to use the kyln TV paint stick
and double-0 to highlight and conceal
and with your Beauty Blender start
tapping it in
now some baking underneath the eyes all
right so I quickly went ahead and did my
brows and now it's time to work on these
feline eyes as always first thing I'm
going to do is prime is my Mac soft
ochre Paint Pot and there wasn't really
a lot going on on the eyes except for
that big-ass eyeliner so I'm going to
make a little spin on it I'm going to
add a couple of shimmers a little bit of
structure and make it a little bit more
my own so as the base I'll be using
tension eyeshadow by motives all over my
lid and going over top using this
pigment by donessa Marik's and these are
the enlight pigments and this is called
a rat of radiance right over top and a
little bit of structure right in that
crease and blending it high up and
outside for that crazy eyeliner what you
want to do is go very high up and now
almost cover the entire lid come back in
create a point and become a tigress or
whatever we agreed on so I'm going to
use my ardency in punker rock on what
aprove liquid liner
and of course extend that inner corner
filling this bad boy in alright time to
hit that bottom okay so for the bottom
from that top line you want to connect
it to the lower lash line drag it in
here and then create an inner feline
point mm-hmm then drag it across the
lash line
and then right here on that outer corner
it drops down a little bit some like
that now let me do the other eye so the
little twist I'm gonna add to this I
look is apply some crazy-ass drag lashes
I felt like what this lens with this
filter it was so good yet one thing that
was really missing for me were just so
I'm gonna put on these 301 lashes and
the 300 ones are very well-known in the
drag culture Bianca Del Rio
where is about six to nine pairs of
these on her top lashes I'm gonna keep
it at one maybe two today on top after
the lower lash I'm going to add these
cream eyelashes in 8:05
and out of nowhere this also became my
Nexus summon of my RuPaul's Drag face
series this week's challenge was the
Wizard of Oz well here you go the dots
Oh Cowardly Lion that's time to
transform our nose and again going in
with eyeliner so the first thing that
really stood out to me was this line
right here in the center going down so
I'm going to add that first and so far
for this entire tutorial I've been
filling everything in using my Ofra gel
liner and I love this stuff as for the
rest of the nose you just want a black
line going like this kind of looks like
a uterus if you ask me and of course
there's some extra and I want this to be
a little bit more drag I'm going to
contour my nose a tiny bit even though
it doesn't need it but still
now you want to add some dots here for
your whiskers which we're not going to
add so we're just going to give it a
dots okay I'm just going to contour my
face we might be a snapchat filter but
we still want to be able to cut a bitch
so using my favorite morphe brush the m5
30 and Kevin Kwan medium sculpting
powder I'm just going to cut this face
and now it's time for the lips and the
first color you want to go in with is by
coloured raine and this is in the color
Tootsie and going over top using
Geoffrey stars unicorn blood and we're
mainly focusing on the top lip and and
the bottom lips just left out
and anything that's left on my bottom
lip I'd just blend out with a brush
alright so now it's time for the moment
you've all been waiting for the gold
atom but first before I do that I need a
bitch in glow I'm going to use Anastasio
Beverly Hills sunburst to glow me up and
as always I'll be using my favorite
highlighting brush the morphe M 310 and
since you want the glitter to go on kind
of dusty and kind of like a fairy and
not too concentrated in some spots I'm
going to spray my face lightly with a
strong hold hairspray and once it's
still damp I dazzle the glitter over top
and that way it's nicely distributed and
gives you that perfect litter look I
give it one last spray to lock it in for
the night and the guys includes to
