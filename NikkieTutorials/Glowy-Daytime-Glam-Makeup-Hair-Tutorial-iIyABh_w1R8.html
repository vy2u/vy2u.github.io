thought why not go natural
glowy lashy nude free hair just go
natural today I felt like doing this
super wearable easy to do natural makeup
look that's super glowy and I think very
flattering plus I also included how I
got this very free curly hair I really
this is how thin styling my hair lately
yeah I have some great discount codes
for you at the end of this video so make
sure you please stay tuned and if you
want to know how to get this then please
stay tuned
alright so to get myself started today
I'm first going in with the Dior glow
Maximizer and it's just an illuminating
base and that is exactly what I want for
this look because I want to know like an
angel oh dear oh that's a globe now for
foundation I thought really long and
hard on this and this look today is more
of a soft look but still I want my base
to look on fleek and I've gotten a lot
of comments that my basis.sometimes too
perfect but you know what I'd rather
have my base looking perfect then not so
perfect
so today I'm going to make a mixture of
my benefit hello flawless foundation in
am pure foreshore ivory and just to give
it a little bit more I'm going to take
the Kryolan TV paint stick in G 191 so
first I'm going in with the benefit
foundation and then wherever I need more
I apply the Kryolan TV paint stick
then now go ahead and highlight today
I'm going to use my Mac Pro Longwear in
NC 15 and my Creole on TV pain stick in
406 to highlight but if you feel like a
lot of foundation plus concealer is too
much for you then by all means skip that
do you you do you I'm going to do me
and now quickly setting everything with
powder so it won't crease so now going
to quickly do my brows and one eye
off-camera and that it will be back okay
so far ice we're going to keep this very
easy quick and simple and SIL little bit
glamorous and lashes so as always the
first thing I'm doing is priming my
eyelids to prevent any creasing from
happening and for this I'm using my soft
ochre Paint Pot by Mac then from my tart
tart lip Ellen I'm going to take this
color right here and I'm applying the
shade of right into my crease and up to
my brow bone and what this will do is it
will help blend out the crease colors
that will place on later it will help
limp those out easier and smoother so
from the same palette I'm going to go
into wonderer and with this I'm just
going to start defining the outer parts
of my crease a little bit more just to
get more definition and depth so right
into the crease focus applying wonderer
and bring it in about halfway in now my
eye shape greatly benefits from a
rounded outer corner but if your eyes
benefit from a v-shaped outer corner by
all means do that so I'm going to drag
the brown on to my outer corner and
round it out then picking up a little
bit more of wanderer on a big blending
brush we're just going to diffuse and
blend out this define Monteux harsh now
and we want it to be soft and hazy for
the lid I'm using colourpop's EXO super
shock shadow and for some extra glam
over top I'm applying the the balm over
shadow whatever in a no money no honey
it's a pigment and right over top EXO
just for some extra glam and shine I
don't want to go too far with the lower
lash line so I'm ghent taking that
crease color and really slightly
defining the
roots of my lower lashes and then to
open up the eyes and give that as a
wide-awake feel I'm taking my Ben Nye
neutralizer cream crayon and that is
going on the waterline all right to
finish at the eyes all you need is some
mascara on your top lashes only if you
prefer mascara on your bottom lashes
also then by all means go ahead and do
that
I find that my eyes look more natural
without anything on the lower lashes so
I'm going to do that and falsies I want
it to be super lashy so I'm going to go
with the siren lashes by house of lashes
to give the eye a fun and unique look
I'm going to take a little bit of black
eyeshadow and a really tiny tiny teeny
brush I'm going to place that right here
where the lash stops right next to the
roots of my lower lashes to the inner
point of my eye so to speak and then
once I reach that inner corner I drag it
out a little bit as if you would do an
inner corner cat point like with the
Arabian style smokey eyes and then just
leave that line there and it just makes
your eyes look so cat-like and defined
and I really like this for cheeks today
I want to keep it soft glowy and very
flushed so first I'm going to contour
just a tiny teeny bit using heroine eyes
shadow by Illamasqua then to warm up my
complexion a little bit I'm taking my
Mac refined golden bronzer for blush
today I'm using Bobby Brown's pink coral
just to give that flesh that pop of
cheek if we're highlighter of course
Becca shimmering skin perfecter pressed
and moonstone let's go to glowy
up in heal
Philips the first using maxilla pencil
in boldly bear just to give myself a
little bit more depth and volume and
then for lipgloss I'm making a mixture
with honest Asda Beverly Hills lip
glosses the new lip gloss is amusing too
I'm using a dainty and undressed and
together this is like the perfect nude
gloss it's so everything
so I'm putting dainty on my top lip and
undressed on the lower lip and then to
mix them all you want to do is smack
them lips together girl and that
concludes the makeup now on to the hair
so for my hair today I'm using the new
new me titan-3 curling iron set it comes
with three curling wands
this is the medium wand this is the
small and of course we got our big one
so it comes to three ones and today I'm
going to start off by using the medium
sized curling wand I actually used it to
curl the hair of my model for a campaign
to it yesterday and it rocked my socks
off I created such a full glamorous
voluminous hairdo for that shoot using
this curling set and why not used it in
my video today and not only do I think
it is an absolute great quality but the
fact that it has three ones it's perfect
for beginners out there because you
don't have to buy three separate curling
irons it also comes with a heat
protectant glove if you're not used to
curling hair with one of these curling
wands this is great because I actually
burned to my finger because I forgot to
put the glove on step with the glove on
it heats up to 200 Celsius degrees which
is hot so again use the glove and
there's a little push the button right
here and that will release the wand so
I'm going to go for the medium one so
I'm taking the medium one and then you
just click it on so I'm just going to go
ahead and give myself some soft waves
today so we're just going to part a
little section of hair
quite a ticket brush it's the hand that
is curling the hair around the curling
wand should have the glove on it hold it
like this and then I wrap the hair
around and then I bring it all the way
to the ends and keep it there so I'm not
starting all the way at the roots I'm
really just curling the ends and I'm
just letting to sit for about 10 seconds
and then for the section of hair right
in front of it so the new section we
grab you want to curl it inwards so we
go from outwards inward away from the
face to the face away from the face to
the face so wrap it across all the way
to the end and hold it Noemie also has
some awesome discount codes for you for
40% of all the hot tools excluding hair
care accessories and seasonal items plus
a free argan oil use the code lovely
spring on new Me's website and for $100
off any curling one set you have to use
the discount code makeup lover and that
again will take $100 off any curling
wand set the know what I like to do is
tease the overall entire head because I
have a big head I want big hair so I'm
just going to tease this all to give
myself volume and then brush the curls
out and we should be done oh my let's
chain this a voila
and that guy's concludes this natural
