on this makeup look right here and this
is one of those classic Christmas makeup
looks I asked everyone on Twitter what
we still really wanted to see this
winter wonder week and I got so many
comments saying gold eyes rat lips and I
believe gold and red are the first two
colors so you immediately think of when
doing Christmas makeup so today I
decided to get glam and do the super fun
gold smokey eye with of course glitter
and then this awesome matte red lip and
super glowy skin of course so yeah if
you would like to know how to get this
makeup look right here perfect for the
holidays then please keep on watching
the first product I'll be going in with
today is by Kiehl's
and this is the ultra facial moisturizer
and this is also what a Kylie Jenner's
makeup artist uses on her so why not on
me and especially because my skin is
very dry from all the makeup from winter
Wonder week I be dating and following
through using some Smashbox photo finish
primer water oh yeah
wearing a hoodie Katie because the yo
Katie for foundation today I really like
the combination I used in my video
before yesterday and that was my Born
This Way and makeup for ever ultra HD
fluid my 2:15 in the Ultra HD and ivory
in Born This Way and just like last time
start dotting the foundation onto the
face and then after buff it in even say
a beauty blender
for concealer I'll be using by by under
I buy a cosmetics in the color light
and again blend in
using the beauty blender
now I'm going to set everything with
powder to prevent it from creasing it
shouldn't come as a surprise that the
first problems I'll be using from eyes
is the Mac soft ochre Paint Pot now
setting my brow bone in crease area with
a Mac no shadow to help blending later
on the first eyeshadow will be going in
with is orange soda that Anasazi Beverly
Hills with an Anasazi of Beverly Hills
blending brush I'm applying that to the
crease I think you guessed it by now but
this will be our transition shade I love
this color so much
with makeup geeks Coco bear I start
defining the inner and outer corners of
my lid and furthest I'm using a sigma
e30 for
you
I'm going to connect them here right in
the center of the crease with a morphe m
507 I'm just going to blend out the
edges I'm going to darken those edges
using a Murano by makeup it cosmetics
you
and then again softly connect them in a
bit please
on the centre of the lid of using this
foiled eyeshadow by makeup geek and this
is called untamed
you
then of course you know I can't handle
myself I need a little bit of glitter
this is the Urban Decay heavy metal
glitter liner in Midnight Cowboy
I'm going to highlight the inner corners
using mac's nylon eyeshadow with a Mac
228 I'm applying cocoa bear by makeup
geek again to my lower lash line and I'm
only going about half way in with this
and then with makeup geeks magic act
I highlight the tear duct area and of
course that also needs a little bit of
glitter and all you want to do now is
finish off with the lash and this is
House of lashes smoky lash
on two cheeks so the first thing of
course we need a little bit of
contouring and for this I'll be using
the NYX blush and oh my morphe and let's
start to give my face more warmth milk
chocolate bronzer by two faiths my
favorite and a new brush this is the
zoeva 90 brush remember how I talked
about that morphe brush not being
exactly like the Mac brush so we got
another contestant and still the zoeva
one is a lot thicker but it's a whole
lot more like the Mac one than the more
feet one
for my highlighter today I'll be going
back to an old favorite of the bombs the
bones mary-lou manizer and of course my
m through 10 brush
this is just a tiny bit more casual than
pearl
pearls like in your face Kabam pow
highlighter it's like highlighter
choking you and taking you to
highlighter heaven and Mary Lou's like
the tone down older sister knowing more
about life for blush I'm going to take
this zoeva coral spectrum blush palette
and I'm going to make a mixture between
these three shades right here yep all
three and that is going right between
the contour and the highlighter and kind
of blending it all together to make it
yeah okay mm-hmm keep going before lips
up first going in with unicorn blood
velour liquid lipstick by Jeffrey star
because it's awesome
every time I play with these I'm so
amazed at how amazing this formula is
and I'm not saying this because Jeffrey
is my friend but I honestly do believe
that Jeffrey star has one of the best
liquid lipsticks on the market now on
the center to make it a little bit more
bright I'll be using Anna Nicole like
that and that guys includes this classic
