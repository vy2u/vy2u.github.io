on Arizona Robbins from Grey's Anatomy
and this is actually a collab with jf
chumhum's bus a day here on YouTube he
is like one of my best friends on the
internet and also in real life we're
going to New York together in April and
we're going to IMATS New York normally
we do all these crazy looks together and
we decided to do something natural this
time today I am going to do Arizona
Robbins and he is going to be my
girlfriend which is Kelly from Grey's
Anatomy I've been putting a lot of like
really extreme looks out there lately
so this is definitely something more
toned down again definitely go check out
jf the link is in the infobox below and
also somewhere in the screen and if you
want to know how I got this look then
please keep watching
so as always the first thing you want to
do is apply a base to your eyelids to
prevent that actually from creasing and
the one I'm using is stuffed ochre Paint
Pot from Mac and then also along the
lash line I'm gonna use a little bit of
mixed PowerSearch eye Kohl just to give
it a little bit more of a like like the
gold touch the gold surgeon touch I'm
just taking a bit of PowerSearch eye
Kohl and just really smugly blend that
along the lash line this hasn't has to
be neat at all now take mix soba
eyeshadow and this is going all over the
lid and into the crease this is going to
be the main color of this look slightly
blended up into your crease now I'm
gonna take mix kit eyes shadow and mix
it with soba again and first just start
softening this crease up and while you
do that go further up into the socket
bone as well like that the brow bone
socket bone wow we're getting so British
today and just really softly blend it up
take your time I'm gonna take kid only
and this is going on like the upper part
of your crease are really onto your brow
bone as well and really making it soft
and lend it out and natural I'm quickly
going to take a bit of soba and then run
that around the outer part of the eye
and then blend that and meet it with the
top part
this is naked pigment from Megan this is
awesome I love this we're blending that
onto the inner corner of the eye and
then blended on to the lid and more into
the crease as well and just for fun
applied on the bottom inner corner as
well nimbala knit through for some nice
healthy glow around those eyes and last
but not least I'm gonna take a little
teeny bit of mixed quark eyeshadow and a
really softly darken the crease up a bit
for a little bit more definition it
won't show up as
because soba and cork are really close
together but just that really tiny bit
helps a lot for my waterline I'm going
to take Ben Nyes neutralizer cream
crayon and light and peat you and just
align your waterline with this this is a
really nice skintone color so it really
opens up the eyes and now all you want
to do is curl your lashes with your
eyelash curler I'm gonna use my shoe and
we're one and the player favorite
mascara to your top lashes only and the
one I'm using is my favorite favorite
favor bit this is makeup studios where
to proof extra deep black you can use
lashes for this look it will make it a
little bit more glamorous a little bit
more porn no not porn no surgeons don't
do porn
or do they
okay for Arizona's lips they normally
are like a neutral pinky toned color for
that I'm going to use a couple of
products the first thing I'm going to
use is Nyx's dolly pink lip pencil and
I'm just gonna use that as like a stain
on my lips now I'm gonna mix a bit of
this Inglot collar with that bright pink
one and just a really really tiny bit of
that bright pink one Pat it over on top
and then for just a tiniest bit of Sheen
I'm gonna use this sleek Monte Carlo or
Mundi Carlo lip balm and just a really
teeny bit and Pat that over as well and
that completes your Arizona Robbins
greats an enemy inspired makeup tutorial
I absolutely love her I love her on the
show I love that character I love the
actress so yet this is definitely like
this is wearable right because sometimes
I do tutorials and I call them wearable
or natural or neutral and I got like
tons of comments like this is not
natural and I'm like and what is it so
yeah for a fullness of every single
product use got some website- toriel's
