so today I'm doing another Grammys
inspired makeup tutorial after my video
yesterday on Lady Gaga I got a lot of
requests for Gwen Stefani and it happens
to be so that Gwen Stefani was my number
two favorite makeup look of the evening
number three was Katy Perry I figured
this look is perfect for Valentine's Day
it's perfect for like a date because you
got that really nice flirty winged
eyeliner nude Nizam the phase Newton is
on the lips and it's just a really
appropriate date night makeup look I
figured why not kill two birds with one
stone never kill birds please don't kill
birds birds are good but why not kill
two birds with one stone by doing the
Gwen Stefani look that a lot of people
want to see and then also it's perfect
for like a Valentine's Day date night
look see without any further ado if you
want to know how to get this Gwen
Stefani
Valentine's date night inspired makeup
look then please say tour top alright
guys so as always the first thing I'll
be doing is applying a base to prevent
everything from creasing and I'm using
my soft ochre Paint Pot which is almost
done and with a zoeva 142 just buffing
this into my lids the first crease color
I'll be using is warm taupe by Anastasia
Beverly Hills and the brush I'm using
for this is a zoeva 227 you first want
to focus on the outer half of your lid
so actually placing the brush onto the
lid and then from there you want to
flick it into the outer crease right
here and then start blending it out and
diffusing that color
as you're blending it out you can see
that it's starting to build a definition
and it's starting to shape the eye then
taking a massage a Beverly Hills nude
and then blending this lightly above the
brown that we just placed and also
towards the inner crease right here so
the new color is really really light but
it still gives the tiniest bit of
definition on my fair skin tone for the
living to take this amazing BH Cosmetics
a wild child palette I am loving this
and the color I'll be using for my lid
is this white shimmery color here and
this pinky color up top and with a Sigma
F 70 I'm just placing that onto my lids
and I am obsessing over this color right
here is just such a vivid glamorous nude
color I love this BH palette they come
in three types and the wild child is my
favorite because it's got all these
nudie colors and the pinky in the purple
and the peachy is a great great palette
and they look awesome applied dry but I
will apply a color to my lower lash line
wet damp and it's just out of this world
chrome heaven it's amazing
to warm up my outer-v a little bit more
I'm taking this new color pop super
shock cheek in Swift and just a tiny bit
of that goes again on that outer corner
and this is to bring in some warmth for
the lower lash out I'm going to take
this color right here and apply it with
a damp brush and then immediately right
after with a dry brush go over top with
that same color and that will sort of
kick it up really nicely and that will
give it that super awesome chrome finish
to further highlight the inner corners
I'm taking this em cosmetics calligraph
e liquid liner in scribble and this is
going right on the very inner corner and
then quickly when it grab a brush and
blend out the edges for my liquid liner
today I'm using my Kat Von D tattoo
liner in trooper and we just want to
create a classic cat eye winged eyeliner
so you want to start out by creating a
line that is going towards the end of
your eyebrow tail and then from that
line go back on to the lid then what I
like to do now is draw on the inner part
of my eyeliner and then I'm using my NYC
black liquid liner to fill this all in
and with that I'm also going to slightly
extend my wing a little bit and that's
it for the eyeliner what I'm not going
to do is open up my eyes by using a nude
light-colored eye pencil this is the Ben
Nye neutralizer cream crayon in ultra
light and I'm just going to pop this
onto my waterline I'm gonna be out of
frame because this is impossible to do
on camera now all that is left to do is
to finish off the eyes by using a lick
of mascara and I'm using my makeup
studio waterproof 3d in extra black and
for lashes I think Gwen wore the exact
same styles as I'm going to use right
now the house of lashes ikonics just
take a look at the pictures but Gwen's
lashes look exactly like these ones
alright let's go on to cheeks now for
the cheeks I have another great BH
Cosmetics product I went on a little bit
of a splurge I got the forever nude
sculpt and glow contour highlight and
blush palette I got this because it's
our Carli bybel use it here on YouTube
whatever she uses on that goddamn pretty
face of hers I need so this is a palette
that has two contouring shades one on
the cooler side one on the more pinky
rosier warmer side a blush color a sort
of banana shade to highlight the under
eye area for darker skin tones and a
highlighter so I'm going to dip right
into that cool toned contour shade and
I'm just going to contour my cheeks with
this Chalker
then for blush I'm going to go into the
new colour-pop cosmetics a super shock
cheek and this is trickery one of my
favorite shades it's such an icky color
I love this so I'm just picking a little
bit of that up with my Bobbi Brown
a sheer powder brush and just on one
side and then with the flat side I blush
of my face oh my god I love this color
so much and to highlight I'm going back
into that BH peled and I'm taking this
color right here which is a very nice a
shimmering light silvery pink I'm going
to place that right on the tops of my
cheekbones oh I love this color hello
now that is gorgeous I love that okay
then I'm also going to put it on the
bridge of my nose right here in that
little dent and then also keep its bow
oh hello new favorite highlighter this
is stunning okay for lips I'm first
going to line my lips using two lip
pencils the ones I'll be using are my la
girl endless lip liner in natural and
also to darken it up a bit a strip down
by Mac then I'm filling my entire lips
in using the la girl endless auto lip
liner in nude again and then to kick
that lip up a little bit more and give
it a little hint of pink because the
Gwen definitely had a little bit of pink
on the center I'm going to take this
another BH product the notes flirt so
I'm going to take the BH Cosmetics color
lock a lipstick in charming and this is
going right in the center
and then to give my lips a glass I'm
going to use the LMS cashier lip gloss
in exquisite
and then you have 3d plump lips
and that guy's concludes my Gwen Stefani
at the 2015 Grammys inspired makeup
tutorial I love this look so much I
think I might like it more than my Gaga
