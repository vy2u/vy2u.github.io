and I am here hey guys so today I have a
very very exciting video for you because
hooda Beauty came out with a brand new
foundation so after lashes she moved on
to lipsticks after lipstick she moved on
to highlighters eyeshadows and now we
have landed upon the world of hooda
Beauty foundations and the foundation is
called folk filter foundation so I've
got the foundation right here and it
comes in a very sleek plastic bottle and
it has a lid and it has a pump now
supposedly this foundation is Instagram
skin in a bottle so think full coverage
semi matte long-lasting and just
perfection in one go
because everyone on instagram has
perfect skin hashtag no face here
hashtag not me so I received the
foundation from the Hooda Beauty PR a
couple of days ago and I really wanted
to put it to the test and I have done
first impressions on foundations and I
have done so many stuff with foundations
and I love foundations but I feel like
when I'm talking about a foundation I
want you guys to know all the ins and
outs I want you guys to know all the
little details I want you guys to know
everything so I've been testing this
foundation for a good two to three days
now this is going to be my fourth and
hmm you better sit down get ready cuz
this is gonna be a fun ride for once so
yeah but that I knew further ado let's
take you right to the application I'm
gonna show you how I like applying this
foundation the most how I find it to
last the longest and then I'm gonna show
you what it looks like after twelve
hours of wear so sit back relax and
let's get glammed alright so welcome to
what we call the bare truth of my face
in this launch were three products first
of all was the Hooda beauty complexion
perfection pre makeup basis this is a
foundation primer I've been testing this
out let's just get it out there it it
adds moisture and that's it moisture
that's it
well sure and that's it when wearing
this primer over the last couple of days
I didn't notice it making the foundation
last any longer I've tried it with
different foundations and overall it's
it just adds a nice touch of moisture
what I look for in a primer is
stickiness because I feel like the
stickier the primer the more foundation
is gonna adhere to it and this did not
have all that much stickiness to it so
to me it's just nice for if you have
drier skin to give you that moisture but
for longevity or for stickiness or for
any of that also launched was the face
buff and blend brush this brush is
specially designed to go with the
foundation to apply flawlessly if you
know me any longer than just today you
know that I hate hate hate brushes for
foundation application with a passion
because for me it just always ends up
looking streaky it always ends up
looking wrong and it doesn't blend with
the skin nicely so you guessed it I
don't think the brush is worth it if you
love applying your foundation with the
brush by all means try this it's a good
brush it's a good brush it's dense it
feels soft
it looks soft it applies soft but
brushes and me for foundation is another
now on to what you really came here for
the hashtag faux filter our high
coverage foundation by huda beauty comes
in a bunch of colors it has 35 mils
which is 1.18 ounces of product and the
line comes in a bunch of colors now of
course I'm gonna focus on the lightest
the fairest colors because I'm a weight
that's see-through paper and what
actually really really surprised me
usually I go for the lightest shades in
any range and for this range for this a
line of foundations that is milkshake
now if I apply a little bit of milkshake
to my John you are about to witness a
shade that is to life form is
nikkietutorials
to light so if you are lighter than my
skin tone good and I see myself moving
in between cashew
panna cotta and vanilla I am a mixer I
mix colors I mix finishes because I feel
like when I make my own little cocktail
of colors and finishes it just it here's
to my skin more and it just suits my
skin more and it just adjusts to my skin
more in those three is my perfect spot
but before we go on to the application
first let's prime now there are a couple
of primers that really worked for me
with this foundation of course DJ one
jelly pack is a must this goes with
everything and I love it so much it
gives you that stickiness plus moisture
and it just it's an amazing primer that
you need in your life
I also tried the NYX HD primer for this
foundation did not work for me it became
a little bit too dry the overall mixture
became a little bit too drying and a
little bit too matte for me which caused
for the foundation to make my pores look
a little bit bigger than they actually
were so this primer is the no for me
with this combination I do have a magic
concoction here I've been showing you
this primer for over the last year a
couple of times and every time I talk
about it I don't want to talk about it
because I get so much hate for talking
about it this truly is the queen and
king of all the primers out there in my
opinion this is the Sicily double tensor
long-term lasting primer this is magic
in a bottle I only use it for special
events when I know I want my makeup to
last till the wee hours of the night
so I don't use it every day because it's
too expensive but if I have a special
event that I want to make sure that my
face is on all night long this is a
primer that I use so I've been using
this primer to make it sticky and to
make it adhere and to make it
long-lasting then I've also been loving
this one right here this is the Becca
velvet blurring primer
in the color apricot haze I put the
Sisley on first and put this one on mine
just the areas where I get oily and
shiny first let me tell you this
concoction of primers go so well with
this foundation for my skin type my skin
type dry combination I am dry as a
desert my t-zone gets oily as so
I need the best of both worlds and I
feel like this primer potion gives me
that that was a long story for just two
products so first applying this this
leave primer to my face and the bigger
one to my shiny oily areas ask for
application my favorite sponge to apply
this foundation with is my morphe it's
this one right here with the flat top
with the with the point with the this
one is really good after using it every
day for a couple of months now it's my
favorite sponge on the market okay let
me give my color I pick the foundation
up on my sponge and I go ham on this
space my favorite part of the day is
whatever move my face oh my god look at
that look at that look at that look at
that look at that look at that look at
that it keeps on going it keeps on going
look at this instant cram skin oh and
maybe I should have been a little bit
more clear my intro if you were looking
for a natural finish you will not find
it in today's video or any video on my
channel I am a full coverage addict I've
been trying to seek help for it it
didn't work I've been trying to give my
life together and become a natural Queen
it did not happen
so once fully applied it leaves you with
a very full coverage perfect flawless
finish face it gives you a semi matte
feel see how it still has a little bit
of that Sheen going on so it has a semi
sheen madness going on but it's still
pretty matte overall and just it makes
your pores look smaller it's just like a
veil of perfection on top really I love
this I've been wearing it for three I
love this my favourite concealer to pair
with this foundation is by NARS opens
the lid my favorite concealer to pair
with this foundation is by NARS it's
this one right here this is called the
soft matte complete concealer and I just
douse it onto the areas where I want
more which is pretty much my entire face
right here under my eyes whoa like I
said pretty much my entire face and now
I buff it in with that same sponge and
this mixture just blends together so
seamlessly and so nicely it's it's been
a favorite like I cannot put this
combination of primers foundation and
concealer down it just gives me that
flawless finish it's a lot it's a lot of
makeup don't get me wrong it's a lot of
makeup but I'm known for that I love a
lot of makeup I love full coverage and I
know a lot of people want to see sheer
and natural beauty for once but I feel
like that's not me it's fun for a video
once that it might even do it but that's
not me I love the k-cup
I love the whole shebang and this
mixture looks stunning it makes you look
Photoshop ly perfect
and then I quickly baked my undereyes
using the Maybelline fit me loose powder
in number five okay and quickly now
gonna work on my eyes and brows and then
we're gonna see how blush and bronzer
and contour and highlighter works with
this combination of products and I am
Vic so as always bronze smokey eyes that
there isn't a day where I don't you
don't smoke yet it's just alright so my
eyes are done and I'm feeling very
smokey and sexy and bronzed and as you
can see the face is still looking
flawless after applying all the powder
and taken away the under-eye baked it's
still looking so it's the gram ready now
let's see how it reacts to bronzer and
blush and highlighter and all of that
because a lot of cream foundations move
and slide and slip when you go over top
with bronzers or powders or when you put
friction on the area one fine that is
known for it for me is the RCM a cream
foundation the little pots they're
stunning on the skin they look amazing
on the skin but as soon for me as soon
as I go in with the brush and start
bronzing and buffing everything in it
just it leaves holes it shows my skin
underneath and it just starts looking
really really messy so first I'm
bronzing and for everyone that is about
to leave a hateful comment about my
foundation lips it will be all over soon
in like a minute so calm down so as you
can see I'm buffing it in very quickly
and it's definitely touching my skin but
it's leaving the foundation in place
it's not leaving any weird holes it's
not leaving any weird marks or streaks
or whatever it is locked and loaded baby
same thing goes for the contouring it's
just going on so well it blends out very
quickly very easily all without
disrupting that base underneath
faking my jawline and santa claus is
coming to town all right now time for a
highlight my favorite part hood have
recently launched her winter highlighter
pelt that packaging oh my god oh my god
do you oh my god all right so this is
what the palette looks like and I really
want to glow with this color right here
this is called a winter rose and it has
a nice little pinky peach eesh I don't
want the Apple
oh the cheek right here right there
hello and then going ham with glazed
donut on the actual high points of the
cheek and honestly that leaves the skin
looking plastic fantastic it looks so
flawless
it's like a veil of like flawless
perfect skin I love it so that is
personally how I love applying this
foundation with my skin type and how I
like my makeup to look now a couple of
things you need to know about this
foundation is that it is super super
full coverage if you do not like full
coverage this one's not for you there's
always ways to tone it down by mixing it
with your moisturizer or with primers
but it's gonna be very intense now if
you're like me and you think makeup is a
form of art and you want to start off
with a clean canvas this right here is
what you want in life I've also been
testing its longevity over the last
couple of days and on the first day of
me trying in I work for 12 hours
straight and after 12 hours it still
looked amazing and in those 12 hours I
only powdered once to blot away any
excessive shine at the end of the day it
did enhance a couple of the pores on my
chin area and my nose and forehead area
but other than that it still looked so
flawless I also want to say that this is
the first foundation that is so long
wearing that I've only had to powder
once in 12 hours for me I have to powder
after 4 to 5 hours always
with this one I didn't have to and that
was crazy to me so the following day I
wore it again and I work for 16 hours
still looked amazing at the end of the
day so if you ask me I think this is a
long wearing full coverage dream for
anyone with combination skin I am head
over heels for this one this is not
sponsored I am NOT paid to say this I
did get these in PR to try out but oh my
god the only downfall it is $40 $40 is a
lot of money for foundations and I am in
no position to look into your wallets or
have any knowledge about that but if you
think $40 is worth it for foundation
then buy it because we're gonna look
flawless that meat but if you think that
is too much that is too much it's all up
to you it's all personal preference I'm
obsessed I'll be buying it again once I
run out so yeah that wraps up my journey
with this foundation over the last
couple of days I had so much fun testing
it out and really seeing what it did and
it didn't affect my skin and it didn't
make me more dry or it didn't affect any
changes in my skin so I'm in love let me
