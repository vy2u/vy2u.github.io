fun video today I'll be showing you how
I did my makeup in high school now I
feel like so many youtubers have done
this already so here I am doing my part
I know what to do this I personally
loved high school I mean I have my
friends I had so much fun during high
schools when I started my youtube
channel when I was 14 so I feel like in
a way I kind of skipped the entire
that's a lie I did not skip the ugly
face I started my youtube channel when I
was 14 years old so I was in high school
so during high school everyday I would
try a new look so I would try out new
colors when I ordered my first 88
eyeshadow palette from Coastal Scents I
used to wear different colors every day
to school and to meet personally schools
like experimenting with colors new
techniques new liners new everything
so Tania's school was one big experiment
I went to high school when I was 12 and
I started my channel mid 14 and I didn't
really start wearing makeup till I was
12 and going to high school so that is
about a year and a half of total
confusion and despair of having
absolutely no clue what I was doing to
my face I don't want to go back in time
and stop myself like the popular girls I
feel like I'm got they're so pretty I
want to be like those now mind you when
I just went to high school I was
insecure
I felt ugly I felt that's that story it
is time to take a trip down memory lane
and I am excited I'm also frightened for
my life but let's do this alright so we
are here bare face and ready alright so
the first thing I'm gonna do is conceal
now concealer was like this big mystery
to me every girl out there pancake their
face to oblivion
so I felt like I had to do that so the
first thing I always used in the morning
was this could Treece concealer palette
I am shocked this is still around
because I've used this everyday when I
was in high school until I started my
channel so this palette right here was
so intriguing to me because it had green
and it had a very light color so the
green I would always go in with my
fingers they
our little to no brushes in this video
because I did not know what brushes were
I did not know that brushes existed I
did not know that people used brushes to
apply makeup with everything was fingers
and and mess so the first thing I always
did was I went in with the green now as
a kid I had super super red cheeks now I
still have red cheeks but I know how to
cover him up nicely so what I would do
is smear the green all over my cheeks
and look what amazing coverage this
product has like you can smear this on
for a lifetime and it will do nothing I
think I read somewhere that green
counteracted red so I was like I need
this green all over my face any shade of
red in my face I hated I wanted to be
invisible in high school because I was
so damn ashamed of my face it's that
it's actually a crime stuff alright so
once I've had all this green on that's
when I would go in with the lightest
color and I would do concealer before
foundation I would put concealer under
my eyes and I would get rid of dark
circles I had one high school friend who
loved makeup she had eyeliner on she had
100 layers of mascara on she had the
full shebang going on and she kind of
was my inspiration for makeup up until I
said of my youtube channel she was
gorgeous she always had perfect makeup
on and she I remember her having the
most long beautiful lashes of life
surrounded in 108 coats of mascara but
the lashes were there and I was so
obsessed because I I've never had
beautiful lashes in my life I feel like
this is such as that story alright so
that would be it for the concealer
palette now this is this is where it
like actually happens for me now when I
was in high school every girl I knew use
dream matte mousse by Maybelline as
their foundation this is their lightest
color this is number 10 ivory and I
would pancake
this on my face until oblivion yes this
is way too dark for me and you know what
we did not care because I loved it and I
would literally go like this smart on to
my face and then with my fingers I would
start blending it in my god this feels
so wrong this feels very silicone II I
haven't touched this since high school
this foundation and now feeling it again
it is so silicone II oh my god I didn't
care about being streaky I didn't care
about being patchy I just smeared it on
there and called it a day alright so
once that was on you would be like okay
that's great no I would go in with a
second layer cuz I wanted to hide my
insecurity pieces I want to hide my face
I went in with a second layer just as
thick as the first one oh my style
little pores I'm sorry oh and I did not
blend down my neck I would always walk
around with like that obvious trace of
foundation on my chin or like on my jaw
line alright so once I have that pancake
on what I would do is set it with powder
and I always change it up between the
Rimmel stay matte long-lasting pressed
powder but if I lost that for today or
it couldn't find it I would go in with
the Max Factor base Finity compact
foundation powder and number two ivory
and I think I like this one a little bit
more because I remember it having more
coverage and it came with a little
sponge and I used that to set my face
with I would like literally gunk powder
up on the sponge like that and I would
just set it set it and forget it now is
this color way too dark for me yes ma'am
yes it was but you know what everyone in
class was tan and beautiful and I was
the set little ghost I mean this
difference in neck and face
that is how I would walk around and I
would feel
boats in it and you guys I wouldn't
apply a little bit
I would cake this on I would go layer
after layer after layer until I was a
pancake all right once I would have that
set I would move on to my brows now I
remember with my brows they would used
to be very wild and untamed and I
remember when I was around 12 13 I went
to beautician to get him tweeze for the
first time in my life and this woman who
did it was around 70 years old so she
was all the way back to the 70s in the
80s and she thought that
thirteen-year-old girls wanted seventies
eighties brows as well I left that salon
with the sperm cell brows and I remember
when she was done and she handed me a
mirror I freaked out I didn't know what
to do I almost had a panic attack I went
on my bike home I cried so so hard I
screamed and my mom was like what is
wrong and I say look at my face look at
my brows look what she has done and my
mom my mom is a very bad liar and she
went it's beautiful honey and I remember
always buying a wet and wild eyebrow kit
but wouldn't when I was no longer
available in the Netherlands so I went
for the next best thing this Rimmel brow
this way so I'm gonna try and mimic my
brow shape from back then my brows
started all the way like back here like
right there there is where they would
start and they would literally go up
like this and down like that I am NOT
 you right now you can look back
at one of my first videos here on
YouTube and I kind of still had this
brow going on not kinda I had this brow
going on and I look like hot mess but
this is sort of what my brows look like
and when I vividly remember is that the
front little portion was almost like the
stick going straight like that like a
little sperm cell head
and then it will like do its thing so it
had like this little stick and then it
will oh you know and of course I hated
my brows but I mean so many girls
actually have this because we all went
to that same lady so all of us were like
it's it's what it should be looking like
okie dokie said that will be brows now
after brows I would do my eyes I did not
know what primer was had to keep that on
for an entire day I would put eyeshadow
on and then after like three hours it
would have creased up and I would end up
with like two weird lines I remember my
mom always having this like Max Factor
like this duo
I should have paladin had two colors it
had a warm brown warm shimmering brown
and a frosty champagne color and I
remembered my mom putting the warm brown
all over her lid and the champagne color
up to a robe oh sorry mom I applied my
eyeshadow using one of these no blending
brushes nothing none of that and I think
the closest color that my mom had was
this one right here it's like a topi
warm brown shimmery color I applied it
all over my lid all over I did not know
what precise application or blending and
if I would have fallout I would go back
in with that nasty sponge with the
powder and just rub it in so I would
just go up like this and kind of round
it out and then I would shave my finger
and kind of smudge it out because it
didn't like how I had that line see the
blending was in me the blending was in
me I didn't like the harsh line so I
would kind of like rub it away and I
would be left with this and see how I
have all that like oil from the
concealer and foundation on my lids yeah
it would just go over top with the
shadow and I would not care and then I
would flip this brush over and it would
go in HD and panie light color and what
I would literally do what this color is
go on my brow bone and blend it down to
that brown color and then what I
remember is that everyone out there
applied thick black eye Kohl to the
waterline and even onto the base of the
lower lash line to really
like give your eyes definition and on
the lower lashline right underneath I
have really small eyes and then all the
pretty girls have like this big doll
eyes and when they would put on this
black it would look so smoldering and
sexy and when I would do it it would
close my eyes off so what I did to
counteract having smaller eyes I would
go lower down with the black to kind of
make it look a little bit bigger now
would be the time where I applied
mascara remember how I told you how I
had that one beautiful friend with
amazing lashes she had amazing lashes
but her trick for amazing mascara was
applying three to six layers and she
would sleep in it so that the next day
she could apply another layer and that
would make it even more voluminous and
beautiful now she actually told me back
then that she would remove mascara once
or twice per week once or twice per week
so I had a gang so the first one I would
always go in with was by Maybelline this
is the classic volume Express waterproof
so I'm just going to coat the lashes
as thickly as I can and then just save
time in the morning when that was drying
I would apply my bronzer and I would go
in with the Rimmel natural bronzer and I
also used a Rimmel blush and they came
with brushes like this so I would always
dunk the brush in their bronzer and I
would like balloon pop myself and it was
a common mistake that bronzer was a
setting powder so a lot of girls
including myself would use bronzer to
kind of warm up and set the foundation
another layer then it will go in with
another mascara the colossal by
Maybelline as well just another layer
one of many
and I've heard my bottom lashes I'd used
the telescopic by L'Oreal and then once
that was moderately dry this is when I
would go in with my eyelash curlers and
curl him up to God yes up to Jesus all
right and then if they were curled up I
would apply just one more layer all
right now for the finishing touch my
lips like I said I hated my red cheeks
and I hated like any redness in my face
so after completely masking all redness
already I still felt like my lips were
too red and I actually took this trend
to my youtube channel like a year in and
if you've been with me since the
beginning you know that I used to do new
lips with anything and everything I
always felt like all the attention had
to go to my eyes or like whatever I did
that day and lips were just there and I
didn't want him to be there because they
were red and disgusting so all I would
do is completely erase every color so
what I would do is I would grab one of
these concealers right here in the shape
of a lipstick you know where I'm going
right now that would go in with a
concealer like this we want to do it
and I would apply it I would apply like
that and then grab my finger and tap it
in and then in high school to make it
last I went in with that powder puff and
come on over top to make it stay there
all day long and I would have the most
beautiful Newt lips of the entire school
all right guys that would be my look
that would be how I would walk around
feeling myself feeling like I was part
of the cool girls feeling like I was
part of something great part of
something beautiful until I started my
channel and I learned all these amazing
new tricks and I learned to love myself
for who I was and I learned to love my
pale skin and wickham long way yeah so

makeup in high school I've seen a lot of
