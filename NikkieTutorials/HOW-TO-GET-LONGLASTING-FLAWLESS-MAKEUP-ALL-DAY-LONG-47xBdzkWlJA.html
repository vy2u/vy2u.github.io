long-awaited tutorial on how you can
create a base of face that lasts all day
long this is how I like to do my face
when I want to make sure that it is
super duper long wearing so perfect for
like prom perfect for a festival perfect
for when you're on an island these are
my little tips and tricks that I picked
up along the way
that helped me get my face on how to
stay on for an entire day with minimal
touch-ups so without any further ado if
you would like to know how to get a long
ass lasting face thank you for watching
all rightie are you ready for a base
that will never let you down when it
comes to a long-lasting base one of the
most important things is primers now if
you are oily skins you might want to go
for something really heavy-duty my skin
however is very dry and combination wise
but it's very leaning towards the dry
side so what I do is go in with this
primer right here I've talked about this
a lot of times this is the Sicily double
tensor instant and long-term primer and
what I love about this primer is that it
becomes really really sticky now in my
mind when something is really sticky
anything you put it over top is really
going to cling onto it and stay there
for the rest of the day so for me this
primer is really a magic worker like it
does it all for me I feel like once this
becomes that tacky layer everything I
put over top just stays there now of
course there are so many primers out
there and I think it's all very like
personal preference as to what you like
and what works for your skin tone but if
you are dry - combination leaning more
towards dry I really recommend this from
the price is ridiculous I don't even
want to talk about it but it's so worth
it
so I want the primer up between my
fingers and then I softly massage it
into my skin massage it in so make sure
we go
haha and then as you are massaging it
and you feel it becoming a little bit
more tacky and that is when I start
tapping it into the skin this will
really get the IV can you shut up as it
starts becoming tacky and you start
tapping it in it just makes it more
tacky for me somehow when it comes to
long-term makeup something equally as
important is the foundation that you
wear you can go for something sheer and
very water based you can go for
something I like medium coverage but on
a very oily base I feel like to keep
your makeup on the longest you have to
go with long wearing foundation now the
two miracles in my life right now are
Lancome ten is old 24-hour makeup ultra
ultra 24-hour makeup and I am in the
color 100 ivory neutral and another
long-lasting space is by Estee Lauder
this is the Double Wear say in place
foundation these two separately are
incredible as warm this one to a private
island and it was super duper hot and I
was so proud that what this technique my
face lasted all day from morning till
night but recently I started mixing
these two together and it's become my
ultimate favorite long-lasting formula
so today I'm going to make these two
foundations together and this will make
for a super super long lasting base and
my favorite way of applying foundation
is using a damp Sigma blender
and especially with long wearing
foundation it is key that you move fast
once the foundation starts drying in and
settling down it stays there it locks in
and you can do anything to it so if you
see anything you want to blend it into
the skin a little bit more do it
immediately there is no applying it now
coming back to it later to blend it in a
little bit more you want to get it
perfect from the get-go because once it
sets it stays there when it comes to
concealer I feel like any choice it's
pretty safe when you have such a
rock-solid face any concealer you put
over top is actually fine can't mess up
the base really so my favorite is
heart-shaped tape I apply concealer to
kind of highlight the face and bring
life to it and then with that same Sigma
Blender I just bounce it in I always do
under eyes last now I do want to mention
that however much you apply with this
technique it doesn't matter it still
works if you are a full coverage Queen
like I am take it on if you like a
softer thinner layer of coverage this
technique will still you know pull
through so don't feel like you have to
take it on in order for this technique
to work it's just my personal preference
so first let's have in the lower edges
get that nice and smooth
I'm going to start focusing on the
actual under-eye I'm looking up to
present creases now this is where the
important stuff comes in of course your
primer your foundation your concealer
can all be so long-lasting but if you
don't set it with a powder it's never
gonna last that is trick or rule number
one when it comes to the long-lasting
makeup you wanted to set in order to
stay there so personally for me I like
to start with setting my under eye area
I always go in with the dermablend
translucent powder this is what the
packaging looks like this is amazing on
the under eyes because it's such a
finely milled powder
it really looks traceless underneath
there it doesn't have a color to it so
it won't alter the color of your
concealer it just didn't alter like the
texture or like the color which is what
you want now a trick to making your
under eye area last and don't crease
throughout the day is using a damp
sponge and then pick that powder up and
set your under-eye area so before you do
this you want to go back in with your
sponge and make sure that all creases in
your under eye area are gone and pick up
the powder with your damp sponge and
press
and notice how it has a white cast now
this will all go away once you brush it
all off so don't worry about that now
the same technique or philosophy kind of
applies to the foundation as well if you
want your foundation to last you're
going to have to set it with a powder
and my favorite technique for this is to
grab a little tiny powder puff and loose
powder there are endless amounts of
powders on the market my two favorites
are these right here I have a drugstore
option for you this is airspun you can
get this at I believe CVS Walgreens I
dono and another powder I really love
and really looks beautiful on the skin
is by Kat Von D this is the Lockett
setting powder in translucent so both
are equally as amazing I'm going to go
for the airspun today and now what I do
with airspun is I pick some up with my
powder puffs and set my most oily areas
of my face with that so my cheeks don't
really get oily throughout the day so I
leave that alone
but like my chin above my lip my nose
size of my nose and forehead is what
gets oily for me throughout the day so I
want to lock that in if you wanted this
to be soft and natural this is not the
place so I pick up the powder with my
powder puffs like that now this is going
to look very messy very ugly and ashy
but let me tell you in the end it will
all pull through and all I do is
literally set my face by patting the
powder in you don't rub it in you don't
want to smear it in you want to Pat it
into place so you're really locking down
like I said it's not a pretty stage so
once you've done this and you've really
locked in the oily parts of your face
now it's time to brush it all off and
get rid of the ugly stage so this is
right I like to go in with this
Charlotte Tilbury
airbrush flawless finish skin perfecting
micro powder in number one and my ELF
foundation blurring brush and I kind of
like to pick up a little bit of this
powder to set the areas that I really
didn't like take down so I pick up some
on my brush and I start kind of where I
ended with the bake and I just gradually
like in circles tapping circles
I set every area of my face and like
move to a new destination and like set
it all I also work in and brush away the
airspun with this brush so with this
brush I kind of really all work the
powder into my skin now that still
doesn't mean that it all looks
absolutely a okay after you've done this
powder because you'll look very powdery
of course because there's a lot of
powder or your face so the trick to that
is doing your eyebrows doing your eye
makeup doing your cheeks during your
lips and then is when we go in with our
setting spray and that is really going
to transform a cakey and powdery look to
something a long wearing semi natural
and just amazing okay so the overall
part of her face is set now all we have
to do is get rid of the under-eye baked
for this I love going in with this fit
me powder by Maybelline in the color 100
I like this because it is light enough
for my fair skin tone and I really like
the texture and the formula of it it
just looks really nice on the skin so
with that same elf brush I pick up this
powder and I kind of had away the
under-eye baked
and that my love is the most important
step of this routine now it's your time
to do your brows your eye makeup do all
of your makeup and then at the very end
of that comes into setting spray and
different techniques of using that in
order to make this look less powdery and
more like skin so I'm going to do the
rest of my makeup right now and I'll be
right back all right so I have my full
face almost done I just wanted to come
on here because I have a very special
announcement concerning my collaboration
with Oprah cosmetics you guys made the
first launch such a huge huge success so
now I just got the word that we are
bringing the collection back we're
bringing it back Plus what is even more
amazing about this is that we're also

management at Oprah and I convinced them
you helped me convincing them bringing

coven separately or still with the Box

thought it would only be fitting to do
my globe using my baby ever glow today

Time and to celebrate that even more
Oprah and I came up with the idea to fly

headquarters next week to do a meet
agreed to celebrate the launch and
relaunch so if you want to meet me and
you're in the Florida area which is
really big I will be at the Oprah

box but I would love to meet you and
sing out with you and take photos and
and hug I love hugs
for lips today I'll be using nude potion
to celebrate I mean don't judge me and
now it's time to seal the deal baby it
is time for setting spray now this is
one of my favorite parts of you my
makeup because it really transforms
everything and it just so the magic
trick to making any setting spray work
is the following and I learned this from
makeup by Mario also known as Kim
Kardashian's makeup artist his technique
is spraying the face and right after
grab something to static when I was
younger I had to take my bike to school
and when I was wearing makeup and it
would rain I would have the wind hitting
my face so it would be constantly rain
wind rain wind sort of like sentence
rate and then fanning it to make it dry
and whenever that would happen I would
end up at school looking like a drowned
cat I drown whale and my makeup would be
everywhere but it would be locked in
like it would almost be impossible for
me to get it off and when I saw Mario do
that it just it was like oh so the
ultimate trick to making any setting
spray work is setting your face with the
sprays and completely fanning it until
it's dry it works it keeps my makeup on
for hours upon hours upon hours you're
like we waited a week for that trick yes
you did
and this just takes away the powder eNOS
of your face and transforms it back into
skin and it keeps it on for the rest of
the day I know it's so silly but try it
out it actually works and let me over
work for you and that guys it's how I
like to create the most long-lasting
base to my capabilities like this is how
I know my base will last throughout the
content I mean I do powder every now and
then because my nose tends to like the
oil city but other than that the overall
look and appearance of my face looks
flawless all day long so try it out let
me know if it worked for you if it
didn't work for you oh fudge
