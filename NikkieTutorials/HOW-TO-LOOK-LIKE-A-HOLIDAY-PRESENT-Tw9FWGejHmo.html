literally so excited for today's video
I've been waiting to do this for two
days today on my channel I'm gonna be
showing you how to look like a holiday
present that was a joke
I suck at jokes today I'm gonna be
showing you how to put Christmas lights
in your tree no all jokes aside guys
today I'm going to be playing with the
brand new Julius place palette if you
have been a longtime lurker or watcher
of my channel you know that Juvia space
is my favorite eyeshadow brand out there
it nothing compares there smooth buttery
so intensely rich with pigment and
affordable like you cannot even believe
it today they are launching a brand new
palette so this is it right here it is
called now here we go because I was like
the the douche the douche it's not
doubts it's not doubt saying it's not do
saying if deuces was plural deuce is
singular this palette right here is
called the deuce Baiju vs and inside is
a treat for us all look at this right
here so it's got your new tools it's got
your beautiful high shine shimmers but
it also got pops of colors which I la
love quality is insane so watches are
insane so I am so excited to be playing
with this palette right here today I
didn't do my makeup bit because we're
gonna be sitting down grabbing all the
brushes and just obsessing over makeup
while we're together so if you're
sitting down and you have nothing to do
why don't you go ahead and grab some
brushes and sit down with me ever that
any further ado let's get clam all ready
so here we are and I am barefaced and I
am ready for the cake up so I'm first
gonna prime and I definitely want to
have like that glowy luminous base going
on although we will cover it up with
like full coverage foundation after so
I'm gonna be applying the amazing
cosmetics illuminate primer highlighter
in glow Instagram
and as you can see I have a little bit
of Darkness here and here and here from
a couple of spots so I'm gonna cover
that up with a little bit of warmth to
prevent a shiness or darkness when we
apply our foundation warm it up babies
set it with the tiniest bit of powder go
over top with foundation and it's gone
blend it up get rid of any harsh edges
as to where this video is Instagram
thumbnails awaiting to have it sending
it really lightly with powder because
you want to secure it because if you go
over top with foundation and you didn't
secure it it's just gonna move and
really not do anything so you want to
secure that baby and then it's finally
time for the good stuff I'm gonna go in
with the hoodie beauty flow filter
Foundation and your dark spots are gone
some concealer I kind of want to create
an anti holiday makeup look today so
really use all the colors no gold no
silver get rid of all the festivities
whatever type of lip that isn't red so
maybe like a screw you to the holidays
for today's look hmm and then set the
under eyes using the Maybelline fit me
loose powder in oh five the first color
we're going to be going in with is
custard which is the purpley bright pink
picking this up on a zoeva two to seven
brush and with a slight circular motions
I am blending this as I'm applying it
and can we just take a very quick second
for all that pigmentation where is Manny
in the back Manny and I'm barely
touching my skin and the motions of my
brush is so soft and very circular like
really tiny circular motions I learn
this technique from Mitchell on
Instagram one of my favorite makeup
artists out there and his trick is to
just barely touch the skin and do the
smallest circular motions and it's just
gonna blend itself for you so that is
the magenta purpley pink applied as you
see no fallout and now let's move on to
the next color next we're gonna take the
Carly shave called creme and this is
going right above custard so as a
transition color picking this up on a Oh
fret 21 brush and same movement just
above custard so get that nice blend
baby to pull off such tiny circular
motions so softly on the skin you want
to take your time but you're so much
better off taking your time and getting
it right from the first go then having
to go back in and spending the rest of
your year blending your mistakes oh my
god literally
moment I finished blending the church
bells start ringing outside thank you
for everyone above cheering me on thank
you now we're gonna take the color tart
which has a pink duochrome Sheen and a
pine dis onto the brow bone using a Ray
Morris 9.11 brush you know what time it
is
with a Mac 252 I am now cutting the lid
to create an optical larger eye and
setting the lid using puffs one of my
favorite colors of the palette
now going back in with the coral shade
creme and using this as a transition
color from the shimmer eNOS to the pink
and then finishing the outer corner off
with the purp light pink shade custard
now going to use the green of the
palette macarons with a mixing medium
and applying it as a liner on the
waterline I'm applying a little bit of
Marc Jacobs
Highliner matte gel eye crayon and
brownie of course smudging that in use
my smashbox precise smudger brush and as
smoking that out using a mixture of
crepes or crepes and chocolate
and they're really softly right
underneath I add the tiniest bit of that
pinky shade to make it a bit more
cohesive and lastly I'm gonna highlight
the inner corners using tart and to
finish the look of course some lashes
and these are Tati lashes and TL for the
gods are with me today it just started
raining I finished my eyes and it
started pouring outside such a balance
these really bright eyes of course you
have to structure and kind of build up
the face a little bit more as well so
first I'm gonna bronze I'm not gonna
talk about what bronzer it is because I
used the same rods are every day Jesus
who pissed mother nature off fer blessed
gonna use this blush right here by
covergirl called 100 light rose and also
has a little bit of a sheen to it so
your highlighting while you're at it
although we will add more of course
although Thanksgiving is over we're
still carving the cheek and for
highlight our gonna be using one of my
old favorites Coco bling by artist
couture
then Ephraim lipliner I'm gonna go in
with the Kylie cosmetics lip pencil in
the color Malibu but for lipstick I'm
gonna go in with this darker warmer nude
which is by Jordana tisha and this is in
the color in the bus and then for glass
am using a Jordana Tisha product as well
this is able to floss in the color
clueless and that guys concludes this
playtime video using the brand new deuce
palette by devious place and again it is
a home run for me everything I look for
in a great quality eyeshadow this
palettes got it pigmentation got it
minimal to no fallout got it easy to
blend without losing its color got it
this palette and all of devious plays
palettes always hit the mark for me and
this one again I love it so so much at
first when I saw the preview pictures I
was like that's a bunch of random colors
in one palette but as you can see if you
swap out the pink for this one right
here and this one right here
you have a beautiful neutral look so you
don't have to go crazy
I feel like this fellow right here is
really good to like push your buttons a
little bit and to try and send her out
into a little bit more colorful looks
but if you don't want to because skip
the pink or the green and you keep it
fairly warm and neutral so I think this
palette is so worth it and I feel like
any palette by Juvia Smith is worth it
so this one nonetheless and my favorite
thing about gb/s placed palettes will
always be the price this palette right
here retails for $21.50 Nicki it brings
it down even more so that gives you this
palette under $20 and I think it's so
worth it and nothing but a glowing
review for this brand right here I love
it so that's it guys what do you think
of this palette
