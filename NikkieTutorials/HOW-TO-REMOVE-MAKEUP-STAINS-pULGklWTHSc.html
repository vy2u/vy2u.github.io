planet earth who is okay with them
lately the liquid lipsticks and colored
eyeliners have been taking over the
makeup world and it's fun and all but
how do we get them off without them
staining us we got all these intense
blue teal eyeliners that are gorgeous on
the eyes but once we take them off
they're still there so with the latest
trends of makeup comes makeup staining
and believe it or not I have the
solution I know I've talked about men's
aftershave balm being the perfect primer
for foundation because it contains
glycerin and glycerin keeps the face
intact for the entire day and if you
thought that would be the last time I
would recommend a manly product as our
Savior you were wrong
a couple of days ago it was SuperDuper
hot here in Holland and I filmed a
couple of tutorials with some very
bright colors and a little teensy tiny
drop of hot pink liquid lipstick fell
down on my bare leg great I thought
that's gonna take three weeks at least
to come off and as by coincidence later
that day I started shaving my legs and I
used my boyfriend's shaving cream and as
I got to the spot of the liquid lipstick
and I started massaging the shaving
cream onto the stain it removed it I
didn't know if my eyes were betraying me
or if I was just seeing things so I put
it to the test and it works I gathered
all the products that I know stain my
skin most and as expected when I took my
makeup off everything that I expected to
stay there was still there I took my
boyfriend shaving cream I massage it
into my face rinsed it with water and it
was gone now before you all go put
shaving cream on top of your eyeballs
and onto your lips a little disclaimer
if you have an eyeliner that stains your
eyelids keep your eyes shut as tight as
possible and massage the shaving cream
onto the lids and immediately right
after rinse with water make sure every
little drop of the shaving cream is
removed from the eyes as soon as you
open your eyes again same for lips
please do not get the shaving cream into
your mouth do not swallow it
do not do weird stuff
with it just keep your mouth closed
remove the stains wash off with water
and it should be gone I put three most
of my stainable products on the back of
my hand and it will show you how the
shaving cream will remove any staining
that is left so as you can see by just
wiping the products off with a makeup
wipe there's still a lot of staining
left behind now simply just take the
shaving cream massage it into the
stained areas and just keep massaging
for about half a minute rinse with water
and it's gone and that guys is how you
can get rid of makeup staining on the
skin now I don't know what to do when it
gets on to your clothes because my mom
does that if you've had the super bright
red liquid lipstick and it's still
staining please try this out do not
swallow the product or get it into your
mouth and all should be fine and stain
