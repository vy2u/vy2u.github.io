you just I've never done this before for
the first time ever on my channel
probably not because I've been doing
this for nine years but I am opening a
tutorial video with no makeup on hello
so on this a lovely Wednesday today I
want to do a very glam sexy smoky
sophisticated but most of all go lamb
Thanksgiving makeup look and I want to I
just want everyone to feel beautiful and
amazing and their best selves basically
we're going to be transforming ourselves
into a sparkly turkey today gold so grab
the brushes grab your shadows and let's
get glammed together alright so today
I'm gonna be priming way differently
than I usually do because I've been
seeing people Prime with the most glowy
products on the market and then they put
foundation overtop and somehow it just
it just radiates through so I'm gonna be
trying that so I'm gonna be trying the
iconic London illuminator drops this one
is in the color Shan shine original so
gonna be playing this but also mixing in
with a Mac strobe cream just a warning
I'm gonna be looking like a radiating
tinman so wear sunglasses wear
protection baby shall I do with the
Instagram way I'm doing it I'm not gonna
miss this opportunity you're gonna do
with the Instagram way yes mmm yes what
my brand new shirt why do people do it
like that it doesn't make any sense and
then the best part and now these are
buffing it in baby
suddenly Instagram loves me why do
people do this I'm so confused okay then
so apparently this is an amazing Dewey
primer that is gonna make you look like
a glowy Victoria's Secret model and you
know give me that please for a
foundation today I'm gonna be going in
with the hood of beauty foe filter in
the color angel food and mixing it in
with a drop of za essential high
coverage cream foundation this is so
high coverage is insane and this is in
the color alabaster and applying this
using my morphe sponge oh and let me say
it again if you are new here and you
were looking for a natural finish this
is not the channel although I have told
myself to do a natural makeup challenge
this is probably an everyday look for
most people but for me it's an actual
challenge to go natural so I might
upload a video soon to do a natural
makeup channel and I'm talking natural
things BB cream think naturalness think
natural for concealer gonna be using
this NARS complete note no soft matte
complete concealer and the color light
one and this is my favorite concealer as
of this moment
look I've hit pan I've hit pan I love
that much
and I'm gonna bake my under-eye area
using the Maybelline fit me loose
finishing powder alright so here we are
before we start I do want to let you
know that throughout this look there are
gonna be a couple of stages where you
are gonna think to yourself oh my god
oh my god I mean I definitely have those
stages throughout doing this look as
well but I just want you to know that in
the end everything will be just fine
you're gonna look amazing for
Thanksgiving or wherever you want to
wear this look - but I just want to warn
you that there are gonna be stages where
you're like oh my god what did we do and
you know if at the very end you still
don't like what you're looking at just
throw glitter on top and you're fine
alright so I'm already primed and now
we're gonna move on to the first shadow
I'm going in with this morphe 39a
eyeshadow palette and taking this color
right here called cat eye and this is
going all the way into the crease and
first and kind of stamping the color on
in the shape that I want
and today in keeping this shape a little
bit more rounded and by pressing the
color in first into the shape that you
like it you're gonna have minimal
fallout
going all the way to the inner corner
now that you've got this very intense
shape you want to go in with a clean
blending brush and buff out the edges
and just use very light feathery strokes
you barely don't touch your skin and the
bristles of your brush are barely moving
that's how soft you want to blend this
out now I'm gonna take a little bit of
the color bear and this is gonna go
right in between where it's looking a
little messy and this is definitely one
of those stages where you're like oh my
god it's looking so splotchy it's
looking so messy you're gonna be fine so
after all of that you have something
like this but you can see that in some
spots the dark brown looks a little
splotchy or ashy so I'm never gonna go
back in with the dark brown to kind of
reinforce it now it's time to focus on
that horizontal smoky spotlight eyes so
I'm gonna go in with the Mac select
cover up to carve it out you want to go
right on the center of your eye kind of
stamp the brush down and drag it down
towards the lid
now usually what you would do is set the
entire mid portion of the lid and create
a spotlight smokey eye for the
horizontal one you first want to create
a smokey liner so I'm going back in with
a dark brown color on the lash line
blending up then you want to go in with
a shimmer that's sort of like a mid-tone
shimmer so it's not your lightest
shimmer
it's a mid-tone humor set that and I'm
using so glam from that same morphe
palette and your find this on top of the
concealer almost touching the far top
edge of the concealer but just leaving
that top edge bare now on the very top
edge we're gonna use this pigment by
peaches and cream this is called Gatsby
and they're pigments are one of my
favorite pigments on the market so this
is going right on that bear edge until
you have something like this on the
waterline I'm applying these you Aislin
cream eyeliner in black then setting
that with a black shadow I'm using the
one from the morphe palette and now
smoking that lower lash are not using
evolve and on the inner corner my
favorite milk your festive gold this is
everything
For Lashes I'm not gonna be applying the
top t lashes in T L 24 alright so that
is it for the horizontal spotlights
smokey eyes I just had so much fun doing
this I look because it's a different
shape for once and it's a new technique
for one so big thumbs up to Stacey Marie
MUA on Instagram for inspiring me with
this and I hope this made you happy that
I finally played with the morphe 3098 on
camera so now let's go on to cheeks also
again if you're new here foundation lips
hi it's much it's my fourth name after
extra brown smokey eyes and glowy it
will all be over in about a minute or
two so I ordered this bronzer right here
by Tom Ford and it is called the
ultimate bronzer in the car one gold
dust but
that's warm alright so let's compare
this is gold dust Tom Ford this is my
usual from 3rd mm-hmm I'm gonna mix up
the two because people are giving me
trouble for it because people want me to
use new bronzers and I am but how can
you why fix something when did I broke
quickly some additional contouring I
cannot live without you know with all
the turkey that's gonna go down my
throat I need to sculpt honey because
I'm gonna look bloated for busts are
gonna go in with barely legal by Kylie
cosmetics
now let's do some cheap carving I told
you we're gonna we're gonna look like
we're full we're gonna look full you
know this past week I applied this to my
jaw line to like cut my cheeks and at
the very end of doing my makeup I forgot
to take this off so I went out looking
like this
yes I walked out of the house looking
like this and my friend was like honey
is that a new trend and I was like what
are you talking about
and she was like the beard is the white
beard a new trend and it was like what
oh my god I love my life all right now
I'm gonna highlight my face because I
want to look glowy AF during dinner so
I'm gonna go in with the glazed doughnut
the the further would go along with the
videos the more pin you're gonna see so
today let's actually brush the bakery
all right now for lips I'm first gonna
line my Cupid's bow and bottom lip using
these you a long wear cream lip liner
this lip liner especially this color
right here this is in the color pink
champagne shimmer this lip liner has a
shimmer to it so once you kind of rub it
in after applying it the shimmer kind of
comes up and it just looks like you have
very naturally beautifully sculpted lips
plus my favorite thing about this is
that it lasts all day so some
ingredients in this is gonna make it
last all day long and I've been wearing
it everyday when I wear makeup and I
just dude the Cupid's bow and the bottom
lip a little bit and then just rub it in
a little bit for that Schumer and oh my
god perfect lip pencil on planet earth
so see how I just did the top here for
some definition and then rub it in to
get that shimmer and make it a little
softer I love this stuff it's like
instant JLo lips in one go like look at
the difference that makes the top lip it
just makes it look so much more defined
okay now going to be applying Q a lip
creams the matte ones and the first
color is buff and for a highlight this
one is so special this is called Popeye
and it is a beautiful look at the gold
shimmer and some pop and I didn't think
I would want a gloss but I do and of
course in setting spray and that guys
too includes this sexy smoky
sophisticated most of all very very glam
Thanksgiving party look or just dinner
look or party smokey clubbing look it's
just a pretty awesome horizontal
spotlight inspired smokey eye inspired
of course by Stacy Murray makeup artists

favorite makeup artist on planet earth
