another playtime video I haven't done
one in a little bit and I recently
received the Hooda Beauty desert desk
palette this has hood as a second
palette and this is a nice shift towards
more purpley tones more blue purple
tones more peachy tones her previous
palette was really red and pinky this is
more purpley and warm it's pretty much
the same palette but a lot more purple
so today I am taking this palette out
for a spin I want to see what the
formula looks like on me how the shadows
work on me does it have fallout
does it stay true to color so this is
what is to be expected I live for this
look it's a little bit Arabian Nights
it's a little desert dusk it's a whole
lot of fun a whole lot of the liner and
a whole lot of lashes and a lot of glam
um so let's get down and dirty and let's
see what this palette looks like I have
a bunch of other hood of beauty goodies
on my face right now so it's just a
bunch of fun and let's just sit down and
do our damn makeup so yeah here we go
the first color I'll be going in with is
amber and I absolutely love the shade
and on is a wave a 2 to 7 brush I'm
gonna define the outer portion of my eye
blending all the way out to the outer
corner and into the crease and for once
I'm not going to follow the natural
shape of my eye I'm actually gonna bring
this lower down and straighter out
then once I reach about half of my
crease and go over into Eden and this is
going all the way into the inner crease
same brush go in there baby and so far I
am loving the pigmentation
I'm loving the payoff it is true to
color what you see in the pan is what
you have on your eyes it is a good
shadow all right now let's put the
blending to the test let's see if after
blending the intensity and the color is
still there I'm gonna go in with a 2 to
7 which I use on my other eye but this
is a clean one and I'm just gonna buff
out the edges just going back and forth
on that line hand so the shadows are
blending really really easily I do need
to go back in with the colors a little
bit to get my shape back in but this is
what I have to do with every shadow out
there and I do want to show you what the
palette looks like after dipping into
the shadows so there is a little bit of
build up in the pan they are a little
bit powdery but nothing like we're used
to with a recent palette coming out I'm
gonna be cutting my lid using the Mac
select cover-up concealer this is a
staple you need this when you want a
beautiful carved out lid and setting
that with Twilight easily probably my
favorite shade out of this entire
palette it's so unique I love it so much
I love it
the only complaint I have concerning
Twilight is that it is crumbly and loose
in the pan so if you dip your brush in
you do have a lot of powder in your
palette but try to pick that up as much
as you can and deposit it onto that lid
baby because this color is precious
alright I'm picking up attainment of the
purple color amethyst and blending that
in right in between you know and I'm
really liking the blueness of that
Twilight color is going to go and with
this diamond powder by make up forever
this is like a soft glitter and going
right over top in the center see how
that just takes the blue sparkle of
Twilight and gets it to another level up
lift for this lid alright to wrap up the
top portion of this eye we need a fierce
wing and we're gonna go straighter out
of the eye as opposed to lifted like
following the waterline no we're gonna
go straighter out to make the bottom
line go straight out - and then bring it
back
and I mean honestly you could pop on
some lashes and stop here but I can't
I'm gonna be going in with the dark
brown color called well in Dutch what
you see there is called out and out
means old so this pretty much is old in
Dutch I have no idea how Jota will
pronounce this but in Dutch this is out
and with an angled brush I'm creating a
parallel line to the top liner on the
bottom lid like the bottom lash you know
what I'm saying and then using that same
brown I'm gonna go all the way on my
lower lash line and make it smoky until
you have something blurred out and
smoked out like this but then I was like
okay that's cool but I need more always
so on the inner corner I'm applying a
bit of brown glitter and to define that
negative space a little bit more I'm
gonna go in with a creamy white product
for lashes I'm going to be using the
hoodie Beauty lashes in Raquel and I'll
also be popping three of these
individual clusters of lashes on the
lower lash line
all right eyes are done and I'm
absolutely loving these like I am so
happy with the outcome and I'm live for
like the bottom lashes like pheromone
hello and I do also have the hood of
beauty 3d highlighter palette which I've
never tried before so I'm gonna try it
out on camera today but before we do
that we have to put down base contouring
Brom sings blushing so first I gotta go
in with my hula lights I know there's
more bronzers out there other than this
one but can't can stop then also let's
contour and I'm actually okay plot twist
of the month I'm gonna use the k'kaw
brush I've been giving this a couple
more shots and hate me or not it
actually works in a really like it so
I'm going in with that brush and
applying a little bit of the Rodale
contour powder I just really like the
precision of this brush and it just
looks a little bit more precise and on
point with this I just I don't know I've
been giving this brush a couple more
chances and it's starting to grow on me
and I noticed myself gravitating towards
it on the daily now so and since I don't
want a to blushy look I'm gonna go in
with Bellini bio frappe this is such a
beautiful soft flush of the cheek it's a
perfect staple for your kit
see how it adds color but it's not
overpowering it's not too much it blends
right in and it gives you just enough
color to your face for a highlight never
go in with the hood a 3d Beauty through
the 3d highlighter palette okay the
first one that's really calling my name
is that white the white one is called
Santorini and it's not just a white it's
got like a pearlescent like opal shimmer
Sheen to it and quickly can we look at
that packaging
oh it's like magic whoever came up with
this at the hood of beauty team uh props
to you this everything that is so pretty
I expected more of a payoff at the first
swipe but I'm noticing to get here you
need like two to three coats which is
fine I can highlight all day every day
but yeah this is great for people like a
softer highlight too because it doesn't
go on as intense in one go as other
highlighters that I love strobed alright
so I am loving this right now but now
comes the hardest decision of life what
I'm gonna do with lips I think the eyes
are so dramatic and so everything that I
don't want to take away any attention
from them but on the other hand I have
this hoodie beauty lip strobe and do you
see in this color this one is called
shameless and it's like a duochrome
shift of pink but brown and green and
it's a lot of good in a tube and I
really want to apply this because I
swatch it over a darker color and it
truly brings out that duochrome color
and it just so it looks so good but she
also has these four lip strobes that are
in a lighter tone these two are actually
really calling my name right now so
might just go ahead and do that starker
light darker light darker line you know
what with these eyes I'm gonna say light
so first I'm gonna go in with the BFF
lip pencil by color pop the lipstick
I'll be applying is a socialite by color
train nice and nude and then the lip
strip I'm going to be going in with
first is called snobby and it's like a
pink with like light pink and like
champagne ish crystal oh my god alright
now let's set it and forget it and that
guys concludes this playtime video
featuring the Hooda Beauty desert dusk
palette if you ask me I think it's a
gorgeous gorgeous palette I think it's a
nice shift how we went from all the warm
red tones to more purpley pinky tones
and peachy tones
I think pigmentation wise formula wise
these are really really good quality as
I showed you previously they do have a
little bit of powder buildup in the pan
so they have a little bit of that powder
enos like the a BHS subculture but but
nothing like the a BH subculture so it
does have Fallout in the palette itself
but it's nothing like oh my god and I
did notice that with the previous pellet
as well there's even one true glitter
shade in here so they actually called
this a true true glitter and when you
pick it up it's glitter so I think
that's really really awesome you get a
lot of finishes mattes shimmers glitters
the extreme shines the Chrome's the
Hallet retails for $65 and you get 18
shadows for those sixty-five dollars
plus a huge mirror stunning packaging
with that really cool effect and that's
pretty much about it I definitely love
it it all comes down to personal
preference do you like these colors do
you think for six to five dollars you
gravitate towards these colors and the
question is if you think if the quality
is high enough to justify $65 I leave
that all up to you you know I don't like
making any decisions on your part it's
all personal preference to try it out so
