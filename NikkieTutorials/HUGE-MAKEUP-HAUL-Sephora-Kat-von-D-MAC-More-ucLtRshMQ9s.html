huge makeup haul my intention was to
make this a Saburo haul but then I got a
bunch of stuff that's non Sephora
also today I'm just gonna show you a
bunch of makeup that I've been thought
about just let me let's get right to it
first profits on this hot rod is by Kat
Von D and it's the locket tattoo
foundation now I got these because they
recently came out with lighter color so
I was like light colors of me so I got
the colors light 42 and light 44 because
we couldn't quite make up my mind on
which shade would be perfect for me and
result their post not perfect for me
they're both really really peachy pink
toned and I am yellow so I cannot really
get away with that so light 44 is a
total miss for me because it's way too
peachy and too pink toned and it's a
little bit too dark also and then life
42 is great because it's actually as
light as my skin but again it's more on
the peachy pink side so I mix it with my
mac studio fix fluid because that is a
little bit too yellow on me I used this
to counteract so together these are the
bomb but alone not so much I also got
the candy locky tattoo concealer I was
like okay I'm getting the foundation
might as well get the concealer so there
are a bunch of shades in the concealer
range and I got the color light 16 I was
like okay that should be light enough
it's too dark it's actually too dark for
my skin tone and I'm an NC 15 it's too
dark
no oh this is so good I got the Too
Faced to hang over but replenishing face
primer I get this in a tutorial before
because I've been having to stuff lying
around for a couple of days now but oh
this is so good this is definitely
ending up in my hips and God knows this
month this is such a good primer if you
have a dry skin day or just your skin
looks like and you need it to give
that boost you need to have that sort of
power up level up this is that after
loving the laura mercier secret
brightening powder for underneath my
eyes so much I figured I might as well
get the other powder that because if
that powder is good the other powders my
I'll be good also so I got the loose
setting powder in translucent and so far
so good and what I really like about
this one is it actually helps sort of
minimize the appearance of pores and I
don't know about you but whatever it
minimizes my pores the looks of my pores
is a winner in my book
I got the do your skin nude concealer
because of shameless fripperies here on
YouTube
karema and unfortunately this also in
number one is a little bit too dark for
on my skin tone but I mix it with a
lighter concealer and I really like what
it's doing I'm not as in love with it as
crema is but maybe it will grow me maybe
not but so far it's it's a good
concealer it's nice we're getting there
first steps are there oh another cavity
product I got another everlasting liquid
lipstick this is about how wow this is
bow hair about how five ever since I've
used fashion revival in the tutorial of
mine if people have been dying to know
if there is a tube before fashion
revival so I've been hunting down the
web to find the perfect dupe and I
figured that about how five looks a damn
lot near like it so I'm going to
continue this journey towards finding
the perfect dupe for fashion revival and
if I do find out that this is the
perfect dupe for it I would you a
blockbuster view on it oh I'm so excited
about these these are six colour-pop
lippie stix everyone on instagram and
youtube have been using these I I
couldn't wait to get mine I got the
color scheme B which is a nude I got
pitch which is a dark dark chocolate
brown I got flawless flawless
I got Frenchie which is like a pinky red
I got punky which is like a pink and
leather which is a dark purple of course
I got skimpy because of desi Perkins
here on YouTube because she uses it as
her go-to nude so I figured I need that
in my life if dusty needs it in her life
I need it in my life
then also for color pop I got six new
shades of the shadows with the super
shocked pressed pigments um these are I
believe limited edition and they might
be gone now I'm so sorry but I got this
because
see again use drift in a tutorial and
this sets included drift and drift is
like the most beautiful Oh burgundy red
color it's so gorgeous I've been wearing
it two times already because I love it
so much only headed for three days it
has some beautiful shimmering shades
this is drift and then it also has this
amazing purple shade and green and dark
purple and golden yellow they're so so
amazing you need em trying you'll love
them oh I got the two-faced semi-sweet
chocolate bar palette
umm this is been getting kind of lot of
negativity it hasn't it
I don't get it it smells amazing I love
it it just got all the beautiful warms
neutrals in it which I adore it's gonna
punch a blue in there blue it's kind of
a thing today I think it's great and
that smell that smell will win you over
girls also by Too Faced I got the milk
chocolate light medium matte bronzer now
this if you're looking for a dupe for
the illamasqua disobey bronzer that I've
been using for years and years this is a
perfect dupe because it's perfect for
light skin but also this has the same
scent as the chocolate bars and this has
cocoa powder in it which oh god I love
it so good of course I already did a
tutorial on this and a full blog post
review but I got the new Mac Miley Cyrus
Viva Glam set if you want a full review
go to my blog at make tutorials calm or
take my last video which I did a full
makeup tutorial and Sprite buy this set
on what's that good grammar don't know
also my life became a little bit of a
better place when I finally got my first
melt products this is the dark matter i
shadow stack this is a game changer why
because the eyeshadows are magnetized
and they come in a little sort of stack
of eyeshadow so at the top we see melt
so the top layer is a mirror then here
we have blur we have unseen eyeshadow
then we have enigma which is a beautiful
red this paired with drift by color pop
and then less than at least a dark dark
mats black which is called dark matter
so this is the dark matter i shadow
stack I think this is a great idea you
can do all kinds of nifty designs with
this for like your blog post reviews
look you can even keep it like that
also I finally hopped onto the melts
cosmetics lipsticks bandwagon so these
are the colors that I got I got vein
which is a black black lipstick just
black lipstick I love it I dig it I got
darling which is a purple lavender
stupid love which reminds me so much of
Kelly Osbourne is a bright neon pink
bang bang which is a true bright neon
orange and last but not least belladonna
too which is a true old Hollywood red I
ordered six new lit cosmetics glitters
because I've been on a glitter kick
lately and my favorite side of God are
Abba which I use in my previous video on
the Miley Cyrus look so Abbas just a
really nice iridescent green pink it has
a nice duo chrome and then another
favorite is Oprah and Oprah is like a
champagne e rose gold and then a bunch
of other duochrome e colors because I've
also been loving duochrome lately and
I'll be trying to do an all glitter
makeup look soon using these I went to
like a Halloween shop here in Holland
and they had grimace and grimace had
awesome glitters so I got this sort of
soft light gold glitter and this is my
grimace and it's called polly glitter 75
and it also got another one which is a
dark with gold so like a black with gold
glitter and this is the polly glitter in
number 10 oh and grandmas also had these
awesome eyeliner pencils these are the
grimace eye pencils in number zero zero
and zero so this is zero zero and this
is zero and they're just really tiny
thing precise eyeliner brushes so
they're great for like extending the
inner corner of your eyes like I did
today are just super precise and
detailed eyeliner work and now a moment
of silence please for
new anastasia beverly hills liquid
lipsticks these are literally so good I
want to wear them all on my face at the
same time they're so good they're a
bunch of amazing colors if you've
checked out my Instagram lately you can
see that I've been wearing these a lot
my favorite by far I'm gonna drop these
into my lab now and it feels great my
favorite by far is a milkshake which is
the color that I'm wearing today
I've wearing this on Instagram and
people have been going nuts because they
wanted to know what color it is
