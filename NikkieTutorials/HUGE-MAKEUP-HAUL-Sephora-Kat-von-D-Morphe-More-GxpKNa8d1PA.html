lot of shopping because I felt like it
was time to treat myself for so long I
haven't bought any new makeup because
I'm saving up for my apartment with my
boyfriend and just things are looking
like they're starting to get along um so
I was like I'm gonna buy makeup and
cuz that's what you do I would like to
talk about another game people have
started recommending the other games and
I am now hooked to toy blast toy blast
is basically just like candy crush but
cuter the game is all about this cute
little girl called Amy and throughout
the game you have chapters the sound
effects in this game just make it so
cute and the colors and the cuteness is
killing me alright so let me show you
let's get the sound on come on cute
chill down Nancy so as you can see this
is Amy's world and it has all these
chapters representing her worlds okay so
we're going to play and basically just
like all the other games you have to
match the colors and then tap on it and
they will explode and give you point ok
so I see orange Hwang I see green bang
it's so addictive I will put a link down
below in my info box on where you can
find this game and what's its call it's
called toy blast your life will be over
after playing this game so without any
further ado let's go on to my haul so
the first item I want to talk about oh
it's so heavy is this bag this is by Ted
Baker and I got this over at a sauce and
I feel wanting a new purse a new bag for
so freaking long but I was just like you
know we're gonna buy this apartment you
don't have the coins for that and I just
know you know that the power of makeup
video it went viral I bought it back so
it's a mint bag with rose gold details
and flowers on the inside I love this
back so much I used to be an all black
bag girl every time but now that I have
this mint one in my life with
rose-gold details yes yes so okay okay
so okay okay okay okay so the first
thing I want to talk about is my morphe
palette I got this palette and I got it
because I love the bright colors and the
pop of neutrals here so this is great
for hey so this is great for if you're a
neutral kind of person but you still
want to rock some color somewhere I love
this can't wait to play with this plus I
got a bunch more I got a bunch of morphe
brushes I got way too many to show you
all but I can't wait to show them in
tutorials yes I also finally got the Kat
Von D shade + light eye palette I've
been obsessing over the face palette but
I've heard very very great things about
the eye palette as well so I gave in I
purchased it and I am so excited with
this one I'm thinking about doing a
tutorial with this one only just to show
you the possibilities with this palette
I love it so much because it has warm
tones cold tones and neutral tones so
it's it's a palette for everyone on
planet earth I really dig this one I
also got the battle ash softbox pallet
so battle ash Samantha and her girls
they teamed up with Saucebox and they
came out with this palette right here I
really dig this as well it's the same as
the morphe palette where you have your
neutrals which are matte and then your
bright pops of colors which have a sheen
I've always been a huge fan of Saul's
bucks cosmetics and now that they've
teamed up with battle ash is just a
great palette I love the colors I love
the neutrals this black here is
amazeballs plus it's a great palette you
kind of need it in your life I got two
more new girl and blushes because I've
been so so addicted to golden high in
peach boy the ones I talked about in
previous videos and the colors I'd got
are chic pink which is also the
combination that I'm wearing on my
cheeks today and then also I got over
Rose which is a very bright pinky pinky
situation but ever since I got the girl
and blushes I've been in love with the
texture and the payoff and just how it
wears so I got two more in the third
slidin I got a bunch of Natasha de nanã
cosmetics so Natasha
contacted me on Instagram and she told
me about her company and Natasha makes
the most beautiful eyeshadow palettes of
life she sent me these three and I
already showed them on snapchat but
these are so freaking amazing I'm
wearing this one right here on my eyes
today these palettes are so amazing
their coverage their pigmentation their
glistening their shine it is blowing my
mind they all have this beautiful like
glistening shimmer glitter to it which
applies beautifully as so richly and
it's so amazing Lisa I'm so excited that
Natasha contacted me and gave me these
amazing palettes I will definitely use
them in tutorials soon then she also
sent me a couple of new lipsticks and
new lipsticks are the way to my heart
and I'm wearing one today the one I'm
wearing today is matte peachy nude and
it's just a it's it's beautiful this and
then over top I'm wearing her flesh lip
gloss so lipstick lip gloss is all my
lips by Natasha de Nonna and I love it
this is the naked skin concealer I got
this because of my girls desi she can't
stop talking about this so I figured
okay whatever desi loves I probably love
so I got the Naked skin concealer by
Urban Decay in fair neutral love it
wearing it today as my concealer I
absolutely love it it's so nice to take
a break of the pro longwear by Mac I've
been using that for four years now it's
nice to have a break with that oh I'm so
excited about this I got the boscia
luminizing black mask all over Facebook
you've seen these people was these
glistening black masks on and I was like
where do people get this so I stumbled
upon
bozhe and I saw that they had a
luminescent black mask so I put it in my
shopping bag and I was done then also by
bozhe I got the makeup break-up coal
cleansing oil I love using oils to
remove my makeup so I'm going to try
this out tonight to wash this face off
but I can't wait to try these especially
the black masks I've heard so many great
things mixed up by Too Faced the natural
matte eyeshadow palette I don't know
I because I have enough neutral palettes
in my life to keep me going til I die
but somehow this spoke to me and I
wanted to try it this is what it looks
like it's so cute and the inside looked
like this just a bunch of pretty
beautiful neutral colors pretty for
everyday wear I can't wait to play with
this got some beautiful neutral colors
another palette I got is by Stila this
is called the eyes are the window shadow
palette and this is in the color mind
and it's got a bunch of beautiful
beautiful colors this reminds me so much
of the va's art eyeshadow palette I've
been using so much in the past so I want
to see how this compares to the fees our
palette that's basically why I got it I
want to see how I like it
it looks so good it looks so good I got
to steal on magnificent metals foiled
eyeshadow majiggy I remember not being
able to get these and it hurt me so bad
because these are like a glistening
orgasm for your eyeballs I got the color
Kitson which looks like that oh my gosh

I got these Saurav ski earrings you
should know something about me all my
life I have hated my earlobes and I
think you might laugh at me but my
earlobes
I hate they're just so long and big and
there's just this big flop of an earlobe
throughout my youth I've created this
obsession with earlobes I will watch a
people to earlobes and be like you got
good airless so I got these cute
Swarovski earrings but I feel like my
earlobes
edom you can't see him because there's
so much elope you can't see the earrings
I found out that um there's an earlobe
surgery now which the doctor two shrinks
cuts off a part of your earlobe which
gives you nice small ear lobes so I've
been thinking of getting this done and I
know people on YouTube are like no I
will never get something done to my face
like I'm a lips done I can get my lips
done so I've been doing some research on
earlobe surgery nowadays and I was
wondering if any of you ever have had an
earlobe surgery I mean we have a million
subscribers now someone might have
gotten earlobe surgery my question to
you is if you have gotten it done what
was it like did it hurt is the result
what you want it is is are you happy are

in my brows nowadays this is an updated
eyebrow routine because many of you have
noticed over the last couple of months

little bit so today I'm going to show
