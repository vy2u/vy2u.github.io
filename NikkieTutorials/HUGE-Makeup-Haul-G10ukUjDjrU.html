long-overdue because I've had this sack
with products sitting in my room for so
long and I could not touch anything
because I didn't want to talk to
anything before doing the hall and been
about like 2 months now and I can
finally show you what I got I don't know
why it took me so long but it took me so
long so a couple of months ago I went to
Malaga Spain and I they I went to
promote a free more prime or I don't
know promote I could promote it and I
went cuckoo there I got invited by
freemore itself the brand itself they
invited me to their flagship store in
Malaga and they gave me a tour and they
gave me some lovely discounts and those
discounts made me buy lots of stuff so
get into it ok so the first thing I'm
gonna start off with is by the balm they
had the balm there I walked in the store
first Brenda saw was the bomb my boy
here was with me I was like babe they
got the bomb here and he was like the
balm what anyways I got the meet matte
nude palette by the bum and um this is
so funny meet matte nude height 6 to
team 6 to man 6 to as well I color blue
occupation eyeshadow palette enjoys long
walks on the beach creamy eyeshadows and
fabulous liners oh I love that I heard
so many great things about this so when
I saw this lying there I was like Matt
you're coming home with me so this is
what Matt looks like on the inside we've
got some amazing colors lots of Browns
lots of neutrals so it's an amazing
palette and I haven't touch it yet and a
really one two after two months so meet
Matt noot another the bomb palette I got
is de bon voyage
palette oh my god look at that it's like
a it's like a book it's like a book and
it opens like this lip products or cheek
don't know our shadows I cannot deal
with this thing I mean we got
amazing sparkly color so we got brights
we got neutrals we got darks we got
cheek lip products I plus house mirror I
cannot wait to play with this
they had real techniques there and I got
a blush brush there and I love this for
powdering the faces the faces I also got
the expert face brush by Real Techniques
already showed this in a tutorial so did
scoop that out of the bag and I also got
these silicon a liner brush by Real
Techniques I don't know about this one

yet I got a BB cream and I also used
this in a tutorial already this is the
super plus BB cream by scoops of skin79

cream by skin79
I really really like this one it has
coverage like a mofo and um I really
like it that pre more had a huge sort of
wall filled with Korean makeup brands
and I was like Hello Korea makeup brands
I'm home and the brings meets you this
leo le powder this is the leo le be my
skin twin cake powder and I've used this
for so long in the past but it turns out
that I got a colored too dark so
probably going to have to give that away
then oh this was so cute this is an egg
pore tightening pack and we all know
that Michelle Phan video where she you
know cracks an egg gets the egg white
out and puts it on her skin and she
rinses it off and has beautiful skin
after it and she'll found it before so
so this right here is especially made
for that so if you always wanted to do
that egg whites a tightening mask this
is this is your egg to go with
oh that looks disgusting in here you
have the mask but oh oh God anyway haha
another product by the balm is an over
shadow pigment and I love the over
shadow pigments
they're called the sex pods they're like
no money no honey those pots and this is
the you buy I'll fly and this is sort of
like the ginger in the
in the mix no money no honey is the
blonde and then there's this other one
that's like the black haired girl and
this is the ginger so it's a really nice
copper ish melon ish beautiful ish
pigment and a little from another Korean
brand these are the etude house dear my
blooming lips talk lipsticks and I got
them in two colors PK
0:04 and PK o o5 i mean look at the
packaging this is oh oh for and it looks
like this it's a beautiful bright coral
in pink color and this right here is oo
4 and this is a super super pretty a
sort of bright milky pastelly pinky girl
color I really really like colors like
this I got the NYX eyeshadow base in
white because I'm almost out of my NYX
jumbo pencil in milk and I wanted
something easier
um so it for that from NYX I also got a
matte lipstick this is my zone Mason
Mason I don't know my zone I don't know
it's a really really dark chocolate
brown and I don't know why I got this I
really don't know another matte lipstick
by Nixon 'god is indie flick and i got
this because of an instagram account
that I've been you know stalking lately
and they use this and I was like I have
that I need to have that so I bought it
also from NYX a jumbo lip pencil in 717
Irish coffee and I use this in my back
to school makeup look from makeup
revolution I got the awesome metals
eyeshadow in magnificent copper I used
this in a tutorial already but this is I
think a knock off from the Stila Stila
magnificent medal that no magnificent
magnificent medals I don't know um but
it's really pretty it's really nice I
love the color and it's great as a base
for pigments or I should or whatever a
back to NYX apparently I got the Wonder
pencil in light I got that I got a NYX
lip liner in natural I got this
foundation by Pierre Rene
and this is the skin balance cover fluid
foundation and I'm really liking this
one I've never heard of this brand
before but the the the girl who gave me
a tour in pomors she introduced me to
this brand and it was like yes
she told me that their foundations were
really good so I picked these skin
balance one and I've used it before and
it looks beautiful in the skin I really
really like this one and I really want
to look up more about this friend
because it's super super interesting and
this feels good from Dior I got a lip
gloss and this is number 433 and it's
just an amazing sparkly coral color and
I love my corals so this was exactly
what I needed
Oh another Korean thingy this is also by
etude house and this is a nail polish
that looks like a nice this is a nail
polish and I only wanted it for that
packaging because from Chanel I got
another illusioned um this is a meze I
think damn that was hard number 82 and
this is a beautiful natural pinky
neutral golden color oh this is so good
if you're going for that no makeup
makeup look but you still want that
really nice shine of the eyeballs so
perfect so good I love that so that's
what I got every more and then I also
did a quick stop at Kiko of course when
I'm in a country that has Kiko I go to
Kiko and they had a beautiful new
collection that was inspired by cards
set of cards and I got three beautiful
palettes the first one looks like this I
mean can we talk about the packaging
it's so so stunning and this is the
Queen of Hearts I should appel it into
one essential Brown and this reminds me
is so much of the Tom Ford palettes
because it has that same kind of feel
where they have a shimmery color in the
corner and it goes to a darker brown
whatever color you picked but I just
really really liked this one and I've
been wanting to play with this palette
for so long but I couldn't that to film
this right here so that is number one is
sensual brown and then I also got the
one in number three called elegant evany
and that one has more cool tone shades
which I really really like and
more of your purpley cooler shades I
really really like this pellets I really
want to play with them and then last but
not least Akiko I got a golden game
sculpting runs err in number one radiant
honey this just alone wanted me to buy
that entire collection because it has a
really nice bronzing shade right here
then on the bottom it goes a little bit
deeper for your contouring and it has a
beautiful golden highlight so I'm so
excited that I got these and lots of
stuff already was sold out so it's
really glad that I could snatch these
from the counter and I'm so excited with
these can't wait to play with them and
that's it actually believe it or not
