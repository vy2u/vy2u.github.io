before I begin I got a new background
light and we look like angels and I'm
still waiting for what halo I'm still
waiting for another one but this is for
now a couple of videos ago I did my
December hits into God knows and I
talked about the snowflake cookie Yankee
Candle and I asked you guys if you
wanted a haul on Twitter and you guys
wanted a because he all said woohoo blog
days ago Joyce came over and I let her
sniffed some Yankee Candles and her
reaction was so unique but I was like we
need to film the hall together so this
is Joyce hi it's probably my best friend
yes she is yeah and your mind - well
good to know
hey so Joyce is one of my best friends
and I mean now it's one of she's here
she's an amazing makeup artist she does
it's like Elex box so today we're gonna
do a Yankee Candle haul and um a couple
days ago
Joyce was here and we did some
voiceovers Joyce is really good at
making different voices so for every
candle name she did a voiceover and it's
out of this world what this woman can do
and every time we hold a candle up you
will hear in Joyce do something with the
names can you give us a preview
let's go so I just take one and then we
snip it yes the first candle is Smurf
look turtle no you dip it very good
smells like no it really smells good it
smells like the picture see it smells
like the picture don't you see a picture
like this it really smells like that the
next one is butch rock of someone told
me not to smell the can above the lid
very different
it's not as like like a beat you know
those more like flippers it's like this
is the typical smell to make that toilet
it smell good but with the Beach twist
it's fresh I love this one I got this I
started the Yankee Candle crepe because
of Sharon another friend of mine looks
by Sharon and she had Mary marshmallow
on it smells like mic if you really
sniff it really like you smell a
marshmallow oh and by the way this is
the medium size so this is the medium
one and then this is the big one sure
girls are oh I'm so this is sugar Apple
are one of my favorites because I wanted
to get this in the big jar I bought it
for her but I forgot it you're gonna get
afraid you never bought it oh god the
lid it's soap mmm
yeah but they believe it stinks I don't
know like what is the entire point of
this video you can't really describe
what something smells like it just
smells like I lived in in Knoxville
Tennessee and all these candles smell
like Knoxville Tennessee takes me back
home this is for my mom my mom wanted it
but she didn't really like it she's
sniffed it already god no smells like
the potpourri your grandma has in the
toilet cleaner
it smells like Bolton's another pretty
smell no last small jar is awesome I
really really loved it I love the color
of it it's so nuts like just that nice
makeup color to her liking your creaks
oh god that's good that's like oh it's
like cinnamon it's cinnamon you have in
Holland we have cinnamon sort of candy
and it smells like that and the cinnamon
candy has the
stripes and and it's actually the same
color for the red stripes I'm sorry it's
really winter ish it's now time for the
votives and I absolutely hate that word
I hate the word vote Oh what is that I
don't know there's probably small
candles okay
it smells like laundry like fresh
laundry for a blanket for a little baby
I would I would if if a closet can have
a candle in it without burning I would
put this in it it's very it's softer it
doesn't have that like intense it now
mean it's just like clean the next
motive is god I can't oh you can't get
it in Oh Oh God I don't know it doesn't
smell like honey and spice or anything
night it does smell like honey what the
hell is a kiku oh look at matches your
outfit oh my god no photo fetch yeah
yeah it was actually better when you
open it when I got this I was like yeah
no please never ever and when you when
you actually cut it open you take the
plastic off it smells kind of really
good it's girly yet sweet and and purple
under the palm under the tree where you
see me you can have that too if you lie
thank you you're such a good friend I
know you're welcome oh it smells like
someone put a whole shitload of grass in
the toilet yeah this one has that
these smells like a grasshopper chillin
in the toilet and then it jumps in your
I don't put my dick in Madea

like not a bad mood but sort of like we
put on Paul Rudd's wonder lust that puts
my dear King and then we just don't stop
yeah we always when we go through the
night drive and young we eat and we put
like like that on it's time for the tart
smooth hard - gonna cut it can I get it

it yeah oh that's like vanilla no it's
like the bottom of a cake of cheesecake
okay you know that the the cake of the
part of the cheesecake who that thing is
good huh I love it I really like the
Yankee Candle that did the stuff that
smells like food and yeah I think
they're I think they're best at food and
home demands the toilet Ewan's because
the fresh sends and the floral scents
are a little bit oily and a little bit
I've had this this cupcake before in
London and London hey London and it
tasted better than it smells

velvet cupcake oh I know right
it's like shabak book a flight to London

boyish deodorant with vanilla and
marshmallow I could do cuz I like boy

matias song okay guys so that was the
Yankee Candle haul um let me know if you
