tutorial on my take on sort of a
skeleton slash school tutorial a lot of
people have been doing this especially
when Lady gaga came out with Born This
Way this is sort of my take on it I
wouldn't be me if I didn't at colors and
glitter so this is sort of the Nikki
skull it's actually really hard to do it
took me about two and a half hours and
um for a first time trying skull this is
my outcome and I'm pretty happy with it
so yeah if you want to know how to get
this colorful skull look then please
keep on watching and I'm not really
talking and doing the voice over because
I just I wanted to concentrate on this
only it so I enjoyed okay the first
thing I'm gonna do for this look is glue
my brows back so they kind of become
flat and you don't see there's any more
and I'm just gonna use a glue stick for
this and this is the prytt glue stick
and all you want to do is brush your
hairs up into your skin so make sure
they lay flat on top of your skin and
then just remove the excess of glue that
you don't want all over your skin then
you're gonna let this dry for a sec and
then put powder on top and I'm just
gonna put a light layer of foundation on
my skin to get rid of any imperfections
because he can be a skull but you still
have to be perfect the foundations I'm
using our next face somebody in c1 it's
make myself a little bit more light
underneath my illamasqua rf1 fifteen
rich liquid foundation and just apply
this all over
now it's time for the nose and now there
are a lot of ways you can do this all I
did was just make my entire nose black
and then at the top I just had this sort
of too pointy sort of shape and then all
I did was fill that in and put black a
matte eyeshadow on top
okay for the eye I just started with
putting dots on where I sort of wanted
the lines to go to and this will kind of
really help it make it more even in
symmetric symmetric yeah you get it and
then just draw the lines and just make
your basic shape for the eyes and then
after that fill that in and set that
with matte black eye shadow as well
okay then I started doing the frown or
sort of the brow bone area and this can
really make your skull look really angry
or really happy I made my look a little
bit cranky and I will show you that in
three two one
cranky face then after that I started
doing sort of the lines that make
everything look Hollow and sort of it
will give a dimension this is for my
temple and that is again to make my brow
bone a little bit more special and more
stylish and then with a brush just blend
that out and make it look more blended
and hollow and creepy for Halloween
here I'm making a line for my forehead
again to make that look more Hollow and
more like a skull and blend that out to
make it look more Hollow okay here I'm
starting my sort of my mouth area and
then after that I do my jawline as well
I found this to be one of the hardest
parts to do because it's really hard to
do this from the side and oh and Here I
am just adding that line that I have on
the other side as well because I wanted
to make it even and then just make the
part next to your mouth black as well
and once you fill everything in and set
it with black eye shadow it will really
come to life then is when everything
will look more like a skull and here I'm
shading a bit with the black eye shadow
shading were shading more shading
for the crazy bright pink blush I'm
going to use this sleek blush called
Santorini and for my sleek acid pelo I'm
going to take the neon pink
then wherever I want a bright color to
pop I'm gonna play some NYX jumbo pencil
in milk and that is white so bright
colors will really really pop and I'm
just using my sleek acid palette and I'm
using my neon yellow and my neon orange
then I'm gonna take this Illamasqua
shadow and I will put the name on my
blog then for the glitter fun amusing
mile it's mixing medium for glitters
this is the clearly liquid glitter base
and I'm using my Mac reflex pearl and
I'm just putting a layer of that lit
base wherever I want the glitter and
then just pop the glitter on top and
just blend it out and make it look skull
and so say for Halloween
okay hardest part coming right now is
the teeth just make sure your lips are
really really light and then the inside
of your lips should be a dark gray or
black and then with my Mac penultimate
liner and wrap it black I'm just making
lines of where I want my teeth to be and
this is the hardest part to get them
sort of to actually look like real teeth
I'm taking my NYX jumbo pencil milk to
actually make them look white and make
them look like teeth and then with a
brush I'm just blending some of it up to
make it look more as if there's really a
sort of dimension in the look that guys

1/3 of my version on a colorful skull
makeup look for Halloween so you guys
