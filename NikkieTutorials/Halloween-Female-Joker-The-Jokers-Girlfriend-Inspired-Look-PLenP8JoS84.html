inspired by the Joker but today I'm not
the Joker himself I'm actually his
girlfriend and I want to take revenge on
Batman because he locks up my boyfriend
and he was never seen again and I'm kind
of pissed off so today I decided to be
the female Joker the Joker's girlfriend
so yeah I'm really excited about this
one if you want to know how to get this
female Joker Joker girlfriend of the
Joker at makeup tutorial then please
keep watching okay I'm gonna start off
with the scars so now if you would stay
true to the Joker you would make one
side sort of smaller and one side all
the way up because it's a few more Joker
in sort of a different interpretation on
it I'm just gonna put my scars however I
want them to be it's just however my
lover the Joker cut me while we were
kissing with a knife so for the scars
I'm gonna use my bin night nose and scar
wax and it looks like that and just to
get it out of the container and just
gonna use a spatula and I'm just taking
some notes and scar wax out of the box
and I'm just sort of making a worm out
of it and put it around my corners of my
mouth
you
okay now it's time to go crazy I'm gonna
take my white facepaint and this is by
kryolan TV pain stick in white and all
I'm gonna do is just take a sponge and
just make my entire face and neck white
but in the middle I'm gonna frown so I
get wrinkles and the white isn't gonna
touch that space so it looks messy
Batman you looked up my boyfriend
therefore I'm gonna kill your girlfriend
and head away okay pick the clean side
of her sponge and frown and just kind of
remove some of the pain to make it look
more worn and more messy then I also
have a black TV paint stick by Kryolan
and with that I'm gonna mess up my skin
even more for the eyes I'm just gonna
make it the same as a Joker but more
girly because I'm his girlfriend I'm
gonna take this black from my makeup
forever 12 color flash palette and that
it's going on to my eyes and just put
this on really messily and go up into a
point
and just kind of play with your fingers
and make it dirty again
then also under your eyes make it really
dirty and smoky and just kind of make
frown marks all over and then blend it
in with your skin making the entire face
more messy messy is the key word for
this look people not the football player
but messy like messy and then I'm going
to take this pinky sign pro xstream
color art in shocking pink and I'm gonna
apply this sort of like in the hollows
of my eyes and kinda all over it to give
it pink colorful girly accents and this
is water activated so I'm gonna activate
it with my mac fix+ oh that was totally
off
and I'm also going to do that with a bit
of purple and this is emesis purple also
by design Pro and just kind of play with
your fingers and kind of edit where you
want it and make it messy after and if
your black is creasing that is
absolutely okay it kind of adds to the
messy look but if you want it not to
crease and just add a powder on top okay
that just did the other eye for a lift
to you again done have to be neat at all
because it's gonna be a really messy lip
I'm gonna take my 52 berry and bright
neon pink lipstick and put that on the
middle of my mouth and then um sort of
carve it out go out like the Joker its
girlfriend and for a more red tone I'm
gonna use a runaway red by Mac
and then just go crazy with your hair
you can make your hair green or really
bright yellow to kind of wait normally I
would say never but because this is for
the Joker I'm gonna spray my hair a
little bit more yellow I'm probably
really gonna regret this later on I'm
probably gonna hate myself after this
because this will probably stain my
really light blonde hair but anything
for YouTube as I would say so yeah that
completes my girlfriend of the Joker
makeup tutorial I hope you can do it for
a full list of every single prodigy it's
