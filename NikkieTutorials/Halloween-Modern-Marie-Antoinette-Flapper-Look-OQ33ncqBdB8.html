tutorial inspired by Marie Antoinette
sort of as a flapper girl in the modern
days so you kind of want to see it as if
Marie Antoinette was still alive today
as a flapper girl walking on a Dior
Galliano inspired runway yes I must say
I really really really like this look I
hope you do as well and if you want to
know how to get this money
Toluca now please keep on watching so
the first thing you're gonna do is a PI
mister I list to prevent the eyeshadow
from creasing and I'm using my knife and
I'm using my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot
now I'm gonna take next entertain me lip
pencil and I'm just gonna apply this to
the inner part of my crease and just
make a line I'm gonna blend that up and
out and I'm gonna go over it with sugar
pills flame point eyes shadow just go up
into your nose line and blend it out now
I'm going to take Illamasqua medium i
pencil in interrogate and this is going
right into your crease also in the inner
part which is under that orange I'm
going to take my feets art eyes shadow
pellet and I'm gonna make my crease
darker with this color right here and
that color right there so just go in and
darken it up and blend it with the
orange
from my angle palette I'm gonna take
this warm brown red color and I will put
the name on my blog and I'm gonna mix it
a little bit with some of my brown
eyeshadows from Ivy's art pellet and
just start running that on the outer
part of your lower lash line and then
from that go straight out following the
direction of your waterline then format
these aren't eyeshadow pail I'm gonna
take this color that color and a little
bit of that color and I'm just gonna
wing the part all the way out to the
outer part of my temples and basically
all I'm gonna do is put this in my
crease and then wing it out and sort of
feather it out unto your temples that's
basically all so crease and then feather
out crease feather out I'm gonna take a
big angled brush and sort of shape it
across my forehead and temples so it
becomes a nice gradient effect now I'm
going to darken up my crease using a
dark brown for my face art eyeshadow
palette and kind of wing it out as well
as you go okay I'm going to blend that
orange out a little bit more using that
light color that we use in the temples
as well and all the way into that nose
line and then go back with your orange
to give it some more power again I'm
gonna highlight my brow bone using Mac's
nano gold and mythology for my eyelids I
will be using Mac's mythology again and
this Ben Nye Pearl Sheen eyeshadow in
mango
and I'm gonna fill the outer part up
using a dark brown and kind of filling
it in and blending it out for eyeliner
I'm just gonna use my blackjack flute
line by Mac and my C sign Pro number 22
eyeliner brush and all we're gonna do is
make an eyeliner pointing out and then
go back and fill it in and make a dot
under your eyes that's all
okay for the dot I'm gonna dip the back
of my eyeliner brush into my black track
fluid line then stamp it a couple of
times against my hand and then just
place it under your eye and then you get
the main shape up the dot and then you
just have to fill it in
okay now just gonna play my bed night
neutralize your cream crayon in a red
concealer and a for mascara I'm gonna
use my Hypnose by Lancome in waterproof
okay so for my eyebrows I'm just gonna
brush them up and you want to make sure
that they stay up the entire day this
will give it that nice sort of fashion
feeling and I'm not just gonna take my
Mac repet black pen ultimate liner and
just draw a really sort of Dior Galliano
eyebrow on I think it's totally okay if
they're not even that will give it a
really nice twist to the look because
this all is so precise and you can
really play up the look with your
eyebrows um I'm just gonna try to make
them even and if they end up not being
even I'm okay with that
okay fer my cheeks are first gonna
highlight with my net o gold eyeshadow
by Mac and a little bit of an extra
dimension skin finish in suburb and then
just right here on the highest point of
your face under your eyes and then I'm
also gonna go here and we're the blush
I'm going to use this crazy bright pink
by Illamasqua called Morel and you
really want this on the apples like
apples of your cheeks and make it really
round and compact yeah I won x-factor

flapper girl contest oh my god I wanna
thank mom my makeup my heels and my hair
