Halloween tutorial for 2013 and this is
sort of like this high-class lady who is
in her 20s and uh because like Hollywood
media life and everything just Hollywood
is plastic fantastic so as a present
from her daddy on her 21st birthday she
will get plastic surgery and today is
that day so this guy's is my Halloween
look which is a plastic surgery facial
map out of where I'm going to be cut in
and what's going to be lifted and what's
gonna be tucked and everything
inspiration for this look came from dr.
90210 and then I saw look really similar
on the sanity Diaries Instagram I love
him and that was just one and one is win
and two and why the half so if you want
to know how to get this plastic
fantastic look then please keep on
watching so I already went ahead and
fake bleaching my brows using my Kryolan
aqua color in ivory so that will make my
brows turn into this bleached goodness
if you want a full-on tutorial on how to
fake bleach your eyebrows in please
check out the link down below in the
info box because I've made a full
tutorial on it and when I'm not going to
do is a PI a base to my eyelids to
prevent my eyeshadow from creasing and I
what it's flying oh go away from pesky
fakes and what I'm going to use for that
is my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot for this
video the eyeshadows we'll be using are
from this Bobbi Brown rich chocolate eye
pellet which recently launched and I'm
absolutely in love with this baby for my
crease I will be using this color right
here with a little bit of this one as
well and what I'm going to do with that
is just define my crease and give it
some depth and warmth and you know me I
like to go in all the way and especially
with this look that will give it that
really hollow sort of to
too much work done look for the bottom
lid I will take this color only and be
quite generous with this color just make
it really thick and smoky underneath and
then with the slanted eye liner brush go
all the way to the inner corner now you
want to connect the bottom to the top
and you do it as by sort of placing your
brush on the bottom and then flicking it
up into the crease and then sort of keep
repeating that motion and then it
connects I'm going to blend out that
bottom portion quite a bit because I
want that to be really smoky and sort of
glamorous and sunken in and then also
for the top going to work a bit on the
depth and crease work just kind of keep
going and make it look perfect now I'm
going to take the lightest color off the
palate and highlight my brow bone with
that with this color right here I'm
going to bring a little bit more
definition into my crease and lower lash
line and with that light crease color
I'm going to blend that out again for
the lid and inner corners I will be
using this iridescent loose powder from
Mac called silver dusk this color is
absolutely stunning I do not know for
the life of me why I don't use this so
often because god damn it that's
gorgeous and then of course blend your
crease again and now pop some of it on
the inner corners and for my finishing
touch I will be using my makeup studio
dual effects and shine also on the inner
corners for my wedding liner we'll be
using my Catrice made to stay inside a
highlighter pen and just to open up the
eyes a little bit more and to finish the
eyes all you want to do now is curl the
lashes okay what you now want to do is
heavily contour your face because you
want to look like I said you already had
some work done before
instead of like in the process of going
to a newa surgery so I'm going to take
my NYX blush and taupe and start going
crazy
what this I was born with it and then
for a face highlight I'm actually going
back into silver dusk the one that is on
the lid as well and just go crazy it's
time for the lips and the lips are going
to be a little bit crazy because you
want to make them bigger than they
actually are and for that I'm going to
use my Mac lip mix in crimson because
that's my favorite red just keep in mind
that you want to go big
Sharon Needles I'm coming for you what
do you think that elbow implant
operation will be approved by the
government
yeah Cindy got er done last week in
Belgium I just hate the bit to finish
this lip off I'm gonna apply a gloss and
this is the Mac creme Sheen glass in
prepare to pleasure well I'll set
prepare to be cut in it's time to draw
the lines the procedure line sort of the
surgical lines and for that I will be
using my NYC High Definition liquid
eyeliner and it comes with one of those
felt tip pen tips tips to you I highly
suggest googling plastic surgery lines
on the internet because then you can see
the multiple lines that one can have
drawn on his face his her face so this
is all up to you where you place the
lines in where you want to be lifted and
tuck just have fun with it and I'm just
gonna give it a go I definitely need
some under two eyes I definitely want my
cheeks to be done
definitely the nose
I of course want a facelift
tuck that away doctor and I will finally
get rid of that ass on my chin and then
everybody completes my first Halloween
tutorial for 2013 this is my facial
plastic surgery map out where I want to
be cut and just be better with my life
