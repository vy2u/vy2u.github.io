tutorial for Halloween right here and
this is heard of my artsy fartsy
depressed clown this came from an idea
to be a set clown for Halloween and then
I found this new technique for Rick
Baker on YouTube and then this happened
and I am absolutely in love with it I'm
wearing contact I never do this so yeah
that is what I'm doing today if you want
to know how to get this depressed artsy
fartsy sad clown look then please keep
on watching so for this tutorial I don't
really have anything planned out the
only thing I know is that I want this to
end up looking like a sort of rained
down sort of goth sad clown so in the
city I'm just gonna follow my instinct
and kind of do what feels right um so
when there are parts where I'm not
really talking that's because I'm just
trying something out what I do know is
that I first want to do my base I have
nothing on just two contact lenses um
and I'm going to make my base whites but
then go over it with a black and yellow
to kind of make it look a little bit
more worn in a little bit more dirty and
what I will be using for that is my
design pro xstream color art in white
sensation then I also have the black one
which is called infinite black and then
I have my mehron peled in basic and it
has really awesome basic colors and from
that I'm going to take this yellow and
this burn to sort of mustardy color so
I'm just going to play so I'm just
starting off putting the white
everywhere and it doesn't really matter
if it's not that precise and neat
because we want this base to look messy
and sort of worn in so it's absolutely
okay if you messed this part
out a little brush marks like this right
here those are absolutely fine you kind
of want to go for that to make it look
more I don't know worn in okay what I'm
not going to do is take the yellow and a
little bit of that mustard color and mix
it with black and then you get this
really sort of gross sort of yellow sort
of dead yellow kind of look and then I'm
going to stipple that on with a
stippling brush all over my face for a
kind of gory messy depressed look and
then with your white go over it again
and again with a stippling brush and
then with the sponge just kind of mash
the two together now I'm going to go
into the black just make it messy I'm
also going to do a little bit of
contouring with this
and then with your white temper the
black a little bit down and that will
give you that really awesome sort of
sculpted look but still really messy but
I'm not gonna do is a trick that I
learned from Rick Baker here on YouTube
he in my eyes is a painting God and I'm
gonna follow his trick where he puts
some of the water activated paint on the
skin then makes it wet with like sort of
like a spritzer and then it runs down II
get this really awesome sort of Oh put
it on this part where you want it and
then spritz it and let it flow more and
then let it just oh look at that look at
it look at that oh that is so awesome
Rick Baker you're a genius black
and then spritz
I'm just going to play some off-camera
because my battery will die and then I
will be back so as you could see I had
quite some fun I first took my bubby
Brown rich chocolate pellet and I will
be using the two darkest shades right
here and with a big fluffy blending
brush I'm just going to put some
definition at the inside part of my
crease and then flicking it into the
nasal bone and while I'm at it I'm also
going to contour my nose a bit
I don't know why I did that because
clowns have red noses but I I'm gonna be
a tranny clown I don't know but just
keep on putting a definition on that
inside and then also here on the outside
and now it's time for the really torn
down sort of clown ask sort of stripe in
the middle of the eyes they always have
for them I'm going to take a bigger
eyeliner brush it looks like that and
I'm going to go back in my infinite
black by design Pro and when I first
going to do is draw a little line out
where I still want my opening to be for
my eye corner because I still want my
eye itself to be quite open and big go
all the way to the other side and what
you now want to do is do the scribbling
and that's really easy by just starting
quite big and literally scribble down
and then keep adding more until you're
satisfied with the outcome and then duh
we're going to spritz that with some
fixed plus and keep a tissue to kind of
control it so that is it for the bottom
and you also want to do that to the top
so sort of starting your crease in the
middle like that and then scribble
scribble scribble scribble for an inner
corner highlight I will be using my dual
effects a shine by makeup studio and
then just pop it here right on that very
very inner corner right there ooh pretty
for the actual eyelid I will be taking
this pigment by Mac called rose gold and
again I think that goes perfectly with
the color scheme ooh I love that color
so
much for my beretta will be using love+
i shadow by sugarpill and just going to
take my finger and again don't make this
neat because give yourself a clown desk
nose for the lips i just wanted to be
sad so I want my mouth corners to go
like this oh yes I'll a lot of good idea
of what I just wanted to do with the
cream let's do die with an eye shadow
just to be a little bit more safe and
then
and then add a little bit of that Joker
touch to it
and then with whites I'm going to
highlight a bit because you still want
to be a highlighted messed up depressed
clown and that guys completes this very
