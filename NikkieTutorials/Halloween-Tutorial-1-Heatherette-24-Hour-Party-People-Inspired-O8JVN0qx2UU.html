wait stop since he called it the Heather
at 24 Hour Party People the scenario
went like this I was at a Heatherette
party yeah I got killed while crying
with Heather at glittery party makeup on
yeah so anyways I hope you like my first
Halloween look I will try to do some
more I'm not exactly sure yet because I
have no idea so if you have any
questions or requests for a how we look
that you would like to see me do for you
then please leave them in a comment
section because I'm open to anything and
if I like the requests I will do some
more looks for Halloween so if you want
know who did this keep on watching the
link to Josh's videos in the sidebar so
check that out as well and thanks for
watching fight
okay guys the first step to this crazy
look is to decide where your life tears
are going to be um first thing about
this is just do it don't think about
where they need to be how they need to
be placed just place them and it will
all come to the tray it needs to be
messy so it doesn't have to be perfect
and just do it so I'm taking any black
you have um I'm taking a black from be
slotko's Linux which is nasty be and I'm
taking this Sigma one no 266 SS brush
I'm just taking some of that black and
now we're just going to decide where
it's going to be so let's sorry turn
number one
just place it like like like that but
just go with the flow
there there now you can not change it
anymore it's done they're on so for this
bruising purpley color I'm taking my Mac
Hello Kitty palette in to dolly and I'm
taking that color which is romping and
I'm taking a two 22 by Mac and take a
lot of it out just up dig it out dig it
up like that I'm just going to swipe
that all around those tears we're just
going all around them like you can see
that purple shading that is where you
want them just under your eyes as well
everywhere and once you have it
everywhere you're going in your crease
within in your crease and go pretty high
up because there's a lot of black coming
and you still want to see that pinkish
color now you're taking any brush you
wand and I'm taking this 252 by Sigma
and I'm taking that black and you're
going to put this onto your lid and it
doesn't have to be neat at all because
as you can see it's all blended out so
don't be neat at all and go in your
crease and just place it and then put it
on your lower lid as well and now you're
taking any blending brush you prefer I'm
taking the 224 but Sigma and I'm
blending that into the pink blend it in
then Len Len now we're taking a 219 by
Sigma and go back in that black color
and then just retrace those tears and
you don't exactly want to go all the way
down to the end because you want them to
be thinner you know what I mean so just
at the beginning shade them
because you don't want big blobs of
black at the end of intere because
that's not right that's just no no no no
you just don't do that you don't now I'm
going back with that um angle brush and
I'm just going to redefine those tears
and now it's the time to decide if you
want more if you want bigger tears just
redefine them and in between the big
tears like that you're going to apply
little strands of small ones
now you're going to take stars and
rockets with that 224 and really dig in
there again and this is for a nice
purple Sheen I always hate it stars and
rockets until this week I kind of play
with my makeup in the morning here as
well and um I was like I really need to
find a way to use stars and rockets and
I placed a super neutral car on my lid
and sketch in my crease with stars and
Rockets on top of it and it made this
brilliant purple brilliant purple I
loved it so if you don't know what to do
with your stars in the Rockets get some
sketch or a darker color put some stars
and rockets on top of it and it's a
gorgeous purple just try it out believe
me it's beautiful this is optional I
like to have a highlight on my brow bone
and on the inner corner so I'm taking a
252 by Mac and vanilla eyeshadow and
that is going on my Brabham I just like
it to have highlights on my brow bone I
don't know why and a little bit on that
inner corner right there
and for some more shimmer on that inner
corner I'm going to take effects and you
can take the same brush and that is
going on your inner corners and between
the purple and the highlight as well
right here that's basically it for the
shadows it's crazy but that's exactly
what we want now for the glitter if you
get littering your eye um do not rub it
if you rub it you would go now see
things on your eyes so take a q-tip make
it wet and place it on the glitter until
it lifts up and then the glitter is gone
do this with
that comes in your eye just a little no
for it to get glittering your eyes um
you need to use something that is going
to stick the glitter needs to stick to
your eyes um you can use the Mac Pro
gloss thingies I do not own that so I
got a little problem but I was like if
you can use a gloss you can use any
gloss you have so I'm taking my OCC
black tar which is tarred and I'm just
taking a little bit onto my hand a
little bit and I take any brush I want
and I take a kind of stiff one that
stigma to 52 and the glitters I'm going
to use are Hollywood like glamour doll
eyes it's a 3d silver I love glimmer doe
eyes rave also my glimmer doe eyes and
on reflex transparent heal so I'm taking
some of that lip tar just a little bit
and I'm putting that onto my under eye
and into the strands just go on to those
tears and then take some of that rate
that purple glitter use pet it on
it's working
just Pat it on and now you take some
more and take the 3d silver and place
just some random spots just everywhere
some random spots of 3d silver and then
if you like you can take some
transparent eel and just move that on
top of everything now if you do not like
all this glitter which I think it's a
little bit too much I take some of that
black eyeshadow again and just go on top
of them just reblocking it okay so the
glitter is on on the other eye and I
decided to take some glitter from the
transparent eel onto my lips as well so
that is it for this love for my lips I
want it to look dead I want it to be
like a kill beauti Mak whore so I took a
lot of concealer and blended it in and
powder on top to make them look really
dry so that is on my lips a little poof
in the hair fake hair you can curly her
hair string your hair put it in your
face like you've been beating off what
crazy so that is it my first Halloween
look totally inspired by Josh aka Petrie
lewd and I hope you like it and if you
