look inspired by Petri would once again
it's like a series like every look I see
him do it's like ah and I need to
recreate it and put my own spin to it so
I did it again today I looked at his
video a collection of looks or something
like that and he had this bright orange
with all these rhinestones and I was
like woah that is cool for Halloween so
what I did is made it like gold and
browns and what I'm gonna call this is
the underground treasure chest chick
it's a complete insane stupid sentence
but come on the underground on the mud
treasure chest chick Thank You Josh once
again for all your great ideas and
inspiration and the link to its
collection of looks is in the sidebar
and this is also going as a video
response to that video so if you want to
know how I did this then please keep on
watching and yeah thanks for watching
bye
okay the Spartans look off you want to
apply a base to your lids to prevent
your eyes from creasing and I use three
bases which is insane I know I use my
miss Hammond eyeshadow base I use Mac's
painterly paint but I cannot find it
anywhere um and I use I want to add a
jumbo pencil in milk and that is what I
applied to my lids for a base and let's
get start with the shadows
I had a first color for this look it's
gonna be wood winged by Mac and I take a
239 and I grab them I'm gonna put this
on the inner corner going halfway in or
two thirds of the way in actually
because it will be covered anyways so
just go in a little bit up just a little
bit and just keep putting it on and then
I'm going to take bronze and take the
other side of that brush and I'm taking
bronze by Mac and this is going on the
outer corner and blending it towards the
middle to get a nice dark and a lighter
gold color which is really pretty I
really love that so after I fund those
edges I'm gonna take a 224 by Sigma and
what I'm now gonna do is take some of
that bronze and I'm just going to put
that into the crease and I'm going on
the outer corner with this up to my brow
all the way up to my brow go all the way
up and just blend it in into the creases
bone then take a little bit of lit
winged and go on top of that and blend
it even further on to get brow like you
got this shape so you see a little bit
of your brow bone like in the middle
that is what you want to have
and I blend it down and this look needs
blending as you can see it needs a
flawless Lenny you can just do that by
thrilling windshield wiper motions just
move that brush and blend it select the
brush up really well and then go in
d'être for ease of wormwood and I have
it on my fake eyelashes thingy because
it has a bag and I hate it and I really
need a container for it but I don't have
them so I'm thinking that and that is
going to darken on like outer V and
crease even more so take warm wood and
put that on the outer corner and into
your crease now I'm gonna take another
224 brush by Sigma this is from the
travel kit I'm going back in bronze and
now we're going to put that under the
lower lid and now it's time to make that
underground send muddy look that's what
you want and go all the way in and or
not everywhere you want it to look good
and if you make mistakes just take a
clean finger and rub it out of it to
blend it now take some wing and apply
that as well and this will make a nice
gold chain as you probably can see a
really nice gold to just keep blending
blending and blending
now we're really going to darken up that
lower part of the eyes so I'm gonna take
the 224 brush again and I'm going in
sketch my mac heavily heavily heavily
heavily and then it's going below and
you keep adding this until you have the
intensity that you like but I'm gonna go
in a black color and this is the black
I'm gonna use this by you slop cosmetics
and I'm just gonna take any brush I want
for that and I'm just going to darken my
lower part of my eyes and you want to
drag this down a bit more because the
rhinestones will sparkle more on that
darker base that is what I think so you
want to apply the black a little bit far
down and of course you can take a
blending brush and blend it all out and
make it nice and even now we're going to
take a 235 by Sigma and go in vanilla
and this is going to be the highlight
color and you're going to apply that to
around there on your brow bone like the
middle spot I'm still open and then
blend it further to your nose like so
and then you're going to put this as a
inner corner highlight as well to open
up the eyes with it so that's basically
it for the shadows I'm now going to take
a q-tip and smoke it a little bit off
with um eyelash glue
this is duo I use that and I spread them
on the middle of my lid and then take
some neck antique gold glitter applying
it with a brush and because of the
eyelash glue it will Sparkle even more
and we will sit there the entire evening
so I'm gonna do that
I'm gonna line my eyes and my waterline
and then I'm going to show you how to
put on the rhinestone so be right back
so excuse me my brother is playing in
the other room so you might hear
anything on my lips I have concealer I'm
Mac myth and that basically completes
the Petri wood inspired underground
treasure chest chick yeah if we
celebrate Halloween in in denial and
soon I'm gonna wear this because I feel
like a treasure chest above the ground
well I should be underground so I hope
you liked it if you have any questions
leave them in the comment section below
and Thank You Josh
for your great inspiration so bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
