Halloween video or Halloween ish because
I'm going to start a Harry Potter
inspired series um these series will be
really dramatic not wearable it is
wearable but I wouldn't go shopping in
it and it's all Harry Potter inspired
and in every Harry Potter movie there is
lightning and storm like in every video
there is there's always a big storm
going on with lightnings and I was
totally inspired by that today plus this
is one of my last Halloween videos so
the look I'm going to call this is the
queen of thunder and lightning slash
Harry Potter series inspired so I hope
you liked it if you have any questions
after this video leave them in the
comment section I hope you liked it and
please stay tuned to watch this video so
yeah I
okay so now that I have bangs again I'm
first going to pin away those mangoes
mangoes so to start off this look you
want to apply a base and I'm
experimenting with a new base right now
which is the Catrice stay on I shadow
base so I first up like that then I took
some peyote Paint Pot and I'm going to
apply some NYX milk just to the lid
first off I'm going to take gesso I'm
hitting pan this like crazy and I'm
taking a 239 which is dirty but we will
use it anyways and I take a lot of the
gesso and that is going on the inner
corner so just pack that on to the inner
corner and you really want this to be a
basic white now I'm going to take glam
Couture mystery which is beautiful so
I'm just taking mystery which is the
dark blue with gold glitter and taking
just a little bit on the other side of
that 239 and this is going onto your lid
as well and you're going to blend it
slightly with the white color just a
little bit and then move it outwards and
keep patting so you will not get any
fallout
now take any black matte color you own
and take a 217 and this is going on the
outer corner blending it in the blue and
then we're going into the crease with
this and now I like to take a different
brush which is the CVS on dual brushes
in the bigger size one and I take just a
little bit of black and I'm making that
line and just lining it out a bit
and then just take your black and go in
your crease and blend this with it you
want that to go all the way up to your
brow this looks crazy I know but you
really want it to look like that and
then just blend it into your crease and
blend it out and keep some space free
for your highlight right here
now I'm going to take a sigma 224 brush
from from the travel kit and I'm taking
scandalous which is another pain and
this is bright turquoise and I'm just
taking some of that and I'm just going
to blend those edges with this car and
going down to the lower lid as well just
a little bit and then blend it between
the brow bone and the black is well
and now I like to take my 275 by Sigma
and on vanilla by Mack love this color
and I'm taking that and that is going on
the problem and just that space where
you have brow bone left basically and
then I like to make it a little bit more
move with a little bit of gesso or a
little bit a lot a lot of a little bit
that it's going on the brow bone as well
for this part I put the Lighting's on
the lower part of my face but on this
side it's more going on the side of my
face if you know what I mean so I just
take a little bit more of turquoise
mystery and another color called blue
sky and I'm just going to put them
everywhere I want to give that
lightening some contrast so I'm just
going to put this everywhere I want
around my eye and take the bright blue
color to highlight a bit and then I'm
going to show you how to put on those
lightnings so just put those three
bluish colors everywhere you want and
then you will be right back or I will be
right back
now go ahead and take some gesso and
highlight the outer corners of your
storm okay it's time for the Lightning's
on your face I'm going to take my Miran
basic palette which has a white core I'm
going to take some eye drops and wetting
weten make that white wet and then I'm
taking a angle brush my Sigma where are
you the brush and then I'm going to just
put lightnings everywhere I want so I'm
going to speed this up a little bit and
enjoy
never do last step you want to do with
shadows and all that gets up I'm going
to take max transparent teal glitter and
I'm not going to make them wet or
anything I'm just taking a brush I'm
just going to put that everywhere where
I have the Lightning's because it will
give them the effect of like sorry
okay so I'm going to put on some mascara
liner um okay so I'm going to put on
some mascara a liner and my lips which
are going to be probably really light
again and I will be right back for my
lips I want it nude with a touch of
drama so what I did was nude nude nude
Newton purpley pink lips
and how I got this was using OCC D if I
use OCC lip tar in catracha and
feathered and I took a lot a lot of
feathered and just a teeny bit of
Patricia mix it all together with the
lip brush put it on and then because I
want to gloss for this because it kind
of dries up my lips the OCC lip tars
I took a gosh um 101 lip them in the
blue color and I got this because of
what's I was on to nickel witchy he
raved about this and I was like so that
completes this Queen of thunder and
lightening / Harry Potter inspired look
I really hope you like it this will be
one of my last Halloween videos but yeah
I cannot help it it goes by so fast a
year and I hope you like this look and
