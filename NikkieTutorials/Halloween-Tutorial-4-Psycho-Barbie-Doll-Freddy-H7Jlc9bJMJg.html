Barbie Freddy
Barbie Freddy Freddy the Barbie because
um I got these lashes and when I opened
them there was one name in my head and
it was Freddy and I don't know why but I
love Freddie
so this is my Freddy Barbie look Freddy
dilash
beast was part of my eye and I call him
Freddie
you want to apply your base I'm going to
use um my name is Helen eyeshadow base
my pan we paint on my Mac and what
external pencil in milk to start off I'm
going to apply gesso by Mac all on the
lid just apply it heavily heavily
heavily on to that lid
now I'm going to take the Sigma's 266
and um max romping which is that love my
fingers right in it the pink and I'm
taking that and we're going to make a
line for the crease
now you want to take a bigger brush and
blend it out so take more of that pink
color and then blend it upwards
now I take that same angle brush and
take and take max push the edge pigment
and I'm taking that on the brush and
we're going to darken up that cup crease
so we're going to follow that beginning
that line and just darken it up
and I like to take that bigger brush
again and the same as with the pink take
purple and blend it up not completely
because you still want to see that pink
I'm going to take my 275 bye
Jessup X is 75 by Sigma again and go in
gesso and this is going to be our brow
highlight so go ahead and put that on
your brow blend down that pink of it
just flip it now you can reapply all the
colors so I'm going to reapply to gesso
the pink purple the why the gesso to
paint the purple why yeah pretty low
part of your eye you're going to take
black eyeshadow or black um eyeliner and
I'm taking that same angle brush and
what you're going to do is like make a
new lower lid so I'm taking any black
matte eyeshadow I have and I'm not going
to talk about doing this because then I
will fail and all that stuff so I'm just
going to make a new lower lid
so now go ahead and make lashes so you
can add false lashes I wish I had them
because that would be a gazillion times
easier but I don't have lower lashes so
I'm just going to draw them on but if
you have them put them on if you don't
just draw them on
like that now I'm going to take my eggs
jumbo pencil in milk and line my
waterline like that and then I'm going
to take me run me run and I take some
white and I take a brush and put that
white between the new lower lash line
and between my real eyes so right in
this face I'm going to make it what with
the UM cane
Oh what now is left is to put lighter on
your lower lid and mascara and these
big-ass false lashes which I love
remember the video I did on contact
lenses from edited Holland they also
send me these o-m-g I am in love like
look at them the end they are nicer they
where they feel nicer than normal fall
session
but they are so comfy like there's a
little beast on the spot of my eye and I
call him Freddie
so yeah put Freddie on and then I will
be back so that completes the Freddie
Barbie look Freddie the lashes Freddie
my lips I add a color crafted by Mac and
some clear lip gloss I hope you liked it
I look cross-eyed I know but I like it
I'm a cross-eyed Freddie Freddie</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
