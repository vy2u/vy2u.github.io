this look and this one is another
Halloween one and this is more of a
zombie dead girl look I really really
really like it
the only downside to this look is the
white lips make my teeth look insanely
yellow which they are yellow but not
that yellow I hope you like it and oh my
god
have you heard Lady Gaga's new song with
this I feel like I'm her with the song
like
so for the face I'm going to begin with
I'm taking my main room palette and
taking that white color and a stippling
brush I'm going to put that white all
over my face and then um we will go from
there so I just put the white all over
your face
so keep a few spots on your face your
own um skin color so this will look like
it's not completely what so it's more
natural ish so just do not make
everything light so like mainly keep it
on your t-zone and into your um cheeks
what you can do now is take some of your
foundation and blend it into the edges
of your skin and this will make it look
like you're in the process of like
becoming white while you're dying well
you're already dead but like you're
turning white yeah this is just optional
just just do it if you like
and then of course you can go back with
the white and we what in everything now
for contouring your cheekbones and all
those areas I'm going to take max push
the edge pigman and you just want to
take a little little bit and you really
want to build up this color like you
don't want to put too much purple at
once because if you do you can mess
things up and you really don't want that
now if you like you can even make them
darker by adding some black just below
it
now I'm going to take Beast cloud
cosmetics blush in number 30 it's like a
bright bright pink and this is just a
blend of add just just a little bit
don't put too much on because then you
will look alive and we don't want that
so just a little bit to blend out those
edges
especially here like in here it can be a
bright bright paint but here you want to
keep it like really light so go ahead
and do that now you can put it at the
temples as well to blend it out a bit
now I'm taking a bit of gesso eyeshadow
with any brush you like and I'm just
going to set that right on my face
how does that happen the first eye is
already there we're going to do the eyes
so you want to apply a base to prevent
them from creasing of course even with
Halloween you don't want a crease eyelid
you don't you don't so what I did was
apply the Catrice stay on I to the base
which I'm still trying out my pan only
paint but and NYX jumbo pencil in milk
so the first color we're going to work
with is Max beauty mark and I'm taking a
239 and because of that my X jumbo
pencil milk you will still see a little
bit of the red glitter
and again I'm going to take max push the
edge pigment and taking a Sigma 224 and
I'm taking the pigment and this is going
in your crease and right in here to make
it look like it's hollow so the right
word I don't know oh my god
and then just take it and go up into
this space here and up to your brow bone
and then just blend it together like
that you know like it's like sunken in
you want that effect
now I'm going to take max romping again
and I'm taking a Mac 222 and this is
going in the edges of the look so
between the brow bone and all those
edges of the black so around here to
just around the design you know you you
get ready and then take them and put it
on the inner corner here as well this
will make you look even better better
better now for the brow bone highlight
I'm going to take gesso and my brush
which I can out there is my favorite
highlight brush the Sigma 275 that's
probably right that is just going on
your problem and blend a little bit of
that purple color down just a little bit
and then of course you can go ahead and
reapply all the colors from our lower
lid I'm going to take cutie marks again
and just smudge it under your eyes like
crazy
and then what I like to do to make it
look like I've been really tired as a
zombie I'm tired of being it I'm going
to take a little bit of romping and a
little bit of push the edge and a little
bit of beauty mark and make like um
backs under my eye like I'm really
really tired and take push the edge
pigment and smudge that under that
beauty mark
so that's a pretty shadows I'm now going
to line my upper lid and open my
waterline with black track fluid line
you can add false lashes I'm not going
to just because I'm lazy and I'm going
to wash it off after ways anyways so um
afterwards anyways right back
rich zombie smiles so yeah you can
choose to do new it's like totally
completely white like I do and like I
always do with nudes because I love
nudes but you can also take it crazy put
purple lipstick on black lipstick
wrapping it doesn't matter with what you
like it's all about what you want and
that completes this zombie look gosh
this white lips really makes my teeth
look so yellow look so yellows like
search for the differences I hope you
liked it umm I really like this this is
one of my most favorite Halloween looks
ever I feel so dead but so live and so
creepy and so cool but I'll collect it
