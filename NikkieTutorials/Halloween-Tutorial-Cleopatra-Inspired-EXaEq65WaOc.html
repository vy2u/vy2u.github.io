Halloween tutorial on and now let me
break it down for you because I'm Dutch
and I have no idea how to pronounce it
it's either Cleopatra Cleopatra I'm just
gonna call her Cleo I just wanted to go
all the way out with some gold glitter
on the lid and some really big eyeliner
and some fresh pink nude lips so uh yeah
so if you want to know where the tips
and please people watching the for this
book I decided to do my foundation last
and eyes first because I'm gonna use
some glitter and I'm scary just how that
it's gonna drop in my face and then I'm
gonna look like cash on your nose like
what Cleo I have a video on how I do my
brows it's kind of old so I will put a
updated brow routine up very soon but
for now I will just do my brows so just
do your brows the way you'll always do
your brows just a little bit darker okay
so I already applied my neck soft ochre
Paint Pot as a base to prevent the
eyeshadow from creasing and that's step
number two after the best yes so the
first color going to take is next amber
light and I'm gonna put that on my lid
then i'm going to take LMSs Wolfe
eyeshadow and I'm sort of going to cut
the crease I'm gonna make a line in my
crease then I'm gonna go all the way in
so first just make a line all the way
and then I'm gonna make this brown as
well like the outer third of my eye now
I'm going to mix MEK cranberry and
Illamasqua sandwich and I'm going to put
that unlike the inner crease really
lightly put that in your inner crease
for some purple haze and then the rest
of the crease are going to blend out
with next
quark that run
okay I'm not going to take wolf again
and put that on my entire lower lash
line and I'm going to warm that up with
next red brick eyeshadow the glitter
we're going to use is this one from my
candy cosmetics and this is candy coin
and it's really a like a blond gold
glitter now to make the glitter stick to
my lids I'm going to take this la splash
eyeshadow sealer face it's really sticky
so the go there really sticks to it so
I'm going to apply the glitter to the
middle of my lid and then taking the
width of my iris headed on where I want
the glitter to be and then I'm going to
take my glitter and just Pat it on top
okay now it's time for the hardest part
which is the eyeliner the eyeliner
ghani's is my favorite the Inglot
eyeliner gel met in 77 which is black
and I'm not really going to talk through
this eyeliner the thing is you just want
to start up with a really basic eyeliner
on top and make it like a cat eyeliner
and go out then I'm going to make this
point on the inner corners and instead
of going to my waterline I'm going to go
below my eye and make a line and then
wing it out and connect the other one
okay what I'm not going to do is curl my
lashes and apply some mascara okay I'm
not going to highlight my brow bone with
makeup studios my favorite makeups -
yeah I should have ivory gold and I'm
just going to put that on my brow bones
for that really nice shine that really
unique gold shine that it gives it's
perfect with this look
I'm not going to do my foundation and
stuff normally I don't feel this that
this is kind of weird but the financial
I'm using is my favorite Mac face and
body c1 and I'm just going to apply that
with my favorite foundation brush and
this is the buffing brush from Real
Techniques you don't want to go over
your black eyeliner because if you do
that everything what you just did was
useless so be careful that you don't
touch it then I'm going to set that with
a powder to make it last all day long
I'm never going to do some contouring
because as clearly you want to look like
sculpted as possible for that I'm going
to take my ex or NYX taupe and
Illamasqua the name fade it off how cool
is that
okay then far hilivin gonna tank my
favorite highlighter which is ivory gold
from a makeup studio and I'm just gonna
put that like underneath the line for a
nice cheek highlight okay so the
lipstick I'm using is this NYX or NYX
lipstick in strawberry milk and I'm just
gonna Pat that on for because everything
is really brown and beige e and bronzy I
kind of want to live it up because too
much Brown and Bruns can really make a
skin look very very old and very sad
basically so you kind of want to give it
that fresh pop with a pink somewhere so
either it's blush or right on the lip
and I'm gonna use it above it so yeah
