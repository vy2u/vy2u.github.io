on my last Halloween tutorial for this
year I was totally inspired by all the
do your runway shows of like history and
everything so yeah it's sort of drag not
really it's sort of drag but I really
like this so if you want to know how you
can get this do your runway
inspired hello you look then please keep
on watching so the first thing I have to
do is block my brows and for that I'm
going to use a glue stick or people
called it the frit stick so I'm going to
use that right now so just put the glue
and my brows to flatten them down and
then just smooth it over and then you're
going to let that layer dry and then
you're going to add another layer okay
then it's time for a foundation not for
foundation I'm going to go just I am
pasty whatever and I'm going to go even
more right so I'm going to take max face
and body foundation in white and mix it
a little bit with my own color which is
c1 and I'm going to mix the two together
to give me like that pill like white
okay now I'm going to set it with a
powder and the part I'm using is Kryolan
translucent powder just to remove all
the shine and make it really mad and
stuff okay then it's time for the
eyebrow and for that I'm going to make
them black and I'm gonna take max flute
line in black track and just a slanted
eye liner brush so in the front I'm
gonna go a little bit up for that like
um it's sort of an angry feeling and
then kind of go all the way out in a
thin stripe you want to keep them really
thin and really artsy fartsy
so first thing I'm going to do is apply
a base to everywhere sort of where the
eyeshadow is going and what I'm using is
my soft ochre Paint Pot from Mac I'm
going to take a matte black eyeshadow
this is carbon from Mac and I'm just
gonna put that on the inner corners and
outer corners of my eyes then I'm going
to take this in my paladin I have I'm
going to take this color right I don't
know the number right now but I will put
it on my website because tutorials calm
and with the color I'm going into the
inner crease like that so kind of leave
a spot for the highlight open right
there and then I'm just really gonna
like blast that into that inner corners
right here
if you ain't my no streak you will
definitely want to kill this and I'm
gonna take a big blending brush and make
it softer now with a really thin
eyeliner brush I'm going to take add the
black again and mix it a little bit with
a bright purple and this is sugar pills
poison plum and I'm going to make a line
underneath my eye for where the silver
glitter is going to be and then I'm
going to take two Purple's I'm going to
take sugar pills poison plum again and
I'm going to take next thick one and I'm
going to blend that under the black line
we just made
okay and then with the poison plum only
I'm going to go at the outer part of the
crease right here I'm going to take a
blending brush and kind of connect the
blue and the purple together above your
crease now we're going to mix illamasqua
savage and maybe and I'm going to put
those right here on the outer part they
kind of want to use that as a blush so
I'm gonna go down with that and then the
blending of course and then kind of go
out to your temples and blend it there
as well you gotta want to see this as a
high placed blush and then I'm also
gonna wipe that into the brow bone right
here then I'm going to take a really
really bright pink and this is a sugar
pills dolly pop and with that I'm kind
of gonna make a highlight but then with
a bright pink so right here I'm just
gonna place that love that okay then
we're gonna make this lower part a
little bit more smoky and black so I'm
gonna just take my black and smoke it
all out and I'm going to take two really
bright yellows ones I'm taking our
goldenrod from Mac and then this really
really bright one and this is sugar
pills butter cupcake I'm gonna put those
on the inner corners right here you can
kind of place a really sloppy because
that kind of adds to the look in my
opinion now I'm not going to do is take
a silver a liquid eyeliner this is Meg
super slick liquid liner in a nocturnal
nocturnal and the glitter that I'm
putting on is from makeup studio and if
I can find this is the jewel effects in
sparkle I normally always use shine but
Sparkle is more glittery
so the glitter in his room is insane
Kesha is killed in this room right now
okay for the last part of the eyeshadow
on the middle of the lid I'm going to
put a brown this is next mystery and
then to really get that showgirl effect
on top I'm going to use some glitter I'm
gonna use Mac's reflex antique gold
reflex glitter and I'm going to put that
on with some hairspray
ah now Kesha and her sister died in this
room because glittery er okay so that is
it for glitter and all the eyeshadows
and all that stuff but I'm now going to
do is take my water paints that I have
from v-sign Pro these are the same as
may run do and all the other brands it's
just water activated like paint for your
face and I'm going to take white and
black and what I'm going to do is take
two toothbrushes so a white one and the
black one and what I'm going to do is
kind of spritz some like paint splatters
onto the eye I got this trick from a
teacher of the skull disser and Buchan
me so I'm really thankful that she
showed us this little tip get your
makeup wipes ready because you're gonna
have to clean your hands because they
get really really dirty
so this is what happens after you've
done that one of the last things that
I'm doing is put some our brine stones
around the look and I'm just going to
use some random size rhinestones just
take any silver Isis they have and is
just gonna put them on with eyelash glue
and I'm going to put these crazy lashes
on there from Illamasqua
and they are called grandeur now for
lips it's absolutely your choice what
you do with them on they can make them
new you can make them like why you can
make them really dark what I'm gonna do
is make them like a really dark burgundy
red sort of with the purple hints of it
so yeah that is my D your now it just
looks like a cake at least that is my D
your runway show inspired galaxy look I
kind of made it my own by making it a
galaxy look I absolutely love all the
Dior show that I just love to do so yes
