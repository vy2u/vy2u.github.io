with goddesses so I want that real like
glowy skin so the first thing I'm going
to do is grab my foundation that I use
every day this is essence day all day
long dust and makeup then because I'm
really really like I'm going to grab
some white foundation I do this every
single day to match my skin tone and
just for a little bit of bronze mist
I'm going to grab the makeup studio
shimmer effect in bronze it's a bronze
foundation and it will make any
foundation glowy then grab a q-tip and
mix everything together and then grab
anything that you want
apply your foundation with I'm going to
grab my new Sigma round top kabuki brush

got it and then just first get that
foundation on your skin and then with
the brush blended in

hollows a little bit less oranjee so I'm
going to grab corduroy eyeshadow and
with the same brush which is a Mac which
is a stigma on 165 just make it a little
more yeah once you've done that you're
going to apply some blush I'm going to
grab Mac spring sheen which is an
amazing color with a gold Sheen I'm
going to grab that and put that right
here so not really on the apples of my
cheeks but more here now I want to
highlight my cheekbones a bit with a
shimmery color because I love that like

glowy skins damn those bitches damn I'm
going to grab my favorite highlighting
