first Halloween tutorial of 2010 so
today we're going to do a listen and um
yeah I was inspired it's not really
recreated of course it's inspired by her
skin color her eye color her costume a
costume you can't use black lips with
this and stuff she has red but I'm gonna
really feel it
she had these horns and stuff just gotta
step into that there Lawrence the green
is inspired by her eyes purple inspired
by her skinned black inspired by her
heart a witch she doesn't have a heart
it's a big Disney song really singing
but maybe I can be maliciousness nice
and be like are you doing dude what are
you doing keep on watching
oh I have really live brows already but
if you have darker brows then please
cover them up with like a glue stick
method or the scar wax or anything like
that I'm just gonna do one with
concealer I'm gonna grab this nc15
concealer by Mac just gonna put my
finger in it
and go over my brows so then I'm gonna
grab this Mac um mascara the Prolog
leche in bare lash and it is a nude
mascara which I love and I'm just going
through my brows with it so now it's
time for some new brows I'm gonna grab
this charcoal Brown net eyeshadow by Mac
as a base because it will be black in
the end and I'm just gonna start at my
point of my own brow and go up
around there and then from there I'm
going to take it down
like that now that you have a rough line
you're going to make it look a little
bit more real so fill this in right
there and make this a little bit thicker
you
and that is my main shape and now I'm
gonna take a black eyeshadow and just
make the entire brow darker then take a
brush like this again and just brush
your own hairs up to make it nice and
blend it in for the eyes I'm gonna start
off at the base this is the Michael
taught new cream eyeshadow and then I'm
topping on apply slim and 1x milk so
yeah the first thing we're going to do
is we're going to take a brush like this
and a black eyeshadow I'm using carbon
from Mac and you're going to line your
upper lash line so just start by
wiggling it back and forth of the upper
lash line I'm gonna start off with the
black again and then going in that
crease and then when the inner corner or
just put it in as well connect and then
from the inner corner you're going up a
bit see kind of like a blob you can
always take a q-tip and clean that up
like that now you want to make it more
intense and you're gonna blend it then
I'm going to take a 217 my Mac and
contrast contrast and I'm just gonna
blend that line out also from this in a
corner go into that direction
blend it in a bit around hassle to it
now I'm going to take a brush like this
this is the Sigma 226 and I'm going into
nocturne out and this is one of my
favorite Mac colors and this is going
right above and on top of that contrast
just to give it more of a purpley
feeling since Maleficent is this like
purpley lady with a dress that's purple
also don't be scared to just go all the
way up to your brow in here no problem
at all then I'm going back with that 217
but this time I'm going into a black
color so two carbon and just intensify
all the blackness in your look for the
highlighting on the Gratz Anila and just
put that on these spaces that aren't
covered yet I'm going to grab this a Mac
pikmin in chartreuse and that is the
color for her eyes and that is going
onto our inner corners and the lid so
start in your inner corners and go in
they can always go back with a brush
like this and make the lashline black
again then for the lower lid it's
actually really fun we're going to start
off with a black track fluid line my max
is the black one and we
a broth like this one you're going to
line your waterline and then with the
same brush as we put that base of the
crease with I'm gonna go back into a
black carbon and I'm just going to make
it crazy so I'm gonna start right here
like that and then keep that the
dimension and it's going down keep that
and go all the way to there so just
follow it
and then once you are there you can see
that this one is higher than this I'm
just going to connect it Donna grep is
222 my Mac and plumage or plumage or I
don't know what the freakin you
want to call it and I'm just gonna grab
that color like that and just blend it
down then as a last finishing touch I'm
gonna grab some glitter to make it a
little bit more Halloweenish I'm gonna
grab a makeup studio glitter in pearl
lilac and it's an amazing um
transferring glitter with pearl glitters
oh it's you see the glow off I love it
I'm just gonna put that right here right
now I'm gonna apply some mascara I'm
gonna use the makeup studio maximum
volume I love this mascara it's my
favorite one um you can apply some fake
eyelashes but I think that will make
this look too much of a drag queen and
then we will be back for the lips okay
for lips you can choose to make them
black or really really really dark I'm
not going to see because then I feel
like I'm too much of a drag queen so I'm
gonna make them extremely nude gonna
start off with my lippy right fine Mac
then I'm gonna grab miss a lipstick by
Mac
and then what you can always do is take
the pearl I like glitter don't you have
around here and pass that over your lips
so that completes this malicious and
Disney first Halloween tutorial of 2010
