Rouge Halloween tutorial and um let's
grab the the bras out the thumbs out and
your skirts and go crazy so today is
more Rouge um one of my most favorite
movies ever um when it came out in 2001
I believe I was I was seven when that
movie came out and then when I was eight
it came on the TV and this dude the the
like circus guy the the one who sings
can can can that guy um he was so scary
to me oh my god
but then when I turned um 15 that's
already a year ago um I saw it again I
felt and loved the songs the story
Nicole Kidman you and McGregor um so
yeah so now that it's Halloween time
again I couldn't let Malloy watch out um
yeah today we're doing woman Rouge and I
went out with the glitter I went out
with the pink I went out with the
everything um yeah so if you want to
know how I did this then please keep on
watching and I will see you guys in
about two seconds but that I already
filmed so I will see you guys uh I don't
know Wednesday when I found a new
tutorial it's a purse the first thing to
do is apply a base to your eyelids to
prepare your eyes so increasing during
Halloween and um I use mine Michael
taught a cream eyeshadow in nude and
this is my favorite eyeshadow base ever
the first thing I'm going to do is I'm
going to grab Embarq
by Mac and a brush like this to line my
upper lash line and then when I've done
that I'm going to grab a pencil brush
like this and make a rounded smokey eye
shape so I'm going right in like that so
that's what we're going to do is first
then when you have that line just go
with this brush into an markcaswell and
then go around into your crease and go
all the way in in this inner corner you
really want it dark so go into crease
and go all the way in
now you want to take a brush like this
and blend a baby boy out so I'm going to
grab some and work again
on the brush and say it
and whatever you're doing with colors
and stuff just make sure you keep
everything round because then you get
this round shape Iran your iron then
there's a whiner kicks out I really love
that now we're going to play with some
color I'm going to grab this color
called sushi flower by Mac and with the
same brush I just wiped it off on my
paper towel
I'm just gonna grab that color and you
want to smoke it around the brown so
right above the brown go with that sushi
flower and don't be scared to go all the
way here and under your eyes and in here
you just want everywhere with brownies
you want to go around it and here as
well and you want to go out of the box
and go out of here and go crazy and with
your cheekbones you have this like like
diagonal card follow that with the pink
so follow that highlight bony thingy
make that pink as well then because I
personally thought that this was kind of
flat and uninteresting I'm going to take
a sugar pill love+ and this is a fiber
red color and with a brush like this to
sigma2 26 i'm going to go into the color
and that's going between the brown and
the sushi flower just to give it some
more edge so go all the way in and apply
that red around and under as well
and then I want that sushi flower to go
out extra strong so I'm going to grab a
Sigma 227 and this is a really really
dense and thick brush and I'm going to
go back into sushi flour and just really
intensify that around the red color that
we just placed okay what I'm going to do
now is going to grab Embarq again and
take it a little bit further into my
eyelid now I'm going to grab carbon
which is just the matte black my Mac and
make it even darker that crease now for
no lower leg we're going to make it
really dark and smoky so I'm going to
grab this brush which is probably one of
my favorite brushes by Sigma this is to
214 I'm gonna put a link in the bottom
bar where I can get these brushes and
I'm going to go into Embarq and just
line this all over your bottom lash line
I really want to make that Brown under
really really smoky so I'm going to grab
a 217 going embarq and just smoke it
down sugar pills a plum or poison plum
and that's a bright purple color and
with that 226 again right here I'm going
to go into that purple and this is going
to be smoked under this brown so right
here the purple goes
ambolyn it on top I'm going to punt
things a little bit more I with this
brush again so just take it and just
wing it out and brush it out and do your
stuff with it you can also go back into
the sushi sour and make that um nice and
vibrant again and then because I really
wanted a cool golden shine I'm gonna
grab the prettiest highlighting color I
have ever seen in my life
this is the makeup studio Lemire
eyeshadow and ivory gold and this is ah
this is amazing
it gives the most beautiful golden Sheen
ever look at it way oh oh pretty hell
good you can get it at UM this link
right here well that's nice to have it
on my nose I'm first going to start off
with the easiest things I'm going to
grab a very pink reflex by Mac and I'm
just going to grab my ring finger dip it
in and you're going to put that over the
sushi flower where you um have your
cheek highlight bone socket thing I'm
gonna grab melon pigment by Mac and I
got this do circuit and the thing is
with this pigment you don't want to be
neat with it I just take my ring finger
I go into that pigment and I take the
lid and squish it onto my finger and
what you want to do is you want to like
punch it in that inner corner as I did
right there you don't want it to be nice
and blended you just want it to be
punched there and just punch it in that
inner corner punch punch punch
okay you can like remove a little bit
and play with it but don't make it too
neat because you really want it to be
like that mess
the highlight on the inner corner it's
time for the red glitter my favorite
part of this entire look this really
makes it I'm going to grab a max
eyeliner mixing medium and the glitter
I'm going to use is by heavily naturals
this is ruby slippers so it's just a red
glitter and take a synthetic brush and
first paint a coat of this on your lid
like where you want the pigment to be
and now you take some more onto your
brush of that mixing medium and then
just go into the glitter and Pat this
onto your lid don't brush it just put
take some more pup sure you keep looking
like this because if you look up right
now the crease line will make the will
make a line in your glitters of your
crease and may have this really nasty
crease line years later I did it with
this eye so I'm telling you right now
don't look up until it's fully dried
okay what I'm going to do right now is
I'm going to grab this matte black track
fluid line and I'm going to make a line
and it's just like any type of eyeliner
it's just with the wing you go all the
way out so I don't really think I need
to show you guys because it's just um
let me show you with the brush right
here you just make a line while the
lobola
and when you come here go out and then
from half of that point where you went
I'll go back in to make a thicker and
just play with it and then you have a
nice line mascara and black I go on my
waterline and then we will do the lips
so I'll be right back
okay from lips you can do two things
that's four um you can do um like that's
really really really dark burgundy um
almost black lips you can do that but I
think you can't
like a hooker will you do that and no
more bouche is about kind of sort of
hookers but still let's keep it classy I
started off with a lip erase then I
applied off a royalty by Mac this is a
baby pink color and then on top my new
lip gloss which is a Viva Glam Gaga
which is even prettier than the lipstick
and I want to recommend something that
if you do the dark lips please put this
lip gloss on top this is Maleficent it
is a wrong spell oh my god I can look at
her it's like a beauty on the Box inside
of in it well in it it's pretty too if
you are going to do dark lips please use
this one and then as a highlight on my
cubes though I use the highlight that I
used on my brown ones well so that
completes this entire Moulin Rouge look
I hope you guys liked it I hope you guys
learned something from it if you are
going to be a Muller Rouge girl for
Halloween please post some pictures like
sent them to me or make a video response
and yeah I hope you guys uh
