tutorial and at first look here will be
like let me explain
I wanted to do like a pirates Halloween
tutorial but I know a lot of people have
done it and will do it this Halloween
but I always want to be kind of
different than the rest of everybody and
then in this world of the Pirates
mermaids are the biggest fear they are
the devil creatures of the world
the mermaids and when you when when a
mermaid finds you that means you will
you don't want to live again someone I
came up with is that this ship full of
people like pirates they a group of
mermaids attack them and because the
mermaids wanted to imprint their sign on
to the Pirates you know like a scar or
something
instead of a scar they imprint and
they're like like they're like their
skin their glittery skin their mermaid
glittery goodness so instead of
attacking them and giving them a big
scar on the head they have to live with
like the glitter of the mermaid that
attacked them that is kind of my pirates
got attacked by a mermaid look today so
I hope you kind of know where I'm coming
from so let's stop blabbing and go to
the tutorial where the Pirates got a
score of a mermaid
so first thing you want to do is apply a
base to your lips to prevent your eyes
from creasing I use my Michael Todd knew
to cream eye shadow the first thing I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna define my nose
line and my crease I'm going to use
corduroy and we use that to contour the
cheekbones as well so first my nose line
I'm just gonna get a brush and just
intensify the nose line you have just a
tense fight and go under your brow this
will give you sort of a more masculine
look and then we're going to define the
crease as well I'm going to grab another
brush and just go into the crease and
connect it with that nose line so going
into the crease and then connected with
that point in the nose along your way
and then just blend it up and blend it
down then we're gonna highlight my brow
bone with my 275 by Sigma and my
favorite makeup studio I should ever
this is ivory gold this is my favorite
eye shadow ever it gives the most
amazing gold shine ever and you can get
it at the website down below and it's
right here as well it's actually my
mom's webshop so I definitely want you
guys to go and check it out and see what
my mom is offering you so now for the
lid I'm gonna grab next get erase Soller
bits this is pure love to my heart I'm
gonna grab a 239 and some of the sole
are bits which are amazing I am in love
with them and just put those on your
eyelid and you want to pet those on
because if you like brush them on your
entire cheek will be a scatter
that's pretty low really we're going to
make it really dirty and smoky I'm gonna
grab embark with my two fourteen hard so
I'm just dropping out of land and smoke
your bottom lash line at this 252 get
the tips of the bristles and going to
embark and smoker down even more then
I'm gonna grab corduroy again on that
brush for in the crease and go even Mara
down then I'm quickly gonna grab some
embark and carbon and line my upper lash
line
really really really softly kinda grab
mixing a medium eyeliner by Mac and just
get that on my finger and then just dab
it on the places where you want the
glitter to be then I'm gonna grab jewel
marine glitter which is the most amazing
glitter I have ever seen in my entire
life of living and then just with a
brush start applying it to your inner
corners and then follow that nose line
as well and then I want to make it
really messy so just take your finger go
into the glare and go on with your
fingers to give it that messy feeling
so now I'm going to go ahead and apply
some mascara and black eyeliner to my
waterline and then I will be back so of
course my name wouldn't be Nikki if I
wouldn't apply some new lip so um I'm
just gonna get peach stock by Mac and
then get some Gaga gloss and put that on
top so I hope you guys liked it and if
you try it out please let me know post
some pictures are supposed to video
response or something like that just try
to guys just have fun with the glitter
and just go for it so thank you guys so
much for watching and I will see you
