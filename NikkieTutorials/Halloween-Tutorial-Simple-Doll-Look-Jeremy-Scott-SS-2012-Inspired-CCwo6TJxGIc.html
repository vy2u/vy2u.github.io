Halloween look a simple dull-eyed look
with freckles and stuff but this is also
inspired by a Jeremy Scott runway show
for spring 2012 and we're all gonna die
I try to give it really simple so no
lashes just the hardest part is the
eyeliner and then the fake freckles and
the bright blush and the pink lips and I
absolutely love this look I might just
spray this on Halloween I know how weave
is all about being scary but I just
really like this so um if you want to
know how it did this look then please
keep on watching so as I say in every
video you have to start up a look with a
primer for your eyelids to prevent the
eyeshadow from creasing and the one that
I'm using is my trusty old Mac soft
ochre Paint Pot so the first thing I'm
going to do is I'm gonna take this paste
powder from it and this is a studio care
blend pressed powder and light you can
use any face powder that you like I'm
just going to use this because this is
my color but you want to take a color
close to your skin tone and just put
that on your lid to even everything out
now I'm going to take this Mac palette
and this is called perler smoke and I'm
gonna take the brown color right there
and that is called cross-cultural and
with cross-culture I'm just gonna cut
the crease but I'm gonna go a little bit
further up just like a bit on that side
then once you reach the outer corner you
don't want to go down and connect it to
the lower lip but you want to wing it
out so just make a wing make a wing and
then connect it to the other parts now
I'm going to take cross-cultural and
Cork and I'm going to blend that up a
bit
damn girl damn and that was already time
for the eyeliner I'm just gonna make a
small line under my eye so it's actually
under my eye and I'm gonna go a little
bit further and then wing it out and
then just do a normal cat eyeliner but
kind of extend it a little bit further
out as well and for that I'm not going
to use my Inglot eyeliner because that
is waterproof and if you ask this up you
will be screwed and you have to start
all over again I'm gonna take max blood
trick fluid line this is not what
approve so when you do make a mistake
you can just take a q-tip make it wet
and wipe it away I will give you a
little tip on how you can make a
eyeliner brush like this really steady
and pointy take the lid of the eyeliner
and you do this you swirl the brush
around so you kind of swirl it around
and that will make a really fine tip and
that will help making that line really
thin as well so I'm just gonna start up
with that line underneath
we're just going to go to the in a
corner and then with that small brush
again and then I go a little bit further
in
okay not to make the eyes really pop I'm
gonna highlight the inner corners of the
eye it's weird that I'm going to take
this mech pure white penguin I have a
sample of it and to make it a little bit
more light reflecting and shimmery I'm
going to take this Ben Nye Lumiere
pigment in ice and I'm going to put a
long this camera on my bottom lashes and
my top lashes you can add false lashes
to this I can fo foundation I'm
definitely going to use my favorite
which is the MEK face and body and with
my favorite foundation brush which is
the Real Techniques buffing brush I'm
just going to put that all over
now I'm going to set everything with the
powder because face somebody is really
really shiny and I don't want to look
like a greaseball so I'm gonna take this
Kryolan transparent powder and of course
if you powder it it will stay on the
entire day infomercials
ok then at the Jeremy Scott show the
models were wearing a really bright
blush and the closest one I have to it
is this makeup studio blush Lumiere in
soft peach I'm gonna put this on really
lightly but kind of strong as well
because I do want to replicate that look
that the models were wearing and also
the models had unfaith freckles I'm
gonna use 3 tones of frickle colors I'm
going to take this Ben Nye eyebrow
pencil in taupe that is my darkest
freckle color then I have my medium
freckle color which is Illamasqua
interrogate and then my light freckle
color is hex
you want to make sure that the point of
your eyeliner or that I let you're using
is sharp you don't want it to be as
sharp that you're making holes in your
face you will become a pizza
I'm gonna feel like poopy long cows okay
pepper lips and them up take off that
foundation that is on it okay and
therefore lipstick kind of have that
bright baby pink and for that I'm gonna
use Mac's st. Germain and I'm just gonna
dab it on so it's more like a stain and
not really a lipstick um so yeah I hope
you guys enjoyed for a full list of all
four house musgood some website
nikkietutorials DICOM also it's on my
nails and all that stuff and I think you
guys so much for watching I love you and
hopefully every see you guys next time
