doing a collab with Claire Lily's art
here on YouTube we're doing a zombie
Halloween collab and Hearst is sort of a
version of I hate school and against
it's everywhere and then I become a
zombie or something she has all these
sits on her face it's absolutely gross
you kind of want to see it as if I was a
showgirl who did her show tonight she
got bitten by a zombie and she's still
pissed off about it but um this is my
zombie look for my clip with me and
Claire Dilys
art and I just removed a thing if you
want to know how this is a zombie
Halloween look then please keep on
watching and definitely don't forget to
check out Claire version of this so yeah
okay so I'm gonna use some showgirl
colors to really get that showgirl look
and then make it dead the first color
notes use is this a sugar pill poison
plum eye shadow I'm going to put that in
my crease
okay that's for my lower lashline I'm
gonna take this ink la palette I have I
don't know the number of this one but I
will put it on my website but I'm gonna
take this blue e what is it my bluey
color and I'm gonna put that on my lower
lash line and then kind of go out and
make a point so kind of go out in this
stripy pointy thing and then kind of
make a triangle at your outer corners
I'm going to blend the purple ad with
poison plum again and go up into the
crease then I'm going to put that blue
in black color back into the crease
again and blend it now for Matt Lee I'm
gonna take that in o'clock color again
and I'm also going to take this Inglot
pigment in number 70
I wanna make a mixture between those two
and I'm gonna put that on my lid
now that I did for the Showgirl part
last is at some glitter on my list to
make it show really the glitter I'm
using is where are you is Amex jewel
marine it's really pretty
we're gonna do some steps towards the
zombie look already I'm gonna apply a
like reddish lip liner to my waterline
to make them look like really infected
and tired and zombie ish the colors are
gonna use for that is burgundy lip
pencil from Mac and also a little bit of
brick lip pencil by Mac so what the
Burgundy just put it on your inner
corners and go down a bit just brush it
in then with her finger blended in and
make it look sick okay so that is good
for now I'm just gonna apply some
mascara to my lashes because of course
as to showgirl part she was wearing some
mascara
so I'm gonna apply some mascara right
now and then it will be back for the
zombie skin the first thing I'm gonna do
is take this sea sponge and I'm gonna do
my foundation with the sea sponge first
because if you put a financial on just
put your hands or with the brush on the
application is way too smooth you will
look like a showgirl but you want to
look like a rotting zombie and for that
I'm going to use like a really textured
sponge that when you applying it the
texture of the sponge actually goes on
to your skin as well so you get not that
perfect application will kind of like
the chappy the illy applications I'm
gonna take LMS custom base and number
two which is a lighter know my skin tone
so I'm just gonna start patting that
onto my skin
and then with the clean part I'm gonna
blend it into my skin what I'm now gonna
do is take a great darker skin color so
I'm going to take a darker foundation
and mix it with black to make it gray
and I'm gonna put that on like the outer
corners of my face and some in the
middle and that will kind of make a
three-dimensional by giving a lighter
rotten structure and a darker rotten
structure okay stay the texture that I
just made there that is kind of what you
want like that rotting texture okay
after you've got the texture of that
skin down I'm going to do some heavy
contouring for that I'm going to use NYX
or uniques taupe blush and make it a
little bit more purple with next shadowy
lady which is a dark purple
okay now I'm gonna make the eyes look
really infected and red I'm gonna take a
max spiced chocolate I'm also going to
take this color from a mix parlor smoke
pellet I'm going to take cross-cultural
and I'm going to use tech colors to make
bags under my eyes
what I'm going to do is take my death
wheel and mix the green and the blue and
kind of make veins coming out of random
spots I'm going to do that and then with
the Bailey pink and the yellow we I'm
gonna blank out my lips to make him look
dead
okay the last thing I'm going to do is
add some blood coming out for my nose
and just splatter it on in random places
I'm gonna take my favorite made one
couette this is a killer to say
coagulated blood gel so like that and
then splatter it so yeah i think i
centered this up for a full list of off
