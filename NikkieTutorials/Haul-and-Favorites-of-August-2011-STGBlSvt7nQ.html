sort of favorites because everything
that I bought today is something that I
wanted to buy again for so long because
I was running out of it or some products
or even gone already
today way too okay yeah and I'm just
gonna show you everything that I got
today plus one eye shadow that I am
obsessed with okay so first of all I got
this blazer at Zara and it's just a
really basic black blazer it's kind of
long actually you know it's just from
their basics collection so I just got
that and I absolutely love it it's a
little bit too small because I'm white
as a bear but I'm trying to lose weight
anyway so this is kind of more like a
push to lose it even more so is this
blazer is from Zara pizza in New York I
brought my perfume alien from Thierry
Mugler moogle or however you want to
pronounce it and I love that scent the
thing is my friend who was in New York
as well loved it also so she put it on
too so it's been like two weeks it was
gone
so I got a new alien perfume and this
time I got the refillable one because I
know that alien is one of my favorite
scents perfumes and I know that once
this is done I want another one so I'm
just going to take the refillable one if
you don't know alien go to your mall to
your city to your shopping state this
thing and go try alien is such a unique
scent like you either love it or you
either hate it okay so then I also went
to a Chanel concert and the new fall
collection was out with peridot peridot
kennedy gone I absolutely love panadol
in the bottle but once you swatch it it
was just really golden green and that's
not really what I like so I skipped that
one but I think I got feet and good on
feet is a third car or something from
that collection and it's really really
pretty guys it's an absolutely amazing
color it's like a pewter e silver color
with
old shine shimmer glitters in it then I
also got a matte lip liner this is oak
and oh this just for those games where I
want fuller lips yes even I sometimes on
fuller lips and this is just a perfect
color for outlining your lips without
looking like a porn star in the baby
okay then I also went to Sephora duh
I've got this Makeup Forever aqua lip in
number 18 see and it's a perfect coral
color I got this because of the picture
was sisters who else this is the perfect
coral color like here's this watch can
you see how beautiful that is
then I also got a aqua cream and this is
number 15 and number 15 is if I am right
taupe like I'm getting in the screen now
and these are even more waterproof it's
like you can it's like you can go
swimming with these on so if you ever
have like a swimming party you don't
want a completely bald I just put this
on as a base and you'll have nice Toby
shimmery eyes this is taupe just like an
icy taupe like it's just hope it's
beautiful
another aqua cream in number two which
is number which is the name seal and if
you can tell them it is just a beautiful
color and that is steel love it like I'm
wearing it as a base underneath all of
this right now so that is basically what
I thought today but I also have oh wait
let's zoom out because it's so fun
looking at my mouth the entire time okay
so I'm also gonna throw in some
favorites in this video one favorite of
mine is this makeup studio I shadow in
super frost bright bronze it's a
absolutely gorgeous shining Tobi bronze
color
I made a blog post about this on my
website because turns.com I will put the
link below but look if you put this one
onto the steel the aqua cream it will
make a to die for , Oh

workshop has girls make guys dot NL I'm
gonna also love the sweet pout know the
sleek the paint the new paint that just
came out these aren't like all the sleek
new paints stuff and spray lips are
