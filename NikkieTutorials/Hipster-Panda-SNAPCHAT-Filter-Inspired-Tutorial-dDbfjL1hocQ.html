installment of my snapchat makeup
tutorial series and I wanted to do
something unexpected and I went for the
hipster panda I cannot even explain to
you how much fun I have with this one
right here this is perfect for Halloween
a snapchat themed party for days when
you ruin your eyeliner for grocery
shopping prom all occasions I had an
absolute blast with this one so if you
would like to know how to look like the
hipster panda from snapchat then please
keep watching alright so the first thing
I'll be doing is applying foundation and
what we're going to do is kind of treat
our face like a delicate little flower
so when you think of flowers there is
always one color in the middle and then
it gradually fades out into another
color so with this Panda look this out
of nowhere this suddenly became so deep
so with this Panda look you want the
center of your face to be super light
almost white and then the outside to
gradually become darker now I can get
away with putting white on the center of
my face but if you're a person of color
or you have a tan just make sure that
you use a lighter color on the center of
your face I'm going to be using my new
Charlotte Tilbury magic foundations
today these are in the color 3 and
number tubes I'm going to make a mixture
of this and apply this onto my face and
then go in with a white stick paint
stick by Mac to make it even lighter so
first going in with the Charlotte
Tilbury Foundation and just patting it
on using my Beauty Blender and just look
at the beautiful beautiful finish this
foundation goes
and don't worry too much about covering
your dark circles because those dark
circles will become bigger dark circles
literally all right and now it's time to
set this all using a powder and I'm
using my morphe m4 4 for brush for this
to really get that powder in there and
to make it last all day long
all right to further intensify the
whiteness of the center of her face I'm
going to grab a light white eyeshadow
cuz I'm damn near wiped myself so I'm
going to go in with a white shadow and
brighten the center of my face even more
and the brush I'm using is the new
favorite this is by luck see it's the
680 brush
all right now it's time for the fun part
the black eyes and literally it's just
creating two large black circles around
your eyes it's like eyeliner gone wrong
but because I felt like I couldn't get
away with that because nobody wants to
see a tutorial where I put a white on
the center of my face black dots around
my eyes and called it a day so I'm gonna
make it a little bit more glam as always
so I'm gonna be adding glitter so this
is the shape we're gonna work with so
it's not a circle it's like a lengthened
circle it covers the brow goes kind of
straight down here got it all right so
I'm going to go in with the Mac this is
a prolong wear waterproof color stick
and cinder black and I'm just going to
map out the shape with this so we're
going to start off by logging off the
lid
all the way to the brow
come down here right at the side of the
nose
all right so we got that shape going on
at the top now you want to bring it down
like towards the middle of the tip of
your nose so when you go to the end of
your nose like the middle right there
and now you want to connect it all
so what I'm going to do now is fill this
all in using that same pencil
every makeup lover on this Saturday
night oh my god I'm so in the mood for
eyeliner not anymore
okay so we got this mapped out I swear
it's going to be better than this now
we're going to match up the other eye
you
we're now going to set this using a
black matte eyeshadow I'll be using my
new favorite color rain black moon and
I'm going to be using the Smith 1/2 to
brush for this and we're just going to
set it that's all we're going to do
we're just going to set it and forget it
so you might ask me Nicki where the
are we gonna wear this look easy
Halloween snapchat themed parties days
where you cannot get your eyeliner even
and days when you just want to show
everyone doing grocery shopping you're
the Panda buff I also highly recommend
this look going on a first date prom oh
my god best prom makeup ever what else
superhero you can be super Panda
honestly I'm telling you the
possibilities of wearing this makeup
look are endless
alright now it's the time where we add
in some definition and glam I'm going to
go into the cavity eye shadow Quan I'm
going to take the gray color in the
center right here called contour and
with a blending brush I'm just going to
add the the gray towards the outer
portions of our new eyes to add a little
bit more depth and life not just like a
black hole so see by me adding this gray
in there it pops a little bit more
instead of a superhero mask I'm gonna go
in with this black shimmer by Mac this
is called let's boogie
dazzle shadow and I'm just gonna pop
this over the lid to add some sparkle
all right now going in with the Urban
Decay heavy metal cooled air liner and
glam rock and just just adding a couple
more sparkles sporadically
I'm not going to put some black in my
waterline to get rid of those gaps
all right so you probably won't even
notice them but just to feel extra glam
we're going to go in with some lashes
the first lashes are going to go in with
our by Lily lashes these stunners right
here are called caviar and I'm going to
cut some 301's in half and use the inner
half as my outer corner like I do in
every snap tutorial
all right lashes are on you can probably
even see him but I feel them and that's
what matters so now we're going to work
on the nose and it's basically the same
as the lion tutorial we did you just
want to cover your nose like this theme
stripe again and top with black and the
day and for this I'm going to use my
jeffree star velour liquid lipstick in
weirdo
alright now we create the line in the
center going down to the lip and then we
covered the top lip only as well
all right so I think we're there the
only thing I'm gonna add of course or
glow I can be a panda all I want but I
still want glowing cheekbones taking a
morphe and 5/10 brush and my sleek
solstice highlighting pillow I'm going
to take the lightest color right here so
ride around your new eyes shape give
yourself a lovely fierce glow
all right as for the ears what i did was
i screenshotted the ears of the filter
printed them out and cut them so here I
have the ears of the filter and I left a
little space to bend the paper so I'm
going to bend the paper
put a bobby pin and put it right on my
head put it on your head like this
alright those are on and then for the
flowers the hipster flowers I found this
headpiece on ASOS and I ordered it and
didn't really know what to do with it
and then I saw the Panda filter and I
was like no so this is perfect and we're
just gonna put it right over top of the
forehead and there we are there we have
our hipster Panda snapchat filter I'm
living right now and that people
