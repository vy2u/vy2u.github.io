fun and personal video ever since I did
my first glow around the world video
where I just sat down did my makeup and
really talked to you to update you all
my life so many of you loved it you guys
were so appreciative that I actually
opened up a little bit and talked about
my life a little bit more and first of
all I want to thank you for giving me
that trust and for making me feel
comfortable enough with you to actually
open up about all this personal stuff so
today I just want to sit down and do it
again it's not a glow around the world
because I am still at home my plan was
to film this in New York City next week
but I'll be traveling alone so I'm
filming one at home so go around the
world home edition hello welcome to
Holland first and foremost before I
start I want to wish all my Floridians
all my Florida followers the best of
luck a situation you guys are in is
incredibly devastating and so scary I've
been watching the news all day I've been
watching live streams all day the the
size of the storm the size of this
hurricane is incredible and to everyone
out there please be safe and my thoughts
and prayers are with you and your family
my Ofra family is also located in
Florida so it's it's I'm so nervous all
this time to get like a message of the
over team saying look we've been hit or
something bad happened so I'm right
there with you in my mind and I am
praying and please be safe and if you
hear me Allah barking in the background
every time it's time for food she goes
nuts like mom so today I'm just sitting
down do my makeup talking to you guys
and I want to try to recreate the look I
was wearing in the world's most full
coverage foundation tutorial sash video
on the derma Col foundation because as
soon as I came back out with like the
full look done people were like oh my
god show us how so um yeah grab some
food grab some coffee grab some tag reps
and snacks and sit down or grab your
brushes and do your makeup with me so
before I actually start doing my makeup
I have something really really exciting
to announce
at 4 o'clock Eastern Standard Time which
is 1 p.m. Pacific Standard Time my new
Africa lection of the glow baby glow
collection lodges here we go ever since
we launched ever glow everyone's been
like oh my god I love it so much and I
wish I could get one of the shades
individual and a full-size pan that is
exactly what is happening right now plus
they are in a new and improved more
sleek packaging so right here is the
lightest shade I've ever glow and my
favorite part about collaborating with
brands and like creating products is
coming up with names so I came up with
the for the lightest shade I came up
with the name glazed donut it has a tiny
little hole right there and when you
push it the highlighter pen comes out
and these are magnetic so you can pop
these into a little pallets to bring it
with you for traveling so I love this I
love this so much the medium shade is
called glow goals this is so beautiful
on a little bit of a deeper skin tone
and the darkest shade is called blind
the haters and we did tweak the shade a
little bit more to be a little bit more
golden instead of copper and I think
it's gonna match deeper skin tones even
nicer so those three highlights are
gonna be available at 4/1 so any minute
now plus I pulled some strings for you
usually they retail for $35 from now to
the 17th the highlighters are $29 plus
if you use a discount code at checkout
it can be mine it can be one of your
favorite influencers it can be Oprah's
it brings it to 20 dollars 30 but my
favorite part about this collection this
liquid lipstick right here this one is
called Dutchess this is more of a cool
toned mob berry color it is perfect for
fall
it is stunning on pretty much every skin
tone out there it looks warmer and
darker on me because of my skin tone my
color but on others it's gonna lean more
cool toned more warm toned it looks
different on everybody and that I love
that I love shapeshifter this is amazing
and that just I'm so proud and this cost
$20 but if you use any discount code it
brings it to $14 all right enough
laughing I'm sorry when I am really
proud of something I just keep on going
and going everyone it's time for the
makeup I'm gonna be trying out a brand
new primer for me this is Becca velvet
blurring primer perfecting base it is
very liquidy oh it's super liquidy on
the hands but as soon as it hits the
face and you start working it in it
becomes like a powdery velvet finish for
foundation I'm gonna be using the
Lancome teint Idole ultra wear and some
Studio Fix fluid by Mac this weekend has
been one of the most eventful and weird
weekend's of my life yesterday was a
really emotional day because we finally
set our final goodbyes to my grandpa to
OPA he passed away a couple of months
ago and yesterday we spread his ashes at
his favorite lake this is a lake that my
grandpa and grandma used to go to all
the time with their dogs and he told my
grandma like honey if the day ever comes
and like you you have to do what you got
to do this is the place you should do it
so we went to that Lake so they cremated
my grandpa they cremated OPA and it's so
weird but when we you know let go of his
ashes spread his ashes you're letting go
of like this little cocoon of a powder
of dust that really freaked me out a
little cause like that to me I said my
goodbyes to Grandpa when he passed away
so yesterday for me I know it
symbolically like it's it's part of
letting go but to me yesterday wasn't
saying goodbye to Grandpa it was just
really odd it was weird to me it was
just I felt a little weird I felt a
little odd that there was this like
cocoon of ashes and to just spread it
into his favorite lake in that being it
I think when somebody passes away
there's so much more to it than just you
know letting go of ashes so I still
don't quite know how I
about yesterday it's it weirded me out a
little I'm gonna be totally real a lot
of people have been asking me for
updates on my little brother um so uh
here we go like I said they found a new
cancer in his leg it's a tumor basically
the type of cancer my little brother has
is a cancer that doesn't happen a lot
what we found out was I don't know the
word in English but you can get chemo
and you can get like radiation I think
that's what you call it so the previous
time they did radiation on him they
pretty much tackled his entire body like
pretty much everything except for one
little spot and guess where the cancer
came back that one little spot so that
pissed me the fuck off now of course
nobody wished for it to come back but
they missed a little spot with radiation
so it came back all right let me set
these under eyes real quick before I
couldn't hurt pretty much the first
round they did all you know classic
treatments to fight cancer now that it's
back he's becoming sort of like a little
lab rat and they want to try all the new
you know they want to try all the new
stuff out on him which scares me because
I'm like well the first one worked if
you didn't miss that little spot but now
they want to change it up a little bit
and try new techniques and methods on
him which if it works it's fine with me
but like it's it's scary this new
technique is when you do radiation on
someone with cancer they try to focus on
one portion of the body and really
destroy all the bad stuff there but
sometimes like we've noticed you miss a
couple of thoughts with this new
technique they make tiny little punchers
into his leg where the tumor is and they
put little cannula slash tubes in his
leg they get it right up to the tumor
and then they can do radiation from
within
so usually radiation is pointing at the
body and trying to get everything with
this new technique they put the
radiation inside his body to get it more
localized and really focused on one
point of the body with this one the
tumor gosh I've really open making some
sort of
but usually radiation comes from outside
of the body now they're gonna put like
tiny little cannulas slash tubes inside
his leg near the tumor to radiate it
from within the body now if this is
successful let's let's hope and pray
that this is successful he needs usually
he needed eight chemos it brings it down
to only two and chemo is amazing to
fight cancer but it is disastrous and
destroying the body because chemo kind
of flushes everything out the good stuff
and the bad stuff just everything and
part of the reason why this weekend is
so it's like a roller coaster for me is
because tonight his procedure starts
tonight they're gonna take him into the
hospital and then tomorrow morning is
the procedure and what pissed me off at
first was that they said with this
procedure he had to be in quarantine for
a week but they quickly told us
yesterday that that isn't necessary
during the procedure when they're doing
the radiation from inside of his body
that's when everything will be closed
down on the wall will like protect us
all but as soon as the radiation is done
we can see him we can touch him we can
love him we can do whatever we want and
that really cleared up my mind a little
bit because I was so mad I was like how
are you gonna put a tiny young little
boy in quarantine for a week so on
Tuesday is gonna be the first time I see
him since the procedure and all your
comments giving me love and support to
my family and my little brother and me
meant so much to me so thank you for
keeping him in your prayers and thank
you for thinking of us and it's it's
really really appreciated all right so I
quickly did my brows off-camera my brows
naturally are super uneven so for me to
get them a little bit even I have to
really hunch down look at the brows look
at what I need to do and doing that on
camera it's not a pretty sight so
quickly did my brows my face is set and
that would seem to play with the eyes so
in the video for eyes I actually use
this palm right here this is the carrot
II Just Peachy palette and I am loving
this right now look at this for that
look I did something really quick and
easy so I'm grabbing a little bit
this shade right here called Atlanta and
that is going on the outer portion of my
eyes and not going in at all I just want
it to be a little bit defined and smoky
on the outer corners oh I am joining a
Dutch game show called the big escape if
you're following me on snapchat you're
so sick and tired of me talking about
this damn show it airs in Holland every
Wednesday at a twenty five twenty
twenty-five on NPO three this show is
basically escape rooms on crack they had
a deserted Airport where we had to
escape certain rooms they had second
world war bunkers what we had to get out
of it is such a crazy crazy intense show
and it's twelve contestants
I've been asked for more Dutch game
shows but usually they're like survivor
which do you see me on an island not
eating I never really fell in love with
any of the formats they presented me I
just thought that it was gonna be a
little bit of a wreck to see me in a
show like that but with the big escape
it's such an amazing cast
I love escape rooms and before they
asked me to do to show I did one I loved
it so much so I was like yeah let me do
it production told me that my storyline
is beautiful
they told me that they see me starting
off really small and sort of like how I
was younger in groups like I I was more
to myself and a little bit more toned
down and almost a little bit insecure
and then they tell me that throughout
the show you see me grow and become more
confident in the games and with the
people and really truly become a true
self I can't tell you too much but like
it's been really fun to see myself grow
like that I learned so much about myself
on that show about my character about my
persona about how I handle things and I
really grew and I really started to
believe in myself again because of this
show I noticed that after shooting the
show I I feel like a brand new person
almost so I highly suggest that if
you're Holland and you can watch the
show then please do if you're from
America I ask them they don't have the
rights to put it online for everyone to
see
um so let me talk to them like I'm like
can you sell your forma to America and
make me like contestant number one of
season number one in America now I'm
gonna go into the color Glo up and that
is going over my entire lid meeting up
into the brown so for anyone expecting a
really intricate and original artistic
look today is not gonna be the day it's
a really quick and simple glam natural
look with like two colors on the eye
I've been watching a lot of fear The
Walking Dead lately I watched the first
season a couple of months ago and I
really liked it and then I had to wait
for season two and I kind of forgot
about it now I'm starting to roll back
into it and I've been so obsessed I know
I am and season 2 episode 9 and honestly
I love Nick speaking of shows Game of
Thrones I am that type of person where I
go online on forums like I look at all
the spoilers like if anything if anyone
spoils something for me I'm not mad at
them because like I probably will find
out myself I like reading all up on it
on forums and like online I am that one
person that I cannot sit down until I
know exactly what's gonna happen like I
don't like surprises I like being
prepared and everything when I watch a
show as I'm watching the episode I'll
scroll my phone and look for like what's
gonna happen next because I love being
prepared or something like that it's
such an easy I look I'm so sorry meme
boring today cue the ugly face in three
two one
okay highlighting my inner corners like
a mad person cuz the inner corner has
been doing it for me lately alright so
that is all you have to do for shadow
for this look I'm not gonna pop on some
lashes off-camera cuz again every we
have to look hunched down and really
good in there so let me go ahead and do
that and I'll be right back so we can
play with my new highlighters already
eyes are done so before we get to the
fun part which is highlighting my face
with my glow baby glow collection and
highing duchess lipstick i first have to
do a little bit of bronzing this brush I
saw Tati upsets over this brush I'm not
sure if I like it more than my benefit
hoola brush just yet because I feel like
you have a little bit more precision and
control with the hoola one but this is a
good brush for sure it really
distributes it in such a beautiful blown
out way so good brush
