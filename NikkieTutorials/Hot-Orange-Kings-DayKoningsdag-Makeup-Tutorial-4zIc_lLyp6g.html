to my kingsday tutorial this is a
tutorial
especially for my duchies for King's day
or if you're a sucker for orange that is
of course so last year we got a new king
and I definitely felt a little bit like
Game of Thrones I'm really thankful that
we do not have a Joffrey so far King's
say for his birthday all the people go
on to the streets here in Holland and
have parties and just celebrate his
birthday by wearing a red white or blue
the colors of our flag or orange I
thought it would be fun to share my
King's day's makeup look with you I did
two before for Queen's Day so if you
want to check those out you can find
them in the info box down below if you
want to know how to get this King's day
makeup tutorial orange makeup tutorial
and please keep on watching so I already
went ahead and applied my base and for
that I use my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot
and the first I should will be using is
by makeup studio and this is an eye
shadow refill in number 14 I'm going to
start off by placing that in my crease
first I'm going to work my way in all
the way to the inner corner of the
crease now with the big blending brush
and a little bit of that same color are
really going to diffuse the edges and
blend this up to my brow bone and this
beautiful yellow color will act as a
transition color for the orange to blend
a little bit nicer for the orange I will
be using my favorite orange eyeshadow
and this is by sugarpill called flame
point and with that I'm going to
concentrate that right up in my crease
as well and staying mainly on the outer
half right here so really build that
orange in there and I just love this
color combo I'm also going to apply
flame points on the outer half of my
lower lash line and then taking makeup
studio number 14 again
and that is going on the other half and
where they meet I'm just going to blend
it nicely together and then with that
crease brush that I used before I'm just
going to take flame point and connect
the bottom lash line to my crease right
here at the corners for the lid I'll be
taking this sugar pill supercharged
sparkling the young pigment and I
absolutely love this color but since I
just a little bit of a harder pigment to
work with I'm going to make it wet and
for that I'll be using my illamasqua
sealing gel so I'm just going to take
that color and dab it on to the lid and
then let it meet right up here in the
crease where that orange is as my
eyeliner i will use this Stila stay all
day waterproof liner in amber and I
think this will tie in perfectly with
all the orange shades just go ahead and
apply that as your liner and I'm going
quite sick with this because I really
like how does a deep amber color sort of
grounds the look a little bit more and
I'm not going to go for a wing or
anything I just want this to act to
ground the lashes and the entire look a
little bit more so once you reach that
outer corner sort of whispered into the
orange now quickly highlight your inner
corners using your favorite highlighter
shade and mine is from the lorac
unzipped palette and it's called under
cover and now it's time for mascara
eyelashes so for mascara I will be using
my makeup studio waterproof 3d in exer
plaque and on top of that a little bit
of Mac's
extended play gigablack lash and for
lashes I'll be using my favourites which
are the Mac 36 so for the cheeks I
already contoured to using my illamasqua
eyeshadow in heroine I also kinda
already did a little bit of bronzing I'm
sorry I did use my Illamasqua dissipate
blush for that and I heard they're
discontinuing it so I'm just adding a
little bit more of that but if that is
true if they are discontinuing disobey
that is the biggest mistake that we will
ever make illamasqua if you're seeing
this don't you dick
I just I want all of you who are
watching this and who like disobey I
want you guys to tweet Illamasqua um
safe disobey for Nicki and us something
along those lines just tag me in
Illamasqua in it
let's save disobey for a bless you're
gonna make a nice mixture between Mex as
a Lea blossom blush ombre and keycodes
rock attraction blush in number four pop
apricot and then apply that to the
apples of your cheeks and of course I
need a little bit of glow in this look
and for that I'm using my key car wreck
attraction blush in number one pearly
rock that is going right here and then
also of course the other highest points
of my face your face if you're doing
this on yourself I'm gonna start off by
giving my lips a little bit more
fullness and plump using my
stripped-down lip pencil by Mac and I'm
going to take a little bit of illamasqua
scream pigment in emerg and I'm just
going to take the tiniest bit and tap
that on top I really want to keep the
lips natural with a dash of orange
because the eyes are so extremely orange
already I don't want the rest of the
look to be super orange as well so I'm
going to keep the lips really natural
because I'm just playing a bit I'm gonna
take the revlon colorburst matte balm in
mischievous and I'm just going to put a
little bit of that on top for a little
bit more orange Coralie vibe and then as
a gloss I'm going to take this Kiko
vinyl lips lip gloss in number one
and that guy's concludes my orange canes
