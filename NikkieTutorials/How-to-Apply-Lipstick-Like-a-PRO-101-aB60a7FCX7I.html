tutorial sort of like a 101 on how to
apply lipstick like a pro lately I've
been getting so many questions on how I
do my lips how I apply lipstick on my
models how I apply lipstick on my
clients it's just looks like lipstick
lipstick how do you apply it so for
today I thought it would be fun to show
you different techniques on how to apply
lipstick like a pro so in this video I
will show you how you can get a really
crisp and clean sort of symmetrical
editorial lip then I'm going to show you
how to easily transform it into a high
gloss lip which is also perfect for
photoshoots after that I will show you
technique I always add color to lips and
sort of like a feeling and the last
technique I will show you is inspired by
the Asian sort of ombre style lip look
it's sort of like really making your
lips look smaller and more gradient and
bright colored it's a really cool
technique that I've been seeing a lot
lately so if you want to know how to
apply lipstick like a pro as if you're
on a professional photo shoot and please
keep on watching the first look I will
show you is how to get the perfect clean
crisp symmetrical editorial lip and for
this I'll be using a hot pink color and
this is number 52 by Barry M what I tend
to do all the time is to make my color
stand out better so this is a really
bright pink I'm you dab my entire lips
because the lighter the basis the more
the color on top is going to pop right
in so we'll just use my concealer from
OCC this will give you a blank canvas to
work with
okay what I do now is I take my favorite
lip brush and my favorite lip brush is
by Mac and this is D 231 is a really
squared off lip brush and I love this I
use it on all my models I use it on
myself it's just the square shape to it
makes life so much easier and basically
what I do is elope the lipstick on both
sides of the brush and what you always
want to do is make sure that the point
of the lipstick brush is sharp so you
always want to flatten it down to make
it sharp again what I always do is I
start off with my Q
spell
you want both sides to be as high as the
other so if this goes a little bit
higher up that one goes higher up as
well a question I get all the time is
why do you do that creepy smile I will
explain to you when you apply lipstick
like this you have wrinkles in your lips
why I do the creepy smile is because it
tugs all the wrinkles away and it just
makes your lips one smooth canvas to
sort of glide the product on okay what I
do now is take more of that lipstick and
what I do is I took this part up or I
lift it up and then place my brush in
the very outside corner of my lip and
then go up
and now what you want to do is connect
the sides to the top
so once everything is symmetrical I just
kind of take the lipstick from the
bullet and fill in what's missing and
again I do that creepy smile so it makes
life easier so right now you have a
really clean crisp perfect sort of top
lip we want to connect the bottom to it
and to do that I load up my lip brush
with some product again and then all you
want to do is and this is kind of tricky
because you want the corners right there
to connect to the bottom you don't want
like a top lip and a half lip you want
it to be one and I sort of do a weird
sort of uh folks I don't know what's
happening and then you sort of go in
that corner and drag it down
once I have that outline I again take my
lipstick and fill in where it's needed
this is looking pretty good huh not good
enough what I always do on my model for
my clients on myself once I have two lip
on I track it with some concealer that
is my magic trick to get a lip to look
clean and crisp and perfect you need
concealer I take a really small brush by
design Pro and this is the number 13 and
what I do is I mix my concealer I take
my OCC skin conceal in y1 and then I mix
it with a fluid and what I normally take
for this is my Mac face and body
foundation this is c1 and I kind of mix
it two together to get the sort of
really harsh pigmentation of the occ one
but the fluid II and the sort of flow of
the face and body and you just want to
make sure that the concealer brush is
nice and flat and sharp and then I do my
creepy smile again and then I just
outline my lip where I feel like it
needs to be more sharp and perfect so
right here I went too far down I'm not
going to push that up with my concealer
and the last thing you want to do is
suck your thumb and get rid of the
lipstick on the inner rim so it doesn't
get on your teeth and then is how you
get the perfect symmetrical clean lip I
tend to work with matte lipsticks only
just because I always have the option to
go for a met to our high gloss or just a
little bit of gloss as a starting makeup
artists it can be really expensive to
buy as so many lipsticks in so many
colors and then get exact color matching
lip glosses it just gets too pricey so
of course if you have a bright bright
lipstick like this and you really want
to sort of kick it up a notch you can
always take a matching lip gloss this is
Illamasqua 's sheer lip gloss in divine
and it's just the perfect match but if
you want to do with the cheap way where
you can just use one product to make all
your sort of matte lipsticks into a high
shine gloss
I recommend the always and ever best
product ever on the market Elizabeth
Arden eight hour cream you can use this
as a lip treatment you can use this for
dry patches on your face on your body
this is just if you have something dry
on your body this will solve it all you
want to do is take a bit of the
Elizabeth Arden eight hour cream don't
be shy if you want a high high gloss you
have to pack that Soph on put the cream
on your index finger and then let your
index finger rest on one part of your
Cupid's bow and then take off look at
the half it's so luscious and glossy and
full and it's just the perfect technique
so take more of the Elizabeth Arden
eight hour cream put it on the lip let
it dress take it off
and just like that you transformed a mat
live to a high shine glossy lip this is
a technique which I use when I want to
give my model sort of a ceiling of
lipstick and color but without going
really clean and crisp like we did in
the first step and I intend to use this
technique when I have a really soft raw
edgy feeling in my look but I don't want
that symmetrical lip that makes it
glamor all of a sudden so this technique
is used when you just want some color
and sort of a feeling of lipstick colors
I tend to grab for when using this
technique are by Max Factor and this is
a soft pink creamy blush so this is a
blush actually but I use it on my models
lips and another color I love for this
technique is my Mac and this is their
cream color base in virgin isle and it's
just a stunning bright coral color and
I'll you literally want to do is it's so
easy you take your middle finger and you
go in the product just open your mouth
and first Pat the inside now smack your
lips together take a little bit more and
keep adding
I absolutely love this technique to keep
everything raw not too precise not too
perfect and just give the face some
color and sort of a feeling like a good
lip the last technique is a technique
that you see a lot on Asian people what
these stunning boys and girls do is sort
of mute out the entire lip color and
then put a really bright pop of color on
the inner rim and they kind of blend it
in such a way that the lips appears a
little bit smaller making the eyes look
bigger and sort of giving that entire
dull look another dimension so the first
thing you want to do is completely blank
out your lips and for that I will be
using my OCC concealer take your bright
colored lipstick and I chose for this
really bright rosy pink color and for
those of you who want to know this is
Maybelline's color sensational in vivid
rose now with a brush what you want to
do is color the inside rim of your lips
really closely and not too big
now slightly smack your lips together
and add a little bit more and if you
feel like you can't get the blending
right just take that concealer brush
again and sort of dust away the edges of
the pink to give it a gradient effect
all I want to do now is apply some gloss
and for that I will be using my
Elizabeth Arden 8 hour cream again and
just apply that 8 hour cream the same
way we applied from going Matt to gloss
I absolutely love this technique it's so
cute it's so subtle yet bright and I
love this technique and that guys are
four techniques that I love to use when
applying lipstick on my models my
clients and I myself and it's just these
are the four techniques that I tend to
gravitate towards the most when working
on a photo shoot or a wedding day or
whatever it's just basically how I do
