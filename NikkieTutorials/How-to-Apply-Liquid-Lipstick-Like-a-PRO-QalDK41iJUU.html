comments saying that people love liquid
lipsticks they just don't know how to
work with them do you need a lip pencil
were precious unicorns harmed in the
process of making them just so many
questions on how to work with liquid
lipsticks so I thought for today why not
show you how I like to apply a liquid
lipstick like a pro it's super easy so
yeah if you would like to know how to
apply a liquid lipstick then keep on
watching alright so the first thing I
always do when applying liquid lipstick
is making sure that the canvas I'm
working on is totally blank basically
what I'm saying is that I like applying
a little bit of foundation or concealer
over top of my lips to make the color
that I put it on top pop so what I
usually do is just take my foundation
brush that still has foundation in it
from my face there's a girl remote my
favorite liquid lipsticks are by the
brands honest on superflous hills Kat
Von D color grain there are many thick
ellipse ticks on the market nowadays but
for today I'm gonna use this color right
here this is by Anasazi beverly hills
and this is called karina lots of people
always ask me how do you actually get
the product on the brush is really easy
a lot of artists will tell you to just
pop the color onto the back of your hand
and call it a day just pick it up from
your hand put it on a pallet but I find
to get the most fresh product and fresh
liquid lipstick straight from the brush
onto your lips you just take out the
liquid lipstick wand you take your lip
brush today I'll be using the Mac 231 my
favorite and what I do just straight
from the wand I pick it up on my brush I
like to start with my top lip and
especially the Cupid's bow so I just
give myself a little smile and I draw in
the Cupid's bow
a little trick is to create a cross on
the Cupid's bow to make sure that both
sides are even once that is done I pick
up more on my brush straight from the
wand and I make this really weird face
where I just pop my top lip out like
this and I place my brush directly into
the corner of my mouth and I flick it up
to the top of my lip
and now you can really easily connect
this top line to the corner of your
mouth so just from the top of that lip
connected to that corner once you have
the top lip outlined just fill in with
the wand once we've got the top lip done
of course you want to focus on the
bottom lip what I like to do first is
get the wand just a liquid lipstick wand
and go straight onto my lip and just
fill in the center this way I have a
guideline for my corners to go to the
center of my lip now I picked some more
product up on my brush again I open my
mouth slightly and place a brush on the
corners from there drag it on to the
center of the lip this way all you're
left to do is just thicken it up a
little bit here so it's more symmetrical
but you don't have to worry about
perfecting the corners so as you can see
I now have the perfect outer corner of
my lip I just have to lower it down a
little bit here to make it symmetrical
to get the true color of the liquid
lipstick straight onto my lips and now
dip the wand back into the liquid
lipstick one more time and this I wipe
all over my lips just to get the true
color
and this will dry Matt now for some
reason you're not content with your
outline and you want to clean it up a
little bit
I took some concealer this is by
unassessably Hills as well and was a
little concealer brush I just like to
neaten up and sharpen up the lines on
the outside a little bit more and that's
it and that guys is how you can apply
liquid lipstick like a pro with the
brush no lip liner just the liquid
lipstick only and I would like to
welcome you now to the wonderful world
of liquid lipsticks only so thank you
