on how I contour and blush and highlight
my face on a daily basis this is my
contour and highlight and blush routine
I like to do this all with powders so I
will do a video on how you can contour
with creams later on not today I've been
getting a lot of requests to do my
contour and highlighting and blushing
routine for years and years now and I
thought that today would be the perfect
day to show you how I tackle this space
yeah there really isn't much to it so
without any further ado I'm going to
show you how you can sculpt and
highlight this face your face not mine
yours okay enjoy so my favorite product
to contour with on my sour skin tone by
far is heroine I shadow by Illamasqua
this is my Holy Grail it doesn't matter
which powder I gravitate towards I
always go back to this one right here
because this has the perfect amount of
cool toned / warm tone it has a perfect
mix of warm and cool toned it looks like
a shadow on the skin which makes it
perfect for contouring it's just a
perfect shade for light skin tones like
me my favorite brush to contour with is
by far the Mac 163 this brush is my
ride-or-die I have tried a gazillion
trillion billion brushes to contour with
narced EDA this other brush and that
other brush they all just fade away in
comparison to this one right here this
just has the perfect shape density size
it just it's perfect for contouring
alright so let's get started I'm taking
the powder on my brush and I just tap it
in like this until I feel like I have
enough on the brush almost everyone on
planet earth you have this like little
curve here it follows the temples and
then it curves and it goes behind the
ear what I usually do is from that curve
there is my starting point and usually
what I do is just follow the curve of my
cheek so with my cheek if I go really
plastic with you now you can see that my
cheek goes like
this that is exactly what you want to
enhance and contour so starting at that
little curve I make soft motions and I
follow my cheek so what I usually do
then is grab more powder and I'm going
to start intensifying it so just with
soft circular motions like this you
start diffused and blend that out round
it out right to that side of that nose
and follow the curve so far we have
totally enhanced our cheek you can see
that this is a lot more prominence and
curve and this is just like whatever you
always want the strongest part of your
contour to be right at that curve you
never want the deepest darkest part to
be right here because then it will look
like a smudge it will look like a smear
it will look like mud if you keep the
darkness right to the sides of your face
it's perfect grab a little bit more and
go at the sides just basically directly
onto my temple and follow my hairline
and if you have a big forehead like I do
this will do magic on camera so right
now we've got a really nice soft contour
going on as you can see just compared
bull so what I usually do then is go to
a new brush which is the makeup studio
sl1 it's a really big fluffy blending
bronzing brush I want to do with this is
diffuse and blend out the contour and
also give my skin warmth
so it's bronzer time my two favorite
bronzers for this are the Too Faced milk
chocolate Soleil light medium matte
bronzer I like this because it's great
for fair skin tones like my skin but it
still gives it warmth and still makes
you look healthy and glowy now I might
be fair but I like my bronzy days also
so then I go to
the refined golden bronzing powder by
Mack and this is for when I want to look
extra warm and extra bronzed up and just
get the beachy feel so today I'm going
to go for the Mac one and what I do is I
just basically swirl my brush in the
bronzing powder lightly I'm barely
touching it so what I do then is place a
brush on my contour and start doing
circular shaped motions upwards never go
below that line we just created so just
circular shape motions on your contour
line going up again for this I keep it
all to the side of my face this bronzer
does not go into that curve now what
bronzer is also great for is for that
big forehead of mine so I take more of
the bronzer and as we just did I just
follow the hairline and I just buff and
blend the bronzer in and then also what
I do is blend it in to my neck of course
I also have days where I'm like okay
Nick you stepped too far with this one
today you need to take it down a few
what I do then is take my face powder
this is by benefit it's the hello
flawless powder and my Real Techniques
blush brush I just go into my face
powder and then what I do is just soften
the entire feel of everything this will
also help blend certain parts a little
bit nicer and it will just make the
overall look a little bit softer now
what you would automatically go to is
blush but no no the trick for a
perfectly highlighted skin is highlight
first and blush after I usually find
that if I put blush on first and
highlight after the highlight kinda
looks like it's laying over top it's
just not blending easily into the skin
it's not cohesive it's not beautiful and
when you do highlight your first and
blush after the highlighter just melts
into the skin and looks beautiful
my favorite highlighter by far and you
guys know this by now is my Becca
shimmering skin Perfector pressed in
moonstone I lived like this I can
not live without this it has knocked all
the other highlighters out of my world
this is what I use on a daily basis I
cannot live without this I love this and
my perfect highlighting brush is by
Inglot and it's the four SS brush I use
this all the time and again I've tried
so many brushes for the perfect
highlighting application and they all
fail in comparison to this one I take
the powder on one side of the brush and
then I tap it off I place it directly
under the side of my eye so right here I
place it there and then softly I start
blending it out and down now I like a
strong highlight so I always go back in
and apply more and I also come right on
the ball of my cheek so that when I'm
smiling you really see that glistening
then I like to take the bubby round
share powder brush and this is my
favorite front blush because it really
blows up the blush color really nicely
and I take my favorite blush which is
luminoso by Milani of course Luminoso
and just on the apples of the cheeks so
I always smile you can see that little
ball pub out right here right on top
that is where we're focusing on first
and then I always take a little bit more
and I blend it to the back into my
contour and bronzer and this just makes
everything melts in together and make it
look seamless and then if I really feel
like it I cook that line so what you
want to do then and I will make a
separate video on this very soon all
about cooking makeup I take a powder
that's light enough for my face and
those regular old white triangle sponges
I grab a ton of that powder and that
will make it more prominent plus also it
will highlight the space that hasn't got
anything on it yet so I take the powder
and I just go underneath that first line
that we created and usually on light
days I just keep it on this portion
here because that is where it tends to
get a little bit messy for me and no I
do have to repeat myself
we will not be leaving it like this we
will let this set for now so it will
cook and it will actually highlight and
clean up the skin and after just like
five minutes we will brush it away and
it's nicely highlighted and clean and
this is I only do this if I'm going for
like a more extreme look or if I want my
contour to be on fleek on a day to day
basis I do not contour my nose
I usually don't because I'm not really I
don't know I just I know I'm not that
person I do highlight my nose on a daily
basis and I again take my Becca
shimmering skin perfecter pressed in
moonstone and this little Sigma pencil
brush like this and my trick is that I
highlight the tip of my nose and what
this does is it just tilts the tip of
the nose up a little bit more and it
makes it appear more cute Ian and thin
and nice so I just got right on the very
top tip and just and that's it just like
that that's it then I also love
highlighting the bridge of my nose but
right in this little dent right here so
right in that little spot highlight it
and go down on towards the bridge of
your nose a little bit and in between
the brows that is how I highlight my
nose I usually also do my Cupid's bow
I'm wearing lip gloss now so that's
going to be quite something but we can
try and then if you want to look extra
glowy take a little bit and go right
above your arch of your brow right there
whew right there that's where you want
to go so then it highlights here here
here here here and if you want you can
also do your chin and then you will look
super super glowy and luminous and
beautiful so I think it's time to brush
this away and as you can see
just leaves the contour looking super
sharp and defined and perfect and that
guy's is how I like to highlight and
contour and blush up my face every day
this is how I do it this is how I
approach the entire contouring and
highlighting and blushing with powders I
think it just leaves your skin looking
super sculpted and glowy and luminous
and just perfect really yeah I'm gonna
do the other side now because I look
crazy and as the guys that is how I
contour and highlight and blush my face
