to like a pro installment video today's
video is going to be how to contour your
nose like a pro so I'm going to show you
a couple of ways on how to contour your
nose from like a really wearable no one
can really see it type of way to the
extreme I'm talking drag queens extreme
yeah without any further ado if you want
to know how to contour your nose like a
pro then please keep on watching so the
first technique I'm going to teach you
is a technique that I've used in many
videos before and I learned this from
miss fame a drag queen here on YouTube
and the trick is to take a high
shimmering product and I chose a pigment
and this is the the balm over shadow
pigment in no money no honey and what
you want to use that with is a pencil
brush and this is a pencil bar shape so
take some of that shimmery
pigment and literally all you want to do
is place it on the highest tip of your
nose and even a little bit above it and
what they will do is it will sort of
lift the tip of your nose up and making
it really small and cute okay said a
heist above my nose is right here and
I'm gonna go a little bit above and
place that payment a boom and of course
this is way too much for right now but
you can see that the tip of my nose sort
of lifts up it becomes a more cute and
small tip and it's sort of you know it's
a nice a small tip and then to make that
a little bit more wearable you just take
your foundation brush and you just tap
it in and like that you have a really
natural way of highlighting the tip of
your nose and it just lifts it all
the next trick you can do with a liquid
or a powder today I'm going to work with
powders only so what you want to do is
take a powder or concealer that is about
to the three shades lighter than your
skin tone this is the Maybelline fit me
powder in 115 and I'm going to use a
little bit of white powder one thing
that makes your nose look extremely
small is when the sides of your nose are
really highlighted and sharp so
basically if you just make everything on
the outside lighter this part comes out
and makes it look thinner
do you see that by sort of placing a
really light color on top of the size of
your nose and making the top of the nose
as thin as you want
you can really sculpt the look without
adding shadows to it and then you can
also go underneath the eyes and you know
light that up and just get their
Kardashian going so can you see how
already that sort of thin shape is
becoming a thing let me show you just
want to make your nose thin so the
closer you put the lightness together
here the smaller your nose will look and
definitely also go to the bottom of the
nose you don't want the top of your nose
to be thin and then the rest of your
nose to be wide okay and then do the
Kardashian what you want to do with this
is it blended in I'm going to take a
brush and this is my new Zhu Eva se
shape brush and we love this this is a
weave at the moment and you just want to
start blending in them powders but don't
be too harsh on them at the nose because
you don't want to sort of erase all of
the work that you've done again just a
reminder this works a lot better with
concealer and then really take a
concealer that is pigmented and stays on
but you can just see how that frames the
nose without going overboard
the third step is where the heavy-duty
stuff comes in and where you actually
have to take a contouring powder and I
am using my illamasqua eyeshadow in
heroine for this if there's one thing
that bugs me when I see someone on
YouTube contour their nose it's that
they take quite a big brush and they
just go like ah I'm doing the size of
when y'all's blah blah blah done but
what they're actually doing is making
that site that we just lighten up with
powder darker giving the entire nose a
broader and wider fuel again in order to
make your nose look small with a
contouring powder is to actually make a
new shape let me demonstrate I'm going
to take this brush by zoeva and it's the
Apache crease brush and I'm going to
start off by brushing it underneath the
tip of my nose so I'm going to sort of
make a C shape there
now from there just go up to the nose
you can see how the tip is becoming more
rounded and lift it up now I'm going to
take a little bit of a bigger brush also
by zoeva it's a crease brush and from
that side of that little C shape we made
that sign go straight up you don't want
to take a big Brush and you know just go
like that because you're actually making
this part darker again then what you
want to do is brush it into the nose on
here sort of connecting it to the front
of your brow boom not to make it even
stronger take that same puff where you
apply your lighter powders with again
and do the same as we did before in step
2 and sort of put it right next to the
contour you're just you just placed and
then what you also want to do is take
that lighter eyeshadow again and put it
on the bridge of your nose now of course
no one's going to walk the streets like
this except for all the drag queens on
RuPaul's Drag Race so I'm going to take
that same bigger blending brush from
zoeva it's the face shaped brush and I'm
going to
this in I'm going to buff it in actually
make it soft and pretty and you can just
go over top you know really blend that
bad boy it and once you buff that in and
really made it a part of your face
you're left with a really small empty
cute nose and I have a normal to small
nose to begin with so I don't need all
the nose contouring on a daily basis but
if you are someone who's suffering from
a somewhat wider bigger nose this trick
does the work for you I absolutely love
this technique because it just changes
up the face and I love it so onto the
last technique and I don't feel like
anyone really needs this it's just to
have a little bit of fun and show you
how a drag queen knows what look uh
Namita techniques that I just showed you
are appropriate for out and about and
just really slimming down your nose but
this one is just to have some fun and
show you how a drag queen nose will look
like on me so I'm gonna steep through
this and show you me
and that guy's completes my Hasek on
Torino like a pro 101c yeah that's it I
hope this was useful and helpful to some
of you out there I know a lot of people
are like okay this video had no purpose
for me but I hope that some of you found
this helpful

making your noses look a little bit
smaller so thinking is so much for
