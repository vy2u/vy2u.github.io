you just saw my video with Jeffrey star
but I haven't filmed a video in I think
three weeks and it feels so good to be
back we have improved our setup we have
changed a couple of things and it feels
so good to be back and welcome to
today's new video so if you follow me on
Instagram Twitter snapchat you know that
I just came back from a work week in
Mexico we went to Cancun and I did all
the hair and makeup for the swim coach
shoots for this and the upcoming year
and I was doing swim COEs owner alluri I
was doing her makeup for a shoot and
somehow our conversation went to curling
eyelashes and as you know I have the
worst eyelashes on planet Earth they
stick down they don't really want to
curl and just my lashes suck they do I
hate you it's so far in my 21 year old
life I've only found one mascara that
can keep my lashes up during the day
without it going down eventually so I
did Lori's makeup and I became to the
eyelashes portion and I asked her do you
curl your lashes and she went yes do you
and I have a special trick for it and
this is where it gets interesting she
took me to the restroom where a blow
dryer was she took her eyelash curler
and a blow dryer he started blowing and
totally fascinated I went poori you're
st. you're st. it's brilliant when you
heat up your eyelash curler it sort of
transforms into a curling iron it's hot
and heat always make stuff stay on
longer and curl longer it's just the
same as hair you can curl your hair with
a coal curling iron
once day you can curl your hair with a
hot curling iron mm-hmm it's the exact
same with your lashes so I'm going to
demonstrate I'm going to demonstrate you
can already see how my lashes are stick
straight to the bottom what you want to
do is grab your blow-dryer and aim for
this portion or right there then make it
warm and then let it cool off enough
for you to bear the heat but not that
you're burning your skin of course I
might want to add that if you try this
out it's all you're on your own don't
hold me responsible for this if you burn
yourself because you're on your own use
your own caution you're your own boss
you do you okay let's do it
you kind of feel with your finger if
it's hot it's very hot kind of let it
cool down so you can actually put it on
your skin curl hold it for like 10 to 15
seconds I have an a9 a nice squeeze in
between the seconds let go oh can we see
this oh
and I always like to go in second time
to really get the curl in then
immediately right after go in with your
mascara I'm using lead makeup studio
waterproof 3d extra black it's the only
one that can keep my curl wiggle through
the lashes mm-hmm and bam can we see how
freakin curly that is they are up they
are standing up and they will stay that
way because you just curl your lashes
like a curling iron look straight up
I'm obsessed Laurie I love you okay
let's do it again oh oh now you should
know that I have the type of lashes that
even when you curl them normally like
after 10 seconds down like mm did you
curl don't think so okay yes mom
that's the guys that is the secret to
having perfectly curled lashes all day
long
Laurie from Simcoe you are amazing you
saved so many girls and boys out there
yes yes yes that's it guys I hope you
enjoyed if you try out this technique
