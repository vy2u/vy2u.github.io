quick tip video on the Kevin Murphy
color book color bugs this is a perfect
way to create your own dip dye without
actually having to commit to actually
dyeing your hair this is sort of like a
limited edition dip dye for your hair
and they come in three colors they
actually have four now but this is the
orange and it becomes a really nice
peachy color and you have the purple and
you have pink and recently came out a
white which is absolutely amazing I
can't wait to sort of have the white and
then put white highlights through my
really blond hair or just a wide dip dye
I absolutely love it and I can't wait
till it arrives here today I'm just
gonna give you a quick demo on how I
applied the color books by Kevin Murphy
I absolutely love it and um I
instagrammed this with like a pony tail
and I had this coloring as well and yeah
I absolutely love this and if you want
to know how to get this then please keep
on watching okay so the first thing you
want to do is sort of protect yourself
from the dust of the powder from the
color bucks falling down so just take a
towel and just wrap that around your
shirt and then make sure you protect
your leggings as well then just take the
back piece of your hair and spray it
with hairspray this will kind of give
you a hair sort of like an adhesive for
the color bug I take her color bub of
choice I'm going to take the orange one
and I love this one because they become
sort of like a peachy color and then you
want to lay your hair in the palm of
your hand and then just start rubbing it
on and yes your hands will get really
really dirty but we're going to use that
to our advantage later on so now just
kind of start rubbing your color bug in
and this will get the sort of color
going okay once you get the beginning
take what is on your hand and sort of
brush it upwards so kind of give
yourself a really nice gradient slash
dip dye effect so actually what is on
our hands
we're going to use Sarah
hitch to kind of blend the edges in okay
to finish it off just take some
hairspray spray it on and this will kind
of lock it into place and as long as you
sprayed with hairspray it won't transfer
onto your clothes and you will be
absolutely safe so just do this
throughout the entire part of your hair
and then you will have a dip dye
and then once you take your brush and
just brush everything out of it and make
it look softer
you have your own dip dye you know what
I always do is just to rehearse spray
everything a bit just to be sure and
just to make it stay on longer and this
is how you can use the color bucks by
Kevin Murphy and I absolutely love this
this is so it's like such a
revolutionary idea because if you feel
like having a dip dye but don't want to
have like the commitment to actually
dyeing your hair this is perfect because
this will last about a day or two if
you're really really like blond like me
this will stain your hair a teeny tiny
bit but after one shower and washing
your hair most of it is gone there will
be like a slightest stain there um but I
actually like that because I loved it
guys so this is the orange color and
Kevin Murphy also has purple and bright
hot pink so yeah that is just my quick
tip on how you can have a dip dye for
like the holiday so for like a party I'm
actually going to a birthday party right
now and I absolutely love this of course
you could go even more extreme and then
when you have the orange here blend the
pink above it and then sort of have like
my little pony hair which is absolutely
awesome if you like that as well so yeah
