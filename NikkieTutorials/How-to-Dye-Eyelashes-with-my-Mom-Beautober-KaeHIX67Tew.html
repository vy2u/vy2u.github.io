Instagram which is making tutorials if
you want to follow me on Instagram I
posted a picture of me getting my
eyelashes dyed so um they got a darker
color and people are like what is done
what are you doing like what so today
I'm here to show you a little bit more
about that it's called an eyelash and
eyebrow dyeing treatment and my mom gets
it in her salon
it's just dyeing your eyelashes and your
eyebrows into a darker color see ya
today I'm going to show you that
treatment and if you're wondering who's
hands are on my face the entire video
those are my mom's I'm she's she's doing
the treatment to me because she's doing
this inner salon because some people are
going to ask what dye she uses she is
the effective seal eyelash and eyebrow
tint in number one pure black and number
two for my eyebrows and that is actually
it let's go right ahead to the treatment
and let's show you how it kind of works
and yeah my mom starts off by putting a
rubber latex sort of shield under my
lashes this will prevent my skin from
staining
then she applies Vaseline to my eyelids
again to prevent staining and tingling
or stinging from the dye now my mom
gently lays to die on top of my
eyelashes and make sure all the lashes
are covered
you
now with a q-tip she cleans up my lash
line for any possible stains or tingling
now let that settle for about 10 minutes
in the meantime my mom also dyed my
eyebrows a light brown shade this to
give them a little bit more definition
she let the brow settle in for about
four minutes
removing the dye from the eyebrows is
done really easily by just taking a wet
cotton pad and just sliding the die off
the eyelash dye was removed by first
sliding some of it onto that rubber
latex shield with a q-tip
then with a soaking wet cotton pad my
mom just started washing the die off
make sure to keep your eyes closed
because when this comes into your eyes
it stings like crap
and that is how my mom died my eyelashes
and my eyebrows was wrong ah
and that way blonde people also can have
dark eyelashes and dark eyebrows so that
is it that is what I wanted to show you
today for a full list of every single
product Q's gift to MOA setting
