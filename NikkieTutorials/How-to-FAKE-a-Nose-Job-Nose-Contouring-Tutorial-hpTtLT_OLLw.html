new super cool techniques on how to
contour your nose even snacks here and
I've been applying those techniques to
my nose for the last couple of weeks and
a lot of you have been wanting to see an
updated nose contour video on this so
here I am doing it for you yeah let's
grab our brushes let's grab our
contouring corners and it's time to
snatch this nose I only use a couple of
products to really get my nose so
looking tiny and snatched and perfect so
um here we go the only contouring powder
I trusted nowadays is by giving a Kwan
this is the medium sculpting powder and
the only nose contouring brush I trusted
nowadays is this one by luck see Beauty
this right here is the luxe E 182 brush
and it comes with a fluffier side and a
more sharp dense side the fluffy side is
where it's at and I know a lot of people
do cream contouring and then go after
with powder contouring but I just feel
like that is not for me I don't know how
I don't know why but when I cream
contour my nose it just looks wrong and
muddy and and with powder it looks bomb
alright let's do it the first thing I do
is tap the fluffy side of the 182 into
my contouring powder and only take I'm
like barely touching the powder and then
tap up axis you really want to do this
what happened to me in the beginning
when I first contour my nose
I didn't tap off the excessive amounts
of powder which when it first like when
it initially hits your nose that brush
it leaves like a dense mark of brown and
then you try to blend that in but it's
still a little bit more dense and
intense where you first hit it so you
definitely want to tap it in that powder
and tap away the excess and I like to
start about halfway into my nose so
right around here I start brushing in
the contouring powder now of course the
closer you apply the lines to work to
each other the smaller your nose is
going to look if you think about the
drag world if you want a really tiny
nose what you do is bring these two
lines really close together and they
won't
look tiny so the the smaller you want
your nose to look the more towards each
other we bring the lines so I'm just
going to brush it in I applied very
light pressure onto this brush nothing
harsh and just right here start smudging
in that contour some more and put it on
the other side as well and again the
closer you put this one towards the
other one the smaller your nose is going
to look and then I only go about halfway
up onto my nose I don't bring it in here
and go with that entire brow shape and
nose line shape
some people go here and then go all the
way there and connect it to that crease
but for me lately all I've been doing is
like the center here like that then what
I do is take a little bit more and I'm
going to cut my tip so right here
underneath the highest point of my nose
I also block it with contouring see how
it kind of and then whatever is left in
that brush I used to connect the lines
to that bottom portion I just applied so
kind of like this now of course this is
way too much you definitely do not want
to walk around like this so what I do to
really clean up that nose and really
make it smaller now is go in with loose
powder and my damp Beauty Blender I'm
going to pick up some powder and with
this we're going to clean it right
beside the line of her contour and this
will sharpen it and clean it up and
really make it look tiny so right beside
the contouring line go in with a face
powder and clean up see what I mean I
know super intimidating right now but it
will look perfect in the end so other
side
okay now that you look like Squidward
it's time to work this in and make it
look perfect but because we just cleaned
it up and made this super sharp you want
us to soften it a little so I'm going to
take a powder brush and my face powder
this one today is by Charlotte Tilbury
and to soften this entire look you want
to pick a powder and basically from the
side of your face drag it over top of
the contour and soften it that way so
see how I'm coming from the side of my
nose and going over top of that contour
slightly to soften the harshness of it
and see how much softer that already
looks this way want and then one of my
favorite tricks that Mustaine taught me
is to pick up a little bit more cat
contouring powder and contour the very
side of your nose so right here until
you've reached it like air her that
really snatches the nose together
and of course as a finishing touch you
really want to bring in light to where
you want to lift the nose up so we're
gonna highlight and I'm going to use
this sleek highlighting palette in
solstice I'm going to take this color
right here and just put my pinky I pick
up a little bit of the highlighting
powder and basically what that will do
is kind of take out the tip of your nose
and we could tiny and cute and lifted
and that's what I want so right at the
tip now if you're like girl I went too
far with that shine you can always go
back in with a powder brush and kind of
take it down a little you know what I'm
not because I love it and the guy says
