video on how you can prevent your
concealer from creasing on the last one
I've gotten a couple of comments telling
me that it worked on the first few days
and then after that it stopped working
for some reason or for some people it
just didn't work at all whatsoever so I
tried to figure out new ways of
preventing concealer from creasing
underneath the eyes and I have found
another way and I might go as far as to
say that I might like this method better
because it also highlights the under eye
area beautifully so if my last video
didn't work for you this one might work
so much a lip liner today and it's
picking we want to get lip fillers I
want to go on but lisa rinna level
anyways way that I knew further adue if
you want to get creaseless then stay
tuned alright so I already went ahead
and applied my foundation and the
foundation I used today was by Mac this
is face and body in c1 and mineralized
moisture in NC 15 okay now it's
concealer time and before we do that the
first thing we want to do is get rid of
all the foundation that is underneath
our eyes so just take your beloved ring
fingers and tap it away and in between
wipe it off on a paper towel or like a
normal towel just get rid of the under
eye concealer dunk junk gunk all right
now we're going to go into the benefit
stay don't stray and light/medium this
is what it looks like and what this is
it's sort of like an eyeshadow base but
it's also a concealer base it's marketed
as a concealer and eyeshadow base what
we're going to do is just take that out
and put three dots underneath our eyes
dot dot all right we got that that went
well
and now again take your ring fingers and
blend this all in and especially where
you crease first make sure it gets all
up in there and benefits stayed on stray
also has a lot of coverage so it kind of
helps concealing also so that's great
for a concealer today I'll be using a
mixture
of two the first one I'll be using is
make up forevers full coverage full
cover and this is the color 3 and then
also max a select cover up concealer in
nw15
max the select cover up in nw15 so
together this is going to be a new
mixture okay I'm going to pick that
concealer up with a brush the brush I'm
using is by Sigma it's the e60 and what
I'll be doing is placing the concealer
under my eyes first
dot-dot-dot just to stay in the theme of
the primer face whatever then also I
highlight my face using concealer so
first I place just a tiny bit on my
forehead then the bridge of my nose all
the way down to the tail trim so that is
where I can seal I now take my Real
Techniques sponge I wet it so it's damp
and I'm now going to buffed the
concealer in that is not underneath my
eyes and then now I blend in everything
that's underneath my eyes
now the second magic trick I found to
stop my concealer from creasing is to
get a loose powder I am using the makeup
studio translucent powder extra-fine in
number one and just one of those regular
old triangle white sponges you might
want to grab a towel because things
might get dirty in a bit and what we're
going to do is with the white sponge we
pick up a gunk load of powder this bunch
is dry it's absolutely dry nothing has
happened to it and you just want to take
a gun clod of powder and we're going to
cook the under eye area I've talked
about cooking in my Khloe Kardashian
video a couple of weeks ago where I
cooked my contour and what cooking does
is sort of highlighting it but also I
found that if you cook your under eye
area it prevents everything from
creasing it works it absolutely works it
works so before we set the concealer and
before we go in with all that powder you
first want to go back in with your
sponge and make sure all the creases are
gone okay those are gone I'm now going
to take the powder and the sponge and
literally press it over top of the
concealer and just lay it on I can hear
all the natural beauties go oh my
goodness and literally all you want to
do is let this set for about five
minutes what I usually do now is do my
brows and conceal wherever I feel like I
need more concealing and then once I go
to powder my entire face I wipe this
away and that will get rid of all the
creases in your under eye area life it
has helped me so much and I have options
now I can stop my concealer from
creasing using a damp sponge and powder
like I showed you in the first video but
I can also use this technique now and
this highlights the under-eye area so
much and so beautifully I know a lot of
you right now are like but won't you
keep seeing that gunk of powder
underneath once you wipe it all away No
if you really wipe it away good if
you're if you do it like if you do a
good job at wiping it away
it will just look like normal powder
Matt skin so I'm going to go ahead and
let this cook for a couple minutes and
do my brows and do the rest of my makeup
and then I'll be back
alright so I've done my brows and all
the concealer that I needed and I
already powdered my face and now with my
Real Techniques blush brush I'm just
going to wipe away the excess powder and
not only as I said will it prevent the
concealer from creasing it also really
beautifully highlights the under eye
area and that guy's is another way to
prevent your under-eye concealer from
creasing I hope this one works if the
last one didn't for you I wouldn't think
