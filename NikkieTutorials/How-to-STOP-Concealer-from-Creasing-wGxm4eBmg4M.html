struggle these past six months because I
was diagnosed with a severe case of
under-eye creasing and it might not seem
like such a big of a problem because you
can just put Chado over top but it was
really starting to get to me man like
these under-eye creases and these all
these lines it got to me really started
taking a toll of my life okay I guess
everyone and anyone has seen the
under-eye creases in my tutorials lately
thank you for pointing it out 100
billion times thank you it's not like I
didn't see him myself
so as you know I took a little break
from YouTube these past few weeks
and in this past few weeks I tried a
different technique to get rid of the
under-eye creases every day and I found
the solution it has totally changed in
my life I am crease free underneath my
eyes life is good life is good again I
can finally live like a normal person
again okay so without any further ado if
you want to know how to prevent your
concealer from creasing then please keep
on watching alright guys so the first
thing I recommend doing is doing
foundation first concealer after we kind
of want to lay down a base and then see
where we want to perspectiva more and
then we can set it without creasing so
the foundation I'll be using today is
the Studio Fix fluid by Mac and I'm in
the color and say 15 and first I like to
stipple that all over my face and then
blend in with the brush and the brush
I'm using is the Sigma f80 8 a quick tip
is to not apply any foundation
underneath the eyes you want to think of
it as the more products you put
underneath those eyes the more palettes
there actually is to gunk up increase so
the less products underneath the eyes
the better so now that we've got the
skin looking like a million bucks
and the under eyes like a mess it's time
for the concealer and it's time for the
trick the concealer I love most is the
Pro Longwear concealer by Mac and I'm in
the color nc15 and the pro longwear
concealer is marketed as a concealer
that does not crease lies lies lies and
nothing but lies Pro Longwear Croesus it
just does it does
matter how smooth or how unwrinkle er
under eye area is increases no matter
what
especially on me I have this really
prominent little fold in my under eye
area that concealer tends to gunk up and
increase on me so what you want to do is
you want to apply your concealer doesn't
matter what type of concealer whenever
you like I'm gonna use two Pro Longwear
and instead of working it in with a
brush like these Sigma X 86 which I did
for so long you want to take a sponge
you can take a Beauty Blender they come
in a bunch of colors now or you can take
like I do the Real Techniques sponge
grab a sponge you need a sponge and what
you want to do is a blend in the
concealer with the sponge and as soon as
you like what you see you immediately
want to go in with powder now the trick
is this sponge is damp I don't know how
and I don't know what kind of technology
does this but once you blend in the
concealer with the sponge and with the
still damp sponge take the powder and
set it with powder immediately right
after it does increase so what you will
need is the sealer a sponge that you
have wet and is now damn and powder and
the powder I'll be using for an under
eye area is the laura mercier secret
brightening powder because I really like
this for photography so first I apply
the concealer right underneath my eyes
and you can go for whatever concealer
shape that you like I just like
highlighting a little bit of her cheeks
tool because it lifts my cheeks now
comes apart with your sponge and I'm
gonna work really quickly to not get any
creasing I'm already opening my powder
before I do the concealer part with the
sponge look up and blend in the
concealer until you like it
okay so once that's blended in I quickly
move to the other eye then once both
eyes are blended in you want to go over
it one more time to make sure there's no
creasing and then quickly dip the tip of
your wet sponge into the powder and go
over top and set it and then blend in
the powder seamlessly and that's it this
way your concealer underneath your eyes
won't crease it won't budge it won't go
anywhere plus what's also great about
this is that this now acts as a perfect
eyes shadow base and that guys is how I
present my under eye concealer from
creasing it was definitely a struggle
and it was this close to giving up but
I'm so glad that I found out about this
technique so for a full list of every
single product mentioned and used go to
