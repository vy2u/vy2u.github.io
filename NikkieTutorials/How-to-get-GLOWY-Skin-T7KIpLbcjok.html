on how you can create beautiful luminous
glowy dewy skin because everyone wants
beautiful luminous glowy dewy skin I'm
going to show you my favorite way of
transforming any matte foundation look
into this glowy luminous dream see if
you would like to know how scab eautiful
glowy skin then please keep on watching
so before we start with the glow I think
it's very very important to prime your
face to make the glow lasts all day
personally when I'm going for a more
glowy look I rather apply a matte
foundation and glow it up using powders
and other products instead of going with
a super dewy glowy foundation and then
being an oil slick at the end of the day
but if you do want to start off straight
away with a dewy glowy foundation by all
means do that but prime girl prime for
primer today I'll be using my Nivea men
aftershave balm I've talked about this
before this is the best primer on the
market because it's second most
ingredient is glycerin and glycerin
makes products stick to it and I've
gotten a lot of questions is the Manolis
scent of it goes away after a while for
me personally when I apply this I do
smell the men portion of this product
but once i put foundation over top and
once i'm done doing my makeup that scent
is completely gone so you're safe people
won't smell you and go like cheering
aftershave so for my primer today the
Nivea men aftershave balm and following
through with Smashbox primer water when
it comes to foundation it is completely
up to you what kind of finish you like
most as I said I personally love going
for a more matte flat foundation and
sparkling and glowing up with products
later on but of course you could go for
a luminous more glowy foundation also if
you only have matte foundations a little
trick to transform them into a glowy
perfect foundation is to grab your
foundation this is Studio Fix fluid by
Mac and you can mix it with a liquid
highlighter I suggest the Becca
shimmering skin Perfector
they come in a bunch of colors and if
you don't have that you can mix your
foundation with a pigment so the one i
really suggest is the bombs no money no
honey / shadow pots for my foundation
today I'm going to go in with as I said
Mac Studio Fix fluid and a little tiny
bit of my aqua foundation bye cogan
dough into 13 and my liquid highlighter
by Becca this is pearl so I'm just
taking my Sigma brush and applying the
foundation all over my skin and buff it
in
now just follow through and use your
favorite concealer do your brows do your
eye makeup and then we will continue
another change all right guys so let's
get started on the glow four
highlighters I have two all-time
favorites my number one will always be
my Becca shimmering skin Perfector
pressed in moonstone
this is just a glowing goddess in a in a
powder form this transforms your entire
complexion into a glowing power bitch
and what makes me love this even more is
that it gives you that intense glow but
it still looks like it comes from within
so it's like the super intense bitching
glow from within and my second most
favorite highlighter is by the balm this
is mary lou manizer and why this is
second is this is just a tiny bit more
extreme than moonstone moonstone as I
said has a little bit more from the glow
from within but super bitchin glowy and
with mary lou manizer you can put this
on your cheekbones and people from space
will see this like astronauts will be
out there girl is glowing today so Becca
is pow-pow this is pow pow pow so for
today's video I'm going to use the pow
pow pow minis mary lou manizer by the
balm now my favorite brush to highlight
with I have two this one is by revi derm
this is their blush brush I just think
this is the perfect size and just I love
this and my second favorite highlighter
brush is by Inglot and this is the four
SS so today I'm going to use the revered
durham brush and the bomb and just pick
up a tiny bit and the most important
part of your face to highlight is the
tops of your cheekbones if you want to
look glowing tops of cheekbones right
here look at that and then with circular
motions blend it out and then what I
like to do is smile and bring it on the
ball of your cheek so when you're
smiling
now this will give you a glowy finish
but it's wearable and you can still go
about your day now if you want to go to
the extreme glowy finish grab some more
and what I like to do is apply
highlighter
right in the dent of your nose so your
nose kind of hits back to your skull
somewhere on your face
right there in that little goop I like
to apply highlighter then also a tiny
bit above the arch of your brow we see
that oh yes we can then to make this
flow a little bit nicer also it's nice
to highlight the brow bone
I love highlighting my Cupid's bow
because it makes your lips look fuller I
always do this
and then just make two stripeys and you
call it a day okay so the next step is
optional but I I do this when I want to
look like
glowy if I want to look like this I look
like this but when I want to look super
glowy I take a little tiny bit and on
top of my chin just a tiniest bit
because this I find that glow on the
chin can make you look sweaty and then
my favorite is the tip of the nose it
lifts your nose up it makes a cute and
thin it's just my favorite trick nose
look at that difference
y'all spit job that is pretty damn
glowing if you ask me but we can take it
further if you want to look SuperDuper
glowy but still no look glowy but call
it a day there stop here that's all you
have to do now to take the glow a little
bit further and also glow up your
bronzer what I suggest is using a more
tan bronzy highlight my favorite for
that is my Bobbi Brown
this is the this is the highlight powder
in bronze glow but you can use any
bronzy tan highlighter powder and I go
right over my bronzer and where I
contour and that will illuminate the
bronzer also and just give it a very
glowy dewy finish so that way your
entire face has is do it has this glow
it has this yes now if for some reason
you feel like you've taken it a little
bit too far take your powder brush and
you can just
often the shine down a bit so right here
it's a little bit too much for me I can
just soften the shine using my powder
brush now the last trick to give
yourself that perfect glowy dewy skin
and this I picked up from desi Perkins
here on YouTube check her out I'm going
to take fix+
and with fix+ you're just going to mist
your highlighting portion right here on
the tops of your cheekbones and that
will sort of take any powder that looks
like powder on the skin it transforms it
into something more dewy and glowy so
just take your fix plus close your eyes
and spritz the side of your face where
you highlighted and that will make it
even more glowy and dewy and that just
transforms you into a glowing goddess
and that guys is how I like to create
beautiful luminous glowy dewy skin
perfect for summer or for when the
motorcycle rides across your house so
you can stop talking while filming now
