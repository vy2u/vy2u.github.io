on Gwen Stefani's big big hair
when's the funny is a beautiful woman
and she has beautiful hair and beautiful
makeup in every single video in the past
it was a little bit less beautiful but
still um in my rock chick video I have
one picture on daily booths on the side
really big hair and like everyone wanted
to know how I did it so today I'm
showing you how I did it but today I
added some more curls to make it more
Gwen Stefani like so if you want to know
I had to get this like big Quinn stuff
on here or just take some tips and
tricks on how to make like only this
bigger or make these curls right here or
make the curl right here if you just
want to know how to like make care of
your hair a little bit bigger at the top
or the bottom or anything and please
keep watching the first thing we're
going to do is we're gonna apply a you
protectant thing and I'm gonna use my
Chi's silk infusion just put that in
your hair mainly in the ends because
that is where your hair is most damaged
hair would take up like that you're
gonna take a big big brush and then just
brush your hair to get it everywhere the
you're protectin see the curling iron
we're using is from the hake I got it
there at the auto shop and um this the
and this is by Ella fate so it's a 1 1/4
inch curling iron this is my new baby um
I love it part your front I'm gonna
follow the highest point of my arch up
so the first thing we're gonna do is
we're going to make three big curls on
our hair and then flip them back so it's
day fun so we're going to make one here
we're going to make one
the back I'm gonna make one here and
that already gives like a lot of like
texture and curl to the hair but not too
much and then from there on we can work
even further with it I'm going to show
you one and then the other two I'm
probably gonna like speed forward or
something you're gonna take a strand of
hair like something like that so
something like that I learned a great
trick from one of my friends she told me
if you want to curl outwards keep the
clamp in front so whatever you do keep
it in front so here front front front so
first I'm gonna go through the entire
hair then go in a bit and go a little
bit further until the entire hair is in
it like most of it so uh as you can see
most of it is in now the other just wrap
it around okay clamp it out and now
you're gonna pin it back so you're gonna
take that curl and push it up they'll
clamp it down to your head like that so
this is gonna cool down and then when
you take it out it stays life is bound
to curl as I said keep the clip in the
front so clean preparing it go through
it entirely and that means you almost
reached the end curl it in and go out
and in you just want to make sure that
the ends are completely in it and you do
that I just go through the entire hair
and then clamp it in and then go back up
so the ends go into the curling iron as
well so you now I have those three big
curls and you're gonna let them cool
down in those clips and now we can work
on the rest of the hair so you just take
a little piece of hair okay little piece
take your curling iron clamp forward
and just curl some random loose strands
but not all the way just like keep it
like that so don't go all the way in
just the ends a bit just curl them in a
bit you want nothing like dramatic and
that is going to stay like that so
you're not going to go and clip it up
and do things with it just let it hang
there now do this with more parts of
your hair just to give it a nice general
curl so curly ayran go through there
curl it in go a little bit out to get
the ends in curl
don't go entirely in because you're only
doing that at the top and then wait you
have to wait a lot with curling irons so
you see those three curls right there
let them hang don't do anything with
them and just do the other side but the
big three curls right there I'll cool
down so you're gonna let them free so
I'm gonna define it in some pieces and
then curling it with the clam Ford and
do the same but then just with your bang
area like that you can do this on the
other side as well if you like if you
have shorter hairs right there
so what we're now going to do is tease a
little bit of the back of the hair so
I'm gonna take a section and then spray
some hairspray in it this is just the
element spray it cool down a bit and
tease they already open a lot of volume
at the back that's what you want and I'm
gonna grab my secret ingredient
this is OSIS plus by Schwartz this is
gonna be a no-no now I'm gonna take
Alice's plus by Schwab cuff and this
powder is called dust it and what this
does it makes you a really rough and
textured and you can add volume like no
other to your hair
I'm just going to apply that to some
places you see the powder broke it in
and there it gets so texture that you
can do anything with it and look at it
by just moving it a bit it stands up
this powder if you want big hair without
seizing it too much dust it one downside
to dust it it makes your hair kind of
greasy because it's a powder but it
makes it greasy because it's so textured
okay also in here such a weird powder
but I love it
now take a brush and brush some of those
curls out to make them nice and soft
enough we're big hair to tease the
overall a bit more and in this part
right here we're gonna flip it over and
that is gonna be dramatic as hell and I
love it and then it's a finishing touch
at a lot of hairspray to make it stay
where it is man and we said hairspray
you can like scrunch it a bit and make
it even more look at it like put some
airspace crunch
big hair and that completes your BIC
Gwen Stefani inspired like soft curly
just like big hair if you're completely
hate big hair you can just take some
tips and tricks' out of this video just
like get some of this OSIS plus powder
or how you can make like soft curls on
the top like the three things I did or
like at the bottom so you don't have to
make it as big as I did it's just um
when I go big I wanted to be mega big so
thank you guys so much for watching and
that is how I get my dailybooth hair but
at the daddy boots picture it was a
little bit more straight but that's
basically all we did it so I hope you
guys enjoyed and I love you bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
