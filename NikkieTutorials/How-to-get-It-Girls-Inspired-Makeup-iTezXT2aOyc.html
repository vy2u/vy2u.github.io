it groans makeup and basically when I
think of it girls I think of Gregory
gorgeous on YouTube I think of you have
this Dutch girl in the Netherlands and
her name is joy joy something joy from
the failed oh joy fails when I think of
it girls I think of Paris Hilton I think
of Kim Kardashian I think of you know
eight girls you know the kind of girls
that are in the news for actually doing
nothing but having a reality show or
something or having their own clothing
line or um perfume or you know they've
always like the most amazing fake lashes
on the most amazing jewelry beautiful
eyes beautiful everything so today I was
inspired by all of those girls to do a
it girl inspired tutorial and I tried
dressing up like one
so I edit my extensions and just armor
ring and the Scrabble ring on my website
I list everything what I have used with
the colors and eyeshadows and lipstick
as well as Alma jewelry as well as my
hair extensions and nail polish and
everything so if you want to know where
I got this from with this room then go
to my website you get to Torres dot-com
there's also a link in the description
box below so um yeah thank you guys so
much for watching and um let's go onto
this tutorial
I love you but the first thing we want
to do is apply a base to your list to
prepare your eyes on creasing and I am
going to use my BH Cosmetics eyelid
primer the main power we're using today
is this one from makeup studio and this
palette is Hiller this palette was the
pellet that we used at B Academy as some
of you might know I followed a makeup
school and basically in every single
lesson we use this palette and it is
such an amazing palette you have amazing
colors it's really pigmented and the
best thing is my mom sells the two
direction but the first cars we're going
to use is this orange right here or this
it's not really orange like a Goldy
Orange
it's your darken it a little bit up I'm
taking this makeup studio I shadow and
they have numbers but I don't have a
number on this one but some of you don't
know this I think 80% of my viewers so
now this I have a website and on that
website I post a complete list of
everything I'm wearing so eyeshadows
lips jewelry nail polish everything so
if I ever forget something or don't know
the name of it it's always on my website
so I will put the number of this eye
shadow on my website as well with the
Sigma e25 blending brush I'm going into
those two colors and that is going onto
the outer part of our eyes you really
wanted to start here at the outer corner
and then fading it inwards and you don't
want it to be too harsh at the inside of
the eye so right here you want to keep
it light but here you want the full
intensity now with this too cute Sigma
brush in East 65 a small angle brush
we're going into this brown and this is
one of the most amazing Browns I have in
my collection and with that we're just
making a small eyeliner just follow your
lower lash line
go up um you're not really making the
eyeliner with this yet you just want to
make like a guidance because now we have
that line and now we're going to take a
Mac 217 we're going back into that brown
and from that line you're going to blend
into your crease to darken this look up
and also you want to go onto your lid
and darken that up as well so once I'm
fed on I'm taking Amex 239 and I'm going
into the white and this is an amazing
way because it's shimmery and who
doesn't love shimmery and then it's
going onto the inner corners and then
fade it onto the lip but you want the
intensity on the inner corners if that
is what you're going for I'm going for
it but you don't have to do it this way
okay for the lower lid I'm taking
another one of those super cute brushes
from Sigma this is the e30 and that
white is it going onto the lower inner
part as well alright then with this
Sigma 214 I'm going back into that
orange color and the other color does in
decrease and that's going onto your
bottom lash line now I'm taking this
stargazer angled brush and I'm going
into the black which is an amazing book
it's really pigmented and we're going to
make a killer eyeliner um
eyeliners are really hot like everywhere
it doesn't work with it you don't want
it to be too sharp so go ahead and blend
it here so where the dark part is you
can blend it into the dark part as well
but one but once you reach the like
lighter eyeshadow you want it to be
sharp
now I'm taking a brush like this and I'm
going back into that wine and I'm just
highlighting the underneath of the line
to make it even sharper and it gives a
nice highlight if you want you can apply
some liquid eyeliner on top I'm going to
do a really small line to hide the false
eyelashes and then mascara this is
makeup studio maximum volume and of
course curl the lashes and I'm doing
that with my shoot and Marah eyelash
curler and then poof fake lashes on top
I'm not going to show you because I am a
pain and applying them and plus there
are a gazillion tutorials on YouTube on
how to do that I can't tell you is that
I'm applying red cherry in number one so
on my lips I applied this makeup studio
lipstick in number 61 and it's really
really bright so I guess you can tell
that I didn't put it on like this I just
dabbed it on say get like a little bit
of the color then because even that was
a little bit too bright for me I took a
lip erase by neck and petted that on top
and then for a gloss I added NYX
sweetheart
lip gloss again if I didn't know a name
of the eye shadow or you just forgot
what I said and just please go to my
website it goes east Orioles calm and I
tell you where I got this from this ring
this ring the nail polish
duh I shadow the lipsticks they hurt
such as everything so I'm go to my
website and there is a list with
everything I use
so thank you guys so much for watching
again and hopefully I will see you guys
next time
