two in the videos this month welcome to
the bathroom so we went from my room to
the basement and from the basement to
the bathroom so welcome welcome welcome
so today I am here to do something
completely new and I've never actually
tried this and this is all our first
thing for me as well does give you a bit
of backstory here here in Holland it is
hot it is steaming hot it is so hot that
I don't like heat you guys I I just give
me spring or give me fall and we
actually have a really nice house and we
have a pool and there is this little
story that says that if you're a blonde
and you swim alone in pools your hair
turns green I was actually one to always
say that well that will never happen
because then you have to live into pool
24/7 so as one would do with the pool
and hot weather is swim and you don't
really care about you hair we swim
because god damn it you're swimming
you're getting wet anyways my hair is
fudging green and this is not even like
the total thing I actually try to sort
of rescue the hair a bit didn't work
till Green goddamn it so today I am here
to do a first impression on the Manic
Panic hair color creams and I actually
want to turn my hair back into a nice
lavender lie like a shade again my plan
is and my hopes are going to getting
sort of like a toned down
Perrie Edwards sort of the lilac II
purple color but I'm just happy if the
green is out but like the ends OH
so today I'm going to do a first
impression on the Manic Panic hair color
creams in virgin snow and I have ultra
violet and then also mix conditioner in
because I've read that if you do
conditioner and then the hair color
creams that it's all supposed to be one
sort of like miracle thing it's like so
easy you never have to
- hairdresser again and blow the Lola
and I'm like I want that my condition
I'm going to use is by hace and this is
called the 3 minute miracle deep
conditioner Reconstructor for damaged
hair that's me in a bottle what I'm
going to do is I'm going to throw up
towel around me then I'm going to make
the mixture and then put it in my hair
pull it up then go and take a shower
because people say that taking a shower
to let it work in is good and then into
shower you can rinse it out and
everything so my own I have a serious
hour
oh please let my car have a good score
this week there we go Pawel going as
dark as possible before my mom kills me
let me get a spoon spoon I'm actually
really nervous
okay so conditioner off see bottle
squirt I feel like it needs a lot of
conditioner just not to fudge this thing
I'm going to take Maddie panic vergence
no I actually put this in my hair like
two days ago
to cancel out the green did not work and
therefore the ultraviolet I've heard
that whatever bright color you're
putting in has to be like the teeniest
tiniest amount because if you put too
much in you'll be ruined so I'm just
gonna dip my spoon in it just a teeny
tiny bit and then swirl it in the mix oh
this is gonna be like a purple Shrek
after it's right that is such a bright
color dip it mix it this is the color
after mixing it okay so I did all the
mixing and now I have a whole shitload
of conditioner quite a lot of the virgin
snow and just like one dip scraped off
of ultra violet it looks like Perrie
Edwards on a light summer day here we go
with hairdressers and me we always have
the problem that my top part grabs a lot
of color and my ends almost take nothing
color wise I'm just gonna do my ends
first and then work my way up oh this is
the most attractive video I've ever done
vogue okay I'm just going
i winged it oh my shit okay okay that is
unexpected I'm just going to do it with
my hands because lazy alert I feel like
there is supposed to be more purple in
this okay so that is the first layer
that's purple yes this might actually
work
good more I feel like we're getting
somewhere
releasing the last layer and then
hopefully this will hope it's not the
this is pretty cool it looks really
pretty in caramel scraping out whatever
is left and just trying to get it
everywhere okay so I'm going to let this
sit for I don't know like 20 minutes so
I'm going to put this up in a bun right
now and then take a shower and then
after that once I'm done showering and
everything I'm just going to rinse it
out in the shower as well this girl
but this is the end result ice i I think
I walked around the house for about 20
minutes and then to my shower and this
is the end result it's definitely not
greed anymore so that is the plus I
gotta say that I really like this color
it is definitely more gray than purple
so yes I really do like the outcome it's
definitely different than what I
expected it to be I think next time I
have to put a little bit more of the
ultraviolet in and less of the snow
version other than that I really really
like the outcome I think it pretty good
it's the exact finish that I wanted it
with like the wand and with the color
and then the soft ways in a floral
headband and then just hipster chic so
yeah guys that was my journey towards
the hipster sort of like bohemian Perrie
Edwards purple glow in my hair so this
is how I told my hair from now on I'm
just going to do myself because I kind
of like it and I can't believe so your
difference from what I did and the
hairdresser's I did it so then completes
my first impression on the netic penny
care dyes more color creams slash how to
get like hipster purple hair thank you
