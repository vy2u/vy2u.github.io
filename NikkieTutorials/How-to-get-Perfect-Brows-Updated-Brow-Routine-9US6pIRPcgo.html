how to get the perfect brows and this is
my updated brow routine I think half of
my subscriber count right now has
requested an updated eyebrow routine so
today I am finally here to do it for you
so throughout this video I will show you
all the steps towards getting these
brows right here plus all my brows in my
previous videos for the last couple of
months so that is how I've been doing
them lately this is a way to get perfect
brows in just a couple of easy steps I
do want to mention though that it is a
blazing-hot here in Holland right now
and I am tits deep in sweat I feel like
the amount of sweat I am sweating today
can wash away the entire population of
Holland TMI I know but without any
further ado if you want to know how to
get perfect brows flushed my updated bra
14 then please keep on watching first
and foremost what you definitely will
need is a spoolie and with a spoolie you
can brush your hairs down you can brush
them up you can brush it through you can
do everything with a spoolie basically
not everything what you know what you
will definitely need an eyebrow brush
and I love my Sigma e 75 for this I've
been using this for years it's one of my
all-time favorites it's absolutely
amazing I also do really like the zoeva
320 to the brow line for clean on my
like to use d Mac 212 shout this in a
favorites video recently and to sit at
all I like using my Mac 252 the first
products I'll be using is my brow Wiz by
Anastasia and this is ash blonde it
comes with the pencil side and it comes
with the spoolie it's actually a really
great spoolie because it's really thin
and concentrated so if you like to have
a little bit more control use this one
so what I like to do is brush my brow
hair down and why it's because I really
like having that definition on the top
of my brow and really accentuating that
sort of arch I'm going to do is start
making a line at the top of my eyebrow
to really get that definition
and then once I get to my arch I really
define that now what I like to do is
tilt my head down I really brush that
tail in you can make this as long as you
want but I find a little shorter tail
lifts the face up a little bit more
whereas if you go longer it kind of
drags everything down so once I got that
line I'm going to brush all the hairs
back up you can already tell that after
really accentuating that top your brow
Rd looks so much more defined and fuller
and just prettier and better and Brauer
so then we're going to go back to my
brow Wiz and from that outer part I'm
going to drag it into the bottom in
Reverse because starting at my brow and
working to the tail starting at the
bottom again making a line and
connecting it to the tail then what I
usually do is kind of again flick it to
the inner part of my brow but not all
the way and then I like to go over to
shadows I really like getting that
precise and clean outline with a pencil
but I like the rest of my brows to be a
little bit more soft and a little bit
more hazy and dreamy and Hall so for the
shadows I like taking this eyeshadow by
Mac called coquettes and I also really
like to mix that into the Anastasia brow
powder duo in ash blonde taupe and I
kind of wiggled it all around to get the
perfect color so these three make a
winning combo for blondie so I'm going
to take that Sigma e75 and I'm going to
go into coquettes
and what I'm going to do is fill in
between the lines then I wipe the brush
off and I'm going to swirl my brush into
this Anastasia brow powder duo and
slightly but surely I'm going to work my
way to the front of my brow and I'm
considered to have sort of an ombre brow
and that term has always been thrown at
my face but you know what I like the
hombre Brown so I'm going to take that
lighter color and slowly but surely
flick it into the front really lightly I
really don't like when the front part of
the brow has a really sort of harsh
feeling I just doesn't feel right
and then I go back into Coquette a
slightly darken the inner parts or the
front of the rod a little bit more to
sort of diminish any all brightness then
I go ahead and take that spoolie and
kind of wiggle it in between the lines
to really distribute every single
product applied and make it look nicely
blended then to make the hair stay in
place all day long and to actually lift
the hairs and lift the entire look a
little bit more I'm gonna take my
illamasqua a brow and lash gel this is
one of my all-time favorites because it
just worked like a charm so I'm going to
take that gel and I first going to
concentrate it on the outer part of my
brows the tails and once the product is
on there I again work my way in and
really brush those hairs up so once the
hairs up my brows are completely lifted
and brushed up you can definitely see
that it looks a little bit more natural
because the brows really kind of give
that texture and bring that texture back
in now you can't leave your brows like
this I personally love to clean them up
a little bit more and really go for that
precise look and you guessed it we're
going to do that with a little bit of
concealer and for that I'm using my
studio finish concealer by Mac in nc15
you don't have to use the concealer
trick I know a lot of people hated umm
and a lot of people love it as well I
used to really pack on that concealer
like you have know I used to go for like
the drag brow like no other but nowadays
I only like to clean up my arch with the
concealer and then leave it because I
really like how an arch can be so
precise and lifted and then the rest can
be really soft and hazy so I'm going to
take the 212 by Mac and I'm going to go
into my concealer from back as well and
what I'm going to do is a brush
excess off to the back of my hand so you
don't really have that sort of gunk of
concealer on your brush so I'm going to
do let's just trace that line from
underneath
then whatever I have left I kind of
brushed down and then blend in with my
finger and then what I like to do is
take my brow is one more time and kinda
lengthen my brow chill a tad bit more
then to make sure these bad boys don't
go anywhere throughout the day I'm going
to take a powder this is my hourglass
ambient lighting powder in diffused
light and I'm going to take a little bit
with my Mac 252 and I'm going to set
above the brow because I apply it on my
brow products on top of a wet foundation
I haven't set this entire area yet and I
don't want this to be super shiny so I'm
basically setting the foundation with a
really concentrated brush and then I
lightly tap it over the brow as well and
that guys is how I like to fill in my
brows and how to get the perfect brows
for yourself of course again you can
skip the concealer and go for a somewhat
more natural look but I really like
having that clean art for a fullness of
every single product used and mentioned
