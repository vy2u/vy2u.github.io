lot I got a lot of requests to do a
daily face routine for my face face
routine for my face right I always
wanted to do it but I was like ah
they're gonna hate me for it because I
use so much products but today I'm just
gonna do it because their requests were
coming in like amounts it might seem
like I use a lot of stuff I use a lot of
products but I use minimum amount of the
product itself if you want to know how I
got this skin and what I'm wearing and
all that stuff then please keep on
watching what I personally always start
with is moisturizer and moisturizer is
really essential if you have oily skin
dry skin combination skin you just need
moisturizer because it gives you a nice
even base to work with um the one I
always use is the intensive moisture
balance from Dermalogica and I got this
from the webshop for my mom uh I had
school Smith guys spin to know they're
for foundation I always mix two colors I
take a darker color and I take a lighter
color and that will make my color
because what I believe is that some
people are really lucky when they have
like one bottle of foundation and that's
exactly their color I don't really
believe in that I think you have to get
two colors and mix and match them to
your own skin color and you can't find
your skin color by going to your chest
area people I always see people - well
you have to go to your jawline well you
have to do your hand well you have to do
the inside of your arm no no and no
because one um you want your type if
you're wearing something like this this
is really basic because I'm just filming
today but let's say you're wearing
something like this and you're going out
and it's really hot outside
and you apply foundation that's
measuring right here this is still a
different color people you want this to
be one thing you don't want a head and a
chest you want a chest and
and what it needs to be one even thing
the colors I use are it's from Revlon
and it's the Colorstay foundation it's
my hands-down favorite foundation ever
and this is for combination skin and it
stays on your like face the entire day
it gets a little bit shiny after like
ten hours on your chin and on your nose
and stuff like that but it's really good
it's really good I'm the color 150 buff
which is my darker one and 110 ivory I'm
going to take this Mac lustre drops in
pink rebel and put that into the
foundation mix as well then I'm going to
take my Beauty Blender this is the
sponge I always use for my face I'm over
round for laying around me and then I
just take some of the concealer and I
just start patting it on what you want
to know is that when you pat it on you
really get the pigmentation of your
front seat as eyeshadow if you Pat
eyeshadow on you get the true color if
you like smear it on your like blending
away the pigmentation it's the same with
foundation just Pat it on where you need
it if you want to blend it just smear it
on then for concealer I actually use the
foundation as well um this is Illamasqua
rich liquid foundation this is
hands-down the best high coverage
foundation ever I use it as concealer
and it hides anything just grab some of
that product and just start going under
my eye go under it and then with me I
have dark circles on inner corners of my
eyes as well so I go ahead and grab some
of that as well like that and then just
take a bit more and blend it down for a
highlight on your cheeks then I take my
Beauty Blender again and I just blend
that into my skin and I always set my
concealer immediately with my face run
healing powder and this power
is kind of light reflecting because it
has like a sort of shimmer in it I
really like and I just set my concealer
with it just to come to yellow nothing
else okay so once I've said that
under-eye concealer I just know it's not
going to move any more so I can work
further on to like the cheekbones and
stuff I'm lately I am obsessed with
cream highlighters um think of next
cream color base in Perl
this is orgasmic and then I actually
really like to bronze on my skin with
the cream bronzer this is from Max nua
summer collection and this is a skin
Sheen bronzer stick in ten tint gonna
take my sigma angled top kabuki brush
and I'm just going to take some of that
bronzer and I'm just going to make a
base for my contour already and so I dip
it on the back of my hand and then just
dab it on a bit so you get a nice bronzy
base for your contour already ain't get
really nice and run stop that's what I
like so once I've got that bronzer on as
I told you I love putting on cream
highlighters so today I'm just gonna
take pearl from Mac just a little bit
and just put it on where you see that
shine already you just want to intensify
that I just dabbing it on and dab that
highlight on because if you rub it on
you're moving your foundation and then
you're screwed okay now if you feel like
you have too much shine just take your
Beauty Blender with some residue of the
foundation and just make it less visible
and now I'm going to set the entire
thing with powder and my favorite powder
is the studio care blend from Mac um
it's just look at the pan porn and the
brushes I use for that is the Sigma
powder blush in f10 and then all over it
just a little bit is the Sigma tapered
phase brushing f25 first I'm going to
take that f10 brush go into the powder
and set the most creamy parts of my
face so where I put that highlighter I'm
going to set that first with a really
dense brush so I'm sure that it's locked
into my skin and then all over I'm just
going to take the tapered blending brush
to go all the way into the powder and
set everything really lightly and right
now you can stop and do your brows to
your eyes your lips but because I am NOT
the skinniest girl let's be honest I
always like to contour a little bit more
just to give me more like feeling into
my skin so I always contour with LMSs
powder blush in disobey and then I like
to deepen it up a bit with an X blush in
taupe for contouring I always use two
brushes this is the Sigma SS 168 it has
a new name don't have it
and the Sigma SS 165 has a new name
don't know it and the way you want to
contour is from your jaw line has a
direction and you want to follow that to
your contour and just at the top of your
ear and then make a triangle so first
follow the direction of your jawbone
make a stripe and then make a triangle
go up and that will swing down the face
perfectly and then of course blend it
into your skin then I always like my
trusty Sigma kabuki brush and I just
blend it in even better I'm not really a
blush type of person because I am so
light and I don't like how blush can
look like a clown on me but one I
definitely like it's the sleek blush in
rose gold and it's like a pink blush
with the gold shimmer in it so I always
take a brush like this this is from BH
Cosmetics I just take a little teeny bit
tap it on my hand
and smell really fake Lee I just have
one two pageant contest and then just
put it on those apples of cheeks and
blend it back i won I am so happy so
yeah that is basically how I do my
face routine like every single day when
I wear makeup and I know it might seem
like I use a lot of product and I'm
clogging my pores till they like oh I
just hit some tips and tricks on what I
told you today and hopefully you learn
something and I love you and hopefully I
will see you guys next time
