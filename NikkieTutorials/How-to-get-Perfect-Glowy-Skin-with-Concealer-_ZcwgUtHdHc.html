video that has been requested
so many times ever since I dropped it
here on the channel lately on a daily
basis I've been doing my face with
concealer only after I told you guys you
all wanted a tutorial or a how-to video
on how to actually do that yourself as
well so today I'll be showing you how to
get a flawless face with concealer only
this is a technique that I use on a
daily basis
so yeah if you want to know how to
perfect your face with concealer only
then please keep on watching
okay so first and foremost I want you
guys to know that this is me without
anything on my face uh without I have
moisturizer on and everything but
nothing to cover up any imperfections I
can assure you that not one guru here on
YouTube has the perfect flawless face
we all cover it up we all have our
secrets none of us woke up like this so
what I always do is moisturize my skin
and give it sort of that hydration that
it needs
I already moisturized this morning but I
feel like I need a little bit more and I
want that extra glow so first I'm going
to take my Mac prep and prime natural
radiance in a radiant pink and I love to
stuff it it doesn't really act as a
primer it just adds a lot of moisture
and glow to the face and that is what I
really love I'm gonna take two pumps and
rub it in between my fingers and then
just pamper your skin with this as you
may already have noticed my face is a
lot more red than the rest of my body my
entire body is really light but with a
yellow undertone but my face is really
light with a more pinky red undertone so
what I do is match my face to my body
because I don't want a yellow body and a
pink head and my face gets red really
easily and I always becomes like why are
your ear so red that's because when I
get hot on the lower part of my face and
my ears get extremely red so when you
see me having red ears it's probably
really hot in my room while filming or
I'm just I'm just hot okay so once that
is on I go on to the concealer that I
sort of use as a foundation not really
I'm talking about the Mac Pro Longwear
concealer
in NC 15 this stuff is amazing because
it does increase it stays on like a mofo
so what I do with the pro longwear
concealer is I take two to three pumps
on the back of my hand and then spread
it all over my face and then blend it in
with a damp Beauty Blender so I'm going
to take two of the three pumps and then
with a brush I'm going to spread it over
my face
okay so once that is on you can
definitely see that I have a lot left on
my hand save that for later now take a
damp Beauty Blender and sort of dab this
in and I always do under my eyes first
because I feel like that is the most
important part so the first part I blend
in with my Beauty Blender is underneath
my eyes and then I sort of just go
wherever I want I do always include my
mouth as well um a lot of you hate that
I love it because um when I do my
foundation I sort of wanted to be a
blank canvas and I have really pigmented
lips so when I leave my lips out I sort
of feel like I am a blank canvas with a
splash of red mixed into it already and
I kind of get distracted by that so I
just blank him out okay what I like to
do is dip my Beauty Blender in some of
the concealer that is still left on my
hand and then go into some areas that I
feel like eat more coverage so for me I
mainly have a lot of redness here sort
of at the sides of my mouth and my
jawline so I kind of cover that up a
little bit more okay so once I got that
I sort of got my first layer of coverage
on what I do now is highlight underneath
my eyes to make that a little bit more
healthy I take two concealers I take my
NYX HD photogenic concealer alights and
I also take my nerves radiant creamy
concealer in light one chantilly and I
use the NYX one underneath my eyes and
the NARS one everywhere else on my face
that I want to bring forward and sort of
highlight so the next concealer goes
under my eyes just three simple dot and
then the NARS to sort of bring forward
good features of my face
and then with a beauty blender blend
that in again and actually I will have a
little trick for you after this once I
am done sort of perfecting the concealer
underneath my eyes I immediately set
that with powder because I feel like um
once it's on and once it looks good I
immediately have to lock it in before it
moves or creases or whatever I'm liking
what is underneath my eyes right now I
go in my chanel natural loose powder in
clair 20 and I actually put the powder
on with my Beauty Blender as well so I
take the tip of my Beauty Blender I go
in the Chanel powder I buff it into the
Beauty Blender and set my under eye area
and I feel like once you put the powder
on with a slightly damp Beauty Blender
the powder really locks it in okay now
with the other parts of the Beauty
Blender blend the rest of the concealer
in
okay so what set is blended in I feel
like the face is looking sent tabulous
already but I can still see some spots
peeking through and it is not what I
want and that is where the laura mercier
secret camouflage concealers come in I
use the colors sc1 and sc2 and ever
since I've mentioned them in my January
hits and God knows they've gotten a lot
of questions on how I use these I
definitely feel like this concealer
works best with a brush like this this
is from sadhana lace and it's the 773
and it's a really dense sort of airbrush
brush I just take some of the colors I
don't even feel like I need one
particular color I just mix them all
together and then I just go in my sort
of flaw and I just stipple it on like
that so you're sort of giving your face
and mini massage by just stippling it on
like that and you can just see that the
spots are disappearing like magic
let's take a closer look at this spot
right here I just stipple it on and I
blend that out and it's gone so with
this you're sort of having that light
layer of pro longwear on you have that
light layer of that NYX and NARS
concealer on and then just a little tiny
bit of the secret camouflage and you
just have three really thin layers of
concealer that perfect your skin in a
really thin layer and it feels like
nothing and it just looks perfect
okay I want to get that on I feel like
my skin looks flawless without really
having too much on and I'm just ready
for the rest of my makeup my face is a
nice blank canvas now and it's perfect
so what I now normally would do is do my
brows because I always powder after my
brows to give the products a little bit
of time to sink in a bit and um a little
trick is that when you do your brows
when your face makeup is still damp and
wet the powder really catches on a lot
better so that's a little trick so I'm
gonna go ahead and do my brows now and
then it will be back for powdering okay
so after brows what to do is set my
entire face with powder and my favorite
powder for that is they chanel natural
loose powder in number 20 Claire again I
just add this powder has sort of many
particles of reflecting light making
your skin look fabulous on camera and
real life it just gives you that really
natural glowy finish and I just start at
my forehead and also with powder i dab
and stipple it on because once you smear
the powder on you're kinda moving your
foundation and concealer work and that
will sort of ruin everything you just
did so that is a routine concealer and
powder eyes what I would now do is just
do some contouring and blush and
highlighting and then do my eyes and my
lips just to look a little bit less flat
on camera for the intern that I'm gonna
do my contouring highlighting I'm
washing everything um so I'll be right
back and the guys completes this video

concealer only I hope you enjoyed for a
