general me not looking like Nikki thing
but case you hadn't noticed fYI not
Nikki so might be wondering what's this
crazy pink haired freak show doing on
Nikki tutorial channel this is weird
I don't like Twilight Zone nyan Nikki
actually have teamed up to do a Harry
Potter a house colors themed series
together that makes sense basically what
it is is I'm gonna do right and claw and
Gryffindor and the lovely Nikki is going
to do a Hufflepuff and Slytherin so
these are our first looks mine is of
course by Raven quell look note by the
silver blue and bronze so yeah I hope
that you guys will check out my channel
and check out my Raven claw video I will
formally say that this isn't exactly um
the coolest color combination in the
world I mean silver blue and broad is
not exactly like who but um it's fun
anyway and I hope you guys will check
out my channel if you want to see
Nikki's look which is flipping so wait
aka awesome I'm gonna go ahead and just
turn you over to Nikki now so you can go
ahead and see her look alright I'll see
you guys later bye
oh here's Nikki
now we're going to take max vanilla
eyeshadow and it looks like that and
with a big fluffy brush by Sigma the
2:27 I'm going to go into vanilla and
this is going all over the lid this is
going everywhere brow bone
lid inner corner everywhere
now take a bit of soul our white and
this color is really cool because um it
has a gold Sheen to it so I'm going to
take like two pickups of that and some
more vanilla and that is going over to
brow one area for its own shimmer or
shine rather now to make this a
Hufflepuff look hufflepuff colors are
bright yellow and black so I'm going to
take sugar pills I shadow
in butter cupcake and it's an amazing
neon color it's amazing and I'm gonna
grab a fluffy blending brush the 224 way
Sigma and you just need a little teeny
bit because this color is parented as
hell so I'm going to take that color and
put it on to the inner corners and
get up you only need a little bit just
blend it up see I'm just blending it up
and putting it into the inner corners
and I'll for that chain that I have
going on I'm going to take max golden
lemon penguin and it looks like that and
it's really pretty it's without I'm
going to just a beautiful and pretty at
the same time in and it got pretty and
I'm going to apply that wet to make the
shine extra shiny so I'm going to take
some eye drops and get that on my hand
and then take my 239 by Mac and wet that
brush and then I just got to take some
of the golden lemon pigment onto the
brush check it out and apply it to the
inner corners of the eye and blend it up
as well just follow that yellow you just
placed already
you can always take a little bit of dry
golden lemon and Pat that on top that's
it for the upper lid it's really easy
really quick all is left is the big eye
liner like this let me zoom in that is
all that's left for the big eye liner
but we're doing that as the last step
this tutorial I'm going back right now
we're going to do the lower lid which is
the second color of Hufflepuff black so
I'm going to grab my Urban Decay palette
and it looks like this is really pretty
and it fixed and I'm going to take oil
slick and oil slick is a black color
with a silver glitter so it's kind of
prettier than just black black I'm going
to grab my 214
I stick mop which is this one Arata this
is a 214 and I'm going to get some of
that oil slick and smudge it all over my
lower lash line
don't be afraid for Fallout because this
look is really smudgy and rakesh yellow
teeth now I'm going to take a smaller
angled brush and go further in you want
to be neat with that inner part though
just go in then just take it 217 my neck
and blend it out oh it's so hot in this
room it's because it's like a gazillion
trillion degrees in my room now I'm
going to take that same angle brush and
grab some golden lemon by Mac pigment
wet as well and you're going to guess it
apply this to the inner corners and then
I don't want that to be too too strong
so I'm going to grab a stray doc by um
Urban Decay with oil split together and
blend that right here like that now it's
time for that really dramatic winged
eyeliner it's not really well it is
Wayne and it is the Long's I'm going to
take my stargazer eyeliner brush which
looks like that you can take a sigma one
too but this one is a little bit shorter
and yeah and then I'm going to take
black type fluid line and I'm going to
take a little bit of that
and just line your eyes
go out
and then oh I'm almost dropping stuff
and then just go back in and fill it up
that pie some um corner lashes I'm going
to take a true love again I'm taking the
outer corners of them and apply it into
my outer corners so I'm applying those
and then I will be back forward the lips
so be right back
of course you can wear this look out
with your new lips and go up to the
Harry Potter theme park or you can use
this look as a photo shoot with black
lips so start off with a concealer this
is nc15 by Mac and this is going all
over the lips now line the lips with a
black eyeliner
you have to give this look a little bit
of shine I'm going to get my LSCC lip
tar in tarred and just apply them on top
and now you have a super dramatic black
lip with winged eyeliner and yellow in
the inner corners and that completes the
dramatic look for this Hufflepuff look I
hope you guys liked it um go check out
Korra her look is amazing have you seen
those lashes have you seen those lashes
so I hope you guys liked it let me zoom
you guys in for the end result I really
hope you guys liked it and I will see
you guys next time bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
