decided to do the I heart salt tag the
Iowa fall tag I am SuperDuper excited
about this tag because I love fall well
I don't love everything about fall but I
loved most of it and let's get ready to
question number one what question number
one is what is your favorite fall lip
product a product that I love all year
round is my macca lip erase this is sort
of like a concealer for your lip to kind
of blank out your natural color this is
probably my fourth pot right now I use
it every single day everywhere I go and
they just kind you can see it kind of
blanks out your a lip in a really
natural way so that is something I wear
all year round and even in fall because
I love new lips and fall but what I also
love for fall is red vampy colors I love
those so my favorites for that are the
Mac lip mixes and the OCC lip tars my
favorites aren't max crimson this is the
perfect blue toned red for like fair
people and medium skin tone people this
is perfection in a little - and I love
the new lip tar by OCC called Black
Dahlia this is insane it looks almost
black but once you put this on it
becomes just like dark bright purple
pink it's gorgeous
number two favorite fall nail polish
I've been writing this combo in the last
couple of videos I did and this is the
sort of flaky magic goodness that I was
wearing and I got so many comments on it
like what is that at the base I used
this CH a nail polish in power dressing
and this is sort of a royal dark blue
which I absolutely love on its own as
well but the thing that made it so so
gorgeous in all those videos is this and
foooo
nail polish 51 and foo 51 this is
probably the god of all the flakies it
is purple blue green gold orange red
it's yellow it's amazing it's it's it's
insane and on top of the power dressing
Messier it is gorgeous stunning and
probably my favorite combo ever number
three was my
favorite Starbucks fall drink um well I
always drinks any vanilla lattes at
Starbucks because this just might go to
coffee that I take there and about two
weeks ago I got the apple crumble latte
I loved it but then indie like last sips
sort of like Ice Age once it is like
drinking the salty water and he's like
this is so salty I loved Ice Age 4 to
death it was probably my favorite of all
four it was kind of how I felt like with
mice our bricks apple crumble latte like
in the last couple of sips I went like
it's so sweet and I haven't tried all
the others um so skinny vanilla latte
and maybe the I heard the pumpkin blah
blah blah blah it's good so I got my
driver's license in a car and Starbucks
announced is that like all the big like
train stations so I will probably never
drink Starbucks again which kind of
breaks my heart but I got a car number
four what is my favorite fall candle I'm
gonna be honest with you I'm not really
like a big big candle person I I love it
now and then but if I put a candle on
every night I'm kind of like over it in
like a week but my favorite candles are
by IKEA and these are the the the sort
of like normal candles that smell like
ice cream and cookies and chocolate and
that's basically it I like use up every
now and then to kind of get that amazing
smell they're called Tindra these are
the tinder our candles and I have my
lava lamp which I adore and I always put
that on every night to kind of get into
mode in the mood for question number
five favorite fall scarf or accessory
I feel wearing these earrings for
probably three weeks now and I've been
wearing these rings for probably three
weeks now and this necklace for probably
three weeks now with jewelry and
accessories and scars I kind of once I
find my sort of staple sort of goodness
I kind of tend to stay with it forever
and just kind of don't want to go away
from it so probably what I'm wearing
right now I'm not really a big scarf and
because
they kind of erase my neck and then I
feel like like a necklace monster so no
but if you love this jewelry and
accessories and stuff yeah okay number
six haunted house haunted hayride or
haunted corn maze in Holland we have a
tepee and while it be is sort of this
theme park that is amazing but in the
month of October they have Fright Nights
so every Friday Saturday and Sunday
throughout the month of October
they have Fright Nights so around six
o'clock the monsters come out and all
the kids have to go home and then
monsters go into sort of like the park
and they scare you you have scare zones
where if you walk into the scare zone
you probably know that people are gonna
come after you and scare you last year I
went with my friends and we were walking
through the scare zone and I'm I'm 190
I'm six foot two and a half probably and
those monsters so scare actors they see
me walking by for miles and miles of
ways we walked it to scare zone and this
big sort of like chef with all this
blood over his body and his face and it
was really really fat and he was so
scary he kind of walked behind us then I
was like okay guys we got a walk just
walk come still just relax
then my friend Michael he was like Nick
don't look behind don't look behind this
dude it was this close to me and he was
just like I was so freakin scared and I
was like oh so I just started running
and he started running after us it was
like never but where I was going with
this story is that I've never been into
a haunted house haunted hayride or
haunted corn maze but um if I had to
choose between those three I would
probably go for haunted corn maze how
freaking scary would it be to just walk
through his corn maze and find freaky
people running after you and it's
probably the best night ever in South
Korea
number seven favorite
Halloween movie I am a huge fan of like
horror movies and freaky scary movies
and I love all of that
I watched the possession a couple of
weeks ago that is freakin amazing like
in the last 30 minutes you're like your
jaw drops to the ground of the cinema
you're like oh number eight what is your
favorite candy to eat on Halloween we
don't have Halloween in Holland well we
do have it but like two people in this
entire country celebrate it I just eat
normal candy throughout the entire month
of October and that is probably
something really sweet and chocolatey I
love chocolate a lot of sweetness so
number nine what are you dressing up as
for Halloween again we don't have
Halloween here in Holland so probably
nothing I've been filming a couple of
Halloween tutorials now and I don't know
I'm just I'm not gonna dress up
Christian rattan which is the last one
what is your favorite thing about fall
me and my mom absolutely love it when
the leaves of the trees become a
different colors so we love it when we
see they're becoming red and orange
yellow and they start dribbling off it's
so magical and the colors are so
beautiful and I love that about fall and
I also love sort of the coziness and and
the warmness inside the house because
outside it's darn cold the fall is good
fall it's cold fall is slippery but
inside it's it's good and warm and so
those were my ten answers to the
questions of the I heart fall tech I
hope you enjoyed the Giga so much for
watching follow me on Twitter Instagram
Facebook that all is nikkietutorials I
love you and hopefully I will see you
guys in two days happy beats over bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
