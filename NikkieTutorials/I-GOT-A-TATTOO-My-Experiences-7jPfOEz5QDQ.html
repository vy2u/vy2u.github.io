something to show you the tile already
gave it away but today on the 4th of
October I got my very very first tattoo
I'm over the moon with this I am I've
been wanting this for so super long um
but I never really got around on doing
it
reasons are because I was um I was
nervous I was scared I was like what if
I'm old and wrinkly and I and I don't
like it anymore
but um after a lot of thinking I decided
to get my tattoo you so here are some
pictures of my tattoo
you
it's still bit red and swollen around
the corners of the letters but that's
because it's brand new Anna it has to
heal so this is my tattoo everyone
wanted to know if it hurt for the tattoo
um it didn't hurt as much as I thought
it would be I saw like there's it's
gonna feel like I had a knife once in my
leg
I felt like it's gonna feel like that
because you're gonna get step every
single one centimeter of your skin it
wasn't pleasant and you don't want this
every day but it was doable
of course people have big tattoos we
look at me like you idiot right now
because I only have one line and they
have entire faces or something I can
imagine how much that hurts but um yeah
you have those things for your legs or
your body that pull out hair an epilator
earth to me it kind of felt like ripping
out a lot of hairs at once that is how
the needle fell like it's like I don't
know it just felt like ripping out a lot
of hairs at once imagine getting a wax
and then that wax the moment they pull
it off imagine that for like a longer
period of time the funny thing is that
before I came in than the client for me
which was a dude he got this extreme
artwork on his arm as a slave and it was
really it was so much like oh my god
that's something and they were taking
photos of it and everything and then I
came in it was like well I put a line
with never give up I chose for never
give up because um basically the line
itself says it already in life I learned
to never give up
I learned to always be strong I learned
that whatever happens in life is for a
reason and that you always have to be
strong and never give up never so um I
kinda wanted this tattoo for um if there
are moments in my life where I feel like
I'm done with this I cannot do it
anymore I just have to look at my tattoo
and I can
I will never give up and I can do this
so I got my tattoo a tattoo Reese in
Helmand
that was Dutch that is near ain't OVA
and I'm really really happy on how young
young did my my tattoo and I'm really
happy how a young treated me how he was
really calm and he sketched this entire
thing
I gave directions on what I liked or not
and he came up with this the the font
and everything the only thing that I
added in was like the P the P used to be
really really short and I said make it
longer because did it looks more like I
don't know more artsy fartsy I really
really like it I'm just so happy over
the were like oh my god I finally have
it I just I cannot stop looking at it
it's just I love you so much
question of the video did you have any
tattoos if you have one what do you have
