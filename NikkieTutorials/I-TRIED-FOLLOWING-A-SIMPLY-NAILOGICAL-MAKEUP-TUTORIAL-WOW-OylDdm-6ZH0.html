tell you how excited I am about today's
video listen I talked about this in my
previous video but the gabbie show did a
recreation of Thomas hall Bert's video
recreating someone's makeup - Tom ones
makeup tutorial now again I just want to
take this moment to thank all of you for
choosing me as your your following as
your blank as your inspiration because
it means so much like I see people
getting creative I see people learning
from each other and this is what I but I
feel like the makeup community this is
what it should be about learning from
each other inspiring each other sharing
the love finally for once so today it
only took me 724 years to finally
recreate my own to turn on kitty so
today after 413 years I'm finally
following simply no logical makeup
tutorial now if you're like simply nail
logical that's that's actually that's
very true but Christine the hollow Queen
is not just known for her nail stuff
sometimes she lets her creative juices
flow on her face and I'm here for it so
today I'm gonna be following a simply me
illogical makeup tutorial and if you
don't agree then you don't agree okay
let's do this let me find something okay
simply makeup yes so I'm seeing nail
artist doesn't makeup tutorial no makeup
makeup teach me how to beauty tour when
am I on that hello hallo glitter tears
makeup tutorial cry crying for views
obviously I'm going for that one okay
before we continue I feel like this
should be the one that I'm doing I'm
ready to do something a little bit more
creative and not as like I'm glad we're
doing a smokey eye and I'm a guy we're
blending it out
hello Christine again I mean simply face
logical today beauty community why are
you so sad beautiful so depressing
so I decided today I want sadness on my
face too
so we're gonna do glitter tears but not
just any glitter tears all glitter - yes
I've already put some base on my
face you'll have to go to someone else's
channel for that no what are you
Christine guess I won't be following
Christine for her base because she
really did it ok my face will look a
whole lot different in three two back
hello I am fully aware of the fact that
I might look a little bit crazy and
cakey but that's fine it's part of the
process ok let's continue start off with
some brown and turn that frown upside
down what about a base Christine can I
put on a base okay hold on putting on a
base because Christine I cannot do my
shadows for that base in order for me to
put that frown upside down I need a base
okay taking some brown and turning the
frown upside down
all right hallo Queen I put the brown in
my crease okay so Christine is using the
masquerade by Julius place one of my
all-time favorite palettes and in my
favorite eyeshadow brand and she's
taking this purple right here right up
in that crease where she just applied
the brown which is an interesting choice
because this is a shimmer and I would
never put your as button Never Say Never
but I usually don't put trimmers in my
crease so let's find out how this goes
oh oh my god oh
oh my god oh my god we're doing this oh
my
okay so Christine applies it all the way
on the outer corner and then into the
crease I can do that
Oh okay so noticing that I'm finding it
really hard to blend a shimmer into you
a matte crease but I feel like we're
getting somewhere
just let me try some more okay feeling
pretty positive about this let's
continue pink on the lid
I need instructions I need a pink on the
lid I need a pink pink on the lid okay
for the pink on the lid I'm just gonna
go into the pink from the same Juvia
spice palette
holy smokes
now that is pink colors okay oh okay
okay so Christine is applying the pink
all over the lid but then also into the
inner corner and below it's pink all
over my pink looks way different than
Christine's pink okay so I'm looking at
her face and I see purple in the crease
I see a pink on the lid a very intense
pink on the inner corners and right here
then there's blue here she's a fast
woman and I'm trying to catch up oh my
oh my god she also puts it right there
on that inner tear-duct they're just
applying the blue blue mixin with the
pink it also helped to decide in advance
what level of tier you're going for you
know do you want a boyfriend who dumped
you before prom tears broke your nail
level tears that one's her youtuber
crying about ad revenue tears that's the
one crying real tears I met this guy and
you know as soon as we started talking
about what to do for a dead he said
that's I said maybe we can like go see a
movie and then he was like no I really
like I got setting spray but okay I got
the tears on now I'm going in with a
purple frosty kind of highlight shade
and we're just gonna highlight the tears
oh we want our sadness to glow the world
needs to know how sad we are that's how
you get the views you get the views wow
that actually made it look a little bit
wet okay we're doing litter it is time
to hide all my mistakes like literally
all of this will look pretty in 2.2
seconds yes glitter save the day
you know instead of before I'll say it
again when in doubt add glitter and it
will hide all your mistakes let's create
a cascading hollow glitter radiant
because my teeth change colors what do
you think what do you think pink glitter
coming right up
I have these really big chunks of
glitter that look like iridescent and
like purpley unicorny self let's go to
town and go cry see oh I love this oh my
god oh no I never knew what people
talked about when they said unicorn
tears but now I understand this legit
looks like unicorn tears
these are big aren't they they kind of
look like highlighter in the right
lighting okay Christine what's next so
now I suppose we should put some fake
lashes
oh my god thank god we're doing lashes
I'm gonna trim them because they're
always too long for my tiny eyes
outside okay here we like when did that
happen to where don't tell me that's a
lash in my hair like what is happening
to me okay and I look like a holographic
BAM you look like a holographic wet
dream girl the eyes no ten out of ten
tbh I'm kind of living for this all
right guys what do we think this look is
great for Halloween or wait but what
about the lips she's not gonna do
anything else is she she's not gonna do
anything
christina cannot live with that I am
gonna do something to my lips in my face
and there we have it
do I look like Christine simply no
logical yet please tell me yes because I
feel like I feel horribly yeah there we
have it hello that concludes me
following a simply no logical glitter
hollow tears makeup tutorial and here we
have it we look nothing alike even
though this wasn't necessary
we like a makeup tutorial I did have a
lot of fun trying to catch up with
Christine and try to follow her moves
and like I said it looks nothing like
Christine's but overall I think this is
really fun look this is cool for like a
glitter party no I actually really like
