of the most exciting videos for me to
film ever in my entire existence I have
a huge announcement and if you can look
at the title and if you can look at the
thumbnail a little bit you already know
what's coming so as you know a couple of
years ago I teamed up with fashionista
magazine here in the Netherlands and
from there every month I have my own
beauty column in its magazine so I had a
how-to on how to do the latest trends
and go on and on so a couple of months
ago fashionista contacted me again
because we were running towards the end
of another era so it was time for
something new what you have to know is
that every summer they come out with
their own special so it's an extra
magazine edition and it's about one
subject and ladies a jello and this year
the subject please Irie what the hell so
it's a great honor and privilege to be
announcing that the summer special
efficient ease that magazine here in
Holland is all about me the fashionistas
special make-up by nikkietutorials
so here we got me posing on the cover
doing this and whatever I don't go and
then once you open it up you actually
have a special page that I'll leads
towards an app which I will talk about
later on but I have we got me again and
if we scroll down we got me again
and the more we scroll down the more of
me we see so here are the dates you need
to know the efficient use that magazine
special all about me is in Dutch stores
right now for eight weeks eight weeks so
let's say you're going to a sunny
vacation in about two or three weeks and
you don't have your magazines yet boom
you have this and you have all these how
tos and tricks and Kip tips and just
everything you need to know about makeup
basically what I call this is the beauty
guide the makeup guide because whatever
you want to know it's probably in here
so it is in
starting from June 24th and that was
yesterday so you can get your hands on
this right now but if you're not in
Holland if you're international and you
live outside of Holland there's an app
what you have to do to get ahold of the
app is go to the Apple Store and go
search for makeup by nikkietutorials and
then a little apple pop-up and that's me
my face and then you buy it it's 89 Euro
cents and $99 cents you should know how
much money went into making that app
trust me this is a chance for all my
international viewers who cannot get a
hold of the print version to actually
see this special as well now let's say
you live in Holland but you cannot you
know go to a store or whatever you can
get this online I will put a link down
below in the info box on where you can
order this baby online and it will be
right at your doorstep the next day
probably and I want to thank fashionista
from the bottom of my heart you have no
idea how much this means to me I mean
six years ago I started this channel um
insecure and it's totally not how you
would see me as today just watch my
first video you would know and
throughout these six years I have grown
uh you know self-esteem wise and
looks-wise
and um I've become a whole different
person and um six years ago I would
never ever in my life would have guessed
that there would be a magazine about me
with me on the freakin top and I am so
thankful I am so thankful for this
opportunity for this chance for your
support for your love for your always
believing in me oh god damn it I worked
so hard on this eyeliner this morning so
yeah I want to think of guys so much for
all the support all the love all the
amazing tweets and Facebook messages and
Instagram whatever pet tags I get on a
daily basis you guys mean the
all to me and I'm speechless I can't
wait for you to see this print magazine
or the app or whatever all the info is
on my blog nikkietutorials com
I want to thank you so much from the
bottom of my heart I love you so much
you mean the world and more to me and I
say let's go on to the next huge success
