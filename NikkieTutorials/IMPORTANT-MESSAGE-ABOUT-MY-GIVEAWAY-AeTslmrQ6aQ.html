I'm gonna take the sunglasses off now
because in the last video people were
angry at me for keeping my sunglasses on
while talking to you guys because
somehow that was rude
I'm sorry they're gone okay so today I
wasn't planning on being here on my
Channel today I love the beer every day
but I didn't plan on being here today
reasons I'm being here it's because July
for me is impersonator months so in the
beginning of July
I had an impersonator on Twitter called
round MTV or something and I was in New
York on my holiday and then I found out
about this person like copying my tweets
and my bio and my profile picture and
just trying to be me thank God that
person got banned from Twitter and got
removed so that was like impersonator
number one of July and then like four
days later there was a new impersonator
and that one was called me tutorials
with like the number one somewhere in my
name stay bio Singh profile picture same
tweets and everything and I just like
why but the award for best impersonator
of the month goes to what asshole here
on YouTube that created an account
called new tutorials and then the the
Nicki and then the second eye of my name
is an L there's this impersonator here
on YouTube that has been sending so many
of my subscribers about the giveaway
that thanks London and
that message on YouTube they tell you to
sort of click the link to sort of
confirm that you want to you have to
fill your address and stuffing and
people that is not me this is a scam
this is an impersonator this is not me
and I even a doctor like em I don't know
how many people got contacted but so far
I've seen hundreds of accounts being
scammed getting a message from the scam
account telling them that they won might
give away that the buidlings etc give
away that I uploaded a couple days ago
put it on Twitter of course and then I
saw that they did this to expert edge
they did to Julie and Sam so one more
time if you've got a message looking
like me nikkietutorials telling you that
if one might give away that is not me
because as I stated in my giveaway video
my winners will be announced on my blog
and I will email the winners with my
email account to their email account not
via YouTube so if you got this message
don't click the link inside and if you
have clicked it please don't throw
anything in I don't know what to do
about this I emailed my contacts at
YouTube but it's weekend so they can't
really do anything right now
so I have emailed my YouTube contacts
I'm waiting for them till after the
weekend to do something but for now the
messages that you're getting on YouTube
are not lying you did not clean you did
not it's not me so thank you guys so
much for watching if you still want to
join the giveaway of course you can then
sizzling down below possibility of you
getting an email by this broad as well
is high but as long as you don't look
like the link is nothing is wrong
nothing will happen I don't think if you
click the link that actually something
that's happening as well I think you're
just getting spammed I'm sorry I really
I apologize to all of you this was never
my intention and I hope you guys can
forgive me and I'm really trying to fix
this that was sick
thank you guys so much for watching and
the weather will cool down on Monday so
I keep filming the video then the
tutorial and you so much for watching
and hopefully I love you and hopefully
I'm suggesting same</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
