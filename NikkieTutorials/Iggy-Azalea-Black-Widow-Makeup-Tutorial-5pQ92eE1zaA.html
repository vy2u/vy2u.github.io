collaboration with Shen X o here on
YouTube we're doing a collab on Iggy
azalea's and Rita Ora's Black Widow and
I am so excited that I have found my
Rita I wanted to do a tutorial for this
music video so bad but it could not make
a decision whether I wanted to be Rita
or Iggy so I asked if Shannon wanted to
join me for a collaboration and she said
yes and we kind of decided to Chi was
going to be Rita and I was going to be
Iggy
so definitely don't forget to check out
Shannon's amazing Rita Ora look it is so
super sexy smoking hot I love it so yeah
without any further ado if you want to
know how to get this look right here
then please stay tuned so to start this
look off I'm taking a new favorite this
is my Mac care blend essential oils in
grapefruits and chamomile so I'm just
going to take about 4 drops of that and
apply that to my face it's very early
right now and I feel like my skin needs
a little bit of glow to it because I
look dead I'm going to take the Becca
shimmering skin Perfector in opal and
just take one pump of that and then also
apply that to the face for my foundation
today I'm going to take L'Oreal True
Match in c1 and then I'm buffing this in
using my Sigma f80 brush and give
yourself that flawless face for
concealer I'm going to go with Mac's Pro
Longwear in nc15 go crazy on this bish
and then as always buffing this in using
my Sigma f80 600 so now I'm going to set
this all using a little bit of powder
this is max Studio Fix powder in NW 10
and then I'm going to do brows and one
eye off-camera and then it will be back
first thing I'm doing is
playing a bass to my islets to prevent
the eyeshadow from creasing and I'm
using my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot for
this I'm first going to highlight my eye
using my shaping powder by Mac and
emphasized and I'm just highlighting my
brow bone and inner corners with this
now for the lid I'm going into my Too
Faced chocolate bar and I'm taking the
really soft pinky color and with a
really big soft fluffy brush you just
want to place that on to the lid to get
a soft wash of that color and I love
this touch of pink in the look because
it kind of changes the entire feel of it
it makes it more interesting I am taking
a little bit of kid eyes shadow by Mac
and I'm just a softly defining my crease
with this just because I don't really
have deep set eyes and I do want to have
that illusion and I noticed that Iggy's
eyes aren't the biggest of eyes either
so her makeup artist does this trick as
well therefore the lower lash line I'm
going to take copper plate by Mac and
mix it with a little bit of that kid
eyeshadow and just to give the lower
lash line a little bit more definition
I'm packing copper plate on on the outer
corner here of my lower lash line and
then continuing with kid only I'm going
to drag it further in so you have a dark
concentration of copper plate on the
outer part and kid on the inner part on
my waterline I'm popping a bit of jumbo
pencil by NYX and milk and then just on
the inner corner only I'm packing on a
little bit more of that emphasize to
really open up my eyes for the winged
liner and taking NYC liquid liner in
black and we're just going for a really
soft winged line scoop over it just has
a regular same old line as always but
iced up right in the middle of my lid
and that will keep the inner part of the
ice clean and soft and natural but you
still have that wing going on
for that starting line you kind of want
to aim for the end of your eyebrow and
then I like to go in with a black matte
eyeshadow and really clean a bit edge
and with this you can also really make a
really nice soft flick at the end now
I'm going to do to finish off the look
is apply a little bit of mascara this is
my makeup studio waterproof 3d in extra
black if relations I'm going to go with
the EXO Beauty felines and when you cut
the felines in half you have the
beginning point that flares out to that
really flared out end and you want to
cut it in the middle and then you have
this really nice flared up short you
know natural lash you're just going to
pop it on the outer part of your eye and
then you have this really nice swoop for
cheeks there wasn't a whole lot going on
other than a really nice soft sculpting
and soft blush and soft glow so that's
what we're going for today I first going
to contour style II using my illamasqua
eyeshadow in heroine there for blush I'm
using a little bit of launched away by
Mac and this is just a beautiful soft
peachy color and that is exactly what
you want to go for soft and beachy and
then for my glow today I'm again taking
my Ben Nye Lumiere looks powder in ice
just because this gives the most
stunning a glow of life for lips you
want to go for a classic red and for
that I'm mixing two lip mixes by Mac I'm
using crimson and red and red because it
is a little bit more orange based and a
little bit more bright and crimson for
that nice deepness
and that guy's concludes my Iggy Azalea
Black Widow inspired makeup tutorial /
