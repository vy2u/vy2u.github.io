tutorial right here and this is inspired
by Iggy azalea's change her life music
video this is the look that she's
rocking in sort of the Vegas show where
she's like with a skin-tight suit and it
looks amazing on her and then her eyes
are fan-freakin'-tastic so yeah if you
want to know how to get this change your
life rhinestone look then please keep on
watching the first thing you want to do
is apply an eyeshadow base to your
eyelids to prevent the eyeshadow from
creasing and the one I'm using is my Mac
soft ochre Paint Pot the first eyeshadow
we'll be using is from the Bobbi Brown
rich chocolate palette and I'm gonna
take the lightest shade in the entire
palette and then with a big buffer brush
I just go all over my entire eye so I go
on the lid of the inner corner of the
brow bone the crease everything and then
to give the lid some extra shimmer I'm
gonna take naked pigment by Mac and just
apply that all over the lid and then
also a little bit on the highest point
of the brow and then blending out or the
soft crease I'm gonna take my Bobbi
Brown rich chocolate palette again I'm
gonna use these two colors for this I
first like to map out where I will my
eyeliner to go later on which is in that
direction and then sort of in your
crease draw a little line not too much
though be careful with this part is sort
of wing it out sort of following the
direction of that eyeliner later on so
then you sort of have this line coming
out of your crease and then following
the direction of that eyeliner line and
all you want to do now is thicken it and
make it a little bit more blurry to I
don't know make it look a little bit
more natural and also you want to go a
little bit further in not too much and
the further you go in the less pressure
you use with your brush I'm going to
take another brush and just start
lending the harshness of that line out
okay so when you have something like
this you should be good to go for the
eyeliner I will be using my favorite ICO
liquid metal in black onyx I am loving
this eyeliner like you don't even know
and the shape of the eyeliner you want
to make is sort of a basic winged
eyeliner but just really thick so the
inner corner is thick then towards the
middle it gets thicker and then you make
a sharp nice wing
sort of like this okay quickly taking
the darkest shade of the pellet again
and really closely to the roots with my
lower lashes bring in a little tiny bit
of depth and then to open up the eyes on
my waterline I will be using my Catrice
cosmetics made to stay inside I
highlighter pen and now it's time for
the rhinestones the fun part what you
want to start off with is place one
rhinestone directly on your inner corner
like I did there followed by a gap a
little gap then one two three smaller
ones a thicker one a smaller one again
and then four white ones it's pretty
self-explanatory the only thing you want
to follow is sort of the curve of your
crease and your eyeliner and then all
should be fine
and all you wanna do now is apply some
false lashes these are the ever blinks
lashes a lash whisperer okay for the
cheeks what I already did off camera was
contour a little bit using Illamasqua
eyeshadow in heroine
so really did that Ken try that anymore
I'm sorry to further Bruns up my face I
will be using my Mac bronzer in nude on
board so just take a little bit of that
and just bronze it up change your bronze
for blush i will be using mixes blush in
peach and that's my face highlighter i
will be using NARS albatross
he was wearing multiple lip looks
throughout this entire video so I'm
going to go for my favorite which was
the really sort of it was aligned with a
more brownie pinky tone so for that I
will be using my boldly bare lip pencil
by Mac and the front lip stick it had a
really nice sort of muted pinky touch
with a little bit of baby pink as well
so for that I will be using my Mac pink
Nouveau lipstick and to make it a little
bit lighter I will take wet and wild
think pink lipsticks are out to be max
pink du veau and wet abouts
I think pink
and then we put your favorite crown on
your iggy azalea changed her life music
video inspired makeup tutorial is
completed I absolutely love this look I
think it's going to be perfect for the
holidays for Christmas New Year's Eve
because it's it's it's it's it's a
really classic look but the rhinestones
sort of take it to a next dimension and
it's just amazing I love this I love
