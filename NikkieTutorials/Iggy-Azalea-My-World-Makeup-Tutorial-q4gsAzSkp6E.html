Azalea my world inspired makeup tutorial
a couple of times I got comments from
friends and here on YouTube that I
actually look like her I don't see it
but um I love her style one thing that I
love about Iggy is that she looks so
cute and and innocent and then when she
opens her mouth and she starts rapping
it's like what Plus this video is the
collaboration with destiny godly destiny
got Lea and I decided to do a collab on
sort of the Battle of the azalea's I'm
going to do an Iggy Azalea look
obviously but destiny is going to do an
azalea Banks look
so definitely go ahead and check out
Destiny's channel I love her and she's
so talented and that's it without any
further ado if you want to know how to
get this igneous alien look then please
keep on watching as always the first
thing you want to do for your eyes is
apply a base to your eyelids to prevent
the eyeshadow from creasing and the one
I'm using is my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot
from my Urban Decay Naked 2 palette I
will be taking booty-call and I'm
applying it all over my eyelids for the
outer part of my crease I will be using
teeth so I'm just starting to define my
crease with that and you mainly want to
stay at the outer part of your eye so
don't go all the way in here just stay
mainly here and then you kind of want to
wing it out as well and not really wing
wing wing it but more blend blend blend
it out I'm gonna take a bigger blending
brush and make it even softer and blend
it out
I'm gonna highlight my brow bone using
foxy and I'm also highlighting the inner
part of my eye and making this crease
part straight and then giving my crease
a little bit more definition again with
the same tease color for my inner corner
I will be using foxy again and I'm just
highlighting my tear duct area and then
it's time for eyeliner for eyeliner I
will be using my Mac black truck fluid
line and the brush I'm using is by
design Pro number 22 normally you would
follow the direction of your waterline
and then pull that up and make a wing
but with aggi they kind of went further
out and then back in so it becomes a
more straight eyeliner and I really like
that
and I must say this is a new brush to me
and I love it it is so precise I
absolutely recommend it
for an eyeliner I will be using my Ben
Nye neutralizer cream crayon in light MP
to4 mascara will be just using the usual
and that is of course and I want to
prove 3d X or black mascara by makeup
studio and to separate my lashes a
little bit more the ultimate curl my
mascara dropping it every I can trap
sorry
firm it takes the first kind of contour
a little teeny tiny bit with my NYX
blush in taupe and I'm just gonna
contour because I cannot live without
contouring and then a little teeny tiny
bit on your temples for blushing that he
is next dumb or Dame or Demi or damn
world and I'm just placing that a little
bit higher up on my cheekbones and
blending backwards and for a glowy cheek
highlight I'm gonna use my mac
mineralize skinfinish in lightscapade
yes that's the name and I'm just placing
that here under my eye on the highest
point of my cheek and then sort of blend
it out also bit down my nose and my
Cupid's bow it's enough for the
showstopper of the look of the lips he
was wearing this amazing mixture of like
a deep wine red color and then purple in
the middle and it's absolutely gorgeous
okay so for my outer corners I will be
using this Wet n Wild nine one nine B
lipstick so this is going onto my outer
corners and that is that color right
there men towards the center of my lip I
will be using this lipstick and that is
the wet and wild nine one eight C and
now for the purple touch which goes in
the middle of my lip I'm gonna use a max
of Violeta lipstick and when you blend
them all together you sort of get that
werewolf all lip that she's rocking in
the video so I'm gonna go ahead and do
this all to my lips
violetta trying to all over to give it a
purple glow
and then when you put your studded
leather jacket on you're my world
Iggy Azalea look is completed first full
