the new LMS Katoch Signature Collection
it's the spring collection and I've got
some products here for you that I want
to show you and I want to tell you what
I think about them um but um yes if you
think you're going crazy no you don't I
didn't remove my eyebrows I just I
didn't believe him either I just used
like this like aqua color product from
Kryolan and I kind of like a fake
bleached my eyebrows to see what it
looks like and I kind of like it with
this look who like the high ponytail
smokey eyes nude lips so um yeah and I'm
wearing contacts because the collection
is called toxic nature and I wanted to
look kind of toxic eat so like with the
green piercing eyes and like the new
brows and just smokey eyes so that
explains why I look like this you don't
have to like it you don't have to be a
fan of the no brow look of the green eye
look it's just I wanted to try something
out and I did it and now I want to film
a review so uh let's get started so the
Illamasqua toxic nature collection I'm
gonna start with the new cream pigments
because that is like the eye catcher of
this entire collection is the cream
pigments they are new to illamasqua I
think they are new to like the entire
makeup scene in are pigments but cream
so that actually makes like a creamy
base to make colors pop so you are you
know it's just a cream product so this
is what the packaging looks like it's
just the typical Illamasqua box then for
the actual product it comes in the
typical Illamasqua pigment jars like the
beautiful shape they have I love the
shape like so pretty then you have the
lid and it says Lynette's guy then you
just open it by just removing it and
don't suck at that and this is a dark
grey car this is called mold
and it's like the pigment is amazing I'm
gonna wipe my finger over at three times
color color it's like an amazing product
I'm gonna swatch it for you and that is
mold it's a really deep dark gray color
and the texture of this it's so creamy
so it's creamy but not like oh it's
thought slipping out of my hand I'm are
you're so creamy it's like creamy but
nice to work with creamy also mold is
perfect for like those edgy fashionable
lips like the dark lips this would be
amazing for it and then the next color I
have is hollow hello hello hello hello
hello hello hello hello hello
this one is amazing a really topi ish
skin color kind of darkish skin color
this color is amazing for fair ladies
like me so if you're like albino wide or
even a little bit darker and you always
wanted to have a cream contour shade
hollow hollow an old I had to say that
you had to get like at least one thing
from this collection you would have to
get hollow cream pigment from Illamasqua
because if you are a fair lady like me
this is the perfect contour shade for
your your contour lines then this next
one is called emerge and this is a peach
color and that looks like that it looks
kind of whitish can see it's really
peach what I use emerge for is for my
under eye circles I don't know if you
know but if you put like a peachy or
when you color on your blue dark circles
it will warm it up and then if you put
your normal concealer on top of it it
will like neutralize the blueness of
your of your dark circles and then with
the normal concealer color it blends
into your skin perfectly so I use emerge
to to neutralize my dark circles but you
can always use it as a lip color as a
bright peachy lip color I mean you can
use it as a blush you can just oh this
is depth and it's just a really nice
purpley lilac color that color right
there it's a really bright light creamy
ah fly lucky color in the last color I
have is delirium and it's a rose taupey
color with this I ever really tried it
yet the only thing I know is it's a
really nice color for on the lips if
you're a darker skin tone and it's
perfect for like a natural skin lip but
for me this would be kind of like
contouring a bit just fading it up a bit
so it becomes a little bit of blush
contouring if I want a darker lip color
this is perfect for it and so yeah these
are the colors if I had to say my top
favorite it would be Hollow because that
would be the best contour shape for fair
ladies like me and then right after that
would be emerge then the next thing I
have is this shared lip gloss and it's
called define and it's a really really
hot pink color but as the name says it's
a sheer gloss so it doesn't come out
like this you can build it up to make it
look like that this is what the lip
gloss looks like define so as you can
see if you put a lot on it you can
definitely build it up to become this
color but other than that it will become
this nice really pink Shirish color then
two other favorites of this collection
of me are the nail polishes I received -
this is radium a radium is an amazing
like SuperDuper bright green lime color
oh my god it's like it's like heaven on
earth it kinda has a shimmer in it you
see it right now you see that light
color there
that's shimmer in it then another like
Oh
make nail polish is bacterium and look
at that it's like a taupe ish brownish
color but with a pearlescent silver
sheen into it then the next thing I have
comes in a really luxurious light
packaging it's like this it says
Illamasqua and then you pop it open and
it looks like you're gonna propose to
your makeup brand but no because they've
you're gonna propose you're gonna
propose with two nails these are like
the fake nails you can buy in stores and
like pop onto your nail but these are
really special because they are custom
made by mr. Mike peacock Pocock sorry I
don't actually want to put this on my
nails because I think it's too damn
pretty to put on my nails but this is so
freakin cool and I love illamasqua
Freitas I love Illamasqua for bringing
out something so original and so
beautiful like this I love it so that is
everything I have from the Illamasqua
toxic nature collection must-haves of
this entire collection are definitely
hollow and emerge cream pigments like
these - then from the nail polishes like
bacterium and radium are insanely
beautiful
I must definitely say that this mask a
toxic nature collection is by far my
most favorite collection they ever bring
out it's amazing good quality nice
colors the promo pictures are insane
like in sync with that girl like amazing
and then my favorite is this girl right
here like look at that makeup the one
who did this makeup is more freaking
brilliant person because if you can do
that you can do anything like amazing
promo pictures I am in love with the
promo pictures like look at that
