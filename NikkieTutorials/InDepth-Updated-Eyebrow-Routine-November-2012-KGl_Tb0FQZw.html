updated brow bar on our own so today I'm
going to do an up routed hey guys so
today I'm going to do an updated eyebrow
routine okay I got it right I've been
getting so many requests for this lately
because probably people think they have
changed the technique is sort of still
the same I just changed my products and
my colors but here I am showing you how
I do them nowadays if you like my brows
and you want to know how I do them in
all my videos and all my look then
please keep on watching and um I love
you and enjoy I miss you guys so much so
I really want to enjoy goodbye guys from
bow okay so the first thing I always do
and what I will probably always forever
keep doing is priming my eyebrows I
don't have a lot of eyebrow hair so I
kind of want to prime my eyebrows to
make them stay on the entire day I feel
like they become less shiny and less
sort of fake when you wear a primer
underneath so the primary I always use
is my Too Faced shadow insurance and I
literally take the smallest amount of
product and then I just put it on both
of my fingers and then I brush them
through my brows especially the ends
then I grab a spoolie and first I brush
everything up sort of to distribute the
product everywhere the primer and then
after that I brush everything down then
to define the top of my brows I always
like to use a pencil because I feel like
the neater the top of your eyebrow is
the they're more balanced you look the
more perfect you look the pencil I use
is this impeccable brow pencil by Mac
and this is the blond one and I
literally make a line on top of my brow
and make this as sharp and as clean as
you can
then once you reach your arch slowly go
out and down okay so then you get the
tops of your eyebrows defined now brush
everything up again and now we can
really focus on that lower line that
line underneath your brow so we brush
everything down to focus on the top line
and we brush everything up to focus on
the bottom line I'm now going to scoot
over to my Anastasia brow powder duo in
ash blonde taupe and seriously this is
probably the best brow powder in the
industry I love everything about these I
have them in my kit as well for darker
hair for darker Brown colors I'm gonna
take the taupe side of this brow powder
duo and use that to define the bottom of
my brow for this I used a stargazer
angled brush and I've had this for years
like literally I've had this since I
started using makeup and it's so
synthetic that it kind of sticks the
hairs to each other and that is exactly
what you want because you want a really
nice sharp edge but don't use a knife
all I'm gonna do is fill in that line
underneath my arch certif and then
connect it to the tail of the top then
I'm lightly gonna feather more in
towards the beginning of my brow and you
now really have your top of your brow
defined in your tail now fill this part
in because you now have two lines then
I'm going to take that as blond color
the lightest color of this Anastasia
brow powder duo just follow this line
underneath till the front of your brow
do the same on top sort of even the line
out then take that lightest color and
fill it in and the more you go to the
front of your brow the softer you want
it to be so the last product you're
going to use the way I do my brows
couldn't be more fake however I still
want my brows to look sort of natural
so I'm gonna take my spoolie and I'm
sort of gonna blend this front part out
you will see that once you blend this
from part out it will look so much more
natural just look just go into that
front and sort of brush it out wiggle it
out after that I always like to put my
hairs in place with a brow gel
I used a blonde one this is by Mac and
this is called the brow gel in
sophisticated I just take the tiniest
tiniest amount of this I even scrape
most of it off and then was plat for my
applicator I even dab on a towel and
then I just kind of brush through my
hairs and you see how much product still
comes off on my hairs and just kind of
brush through your brow hairs mainly
d-ends okay now comes my favorite trick
take your spoolie again and brush your
hairs up this will give the most amazing
a lift to your eyes if you're somewhat
older and you feel like your eyes are
sort of droopy or they're sort of
hanging a bit trust me brush them brows
up honey when you brush your brows up
you just get this sort of natural lift
as if your forehead was lifted up it's
amazing it's the number one anti-aging
trick for me now I'm gonna do something
that I know people hate or love I love
it because it makes your eyebrows look
so defined and beautiful I'm gonna
perfect them with a little bit of
concealer this is studio finish
concealer in NC 15 by Mac and I'm just
gonna trace that underneath my brow and
at the sides of my tails and this will
really perfect it and make it look like
perfection this does make your brows
look really sort of sharp so if you want
a more natural feeling skip this so I'm
just gonna start off by defining my arch
and then I'm sort of gonna feather that
in and I'm not going in all the way
because it will make that look really
fake and then I just sort of blend that
down and this will give you a really
nice brow bone highlight take your
finger and blend that in of course you
can stop here but I always feel like I
want to lift this part up a little bit
more as well so I take my brush and I
sort of perfect my tail take your finger
and blend it in
now what often happens with my concealer
trick is that I take away too much of my
tail so I go back into my slanted
synthetic I brush by stargazer what is
wrong with my voice all of a sudden and
then I sort of go back into my tail and
make it long enough again and sort of
perfect again because the concealer is
really creamy I always go on top with a
powder this powder is Valeo le and this
is number 21 and this is the leo le skin
fix powder in oil control I have a full
blog post review on this and I will put
the link below in the info box and all I
do is kind of set that concealer mainly
above my eyebrows I don't really focus
on anything that's on my brow bone
itself because I'm gonna put eyeshadow
on top anyways but when it's really
above my brow I said it and then the
last thing I always do is this Anastasia
brow pen and this is the universal light
shade and it literally is a pen with an
eyebrow sort of shade because I feel
like my tails always need a little bit
more of attention I'm gonna go in with
that pen and darken my tails up a little
bit more just really really lightly and
that guy's just how I like to do my
brows nowadays and sort of in the last
couple of months I want to think I guess
so much for watching it means a lot to
me for a fullness of every single
product use good
site- Torres calm I also post blog post
reviews and swatches and all that other
kind of stuff there and um I don't
really get a lot of Commons on my blog
and I put so much effort and time into
it and I'm like Who am I even do it or
if you would please want to check out my
blog please do so yes thank you guys so
