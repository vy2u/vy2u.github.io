my January hips and God knows and I know
these have been long awaited the
universe stopped me from posting this
earlier so finally I am here today to
show you my favorite products of the
month of January plus mainly the present
but before we start anything I know a
lot of people are nominated for this but
here I go
I got nominated for a shorty award even
though I'm 6 foot 2 I got nominated for
a shorty award and a shorty award is
like the Golden Globes the Oscars and
the Grammys combined into one prize for
social media and I'm nominated for a big
category beauty or grew or something
that has to do with makeup I never get
nominated for stuff like this so when I
saw my name up there I was like
semi-serious on Rudess I am so crazy
honored that I am nominated for this so
if you have some spare time then I have
a link down below and you can vote for
me so many amazing talented people are
nominated so different except there's
not a chance in hell Mo's we're going to
win done but hey if you got some spare
time you can fall for me if you don't
want to vote for me it's cool it's fine
I still love you I still love you what
second thing that has nothing to do with
makeup but is already a huge huge hit of
the month of January I've got some help
done with my lips again in the month of
January after a year of nothing and baby
my doctor a doctor Whitney if you're
watching this girl I love you so much
there is no one like you who just helps
my lipstick just with a little bit of
love but without any further ado let's
go on to my hips of January
alright this first one you can still
come in the Juvia saharan palette this
launched this month okay if you're new
here hi my name is Nikki and Juvia
spliffs
eye shadows are my favorite formula
because they are super duper rich in
pigment they blend like a dream they are
easy to work with they have minimal
fallout they are just the quality is so
magical plus they're super super I don't
know how they do is because less than I
checked pick them
cost a lot of money and their eyeshadows
are chief so there i shadow czar my
absolute favorite so when I saw that
they came out with a brand new palette
this month I was head over heels I was
so excited I love these colors because
there are so many possibilities with
this one you got your neutrals you got
your high-impact humors of like
gorgeousness you got a black you got a
beautiful stunning inner corner
highlight this palace just got it all
it's only $28 let me show you this
goldish greenish color clean finger let
me see a one two three one two the bamas
them but dependent on this palette is
absolutely surreal my favorite eyeshadow
formula and them I really really loved
it next up with something you already
felt coming as well this foundation
combination has been lit these are the
L'Oreal infallible foundations in Pro
glow and total cover you know I like my
high-end makeup but Ivan venturing into
drugstore makeup a lot more because
cannot let's be honest here everyone
loves a good drugstore find and these
two right here oh my gosh ever since I
tried this in the video this month on
the channel I haven't been able to put
this combo down on themselves they're
great but I feel together they're like
this magic act that just worked
beautifully on the skin the pro glow
gives you that healthy shine and glow
from within look while the total cover
gives you that total cover it gives you
that coverage that you want it can be
buildable but it's mostly full coverage
and it just makes your skin look so
phenomenal it just it's like the perfect
mix of coverage and like healthy glow
and I love this it's affordable it's
from the drugstore they have light
enough colors because I am white as
paper and it matches me I'm wearing it
today and love this stuff
a primary that I've been falling in love
with is by Becca this is called the ever
met powerless priming Perfector now this
always scared me away one because so
many people have put negative reviews on
this out there and two I have super dry
skin
and anything mattifying or like
oil-absorbing is like a nightmare
commutes like Freddy Krueger coming to
hug me just primer right here if you put
it on the fingertips rub it in and then
dab it onto your oily parts where your
makeup gets oily the quickest for me
that is Center forehead size of nose
like right and that little crevice top
of nose chin corners of my mouth that is
where I get the oiliest the quickest and
this really helps me fight that I went
to gym beauty from person in my life
ever and I had a meet-and-greet there
with Oprah and I put this on my oily
parts and my skin dabomb all day usually
after like a couple of hours I know it's
time for a touch-up like I need some
powder especially during gym beauty but
then I look into a mirror and I was fine
so this was really helped making my
makeup more lung-lung wearing and it's
just good promise another highlighter
I've been loving is my Laura Geller now
Laura Geller highlighters and I haven't
really been the best of friends because
everyone was talking about gilded honey
I bought gilded honey looks like I
mean it was too dark for me it didn't
really bling on my face so when I saw
this color right here at Ulta I I was
hesitant because I was like if this is
going to treat me like gilded honey
treated me I'm not gonna have a fun
experience so I still went ahead and
bought this and our board in a couple
videos this month and this is so so
pretty
it is called charming pink and it is
like the name it is just H our main pink
it is a very nicely lime and glow but
with 18 touch so it's going to give you
the beautiful radiance but with the pink
touch okay talking about Jen Beauty
earlier I word this lip color to gems
udda one I usually don't ever do this
when you have an important day use
products stick to products that you know
work for you but I was feeling I'm
feeling a little adventurous and wanted
to try new products out so I recently
bought a couple of the Mac liquid
lipsticks they are called retro matte
liquid lip colors and I wore this color
too
Jemm beauty and I was nervous because
liquid lipsticks for me crumble really
fast or they dried my lips out or
whatever it was pretty ballsy you have
to wear this new formula to such an
important big day still did it and oh my
gosh I fell in love I think I'm going to
say it
my favorite formulas and liquid
lipsticks are Oprah but this one right
here by Mac is coming so close this just
stays on your lips so beautifully it
doesn't crack it isn't crumble when the
color fades a little bit it's like a
beautiful gradient so it looks like
we're supposed to be there the formula
on this is just so unreal it lasts for
the longest time you barely need
touch-ups the colors are phenomenal the
pigment is insane and I really really
recommend these I know a couple of new
colors launched recently and I cannot
wait to get my hands on that but this
right here get on it try it go to your
local Mac counter and swatch him because
they're really really nice okay what
else what else the Stila and I know
pretty much every gurus talking about
these right now the magnificent metals
glitter and glow liquid eyeshadows are
holy crackers on a bike someone
photoshopped that for me so I can see
what that looks like these are so insane
like they are so insane we all know that
Cielo has those magnificent metal eyes
basically they never really worked for
me because I would apply ends when they
dried in it will kind of crumble off of
my eyes throughout the day so when I saw
these I was hesitant and especially when
I put them on my snapchat a lot of
people said you're going to love the the
colors and the payoff but once they dry
you're going to crumble and flake off
what the what the I live for this color
right here this is called molten
midnight it's a black with like packed
packed with like so much glitter and
work do you
oh so pretty much I bought these but
then everyone after my snap started
telling me that they flake off and
really just fall off your eyeballs after
a couple minutes once they dry in now
personally I haven't experienced this I
use my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot I will
say though I wore one color to jam
beauty day one because of those tweets I
got a little insecure about the product
so I packed an eyeshadow over top while
the product was still wet and staying on
my eyes all day long I didn't have any
crumbly Nisour falling out or whatever
it sit on perfectly so if you want to be
sure that this stays on all day long
I recommend sending this with a shadow
that is close in color but I've even
worn these without sending them with the
shadow and this day on my lips perfectly
fine for me maybe if you are
experiencing the follow up maybe try a
different primer just look at it done oh
my gosh how could I forget the pure
identity I found out about this product
because of Mac Daddy angel he was
showing this off on snapchat and I was
so intrigued because I have super dry on
your eyes and usually I find my ways
with a concealer and foundation to fight
that then was I going with my baked with
my powder it just i started from that i
like go back to the start it's like back
to zero so when he talked about the pure
identity on his snapchat saying that it
helps his concealer look flawless and
that just made his other eyes look great
I was like okay I'm sold on a try right
now personally for me it has really made
a difference in my makeup application
where my concealer looks more smooth it
just it's my under eyes look more
hydrated and taken care of even when I
bake you know baking is so beautiful and
baking is so nice for keeping that
makeup on but it can make you look older
or drier and to fight that you really
have to moisturize your under eyes and I
find that with the pure identity I mean
I have talked about this milk makeup
sick the cooling water sick and I think
this is great
but this one works better for dehydrated
dry under eyes so that's why I'm not
including this in this video because I
feel like this one does all the work for
this one real quick the elf prep and
hydrate balm stick is awesome for dry
skin at first I was a little bit
skeptical because I felt like you know
how is you know not to be mean but how
is a a cheaper brand like else going to
give me all that moisture and hydration
that I need usually cheaper brands don't
give you that I was so wrong this gives
me all I want plus more it just makes my
skin feel so nourish like I said in
video so it doesn't keep my makeup on
longer or does anything for my pores
it's just pure and soullow hydration and
moisturizing alright if you follow me on
snapchat last product I swear if you
follow me on snapchat you've seen this
mask make some appearances a lot of
times this right here is by Ofra it is
called the Oprah peptide whitening mask
this mask still in my heart the first
time I read it I was a whitening mask
what do you mean it's got bleach in it
no it does not have wheat in it it's not
going to lighten your skin tone but I
more so feel like what it does is when
you have like acne or pimples or a
little breakouts and they have a lot of
redness or you have hyperpigmentation I
believe there is goji after them here
kojic acid and what kojic acid does is
take hyperpigmentation or redness and
kind of deals with it and gets it over
with it's like a quick smooth breakup
when I take this mask off I am left with
smaller looking pores my skin is so so
soft like it feels like velvet I have
less redness in my skin it's just
everything I want in the mask pretty
much is this right here so yeah if you
are not following me on snapchat yet add
me it's sneaky tutorials and you will
see this mask a lot of times I know a
lot of you went out and bought this
because of me on snapchat and it makes
me so happy because I really really
believe in this mask and my skin has
been looking really good with this you
can also use it as a spot treatment
so those were all my products for the
month of January that show my heart and
now let's focus on the products that
were broke myself oh yeah No
all right for my first iPod note of the
month of January I hate to be doing this
because I feel like every guru has been
saying it this month
ah it pains me but I'm sorry I'm another
one urban decay with wit lipsticks
oh it's just so sad because the matte
colors I feel like are pretty decent
they have good color payoff they are
pretty dry now the colors that have a
sheen or a glitter or anything where to
them that makes them non matte skip them
don't even look at them I had trouble
with one of the colors I have a color
right here this is a red with like
sparkles in it I wear this in a tutorial
that haven't gone up yet because I'm
still deciding if I want to move for the
realm you know and at first was like
that we are that's not a lot of
pigmentation once I started working the
products in it started building up on
the inner rim of my mouth and what it
did was it would goop up and it would
become so sticky so crumbly and gritty I
was like what what is going on I have to
apply like four to five layers for it to
become fully fully opaque and then when
I wanted to take it off it wouldn't come
up because it's so waterproof I think
Urban Decay makes really cool awesome
products so it's the use of liquid
lipsticks needles with more love and
girl know my last oh god no of the month
is by it cosmetics if right here is the
it bye-bye makeup three-in-one makeup
melting cleansing balm and when I bought
my Clinique cleansing balm the one that
takes two makeup off beautifully I
hugged weather before one of the girls
at Sephora recommended this to me they
were like tried this out it's cheaper it
pretty much does the same thing and I
think you're going to like this one
better bless her soul but I didn't I
this stuff is oh my god it takes her
makeup off like in a jiffy like it gets
your makeup off so fast I feel like you
take my makeup off but it also takes
away any oils
my skin contained of keeping me
moisturized it like totally strips my
face that's not the worst part the worst
part here is the smell when I first
tried the Clinique balm I was amazed by
how it took my makeup off the smell was
a little bit like sweet I would have to
get used to this
this however don't get used to it you
will never get used to it pretty much
when I think of the movie House of Wax
you know the movie where Paris Hilton
dies what I think of that movie and I
envision a scent like sometimes you like
envisions that like what would this
movie smell like it would smell like
this and this is what I imagine carry
for wax villains smell like so that's it
