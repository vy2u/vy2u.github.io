today I'll be doing my July hits and oh
god knows July has been so stoked so
much fun because I could finally reveal
my two-faced power of makeup collection
with you this Sunday I'll be uploading
another tutorial featuring my power of
makeup collection and I want you in the
comments below to ask me any questions
do you still have so that in Sunday's
video I can explain it all to you and
answer any questions that are left to be
answered and then the following day you
can all order this but yeah other than
that I have some really cool hits other
than that I have some really cool hits
this month and some oh god no so without
any further ado let's go are we like in
the ear yeah alright so my first hit of
the month of course I'm not even going
to talk about this power of makeup
collection by nikkietutorials
which is me in collaboration with Too
Faced this is going to launch August
15th I've literally put my heart and
soul into this palette into this
collection and I've been loving it so
much I've been loving it for like a good
year but now I can actually talk about
it so power of makeup by Too Faced by
Nick is toriel's great I finally turned
into one of those youtubers that can
actually like rave about their own
products in their favorites which was a
lifetime goal of mine and ever knew I
had alright the first hit I have for you
this month is by glam glow now you've
seen we talked about this quite a lot
especially on snapchat which let me know
are you more of these snapchat stories
or Instagram stories personally for me I
really don't like the Instagram stories
it's just like it feels wrong this is a
mmm would you want to call it a
moisturizer slash illuminator slash you
can get the lid off really there we go
no still not this is a moisturizer make
a prepper Sheen illuminator this is this
is amazing I love this for underneath my
foundation and concealer because it just
makes the foundation and concealer blend
in so beautifully and this has a lovely
lovely like golden pinky sheen shine and
what this will do is throughout the day
it will give you like this amazing
luminous glow from within look the best
part about it it smells like a
creamsicle it smells like a summer
creamsicle when you open this pot you're
like I want ice creams I wanted to be
somewhere I'm going to lay out on the
beach and burn if you're Riskin tone
this stuff is amazing I think it works
great for a make a primer it doesn't
really keep it on longer it just makes
the makeup that you put over top really
work nicely and look beautifully so I'm
a huge huge fan next up are the
brand-new Urban Decay all nighter
foundations now foundation to me I
wanted to be like full k-cup or nothing
that's my philosophy give it all or
nothing a couple of days ago I bought a
tinted moisturizer and I wanted to stop
myself in the face because that's just
so not me so this Urban Decay all
nighter foundation is like the most high
coverage beautiful foundation I've ever
encountered in my life
it is super intense but it still looks
like skin a lot of high coverage
foundations are like plastic fantastic
which I love but this is plastic
fantastic skin type edition they come in
a bunch of colors and I like pairing it
most
I like applying it most with my next hit
which is the Tarte Beauty Blender I
don't know the Thar Beauty sponge
I don't know Tarte recently came out
with I guess their own type of beauty
blender and this magician right here is
the tarp one compared to a regular
Beauty Blender is a lot more sturdy and
the sponge itself has a lot more texture
whereas the Beauty Blender is really
smooth really soft and just glides that
foundation over your skin I've never
seen a sponge apply so full coverage as
this one because it doesn't matter what
product you use it just like it just oh
my god so when I'm telling you that I
use my all nighter with the tard Beauty
sponge it just goes on like Photoshop
and it just makes you look absolutely
flaw it just makes you look flawless it
makes you look amazing and ever since
I've been using the sponge on a daily
basis because I just really really like
how it applies my
nation and concealer it is a must it is
a must it is a must now it is a tiny
teeny bit tricky when you have dry skin
I have like this combination skin where
I can have like really good days and
wear any foundation I like but I have my
dryer days where I have like rough
patches on my face then it just looks
just ghosting but with this foundation
you just have to really moisturize
beforehand which clothes are to comes in
for but you just have to make sure that
your moisturize and prepped for your
foundation and your good to go even if
you have dry skin all right next up I
have the Anasazi Beverly Hills a
moonchild glow kit I got sent this a
couple of weeks ago actually in the
beginning of July and I opened this up
and I was floored especially by this
color right here called pink heart this
is what I wanted Pat McGrath her
highlighter to be like the pinky one
this is just life and more I love it so
much it's so ethereal it's so very like
it's so beautiful so basically this
palette is highlighters with a lot of
different colors duochrome
so as you can see right here this one is
more blue this is pink this is green
you've got a true silver we got a like
periwinkle purpley bluish color and blue
moon which is like a lilac blueish
periwinkle um Jake but here comes the
surprise I've been using this a lot as
eyeshadow or like inner corner
highlighters brow bone highlighters lid
colors I've been loving star the silver
one on the inner corners and on the lid
it's maybe it's worth it
Oh fir recently came out with metallic
liquid lipsticks and you know I'm a I'm
a huge huge fan of metallic lips and I
have tried the Milani ones which I am
totally in love with I have tried the
color pub ones which after my video a
lot of people were like that is what
happened with Kylie cosmetics I've also
noticed that you either got a good batch
or you got a bad batch and I'm obviously
one on the the bad ones because I'm
telling you my Miss Holly close to eye
color pop work so when I got the over
metallic lips I was praying to the
glowing gods that these would actually
work and i swatched these on snail
jet they are so insane so they came out
with three colors these are two of them
this one right here is called Monaco and
just mmm hold on oh my god do you see
how pigmented that is and the next one I
really like is at Versailles and
foresight is like a beautiful busy
metallic dream as you can see they are
super pigmented they are creamy they are
easy to work with they are buttery and
these two colors are so unique and
actually when you mix these two together
you get like a beautiful rose gold
uh-huh I've just been really obsessing
over these just metallic lips in general
have been such an obsession of mine and
to see that Oprah actually nailed this
makes me so happy because I love Oprah
and I don't know if I told you but they
are a limited edition so once they're
gone they're gone alright the next
product I want to talk about is by Tom
Ford this is the nude vanilla
lipstick and this is one of the most
gorgeous nude lipsticks I've ever tried
in my life and I know Tom for lipsticks
are like more expensive than a nose job
but they are so incredibly pigmented and
so incredibly nice to wear throughout
the day and they just stay on they look
beautiful they have a beautiful range of
colors but nude vanilla is their
lightest shade and I got this because a
little while ago I was in my Real
Housewives of Beverly Hills craze and
Erika Jayne is on the latest season and
I've been in contact with her makeup
artist and they both told me that new
vanilla is her favorite for like super
nude day so I went out and I ordered it
and it is oh it is so beautiful I
especially another hit here we go oh my
head scum in Paris this month
I feel loving to team this one up with G
waist skinny dip lip topper if you
follow me on snapchat you're going to
get sick of me because I talk about
skinny dip all the freakin time
but skinny dip lip topper by as you wake
as medics is I've been wearing this in
quite some videos lately and especially
Tom for nude vanilla and skinny dip over
top is like the most sexual nude lip
ever so skinny dip is like a a a
champagne gold glistening orgasmic lip
gloss it's not super glossy but it has a
gloss to it
and it just is longer I'm wearing it
over today's lipstick as well it's just
a beautiful gloss it just it makes it so
glam it makes it not you know it is a
beautiful gloss that stays on like a
dream it looks like an orgasm a wet
dream this combination is just a new
lovers dream come true I love it
I've been obsessing over Suicide Squad
I've waited like a good two years of my
life for that movie to come out and I've
seen it twice now it is so good and I
know the critics hated I know some
people hate it but to me Suicide Squad
was so good and Harley Quinn Margot
Robbie uh Jared as the Joker is and I
really want to tell it you know if you
love the music from the movie which I
really did there is a Suicide Squad the
album on Spotify do you know that song
when Harley Quinn jumps down and it's
like a really dramatic music but still
so that song is by Kalani and it's
called gangsta I'm done ever since I did
my full face using only kids makeup
challenge
I used Claire's brushes and one brush
has survived the cut this brush right
here this came in like one of those like
little sets this is a synthetic brush
that has like beautiful like little
flowers on the handle but this is the
best brush for carving up the brows in
my life ever this is like synthetic and
sturdy but like flexible enough to
follow the curve of that brow and I use
this brush to carve up my brows with
concealer and it's literally the best
brush for that so Claire's you did it
and actually talking about Claire's a
little bit more of that eyeliner that I
wore in that video was pretty I thought
it was on point
literally on point this Claire's liquid
liner I bought it for the challenge and
I tried it and it's a really it's a it's
a it's a funny texture because it's
really shiny and like really almost
plastic looking but like the bristles on
this thing can create such a fine like
murdering tip do you see how thin this
eyeliner actually is you can create the
most precise
thin like sharp wing ever with this so
I've been doing my eyeliner like I
usually would and then once I reach like
the flick the that's where my Claire's
liquid liner comes in and I just Salette
the day Claire's is saving the day Clara
says just slaying my life right now all
right so enough love has been spread
today it's time to show you my Oh God
knows oh yeah No
so my first oh god no of the month is
this hourglass brush right here I've
recently received the hourglass vanish
Foundation sticks from there PR and as
you know I always keep it real with you
and they also send me the vanish
foundation brush so I tried that
foundation and I used it with this brush
and I was like oh my god that doesn't
look good at all somehow this brush
lifts product up and like releases it
back again which lets like really are
looking holes in my foundation and I was
like because when I first applied that
stick foundation it felt so creamy and
blendable and beautiful but then once I
started buffing it in with the brush it
just looked like patchy and it had holes
in it and I was like but how I didn't
want to give up on this brush because I
felt like if you come up with a
foundation stick and a brush meant for
it it just it has to work but after I
tried that foundation with a Beauty
Blender or my Tarte sponge it just
looked so much more flawless and I
didn't have the problems with it like
leaving patches or holes in my
foundation so I came to the conclusion
that the hourglass vanish foundation
brush is not a good brush it just know
like it's skips foundation at least
holes it's patchy it's just not doing it
which I'm sorry about but by the end
girl know my last oh god no of the month
is by color blackened car pop so color
pop have the sculpting sticks and this
is their lightest color gummy bear now
when this came in I was so excited
because this is like a concealer
sculpting stick and as you can see it's
super super pigmented it
has amazing coverage and it's actually
really light so when I got this in I was
at oh my god this is going to be amazing
as an under-eye highlighter and
concealer and it looks amazing when you
put it on like this but once you start
buffing it in somehow it loses all
coverage it's so weird
so when you paint it on like that it's
like oh my god this has got to be the
best day of my life coverage for days
but then once you actually start like
buffing it in or blending it out it's
like some particles of cover it's just
gone it's weird it's so weird because it
looks amazing on when you just paint it
on like that we cannot look like an
Instagram video that froze but it's so
weird once you start blending this in
just the coverage is gone it's just gone
like where is it where is it no it's
just a big no and I'm sorry because I
love color pop but no that's it guys
