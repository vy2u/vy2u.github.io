my June hits and of God knows to fun
facts for you number one I feel very
naked I never wear something so
revealing and I'm liking it okay a lot
of skin a lot of skin second thing I do
have oh God knows this month
alright so without any further ado let's
go right on ahead to the first hit of
June alright the first hit of June for
me absolutely was the glam glow gravity
mud mess now I know everyone has been
talking about this I know they're coming
out with a special sonic the hedghog
blue Edition I'm talking about the
silver one I got this back when I was in
LA about three weeks ago and mom I'm in
love this right here is that famous
silver chrome mask that you see on a lot
of gurus and a lot of personalities out
there and this mask is especially made
to lift and tighten the face and maybe I
am 22 but I feel like I've you've had in
my life when I put this on first of all
highlight on fleek your entire face it's
like a chrome silver goodness and
selfies are necessary once you wear this
mask I just feel like this mask really
tightens my pores minimizes the
appearance of my pores and it just
really tightens my face and you feel so
like oh my god I feel great it smells
like a coconut dream I really highly
recommend this one it's so good
and I cannot wait to try the blue
edition one we got along tongue twisters
today my tongue does not want to
cooperate with my words today oh my god
I sound like a dentist
okay done the next product is by artis
and this is their brush cleansing foam
now if you don't know what artis brushes
are this right here the little
showerheads the right looking brushes
that you see all over and I do like
these so I bought the cleansing foam
because I wasn't really sure how to keep
those brushes clean so I was like okay
let's just add it to the basket just in
case you really love them and you don't
know how to clean them so I got this and
literally what this is is a foam look
it's a foam it comes out as foam and
then you take your dirty brush and you
go into foam and kind of wipe it on a
towel and like see how the dirt gets rid
of everything so just keep swirling that
brush keep swirling just keep swirling
just skip swirl and and look absolutely
clean there is no trace of eyeshadow
dirty I shed it any more this cleansing
foam is so good I'd be using it on all
my brushes on the artis brushes I think
this is an amazing cleanser for your
brushes and I highly highly recommend
this next up the so leek solstice
highlighting palette everyone has been
talking about this as well I first got
to know about this from I think it was
mani and I think Mandy got it from
Jacqueline listen when I heard them talk
about this I was like here fried no way
something so affordable can be so
mind-blowing amazing well maybe it is
and I was skeptical about ordering it
because I knew that this color right
here was a creamy one but it wasn't sure
if this color right here was because
let's be honest this color is too dark
for me and I'm not gonna walk around
with lavender cheeks every day so I
wasn't sure if I should get it cuz I
thought this color was creamy as well
but after hearing so many people rave
about this I was like you know what I'm
just gonna order it and see for myself
and it came in and thank God think the
glowing gods this color is a powder and
this color right here has been all over
my face forever this month just the glow
of this is insane I'm wearing the glow
today if you're blinded it's because of
this it's just such an affordable high
quality amazing highlighter palette
comes with one cream shade to really
intensified when you use it as the base
and all others are powdery got a
lavender more bronzy and a really really
light highlighting shade and honestly
you guys I think this is my favorite
product of the year so far some other
affordable products I've been really
really loving are the Milani a more
metallic liquid lipsticks when I tell
you these are metallic they are metallic
I did that liquid lipstick only
challenge makeup challenge where I did
my entire face using only liquid
lipsticks and these were amazing as
eyeshadow as the metallic lip I've been
so obsessed with metallic lips you guys
can you tell so these are my three
favorite colors the first one is
chromatic addict second one is
materialistic and the third one is
automatic touch these are just let me
swatch it for you these are just on
another level what I love most about
these is that they're so pigmented so
easy to work with they stay on like a
dream they're not drying plus they are a
metallic heaven and if you wanna you can
even apply these as an eyeshadow base
underneath a like really shiny color to
really intensify them because they will
stay put I'm obsessed with these
I think Milani really showed other
brands who's boss with these because
these metallics are I think on top of
the metallic liquid lipsticks seen
lately this is like heaven some
eyeliners I've been loving are by
Sephora the Sephora collection and these
are the colorful shadow and liners and
they come in a glitter version matte
version shimmer version a lot of
versions and these are my four favorites
right now first one of course white
these maybe stay put so well the problem
with my eyes is that I can put stuff on
my waterline but for some reason the
product won't really catch or grab on to
the waterline which basically transforms
anything I put in my waterline into a
watery mess so I need something that is
like super super waterproof and hard to
get rid of because my eyes will get rid
of it I will do a swatch this is the
white right here and I'm telling you if
I'm letting this dry I will not get it
off without like really scrubbing my
skin just have to use an oil-based eye
makeup remover and there right off but
once you let them dry they're in there I
also really like the shimmering pink I
think it's so beautiful four on the lid
inner corners the silver is perfect to
highlight inner corners with the Seville
Center off the lid cheekbones you got it
and then this blue one right here is so
bright and intense it will get all the
attention you want so let me quickly get
rid of it before they're set but these
are so amazing I highly highly recommend
them if you have sensitive eyes atwater
if you put anything on the waterline
because these will really stay put okay
what I'm about to talk about are the
artist Couture diamond glow powder now
these have been all over my snapchat
this month cuz they rock my world these
are loose diamond glow powder is created
by Mac Daddy and if you follow me on
snapchat you know what actually let me
just insert a clip here of my snapchat
story where i swatched these warning
wear sunglasses
we'll go through we slash through the
highways summer shadow through the
sunrays and
mmm-hmm I know these diamond glow powder
z' do not play games these are so
amazing I paired them with my sleek
highlighting palette a couple of days
ago so my favorite three colors are gold
digger this is that white gold ish one
that looks amazing on fair skin tones
Illuminati which is a little less dark
as gold digger but still equally as
blinding and amazing and yes not just
because of the name but also because
it's just a beautiful beautiful more
pinky highlighter color I'm obsessed
with these I'm stops I mean these paired
together oh oh baby oh stop oh quickly
before I forget I really want to mention
the benefit total moisture cream this
has been I don't necessarily love this
as my skincare but this applying this
before you do your makeup will really
make the makeup melts into your face
beautifully and just all makeup just
goes on so beautifully onto your face
when you have this on as a moisturizer
before you start doing anything it's not
a primer it won't keep your makeup on
longer but it will just make everything
work so beautifully so a quick mention
goes to this amazing moisturizer by
Benefit another product I feel loving is
by Mac this is their mixing medium
eyeliner and I found out about this
because of Alyssa Ashley here on YouTube
and when I first found out about her I
saw her a peipus as a base for
eyeshadows so she just uses like a Paint
Pot or Urban Decay primer potion as a
base for all over but then after she
applies her crease colors and goes in
with a lid color she applies this first
to really intensify what you put on the
lid plus keep it there so I was super
intrigued by that because I have hooded
eyelids and sometimes my eyeshadows do
like to travel upwards and it looks like
hot mess and sometimes I just feel like
some eyeshadows need a little bit more
help to pop and when I put this on as a
really thin layer underneath my lid
color it really grabs onto it and makes
it pop and almost makes it look kind of
like
talak and chrome and insane so I've been
really liking this to put on my lid
right before I put my lid color on to
really make it pop and keep it there all
day long the only downside with this is
if you use too much the eyeshadow will
crumble and will flake off throughout
the day so make sure you use a very thin
layer but other than that the stuff is
Bob I also quickly wanted to mention
this morphe 12 and B palette I've been
wanting to get this for forever you know
I love my 3500 matte all shimmer
original 35f you got it but I've never
really seen a lot of people talk about
this baby right here and to me this is
like the 3500 on the travel size compact
ready to go so I got this in LA three
weeks ago and I have not been able to
put it down it's like a staple neutral
eye palette that works for so many skin
tones it's got all these amazing colors
they're super suit I mean super
pigmented they're so insanely pigmented
you guys it's insane and for this price
point I think it's amazing that morphe
is able to create such high-quality
pigmented stuff I know I talk about
morphe a lot but I feel like at this
price point they create such amazing
products and this palette too is so
handy for on the go or if you just want
a couple of neutral shades for your
everyday wear and this palettes got you
and just let the pigmentation do the
work for you you barely have to try it's
such a good palette alright so that are
all the products I've been loving for
the month of June and I've had so much
fun playing with it all and falling in
love with it
but there are some products that I
didn't fall in love with oh yeah no my
first oh god no this month goes to the
color pop metallic liquid lipsticks now
this hurts me because I'm such a color
pop fanatic I think color pop makes
amazing products for their price point
they're pigmented and easy to work with
and so affordable so when I saw that
they were coming out with metallic
liquid lipsticks I lost my freakin tips
so they came in yesterday I was super
duper excited to swatch them on snapchat
so I go ahead do my swatch and I'm like
hold up what's going on so the first one
I opened I hope
up and I'm like okay I barely see like
product on top of my applicator so I'm
like okay sure whatever that can happen
would we like honestly I'm putting so
much pressure on this applicator I don't
know what is going on but to me it
almost feels like a mousse shimmer eye
shadow like a shimmery mousse eyeshadow
like in those tubes after six years went
they're completely dried up and unusable
this is what they feel like I'm like I'm
like I almost feel like the applicator
can't pick up the product but then
people told me just whirl and still
nothing is happening so I'm like okay
that's just me that might be a faulty
one let's just try another one so I
opened up another one and watch it's the
same it's so inconsistent in application
it is so dry it's like literally playing
with a dry almost powder like liquid
lipstick I love color pop and I was so
excited because I saw these on their
Instagram and I lost my everything and
then when they came out and I got to
play with them and saw this I was
disappointed and I really hope I almost
feel like the product needs a little bit
more oil maybe to make it more liquidy
and and to give it more coverage but I
don't know I don't create cosmetics I
don't know what the hell I'm talking
about but I feel like there needs to be
something moist in here um so I feel
like holler pop has to work on that and
girl no okay next up is to shock to me
personally because again I was so
freakin excited to try this out I
ordered it myself
was so excited to try it out and it came
in and I was gutted I'm here to talk
about the Pat McGrath skin labs
highlighter in pink I love the gold one
I think the gold one is so much more
interesting than this pink one my
problem with this is it is $78 now of
course it comes with a creamy product to
make it more intense and a brush for $78
I expect this highlighter to burn my
eyes out of course that might be a
little bit biased because I love glow I
love a burning glow that is like hey
I'm here notice me I think it's amazing
as an eyeshadow topper to transform an
eyeshadow it's school on the brow bone
but not for $78 I feel like for $78 I
expected something super buttery and
reflective and just out of this world
and like honestly color pop has
highlighters that look exactly like this
I think it's called monster it looks
exactly the same and is a lot more
affordable so I'm not attacking Pat
McGrath because I think Pat McGrath is
the best makeup artist on planet earth
I'm just not the biggest fan of the pink
highlighter so that's the guys that were
all my hits and oh god nose for the
