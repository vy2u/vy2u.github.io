June hip Santa God knows hips and God
knows God no boy has it been a month
I've done a lot of traveling this month
and whenever I'm traveling it is I go
back to my key products that I know work
for me and venturing out into new
products doesn't really happen because
I'm too scared
can you imagine traveling the world
trying new products that look like
when a global viewer is recognizing you
so without any further ado if you would
like to know what my hips and god knows
are for the month of June first up right
off the bat I got two new piercings and
there's actually quite a bit of a story
to it I got this done at Mariah cash in
New York City and I was so so so excited
with it but what I found out is that the
piercer who did these put too short of a
post on the piercing so my ear is now
swelling up because your ear swells when
you get piercing let alone when you get
two at one it's like 12 cities so my ear
is swollen like crazy but the piercing
posts are too short to allow the slowing
meaning you get more flowing meaning my
ear is eating the back of the piercing
up like it's eating it up it's like
cells from Dragon Ball Z so now for two
days I have been soaking it with
saltwater I've been spraying it with
salt spray I've been cooling it with
potato slices it's been a journey and if
you follow me on snapchat you know that
I'm going through this but I mean beauty
is paid this looks so much fun yes my
ears really red because of it but even
though the piercer didn't really you
know think I am loving the look of it
and hopefully as I keep on soaking and
spraying and cooling it's all going to
go well if not I don't know what to do
with now the first product I want to
talk about is this right here this is
called the j1 jelly packaging okay we go
to long title j1 jelly pack dramatic
firming skin with improved elasticity
and poor smoothing so this right here is
a primer and why do I love to
if you've been watching me for a couple
of years now you know that I want
primers that stick because I feel like
when your primer sticks anything that
you put over top is really going to
cling onto it and stay there all day so
I've always been in love with the Nivea
men aftershave balm then I gradually
went to this right here this is insane
this is my fifth a Paris and it's the
double tensor primer this is so
expensive and I put this in a hit
synagogue nose video earlier on and
people were not having it and that
really sort of opened my eyes because
anything above $100 for a primer is
ridiculous so I went on a hunt to find
something really similar to this because
this is really sticky once you put it on
I wanted to find something super sticky
and something just as strong to keep my
makeup on all day long and in my opinion
this is better than this Plus this is
also a whole lot more affordable
yeah the j1j lepak primer it is super
intensely sticky it is like a glue on
the face and is stickier than anything I
have ever tried in my don't do it I
fallen in love with this I feel like
with this my makeup stays here like a
house this is a must
next up is this foundation right here
this is by the brand Vanessa my rigs
beauty and this is called the vision
cream cover foundation
here's the thing I don't like using it
in and of itself because I feel like
it's too matte and too much usually I
like looking like a constructed wall but
like I don't know so what I've been
doing lately is grabbing my Lancome
teint Idole ultra wear and I love that
one but sometimes believe it or not I
want more coverage than that I know
crazy in the head I can't sit and that's
where it just comes in this is pretty
much my foundation that I mixed with any
other foundation to get it to
construction wall insanely smooth
beautiful coverage that is just what I
personally love I love a full coverage
phase and with this I'm there but with
this I'm extra there so whenever I have
days where I really want to get that
coverage in I
use this right here so if you prefer
full coverage and you prefer a map more
satin very full coverage Foundation
check out these they come in a bunch of
colors and they're amazing for darker
skin as well this highlighter palette is
everything this right here is the BH
spotlight highlights sixth color palette
and I've been absolutely loving this one
now as you know I created my dream
highlighter with Oprah cosmetics called
ever glow so whenever I have a choice I
wear that I created it you know it's
kind of like everything to reflect my
baby I read all the time when I want to
change it up a little bit and try
something else
I always gravitate towards this pH
palette why it is so affordable and the
pigmentation on these is in thing like
these two colors right here are my
all-time favorite go to whenever I'm not
using ever glow these I haven't really
ventured into because I feel like
they're a little bit too dark for me but
they're going to be beautiful on the
inner corner on the lid
it's your darker complexion so I feel
like this is an affordable great
highlighting palette that you absolutely
have to give a try and I feel like not
enough people are talking about this I
mean hello a Teledyne day it is so so
affordable and it's a drinking so why
not try it my favorite tool to apply
highlighters with lately is by Ray
Morris now hear me out because it should
Spencer this is the Raymond's number two
kabuki brush and I don't know what they
did with this but it glides on any
highlighter affordable too expensive so
beautifully so magically it goes on
smooth it really gets out the reflective
pearls it just it blinds you can signal
people on the moon this lays it down
into the skin so beautifully I'm
obsessed the only thing I hate about it
is that it's hella expensive but hear me
out
if there's one brush that you want to
venture out for if there's one brush
that you want to save up for and invest
in this one right here I use morphe
brushes I use Juvia sprays brushes I use
Sigma brushes and
none of those brushes have to feeling
that this one does so I say for all your
eye brushes for all your other face
brushes go for more if you do this place
Sigma go for whatever but if you want
the best highlighting brush on planet
earth give this one a try it is
expensive and I do apologize for that
but I thought it was too good not to
share in this video onto this eyeliner
right here by la / this is called the
architect slim waterproof eyeliner this
right here insane if you've been
following me you know that I would
always go in with like four eyeliners
and my favorite being the Tom Ford
eyeliner pen that was my dream and
everything beyond it and then I would go
in with like a liquid liner to go over
top that has all faded away once I tried
this for the first time this is so much
more black pigmented easy to work with
this eyeliner has such a fine tip it's
literally the nicest eye liner to create
a wing with that is ultra sharp and will
cut all the haters in half but I find
myself not having to go in with a liquid
liner overtop anymore it's so sharp and
precise and my favorite thing this is
why it is a winner to me every eyeliner
out there when I put it on that inner
corner here to hide my lash band at the
end of the day there's black right here
it just smears down I have that with my
Tom Ford I had that with Sisley
eyeliners I have that with all the
eyeliners I've tried before this one it
doesn't this one I create a line on the
inner corners I create a way and it
stays absolutely beautiful and perfect
until I take it off and no bleeding on
the inner corners or transferring this
is a dream when it comes to eyeliner and
I love it I also really want to mention
the lashes that I'm wearing today these
are the lashes that I've been wearing
for two to three weeks now these are an
etude fairy lashes and on the website
they look so intense and scary but it
kind of made me go I want to try you you
scared me when we try you they came in I
tried them on my eyes and I haven't been
able to put any other
on since I love these lashes they are
dramatic and intense or you can still
see my lid poking through with my hooded
eyes it gives me enough darkness and
blackness on the lash line but it still
wispy and flirty so it is a very
dramatic lash don't get me wrong it is
really intense but it's still natural in
a way I mean don't look at me for
natural stuff because you will not find
it here like literally nothing is
natural right now well one thing is
natural which is my Scotland ear and I
think you should absolutely try matte if
you like the look of them and yeah okay
last but not least I never really want
to talk about perfumes because like it's
really hard to explain but this right
here has been in this right here is
called some tall 33 by a la la Bowl so
la la Bow is a perfume brand that mixes
perfumes right in front of your face
when you ask them to like when you want
to buy it
they have testers and you're like I love
that one and then right in front of your
face they start mixing everything and
make it for you so that alone is awesome
also on the label so this is great for
gifts on the label it can say for
whoever you want it for so I bought it
for myself so I said for nikkietutorials
so the bottle the label says we're naked
tutorial so you can put whatever you
want there don't do kinky weird
because like I feel bad for like person
making it for you so don't go like salty
balls please be nice to the people but
this right here has been such an iconic
scent whenever I wear this and go out
which isn't a lot nowadays but like
whenever I go out people smell me and go
holy what is that that is so good I
really don't know any of the notes of it
or any of that but when I have to
describe this I would call it a very
than exotic walk through a mysterious
jungle and I mean two spritzes of this
is way more than enough gets really
intense but look at the dent I made
already I am in love with this so those
were all the hits for the month of June
and definitely let me know sound up in
the comment section down below right now
what your favorites for the month of
June were and now let's go over to my oh
god knows oh yeah no my first oh god no
is for this right here Justin sign X and
it's the white liquid liner and when
you've been watching my videos this
month you know why I think the
pigmentation on this is incredible
I respect and adore Nicks so much but
this one is really missing the mark for
me it is super intense and pigmented and
you can create designs upon designs upon
designs my only problem with this is
once it dries it becomes so drying it
literally becomes so dry that it cracks
and flakes when you use this for
eyeliner you will see cracks in your
liner and throughout the day it will
crack off and fall off and fly away
so do I love the pigmentation absolutely
but does it have any sort of lasting
power no not at all and it makes me sad
because I feel like it's the same with
the vivid bright they all had that
really dry formula that cracks and
they're not really looking for a product
that cracks as soon as it's on because
that's not a good thing so I do find
myself gravitating towards these for
looks but I know that these are for
looks for on camera that I'm only
wearing for like a couple of hours but
when I want something that is
long-lasting and it's going to look
beautiful all throughout the day now
what you're looking for in girl no next
up is a product that has been getting a
lot of love recently but somehow it's
just not working for me and I love the
brand so please don't take this the
wrong way but the beauty bakery flower
setting powder does not work for me
first of all what disappointed me was
when I bought it and it came in it came
in like this and I feel like they could
fill it up a little bit more it looks a
little halfway empty what I like about
the powder is that it is so smooth and
finely milled like it moves so crazy any
other powder is more clumped together
and doesn't really move this is so
finely milled it it moves my issue with
it is and this
a really weird issue this is in the
color translucent I don't think this is
all that translucent because this is
like my skin color the problem I have
with this is when I bake my under eyes
with this it oxidizes any product I'm
wearing it is so weird once I go in with
a damp sponge over my under eye to bacod
it becomes like weird orange a mess and
it just looks really weird that's the
best way I can explain it to you when I
put this on my under eyes I try to bake
with it this color turns into uncle
uncle orange on me
so do I love the texture of the powder
absolutely it looks really smooth and
traceless
underneath but as soon as it touches my
skin it turns orange and I'm not looking
for orange under eyes so that is the
only reason this product isn't working
for me as soon as it hits foundation on
my skin or concealer turns orange and
that is not a good thing to me
that's the guys those were my histone
'got notes for the month of June
