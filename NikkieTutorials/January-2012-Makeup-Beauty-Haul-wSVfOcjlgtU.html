beginning of February haul oh my god so
this is the back with all the stuff I
have a lot of big eyeshadows as you
probably know but I always bought them
into like a single pot form I now have
one drawer which is completely filled
with single eyeshadows and it's annoying
the crap out of me about seven Mac Pro
color palettes these are the empty 15
colors palette where you put your Mac
are shadows in so that means I have two
dupatta everything and then put them in
there but we all know what this is like
these are just some these like the
palette and then when you open it
normally have fifteen colors in it I
don't have that yet because I have two
DePauw everything but I got seven of
those because I think I'm gonna need
like seven I think so it's really bad I
go I got Mac cream Sheen glassed-in boy
bait and I basically got this because of
jean-francois today um I love him I'm
going into New York with him in April
we're going to I miss New York so if
you're going to I miss New York we will
be there um but I always tell him use
this and I love it on him so I wanted it
to and I'm wearing it on my lips right
now I also got the Naked 2 palette by
urban decay I'm so excited about this
one this is the back I'm so excited I
know on Twitter I kind of told everyone
that I didn't really get it and why
would you get naked - if you had naked
one because I didn't really see the
difference I basically bought this just
because I wanted to have it I know there
are a gazillion billion trillion reviews
on this already but if you want my
review on it let me know this is the
Naked 2 palette I like I like I like I
like I also got this blush from Mac this
is called shadowy and I would use this
for contouring on models and even on me
I'm wearing it as a contour right now in
this video so that is shadowy blush I
also bought some false lashes that Mac
these are the numbers 43 and 7 and I
love them
the PR of Mac they send me the nicki
manaj a lipstick
just pretty awesome it's a really it's a
really bright correlate pink it's more
of a Coralie bright color this is great
for spring great for summer um it's just
really bright really nicki minaj i like
as you probably know i do not have a lot
of hair at my eyebrows sides and I
always use powder i always use eyeshadow
for my brows but at the end of the day i
still notice that my ends work fading of
i don't know why i use primer underneath
it just it it will ask but it just looks
fade it in a tutorial from someone else
or on youtube I saw this makeup forever
waterproof eye brow corrector I'm
wearing it on my eyebrows right now this
is number zero which is the lightest
color and a half it is dark it is a dark
color for blondes but I always like
contrasting brows like darker brows and
lighter hair and love that anyways I got
that then makeup studio the brand that
my mom sells in our webshop um designed
like for new mascara two of them not
really my thing but one of them this is
insane I tweeted about it yesterday this
is the makeup studio waterproof 3d
mascara and extra black my eyelashes are
whore they are like it's like Jason from
Friday the 13th came at my lashes and
just cut them all off what it's a
disaster it's a buff I didn't really
expect anything because I opened it and
I looked at the brush and I was like nah
not going to work I didn't expect
anything and seriously I did one coat
and my lashes were so long so volume is
thought volume never in my entire life
have I had such long lashes without fake
eyelashes on them I am in love with it
so far I haven't had any problems with
this mascara yet it's brilliant on my
eyes and I'm kind of scared that some
kind of douchebag ingredient in this
gonna say I'm gonna kill your eyes but I
just hope that that it doesn't irritate
my eyes because if it does it's just
like I will probably I will probably
will be depressed for like weeks I also
got this um this girl and girl uh from a
cruel giardiniera illuminating
iridescent powder and this is I did a
blog post review on this one this is
amazing please go check out the blog
post review for high-definition photos
of it but this is the girl accrual
giardiniera illuminating iridescent
powder the bomb calm because it is
winter my skin is kind of every year
around this time my skin decides to be a
bitch and I get blackheads and I got dry
patches and it's like no I'm not gonna
function so I asked my mom about a
really good cream and she said you
should go a little bit more moisturizing
even more I already used the Dermalogica
intensive moisture balance this is the
Dermalogica super-rich repair this is a
moisturizer for smart management and
treatment of skin aging mom do you think
that wrinkles it comes in a pump like
that um I really see a difference in my
skin already the dry patches are fading
away my skin feels soft again it's not
as tight and just dry and um I just
really like I always kind of use this
already for when I have really dry
patches then my mom was like how did
this to get so empty all of a sudden me
but I absolutely love the Dermalogica
super rich repair moisturizer my mom
sells it as well but it is expensive but
it does do its job these I got this cute
I got this iPhone cases from eBay these
are so cute I will call this Tom and
this is Jerry yesterday I got a package
from sopr
and they have call a star and color star
is a I believe European brand and color
star is having a new collection like
most brands do and it's their
spring/summer collection
the nail polishes are just the bomb like
um I love this blue it's I just want to
smear that all over my hands and this
orange is so summer and the green is
insane as well I really really like that
collection I also have this what is this
called this is the the I cannot even
read that this is some sort of powder

it's really shimmery and this is just
great for uh that glowy skin this is by
Cola star and also they had it yet there
