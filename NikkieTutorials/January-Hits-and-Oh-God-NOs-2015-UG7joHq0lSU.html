very first new hit Synagogue notes for
the year of 2015 welcome to my January
hits oh god knows
I am so stoked about this one in my
opinion we're off to a great start here
with 2015 and just let's share the love
let's share the product love okay so my
favorite first all ultimate hit of the
month of January has been the Too Faced
hangover a replenishing face primer I
got this a couple of weeks ago I've been
wearing it on a daily basis it's amazing
what it does to my face it just it makes
everything that I put on top look really
nourished and replenished and just
really as if it's supposed to be there
I'm not gonna lie I've had plenty a day
where I was like where have you been all
my life I thought that the Mack natural
radiance was everything and more from me
but turns out there's something that is
more to me and that is the Too Faced
hangover primer foundation wise also
this month has been going back to old
love's
I've always been and still am a huge fan
of the face and body foundation by Mac
and I use it on my photo shoots because
it's the only thing I trust around my
models and my clients because it just
works every single time and so someone
left a comment a couple of weeks ago
underneath one of my videos saying hey
Niki have you ever tried face and body
with a Studio sculpt by Mac and I was
like no and I'm gonna try that so I
tried it I absolutely fell in love with
this mixture what this does is the face
and body will give you that glow will
give you that radiance because it's a
water-based foundation that will go
waterproof so it will stay on the entire
day and then stereoscope comes in for
the coverage so together this creates a
super covering ultimate flawless finish
face I love this combo so much I just
had to share that with you so thank you
subscriber I don't remember her name but
thank you for letting us know and just
calm down a little bit it was you next I
want to talk about a blush that I've
talked about last month but I've created
an obsession for the
flush right here this is Milan EES
luminoso baked blush I can't stop using
this it's with whatever look I'm wearing
I'm like great lumineuse oh it's like
dark black smokey eyes with black lips
and just I'm like great Luminoso if I'm
just ringing like feathery lashes in a
soft lip I'm like great luminoso goes
perfect with it whatever comes to mind
I'm like Oh luminoso it's cheap its
structure it's amazing it's it gets the
glow it makes you look as if you're
glowing from within it's this blush is
everything in my life right now oh this
I've been obsessing over this is the NYX
jumbo eye pencil in cottage cheese I
don't know why such a clever brand as
NYX would ever call their one of their
most pretty products they have cottage
cheese this product does not remind of
cottage cheese in the slightest bit NYX
I volunteer as a name tribute if you
would like to rename cottage cheese -
naked tutorials I'd totally be open for
that cottage cheese by NYX is a jumbo
eye pencil and it has a lovely silver
shimmer and what it is so perfect about
this is that I am very fair skin toned
and I find that a lot of fair-skinned
people cannot find a highlighter that
reflects enough on us because it is just
the same color as our skin tone it's
such an amazing illuminating pencil that
it just it just radiates and I'm wearing
it on my inner corners today and it just
highlights and gives that pop whereas
with other eyeshadows I was like it's
not really doing much because it's
blending into my face you can even use
this on your skin if you want like that
super ultra high glow on your face it's
amazing
also again very affordable it's a great
pencil and I recommend it to every fair
skin tone person out there I've also
been obsessing with the melt dark matter
eyes shadow stack I've talked about this
in my haul lately but this is so nifty
it comes in a magnetized sort of stack
so on the bottom we find the black
eyeshadow which is dark matter on top of
that we find enigma which is a beautiful
dark red on top of that we have unseen
and then we have
and blurr is meant to sort of your
eraser you can blur shadows out with
this it's great for a transition shade
it's great for blurring things out
they're all matte shades but so
SuperDuper pigmented like the black is
black I mean black the red enigma is red
like well it's not like a red it's like
a dark brown red but can we see that
pigment right there look at the pigment
look at that pigment look at it I'm just
so amazed by the set and I think that is
a great staple for everyone's collection
and if you love those warmer tones for
on your eyes this is your this is your
 some other eyeshadows I've been
loving are from these zueva smoky
eyeshadow palettes I have to flying
around for a quite some time now
but I've never really you know
gravitated towards it and then one day I
was just like I want to try a new makeup
today and I grabbed this and this
palette is so good it's got a great
highlighting shade which is actually
light enough for me for fair-skinned
people it's got a great gray it's kind
of pure color it's got a brown it's got
a green it's got a black it's got a
brown it's kind of purple it's kind of
warm brown and it's got sort of this
rosy dusty dusty rosy Brown this palette
is the bomb it's basically mostly all
matte shades this color right here and
this color right here are satiny with a
soft shimmer to it but I love mattes and
this is one of those palettes that you
can just toss in your collection and
whenever you are in need of a good matte
brown black gray highlighting color it's
in here it's great palette I really
highly recommend it next I really want
to talk about the Anastasia Beverly
Hills liquid lipsticks I already told
you guys in my hall that these will end
up in this video ed here because these
are so so so so good they're super duper
pigmented they come in a bunch of color
I have noticed though that after wearing
it for a couple of weeks that milkshake
which was first my all-time favorite
go-to shade leaves this sort of rim of
white gunk on the inner rim of your lip
it makes it kind of look like
a man had fun and then it's mostly with
the nude colors I only notice it a lot
with milkshake and a little tiny bit
with pure Hollywood other than that
great quality so freakin pigmented I
love the colors and it's I'm an honest
sizeable heels liquid lipstick hoarder I
love them another lip product I've been
loving is from Mac and this is a shocker
because I did a full blog post review on
this the Mac Viva Glam my waist I reset
it might review in my blog post review I
told everyone that I was in love with
the lipstick I didn't really like the
lip gloss because I wanted it to be a
little bit more pigmented and turns out
that I've been loving the lip gloss at
the most because I'm wearing it today on
my lips this is the Mac Viva Glam Miley
Cyrus lip glass I dig this one so much
it just adds a little hint of pink to a
new lip as you can see right here it
makes it look very juicy and it just
gives you that very plumped volumize lip
look I I really like this one and turns
out that I like it more than the
lipstick and if you want the full blog
post review on this then go to my blog
tutorials calm but great gray color
really really liked it then the last hit
of this month was a brush and this is
from makeup studio and this is the so1
and I've been looking for a bigger brush
to really easily apply my bronzer and
blush with you just place it on your
contour line and as you can see it just
kind of spreads out like that and it
just bronzes up your face so quickly
normally I would just use a regular
sized blush brush and I would blend away
for hours and with this because it's so
big you actually just have to do a
couple of swirls with the bronzer and
you just bronze up your face in no time
I love this brush so much it's great for
powdering the face also I have to eye
one for bronzer one for powdering the
face it's a great brush I love this
brush and it's great brush so that's it
for all my hits for the month of January
and without any further ado let's go on
to the oh god no oh yeah
ah no so my one and only oh god no this
month is something that you've been
asking me a lot for I mentioned it very
briefly in a tutorial and I kinda kind
of told you guys that I wasn't so sure
about it now I'm definitely not happy
with it my oh god no this month is the
NARS eda brush I've been wanting this
brush for I think about three years now
I almost bought it in San Francisco last
year didn't do it don't know why I
always regretted and then a couple of
weeks ago actually about a month now I
was like I'm gonna order it so I ordered
the nards eater brush and I received it
and I expected it to do great things for
my face for my contour for everything
where I placed it and it it didn't live
up to the expectations I love a strong
contour but I feel like this makes my
contour too stripy too stark to uncle
Yusuf with the face so after I found out
that I was a really a fan of it for
contouring my cheeks I was like okay I'm
gonna do a jawbone with it really really
stark really it's like hey your
beautifully blended here what's going on
there so then it was like okay this
brush gives the ultimate definition why
not use it for nose contouring and turns
out that it's basically way too big for
those because whenever I would contour
my nose with this one I would look like
Squidward from SpongeBob so the verdict
after wanting this for three years
do not get it it's not worth the buck
it's not I believe this was $54 it's not
worth it
you don't need it you're better off
getting the Mac 163 which is what I use
to contour with it's this is heaven this
is hell and that's it guys that
