hits and God knows in vietze videos I
share with you my favorite products of
the month you guys know this but I just
wanted to let you know if you're new
here and without any further ado let's
go so January has been it has been good
I went to New York to meet up with Tarte
to reveal their new highlighter palette
and then I'll also fill my videos with
miss fame and then after we flew
straight to London where I had food
poisoning first which is the no God no
spend a lot of time thinking on the
toilet and came up with some great ideas
for the next couple of weeks so yay for
food poisoning overall it's just been
such an amazing month and I just covered
a lot of new amazing products because of
miss fame I'm telling you miss fame
Curtis is doing a makeup tour throughout
the entire States and I if you're in the
States and you're near to a class he's
doing I highly highly highly recommend
you going we only filled those two
videos in New York but I learned so much
new trickery and tips and just ways of
changing a face and so many amazing new
products and a lot of them actually
ended up in my hit list this month so if
you're near to a class he's doing I
highly recommend you going I'll put a
link down below on where you can find
more info and where he's going but if
you're in the neighborhood and you have
the budget go it's gonna be so so so
worth it so without any further ado
let's just go right ahead and jump into
my hits of January it's so the first
products I want to talk about is by okay
I do not know how to pronounce this look
see ton blocks of tan laka Taney la
cucina
this brand right here and this is the oh
there's more French this is their low
fluid de Morton via logic essential
water sorry for murdering your ears this
got recommended to me by a follower in
the comments section after doing my
skincare video so in the comments of my
skincare video someone recommended this
to me the day after we went to the
airport
in the stores I saw they had it so I was
like you know on I'm just gonna take it
with me to New York and let's see how it
does so I put on my makeup in New York
and that night I took it off with my
routine that you can see in that video
and I used this as much it's a toner I
don't think I acknowledge that but it's
a toner and the follower who recommend
that this to me told me that it really
strips down any dirt from your pores and
that's exactly what I need because cake
face so I use it and it really did clean
up my face so much more there was still
so much dirt on the cotton pad which
always makes me feel good because you
know it's gone
I felt fresh snatched and just clean
I've been using it ever since then and
it's amazing next kinker products I want
to talk about are by dr. Brandt I was
watching Manny on snapchat and he was
talking about this because he used it he
was talking about the dr. Brandt pore
dermabrasion pore perfecting exfoliator
and this is a scrub a face scrub and the
beads in this are so so tiny and fine
that it really mimics a micro
dermabrasion so many said in a snapchat
that it really minimizes the appearance
of pores and I'm all about that I want
that plastic I want I want jeffree star
skin cuz plastic and then I also saw
they had the dr. Brandt pores no more
vacuum cleaner mask and I was like okay
so if we got a scrub we need a mask to
you know get the whole shebang I told
this in my skincare video but when I am
on the long flight my pores just can
walk in you're like open house I
scrubbed my face first and then just
kind of dip my thing and put this mask
on after and it just really made such a
big difference in my pores and any like
little breakouts they turned out to be
less red after so I was like okay this
is good I'm gonna try this out more and
I've been using this do every week like
once a week or whenever I just feel when
my pores needed and it's so good it
looks so good and yeah I just really
really like this duo I highly recommend
it and you can get it supporter I never
tell people that but okay okay next up
foundation I've been really
really really impressed by the Marc
Jacobs remarkable full cover foundation
of course it has the word full cover in
it my makeup game has been a little bit
of a struggle because I'm trying to do
this more natural glam and just I can't
do it today I wanted to do natural glam
and this came out I look like a
drag queen whenever this makeup near me
I want it all on my face and so I do I
tried this I think early January late
December and I remember the first time
trying it on camera it really gave me
that coverage like covered anything and
that worked slightly addictive because
it has even more coverage than the ultra
HD sticks by Makeup Forever and
basically when I put these foundations
on I always do a mix because um ivory
light is too light and ivories too dark
so I do a mix of the two whenever I put
this on my face look beat my face looks
snatched my face looks like it's in
place I'm wearing it today it's it looks
very good it's like so quick because the
full coverage is so intense so you only
need the tiniest tiniest bit and with a
damp Beauty Blender you just bounce it
in and it's like perfection in just a
couple of minutes because it just you
only need a couple of bounces and you're
like bounced and I know luster Lux did a
great in-depth review here on YouTube so
I highly recommend you checking that
video out to say go check out Katie's
video but I really really love these
they're a strong contender for my makeup
red for our ultra HD Stix
next up I got this in New York as well
because of miss fame Curtis so he
mentioned that whenever you have a
concealer and it's not light enough cuz
I'm I'm white I'm translucent you can
get like you can see right through me
when I meant the Sun Browns don't really
come up with concealers that are light
enough let alone stand foundations but
you know sometimes we're lucky so he
recommended me getting the Kryolan TV
paint stick in zero zero zero is white
zero zero is off-white
healthier light I am and it looks like
this and what I do with this is I mix it
with any concealer that needs a little
bit more coverage and lightness it's a
stick but I scrape a little bit out from
the top I've been using it every day
ever since I got it because it's so
addictive to finally be able to
highlight my face with concealer you
know I can finally join the group of
girls on Instagram even like super light
under eyes never knew I wanted that in
life but apparently I do because it
feels addictive to go light for once
okay next is a powder that Kurtis also
used on me this is the NARS soft velvet
loose powder in snow and again I'm so
lucky with NARS because they created a
powder that is light enough for
translucent people like me that steal
highlights I talked about this on
snapchat as well and my snapchat is
thinking tutorials if you want to follow
me I've fallen in love with this powder
for baking I will put my foundation and
concealer on and then right after with
my Beauty Blender I pick up a little bit
of this powder and bake underneath my
eyes and just mmm it just makes it look
so good it just looks highlighted and
set and it won't crease and it's just so
good that NARS created a powder that is
light enough for super super light
people so once again that is soft velvet
loose powder in snow and I used this to
bake I have a lot of favorites this
month mm-hmm okay next up I don't even
know if this is out I don't want to get
sued but this is by tarte it's an
eyeliner but i'm i don't think it's out
yet so i'm not gonna talk about it yet
i'm gonna talk about it next month to be
sure makeup forever created these
awesome diamond powders and they're like
a really really fine glitter and um
curtis music color on me the color I
have on my lids today after that I
became pretty much obsessed because it
just looks so damn good so I made it a
mission to get every color in New York
and out of all the colors I got which
are all of them I have three favorites
the one that is on my lid right here
that is number 11 and then these two
right here
one is a silvery white
that is number one and lastly also
number 13 which is like a a baby bright
pink it's weird how a baby pink can be
so bright and some is it's it's gorgeous
I've also gotten a lot of amazing
glitters my makeup forever but I've yet
to try them but I just want to quickly
show this one oh I think I'm about to
have a heart attack it's like a mission
to go through these Oh Cosette brushes
my two favorites are the S 185 and it's
just a really small tapered and amazing
this is the brush you will use too if
you have a cut crease this is perfect
you softly blend it out with it's like
concentrated enough to have precision
but it's like big enough to fluff it out
it's amazing it's pure magic this brush
and then I also really really love the D
230 it's very thin but not thin enough
where you can do tight lining with it
but like a little bit bigger where you
can like really buff in a color on the
lower lash line this is also perfect to
define a cut crease with it's again
precise and small enough to have that
control and precision but it's big
enough to work around so these two right
here are my absolute favorite my Cosette
if you're getting any of the Cosette
brushes these two are a must and
especially this one especially this one
right here it's so good my favorite lip
products of the month have been by Oprah
hey Kathleen wives heart I got
introduced to this brand of course by
Kathleen lights here on YouTube because
of her amazing collaborations with Oprah
and I'm actually wearing one today on my
lips today is Bel Air and that creates a
bridge for me to tell you how much I
love this color it's nude but it has a
kick and the formula of these liquid
lipsticks are so amazing their own like
any other liquid lipstick I have tried
in the past with most liquid lipsticks
they feel very wet and very and
especially the color pop ones can get
really liquidy and then they on the lips
they dry and I feel like with Oprah the
and formula is more velvety almost
mousse type like there's just such a
pleasure to have on your lips and the
colors are so great they smell like an
absolute candy and I do have a couple of
favorite shades by them so the one I'm
wearing is they'll they are already told
you I love that I am obsessed with the
color queens this is actually going to
be my color for eight like smoldering
sexy Valentine's Day look so with like
full dark lips I love Queens so much
it's so good and lastly I really like
Panama because it's a typical Nikki
bride Crowley pink color and again the
formula is so amazing and just Oprah
knows what's up and off robo's also kind
enough to hook my followers up with a
discount code and that discount code
goes as follows
it's a 30% off and the Cofer that is
Nicki last but not least I want to share
with you my favorite lashes of the month
and my favorite lash by far this month
has been Farah by Hooda Beauty these
just do it for me they are the perfect
wispy Ness perfect length perfect just
perfect when I put these lashes on I
feel like such a queen when I wear these
lashes I feel so good about myself and
like look at my eyes look at my eyes are
you looking at up see how Farrah by
hooda Beauty are by far my favorite
hooda Beauty lashes I'm sad those lashes
have been sabar I'm also really loving
the elcome 300 T lashes I'm not 100%
sure but I think El Cajon does online
shopping which if they do get the 300 T
ones cuz they a fluffy they fluffy and
nice and that's it oh my gosh I can't
believe we made it through I have so
much more favorites but it's just too
much to talk about so I'll probably lift
into February
see if that concludes my list of
favorites of this month I am so sad to
inform you that I'm such a I'm a happy
dork
