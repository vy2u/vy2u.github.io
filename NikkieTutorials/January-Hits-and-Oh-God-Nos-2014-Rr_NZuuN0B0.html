that hand that's really not nice
I suck hey guys so today I am here to
bring you my January hits synagogue
knows it is January the first month of
2014 has been dealt with it is over
Jennifer it was good as you know I lost
my agency and great things are about to
happen I've been doing a lot of shoots
I've been doing a lot of other Pro
makeup artists hair artist stuff some of
you wondered if I by leaving my old
agency also quit doing the pro makeup
and pro hair stuff no I did not I just I
I'm just working more than ever I'm
doing more shoots and shows than ever
and it's been amazing and so I'm good
I'm totally fine I'm not quitting my
professional makeup and hair artist life
never ever I am really looking forward
to this video because where other months
I barely came up with ten hits today I
think I have 20 the first hit for this
month is by Mac and this is from the
prep and prime line and this is called
natural radiance what this is is sort of
a base slash moisturizer that you put on
before concealer and foundation and this
is the natural radiance illuminating
base in radiant pink this is definitely
not a primer does not make your
foundation stay on longer or make it
last longer it's none of that I find it
more Sippy a good sort of base to start
your entire routine with what I do with
this is I put two pumps over my entire
face and it just makes the skin really
moist and dewy this has definitely made
my foundation routine a lot easier
because it just it adds that sort of
nice moisty feeling such as i hate that
word' it makes your skin feel hydrated
and and ready to be glammed up with it's
just perfect to kind of start your
routine with I've been really liking
this I think like a month or so ago I
completely changed up my foundation
routine I do not use any foundation
anymore all I do is
you concealer I use a lot of concealer
but I just use concealer I don't do for
nation anymore so what I used to do was
a lot of foundation a lot of concealer
and powder and I kind of skipped the
entire Foundation part now and just do a
lot of concealer so I've been trying a
lot of new products to sort of come up
with something new and try new stuff
that because I I was in a rut
I was just same routine every day until
I was getting so boring and I wanted
something else I wanted to try new
products and new stuff and for a month
or so I tried this and oh it's so good
it's so great so amazing the first
concealer I've been really loving and
have had this for a long while now this
is NYX HD photogenic concealer
and lights I really like this concealer
its pigmented its Stewie you blend it
out like a dream it just looks good on
the skin it doesn't cake up it's a
really good concealer and the best part
of it is that it is so Chetan but I have
been using this for quite a while now to
highlight my face and sort of do a light
contouring I wanted to try something new
and I've heard lots of great things
about the NARS radiant creamy concealer
so I ordered one for myself as well this
is number light one and it's called
Chantilly and hope I get the hive if
these two were brothers and Nixon and
ours won the NYX would be a younger sort
of a little bit less experienced part of
the family and NARS would be like like
the grandpa with all the knowledge it
had more sort of life lessons my
descriptions suck anyways the NARS
radiant creamy concealer is amazing I'm
wearing it today as well to sort of
highlight my face and conceal and it's
concealers I'm going to talk about our
concealers that almost ended up in the
Ogando section a couple of months ago
what I'm talking about are the Laura
Mercier secret camouflage concealers I
got to I got number sc1 and I also got
number st2 to kind of get the perfect
color match and to mix and match each
other I always get two shades because I
kind of always want to get the perfect
match so I bought these a long long time
ago and I didn't like them at all they
were super for my feeling dry and they
didn't do anything and all my mind was
saying was if ELISA loves these how can
I not love them and these have grown on
me so much I cannot live without these
and they are very different to other
concealers on the market as these are
quite dry they are drier than a normal
concealer and also it seems like at
first when you put it on it doesn't seem
so pigmented but if you just put a
little bit more work in it and actually
Pat it in right the coverage is amazing
and the sort of the drier finish is
perfect to make it stay all day long you
don't see it that's the perfect stuff
you don't see this on the skin and that
is why it's called secret camouflage I
definitely had to get
so these and I think that if you buy
these and you get them for the first
time you definitely have to get used to
them as well just like I did but trust
me if you keep working with these and
give them a couple of chances because
these definitely need it more than one
chance you will love them a skin care
product that I've been loving is by Hana
and that it is a a brand that my mom
sells in her web shop at Hana has dot NL
basically my entire skincare routine is
Hana products just because I love the
brand I love their moisturizers and
their serums and there are cleansing
stuff so I'm just a huge big fan of Hana
and as I told you in the beginning of
this month my skin was so dry like I can
assure you Campbell's we're walking all
over it so what I do is I just cleanse
my face I put all my serums and
moisturizers on and then as last step I
put the cell recovery cream from
Chanukah hostess moisturizer is so good
it makes your skin feel like angels
another thing I bought because of Lisa
Eldridge is chanel natural finish loose
powder and I got it in number 20 Claire
this was definitely be one of the best
powders I've ever used because it has
sort of like micro light reflecting
parts in it that make your skin look
super glowy it makes you look super
healthy I've been actually wearing this
in my last three videos and Mayer Sade I
kind of look good in there and I
definitely think this powder for that
because it's just such a natural looking
powder you don't see it lying on your
skin it's super finely milled it's so
soft and just when you put this on you
just your your face transforms into a
Chanel powdered goodness and I shattered
I feel loving is by Mac and this is the
extra dimension I shadow in a natural
flirt after using this in a lot of
videos lately and it's I would describe
it as vanilla pigment but a little bit
warmer and a little bit more sensual it
has definitely that same sort of
beautiful glow that vanilla gives you
and it's so sunning I don't know if it's
so available at Mac but a natural flirt
extra dimension eyeshadow by Mac is
stunning if you're using it as my
highlighter sort of glowy highlighter on
my face for days now
inner corner highlights on my eyes this
baby right here is betting then I've
been also loving the overshadow sex pot
by the bomb in no money no honey it's a
boo boo honey boo boo
Adama makes me hollow I've never tried
the balm products before and when I saw
here we go talking about the video again
miss fames a drag tutorial on here on
YouTube and what miss fame did was she
put a really small dot of highlighter on
the tip of her nose and what you use for
that is the overshadow sexpot pigment by
the balm in no money no honey this color
is everything is so shiny and light
reflective and just stop Gobert another
thing for eyes that I've been loving are
the makeup studio drew whole eye shadow
mooses I did a full blog post review on
this and I will put a link down in the
info box so you can check that out these
are super hardcore stay on I shadow
mooses they come in tons of colors and I
actually should watch all the colors
that are available in stores right now
on my blog and I have four favorites my
first favorite is be bronzed and next is
edgy emerald also loving turquoise
treasure lslam at least is a violet
vanity these four colors together
already make an awesome look and what I
love about these is that at first when I
tried the I talked about this in the
review but um at first when I tried
these I wasn't really expecting anything
because they were so wet and sort of
dickly and not really it just I didn't
really expect anything from them it did
not get all so that immediately changed
my mind on these and I love the color
but it's the last thing we want to talk
about is for my Dutch she's only we all
know the Hema and I what I did not know
is that the Hema has brush cleansers I
always spot clean my brushes with my Mac
brush cleanser but it's just it's too
expensive for what it's really doing and
I I never really like using it because
it's kind of expensive and and it spills
and it's not nice so then when I walked
into the doctor store Hema
because medic brush cleaner and you guys
it's exactly the same as the Meg brush
cleanser I think this is even better
because when I have like a deep deep
black color in my brush and I tried to
get it off with the spa cleaning method
and when I use the Mac brush cleanser it
gets gray but when I use this it gets
white it like it gets clean and I think
it was only three euros 60 so that is
okay so I still have more but I feel
like this video is getting way too long
so I'm gonna save this for February um
and let's go on to the oh god knows oh
yeah no poor the oh god knows this month
