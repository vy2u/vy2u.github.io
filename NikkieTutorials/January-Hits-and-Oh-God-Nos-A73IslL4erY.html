jen-jen
of my English today I miss you guys so
so much and um I'm proud to say that I'm
completely flew free I kicked the flu's
ass with my socks on yeah so today I
decided to do my January hits and oh god
knows of January a little disclaimer is
that um I didn't really wear a lot of
makeup this month because I was sick I
had the flu and let me tell you when
you're sick makeup on your skin looks
like Antarctica but dry so I don't
really have a whole lot of makeup
products but I do have a lot of skin
care products because my skin was
horrendous I wasn't wearing any makeup
for like six five days maybe eight my
skin just got worse and worse and I
didn't get it because I was like I'm not
wearing any makeup and I'm treating my
skin well so why are you getting worse
I think the flu has a really bad sort of
reaction on your skin also for my nails
my all my nails broke off I felt like I
was in contagion that movie okay so
let's get cracking I hate it when people
say that okay so the first thing I want
to talk about is the Dermalogica daily
microphone this is a sort of daily scrub
that you can use daily dot the first day
didn't really notice any like big
differences but like two days after I
was like wow it really does work so if
you're having a little bit of a bad skin
day and you really want to sort of make
your pores shrink a bit then try the
Dermalogica daily microphones and then
in order to sort of moisturize my skin
hardcore after that um I fell in love
and words cannot express my love for
this this is the henna cell recovery
cream and this is basically one of the
thickest fullest sort of hardcore
moisturizing as' moisturizers
ever I've never really come across
something so rich and so you only need
like a teeny tiny bit
look at that it's super duper um
rich that's the word it just deserves
it's rich so I put on the henna cell
recovery cream and it just my skin was
like yes moisture I love you I was like
elevator girl I got you and the great
thing is is that my mom sells this in
her webshop heads cause maids guys dot
NL + + she has a new web shop that sells
Hana products only but this is for the
duchies and I believe the belgium's is -
so my mom has a new web shop like a
second web shop called um-hum a house
dot NL and for my Duchess you want to
buy Hana online then please go check
that out
I'm not sure if I pronounced the link
right but it's here in the screen and
then the infobox below so definitely go
check that out then because my nose was
all like blocked up and I couldn't
really breathe through out my nose I had
to breathe through out my mouth as one
does at night that became a problem
because I hate sleeping with like a
stuck nose like a nose that doesn't
breathe that it just drives me insane
anyways because I'm really really really
sensitive to you getting addicted to
nasal spray these little buggers right
here
I get so addicted to these so I was like
I'm not gonna use that because I know
that when I'm gonna use this I'm not
gonna stop my lips became a dry desert
it was like a dry desert I tried to
think of a place on earth ah it was like
so another favorite this month a hit
this month is the Elizabeth Arden 8 hour
cream and I've talked about this so many
times once again Elizabeth Arden 8 hour
cream saved my lips okay then the next
product is actually like a really big
surprise to me because I'm gonna say it
I hated this at first I was like
everyone was talking about it I bought
it I you
did I was like this is crap I'm talking
about the naked 1 palette by urban decay
it's been rotting away my makeup so much
for months and months now and I didn't
look at it I didn't want to look at it
because I felt like it was so so so
overrated and I just wanted to throw it
away
so then one day I was cleaning my makeup
storage and I came across the Naked
palette by urban decay again and I was
like you know I gotta give you a chance
again because you were kinda expensive
and I have to give you a chance to try
and use you I kind of forced myself on
to using this every single day I've
actually grown to love this I can't live
without this some of these colors in
here are insane I love I love naked
I love buck I love half-baked I love
toasted toasted is the best color of all
and I love hustle and sin and virgin I
love this palette now one thing is that
I gotta force the two are myself as well
because I know that I am hating that as
well right now but if I can force it on
myself to love it like I did with this
one then maybe I have a future with the
naked eye last thing is the Mac exterior
Rose mineralized skinfinish I um I have
no words for this this is insane it's so
pretty at first well there was this up a
chic collection by Mac I still hate the
name of that and they had to mineralize
skinfinish Asteria rose and porcelain
pink I want to marry stereo rose III
have nowhere it's so pretty it's like
healthy and it's like healthy in a pot
if you put this on your cheeks you're
just look healthy you just look people
will look at your face and be like wow
did you have a really great night or
something
or wow did you go to the spa people will
just look at you and assume that you had
the best week of your life because you
look so healthy so that's why I love
these Serio Rose by Mac and I absolutely
highly
recommended to everyone who can get it
if you can still get it because I know
it's really highly demanded so um if you
can get this get this you will love it
ok let's go to my phone now I am came to
my fail I got the iPhone 5 I'm so oh
look at that look at my pretty
background um I'm so happy with the
iPhone 5 I'm totally bragging right now
I'm so sorry quickly you have to get Kit

Instagram pictures with I do every is

now if you love to kind of Instagram
nikkietutorials then get kick em other
hits this month were the movies the
impossible and Hotel Transylvania I
least you are so not comparable because
you have like animated movies and the
tsunami would be impossible I cried my
ass off I was my mouth was open for two
hours basically I couldn't like really
grasp what was going on it was insanely
good and then Hotel Transylvania is just
so funny and so sort of querque and my
favorite TV show this month was the Real
Housewives of Beverly Hills I was sick
I've mentioned that a couple of times
now but Real Housewives of Beverly Hills
I absolutely adore it I love the drama I
love the high glam I love the Louboutins
going everywhere okay then quickly time
for the O get nose of January oh yeah no
okay so the frizz oh god no of course is
the flu I'm gonna leave it there the flu
should die damn girl no the next I'll
God knows for me is the Vampire Diaries
I I'm gonna say it and I know a lot of
people are going to hate me for it I'm
over it I'm at that point where when I
watch it I get bored and I find myself
just doing random stuff and just not
watching it and just not giving a damn
about it
the
only thing that they can still like get
me with is Rebecca's makeup but I have a
feeling that she's gonna die in two
episodes again so I'm kinda over the
Vampire Diaries I'm not gonna watch
anymore I'm just over it I'm sorry no
just no and then the last oh god no is
for Rihanna I'm sorry but her album
