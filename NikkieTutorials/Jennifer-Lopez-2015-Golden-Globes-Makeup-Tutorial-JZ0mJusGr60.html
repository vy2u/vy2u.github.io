makeup tutorial inspired by the look
that JLo Jennifer Lopez wore to the 2015
Golden Globes basically when she hit the
carpet the world Stood Still and just
everyone gasped the Globes were good she
looked stunning say it today I'll be
doing a tutorial on that look I
absolutely loved it so without any
further ado if you want to know how to
get this look right here then please
stay tuned so my skin currently is dry
as so I'm going to put an argan oil on
this is by josie maran and this is the
pure argan oil light it's the light one
oh my god is gonna so dry oh face I'm so
disappointed in you
another products I've been really liking
to punch up my dry skin is the Too Faced
hangover primer this smells heavily it
has coconut water
electrolytes and probiotics in it sure
and this also is great for if you are
having a little bit of a rough skin day
okay on to foundation so I've been
trying to picture out for a couple of
days none I'm really liking it it's a
mixture of the Studio Fix fluid by Mac
and the cavity lucky tattoo foundation
in lights 42 and I'm just gonna dot this
mixture onto my face and I'll be buffing
this in using my Sigma f80 688 F 88
so because we're doing smoky eyes
inspired by JLo chances are that these
smoky colors the dark colors will drop
down onto our face and create fallout so
a little trick is to first see your
foundation then do your brows do your
eyes and then once you reach the bottom
portion of your eyes you first put
concealer and all that on so that you
will not have any fallout so what I'm
going to do now is do my brows
off-camera and then it will be back so I
already put down my base I use my Mac
soft ochre Paint Pot and the first thing
I'm going to do now is taking a light
matte eyeshadow I'm taking this color by
the zoeva smokey eye shadow palette
because it suits my skin tone a lot and
in order to get this blending to be on
sleek you want this blending to be
perfect a little trick is to put down a
matte light color all over the eyes
first and then whatever you put on top
glides is so much easier and blends is
so much easier so that's a great trick
so I'm taking the light color and it's
going all over my eyes from lid to brow
bone
the former transition shades the colors
I'll be using are by makeup geek in
unexpected this shade right here and
also de-rate by anastasia beverly hills
so i'm just taking the two and tilting
my brush up and then smooth this in to
the crease and this is going from outer
to inner corners because JLo has really
nice deep set eyes and we want to mimic
that plus her makeup artist went all the
way in also and make it as smooth as
possible because this will be our
transition shade then now mixing de-rate
with purple rain' by makeup geek and
with this we're going to start defining
that crease out even more so again same
position for the brush and go right in
that crease and start building the
definition and smokiness
for the lid I'm again taking two colors
I'm mixing uh Nastasia Beverly Hills
utopia with mega Peaks prom night and
I'm first laying this down using my
finger and this is going all over the
lid and then with a brush you can go
back in and define not taking purple
rain' and a little bit of black
eyeshadow I'm gonna deepen the outer
parts of my eye I'm not cleaning up my
under-eye area by using my foundation
brush and getting rid of any fallout
that I may have and then now it's time
to do the concealer and then we can work
on the lower lash line so I'm going to
really quickly pop some concealer on
okay now I'm going to go back into
purple rain' and run it all the way
along my lower lash line now with a
pencil brush I'm going to soften the
lines and make them ultra ultra smoky
because they were super smoky on JLo now
going in with the tiniest bit of black
and running it straight to the base of
the roots of my lower lashes time to
darken that waterline I'm taking my
hourglass a 1.5 millimeter mechanical
gel liner and then JLo was also rocking
this super sexy inner corner eyeliner
push it was very vixeny and kitten me
and it was very very sexy
so I'm going to take my Kat Von D tattoo
liner in trooper and I'm going to make
just a really tiny teeny point on the
inner corners just to elongate the eyes
and make a more cat shape and then all
we want to do now is to run a little bit
of black eyeshadow along the roots of my
top lashes
so it's a complete so look all you want
to do now is apply falsies and the ones
I'll be using are max at 36 lashes and
these are perfect because on de l'eau
you could definitely see that day the
Artur corners really flare down and give
that cat shape feel again and these do
that these do that all right time to get
that JLo glow I'm first going to contour
using models using my eye shadow by
Illamasqua in heroine is a new brush
that I've been wanting to get for years
and years never really got to it now I
did the NARS EDA brush this one better
be good after all that hype underneath
cheekbone okay and then to further
bronze I'm taking my Too Faced milk
chocolate light medium matte bronzer I'm
just warming up my face with this for
blush i'll be using Milani Luminoso just
because it goes with everything and JLo
definitely had that really peachy glowy
JLo glow and then to give yourself that
super glow I'm going to go into Becca's
shimmering skin Perfector in moonstone
pressed duh and this is basically almost
going everywhere on the face first of
all
highest points of the cheekbones is a
must
Cupid's bow also a must in my humble
opinion tip of the nose also a must
JLo had a bridge of the nose and this
was a new one to me right in the middle
just above the brows JLo had highlight
right here and that's it for the cheeks
so for the lips JLo weren't this really
cool toned pinky nude color it was super
super nude so we're going to mimic that
but she also had a lot of volume with
lip pencils so I'm going to make my lips
look more full using the LA girl auto
lip liner in nude
a little bit of stone by Mac for
lipstick I'll be using the new Anasazi
Beverly Hills liquid lipstick in
milkshake just because this is their
lightest one and it makes my lips look
like JLo lips so this is going right
over top so once I have this on I'm
going to go back in with the nude other
lip liner by la girl cosmetics and just
feathering in that line more softly and
then to kind of punch back the pink bit
and for the gloss I'll be using a
fortune cookie butter gloss by NYX
and that guy's concludes this JLo Golden
Globes 2015 inspired makeup tutorial I
