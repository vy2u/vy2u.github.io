music video by Iggy Azalea and Jennifer
Lopez which is booty and oh my gosh
dead-ass so much ass I did
I couldn't oh my god these two ladies
looked super smokin hot and I was like
okay I need to find someone to do a
crazy smokin hot collab with and I saw
my solution in crispy throw up your
heads if you love a good collaboration
see ya today's video is inspired by JLo
super gorgeous glowing skin that JLo
glow and it's a super wearable look
actually and crispy did her look
inspired by Iggy
so absolutely don't forget to check out
Krispies video I love her videos she's
so talented and subscribed to her and
show her some love but other than that I
don't have anything else let's just go
right ahead to this j.lo booty look the
first product I'm going to use is by
L'Oreal and it's the lumi magique pure
light primer and this is a really light
reflecting one and you could go for the
Becca shimmering skin Perfector in pearl
but I find that this one right here by
L'Oreal has just a little bit more shine
to it and that is exactly what we want
today so I'm taking that and blending it
in to my skin for foundation today I'm
again taking my benefit hello flawless
oxygen Wow brightening makeup foundation
just because it just it's so beautiful
and I'm the color I'm pure foreshore
ivory at first I'm just dotting that
onto my face and then I'm taking my new
favorite brush this is the Sigma 3d HD
brush and I'm taking a little bit of
Evian um I'm going to spray the brush
and then with the brush just start
buffing in the foundation and what that
Evian facial spray is going to do is
it's going to make the brush a little
bit more moist and this way it's
blending in the foundation in a much
more natural way and every time you feel
like your brush is starting to become a
little bit more dry again just respray
it every buffing now it's time for
concealer and I'm using my trusty Oh
of mac prolongwear in NC 15 and now I'm
taking my Sigma f80 6 and the Evian
spray once more spray it and buffing now
I'm quickly going to set my under eye
area using emphasized shaping powder by
Mac and then I'm going to do brows
off-camera
I'm going to do this all off camera and
then it'll be back okay so now on to
eyes the first thing I'm doing is
applying a base to my entire eye area to
prevent the eyeshadows from creasing and
I'm using my Mac soft ochre paint but
for this next I'm going in these
Saucebox
a tude palette and I'm making a mixture
with three colors because I find that
these three colors combines may just the
perfect crease color for this look so
I'm taking a little bit of caramel
toffee and cream dream and with a zoeva
228 crease brush I'm just lightly
feathering this in to my crease I want
this to be really soft and diffused so
once I have most of the products on I
will take it up a little bit higher and
higher and higher now I'm taking a
little bit of Mac's emphasised shaping
powder and with this I am highlighting
my brow bone and I'm also taking a bit
and loading it up here on the inner
corners because on JLo those inner
corners were so bright and so intense
you really want to lay focus there for
the lid I'm mixing emphasized powder by
Mac again and with a little bit of
makeup geeks bling eyeshadow and as I
said this is going onto my lid leading
up to the crease and all the way to the
outer corners what I like to do now is
take a more concentrated brush this is
by zueva and it's C 231 luxe petit
crease and going back in my crease
shadows and with the tips of the brush
you slightly want to reapply there
crease color and that will make it a
little bit more concentrated as I said
one of the main features of this look
are those intense inner
corners so first laying down a bit of
next eyeshadow in crystal avalanche you
just want to pack that on that inner
corner brightening that up and blending
in a sort of v-shape like this then
going in with the most shimmering
eyeshadow of life nylon eyeshadow by Mac
I'm taking a little moist brush and
going over top and a nylon damp is just
a sparkliest glowy estado of life okay
quickly going to go over to the bottom
lashline and it looks super clean on JLo
yet still should definition with those
lashes so a little trick is to make your
lower lashes pop we don't want any eye
shadow there it's taking a really small
and precise eyeliner for that personally
I love to use the hourglass 1.5
mechanical gel liner in obsidian and all
you want to do is place a couple of dots
on the roots of your lower lashes and
then once you put mascara over top it
just gives it way more definition
so I'm aware of the fact that it looks
super crazy right now but trust me once
you put mascara over top it looks fine
just I mean look at this eye looks fine
okay now to define my upper lash line a
bit I'm going in my the bomb meets match
nude eyeshadow palette and I'm going in
the color matte wood and with an angled
brush I'm placing this super close to
the roots of my lashes and slowly start
building some definition there okay so
once you've got most of that on you want
to take a really small brush this is the
pencil brush by a makeup geek and a
mixing net would with Matt Rosen and all
you want to do with this this smudge out
that line and make it really soft and
diffused and smoky and lived in and uh
on the waterline I'm quickly running
some Ben 9 your choice or cream crayon
in ultra light mp0
and then to finish off on curling my
lashes and applying mascara and false
lashes mascara is going to be the makeup
studio waterproof 3d in extra black and
then for falsies I'm using these I don't
know the brand but they're called Daisy
and these Daisy ones are super natural
and that is exactly what you want to go
for because JLo had really natural ones
on also so I'm just going to pop this on
right now and then we'll be back now on
two cheeks the first thing I'll be doing
is sculpting my cheekbones to make me
look a little bit more you know JLo and
as always I'm using my LM s sky shadow
in heroine for this you know just go to
town and sculpt create those cheekbones
JLo wasn't wearing any blush it was more
so a lot of bronzer and a lots of lots
of shine and glow so I'm just going to
warm up my complexion a bit more using
this bronzing powder by Mac this is
called refined golden you kind of want
to swirl it around of the high plains of
your face and give yourself that
sunkissed look I'm also going to use it
as a blush a little bit because there's
not going to be any blush and then for
that Immaculate glow I'm of course going
for my bed night looks from the air
powder in ice because this toots mice
Tom the best and this is what's going to
give me the most glowy effect of all the
highlighters that I have this doesn't
really suit really dark skin tones nor
medium skin tones I think so the darker
of a skin tone you are the more golden
and bronzer you want to go with your
highlighter so Jennifer was super glowy
like everything was aglow and we're even
going in with a spray later on but the
key focusing points you want to focus on
when highlighting with a powder for this
look is first tops of the cheekbones
super super important so right here sort
of next to your eye oh we're going to
get the glow up in here I'm going to go
a little bit further of course I'm
taking a pencil brush and I'm
highlighting my nose by just drawing a
line in that little scoop here and onto
the bridge of my nose and then on the
highest tip of your nose place a little
dot to highlighter like so and then it's
going to lift the tip of your nose up
now what I really noticed is that there
is a lot of highlighter on the Cupid's
bow but also on the highest point of the
forehead and then as I say you also want
to do the Cupid's bow take a little bit
more and onto the highest point of your
chin for me that's right here right
there so I'm going to take a fixed plus
by Mac and whenever you want a super
ultra glow super high do we finish fix+
and I'm quickly going in with a
stippling brush and stipple this out so
you get an even do we finish and then to
finish off this look all you need to do
is your lips so I'm going to completely
blank out my lips because her lips were
nude so I'm taking the hourglass
lipstick in some nude number one because
I wanted to use myth by Mac but I found
that to be too dead in the face so I
want a little bit more a miss
and then for a clause I'm using this
Illamasqua sheer lip gloss in exquisite
I may want to take a little bit more and
especially focus it on the highest point
of your Cupid's bow to really reflect
that light
