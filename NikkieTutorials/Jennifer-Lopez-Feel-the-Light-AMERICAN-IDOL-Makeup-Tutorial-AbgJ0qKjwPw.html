tutorial on dinner for Lopez's
performance on American Idol from her
new single feel the lights Jennifer it
looked like a goddess
no she looked like a twinkling dazzling
goddess fairy itself no words
I was absolutely dying over her look it
was so sparkly so intensely gorgeous I I
just knew I had to recreate it for you
yeah without any further ado if you want
to know how to get this sparkly JLo look
right here then please keep on watching
all right guys so already went ahead and
did my foundation concealer brows and
all that stuff and it also already
applied a base to my eyelids to prevent
everything from creasing now onto the
first eyeshadow this is by uh Nastasia
Beverly Hills this is called bone and I
find blue eyeshadows to be one of the
hardest colors to blend so little trick
is to take a light colored eyeshadow a
nude tone and brush it all over your
eyelids and that will make blending
easier so just with bone I'm just going
all over my eyes now for the blue in the
crease I'll be using two eyeshadows the
first one is my auto serife Lee Hills
this is called star blue and I'll also
be using this foiled eyeshadow by makeup
geek and this is called centerstage now
really slowly start blending these two
colors into your crease now again I find
blue to be one of the hardest colors to
work with so you want to go little by
little don't rush yourself take all the
time you need for blending I want to
keep the outer edge more of a rounded
shape as opposed to a more angular and
winged shape so I'm just gonna keep it
soft and follow the curves of my crease
now little by little start working your
way into the inner part of your crease
I just really smoothly and lightly blend
that in take your time then to make the
blend a little bit smoother I'm going to
go in with another unassessed Beverly
Hills eyeshadow this is called a stone
with this
center stage only I'm going to intensify
the blue a little bit privileged I'll
also be making a mixture of two
Anastasia Beverly Hills eye shadows the
first one is gold rush and the second
one is suede and as I said this is just
going on to the lid blending into the
blue
all right then for the lower lash line
I'm again taking center stage and that
is going from the outer corner to about
halfway in then because I don't want to
make the lower lash line too stark into
cool-toned I'm bringing in some warmth
using this eye shadow by makeup geek
this is called it latte I'm taking
center stage again and going over top
alright now it's time for that insane
Sparkle so I'm going to take this makeup
studio jewel effects in sparkle and
literally I'm going to dust this all
over my eyeballs and not just on the
eyelids everywhere
therefore even more shine and sparkle
makeup studios jewel effects in shine
and this is going on the inner corners
and the brow bone I'm gonna line my
waterline using my expression I'm
cutting this out because student doesn't
camera is unfortunately ugly and all you
want to do now is eyeliner and we're
first going to create a little tiny
point on the inner corner to elongate
the eyes and then follow along the lash
line and no wing
all I'm gonna do now is apply mascara
and false lashes and then it will be
back alright for cheeks first we need a
little bit of contouring and for that
I'll be using my Illamasqua eyeshadow in
heroine then to further warm up my face
and taking this version what's this
called matte illusion bronzing powder in
number 21
for watch I'm just gonna use alumino so
by Milani just because it fits every
look you could ever imagine so it fits
this now for highlighting you want to go
for the extreme you want to go to the
max because Jennifer had the same
sparkles that she had on her eyes also
applied to the tops of her cheekbones
the first promise I'll be using is this
by Mac this is a silver dusk this is
called silver dusk and it's an
iridescent powder and with this I'm
going to crazy highlights my entire
complexion the glow I wanna go home
oh we're not stopping here I'm going in
with moonstone by Becca and intensifying
that even oh my god oh my god oh my god
oh my god I swear it was a highlighter
in my previous life okay now for that
actual Sparkle that intense insane
Sparkle that JLo was wearing I'm again
taking the makeup studio jewel effects
and sparkle just a tiny bit and just
stipple that on to the highest points of
your cheekbones oh I feel like a fairy
like a dazzling sparkling angel alright
so for the lips you want to go super
nude and SuperDuper glossy so I'm first
gonna line my lips using this gosh lip
pencil Velvet Touch lip liner in number
sixth angel kiss
then intensifying that with another gosh
Velvet Touch lipliner this is a Noga
crisp therefore lipstick I'm again going
back in with that first lipliner I used
and filling my entire lips in with that
and then just on the center max Smith
lipstick and the fur gloss NYX butter
gloss in fortune cookie
