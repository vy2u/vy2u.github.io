fun to do a recreation slash inspiration
tutorial from Jennifer Lopez this new
music video called I love you papi and I
decided to come up with the twist I love
you Batman so yeah today I'll be doing
this look right here this is the look
that she's rocking when she's sort of
doing the advertisement for the Nokia
tablet where she's like oh boy so if you
want to know how to get this Jennifer
Lopez I know you papi music video
inspired look then please keep on
watching so I already applied my base
and for that I use my Mac soft ochre
Paint Pot I'm now going to sculpt my
crease using a little bit of shade ster
blush by Mac and JLo was rocking a
really sort of rounded eye so there
wasn't really an outer V it's just a
really sort of circle of definition
around her eyes so what I'm going to do
is with that shade ster blush I'm going
to just sculpt out that entire shape
that I want and I want it to be rounded
just going to start at this outer part
here and slightly start building
dimension on the outer part of the eye
and keep it round what I also notice is
that the makeup artist went above her
crease so you want to do that as well
going above your crease and then coming
into the crease again at the inner part
here so keep going in with that g8 ster
blush and built that definition and
sculpt that eye for the lower lash line
I'll be using Mac's
embark and Coco bear by makeup geek and
basically what you want to do is just
smoke this along the lower lash line and
go from the inner corner to the outer
corner because this entire lower part of
the eyelid was really intense and smoky
and sort of like deep you just want to
take those colors and buff them in there
and with an angled brush I'm going all
the way to that inner corner and then
with the pencil brush dipped in Coco
bear I'm going to diffuse and blend out
the edges down and that will really give
that in 10
smokey look but remember don't go too
far down because then you will just look
like an addict okay now you want to
connect the bottom part to the crease
and you do that by just taking a pencil
brush and going back and forth from top
to bottom and then also kind of wiggle
it in the crease of it and that will
give this outer part a little bit more
definition of course you want that
crease to be blended out so for that
I'll be taking my Tarte magnificent
palette and I'll be taking this color
right here and just really softly start
diffusing the edges and blend them out
I'm going to take this highlighting
powder by Mac called emphasized and I'm
going to highlight my inner corners with
this don't be afraid with this one also
pop it on the highest point of your arch
like the highest point of your arch with
your brow you you know what I mean and
then with that inner corner kind of tap
it in dust it in do some magic with it
so for Villa Jennifer wore an amazing
pearlescent white shadow and I loved it
with this look and for this I'll be
going to my sugarpill called chemistry
pellets and from the palette i'll be
using diamond eyes and i love the sort
of stark cool white color with the warm
Browns and the crease in the lower lash
line i think it's an amazing sort of
twist of colors and then of course what
you also want to do with this white is
go above your crease a little bit
because we kind of created our own new
rounded crease so of course at your lid
color up until your new crease as well
and then also pop it to the inner
corners just a tiny bit not too much
just a tiny bit that's it i shadow eyes
all i'm going to do now is just check a
little bit of dark eye shadow along my
upper lash line just to grab the look a
little bit more and hide my fake lashes
of course and further than going back
into my tarte magnificent palette and it
actually has the best black and dark
brown eyeshadows i have ever experienced
like a mixture between those two and
then just smudge that along my upper
lashline and just go ahead and in
between your lashes play some of that
dark dark dark brown almost black color
and this will really ground everything
and for the waterline you'll be using my
favorite Ben Nye neutralizer cream
crayon in ultra light now go ahead and
do all the lash work and for that we'll
be using to scare us this is the makeup
studio what approved 3d extra black and
then on top of that I'll be applying mix
extended play gigablack and get
gigablack lash that one the blue one and
therefore falsies I'll be using the Mac
36 lashes okay so our cheeks there's two
things you want to do one put on that
bronze and to put on that JLo glow so I
already contoured using my Illamasqua
eyeshadow in heroine and are two further
Brunt's of my complexion I'll be using
two products and one is the Illamasqua
the disobey blush and this is the
refined golden bronzer by Mac so I'm
gonna switch the two together and sort
of add warmth to your face which is sort
of making a three so one three four
chicks I'm going simple and soft using
my Tarte Amazonian clay blush in Excel
and just go so well exposed and of
course for my highlight my Mac extra
dimension skin finish in whisper of
guilt and I'm applying this to the
highest points of the cheekbones nose
tip of the nose chin and right here
above the brows like that
so I absolutely love jell-o slips for
this look so I'm going to try my hardest
to come up with something that looks
close to it so I'm going to first line
my lip so make them a little bit fuller
using stripped-down lip pencil by Mac
okay now I think I'm going to pop a
little bit of a Velvet Matte lip pencil
by nurse in bolero on top you know what
else serving like the middle only and
then I'm going to take this revlon
colorburst matte balm in two three five
mischievous I'm just gonna pop that on
the part that hasn't got any color yet
okay then just kind of smack her lips
together I really like this but it needs
gloss because she or gloss so for that
we'll be taking this Kiko final lips a
liquid lipstick in number one doesn't
have a name but
and that guy's completes my Jennifer
Lopez JLo I'll owe you papi music video
