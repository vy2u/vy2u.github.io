inspired by Jessie J's new music video
called flashlight no that's how the song
goes
she's sporting two looks in the video
one is supernatural winged liner Newt
lips and the other one is sort of like
this event be going out clubbing sexy
smoky eyes dark nude lips so I chose for
the last look and I absolutely adore it
it's so sensual some okie sexy fun STI
without any further ado if you want to
know how to get this look then please
stay tuned I'm doing this thing now
where I take up the first portion of my
hair when I'm doing a top knot because I
don't want people to think of that
involved the first product I'll be using
today is by Nivea this is the Nivea men
and this is called aftershave balm so I
talked about this in my April head
synagogue nose and what this actually
does it's the best primer you could ever
think of because the second most used
ingredient in this mixture is glycerin
and what does glycerin do glycerin make
stuff stick to it so when you put this
on your face your foundation sticks to
it and lasts longer and as it starts to
dry you can really feel it becoming
tacky and it's exactly what you want
then I'm going in with the Smashbox
primer water I just really like the way
this makes my face feel when I'm doing
my foundations for foundation today I'm
going to use the Mac Studio Fix fluid in
NC 15 I just I've been really loving how
this makes my skin look so I'm going to
use it today and the brush I'll be using
is the flat angled kabuki brush by Sigma
it's the S 88
for concealer I'm going to use max Pro
Longwear in NC 15
and then with my Real Techniques funds
are going to work this all in and
quickly setting it with powder to
prevent it from creasing alright so I
already went ahead and prime my lids so
we can get straight to work
the first eyeshadow I'll be using is a
latte by makeup geek I'm just starting
off by applying this straight into my
crease mainly on the outer corners for
now we're going to wing the shape just a
tiny bit on the outer corners just the
tiniest bit then with a smaller more
precise blending brush this is the Mac
221 I'm going to drag it on towards the
inner part of my crease and then nicely
blended together just go ahead and keep
intensifying that on the lower lash line
I'm applying a mixture of makeup geeks a
latte and unassessably Hills smoke and
sorry for my nails you just want to
smoke this from outer to inner corners
on the little be applying a mixture of
makeup geeks fold eyeshadow in in the
spotlight and also by makeup geek and
also fold eyeshadow magic act then again
with anastasia beverly hills smoke i'm
deepening the outer crease and corners
now with my hourglass 1.5 mechanical gel
liner i'm going to line my waterline
plus inner corners and i'm afraid i'm
going to do this off camera because i
can do this on camera so pretty much did
the entire eye tutorial and i found out
that my camera was there recording so
let's talk you through it after applying
the black pencil to my waterline i went
in with a black eyeshadow and i buffed
and smoked it out then all i did was my
winged eyeliner and for that yzma caveny
tattoo liner in trooper in my NYC black
liquid liner and all i did was create a
wink liner that is a little bit more
thick but not as winged out
now all that you want to do is apply
mascara and falsies and the falsies of
using today are by house of lashes and
these are the heartbreakers waiting for
that to dry waiting for that to dry and
lastly mascara on the lower lashes okay
alright for cheeks what I'm now going to
do is contour because if I don't look
like the bald guy from Game of Thrones
now I'm going to contour today using my
Kat Von D shade and light palette with
this color gonna shade with this color
then to warm up my complexion I'm taking
the L'Oreal glam bronze and number one
if you're really enjoying this for blush
I'm using a tiny bit of Mac's
peaches now for an all-over glow I'm
taking this Bobbi Bratz buck Bobbi
I've been getting so many comments that
have pronounced it wrong Bobbi this is
the highlight powder in bronze glow and
just with a bigger brush this is by a
wave uh and then kind of glow all over
my cheeks and after that I applied above
the arch of my row does just basically
your entire face and then for an intense
glow I'm taking the mary lou manizer by
the balm i just i didn't want to use
moonstone again because I've been using
one's own in every tutorial I did what's
going on with my hair yeah oh that is oh
it's been a long time my friend that's
it for the cheek alright for lips Jessi
wore this super nice matte somewhat
darker new lips I'm gonna line my lips
using swirl lip pencil by Mac
now for liquid lipstick I'm going to
take Beach sleek mat me liquid lipstick
and this is the color birthday suit and
then because that is a little bit too
pinky I'm going to go in with honest
Liza Beverly Hills pure Hollywood and
