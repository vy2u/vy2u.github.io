on Jessie J um it's completely inspired
what I always notice on Jessie J is that
um she has either black lips really
bright red really bright pink lips and
always are not always but most of it a
time her black smokey eye she normally
has some rhinestones on her lips but I
wanted them on my eyes um yeah Jessie J
today I also want to tell you about some
nail polishes that my mom is going to
sell in a wreck shop they're called yet
day and I made some blog posts on my
website Inka tutorials calm ever read
they have a really bright green I have a
nice purple gold so my mom is going to
sell the siete polishes nail polishes
today in our shop and her shop is heads
close mates guys spin to nail dotter
nail so please go check her out she
sells makes to do a Dermalogica and now
the polishes as well which rock and I
made some blog posts on them so check it
out and if you want to know how it is
just DJ look then please keep on
watching okay so the first thing I did
was I applied a base and the one I'm
using is my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot
we're using the bare palette from Sigma
they are brand new and this is a look at
it the colors I'm going to be using our
shine control some hitch and some
command and I'm pretty much going to use
the entire palette so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to take a 239 by Mac and
I'm going to go into shine the glittery
black and I'm just going to start up in
this corner right here making sort of a
point and I'm just following my lid and
make sure you pat this color on because
it's a black and it's glittery and when
you smear it on you're gonna get fallout
like no other I just put it all the way
up to the crease
it's kind of end in a point now I'm
going to take the blending brush that is
in the palette as well and I'm just
going to blend the edges of the black
I'm going to take a little bit of the
hitch which is a dark brown color and
I'm going to go in the crease as well
he's really lightly blended and then I'm
going to take a really big blending
brush and I'm going to blend it until
it's soft and now what you want to do is
just kind of take the blending brushes
and just blend some black into the
crease and then some Brown again until
you have like the amount of black that
you want I'm kind of blending it out
really softly as a brown one highlight
I'm using elope which is the second
lightest color and I'm just going to put
that on my brow bone now for the inner
corners I'm going to make a mixture
between um commend act and elope and if
that makes sort of a like natural color
I love it and just put that onto the
inner corners and then blend it in a bit
and then I'm going to take my shine
again and I'm going to kind of fade it
away so it's just barely there um
approach on the inner inner corners and
if we're to lower living on the tick
control and just make a black line under
your eye and right here in that corner
connected to like that wing that you
made out that like point blend that
and I'm just going to apply some black
eye Kohl to my waterline and my top
waterline this is Urban Decay's 24/7
glide-on eye pencil
I'm going to use some mascara which is
CoverGirl's
flash blast fusion waterproof and some
false lashes um I have done many videos
where I just show how I did it like my
Adele video so watch that but I'm using
my Mex number threes and that are to
place on each other okay so the lashes
are on and for the rhinestones I am I
have this like thingy from essence and
it's supposed to pick up glitter
rhinestones for the nails and it's
really really small and you really can
pick up anything small with it as well
and then I had this rhinestone wheel
from siete you have some lash glue here
so what I'm first going to do is with
that like nail singie it has a really
small dot thingy on it
I'm going to take some nail glue and are
I'm going to take some eyelash glue and
dot where I want the rhinestones to be
and then I'm going to wet that thingy
off and go into the rhinestones and
place them under eyelash glue dots you
can pair this with some new clips and
then you're done and put your fringe out
or apply a fake fringe what I noticed is
that just a day wears a lot a lot of
bright colored lips it's either black um
bright red bright neon pink and it's a
is that the mailman yeah I'm using very
mo lipstick in number 52 and it's a
bright bright neon color I got this from
Ellis and Joe have Essentials dot and
knelt
