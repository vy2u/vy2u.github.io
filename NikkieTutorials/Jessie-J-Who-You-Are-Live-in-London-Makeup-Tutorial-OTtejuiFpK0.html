Jessie J live in London her performance
for who you are I absolutely love it
it's sort of looks like my calves Wendy
tutorial but this eyeliner makes it so
unique absolutely love it
so um if you want to know how it does
then please keep on watching ok so the
first thing I'm going to do is I just
cannot hear myself like I have a cold
and my ears are just clocked and I just
like I sound so muted so the first thing
I'm going to do is apply a base to my
analyst to prevent the eyeshadow from
creasing and the one I'm using is my
Paint Pot in soft ochre from Mac so the
first thing I'm going to do for the eyes
is take my met chroma graphic pencil and
pure white and I'm just gonna highlight
the inner corners a bit so that the
shimmer that is going on top really pops
so I'm just gonna put some on my inner
corners to highlight it okay and then
I'm gonna take my finger and buland it a
bit I'm gonna take this makeup City of
Hope that I custom-made myself I'm gonna
take this baby champagne e color that is
called makeup studio Lumiere eyeshadow
in classy champagne and I'm just gonna
put that over the white then I'm gonna
take the color underneath which just
called rusty radians and I'm gonna mix
those two so give a like really nice
bronzy color for the middle of the lid
now I'm going to take LMS cus Wolfe
eyeshadow and I first gonna put that on
the outer corner of my lid to darken it
up a bit and blend it in and then I'm
just going to make that pointy shape
that is going on so I'm just gonna
follow the direction I have to go just
so I'm gonna follow the direction of my
waterline then I'm going into my crease
with it and I'm filling it in
okay so as you can see I kind of made a
point right there now I'm going to blend
it out to make it softer I'm gonna use
Mac's Swiss chocolate and a little bit
of quark and I'm just going to blend the
crease out of it and give it a little
bit more definition and just really
softly wipe it out to give it that
pointy feeling I'm going to take a big
blending brush and just a little bit of
quark and really make it softer by just
wiping it around I'm going to darken
that outer part up with some black and a
mixture of wolf so black is mixed carbon
and wolf by Illamasqua again it's gonna
darken that outer crease up a bit and
then the outer corners right here okay
then with the wolf i should't from
Illamasqua i'm gonna smoke a little bit
of brown underneath my lower lashes and
in the middle you kind of want to go
down a little bit further so right here
you can just make it brown like you
always would and then I'm just going to
go to the middle right here in the
middle like the width of your pupil kind
of go down there and you're gonna blend
it out and smoke it out a bit
okay then the last part of our shadow is
to take LMS cup eur pigment in for ore
and what I'm going to do is highlight my
inner corners in the middle of my lit
with this so I'm gonna take a little bit
of that pigment then highlight the inner
corners right there and put it on the
middle of your lid like really close to
the lashes and then the width of your
pupil and that really highlights the lid
a lot now the eye liner is actually
really simple it may look a little bit
difficult but it really is really simple
gonna take this nail art brush and it's
really releasing and that's just what I
want because then you can't really make
that point on the inner corners and the
eyeliner I'm using is the black track
fluid line by Mac so I'm gonna do is
follow my lower waterline in
you see how just make that point I'm not
just gonna fill it in and make it a
little bit more thick I'm just gonna
make a wing right here and then just
really really really crisp and clean
make a really small line along your
lashes after that wing I'm just gonna
follow the dark part of that outer
corner
and then with wolves I'm kind of gonna
blend that eyeliner into the eyeshadow
on top but I'm not going to do is take a
black icon for that I'm using my 21st 7
Urban IPE glide on pencil and I'm just
gonna fill in my waterline first Sarah
I'm gonna use this makeup studio water
was just in Volume Mascara and I'm just
gonna put that on my lashes and then I'm
gonna put some falsies on these are the
Ardell wispies in black so I'm gonna put
those on and I'm gonna put two little
rhinestones underneath my eye and what
jessie was wearing a sort of tear duct
was a tear drop a tear drop don't tear
that i don't have that so i'm just gonna
make it mine and add two round
rhinestones underneath and then i will
be back for the red lips
I'm gonna take this Inglot color this is
a pellet I made myself I have no you
which a number of this is but I will put
it on my website like I always do I'm
gonna to kind of make it a little bit
darker around the edges I'm gonna take
Nick's a lipstick and soon our white and
that looks like that her lipstick wasn't
really glossy but it did shine really
really pretty so I'm just gonna have
like a blot some lip gloss on or like
dab it on and this is NYX plush red a
lip gloss so I'm going to do that all of
my lips right now
of course if you have a fringe then just
rock it out I do have a fake friend
anyways as I said for fullness without
prints because of techniques to toriel's
comm I'm thinking guys so so so much for
watching I love you and I'll play over
see you guys next time
