my July hit synagogue notes it's been a
crazy life-changing month actually so
this month Rick and I got the keys to
our apartment I've been talking about
this process for months now a lot of
months actually and so many times we
didn't know if we would actually get it
and so many times we thought we had
actually lost the apartment because of
some things but then finally last week
we got the keys to our apartment so this
week has been super crazy with buying
toilet like snapchat knows what's up so
this past week has been super crazy
we've been working on the apartment
we've been painting everything we're now
putting in the floor see how that is
what has been happening to me this month
I'm dying to know if anything
life-changing happened to you this month
let me know in the comments down below
but without any further ado I have a
couple of hits for you this month so
let's get right to it the first product
I want to talk about is by morphe
brushes and this is the 35o palette now
if you follow me on snapchat you know
that this came in this morning but I've
been obsessing over all the morphe
palette to be super honest with you at
first when they came in I thought I was
going to hate them because they reminded
me so much of the good old day 120
palettes and once you start to play with
real makeup then you know that the 120
palette was not on fleek so at first
when these came in they reminded me of
that 120 palette from eBay and I was
like oh I don't know about this don't
know about this but then once I actually
started trying out the shadows I am in
love and I know some people are if you
with morphe but let me tell you their
palettes really are amazing originally I
was going to talk about another palette
but once this came in this morning I
knew I had to show you this is the 35o
palette and it's a palette filled with
warm Brown tone shadows eyeshadow wise
this is the only thing I'm wearing on my
eyes today so this entire look was
created with this I mean come on this is
my name written all over it
palate is just me in a nutshell it's
warm tones shimmery shiny glamorous
colors but still the fun colors the Pops
of orange and the pops of yellow and I
love this
see I highly recommend you're checking
out the morphe brushes palettes they are
really good I assure you of that
please trust me in that so yeah that's
number one while we're talking about
morphe I might as well mention my new
favorite highlighting brush this is the
morphe m5o one and this has taken over
my highlighting life because this just
tapers that highlight on so OnPoint it's
just so good you just pick some of the
highlighter up with this brush you
dusted all over your cheek bones above
your arch nose Cupid's bow chin and
you're like strobed to the gods yeah
there's not much to say to it actually
it's just the best highlighting brush in
my life right now if our nation I have
been obsessing over this month is by Too
Faced and it's called Born This Way I
feel like I was the only one loving that
song so the Born This Way Foundation by
Too Faced is actually really really good
it has great coverage which you know I
love and still it looks like skin I've
been wearing this I think all throughout
this month and people have been
complimenting me on my skin on Instagram
on YouTube on the streets in the toilet
light stores I'm just really really
liking this foundation it is opaque it
looks like skin it comes in a bunch of
colors it has a satin finish and if you
apply with a Beauty Blender or a sponge
it will become a little bit more glowy
then when you apply with a brush see
I've been really liking this foundation
it lasts so long I really like it try it
out what also has been helping my skin
tremendously in looking good is this Ola
bow oh lab oh Allah boo is what I like
to call it this is the umma boo truffle
indulgences cream and I wanted to
mention this last month because I just
started trying it out then and I fell in
love with it already but I felt like in
order for me to talk about a moisturizer
I want to try it out to the max so I
tried it out for about two months now
and I cannot live without this more
sure I said this literally honestly
smells like truffle and truffle I never
knew truffle were so goddamn good and
the best thing about this moisturizer is
is that it moisturizes so well we'll put
this on at night it will wake up with
skin as soft as a baby's butt
it is so moisturizing and the smell is
so heavily I cannot live without this
moisturizer it has pretty much knocked
out two moisturizers out of my daily bag
it's taken over this is taken over I I
died next up I want to talk about four
new melt cosmetics lipsticks these are
from the nude collection I am literally
obsessed with these I'm wearing this one
sexed I'm wearing sex on my lips right
now I love this especially because it
can be so hard for pill or fair girls
and boys to find a perfect pill new
lipstick I'm wearing it on my lips today
it looks so nude so fleshy so nudie I
absolutely love it I really really
enjoyed this collection and I love that
they cater to every skin tone out there
and this pill color right here sex is
perfect for us pill people next up is
this mascara by Mac and at first when I
got this I was like is it a lipstick no
it's just a Mac mascara in a really tall
lipstick tube this is what the mascara
looks like it has a very it on my head
now it has a very tiny spiked plastic
bristle portion and again if you follow
me on snapchat you know I got this in
this morning but I tried it today for my
lower lashes and I can already assured
is going to be my new favorite lower
lashes mascara it just grabs and coastal
lower lashes so easily so quickly
without even doing anything and it just
makes your lower lashes look damn good I
think it didn't tell you what it's
called it's called the upward lash
mascara by Mac it comes in you can
recognize it because it just looks like
you're very tall lipstick bullet and
then it's just it's amazing for the
lower lashes also I've been diving in
into the nose contouring lately I stayed
away
from nose contouring because I felt like
my nose looked fine and then the other
day I was just playing around a bit and
I tried to contour my nose in the most
natural way possible and I found that
the most natural way to do it with was
with the derma color creams so these are
by Kryolan and these are from the derma
color palette and this color right here
is d8 and this one right here is d9 and
I mix the two together
and it's a cream product so right before
I set my face with powder I just go in
with a brush on the sides of my nose and
kind of tip it here at the at this and
then I blend it in with a Beauty Blender
and it just looks so natural and defined
at the same time I really like what it's
doing to my nose especially in pictures
it just makes a world of a difference so
d8 and d9 derma colors by Kryolan are
the shiznit if you're a fair like me
also quickly I want to mention that
honestly Beverly Hills came out with new
liquid lipstick shades and my favorite
from the new launch is dusty rose I
featured this in my Kylie Jenner makeup
tutorial plus also on Instagram I did a
couple of posts with it and I just
really it's just a very fun color last
but not least this perfume right here I
am living for this packaging this is the
Lancome Tresor la nuit perfume this is I
believe the midnight edition and it's
all I've been wearing on my body this
month I got this actually because my
friend Sharon has been wearing it all
the time and every time I would meet up
with her I'd be like okay this scent I
just sent up my body so after sniffing
her for a week or two I finally decided
to get it for myself so here it is I
love the packaging I'm the worst at
describing scents but I would describe
it as a ride at a mysterious theme park
filled with flowers in the middle of the
night
that's it that's it nailed it
that's it that's it I nailed it yeahso
la nuit is absolutely perfect for me oh
wait before you do oh my god so those
were all my hits for the month of July
now normally I would go to my Oh godno
portion of the video but the happy
 camper that I am I do not have
an oh god no this month maybe it's
because I didn't wear as many new
products this month so I couldn't really
see if I hated
something I do actually apologize I'm so
sorry I know people look forward to
hearing about my oh god no every month
but I don't have one hopefully next
month I will happen oh god no for now
