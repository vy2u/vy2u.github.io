a video like that hey guys so today I am
here to bring you my July hits it oh god
knows and a July has been crazy hot and
crazy just crazy July normally I ask
this little app on my iPhone called
paperless and it's like sort of like an
list app rate can list things like you
can write things down you have a to-do
list and then you can check things off
it's an amazing app paperless there you
go
hit number one but normally I have this
like little map of July hits and God
knows and then every month I change the
month and then renew the list and then
just every time I have a product that I
really love I write it down in that list
and then by the end of the month I have
one entire list of products that I want
to throw you guys and last night I
checked my phone and it didn't have
anything in it what that means that I
didn't find anything special enough to
immediately write down but then I
started thinking and did some
brainstorming and then I was like oh I
did love a lot of stuff in like my
entire table is so full of stuffs right
now so let's go so this month I went to
Majorca with it looks like Sharon and
Scioscia and Sasha has a tumblr and
Sharon has a beauty block and I will put
both their links in the down bar down
bar I've never said down bar infobox so
we went to me org and we had an amazing
time and the weather was so horrible a
lot and they had Kiko I absolutely adore
keko keko it's one kekekeke oh it's just
so affordable and the like the quality
is amazing so I hoard it Kiko the best
thing is like I hoarded Kiko but I
wasn't like poor after I still have
money so the first hit this month is by
Kiko and this is the long-lasting wet
and dry eye shadow in number 200 and you
guys this is max extra dimension skin
finish in a smaller pot I you not
this is like the exact same thing and
this is a beautiful sort of like
talak rose gold silver it's just so
pretty I absolutely love the wet-dry
eyeshadows by Kiko I bought three ah I
like oh thank you I'm so oh my god by
the way if you're liking my hair go
check out Leanne says her pin-up hair
tutorial because I love Leah there's
another hit just I'm nowhere I love Liam
says here on YouTube and I love her hair
and she does this thing or sort of like
rolling in her front part of her hair
and every time I watch her videos I'm
like Maybelline's Dream Lumi touch in
radiant hated this at first like I first
got it because I saw an ad
missglamorazzi channel and I just I it
looked really good so I was like I got
AB side too so then so clone 79 brought
that from Canada to here last year when
we was at this year or last year when we
met each other and went shopping in
Amsterdam she brought this and I first
tried it out and just was like duh
Ingrid no and then a couple of days ago
I finally tried it again and I loved it
it just makes my dark circles just be
going with the wind
next are the Estee Lauder Double Wear a
maximum covers oh my god I do not have
these in a color for my skintone but I
teach FB Academy as most of you know by
now and Joelle Juanita who is the
teacher there as well she used this and
it was like oh when are you using there
to let me borrow it and I used it on my
model I just took a 217 and I just sort
of like brushed it in some of her flaws
on her skin and it's gone and the best
thing is these dry in a really
waterproof finish so once they're on
they're on until you take them off so I
right now have the colors seven and five
so more for my deeper skin ladies four
in my kids
another Kika product is the super color
mascara and number five burgundy I used
to sell my lower lashes if I just don't
want black there or just as sometimes I
just do this on my top lashes as well
and it's just such a fun sir
way to step away from the black without
going for your typical blue or your
typical purple it's like burgundy people
another really exciting find of the
month are the lower lashes first of all
the packaging is fan-fucking-tastic
these are my favorites these are the
doll me off lashes by velour and I know
that jf loves these as well jump with us
a day here on YouTube
next I have another Kiko product caller
Vicki go crazy this is the key code
vinyl lips liquid lipstick in number one
this is just such a gorgeous light nude
coral color it's really pigmented like
for real
it is so pigmented you guys look at that
that's just like one swipe and this
little boy here cost 2 euro 50 then also
may your cat they had the Disney Store
and I bought the I'm not even gonna talk
anymore just look at that oh my god a
huge s Sulli mug my life can end now so
I got my very first pair of ray-ban
sunglasses and I'm so excited about this
I got this from sunglasses shop calm and
this is an amazing website with so many
good brands ray-ban cool of masters I've
never felt so many feels for sunglasses
I absolutely love these these have like
that perfect vintage feel they're retro
I look I love the black and the gold
together this is heaven on earth in
sunglasses category so these are the
Rabin clock masters and I got them in a
large with black and gold oh I can die
and I will put a link down below on
where you can get these and I believe
they're a little bit cheaper at some
glass shop comments awesome I get to
grow a boy favorite movie this month
well I can die three times this pickable
meets you is one of the most fun movies
I've ever seen and I cannot get enough
of these little minions they're so cute
- the best movie of 2013 by far so
enough love spread right here
channel let's go on to the Oh God knows
of July oh yeah
No so the first oh god no for July is
this on estación brow gel tinted brow
gel in blonde I do not get it I love my
Anastasia brow harder I am obsessed with
the brow powder but the brow gel I mean
come on what is going on in here it is
not pigmented it does not keep my hairs
up and it has a weird shimmer in it
making it look like you like I get
shimmery brows I love shimmery brows I
love one queen of blending doesn't
litter inner brows just not when I'm on
my neutral days why do you not keep my
hairs up why are you not like giving me
blonde bug glitter and shine damn girl
no and the last oh god no for July is
this mini eyelash curler by Mac why the
fudge that they make this I got this
because I was like well I can do like
exact eyelash curling with this I can
like do the outer half of the eyelash
region and just curl like a cat flake
curl like this is normal and then this
hurts so much when you put this on your
like eyelash first it like pushes down
like one half of your lashes then poking
in your eyeball and then the rest it
doesn't even really get into there so
you end up with like a tearing eye and
then you have like a little like weird
kink in your eyelashes so that was it
that where my hit center got notes for
the month of July I can't wait for
August because it's my mom's birthday in
August and my best friend's birthday in
August and probably a lot of people's
birthdays in August we wouldn't think I
