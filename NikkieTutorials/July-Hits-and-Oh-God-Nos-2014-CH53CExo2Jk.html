July hits enna God knows and it feels
great to be back because I've been on
holiday from last week came back this
Saturday so I've been here for a week
again of course I did some pre-recorded
video so you're like what you've been
here all the time
but I've been away and I've been to
France and I've had a super duper nice
vacation and I've really recharged I
feel like a brand new person I actually
really don't but uh isn't that what
people say when they're back from
vacation and I don't know if you can
hear something a little bit different
but I got a new mic and uh normally let
me get it in all my previous videos I
used to use this little dude right here
this is the zoom h1 handy recorder and I
love this I got this about two years ago
and I really really liked it but I
wanted to upgrade and have recently
gotten in contact with dusty Perkins
here on YouTube she's one of my all-time
favorite you to worth on here because
her videos Rock her makeup looks
absolutely amazing plus her background
and the video quality and the audio is
just perfection so I got it in contact
with her and I was like can I ask you
which microphone you use and she told me
and she helped me out so right here
right now I want to thank you Jesse for
actually helping me out and you know
what the settings and everything I
cannot believe that it's August already
I mean August before we know it it's
Halloween guys and before we know it's
Halloween it's Christmas and we're
dumping in the snow for July it was kind
of hard for me to find all my favorites
like any month and then once I do have
all the favorites collected I'm like huh
that's way too much okay so let's go
right ahead and jump into the first
favorite it's right here let's just pick
one I am going to start off with the
Becca shimmering skin perfecter I have
talked about the UM
what we took the day oh my god this is
so embarrassing
I've mentioned the-- one
and purl before and I absolutely love
this but I wanted something a little bit
warmer and not that sephora.com ships to
Holland
yes duchies sephora.com ships to the
Netherlands right now so get on that
boat so once I found out that Sephora
dicamba start shipping to us I knew that
Sephora calm has Becca so one and one is
two
Sephora Dutch shipping equals Becca so I
got the Becca shimmering skin perfecter
in opal and I'm wearing it underneath my
foundation today and it just gives you
the most amazing healthy glow I might
even go as far as saying that I like
this better than the pearl because the
pearl can be a little bit too silvery
and Stark
um compared to this so why I love both
so I want to do quickly want to mention
that mixed with the UH leblanc by chanel
these two just make the perfect glowy
finish base for underneath your
foundation it just gives you that glow
girl like you don't even know what a
glow is until you've tried this together
the next thing I want to talk about is
the NARS pure radiant tinted moisturizer
I also got this in France at Sephora and
I am actually doing a first impression
review on this now okay you just heard
me say that I did a first impression it
was on this and I've only okay this is
going to sound so hypocritic great
hypocritical I've only tried the NARS
tinted moisturizer for two days and I'm
already knowing that this is going to be
one of my all-time favorite products
it's really really comparable to Mac's
face and body it just has a touch bit
more coverage so I really like that it
gives you that really nice skin texture
glow it makes you look as if you're
glowing it still looks like you have
skin instead of a pancake on your face
so I did the first impression review
video for this yesterday but I already
know that I am going to love it I'm
wearing it today I know it's hard to
believe and I could have lied about this
by telling y'all I've used this for like
three weeks now but no I've used it for
two days and as so far I just know that
it's going to become one of my babies so
I love it okay the next product is going
to be
the you just making that work now it's
going to be the most huge shock to
everyone ever because y'all know that
the Urban Decay Naked spell ads are just
not my thing not my cup of tea I really
I let I had a period where I really
liked the first one and then the second
one I don't even want to talk about and
then months after not giving the naked3
any attention I bought it I used it and
I absolutely loved it
I'm so shocked myself as well because I
I just I'm not a big fan of the naked
palettes I do love Urban Decay as a
brand in and of itself absolutely
but like the naked palettes are not my
thing and then once I bought this and I
tried it I have fallen in love with this
you don't even want to know I am wearing
it today I just I can't understand how
the first two weren't really that much
of a hit to me and then this one is like
oh my god I love it so much so for all
of you rooting for me to love a Naked
palette it has happened and I am in love
I seriously love the Naked 3 and I'll be
doing a couple of more neutral and smoky
tutorials using this because I know you
guys want this I really do like it
next time I'm going to go on a little
bit of a pallet craze now the chocolate
bar by Too Faced I've used this in a
video for ariana grande the tutorial
this just is oh mama
it looks absolutely stunning oh I didn't
show you the inside of the Naked 3 this
is what the Naked 3 looks like on the
inside so the chocolate bar has just
amazing colors it just looks absolutely
flawless it it's got your warmer neutral
tones I got shimmery tones and got
mattes I love that it has a met and
shimmery highlighting color it's got
your deeper tones it's just I love this
palette and I know every guru here on
YouTube has said it but oh my god it
smells so divine I would
and say it smells like chocolate but it
smells good like a white chocolate
doughy cookie it's just can't you
another palette and this also is by
Urban Decay and I know you have been
waiting for me to pick this one up the
oh my can't kill it
I don't know why it has taken me so long
to get this palette because holy it
is freaking amazing I mean I'm just
going to drop the brush out now I mean
look at these colors I mean can we talk
about this this is just insane basically
when this palette came out people were
like Nicki they finally made a palette
that matches you I don't think what what
and then it was oh I get it no it's just
got the most amazing bright leaning
towards neon colors in here and I cannot
wait to show you some tutorials with
this the amazing people over at the balm
send me a huge package filled with some
of their goodies and I love the bomb I
think their packaging is one of the best
packaging in the world of makeup and I
got a couple of favorites from them the
first one is a cindy lou manizer i've
used it throughout a couple of videos
this month and it's just you got you got
mary lou manizer you got another lou
manizer but this cindy lou manizer is a
pinkish one and it is so sunny it's not
as stark and intense as mary lou manizer
and I find that Cindy illuminizer is a
great base for highlighting once you pop
it onto your skin it just it just makes
you look as if you're glowing from
within without looking like an oil slick
I think cindy lou manizer is the perfect
color for light skinned people and it's
just it's it gives you that glow from
within it has a bit of peachy pinky
sheen to it I really really like this
one
then another blush by the balm that I've
been rocking lately and I'm wearing it
on my cheeks today is down boy and I
mean look at the packaging so the color
it looks like this
it's a very cool toned mid-tone bright
pink I really like it it's great for
everyday wear because it punches up your
cheeks a bit but it's not going too far
with it so yeah down boy it's just one
of those classics that you can wear
every single day and everyone will say
oh you look good today
please say help then another highlighter
I want to talk about and again it's
going to come as a shock because it's
another MUA product that I've been
loving and MUA and I have kind of been
iffy because most of the products I
don't like but this right here this is
makeup Academy and you a undress your
skin shimmer highlighter and oh my
this is just oh God
it's actually quite comparable to cindy
lou manizer it has somewhat of the same
color i would say that cindy lou manizer
is warmer and just a little warmer but
undressed your skin I'm wearing it on my
cheekbones today so if you're wondering
what that glow on my face is its undress
to your skin I love this sort of print
they put in the powder this is super
cheap I got this for like 4 to 5 euros I
believe but it's gives you that amazing
glow again without going too far with it
oh I have another blush you guys this is
the hourglass blush and the lighting
watch in Demi fusion I've been eyeing
this bad boy forever and I finally got
it a couple of weeks ago and it's just
it's truly worth the hype
Tim infusion is a soft curly peachy pink
and it has a really nice soft shine to
it just like they're highlighting
powders and I just find it to look
absolutely stunning it makes your cheeks
look really glowy and seeing too many
glowy words it just does it just makes
your skin and your cheeks look very
glowy and healthy and like a parrot's
sodimm infusion definitely worth the
hype if you would ask me tough question
would you go for down boy would you go
for dim infusion I say combine the two
that's my remedy to everything if I have
to choose something I say combine the
two girls so that's it for
all my hits for the month of July I know
it's kinda weird to see me talk about
the naked pillow like that and all the
other stuffs but it's time for the dish
no it's not time for this how do you
call it it's time to you know throw some
dirt in the air oh yeah No so may only
oh god no this month is by L'Oreal and
L'Oreal recently came out with their
nudes line they got six lipsticks or
more inspired by the Stars and they have
like Julianne Moore JLo this other bitch
and that other bitch but they also did
one for down to coupes and das nações
is a Dutch model she's absolutely
gorgeous just you know conquering the
world and everything so this is the
Loreal collection PV by Doutzen the
color riche Doutzen noot God could it be
any longer at first this and I was like
oh my god I am going to obsess over this
color because it's light it's baby pink
it's nude it's creamy it doesn't have a
lot of shine to it and I love when a
creamy lipstick doesn't have too much of
that shimmer in it and it's just I was
like I am going to obsess over this oh
that's right you can't see it because it
sucks I mean I can keep on rubbing this
lipstick and just the tiniest faintest
the most faint sheen of color will arise
plus it smells garden I know
brands like to make their lipstick smell
fruity and but this just smells oh
no L'Oreal no so that's it guys that's
it for my hits I got notes for the month
of July I really like to light it flew
