June it's a god knows but first I want
to introduce you to a new lover of mine
say hello to Bowie say hi hi everyone
she's so tired it's so hot in Holland so
she has been swimming and she's so tired
but I want to introduce you to my
absolute hit of the month of June our
new pup Bowie I say hi to them say hi to
them hello oh you're so tired aren't you
you smile so we got Bowie about a month
ago and she's been an absolute blast and
I love her so much I treat her as my own
child she's my mom's so she's not coming
with me a rig to our apartment which was
gonna break my heart plus I've been also
treating her with the bark box the bark
box is a monthly box of goodies for your
dog and every month you get candy and
toys for your dog and I figured because
she's still such a little pup she's
grown so fast but I went really wanted
to pamper her so in the bark box this
month we got these superfood protein dog
treats please don't drop it out my boob
she's been absolutely loving this and
then also came in the bark box the oh
yeah you like that huh the red apple and
dandelion cookies and then a bunch of
toys which she has been playing with
ever since I highly recommend the barb
box for if you have a new pup or for
just if you want to show your dog some
love Plus also I got a cold front bark
box if you use the code Nicky was
toriel's you'll get one extra month on
your bark box subscription so let's say
you order for two months you will get
three months yes my next hit this month
is by hair lovey and this is the revised
deep hydration hair masque it's really
hot in Holland right now and I've been
swimming a lot in the swimming pool and
I have blonde hair so my hair really
gets a lot of damage in the swimming
pool and just in the summer overall and
this mask right here is an all natural
moisturizing and strengthening mask that
has been absolutely amazing for my heart
this month when I use this I
we feel like it's repairing my hair and
it's deep conditioning it making my hair
super soft and healthy and the best
thing about this hair mask you guys the
smell the scent of this is so amazing I
cannot even explain to you how much I
love the scent it's like this magical
blend of coconut and vanilla and just
magical unicorn poop and it's it's just
such an amazing scent and that alone
just makes this mask so amazing but also
it just makes my hair feel so good so if
you have blonde hair or just damaged
hair and you really want a deep
moisturizing and strengthening mask to
save it from summer or swimming pools or
whatever I highly highly highly
recommend this mask right here buy hair
Lizzie and it's called the reviving mask
next up I have a little bit of a
confession to make
I've been supporting a lot of natural
hair lately I've been ditching the wigs
more and more lately because I've been
really liking how my hair looks with
that mask and with this trick that I'm
about to show you people have been
commenting so much how my natural hair
has been so OnPoint and long lately but
what you guys don't know is that it is
fake it arms extension it isn't a weave
it's actually a hairpiece and this is a
hairpiece by Jennifer Hoover and it
looks like this literally it has clamps
in the center and then right here it
just gradually fades into a thinner
front portion you flick it on top of
your crown and you pin it down and
you're left with this beautiful long
full natural hair that no one can tell
it's fake I start wearing it for two to
three months straight now because I try
to weave but my scalp couldn't take it
so jennifer recommended me this and it
has been a lifesaver it's been so nice
to have lung full voluminous beautiful
hair
without anyone noticing it's fake this
is just such an amazing hair piece and
if you feel like you need that extra
oomph or if you feel like you need that
extra length and volume I highly
recommend hair pieces because they
have changed my life I'm so obsessed and
I highly recommend it to everyone in
need of good hair my next hit is by
bozhe and I've talked about this in my
previous haul and this is the makeup
breakup coal cleansing oil and so many
of you have recommended me when I asked
on Twitter what bush our products to get
and this has not disappointed whatsoever
in fact it has taken over my you know
skincare routine because this will get
your makeup off like a pro everytime I
use this to get my makeup off I am so
amazed at how easy and quick it goes
before I would have to use a cleansing
milk then follow through with a
cleansing oil then wash my face again
put a toner on it but right now all I
use this eye makeup remover and this by
bozhe and what it does it just takes all
the makeup off in one go I wash my face
put my toner on all in moisturizers and
I am done and it has saved at least two
minutes of makeup removing in my life
which is quite a big deal to me if you
have struggles getting your makeup up at
night this this is what you need next up
I really want to talk about some brushes
that I've been adoring the first one is
by makeup geek and this is the defined
crease brush and I use this in my
minions tutorial and this is so great to
naturally define your crease in a very
nice way but without it being too soft
or too harsh I find that if you want a
concentrated crease color this is the
brush for you because you have that
precision but you still have the
blending and it's just an amazing brush
I highly recommend it I love it to sort
of softly cut my crease it's such a good
brush the next two brushes are by morphe
first one i am in love with is the
morphe m4 33 I got some new morphe
brushes in my previous haul and this
brush right here has been the best
crease blending brush of life not only
is it amazing for packing on color in
the crease but it's also perfect for
blending it out I find that I can put a
nice warm Brown in my crease with this
and blend it out in one go it's just an
amazing brush and then last but not
least is the morphe 36 and I
loving this to highlight my inner
corners it's just a very good brush it's
small its tapered but still has the
definition to really pack on color on
the inner corners
yeah these three brushes have been
helping me a lot this month my next
obsession this month were the Natasha de
Nonna eyeshadow palette I don't know
what I've been doing in my life without
these but these are so amazing they all
have this sort of like beautiful
glistening glimmer shimmer to them this
color right here aluminum has been all
over my inner corners almost the entire
month I just love these palettes they're
super duper pigmented they're so pretty
the colors are amazing I mean hello and
come on trust when I say that these
palettes have been all over my eyes
lately I love them so much etosha de
Nona's work on instagram is out of this
world amazing so gets on this boat
trusts this month I started trying out a
new concealer and my life has changed no
not really
Urban Decay Naked skin concealer because
of desi because of this I have
completely ditched my mac prolongwear
concealer because I've been using that
for four years now it was with time it
was time for something else and I must
say that the naked skin concealer by
Urban Decay has been absolutely amazing
for underneath my eyes and just to rest
of my face I feel like it matches my
skin tone a little bit more the coverage
is a little bit less hardcore which I
like because it still is beautiful
so with Pro Longwear I felt like it was
like perfection on fleek almost
photoshopped a little bit too much and
with this Sun photoshopped but in a
natural way and my last hit of the month
is also the urban decay this is the
heavy metal glitter liner in Midnight
Cowboy I love this so much it's such a
beautiful gold color and it stays on so
well I have been applying this so much
on just the center of my eyelids like
with this look right now I just feel
like it needs glitter at that little
pinky spot right there a little glisten
of heavy mother glitter in Midnight
Cowboy will do this look so much justice
but I've been wearing this glitter so
much that I'm not going to today so
Midnight Cowboy or the inner corners
center of the lid
lower lashline is just an amazing
glitter that stays on all day
it's just glitter without the worries
and it's easy to get all the nights and
it's just this is my this is my cowboy
bitch so those were all my hits for the
month of June let's go on to my oh god
no oh yeah no so my only oh god no this
month is by Illamasqua and it's the gel
sculpt in silhouette this has been
marketed as contouring your face in the
most natural way possible and just
making you look defined and chiseled
without the instagram contour with
promises like that I'm like okay prove
yourself and I have tried to make this
work so many times but every time I try
it it looks like wet poo it looks like
this on my face
it creates little chunks of poo colored
gel it accentuates hairs on your face
because every hair on my hand right now
is darker than the rest of the gel I
feel like it seeps into pores making the
pores look darker than the overall look
is just a really not so pretty product
and I feel like it just it looks like
mud mixed with poo on the face I love
Illamasqua so much as a brand I love
their vision I love most of their
products but with this one I'm like what
were you guys doing and not only that
but if after like 13 hours of blending
in and making this look seamless and
beautiful it will transfer and start
patching in just a couple of hours it's
just not worth the money it's just not
pretty it just looks like mud and poo is
just not a product for you know again I
love illamasqua love their products but
this was just a huge miss for me so
that's it guys that were my hits and God
knows for the month of June what were
yours let me know here on the comments
