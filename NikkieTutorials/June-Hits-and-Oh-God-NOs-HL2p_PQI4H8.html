so today I am here to bring you my June
hits a know God knows and I am gonna be
another cliche guru on YouTube right now
where did June go
so July is upon us and today I'm here to
show you my June hits and Oh God knows
and June was amazing I did amazing work
for my actual makeup artist and hair
artist life I worked on a TV show here
in Holland that will air in fall I can't
tell you anything else about it
I was chef the cabin which sort of means
like the leader of a fashion show of a
makeup team for like 260 models in The
Hague I was a chef to convene so it was
sort of like the leader like the main
person and I felt so amazing doing that
and oh my god what happened in the last
four years where I just started like
doing legs of models and I'm like a
leader chef de cadena so that's huge
plus I also did a milk a chocolate sort
of campaign I'm gonna be honest the
video turned out to be quite awkward
very awkward my dream of ever becoming
an actress just wiped out by that video
but I love the experience so I just
wanted to share that video with you
so enough blabber on to the hits of June
so the first hit this month it's by
Poppa Milano and this is a new Arden
mania luxury French sets what poopa
Milano does a lot is new art sets and
this is one of them this is number six
in luxury French and this is stunning
because this set includes two polishes
including a met sort of ivory white
color matte keep that in mind and then a
rose gold shimmering color for on top
now what they want you to do with this
is use the ivory matte color as a base
and use the shiny rose gold color as a
French manicure or you can totally
twistings up and do half and half or
like vertical half and half you can do
anything but the color combination
this matte ivory with rose gold is
gorgeous I mean I only got this this
morning and I'm already in love with it
I can't wait to slather in this all over
my nails another product by Poppa Milano
is this silk touch compact powder in
number one I also only got this this
morning and I used it today and I'm in
absolute love with it it is such a good
compact powder it's light it's as light
as my skin tone and I'm like milk and
this is sunny
it just completely mats out your face it
takes all the shine away but in a really
nice sort of satin finish it is quite
pigmented so if you have like a pimple
and you covered it up with concealer and
still not really covered up put this
powder on top and gone with the pimple
Jun has been all about nail polish for
me and nails and cuticles and sort of
taking care of your nails and cuticles
and everything let them have polish
Christina her website is the best ever
like her nails watches are orgasmic
second of all
Christina herself is the sweetest person
ever because my cuticles and my nails
are sort of like a disaster and I needed
help
I was desperate for help and there was
Christina so we sent her private message
on Twitter like hey help me out below
bah-bah-bah she helped me out with
everything lighting for swatch pictures
how to take care of your cuticles her
nail care routine how to apply polishes
how to clean polishes when it floods the
cuticles she taught me everything in
about two days it's insane how much I
love her and how thankful I am of her
Christina thank you so much for your
help and please guys go check out let
them have polish calm amazing website
the lemony flutter by lush probably the
best cuticle oil ever that brings me to
two nail polishes I've been loving these
are from the new China Glaze
a sudden station election it's I believe
it's their summer collection and they
have a like a part jellies and in part
creams and these are the creams and the
two colors I absolutely adore are none
of
Shh and neon on and on this is sort of
like if you ever wanted a like neon
pastel color on your nails
these aren't attuned to go for the son
of a peach it's like the me honest
corylus peachy sherbert color and neon
on and on and on is just amazing so
bright yet soft and feminine and girly I
will have a blog post review with alt
swatches of that collection from China
Glaze up on my blog soon I already did
the OPI San Francisco collection all the
colors put them on my nails let's watch
them put it on a blog I will put the
link down below check that out I put so
much work in that blog post from as you
see I love the elite are stained glosses
I have a crush on these because I'm
wearing one today and the one I'm
wearing today is called androgen
androgen they literally look like a
stained glass it looked like a stain II
color with a lot of gloss and it's just
so natural and I love these these are
perfect for summer and routine is a huge
favorite and then another one that I
love is new ways and I wore this in my
previous video in a hall and just all of
these things haces by OCC are perfection
then Chanel launched a new sort of I
pencil these are the stylo eye shadow
fresh effect eyeshadow eyeshadows wow it
went too fast there so they launched
their fresh effect eyeshadows and this
is number oh seven Moon River and this
is a gorgeous topi glittery gray color
and the best thing is about these is
they feel wet it feels like you're
actually dripping water wherever you
apply it I use this on a lot of trauma
cups this year I love it to use on
myself for daily game day leave anywhere
and the best thing is that once they set
they are set and they're they're not
order prove I would not say they're what
a proof they are really long lasting
another huge favorite this month was my
Bed Head TIGI masterpiece mostest
showing hah sprite oh goody my love for
this hairspray is indescribable the
smell of this
you guys in my rainbow tag colors of the
rainbow egg it's like sugar sugar cotton
candy apples or something and I love the
packaging it sort of looks like a dildo
but I don't care three session favorites
this month aren't my screaming Simpsons
dressed by wrong we calm this sold-out
really fast after my video so that like
that means a lot to me because you guys
might have bought it because of me I
don't know if they're bringing it back I
hope so because I just wish that
everyone in the world has one of these
but they have a smiling Simpsons one as
well where you just have Bart
going like this another your favorite is
my chameleon mermaid leggings by Black
Milk
holy Kamali on a biscuit I do not
have words for this it is the most
stunning piece of legging ever and then
of course the Queen of Hearts cart
leggings like Black Milk as well which
the front are the Queen of Hearts and
then the back is an actual card
I love Black Milk out leggings they are
expensive but I love them and they're
sort of like my monthly treat to myself
well not monthly I buy like three in
like half a year or something so those
were all my hits this month let's go on
to the yoga oh yeah No first oh god no
this month is by Mac prep and prime and
this is healthy skin smoother I hate
this I don't know what Mac was
thinking with this but it's like chalky
melted into a pot it is sort of like
this plasticky like you see it's sort of
going round a silicon Chucky sort of
depotted in pot smoother what Mac is
trying to do with this is make you use
this on your skin and sort of like like
fill up two wide pores or you have like
a scar like an indent in your face or
something and then you can smooth it
over if you put this over your pores
it's gonna clog like hell
zits in ten minutes it smells like a
plastic hell and it's slippery as fudge
I try to you
the base underneath my carnation and
everything I was just keep blending the
foundation it but it didn't want to
blend in because this was like like
moving it all around and I hate this
damn girl no going back to Papa Milano
this is the professionals BB cream +
primer first things first
I hate BB creams I hate them all I just
don't like BB creams they're just not my
thing
hope I decided to come out with a BB
cream + primer like 2 years after the
trend and - just all BB creams in a
nutshell hate them hate this one I'm
sorry poo pile of poop abut the BB
creams gotta stop like just all BB
creams and a CC could like one our
brands doing we have BB creams we have
CC cream to our necks dd creams ZZ
creams pipi creams so that concludes my
