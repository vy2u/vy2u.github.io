synagogue knows it has time the month is
over and it's time for my Hitler God
knows I cannot tell you how fast June
went by skip that because every guru is
telling you that right now so I'm not
gonna I'm glad I just did but I'm not
gonna repeat myself first hit of course
this month is my special my fashionista
magazine this is my makeup by
nikkietutorials special I did a full
video on it I just scratched my face
with this attacking myself with myself I
did it full videos on this on how this
came to life and what is in this special
I've gotten a lot of tweets and
instagrams and please book messages that
you guys have ordered this or that you
have bought it in Dutch stores or
Belgium stores and I am so so proud that
people are actually running out and
getting this special I am so proud of
this baby I am so thankful for your
support and that you're actually running
out and getting this one I do want to
say though that I did not know that
people could get this internationally as
well the link provided in the info box
plus add the link in that video which
where I'm talking about this one the
link right there does ship
internationally it is however a Dutch
website so you have to use Google
Translate to kind of you know know
what's going on there but that website
does ship internationally so if you
really want to get this special which it
would mean the world to me if you if you
ordered if if you you know if you're
buying it that would mean the absolute
world to me because that way fashionista
can see that this is a success and maybe
we can do in volume 2 or whatever I
don't know I also do quickly want to
mention that if you don't want to order
it or you can get it you can get the
iPad app unfortunately its iPads only um
trust me a lot of money went into making
it and you know making more apps was
just a fortune that we could not pay
other than that if this can be all worth
and it's my greatest hit of the entire
year
ha let's go on to actual makeup products
shall we I want to talk about the stigma
pellets I got these in the beginning of
the month and ever since I tried them
out I
in love I used them on photo shoots I
used them on myself I just I used them
for everyone basically and these pellets
are the warm neutrals this is what the
warm neutrals look like it's just your
perfect it has the perfect mix of mattes
shimmers Velvets you know and just all
warm tones and you know I love my warm
tone so this is absolutely stunning and
then it's little sister smokescreen is
another palette and this is more like
cool toned colors and if you ask me
which of the two should definitely get
it's very easy if you're a cool tone
person get smokescreen if you're a warm
tone person get warm neutrals another
palette I've been absolutely obsessing
over is buy solve bucks and this is the
a tude palette I mentioned this in a
hall I recently did and it's just your
your basic neutrals heaven I am gonna
say though that I love this more than
just take my ones this just I have no
words I love it so much
I did a full on a blog post review on
this baby like with swatches and then I
look and what I think about it and in
that review I talk about every shadow
what I think of it what I don't like
about it what did you like about it I
love this palette though and I just want
to mention that I love the founders to
creators of saws books it's a mother and
a daughter and they created this company
with each other and they wanted to
create something original and different
and I think they did so well I love the
packaging and just a spirit behind this
company is so inspirational and so you
know it's you just wish nothing but the
best for these two ladies so I am
happily willing to support their company
when a pallet is so good so definitely
go check out my review and then
definitely go check out Saul's box on
its own I want to talk about two makeup
brushes that I have been obsessing over
because they have changed my entire
makeup routine you know this one is
coming I'm going to talk about the Sigma
tapered kabuki
f-86 I got this because of Jaclyn hill
of course I have talked about this brush
in so many videos recently this month
because I got it I want to try it I want
to test it out to see if Jaclyn was
right and as you know I am someone who
truly believes in honesty just watch my
benefit review on the they're real liner
so I got the f-86 thinking hmm it's
whatever jackal is saying even true so I
immediately the date that they came in I
tried him out and I I was kind of like
okay this is so different than my Real
Techniques sponge but I am liking it so
I tried it the next day and the day
after that and I am loved with this
technique it does wonders for your
liquid foundation and concealer life and
whenever I really like a brush I wanted
to work on others as well so I had about
eight photo shoots this month big photo
shoots like campaigns for like big you
know companies and I was like I'm gonna
try it out I left my sponges my Beauty
Blender is my Real Techniques sponge as
I left them at the house and I only
brought the f-86 to do the concealer
work with perfection the next part I
want to talk about is by makeup geek and
this is another favorite that you could
have seen this month so many times
throughout my videos it's the phonation
stippling brush by makeup geek already
told you that this just bust in your
foundation so nicely the hairs at this
bar so sort of a mix between synthetic
and natural making the appliance really
really beautiful like like beautiful and
just watch about every tutorial I did
this month of June and you will see this
baby pop out because it is fantastic
then it's time for some eye pencils and
eyeliners the first ones I want to talk
about are by essence and essence is one
amazing cheap brand here in Holland I
think you can get it in Australia and in
some parts of the states but I'm not
sure and what essence did is they were
like we need some dupes for the Smashbox
always sharp pencils because those rock
everyone's socks off
and when I bumped into these essence
long lasting eye pencils and tried them
out for the first time I just knew that
there were going to be my best friends
from now on so this is the essence
long-lasting eye pencil in black fever
which is the black as you said a couple
of times throughout this month of June
so you could just watch all the
tutorials and see it but it's awesome
it's just as pigmented and amazing and
it says just as
on in the waterline SD Smashbox always
sharp said that's a very good thing then
I also got the dark brown which is
called hot chocolate I also got this
sort of berry color this is berry
Mary and I also got this shimmering
bronze which is called hot scorch and I
just can tell you that these pencils are
so so so good they stay on your
waterline so well every gel eyeliner I
have found my new love I did a full
review on this on my blog as well a
couple of weeks ago and this is the
L'Oreal gel intenta eyeliner in pure
black but and this is just L'Oreal's
version of a gel eyeliner and it is damn
good girl it is for me better than the
illamasqua one I like it better than the
Maybelline one I even like it better
than the Mac one because the Mequon
tends to dry out a little bit faster
than this one it's cheap it's amazing
and go check out my review if you want
to see more about this bad boy next I
want to talk about it is a and you a
product um I've talked about anyway
products a lot on my channel and on my
blog
mostly negatively because they never
really seem to do it for me except for a
couple of lipsticks I just kind of gave
up on anyway because I just I didn't
feel that love connection you know
coming anytime soon until I found this
shade number four blusher and I used it
in my Kelly Osbourne makeup tutorial and
I loved it so much it's so peachy it's
so Orange E and bright and it's so happy
it's such a happy color I'm actually
wearing it really softly on my cheeks
today and it's just that perfect you
know just mix of happy Paige it did fix
the smells but is because it's such a
happy color another product I've been
loving this month and has been talked
about a lot on YouTube are the whitening
lightening color your smell lip glosses
I got all colors from lightning
lightning themselves and I'm so thankful
for that and I tried them out I did some
testing and I really do like them the
best thing about them is when you
unscrew the lid it actually has a light
in the lid like if I show you there's
Lord and I just love the colors they
vary from bright blues to gray lavenders
to darks
to blacks to whites to nudes to
shimmering goodnesses they have
basically every color you want and my
two favorites this month are the sugar
mama which is what I'm wearing on my
lips today it's a very cool tone nude
bubblegum pink which I really really
like and then another favorite is coral
crazed it's the perfect coral peachy
sort of lip gloss color I am planning a
full-on review video on these where I
apply all the colors to my lips and you
can just see them in action and how they
work and how pigmented they are and
everything and I have that planned for
this month actually so watch out for
that before in our sugar mama and color
craze are perfection the last head I
want to talk about is by Victoria Secret
and this is a fragrance mist this the
equivalent of like the body splashes I
thought this so randomly and like one of
our drugstores here in Holland I was
with it looks by Sharron and we just did
some really really like quick shopping
and we bumped into the Victoria's Secret
fragrance mist and this is midnight
exotics deep berry it's not really a
perfume it's not really a body splash is
right in between so it lingers a little
bit longer around you than a body splash
would but it definitely doesn't have the
staying power that a fragrance of
perfume has but that kind of makes it
like crack because you want to keep
spraying it all over your body every 10
minutes
I don't know how available this is in
your countries but let me tell you if
you bump into Victoria's Secret midnight
exotics body mist get on that boat so
that's it for all my hits this month
I loved my hits this month they were so
um different from what I normally show
you guys so that's that's let's go on to
them God knows I know that's what you're
waiting for
oh yeah no the Chanel low volume
waterproof mascara I bought it because
everyone was raving about the Chanel low
volume waterproof mascara
I was like if everyone is raving about
it that much it has to be good so I went
out and I bought it and I tried it on
and as you guys know I have really tough
lashes to work with they do hold curl
from my curling iron but once I put
mascara on it that's too heavy or just
doesn't you know have the right formula
they droop down and it look really sad
and weird so I was like okay it's Chanel
it's low volume it's waterproof I always
always use waterproof mascaras because
they hold that curl and I put this on
expecting to have the best lashes in the
world and like after 10 seconds they
went from like stop trying so thank you

list of every single product mentioned
