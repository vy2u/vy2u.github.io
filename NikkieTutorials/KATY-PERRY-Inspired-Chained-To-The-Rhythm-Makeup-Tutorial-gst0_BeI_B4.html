Katy Perry launched her new music video
for chained to the rhythm and I've been
such like honestly I've been I've been
living for this song I've been hardcore
loving this song and knowing Katy Perry
she always brings her a-game for music
videos and miss Perry always wears crazy
fun makeup and today in her music video
she had this like mint blue eye soft
pink lips and a glow honey and she looks
so so fabulous so I am beyond excited to
show you a makeup tutorial inspired by
one of your looks today not like I said
I feel like a cotton candy dream today
so I am so excited for this look we're
going to play with some color and we're
going to play with glow and it's just
going to be so much fun so without any
further ado if you would like to know
how to get this Katy Perry look right
here and then keep on watching already
mama needs her hydration so I'm going to
go in with my ELF prep and hydrate balm
stick this if you have dry skin I said
it before I'll say it again if you have
dry skin this is oh my god so good
as a primary today though in with this
right here by Sicily this is called the
double pen sulla instant and long-term
primer I really like how this give me
hydration plus it has a really really
almost strong stickiness to it which I
love because that's really going to
cling that foundation on to it and make
sure you kind of tap it until you feel
it becoming tacky and sticky that's when
you know it's time for foundation so let
me just quickly add my pure identity
before we actually move on to the
foundation since I cannot live without
this stuff for foundation today I'm
first going to go in with the hourglass
vanish foundation stick in porcelain
first oh yes create nice patterns on our
face and then with the new Sigma 3d HD
Blender sponge I'm going to buff this
into my face I don't look like to you
this is going to be too small for me I
like this I like I like the but we're
really like the but now this foundation
is one of those foundations
that will give you flawless Photoshop
skin like it legit looks like someone
went facing crazy on your face when you
wear this foundation it is everything
I'm really liking the sponge so far it
is blending in the foundation
beautifully I like how it has a little
bit more of a like fabric texture as
opposed to the Beauty Blender the Beauty
Blender is really smooth so texture wise
like fabric texture wise like the morphe
sponges are ultra ultra smooth the
regular Beauty Blender is smooth and
this is like it feels a little bit more
like fabric and I feel like that is
amazing for foundation like it just
gives you that coverage it just blends
it and without any effort I'm really
liking this one so far but as I like to
do with any sponge I like to kind of
reactivate the moisture using some Evian
spray to kind of make it all damp again
or
for concealer I do a little bit because
the foundation already is so full
coverage and intense and Katie does love
her you know her makeup and I love that
about Katie that she always wears Bob as
the lux I would be so happy but this
foundation is pretty damn intense so I'm
going to go a little lighter on
concealer all right so that is looking
absolutely smooth and flawless so now
we're going to set it and bake to make
sure it doesn't go anywhere to ensure
that the blue on our eyes pops like no
other and stays on all day I'm applying
a primer to my lid I'm going to make
this blue and sort of mint shade from
the sugarpill eyes shadow palette and
this is going right in my crease and
winging it out and this combination is a
little darker than Katie had on but I
like going in with this first for
definition and then we're going to
lighten it let me tell you it feels
super super work to be going in with
such a bright color in your crease and
basically just look is going to look
like crap until you put on the lashes
but if at any point you're like oh my
god what did I get myself into wait till
the lashes it pulls it all together and
it was funny
now using the same brush same colors
applying that to a village and like I
mentioned now it's time for a lighter
touch of blue this color is by
Illamasqua I've had this shadow
literally for ages so the name rubbed
off but I'll put it in my description
box below with this mix in with a little
bit of white eye shadow right in the
crease and because you add in that white
with the shadow it's going to act as an
amazing transition color but also give
you that pop of brightness Katy wasn't
just wearing simple blue shadow on her
eyes they also added a little bit of
definition on the outer corner so I'm
going in with this gray color by makeup
geek called self and really lightly I'm
applying this to the outer corner
blending in with the blue and of course
weighing it out I'm gonna go in with
this frosted highlight by Meraki
cosmetics this is in the color key own
and this is going on the inner corners
and brow bone so working my way up into
the blue
and I do want to add a little pop of
shimmer and glitter so going in with the
Mack reflex pearl right on that inner
corner to the line even more with a
little bit of the beige shadow and some
black I'm slightly defining the lower
lash line right on the center then right
on the inner corner of the lower lash
line I'm also applying some of that
shiny pigment quickly applying white
close to my waterline to open up my eyes
and to give your lower lashes a fuller
look I'm placing the tiniest dots on my
lower lash line for our fullness and
like I said to really pull this look
together we need some lashes and I'm
going to go in with my Lillie lashes
volley lashes
pratik skatey captain a softer but still
very very glowy and healthy-looking so
there was a contour but it was softer
and there was blush but it was softer
and there was a glow and it wasn't soft
it was it was bright but it made me so
happy so I'm going to give my face a
little bit of shape using my road I'll
glam contour powder in number three and
two
so a warmer shade and a cooler shade to
warm up my face but also contour my face
with stuff
for blacks I'm going to use a dis blush
by covergirl in the color oh it is
called trublend blush in the color light
rose 100 and I'm focusing this more up
and on the outside of my face it wasn't
necessarily here I felt like her blush
and like highlight and contour placement
is very much like here
Katy's glow also have just like pinky
touch to it it had this like pink
luminance don't obsess a word but I'm
going to go in with this highlighter
right here awesome I got my lenses this
is my makeup forever it is the pro light
fusion in number one it is super
blinding but it has that like pinky
touch to it which goes perfectly with
this look and they would hand on the
highlight they would ham
alright and for lips we're looking at a
pinky glossy nude which I feel like give
the not to like an 80s look but it's
like it's a good 80s look it's like a
modern 80s look at them just look sober
go go in with the colour-pop ultra satin
lip in the color for ribs spreads us for
its grip and then that is a little bit
too colorful so I'm going to go in with
a nude lipstick to tone it down and then
over top a little bit of a gloss
this is Veggie way and it is called a
cereal
alright let's set this bad boy into
place with some setting spray and we're
done
and that guy's concludes my Katy Perry
chained to the rhythm music video
