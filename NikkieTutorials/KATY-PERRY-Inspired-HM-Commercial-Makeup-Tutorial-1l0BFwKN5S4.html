inspired by Katy Perry's new Christmas
commercial for H&amp;amp;M and of course I'm
talking about the fairy look because the
fairy look got floated the best look on
my Twitter ad nikkietutorials
so I asked everyone on Twitter okay do
we want to see the bronzy red lip look
or do we want to see the fairy look and
the fairy look one by far and I'm
excited at one because it was my
favorite and it's so much fun and
finally we're playing with a little bit
of color on my channel again today so I
did give it a little bit of my own spin
this is inspired by it not recreated
either way I hope you enjoy and let's
get ready for some color alright the
first thing I'll be doing is priming my
face using my Nivea men aftershave balm
and this to keep my face looking
flawless all day for a foundation today
I'm going to go for that ultra flawless
finish because
Katy Perry and I'll be using the Make Up
For Ever Ultra HD foundation sticks and
I'm using the colours 120 for the outer
portion of my face and 117 for the inner
portion and that will give you a really
nice natural contoured field so first
I'm going to use 120 on the outer
portions of my base and then 117 on the
inner portion and then blend in using a
Beauty Blender I said it before I'll say
it again I am obsessed with these
foundations for concealer I'll be using
my it cosmetics bye bye under-eye in
light
and again just blend in using your
Beautyblender
and quickly setting everything with
powder to prevent it from creasing the
first thing I'll be using as always is
my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot to prime my
eyelids and there isn't a
nikkietutorials video when there's not
at least one broken nail and I'm buffing
this in using a sigma 3d HD precision
brush as always I'm now setting my
crease and brow bone area using a matte
cream eyeshadow now it's time to cut the
crease and for this I'm taking my Urban
Decay Gwen Stefani eyeshadow palette and
I'm taking the color Anaheim and I'm
using a Sonia Kashuk number 27 brush for
this
you
now with a sigma e45 with that same
color blended out above the line and
then with a morphe mb 23
I blend that out even more now it's time
to focus on the lid the beautiful
rainbow lid first eyeshadow will be
going in with is by makeup geek and this
is voltage and this is going on the
inner third and you want this to go all
the way up to that cut crease and then
even a little bit above it so you still
get that depth from the cut crease but
the color from the rainbow now be using
NYX prismatic eyeshadow in mermaid and
mixing it with makeup geeks Pegasus and
this is going on the center of the lid
using a Mac 239
for the purple I'll be using makeup
geeks carnival and mixing it with makeup
geeks daydreamer and this of course is
going on the outer third and blending
into the crease
and I'm just going to go back in with
all the colors and Riaan tents apply
them
I'll be highlighting my inner corner and
brow bone using this Urban Decay eye
shadow in cosmic and I'm using a is the
wave at 2:26 for this alright we're
almost done with the eye shadow work now
let's go back into Anaheim the same
color that's in our crease and that is
going on our lower lash line now going
in with Sirius and that to add more
define Minh to the outer corners for
that fun winged liner at first going in
using my cavity ink liner in trooper
you
and then fill it all in using my line
8th in legend by Sigma I want to do now
is go crazy with some glitters these are
by Urban Decay the silver one is called
glam rock and the iridescent one is
called Distortion
and the silver is going on my inner
corners and the iridescent one on my lid
the lashes I'll be using two there are
by house of lashes and these are the
noir fairy black and I'll also be
applying some bottom lashes they are
precious by house of lashes I can show
you them right now cuz they look busted
all right on to cheeks for the cheeks I
first got to do some light contouring I
needed for this going to use the Alaric
Pro contour palette and of course I'll
be using the lightest one because my is
paper and for this up using the elf
blush brush and just add a little bit of
cheek to your face and then with a big
brush blend it all in so there are no
traces of fake bones for a highlighter
I'm once again going into my Anasazi
Beverly Hills illuminator in starlight
and mixing it with this Urban Decay
Naked illuminated highlighter in
luminous and this is so freakin sparkly
which is exactly what we want cuz she
was a fairy Katy with a fairy so oh the
highlighter on the face and for this
I'll be using a sigma f o3 brush
welcome highlighter Bienvenue
I'm also highlighting the tip of my nose
cupids bow and right above the arch of
my brow every tiny bit of blush I'll be
using the Sigma or a powder in lady
slipper and the Sigma f30 7 brush
i lastly spray with the Urban Decay all
nighter makeup setting spray a little
bit more for lips I first going to go in
with this Too Faced melted lipstick and
this is in the color melted marshmallow
