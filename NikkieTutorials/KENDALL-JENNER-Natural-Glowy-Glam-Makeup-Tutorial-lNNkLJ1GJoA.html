on this makeup look right here I wanted
to create something super summery
intensely glowing very sexy bombshell E
goddess II all inspired by kendall
Jenner
I think kendall has this amazing natural
glowing goddess touch to her which I
don't I know it's sad I've learned to
live with it and I really wanted to
mimic her natural glowing goddess glam
Ness so I went in with all the shiny
products today and I think this is super
wearable I love my globe but you can
always take down the glow a little bit
and make it even more wearable I love
this it's all neutral tones and super
glowy super glam so if you would like to
know how to get this makeup look right
here then keep on watching alright so I
already went ahead and moisturized my
face using the benefit total moisture
moisturizing cream I am really loving
this stuff to kind of moisturize before
makeup now quickly gonna go in with
these your leaked
oh god probably butchered that rose
water balancing mist and this just you
give me a little bit extra moisture and
you just you know it's got rosewater and
I love rosewater for skincare for
foundation today I'm first gonna go in
with the D your skin air flash spray
foundation in number 100 and I'm going
to spray it onto my morphe beauty sponge
I've tried the whole spring it on your
face and it for me just guess everywhere
it gets my clothes gets in my hair at
one point I even felt like it
accentuated my nose hair so know step
first you want to give it a shake and
then now I'm going to spray it onto my
morphe Beauty Blender this is my first
time trying it out so let's see how it
goes
and apply and this will give you a very
minimum weight of foundation on your
face but it's still nicely balances it
out see how that's super lightweight and
totally doesn't cover anything at all
who am i I'm not like this I need more
well it is beautiful if you want to go
for a really light coverage barely-there
makeup look this technique right here
Bom
okay now in areas where you think you
need it you can go in with a more
coverage foundation I'm going to go for
the Tom Ford my first time trying it
this is the Tom Ford traceless
foundation stick now for me personally
jawline tops of cheekbones
alright so switching back to a Beauty
Blender to see if I notice a difference
and bouncing that traceless foundation
stick my tongue forward into my skin I
don't know guys I think it's pretty damn
identical as far as what the sponge is
due to my foundation for concealer I'm
going to go in with the colour-pop
sculpting sticks in gummy bear and mix
it with Tarte shave tape concealer in
fair
with this we're going to give ourselves
a very highlighted glow from within look
and now with my NARS powder in snow I'm
going to bake the under eye area
all right and that's just that the rest
of my face I'd give it a really cool
airbrushed finish I'm going to go into
my chanel whose powder and Claire and my
morphe tube brush and I learned this
technique from Alissa Ashley here on
YouTube and just pick up a lot of powder
really pounded on the face and then
brush away the excessive amount of
powder and you're left with like
airbrushed flawless skin just like
Kendall
and since I'm so fair I want to
highlight my under eye area so after
going with straight of white and this is
the Mac Studio Fix pastel in Shivering
white and I'm going to apply that to my
under eye area with my morphe e49
and with this you also brush away the
Bakke and you're left with beautiful
highlighted under eyes that look crazy
right now but in the end once you have
your bronzer contour blush highlighter
on it all just melts it together and
it's amazing your eyes the first thing
I'm going to do is of course Prime and
I'm going to use my soft ochre Paint Pot
by a Mac with more face porcelain
eyeshadow in my Mac 252 brush I'm just
gonna set my brow bone in crease area to
help lending later on and I know this
cuts messy now going in with the morphe
12 and beef palette and taking this
color right here for my crease and
softly defining my crease using my
morphe M 504 brush I'm mostly going to
keep the shape of the eyeshadow very
rounded and true to my natural eye shape
so normally I kind of drag it out here
not today today we're just going to
follow the shape of her natural eye just
define it definitely don't want anything
too harsh
just a soft definition to enhance our
crease for the inner and outer corners
of the lid and we'll go in with color
brain Kumi and applying it using a luxe
e23 9 brush
and on the center fill that I'll be
applying coloured raine glamour
eyeshadow
for the lower lash number exactly going
to mimic what we did on top so I'm first
going in with that morphe palette to
define using a matte color then going
over top using who me by color brain and
of course on the center glamour on the
center of the lid I'm applying a little
bit of the NIC studio liquid liner in
extreme pink just to Yuri intensify that
Center highlight a little bit to open up
my eyes on the waterline I'll be
applying these two for colorful shadow
and liner in matte white to highlight
the inner corner I'm not taking that
same pencil by Sephora but this time and
shimmer white and putting this self
first as the base and setting that using
color rain clutch pearls
to finish all you want to do is the
place of flirty false lashes these are
Lily lashes in the style Miami and
especially Kylie Jenner loves the B's
Miami lashes so that's why I'm using
them today
all right let's move on to cheeks now
Kendall of course has amazing bone
structure I don't so I'm going to mimic
that by contouring and I'll be using my
break-up contour powder by makeup geek
and my contouring brush today is morphe
and 5:30 now with my zoeva 142 pick up a
little bit more of breakup contour
powder and apply right at the base to
sharpen it even more and then with some
face powder go right underneath to clean
up and even tap at the contour itself to
soften it and that way you have an
immaculate contour Kendall is an
absolute bronzy bombshell so I have to
bronze up this fair as right here so
I'll be using the Charlotte Tilbury
film-star bronze &amp;amp; Glow and underneath
the bronzing part with a fluffy large
brush to not make it too concentrated
and I'm just kind of slightly bronze and
warm up the high points of my face to
mimic the beautiful bombshell bronze
enos for blush gonna use this to face
sweetheart blush in the color candy glow
and the brush we'll be using for this is
a morphe M 5:09
and with this I'm also going to warm up
my forehead jaw area and tip of nose
Kendall also always has an amazing glow
so first I'm going to try something new
I'm going to go in with the cover FX
custom enhancer drops in celestial and
I'm going to bounce this on my
highlighting areas and then go over top
with a powder highlight - boom everyone
so I'm picking some up using my Beauty
Blender and now I'm going over top of my
base and quickly as it's still wet go
over top of my highlighter today I'm
using my sleek Solstice palette and boom
baby boom
and I'm going to highlight the entire
bridge of my nose because that is what
Kendall has all over the nose and then
also highlighting right above my brows
onto the forehead a little bit tiny bit
on the chin all right now for ellipse
the key is to keep it super super nude
and almost mimic your skin tone what I
love about Kendall's nudes are that
they're super super close to her skin
tones therefore drawing all the
attention to our beautiful glowing skin
and flirty eyes I'm going to go in with
the new de Vanille uh Tom for lipstick
today this is beautiful and then for the
tiniest bit of gloss I'm going to mix
the Tom Ford gloss in naked with this
hot makeup gloss right here called
castle
and to lock it all in place of course
some setting spray and I'll be using
Urban Decay chill and that guys
