channel to talk about the following the
brand new k'kaw beauty highlight and
contour powder kits and I am so excited
about this video today because I
actually played with this already on Kim
kardashian-west herself if you follow me
on social media you know that a couple
of weeks ago I had the huge honor of
doing Kim's makeup for a video and for
all of you wondering where that video is
this up for review right now Kim and her
team have to like go through it and
approve it and as soon as they approve
it it's going live on my channel so
definitely click on the notification
bell below to get a notification for
once it goes up but for today we're
going to be focusing on the brand new
powder highlight and contour kit I
definitely feel so blessed and I'm so
thankful that Kim trusted me enough to
let me try it out on her for that video
so this is not my first time trying this
palette so I kind of know what it looks
like how it works Kim let me try her
only sample that she had sometimes
samples are a little bit better than the
actual outcome finished product so I'm
hoping that in today's video we're going
to find out that it is exactly the same
I know there has been a little
controversy with her swatching them but
I can tell you Kim Kardashian is the
worst water of life don't kill me Kris
so without any further ado let's go
right on ahead to this review so I
swatch it / kind of first impressions
because it's the first time trying to
kid out on my face so let's do it
alright so I bar you in a little bit
closer and let's take a closer look at
the palettes as well so in the k'kaw
powder contour and highlight kit you get
two beautifully blending highlighters a
bronzer and a contour shade when looking
at the light kit we see a more champagne
golden glow a more pinky peach glow a
very warm bronzer and a more gray toned
contour shade looking at the medium kit
we see a more yellow toned golden
highlight again a more peachy tone but a
little bit more warm highlight and even
warmer bronzer and a more cool toned
contour shade as well as for the
dark deep dark it we have everything
just darker and more warm and intense
also a little secret I'm wearing the
dark slash deep dark set on my eyes
today so everything you see on my eyes
today is this kid right here
sometimes I literally have to skin tone
of paper I feel most comfortable going
with the light kit today and you know I
have a couple of opinions about this one
I'm going to let you in on a little
secret and I actually have no idea if
I'm allowed to share this with you but
I'm just gonna so when meeting Kim she
was a little late and she walked in and
she was like I'm so sorry we were
finishing up on powders like the colors
and texture she said she was basically
rounding up the contour and highlight
powder kids and she showed me the colors
for the fair kit and the first thing I
said to her was Kim from bottom of my
heart rusted from this pasty trusted for
me your bronzer is too warm so I gave
her a couple of recommendations on which
browsers work for my skin tone and she
said that she would look into it and
that she was so thankful for that advice
and that maybe she was going to change
the powder she didn't and I never
expected her to because you know she was
probably hitting her deadline and it had
to be done but I will say right off the
bat this bronzer is going to be too warm
and intense for a lot of fair skin tone
people out there I mean I'm
foreshadowing a little bit I haven't
tried it on my face yet but from
experience I know that warm bronzers
like that look like crush on my skin
anyway so I'm going to be focusing on
the light kit today and I'm going to
start off with the poser
now what the Asajj also comes a new
brush this brush is so much better than
the previous brush I didn't remind the
previous brush the sponge part was
ridiculous I'm sorry for this verse
however we see a more slanted contour
side and when you flip it over it's a
more dome shaped blush highlighter sides
they're definitely nice and dense but
nothing to stick or like a I feel like
the contour set it's going to be a
little bit too packed and to dance for
my contouring because it's going to be
it's going to apply just I need to stop
with the foreshadowing and just applied
too
got bare face I will definitely be
trying out the brush for the contouring
and highlighting but for the bronzer
because it is so intense and warm and
I'm going with my trust brush my benefit
because I don't want to look like a mess
so dipping the brush into the powder I
can already tell that it picks up a lot
of it okay here we go is bronze
okay so it is definitely adding warmth
I literally applied the softest thinnest
layer of the bronzer and I already feel
like it is leaning a little muddy and
it's just too warm it's too warm this
will be beautiful decrease or a nice
transition color next crease color as
bronzer on the cheeks it's too warm and
you also got to make sure that you tap
it off and get as little on your brush
because this stuff is pigmented like the
tiniest bit will cover the cheeks easily
okay but why am I liking this site
better why doesn't it look that on this
side down oh my god okay I am going to
go it was a little bit of face powder to
Tom the warmth down just a smidge okay
that's better once you go in with your
face powder and kind of buff it in
that's when it looks good for contouring
I'm of course going to dip into this
shade right here with a more slanted
angled side of the brush okay carve this
out
okay
that is a contour so although it is a
contour I am not mad at the tone I do
however want to try it with my regular
contour brush to see how it works with
my tools as opposed to the Kym one so it
picked up a tiny bit on my morphe m1 for
three my go to contouring brush and
let's try it on the other side so
applying it with my go to contouring
brush it definitely is a lot faster I
think blending is a tiny bit easier
because I mean you said this brush so am
i saying that Kim brush is that for
contouring absolutely not but with my
morphe one because I know it so well
it's just a tiny bit quicker and easier
to blend if you don't know how to
contour get this brush and slit your
contour for the rest of your life I will
say again though that even the contour
is leaning warm it is definitely on the
warmer side now I like my contour to be
cool as hell this is warmer does it look
bad no but it's it's not what I'm used
to
I'm going to contour my jawline and
while I'm at it I'm going to do a little
bit of my go-to nose contouring by just
drawing a soft blurred line up down the
center to the tip
we're rushing to go in with a tiny bit
of Oprah's Bellini
and then now it's time for my favorite
part of this entire kid when I
highlighted Kim with the medium kid
honestly I did not expect the highlight
to be bette intense and so I applied it
onto her face and it just got me out of
nowhere so I am super excited to be
applying this I'm gonna go in with this
shade right here I'm ready
miss k'kaw is is not playing around with
the glow oh my mom's crazy good love
this just for a highlight alone I'm like
please get this out as an individual
this is amaze look I love that the
highlight is nice and light enough for
my first skin tone is blind it beams it
does everything a good highlighter
should be doing and I'm obsessed I'm
obsessed applying highlighter with this
brush is fun it is big enough to cover
your highlight area plus blend it out as
you go I'll be applying the more peachy
shade above my brows and like right on
the center a little bit on the chin keep
still get that strobing going on baby I
really like this brush for highlighting
it is dense to like get it on but soft
enough to blend it as you go
so that is what my face looks like after
browsing contouring and highlighting
with the light k'kaw powder contour and
highlight kit and I must say I'm really
enjoying the outcome is the bronzer way
too warm yes is the contour on the
warmer side yes but somehow once you're
done and you pair it up with nice bronze
smokey eyes it works I don't think it
looks that is a too warm all right let
me throw a quick nude glossy lip on to
really get that Kardashian going and
we'll go to the final round of review
and then is what the k'kaw powder
highlight and contour kits look like on
my face I am definitely positively
obsessed with the highlight I think it
is so pretty and even wearing it on like
my collarbones they're non-existent but
they're there and like on my shoulders
and it's giving me a very like sexy
radiant glow so my absolute favorite
thing about these are the highlights and
when it comes to the brush the highlight
side I think I think it's pretty damn
awesome
now I am going to repeat myself a little
bit I think the bronzer is way too warm
and if there's anyone with a similar
skin tone to me it's going to be too
warm for you as well now can we make it
work I feel like with most 90% of all
makeup on this planet there is a way to
make it work so can we make this bronzer
work yes we can I applied it today using
a very very light hand using a light
light layer and it warms it just up
enough but it is leaning a little muddy
a warm is it the most pleasant thing to
work with no as far as the contour shade
I don't think we can say anything bad
about it
I just prefer something a little bit
more cool tone on my face there are
people who like to contour with bronzer
so it's all personal preference I also
want to suggest the following because
the Kim kardashian-west
Russians have interchangeable heads and
this one is good but not my favorite I
want to switch this one out for the
little flat top kabuki side from the
previous plunge because I like that one
way better than the sponge and I'm
plopping it on and you can custom make
your own brush to however you like so I
really like that idea I'm just waiting
for more and more versatile brushes so
overall do I recommend the powder
contour and highlight kids by k'kaw I'm
going to say if you're okay with working
a little differently than usual so going
in with a lighter hand the bronzer being
a little bit too warm if you're okay
with that I say yes because I think the
highlight is definitely worth it
I think the brush this side of the brush
is worth it if you're on a budget and
you want something that you can get the
most out of so everything works from the
palette for my skin tone that's not
going to work I don't foresee myself
going in with a bronzer a lot the
contour saves sometimes but you know
Road Isles got my heart I'm going to
leave it up to you it's the product
quality good enough yes so that is
basically all I can say about this lunch
I hope this was helpful in showing you
how the products apply to the face how
they blend out what they look like I
hope this was helpful to you definitely
sound off in the comments down below
what you think of this launch is it
worth it is it not worth it

will work for your skin tone as always
