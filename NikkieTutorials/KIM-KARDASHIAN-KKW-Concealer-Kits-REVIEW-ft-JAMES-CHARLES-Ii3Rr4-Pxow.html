hello as you can tell sister James is
back
hello sisters my bag is currently 3 M we
can't get rid of it welcome to our k'kaw
concealer and breaking and powder first
impressions review here's the thing I'm
currently in LA for currently at patrick
stars studio they're there the queen is
hello so if you were to see his review
i'll leave it in the screen somewhere I
was like Patrick I'm travelling people
really want to see this review for me so
what can we do first thing you said was
girl I got a kit for you and then James
came up with the amazing idea that he
will elaborate right now I see all the
reviews everybody shares their opinion
obviously however a review a lot of
times though people that say oh well I
have a different skin type will that
work for me or I hope I different skin
tones you exactly for me or effort means
yes I've always literally whatever like
a series where reviews would be with
another youtuber another makeup artist
that could weigh in on their opinions
together yeah I kind of share and
contrast their views and kind of even
like debate back and forth on different
things to really decide is a product
worth buying and worth the money and I
think that exactly you should be fun for
your opinions the better so that is what
we're doing today I am so excited so
without any further ado we're gonna dive
into the PR package and let's see what
this collection is all about alright so
we have two PR kids right here opening
it up oh okay so the first thing we see
is categories of four there's four
concealers fair light medium and deep
wears deep dark sea the thing with most
like foundation concealer ranges is a
lot of brands come up with the limited
range to test the waters and then they
expand yeah but your Kim Kardashian's I
will say for the 16 shades that are here
the ombre from the lightest to the
darkest is pretty strong look at the
first four which is my range
fair range let's just say that I only
see a difference happening here and then
these three look the exact same they do
thing I think that the overall range
between the actual 16 is pretty good but
I definitely would like to see probably
four more I'm also thinking it's
concealers and usually what people want
from concealers is that it brightens so
then when looking into the box we also
find a loose setting powder this week is
from the fair range number one looks
like that and we also have a pressed
powder hello not a break a nail I shadow
that does look like the shade of an
eyeshadow you know what I really I just
really want to get this on my face Sam
I'll see for myself how this applies how
this works how it blends out how it's
set I would look I would build let's do
it down the first product we're gonna do
is foundation but this is not a
foundation video so we're just gonna do
that off camera real quick and we'll be
back in three two one
ah I'm scared of how we look right now
I'm not I like the process all right so
let's move on to the concealers i right
here have the fair selection and I have
the light selection so number one is
pretty darn light so I'm gonna use that
for it lightning but I also want to
cancel out the darkness a little bit and
I feel like number three should do the
job and when I look at the description
it says that number one is a very light
with warm undertones concealer and
number three is a fair light with cool
undertones and I was gonna use at number
five to brighten but if you look at it
number seven has any more well actually
on camera listening assembler eight
number eight is a deep medium with warm
undertones number five is a light medium
with warm undertones as well I'm just
gonna use five for now okay and my
instant reaction is that when it's going
on it feels very very soft and goes on
super smoothly
oh that looks like a good match okay
okay first initial thought it's very
creamy before it doesn't feel very nice
going on the skin feels creamy it feels
like it's rich in texture it does
however since the shape tape concealer
came out I feel like most concealers
recently and foundations as well have
been coming out with dosa applicators
which some people love it some people
definitely hate for sanitary reasons
this is not a dolphin applicator it's
more of a flat oh look aqua heater it's
already starting to oxidize on me yeah
it is oxidizing a little bit as well
when you freshly apply the concealer it
definitely goes on later then where
you've already applied it like down here
so it does our size a little bit okay
well it also dries down really fast
really yeah okay so we do have to brush
but as you know me if you watched my
channel you know that I am unable to
make a brush work so I'm just using my
yeah trusty old sponge to balances and
now I wanna give this a fair shot I also
do not use a brushes ever for my
foundation ever but obviously you guys
should use whatever typically works for
you and your makeup routine so typically
what I do a concealer I used to always
pick a shade that was pretty close to a
skin tone but more recently I've
actually been highlighting my under eyes
and the center my face a lot more I
always complain about my hairline being
really high and my face looking walking
along I think I've been doing that and I
picked a lighter shade today for an
obvious reason I'm bringing but there's
not a whole lot of brightening going on
so I'm gonna actually still what about
sister Nicci shades from the light range
maybe number they all look the same so
does really matter I'm blending out
number two on my under eyes and also
using number two now and this is what it
does
coverage wise so it is highlighting me
quite a bit it is giving me coverage but
it's not like compared to like my
favorite NARS soft matte concealer in a
little pot that has coverage for days
and this is you know being marketed as a
full coverage concealer it is I I can
tell that this to most people would be
very full coverage but
to us makeup-free for us this is like a
medium that honestly does make sense up
because I feel like full coverage to Kim
yeah it's not like 70 hours a night
right so I feel like this does once
again make sense in the sense that this
is the collaboration with her makeup
artist Mario so I think to the average
everyday makeup wearer this would be a
really great full coverage concealer
like Nicky said this is my face after
blending it in completely as you can see
it definitely hit my dark circles
they're not completely gone like if I
turn away from the lighting a little bit
you can just like totally see that let's
do a little bit there I'm gonna grab
number one and I just wanna see if I can
highlight a bit more okay so as you guys
can see using number two which is in the
fair range which I would really not
consider my skin tone that's actually
doing a much better job of brightening
me up which I actually really really
like also I'm covering my beard and
shadow because this sister is a brother
so it's actually doing a pretty decent
job of covering it up like you can see
but there is a little bit of a great
undertone but honestly I have not found
a concealer today still that does not do
that so I'm okay the trick to setting
your under-eye without increasing
throughout the day is to immediately go
in with your baking powder after like
working that concealer in I must think
it is blending in super smoothly it goes
into the like it blends into the skin
stunningly I don't see any weird like
marks I don't see anywhere like gaps it
doesn't look too too cakey I see one
thing that I'm actually surprised I
don't know if it's actually in a good
way or a bad way necessarily this come
see there seems to dry down really fast
which doesn't really bother me I usually
tend to blend quickly anyway but when it
dries down it's not drying down as dewy
as I would have expected
I feel like although Kim started off
with like that full intense highlighted
Mac lab more recently she's been rocking
that like natural dewy skin tone which
literally everybody including me has
been trying to recreate with every
product in the book so I'm actually kind
of surprised that this concealer isn't a
lot more dewy like that look that Kevin
than going for our right I have begun
setting using that number one powder
it's a very fine thin powder like it's
very thin in texture it is way more thin
than a Laura Mercier okay item number
two
compared to my favorite Maybelline fit
me oh that's a whole different like
that's a whole different game that is so
much more like thick and opaque this is
almost like it almost reminds me of an
HD powder like the fineness of it like
the thinness of it that also modifies I
know a little bit of tad a bit of
coverage in that can't look for free
polygons you can still see the under-eye
bags
mm-hmm you can still see the backs a
little bit not gonna lie mm-hmm there's
a no bags though thank you
but they're there thank you so what I
usually do is grab my Laura Mercier
translucent powder to set the rest of my
face using my damp sponge so I guess I'm
gonna have to do that using the same
powder today what's really good for this
is I get a really oily t-zone throughout
the day if I said just my t-zone using
this powder I feel like it's gonna keep
the oils that base so much longer than
my usual powder like the Laura Mercier
so that I'm definitely liking when I
look really up-close and personal at my
pores
they are blurred there is coverage but
Mama's looking a little dry so that
setting spray later on is really gonna
have to save my ass so for me I have
more oily skin and I am using a
different foundation than normal for
today's video being that I am at
Patrick's house obviously the Marc
Jacobs foundation is very full coverage
if you know the foundation it is intense
to say the least and I'm honestly not
the biggest fan of how these two are
brushing together being that they are
both very very very much and very dry
like Nicky said at my face is feeling a
little bit intense right now I'm
definitely relying on I feel a little
bit advice or setting spray so what I'm
gonna try is going in with the setting
powder like the
pressed powder take a little look what
is this like a little cushion I rub it
in to the powder and this is a trick for
if you want maximum coverage out of your
powders and then with that tap the
under-eye I still can't get mine open oh
look how brightening huh whoa see now
we're talking Kim K under I iced okay
wide open for me what I have and red
powder I actually like to use my damp
Beauty Blender I always like to use
Beauty blenders when it comes to a
melting powder into the skin and chefs
we consider we have very very full
coverage intense and it's going on right
now so I want to do anything I possibly
can to kind of melt it down a little bit
you knew what this powder will be
amazing for one remember how you always
grab your powder when you do your nose
country to kind of push the size and you
vacuum look at this it's soap look
comparable whoa right nice that's a good
idea about the brightening do this to
pinch in that nose contour oh my gosh oh
she is bright tiny she's a brighter so
far this is my favorite product yeah
this is what is making my heart race
well I don't have a heart anymore but if
I had one it would be racing grow Oh
what my lord hello
alright so this is what our bases look
like after the foundation concealer the
powder and the brightening powder and so
far I'm really happy with this I like it
I'm not jumping through the roof I wish
I was a little bit more dewy not gonna
lie I do feel dry but I like it I like
how it looks I feel like this will
photograph very very well stash the
cheekbones pretty badly
so let's contour quickly and then come
right back and we will test out the
baking powder once again but to actually
bake this time alright so the magic of
makeup has just happened it's been about
let's be honest like a good hour since
we applied our products when I look at
my skin I see a veil of blur like my
pores look blurred I think my skin looks
really good
looks a little bit drying like here
looks a little dry but I have to say I'm
obsessed with the brightening powder
like it makes me so happy oh yeah being
honest was not loving it when we started
I said it was a little bit drying on my
skin I do have oily skin too which is
honestly surprising for me yeah but as I
kind of did my makeup and let it kind of
sit on the face it did warm up on me a
little bit so kind of like melted in
yeah a slight bit I'm really looking
forward to myself a good spread of it
Mac supposed to kind of melt everything
together at my face really need to in
fact let's gonna do that right now
I love the under eye brightening powder
I feel like it looks so beautiful so
flawless the only thing that's kind of
getting these done is there's a little
bit of texture right up in here and
right up in here where I'm kind of more
oily person where the powder kind of
clung to those areas so maybe this
wouldn't be the best product for oily
skin that's weird because I thought
because I'm dry I thought it's so
mattifying this is gonna be great for it
oh yeah I would think the same thing but
I think in the powder might have kind of
clung to some of the oily spots yeah
okay I'm gonna bronze snap here you go
the snow's need some help right now guys
for all my Orly some people out there
especially for you guys who have oily
noses I do have to report back and you
guys know my like number one thing when
it comes to up my whole face application
is that my nose contour is always my
biggest thing and my biggest pet peeve
when it comes to that is when the makeup
will start to rub off my nose yeah
and while rubbing this contour powder
over top of urban my nose it's rubbing
away the concealer underneath and which
was set with the powder which sucks to
say but she's coming off I want to grab
that pressed powder and I heard another
say number three which is the more
oh shit I'm gonna try to cup my beauty
blunder and kind of press that an to the
nose contour to kind of snatch it up and
also hopefully bring back some of that
pigment that was lost from the blending
process oh oh it's working oh gosh is
good that brightening fuck I'm scared of
the blood oh my god facetune tones in
real life that's enough oh my my nose
bedroom has never looked better without
face in my entire life
see I'm telling you the Brady Feder is I
so good I really do not like it the
loose powder but this I need to order
67m right now yeah cuz you're only good
I should have pants I alright so we have
done her makeup start to finish what do
you think I am impressed with the
brightening powder the concealer is a
good product I think overall it's it's
decent coverage I wouldn't say it's fall
I would say it's warm medium to fall you
can layer it it does oxidize a little
bit it's great it's not like wow I like
the concealer I think it's beautiful on
the skin it blended in so smoothly who
so nicely it just didn't have an ignite
bra on me I don't know but I didn't have
that whoa yeah as far as the loose
setting powder I don't like it I mean I
like my Cody Harris one more and that's
like what five dollars so now what she
really need it no but the brightening
powder those oh my god from this
collection brightening powder
brightening powder brightening powder
that's just please I'm begging anyone
who's watching this from the team bigger
pants yeah
bigger pants especially for $18 to for
the same price but one note we would
like to make about the brightening
powders though number four is orange and
as much as a warm tone highlight does
look beautiful on a lot of people of
color yeah that caller said never be
nobody orange orange
under
izes like your color correcting but you
forgot to like take care of that with
any product opinions are like assholes
