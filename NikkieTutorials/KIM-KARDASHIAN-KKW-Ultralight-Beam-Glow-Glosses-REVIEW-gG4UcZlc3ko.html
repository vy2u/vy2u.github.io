of you who are new here hi my name is
Nikki and I wear foundation lips a lot
until the very end so today if you're
new here I got no lips they're gone
they left the building so if you're new
here I always like to wear foundation on
my lips until the very end to have a
very clean canvas so if you're anywhere
don't hate appreciate the art okay today
I'm actually really excited for this
video because I'm gonna be reviewing the
brand new k'kaw Kim kardashian-west
the Neal ultralight beam collection this
is a collection consisting of five lip
glosses and five pigment / glows /
powders and I'm actually so so excited
about this launch because if we have
seen the visuals of this collection we
are all wanting to go to the gym right
now and sprinkle ourselves in glitter so
this is what the collection looks like
and how it will be sold is as duos so
you see the gloss on top the pigment
slash glow powder on the bottom it will
be sold as a set like that so in one
little duo you get one gloss and one
powder and this year duo just to get
this out of the way before we start one
duo retails for $32 so you got one gloss
and one pigment and if you're in the
mood to buy the entire kit which means
out which means all five glosses and off
of globe powders that retails for one
hundred and sixty dollars so just to get
that out of the way to kind of put in
the back of your mind as we're like
watching how this magic unfolds so if
you're looking at me funny I agree with
you I did my base makeup my brows and my
eyeshadow and I want to zoom you guys in
and see how the shadows or like the glow
powders work on the eye
are they good on the eye or they just
meant for a glow on the cheeks let's
find out I'm gonna zoom you in and let's
let's see if this collection is any good
hello hello hello hello thank you so
this is what my eye looks like without
any of the globe pigments if you're
wondering today for the eyes I use Dee
Kylie cosmetics nice eye shadow palette
from her holiday collection I was like
let's keep it in the family she
we so if you ask me this is looking a
little simple so let's spruce it up by
using one of the pigments I'm gonna be
using this one right here called rose
gold on the lid so it's got a beautiful
rose gold base but the sheen in it is
super super golden so I think it's gonna
tie in nicely with like the jewelry I'm
wearing today and that's gonna be a look
so first I'm going to apply with a dry
brush and then I want to see if we can
really intensify with a damp brush here
we go dry brush packing it on to a
little bit of fallout so that is some
serious shine from just applying it dry
so now let's see if we can really
intensify by applying it wet or like
damn
so I can't necessarily say that that
really intensified it I feel like it
just gave it a little bit more coverage
but it's not like oh my god it's so much
more the only thing that's really
bothering me is that glittery fallout
because this is the type of Fallout that
will stay on your face for the entire
day
this type of fallout is so hard to
remove because there's always something
left so just try to flick it away and
this is also the type of Fallout that
will go in your brow as you can see on
your foot it will go everywhere I think
the best technique to really give this
impact is to use a concealer underneath
so cut the lid using this Mac select
cover-up concealer and then really pack
it on and I feel like that is really
gonna grab it and get a hold of it but
this is what we're looking at without
any damage on the inner corner and brow
bone I want to use this one right here
this one is called iridescent
and it's got a pinky tone to it but the
sheen of it is silver oh no mind you
this is a damn fresh because if I would
do this with a dry brush it would be
sparkles everywhere but browbone just
very soft and like a sheen and it's in
my brows so this is how they perform on
the eye I'm definitely more of a fan
when using them damp because I'm missing
a little bit of density with these
they're so finely milled they're so thin
in texture and so soft that they almost
don't have a grip and just kind of go
everywhere so using I'm damp definitely
helps I'm gonna put on some lashes and
let's see how they work on the face
alright so this is the eyes done and I'm
definitely liking the end result I did
have to work with all this sparkly
fallout all over my face I had to brush
it off I mean used to you can brush it
off so it's fixable but it's it's a
hassle when I look at the entire kit I
only see one color fit for my skin tone
to highlight with and that is the
iridescent shade now I am a little bit
scared because I feel like as soon as
you start brushing this in
it's gonna flare up and it's gonna land
everywhere so I definitely want to try
and use a more tapping motion for the
highlighter to keep it a little bit more
contained and another trick I will be
using is because this powder is so loose
and finely milled I feel like it doesn't
have a lot of grip so to give it more
grip you're gonna spray some setting
spray right before you hit the brush on
your cheek and this is gonna grab aunt
it it's sort of like using a damp brush
but your skin is damp and the brush is
just gonna do the work for you I'm gonna
spray my cheek a little bit wait for it
to almost be dry I learnt this from
macdaddy wait for it to almost be dry
and then go in with the brush and the
highlighter all right so now it's almost
dry and let's oh my I did not expect
this
so that is what the highlighter looks
like after one blended in layer and I
must say I really really like how this
looks on the skin okay I thought this
was gonna go horribly wrong not gonna
lie but we're mmm we're shot and shot
and shadowing a little bit more so onto
the glasses and I want to show you some
options so first I'm gonna show you how
they look each of them how they look
like on my bare lips my personal lips
are really pigmented and red so it's
basically like applying these glosses on
top of a red lipstick but I feel like if
I do it on top of foundation is just
gonna look like the same nude gloss
every time so let's just find out what
they look like on my pigmented fat lips
and if they have any coverage and after
that we're gonna play with a little bit
of color underneath
I'm sorry loops you gotta go so here are
my natural lips and now let's see how
the glosses look on top so the first one
I'm gonna go in with is iridescent
before I do that can we just oh my god I
hate to be that person but same
component so if you're thinking wow that
looks familiar it's cuz the Stila
magnificent I metals the the Stila the
Stila ones are the same component oh my
god it's bluish oh my god it's blue so
the pigment is more pinky with a silver
bluish like Sheen to it but the gloss
has a straight-up blue sheen and oh my
god it makes your lips look big it's got
a little bit of pigmentation to it but
the mosha see in this class is the
bluish like icy Sheen in it and I this
is winter sexiness as far as how the
gloss feels you definitely feel that it
is a gloss it's not overly intensely
sticky it's definitely a lip gloss
stickiness but it's not like mac
lipglass really
also when I rub my lips together and
don't feel any grittiness from the
glitter or like the sparkles in it so
that's really nice and asked for the
scent it doesn't have any its no scent
scentless
so that is what iridescent looks like
all right next up is the yellowish gold
one called
yellow gold and the pigment in this
reminds me a lot of trophy wife by finta
beauty so if you're looking for
something that is infinity Beauty plus
and a pigment or maybe this would be it
so let's give the glass a try
okay so in this one the color of the
sheen itself is definitely a lot less
visible than the one with iridescent
because but everybody just saw blue with
this I don't really see I see it on the
initial like first swipe but then as you
start working it in I mean I guess you
kind of do see the yellowness but it's
like very faint all right so that
definitely gives my lips a more warm
feel but as far as the Sheen color it's
not as intense as they were disent but
still it's a very beautiful sparkly
gloss I mean you can see it's Sparkle
from like mouths away I wonder what it
looks like if I Pat in a little bit of
the pigment over top let's play our
getting a little bit of the pigment and
then now I look like the visual from the
collection because Kim kind of had this
on her lips with the gold in the center
ooh well I guess now we know how Kim did
her lips for the visuals oh my god if
you pack the pigment over top of the
glass really lightly it's gonna leave
you with a little bit of more color it's
gonna leave you looking a little bit
more shimmery and shiny and I am loving
this the gloss alone I was like yeah
cute of wrote new lipsticks but like
with this pigment over top I'm like I'm
here for it all right third gloss rose
gold this reminds me a little bit of the
fenty beauty lip gloss so if you're
interested to see if this is rose gold
by Kim kW and this is the Finn T Beauty
gloss so the fenty Beauty one is
definitely a lot lot darker and if we
compare it to the copper one that one is
a lot more orange e so the fenty one is
kind of like right in between plus it's
a lot darker so if you wanted to know
that know you'd know because I know you
want to hear it
okay that has like no color yeah that is
just a straight-up gloss so this one is
just on my lips right now a straight-up
gloss I definitely sparkles a lot less
than the previous two you I mean with
the previous two uses particles with
this one you see the spark leanness but
it's not as intense as the other one so
if you like something a little bit less
sparkly this one is your go and I mean I
am wearing the rose gold pigment on my
lids so I rather buy this set for the
pigment than the gloss if I'm quite
honest with you all right time for
bronze and bronze is a special little
one because this one has shimmers in it
that shift from green and blue to purple
and pink and then it also has a bronze
base oh that's pretty
I need to see this with the flash on do
you see all those sparkles in it
oh we're gonna feel like simply no
logical with her hallo and as for the
pigment in this set this is what it
looks like this is stunning on the
eyeballs if you're of a deeper
complexion this is gonna look like
liquid metal on you and it's gonna look
so good last one of the bunch is copper
I am excited for this one I feel like
this is gonna untie by my red lips gonna
look so bomb oh my god Christmas called
hello I never wear my natural lips as a
base but if you like with this and then
the look and then the jewelry and then
the backdrop I feel like my looks
finished it has such a good shine to it
like look how the light hits it and it's
got that sparkle this might be one of my
favorites out of the entire bunch
because I feel like it's so on season
it's perfect for like a late fall early
winter perfect for the holidays I mean
oh my god and this is what the pigment
looks like right here
I feel like again if you're of a deeper
complexion this is gonna look so bomb
and for all us pasties out there this is
gonna be beautiful for like a smoky eye
I feel like this color actually goes
really nicely in the center right for
like the colors meet but I am gonna dip
in and try it a little bit on the lips
favorite combo of the entire set I feel
like if you need one combo in your life
it's the copper one because oh alright
so let's try it on top of a nude lip so
first I'm gonna burn through some
because it's we'll put one and then
let's keep it in the family I'm gonna go
in with this Kylie Jenner the matte
liquid lipstick in the colour Libra
and then the glass is going to be
applying over top is iridescent and that
is what that looks like and that
definitely transformed it into a very
luscious glossy lip I mean I feel like
you see the sparkle of the blueness and
just the sparkling this overall more on
a darker lip but still on a new lip it's
it's a pretty pretty gloss then for the
final lip I want to go for something
really really dark this is makeup
forever 3 note 503 matte lip paint this
is going to go all the way all the way
on top all the way on top and then on
top of this I'm going to be applying the
copper one because if you like dark
colors and coppers are everything
so that is what that looks like with the
gloss and it just adds so much shine so
much sparkle and I love it it's perfect
for the holiday season and then now
we're gonna go crazy and apply the
copper pigment into the center and there
we have it so yeah let me zoom back out
and give you my final thoughts and that
guys includes this first impression
slash review video on the k'kaw Beauty
my final thoughts are that I think these
are so pretty but you definitely don't
need them all
I think the glosses are amazing quality
they're nice and soft they don't feel
too tacky on the lips you don't feel any
greediness or any of that like the
sparkles gritting against your lips they
actually feel really nice and
comfortable but at the end of the day
it's the gloss and a lot of glosses tend
to look the same at the very end of the
day so I feel like it's definitely a go
to get at least one of the duo's if any
of the colors are like speaking to you
definitely get one but do you need the
entire set no if I have to give you my
recommendations I feel like copper is an
absolute must I feel like the iridescent
blue which one is really stunning but if
you hate blue on the lips you're not
gonna like it but the pigment is really
pretty as a highlighter and inner corner
shine so it's a very you can get this
but then you also have to do this you
can have this but then you also get this
I feel like rose gold was just a plain
old gloss that you can buy everywhere
but the pigment is really pretty I see
that's what it happens that's what
happens at the end of the day you decide
what you want to purchase and if you
think the price is worth it again $32
for one duo and 160 dollars for the
entire set I cannot look into your
wallets if that is all such a personal
preference so if you think that is worth
it it is worth it if you think that is
so not worth it it's not worth it so I
hope that helped I hope that gave you a
better look into these and helped you
pick out what you want and what you
don't want let me know in the comments
down below what you think be totally
honest with me sound off in the comments
