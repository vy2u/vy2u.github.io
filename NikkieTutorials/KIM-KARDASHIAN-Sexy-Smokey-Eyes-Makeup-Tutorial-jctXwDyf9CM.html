inspired by wafer it Kim Kardashian me
doing Kim Kardashian it's revolutionary
Kim recently still laid the red carpet
in can and so many of you send me
pictures on Twitter and on Instagram to
do an inspired tutorial by it and Here I
am doing that for you because Kim looked
amazing just the pop of black on the
lower lash line and just a ah so I was
inspired by that look and added a little
bit more glam to by adding some more
gold but pretty much stayed as close to
the look as possible so if you would
like to know how to get this Kim
Kardashian can 2016 inspired makeup look
keep on watching
alright I had quite the emotional day
yesterday it was it was a good emotional
day but lots of crying so my eyes feel
very puffy today so I'm gonna go in
first with my B nigma cream - deep Hough
and tighten up this face I've talked
about the B enigma cream on my channel
before and what this does is really deep
Hough and tighten whatever area you put
it on and I really like this for what I
have emotional days or when I haven't
had a lot of sleep only downside to this
product is that it is expensive but I
have a discount code for you in the
bottom that will get you 25% off and I
also like to put some right here almost
smile wise because this cream has a
tendency to really flatten lines and
this will help prevent you getting smile
lines throughout the day for a little
bit more moisture I'm gonna go in with
this this works in transit spray on
moisture for foundation today I'm gonna
go in with my favorite mixture of the
moment the Too Faced Born This Way I'm
gonna mix pearl mostly with a little bit
of snow to lighten it and with my Beauty
Blender I'm just gonna bounce this in
all right so just a fill layer my
kidding that was not even close to being
thin for concealer and first going in
with this Mac paint stick and pure white
and I love using this to lighten and
brighten up my concealer that I put over
top so I put this right here right here
and then once you put concealer on over
top that is really going to brighten it
and make it look fresh and then going
over top use my a cosmetics my under eye
L light
and again blend in using the beauty
blender
and I'm going to set it all using my
NARS powder in snow first thing as
always to keep this look on all day long
Mac soft ochre Paint Pot and also like
always applying it using the Sigma 3d HD
precision rush to help lending later on
and I'm going to set my brow bone in
crease area using a matte skin tone
shade and this will make your life so
much easier with blending I'll be using
coloured raine eyeshadows only today and
the first color I'm going to go in with
is this one right here called
Gingerbread and with my morphe M 504
brush I'm just going to define the
crease we also really want to wing it
out here because that will really help
pull the look together in the end for
the lid I'm gonna go in with champagne
life but first I'm going to apply the
violet Voss glitter adhesive as a base
so with my mac 242 I'm just going to lay
down the base first so the shadow has
something to grab on to and then go
straight over top with champagne life
cycle it right and this color is life
I'm going to mix in chocolate on the
outer corners of the lid and doing so
using my Smith two three five fresh and
also slightly wing it out on the outer
corners here to pull the look together
in the end and then also a tiny tiny bit
of the black and this is called black
moon just a tiny tiny bit right here on
the outer corners okay now it's time for
the fun part these smoking out of the
lower lashline and I'm again going in
with black moon by coloured raine and
with my Sigma s 68 brush I'm first going
to determine the direction of the lower
lashline and after you've decided where
the new lower lashline inner corner
tends to go to then you can drag the
black all across the lower lashline and
then once you reach the outer corners
you want to drag out that line straight
and now with my luck C 217 brush I'm
just going to blend it out a little bit
now with my favorite color from the
entire line clutch curls I'm going to
highlight my inner corners and brow bone
and I'm using a Smith to 5/3 brush for
this
with my Kevin a Quan precision eye
definer in black I'm going to darken the
waterline and all you want to do not to
finish up the eyes is apply some falsies
and I'm going to go for these ones right
here by glossy makeup called Hyde Park
alright time for cheeks now of course
Kim Kardashian's cheeks look like they
can fly her off to Mars like they are
popping and my cheekbones are not
popping so in order to make them popping
I'm going to contour using my Kevyn
Aucoin and medium sculpting powder but
my favorite morphe contouring brush my
m5 30 and I'm going to sharpen or deepen
the contour using the delay by 140 brush
just at this portion right here and as
always with my morphe m-44 4 I'm going
to clean up underneath and tap at the
edges to give it a nice blend and that
is how you slay a contour Kevin iguana
also came out with a light sculpting
powder and going to use this too soon at
the nose
and if you want to see an in-depth video
on how I contour my nose like this then
please check back to the previous video
for watching them and go in with Sigma
or a powder in Nymphaea and my favorite
blush brush by morphe DM 509 and I love
that Kim had a little pop of color on
those cheeks cuz syllabus were super d
saturated and nude and the eyes are so
vicious so I love that pop of color on
the cheeks and then for the ultimate
glow I'm gonna go in with the sleek
highlighting palette in solstice and
taking that lightest color right there
and that is gonna blind every makeup
hater out there it's just tip of my nose
and my Cupid's bow Kim's lips were
lovely nude and matte so I'm going to go
for this mixture today this is a
two-faced a child star with Jeffrey
stars I'm nude
and I want to do not to keep this on all
day long is set using a makeup setting
spray and I'll be using the Urban Decay
