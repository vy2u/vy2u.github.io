we're changing things up a bit on my
channel today is the first episode of
face match and face match is a series
where we have one face my face two
artists and a challenge so in face match
I want to experiment the artistic
choices an artist makes when doing
makeup I want to see what goes on in an
artist head before coming up with a look
and I want to compare my mind to other
artists minds
I feel like this way you really get to
know your favorite artists like how they
come up with looks how do they go about
it what's their game plan how do they do
it and how different is it from me so in
today's video I'll be trying out the
brand new k'kaw and Mario collection
this collection contains a full
eyeshadow palette two lip glosses and a
lipstick and I get to play with it today
for the first time ever so it's my first
time dipping in but it's not just my
first time playing with this palette
it's also the first time for Mitchell
and Mitchell has been one of my all-time
favorite makeup artists on Instagram for
the longest time now he gives me so much
in spring like literally he is an artist
to the core
both Mitchell and I tip confessionals
earlier this morning to tell you exactly
what we have in mind for this look the
rules are simple every facematch episode
has a different challenge and today's
challenge is using every eyeshadow color
in the palette that we're using today
and today we're using the k'kaw mario
palette whatever both mitchell and i
said in our confessionals this morning
is what we have to stick to in our
tutorial portion so let's say I said in
my confessional I want the blue all over
as soon as I start doing my makeup I
have to stick to that it might just so
happen that Mitchell and I both come up
with the same look it also might just
very well so happen that we come up with
two completely different looks and this
is nice because this palette isn't out
yet
this gives you a chance to look at two
different looks using the pallet so it
gives you more variety and it shows you
more options to this pallet and
collection since you asked me we've been
sitting around for way too long it's
time to actually dig into this new k'kaw
and Mario collection see what it's all
about see how it performs with two
artists please sit down and enjoy the
first episode of facematch
hi guys so I'm Mitchell and I'm from the
Instagram page memama Mitchell we're
gonna be using the k'kaw and maybe I'll
come up here is the palette I'm gonna be
quite typical in the crease I'm gonna
use these two shades and then deep it up
with this shade definitely use this on
the way oh my god no deepen the crease
this one blend out the deep with this
one blend up with this one and this on
the lid with a spotlight of there and
then then even like a spotlight of this
on the weight I think I'll be a really
nice statement a belieber the blue one
on the wall us on another how thing is
I've got to stick with that yeah so I
can't go back on myself at this one now
so I'm gonna keep that there and just
for my reference let's go
I'm gonna start by carving out a shape
for the brow just so then when we do the
bars later on I've got a little bit of a
guideline to follow make sure it's
really nice and blended to this game so
we're gonna go into this shade Albania
I'm gonna start in the very center of
the socket start to wiggle my brush it's
incredible how light your touch is I
can't get over it
my particular need it's not even a
tickle take like a vibrator I'm just
interested to see where you're gonna put
that blue now that you saying this I
just fuckin it's gonna blow in a
different place to this middle shade on
the top though I'm gonna do I'm just
gonna place this just around the edges
of that ready I'm in shade oh my got the
blending King has arrived
I'm just doing nice
his motions almost just scratching that
edge away so I'm just gonna go back in
with our previous shade Albanian just
build that back up one more time
remember just keeping your pressure
really really like now I'm gonna start
to add depth to this I'm gonna take this
shade which is why you'll tear you're
gonna take my foot up almost on my the
side of the butch rather than that tip
of the brush I'm gonna place my brush
just on the outer corner and realize we
just had to wiggle you know it's gonna
be the saddest part is that for once
poof we're gonna see that I suck the
talent getting their natural forced I do
want to point out though something I'm
noticing there's cute back in the pan
see it's nothing like you know I'm lousy
on ya but I do want to point it out now
to create a spotlight our pee-wee's Bay
I'm gonna start Matson high and when I'm
doing this guys I'm just tapping onto
the skin go back into our deepest share
that we use loyalty I'm just tapping
this over where that concealer ends
we're gonna go in to 2008 oh my god
maybe all what have you done had all
that color is the balloon there I'm
gonna take this shade Armenian and this
is gonna go either side of that spot
that we've just created
I love that it's palate is allowing me
to create a really heavy look guys know
I expected from and they take this shade
of balaam it's coming just next to that
Armenian shade each shade that I'm using
I've gone almost have one next to it so
I'm gonna take this bronzer shade and
I'm just gonna come a little bit further
out just on the outer corner but not all
the way over still keep a little bit of
your depth there this shimmers are so
nice in saying oh my god I'm never gonna
take this look off it's so good
this one is left this one and that yeah
oh we're getting somewhere
I'm gonna start on a skin but I think
I'm gonna do it off camera just because
we want the focus to be on the eyes yeah
oh my gosh I love it so much so I'm
gonna do the bottom of the eyes now
and I'm gonna take this as a weaver
pencil first and I'm just going back
into the wild lion I'm just gonna start
to soften up what it's just going in
with this one and this is gonna go on
the outer corner of the lash line
all right under the in a carnival
ashlynn as well but leave in the center
nice and free gotta go into our blue
push it on that lush decade age I'm just
gonna just tap it onto the inner Conner
area mr. Brighton Tibet and I must just
clean it where my shadow might work
today
Mitchell has officially passed the
challenge you used all 10 shades I
applied know what am i helping the
competition classic kay well that's
lighter than I thought it was gonna be a
bit darker like two swipes and it's on
so nice we're gonna take this a juicy
which is this one almost just run the
edges of the left
and then just to give it a nice pop
effect I'm gonna take like I say it
Center guys if you from the UK and you
like a UK noodle you need this okay
today's challenge is creating a full
look using one pallet and we have to use
every single shade in the Mario palette
I saw this on Alyssa Ashley's channel so
that's today's challenge okay okay first
right off the bat what I know is that
this color is gonna end up in my inner
corners that's number one
my main issue is the blue and this
maroon II purple shade because the
Moroney purple shade is shimmery I wish
this wasn't shimmery I feel like the
blue could either go all over the lid
and really take center stage or on the
lower lash line but I feel like that's
what Mitchell might do I feel like I'm
gonna be using this shade in my crease
this shade either also in the crease to
darken and add depth and then also this
gray shade to add more depth I feel like
on the lid are gonna do this one first
and then it blends in to that one
because it's easy to blend into but then
it leaves me with this bronze
what if okay cut crease this one the
crease okay so what if I put this shade
on the inner corner to highlight this
one on the brow bone then I cut my
crease and on the crease is this color
blending into that color deepening with
this color then on the lid I make a
gradient from this shade into that shade
and then maybe a little bit of that
shade what if I blend these two together
so the blue takes the main focus on the
lower lash line and then this blends
into that on the outer corner then
deepened with that oh my god I got it
down I think I got it I feel like that
is what I'm supposed to do and I really
hope that Mitchell doesn't do
that's all right my turn so this is what
Mitchell did he is right there he's in
the audience I must say that color wise
as you could see from my confessionals
we're pretty much in the same level but
my shape and placement is different
the first color I want to go in with
this one this base and the shadows
almost work like a magnet like it clings
on to it so nicely looking a little
darker than I expected though my second
color out of the 10 guess what I said am
I gonna be my transition shade well very
nicely
I love that it's not blending splotchy
and like with like sometimes when you
blend a little portion can look darker
than the other not doing that now that
we've got the crease down it's time for
me to cut the lid which will cut the
crease - I'm going back in with my
pillow ease base and praise you the
makeup gods that this goes so I start
off stamping
Oh you can watch back my confessionals
but I said the dark gray on the outer
corner okay so I have that color on my
outer corner and then I'm gonna focus on
the lid for the lid I said I was gonna
use this shade first unlike the inner
third which is called Armenians such a
Kim K color the golden days light
under-eye golden eye for the center I'm
using this shade this one right here
which is called glam the shimmers are so
pretty they blend so easy you don't even
have to do anything they reflect the
light beautifully the Brasi shade this
one right here is going right in between
the darkness and that Center shade feel
like that Center shade can look a little
grayish like although it's a shimmer it
can look a little grayish in some lights
and this truly like warms it back up
going in with the highlighter shade
which is called 2008 it's probably my
favorite time of the entire palate I
have arrived oh this is what it feels
like to be me again okay so that is the
top lid done - as you can see there's a
difference the shape is different the
placement is different but still you can
see that it works so now I'm going to do
a foundation and concealer just like
Mitchell does it and then I'll be back
for the bottom lashes
um bottom lashes I also planted the blue
on the bottom lashes but not not like
that I'm going in with a blue liner now
I'm gonna go in with the blue which is
called Libra I'm gonna go right over top
to sort of set that liner
oh that blue is not playing around hard
you're wondering when are you gonna use
the purple now at the time I'm gonna
blend into that to the top so I pretty
much use all the colors except for this
one and I want to put it on the brow
bone okay so I is done it's time to
complete the lips since ups don't judge
they feel different than our previous
classes too these feel less sticky oh
this new closes everything boom
I feel like it took me by surprise
because I expected it sort of to not
perform as well it's that shady and I
know a lot of people are probably gonna
ask how does this feel compared to Kylie
Jenner pallets I feel like they're a
world of a difference I feel like these
are a lot more creamy a lot more easy to
apply very smooth very buttery very
intense very nice whereas with Kylie's I
feel like after blending you kind of
lose all you know strength and power so
compared to Kylie
I think this palette bite Kim definitely
wins the only downside I have to this
which isn't the biggest downside but I
should mention it is that there's the
kick back in the palette I think the
other thing I want to say about is you
can really tell that there's a makeup
makeup is behind this palette you can
really tell that mummy always behind it
it's just such a good quality palette
and it's really thought out so that's it
guys that concludes the first episode of
face match with the challenge using
every shadow of a palette now the
question is it's a hard one because I
know where this is gonna go who do you
think won let me know in the comments
