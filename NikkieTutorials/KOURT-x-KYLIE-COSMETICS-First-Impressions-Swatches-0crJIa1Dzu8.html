in the sky I'm floating today I'm gonna
be doing a playtime / first impressions
from a first impressions video /
playtime video using the brand new
highly anticipated court Kylie cosmetics
collection after collaborating with Kim
khloé no candle yet Kylie finally has
decided to partner up with her older
sister Kourtney and it has resulted in
three eyeshadow palettes like I should
have quads and three lip products and I
got it in the mail today and I really
want to sit down and just look at what
it does look at how it performs look at
how it you know goes on the eye and
really give it a go also if you're
wondering why I have the sky as the
backdrop it's because in the campaign
they had like a beige II sort of k'kaw
backdrop and they had the sky and I was
like I can be the sky to your k'kaw
backdrop I can be that so without any
further ado today we're gonna be playing
with the court Kylie cosmetics
collection so if you're interested in
seeing how this performs then sit down
get glam with me and get Graham Lo and
Greg Lynn with me okay bye now you guys
know the secret to any killer i look is
the p lewis base so I'm starting off
with that on a Mac - five - brush I'm
patting this onto the lid and if you
want more info on this base click the
link on the screen right now to take you
to an in-depth video on this base right
here now going into the blue palette and
taking this dark shade right here called
Bible now I'm gonna scare you for a
little bit I'm gonna deposit this color
right on the outer corner of my eye
stamp it on there so we get maximum
pigment holy crap that is pigment in a
shadow hello now with the tips of the
bristles of your brush you want to
create soft circular motions right at
the edge of where we applied Bible
this is going to defuse the line and the
harshness just a tiny bit on another
two-to-one brush by Mac and going into
the color right next to it called
Calabasas and like Mitchell Tadas on the
side of the brush and picking up
Calabasas as sort of scratching it on
right above Bible now switching over to
the paint palette and taking that curly
peachy color called the Queen and
picking this up on a morphe m 514 and
right above where we applied Calabasas
again doing that scratchy motion and I
do want to show you I don't if the
camera is picking it up but there is
kickback in the pan so these shadows are
a little bit more brittle they are a
little bit more sensitive to like power
so you got to make sure that you tapped
your brush in very lightly going back
into the darker colors and re
intensifying them right now and I
literally dip my brush in so lightly
into the shadows just once and that
brings me enough product to work with
and enough pigmentation to work with now
taking my favorite shade out of the
entire collection the yellow gold called
19:44 or trophy wife I said teeth on an
Anasazi Beverly Hills number eighteen
brush I'm applying this to the center of
the lid blending into the darkness and
just like Mitchell taught us tapping
motions only and see how this line right
here is totally not what you wanted to
look like so I'm going to go back in
with Calabasas and blended right in
between and that will give you a lovely
gradient and blend I'm just tapping it
on in between and it's just gonna do the
blending for you and then I like to
personally go back in with 1944 and just
gracefully there's wind in my room just
kind of tap it over where we applied
Calabasas for that final kill of the
like a look at that hello know what I'm
looking at the shadows they're applying
super pigmented they're blending really
nicely the only thing I'm noticing
now is that I need a little bit more of
that Bible back into the outer corner
and more of that what's it called the
Queen right over topic right here it's
missing that a little do you see so
first a little bit of the Bible color
get it back in there hello we're back
and finally the Queen right here yes see
that's what I meant
we're back in the game on the inner
corner and remaining part of the lid I'm
gonna go in with diamond right here oh
my god let me just tell you I feel like
they almost changed the formula of the
shadows feathers launch completely
because they feel more buttery they feel
more soft and they also look more
pigmented than their Kylee shadows that
I've worked with in the past but what
that comes is that they also became a
little bit more sensitive so they became
a little bit more like it's giving you
more kick back in the pan it's giving
you a little bit more fallout but it's
giving you more pigment and I'd rather
have more pigment and a little bit of
fallout that I can easily like kick away
then no pigment and no follow like
nothing I'm liking this a lot now let's
focus on the lower lashes for lower
lashes I'm thinking a Bible on a crown
c510 brush and applying it on the outer
corners see how there's a little bit of
fallout that's the only complaint I have
but it does give you so much pigment
then I mean kind of okay with it because
you can like just look at away then
blending into calabasas so I just want
to go ahead and show you the kickback in
the pan with the darker color so see how
it's giving you the kickback now again I
feel like a lot of people will have
something to say about this now just
hear me out
I don't like kickback in the pan not not
for the slightest bit but when it gives
you so much pigment in the application
of your eye look I'm kind of okay with
it could it have been done better
absolutely is it workable and can I work
with
yeah picking up diamond on a crown see
five to seven brush and highlighting the
inner corners of my lower lashline
all right Sam Marc Jacobs fine wine
liner on the waterline and for lashes
I'm using the Lily lashes in Ella well
since I have you here anyways why not do
our cheeks together so I'm gonna go in
with the next to nothing powder by Mac
called medium dark bronze it up to
bronze it up mama
da uncle I've ever been really filming a
lot because remember how I filmed makeup
like this in New York and I burned my
cheek with a curling iron and it's been
pretty bad and this is the first time in
about three weeks where I feel good
enough about it to actually like do
stuff what's that again it was too
scared to put makeup on it I had to put
makeup on it because we weren't done
filming in New York yet so it's ad
totally made it worth to and then I did
a photo shoot and then made it worse
even worse
so now after three weeks I mean still
see it a little bit but I feel like
finally it's like makeup the boom so
here I am
hello okay for blush I want to go in
with the Mac blush in Spellbinder just
for a nice pop of color on the cheek and
then for highlighter and we'll go back
into the pink palette and taking a
diamond because it is stunning oh yes
you know Courtney and Kylie just got
together and we're like let's show the
family how it's done oh my gosh
and that burn is on fleek as for the
final step the lips this collection
contains a three lip colors the nude
color is called French kiss and this is
part of the pink set Minnie is part of
the green set and my personal favorite
because look at this color it is so
bright it is so intense it is so Fussell
this is called rad and this is part of
the blue kit so when we look at the
three colors I feel like they all three
go really well with this I look I think
mini the least so that leaves me with
French kiss and rad and you know what
that goes on extremely pigmented look at
that look at that a beautiful bright
orange red okay so that concludes this
looks I'm famous for any sentence Berg
alrighty guys so that is my look using
the brand new court Kylie Jenner
cosmetics what that is my look
completing the court and Kylie cosmetics
collection so overall okay I'm really
liking this collection I haven't felt
that spark with Kylie's collections
lately because to me they were all a
little bit boring and we've seen it
whereas with this one I'm loving the
packaging does it look a little bit like
kids makeup yes it does
but I don't mind that I love the pastel
colors one of my favorite parts is the
holographic Ness surrounding the
eyeshadow shades that's one of my
favorite parts about the packaging I
feel like the quality has
proved drastically I don't know what
they did I feel like the shadows are
more creamy more pigmented and just
they're way more powerful than they used
to be but what that comes is that they
do kick back in the pan a lot they have
a lot of Fallout and there's ways to go
around it you can do your eyes first
before foundation you can do the
slightest tap of you know the slightest
tap into the shadow in the palette but
not a lot of people like that I mean a
BH so close it's nothing like subculture
just let me get that out there but it is
like a cousin to subculture I don't mind
I feel like there's ways around it I can
work with it but I do want to put it out
there because it's gonna be a deal
breaker for a lot of people out there
my favorite polish is the blue I feel
like if you're getting any of these
palettes get the blue I feel like it's
the most versatile I feel like you have
the most options with this I'm living
for that yellow gold but can you find
these shades in other companies or other
you know palettes yeah if I would
recommend one of the palettes
is this one next up is the pink I really
like the pink but it's a little bit too
like it's three shimmer shades they're
all pretty light shimmer shades and it's
got that beautiful transition color
right here I feel like I would like this
for softer days so I just put that Sheen
over the lid blending into the crease a
little bit and then give that definition
with this color right here pop it on the
inner corners and it's a very light
shimmery sexy gorgeous day one palette
that I would not recommend and it's not
because of the quality it's not because
of you know it's just the colors this to
me is the Kylie Jenner naughty palette
in a mini version so remember the
naughty palette from the holidays I feel
like this is it in a mini-me version so
if you have the palette you definitely
don't need this one and I just I
I'm not feeling these colors too much
I'm not feeling this one I like the red
but I don't like the red in and of
itself because I have better Reds in my
collection
I like this shade but it's like whatever
and this shit is like whatever what that
comes that the eyeshadow palettes retail
for $24 each the liquid lives retail for
$16 each and with that my favorite being
then coming French kiss but you probably
have a Newt like this in your collection
and then many and probably have this
color your collection as well it's
nothing
revolutionary or new with this
collection but then again everything in
makeup has been done I feel like every
color every finish everything you can
think of has been done so I feel like
colors like this will do really well
because you know these are colors that
do really well in the cosmetic industry
they're nice they're good quality and
they're nice what I recommend him this
one yes fresh kiss maybe and many not so
much oh and I just found out that the
blue palette and the blue lips are my
favorites and they are sold in a sect
and if you want a bundle of the lip and
the palate that retails for $38 and if
you want the entire collection all of it
it retails for a hundred and eight
dollars so that is my play time video
