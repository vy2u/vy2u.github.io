video / first impressions of reviews or
swatches on the new Kylie cosmetics
birthday edition collection I've gotten
a lot of tweets and messages about doing
a video about this because I haven't
really seen a lot of people do a video
about this so here I am giving my two
cents and showing you what the products
look like on me and how they work for me
in a little playtime video so I was a
little dumb and I decided to film my
intro with my look on so this is what
you you'll be seeing this is what to
expect I feel like there are a bunch of
neutral colors in this palette but
somehow when there's a pop of color I
always want to go there so I went for
the pink and I just went ham with a
little bit of color because I've been
doing way too many brows lately so yeah
without any further ado if you would
like to know what this Kylie collection
looks like on me how they work what did
they look like what did they do then
keep on watching
alright so just a little heads up that
do have excessive powder underneath my
eyes to catch any fallout to just ensure
ourselves of a good outcome mirror so
going in with the palette and going in
with the color party time first and I'm
placing party time right on the outer
corners and blending all the way to the
inner portion of the crease
and although the shade is super super
pigmented I am experiencing fallout so
I'm very thankful that I have my nice
little secure layer up there now with an
Oprah 21 brush I'm going to blend and
smooth out the edges going in with the
Mac select cover-up concealer to carve
out my lid and after that going in with
the Queen altar globe in mint and this
might easily be one of my favorite
products of this entire collection it is
everything it's nothing new but I always
go a little bit above my natural crease
to help my hooded eyes out a little
oh my god I love those so much okay time
to get rid of the mess on the under eye
with all the sparkly nuts and a little
bit of that shadow ice will pick away
that under eye layer of powder so I'm
picking up a tiny bit of face powder and
just going rid of the mess for a
colorful liner today I'm going to be
using the matte liquid lipstick in
August bug for later
now going in with the new black and I'm
kind of blurring this in the crease
where party time is just looking a
little lowly
so right here I'm blurring in some of
the pink for a little pop I'm not taking
the new black and smudging it on the
outer till about halfway in on my lower
lashline and I'm applying it with this
Kylee brush and I think this is my
favorite brush of all the brushes she
has released in this collection because
it really blows up at lower lashline but
still gives definition continuing that
lower lash line using partytime on that
same brush send us off this look all I
need is some lashes and these are
ghalichi glam Lily lashes in caviar
caviar wet caviar caviar I don't know
and I'm going all-out for this look so
bottom lashes as well and these are
precious by HUD's of lashes alright so
either done and I am living for this pop
of color just a colorful glam so now
it's time to focus on the face since
this collection does have blue since
this collection does have the lush and
highlighter I do want to focus on the
face a little bit as well so first I'm
going to bronze using my hoola light
where is the shock
Emily what I've been doing is kind of
carving out where I shave I get really
excited and then I smile I'm going to go
right under this has been make of my
cheeks looks fab for blush like I said
I'm going to go into Cheers
now when watching these for the swatch
footage of this video I was a little bit
let down because like it's very sheer
and light but let's see what it looks
like on the cheeks I'm not seeing
anything come on come on so I'm seeing
like the tiniest hint of pink but it's
little like it's not a lot okay I don't
like this blush I mean that's okay for
this look because I didn't want a lot of
blush anyways because like I want all
the attention to go to the eyes but
usually I'd like a little bit of a
stronger blush alright so for
highlighter I am so excited about this
and I go in with birthday girl from the
palace but because I want it to be very
intense the goal is like what is new
here I'm going to go in with another one
of the hmmm I'm going to go in with
another one of the ultra glow pigments
this one is in the color King I love
that holy oh hello oh my god
okay so my only issue is in the light
it's fantastic but when I move away from
the light because I'm so fair it's
giving me a little bit of a darker gray
cast so I'm gonna have to lighten that
up a little bit you thing ever go ever
loves a little rescue like lighten that
edge up a little bit of fun tonight sir
I might be here okay that's
better
all right so let's move on to lips now
like I said before I want all the
attention to go right here so I'm going
to go for a more nudish color I'm going
to grab the Velvets now let me talk to
you when choosing between a velvet
liquid lipstick or a matte liquid
lipstick by kylie go for the velvet ones
they are way more hydrating they are way
nicer on the lips
they don't make your lips feel like a
dried up butthole and I just I
personally really really prefer that
formula over the matte ones because the
matte ones not all of them but most of
them are pretty damn drying so I'll be
going in with LA Velvets a liquid
lipstick
and now since this isn't really where I
wanted to take the look I'm going over
top with cupcakes gloss all right some
setting straight to lock it all in and
we're done and that guys concludes this
Kylie cosmetics birthday collection
playtime video slash review and swatches
another good stuff so overall I think
let's start with the palette I think the
palette is really really cute I live for
the glitter I mean you know this channel
you're watching right I live for glitter
when you talk about the palette I think
pigmentation is there and even when you
start blending all the colors they all
are different from each other whereas
with the bronze palette before once you
started blending everything added just
started looking with one brown color in
the crease I haven't noticed that
happening with this palette right here I
will say though you got a love pink
because there's a lot of pink rose
peachy tones simply you got to be a fan
of pink if you don't like pink eyeshadow
I don't feel like this palette it's
going to be for you the possibilities
are very very wide with this palette is
my favorite palette she's ever done know
you know especially with party time I
did notice a lot of fall out but you
know the pigmentation is there and as
long as you have that little secure
layer of powder underneath you should be
fine but it does this all out as for my
favorite products out of this entire
launch the ultra glow pigments these are
I think my favorite Kylie product next
to her blushes they are amazing they're
so bright they're so intense you can use
them as a highlighter in a corner lid
wherever you want it you can mix it with
your
nation but on the lid I feel like they
are shining like stars and even on the
skin they're doing a really really good
job so these are my favorite of the
entire launch if you're looking to get
anything in the restock go for these us
a loving cupcake gloss I really like the
kylie glosses because they're full of
pigment they stay on but they don't get
super sticky or weird or goopy they look
good say that's where the lip kit says I
feel like if you're going to have to
choose between the two go for the
Velvets because the formula is so much
better if you have the thing is with me
I always was team matte liquid lipsticks
by Kylie but as soon as I tried to
velvet I was like oh so that is what you
can do as well and it's so much better
so for me personally if you ask me go
for the velvet but again it's all
personal preference color wise like you
got to be a fan of the color because if
only two colors out of the six are
speaking to you we got to ask yourself
is it worth the money to get all six of
them when the rest you know when the
other four are rotting away you know and
I'm gonna leave that up to you it's all
personal preference but if you ask me I
would go for the velvet and maybe go for
the mats if you want to venture out into
a couple more bright colors because this
has bright colors in it as well as the
dark color yeah overall I feel like
those are the products that really stood
out to me from this collection and if
you would ask me Nikki do I buy this
entire collection I would say only if
you're a hardcore Kylie fan you love the
color pink and you love the matte
formula of her liquid lipsticks then
it's an absolute yes if you're on a
budget and only looking for a couple of
things I would say go for the ultra glow
powders maybe the palette if you love
Pink's or cupcake gloss I think cupcake
gloss and the glows are my favorite part
and then the palette and then the lip
sets and then the liquid lip kits yeah
that pretty much wraps this video up to
let me know in the comment section down
