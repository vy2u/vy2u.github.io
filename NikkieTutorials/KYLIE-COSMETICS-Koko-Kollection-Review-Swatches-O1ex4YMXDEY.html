trying this new thing of introducing my
name in every intro but it feels weird
so today I am here to do a full in depth
review flesh demo on the highly
anticipated Kobo collection by Kylie
cosmetics I'm in love with the Coco
Khloe Kardashian and Kylie Jenner have
collaborated before but they were like
that was really nice
let's do it again let's do it again so I
received a collection from PR and I
really wanted to put it to the test
today so they came out with at the bird
just diving into the review right now so
you know buckle up and sit down and get
ready so in this collection is the in
love with the Coco liquid lip collection
with the case course and in here we can
find three liquid lipsticks and one
gloss and the names of the liquid
lipsticks are bunny baby girl and dull
and the gloss is called sugarplum then
also in this collection is a pressed
powder palette and when we open it up we
find one blush two illuminator flash
highlighters and a bronzer so I'm really
excited to see what the palette will do
for my fair skin tone and what the
colors will look like on me so that any
further ado I'm just going to play with
the palette and apply the lip colors and
let's dive into makeup and enjoy finding
out about new products that hopefully
are really good I have no idea where I
was going with that so I'm going to be
playing with the palette first so when I
open it up I that blush is screaming my
name the blush is called Rodeo Drive and
it's like a bright peach pink coral mix
of a match
with like a golden glimmer a sheen to it
so I think that's going to be beautiful
on the cheeks the first let's do a
little bit of bronzing using Hollywood
Boulevard and Hollywood Boulevard does
have a little bit of luminance and like
a shimmer to it I wouldn't really use it
for contouring because contouring is
like putting stuff away when shove stuff
into the darkness like your cheeks and
like
snatched some what I'm going to do is
warm up my cheeks a little bit using
Hollywood Boulevard using my flat brush
and just a tiny way I just want a tiny
tiny oh my god it picks up so much
product and like one go so that's
telling me that I don't know I don't
know what that's telling me and we're
just going to slightly warm up to see
how much warmth that added in just the
tiniest step so what I can tell from
this is that the bronzer is really
pigmented and intense if you like
bronzing and you like to have a bronzer
that's really pigmented this will do the
job okay I'm going to look muddy in two
seconds yet I'm just gonna stop it right
there I mean I have to soften that quite
a bit because on my fair skin tone warm
browsers like this can little muddy and
weird in two seconds if you use the
tiniest bit of it and then diffuse it
with another brush it works but if you
go ham with a browser like that offer
skin tone it's not going to work for
blush I'm not dipping into Rodeo Drive
and picking it up on a duo fiber brush
okay picking it up just a tiny bit
because it's looking very pigmented and
then just Oh cute
I think this will suit a lot of skin
tones because it's got that war it's a
really good color
now it's served with the highlight the
glow my favorite part always and of
course I'm going to go in with the
lightest shade which is called troop
Beverly Hills the other color the more
rose gold color and that one is called
Dino t1o and picking it up on a more
feet r36 fresh let's see if it's any
good oh come on
okay laughs the finish is reminding me
duh a lot of the Chi lighter and those
aren't my cup of tea all right am
applying layer number three of the
highlight now and I must say that it's
definitely there to be honest it's
growing on me the longer I'm looking at
it I'm like okay for softer but then
when the light hits you you're like
hello yes definitely growing on me like
I'm realize it has a beautiful like
candle lit warm golden glow to it
whereas on camera it's a little bit more
silver ish it's definitely growing at me
with three layers it's stunning one
layer okay let's to a little bit on the
tip of the nose see it works on the tip
of the nose really nicely Cupid's bow
see on the places where I'm like I'm
like okay if it's not like super
blinding it is doing things to me that
is like here on the center stunning so
here's what my face looks like with the
bronzer blush and the lightest
highlighter of the two I so candlelit
baby she's good it's good yeah approved
all right so now that we know what the
pressed powder palette looks like on me
it's time to move on to the lips and we
have Fleur lip options on the menu today
and the first color go in with is like
the purpley muddy color this bad boy
right here is called bunny yeah we oh oh
wait Khloe tweeted the reasons behind
the name Louie do some research be back
she called bunny bunny because her mommy
called her bunny since she was born
and her room was flooded with bunny
decor as well
alrighty bed
oh that pigmentation is doing things to
me it's one of those true classic
Instagram daddy colors like it's one of
those knobby pinky colors that every
brand has but this one is damn pretty
here is what bunny looks like on me it's
such a beautiful staple color to have it
feels a little drier but like also
really velvety so it's definitely on the
drier side of all the formulas out there
but it's not like bothersome so yeah
that's what bunny looks like all right
next up in line is baby girl and let me
let me get my descriptions again Chloe
caught this baby girl because this is
what she called Kylie righty then ah all
our this is coral hello cool alright so
it does look a little sheer in certain
strokes but then once you go over top of
it again like with a new stroke it kind
of gets rid of the Sheerness
okay yeah I'm definitely having trouble
with this color see how it kind of gets
rid of the color once you do that see
the thing with baby girl is that it
dries so fast probably because it is so
bright that once you're working with it
and one side of your lip is already
drying you're still working on the other
it kind of tugs and breaks apart the
product and leaving you with an
inconsistent opaqueness and I'm having a
little bit of trouble getting this
perfect even here right now you see like
a stroke of grey because it's missing
that coverage there so is it a fun color
absolutely but like it has to be perfect
in one go because if I would apply like
a second layer over top of this the
product would break apart and crack and
look really nasty so so far big girls -
not my favorites next up is the
showstopper for this collection for me
personally this is called doll and it is
a bright in-your-face orange and orange
is like Hello and research doll was
called doll because her fans are her
dolls and it's the best term of
endearment alrighty I'm so bright I love
it oh my god
holy
holy crackers how cool is that color
it's such a statement it's so
in-your-face it's orange but like it's
got a little hint of red to it really
highly enjoyed this color I Kylie highly
enjoyed this color it does have the
tendency just like baby doll to kind of
break and crack when you apply too much
product so even now after talking you
can kind of see the grayness poking
through a little bit like with baby doll
so I'm sad to see it but like the color
is so bright no one will notice I am in
love with this color like no it's not
the best formula select the color hello
and the last piece of this collection is
sugar plum gloss and Chloe called sugar
plum because her MJ called her this
sweet name so like with all my lip
swatches I put a little bit of a
foundation on my lips because I have a
really pigmented red lips of my own so
when you put a gloss over top it's going
to look a shade of red whereas when I
put a little bit of foundation
underneath it's really going to make the
color pop and you can truly see what the
pigmentation and the color is like so
same for sugar plum a little bit of
foundation and let's see what it does
I like this and as I was expecting sugar
plum is really glossy it's not sick but
it's almost at the point where it's too
glossy for my taste I can just tell by
the texture of the gloss and like the
way it's it's holding up on my lips I
feel like this is not one wearing at all
and this will go in two seconds
but that also might be because I use a
lot of this gloss to see what it looked
like so when you use less of this gloss
if you like it will stay in place longer
it's not going to slip this light as
much I do really love the color it's a
true like Kardashian color alright so
those were all the four colors in this
collection plus the pressed powder
palette and I think it's time for my
final thought let's start off with the
palette I think the palette is really
cool I love the blush color this
highlighter is rapidly growing on me
because I applied it to my chest and
like I feel golden it feels like a
little more dimmed version of citrine
buys you a it's what it's really
reminding me out but like it's growing
on me and I'm loving it the bronzer is a
little too warm for my skintone so I
don't see myself gravitating towards it
a lot but like I'm paper and I don't
expect a lot of people to be my skin
tone so I feel like the bronzer is a
very safe choice for like the medium
skin tones out there if you're darker
however this is going to be too light as
for the lippy is my favorite color and
this comes as no surprise is bunny bunny
is like one of those classic instant
hits like it always looks good on
everyone it's one of those colors that
just works for everybody out there so if
that one by far is my favorite formula
wise color wise I just have the most fun
with that one doll and baby girl remind
me a lot of each other formula wise they
need a little bit more love
and they can look a little grayish / if
they miss a little bit of opaqueness in
certain areas plus they're harder to
work with because once they're dry you
can't really go back in and work with
them because they'll crack so the
formula on those two is in my favorite
but I am obsessed with all the color it
is so good I can't get enough it's such
a statement for summer so I really
highly like it because of that fact but
isn't my favorite formula no and lastly
the Sugar Plum gloss I love the color on
me like I feel like a true glam doll
right now I just should have applied a
little less I feel like if you use as
little as you can with this gloss it's
going to stay on for hours unless you go
and eat something the color is beautiful
when you do that little Kardashian trick
by putting the gloss a little bit above
your Cupid's bow right here it's going
to give you that really nice soul of to
a fuller feeling and that pretty much
wraps it up is the face palette worth
getting I do think so I see myself
gravitating towards this blush and
highlight a lots of that alone makes it
worth it for me the lip kit collection I
am kind of in the air I love bunny
I love doll but it's not the best
formula I love the gloss I first see
myself gravitating towards the gloss and
bunny a lot in the future and doll is
one of those bright colors that's fun
for like events but you don't wear it
every day so then the choice is up to
you whether you think the money is worth
it for a color that you might not wear a
lot or for a formula that might not be
the best but looks frickin stunning so
i'ma leave that up to you
so the Coco collection by Kylie
cosmetics gets a big yes for me with a
couple of side notes for some of the lip
kits in here so that concludes this
