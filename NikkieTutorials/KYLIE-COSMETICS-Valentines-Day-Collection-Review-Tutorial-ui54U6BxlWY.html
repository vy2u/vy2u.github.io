featuring become a cosmetics Valentine's
Day collection Kylie and her team were
so kind to send me a PR package and
honestly I was shook to the core I was
shook till my split ends I was so
excited because I didn't expect it at
all I did want to order a couple of
things myself
including the eyeshadow palette and here
it is it is Kylie's diary and we open it
it's got some beautiful colors to
first-time blushes so today we're going
to be taking this palette for a spin
plus a new lip kit colors I am just so
excited to show you this look today this
was inspired by Kylie herself on the
promo pictures for this collection of
course with a little bit of an icky
twist to it but yeah it is Valentine's
vixen seductiveness pink smokey realness
I'm blabbing without any further ado if
you would like to know how to get this
look right here keep on watching so from
the kiss me eyeshadow duo I'm first
going to go in with the color main
squeeze and this is going to go into my
crease and for this look I kind of want
to create a rounded smoky eye so make
sure you don't wing it out too much but
kind of rounded in we're also going to
bring this crease color all the way to
the inner corner of the crease I really
give it a blown out hazy effect now I am
absolutely loving this color it is
pigmented it applies really easily and
smooth it is easy to blend out this
eyeshadow duo is bomb popping over to
the diary shadow palette and taking this
color right here called hard eyes and
I'm first printing this color on the
inner and outer corners then blend it
out and connect in the center of the
crease
on the center of the lid I'll be
applying heartbreaker and I am going to
apply a little bit of the mixing medium
to the lid because I experienced through
my other eye that it needed a little bit
of help and love
I feel like with the mixing medium the
color really translates and gives that
impact if you want to use a mixing
medium it would be a little gritty and
dusty and hard to capture so I feel like
with the mixing medium they're
phenomenal right at the edges where
heartbreaker stops I'm going to add in a
little bit of love potion for a pop of
neon pink hello patience
and going back in with heartbreaker to
make it a perfect blend now I'm going to
grab a poison berry from the smooch duo
and this is going on my lower lashline
and blurred out to smoky perfection
and then once I get to the inner corners
I create a sharp line to give the
illusion of a wider bigger eye and I'm
going to fill that gap up using a little
bit of glitter and white liner to finish
this look all I need is some lashes and
these are the ghalichi glam lashes in
lush
all right so I am absolutely loving
these eyes I am so so happy with them
it's like halo gone mad so now let's
give or taste a little bit of lovin
under the first contour using this Mac
blush in taupe for blush of course
another go into Kylie's Diary and I'm
going to go for the more peachy one
because I feel like if you do too many
pinks
you're going to look very pink and the
peach is called first date
that's not fitting for this tutorial
because you are going to wear this to a
first date and scare that boy or scare
that girl and go back to your makeup
where you belong that's a joke that's a
joke if you find true love get it girls
get it
I love the pop of peach on Achieva kind
of livens up the eyes even more the
brush is a really nice mix of the
imitation and like blend ability to
pigmented types of blushes in my opinion
aren't the best because you quickly
apply too much and it becomes too much
but this is a nice like even
implementation for it the cheeks which
is good for a highlighter since we're
all waiting for Kylie to come up with
chi lighters or clothes till that day we
wait and today I'm going to use this
beautiful stunning right here this is
lazy wait it is called rose quartz this
stuff is so blinding so beautiful it is
now back in stock after being out for so
long
and I went for a more pinky tone because
I feel like it would weak super pretty
with the eyes so let's blind I haven't
really been able to like dig into this
because it was out of stock and I like
hate like painting you using it knowing
that you cannot get it but now that it
is back No
and of course I'm setting free to melt
this all together and make it look
flawless
the Philips I'm kind of struggling over
here because I have the minista truth
from and I'm really leaning towards
apricot or this one right here called
high-maintenance but I'm also really
really drawn to head-over-heels lip kit
oh but can we just talk about the
drizzling red glitter well since I've
taken inspiration from this shot right
here and here she's wearing head over
heels lip kit my brain tells me to go
for head over heels but like do you see
this lip color right here which is
apricot I don't know what to do all
right so we have apricot and I love this
we got high maintenance love that too
and we got head over heels all right I
think I'm going to mix high maintenance
with apricot
all right so here we have high
maintenance only I really really like
this color although I think with the
eyes is a little bit too much pink so
I'm hoping that apricot is just going to
make it perfect
all right all right I like I kind of do
want to see what's head-over-heels now
to you so let's just take this off see
what head-over-heels was like and then
we make a choice
Oh baby I think we have a winner in
head-over-heels love this color
and that guy's concludes this tutorial
inspired by Kylie from the Kylie
cosmetics Valentine's Day collection I
must say I am I'm done I'm done I'm
living for this look I love it so much I
usually never love pink on me it's just
I look like an albino bunny but yeah
