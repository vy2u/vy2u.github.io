Kylie Jenner so Kylie is coming out with
a new metal matte lip kit called majesty
and I saw some posts of it online and I
think that color is so edgy so different
and so beautiful but it isn't out yet so
in this tutorial I kind of made my
do-it-yourself metal matte lip kit and I
was inspired by her makeup look right
here where she's wearing the lip kit and
I like this because all the attention
goes to these beautiful lips and the
eyes are super flirty and still natural
so if you've been wanting a natural look
from me there you go oh my god quickly

is a selfie ring light you clamp it onto
your phone like that it's light and
honestly it's amazing so this right here

bought this and I loved it and I posted
about it on snapchat and after I talked
about it on snapchat a lot of you wanted

jump right into foundation for this
tutorial I only use my ex1 invisi wear
foundation in f-100 this is one of my
all-time favorite foundations I use it
all the time and I've been told that
Kylie actually wears this foundation a
lot for photoshoots so that tells you
that it's great for camera plus I also
found out that Britney Spears wore this
foundation at the Billboard Music Awards
this year
I just love this fundation it just gives
the perfect amount of coverage while
still making you look like a human being
I just wish they were like more
available in stores but for now I always
get it from look fantastic calm and I'll
put a link down below where you can get
it for concealer I'll be using buy buy
under eye by a cosmetics than the color
light first highlighting my face using
the Kryolan TV paint stick in 0/0
and again noting that in using a beauty
blender
and I'm going to set my under eye area
using the NARS soft velvet loose powder
in snow I'm going to start off by
priming my eyelids using my Mac soft
ochre Paint Pot and a stigma 3d HD
precision brush announced that increased
Sorel bone area using a light matte
eyeshadow now this tutorial is going to
be super duper easy so we're going to
take carroty eyeshadow in superfreak and
this is going to go on the lid all the
way blend it up into the crease I'm
using a Mac 213 to a place to Creek on
to my lid blending up into the crease
I'm lending it into the crease using a
morphe m 513
now going in with a morphe mb 23 to
really blend out the edges now I'm going
to go ahead and also apply keratea
superfreak
all over the lower lash line and for
this I'm using a Mac 228 and to avoid
having any gaps of skin tone coming
through I'm taking a Smith 212 brush
with that same color and filling up all
the gaps to define the lash line I'm
going to go into the jeffree star beauty
killer pallid and taking the color
vanity and for this I'm using a morphe
m51 5 brush it is very lightly you start
building a definition on the outer lash
line and tapering it out and in I'm
highlighting my inner corners using a
mixture of Northeast porcelain and
colored rain clutch curls my favorite
quickly opening up my eyes using the NYX
jumbo pencil in milk and now finishing
off using some beautiful flirty lashes
these are Lily lashes in opulence
alright after working on these two
flirty eyes it's time to slay our face
first I have a contour using my Kevin
Kwan medium sculpting powder and my
favorite orphée contouring brush my my
30
I know with my his way by 140 brush I'm
going to pick up a little bit more foot
powder tap off the excess and nail this
contour a little bit more right at the
base and blend out with another brush
your face powder go underneath and tap
at the edges to blend it and kind of the
base as well to make it softer you my
dear are left with ASA laying cheekbone
for blush I'm going to wear one of my
favorites ax1 pretty in peach and
applying it using my morphe M 509 brush
for my glow today I am so excited to be
playing with my jeffree star skin frost
I'm obsessed with these and the first
color I'm going to go in with as a
pretty warmer upper I'm gonna go in with
peach goddess first and of course using
my favorite highlighting brush my morphe
M 310 so with peach goddess from my
blush I'm going to work it up to my
highlighting areas so blush first going
up to my highlight area
these eyeliners are insane I actually
was lucky enough to play with these when
I saw Jeffrey when we filmed our five
minute makeup challenge and already then
I fell in love with them got the chance
to really play with them and see what I
thought I swear to the Gullwing gods
that this highlighter is one of the best
formulas out there so after we've played
with peach goddess for a little bit now
I'm gonna go in with ice cold my
absolute favorite same brush and really
blind the haters out there
I am dead and I let my nose just
stop
mm-hmm yep it's Bo of course and this is
all with ice-cold peach goddess was just
to brighten up that cheek a little
highlighting gods
thank you for Jeffrey star all right
time for the fun part besides the
highlighter time for the fun part the
lips and we're going to be creating our
own do-it-yourself kylie jenner lip kits
Kylie's coming out with a new net metal
and it's called majesty and it looks
like this and I think it's awesome that
Kylie came up with this super edgy color
and since it's not out yet I'm going to
create my own lip kit by creating this
lip using my own little product stuff is
going to go in with a black lipstick
this is a liquid lipstick by Oprah and
this is in the color the Bronx
all right after that it's time to give
that beautiful shine and glitter the
metallic Ness of course and for this
infer is going to go in with the dose of
colors pigment in stellar and as a
mixing medium I'll be using the Urban
Decay all nighter makeup setting spray
to make sure that this metalness doesn't
come off so it made my little mixture in
here and then we apply it
all right now I added a little bit of
Matt reflux teal into the mix to
highlight the center of my lips
and that will give it that beautiful
blue shine that kylie's lip kit had and
that's the guy she just made your very
own Kylie dinner metal matte lip kit and
