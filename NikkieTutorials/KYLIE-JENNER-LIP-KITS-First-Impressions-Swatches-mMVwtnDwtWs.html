it is officially October and October is
my favorite month of the year we all
know why Halloween and if you don't like
October
I am hardcore judging you right now no
shame I'm judging you you should be
ashamed I am so excited for October
because this year I decided not to play
around every year on my channel I have
like so many Halloween ideas and I
always run out of time and I only upload
like two or three or maybe one Halloween
make the trial but this year I am ready
to go in and kill it get it kill it I am
like so ready to start busting up the
fake blood and the creepiness but before
we do that today I am here to finally
share my opinion on the Kylie cosmetics
lip kits now a lot has been said about
Kylie cosmetics Kylie Jenner in general
and I never really felt the need to buy
her cosmetics or to like give her my
money but I don't know if it's just me
but lately I've seen this change in
Kylie where I feel like she's taken this
company and her line a lot more
seriously and I feel like she puts a lot
more effort into it than we've seen from
her before I just felt like when the the
line first launched it was like yay I'm
doing love sinks yay and I felt like she
wasn't really invested in the company
but lately like on snapchat and like
from like seeing her face you can tell
like she's way more invested and like
interested and she's putting in effort
and I respect that and that inspired me
to finally give her my money and show
you my 100% honest and raw first
impressions and review on these now I
have tried one color before which was
like 3-4 weeks ago which was Malibu and
I had a really good experience with that
so I'm hoping that all six of these will
give me that same experience when Kylie
first launched her lip kits I was one of
the first to tweet saying I've heard
that it's just color pop repack
I feel like a douche because of that it
was so unnecessary for me to tweet that
now after me a lot of people tweeted it
and not just coming from me but a lot of
people heard it and I just want to
apologize for saying that and bringing
that out in the universe because I had
no idea what I was talking about it was
so stupid and I apologized for that I've
never really had a great experience with
the ultra matte liquid lipsticks my
colour-pop I really disliked them and
Malibu was way different and I had a
great experience with that so nobody
knows nobody knows if it is just
repackaged colour-pop they might share a
lab you we we don't know though it was
stupid for me to talk about it and let's
put it in the past I'm excited that with
this video I can finally have my own
opinion I know so many people have an
opinion on Kylie Jenner and her cosmetic
line and I feel like there is so much
talk about it but like I feel like most
people just make negative reviews to get
views I want to form my own opinion I
want to make my own decision if I like
these or not and I have six colors to
show you today these are the six I'm
going to be showing you today and I'm
excited and I'm ready I would any
further ado let's do it alright so the
first color I'm gonna try oh my god
alright so the first color I'm going to
be trying out is Kristin crystal lip kit
is like a warm Rose nude pinky rose
beautifulness and all lip kits come with
a lip pencil and a liquid lipstick so
you buy them as a kit you get these in
your package you can also buy them
individually first I'm going to go in
with the lip pencil oh babe
okay yeah right off the bat amazing
color payoff super easy to work with
nice now I always sign the sides of my
lips and the bottom never the the
Cupid's bow because I feel like it makes
me look a little bit too fake um so
that's what I'm doing today
okay this lip pencil is no joke
it is pigmented intense and stainle easy
and soft to work with it just glides on
this is amazing and then now let's go in
with the liquid lipstick oh wow okay
amazing color payoff amazing it smells
like really sweet candy which I love
look of me I love that so no hate here
look how easy that color is just
applying to the lips without any
streakiness without any patchiness it's
even and pigmented
okay so that is what Kristin looks like
on my complexion I think it is a
stunning color the drying time on this
is super super fast I feel like as
you're applying the lip it's already
starting to dry and lock in place now
with some liquid lipsticks that can be a
problem because liquid lipsticks are
hard to layer once it's like actually
set and dried in it is hard to apply
another layer because they will just
gunk up and become one thick chunky
goopy mess but I felt like with this
even though it was drying already on one
side of the lip and I was still playing
it to the other side of my lip once I
did my final swipe over the entire lip
it didn't do anything weird I feel like
the coverage is insane it feels very
thin I do not see any streakiness
patchiness unevenness it just applied
smoothly and beautifully in one layer
and I know that talking from experience
with Malibu this gets super dry but they
don't dry out the lips or feel
uncomfortable so they are thin intensely
dry but not like irritating or like
drying it's just it yes I know people
are like waiting for me to say something
negative but Kristen so far is awesome
and I love the color love in between I
always apply a little bit of foundation
with my Beauty Blender instead of with
powder I do this with any lipstick so I
think it's fair enough to do this with
Kylie's lipsticks so that will cancel
out because I have very pigmented lips
so I want the true color and it just
okay alright next up is court K and this
is I believe one of her darkest colors
and this is like a dark vampy purplish
eggplant hugs blood color magic I know
that the lip liners are awesome and I
never really apply lip liners before I
do liquid lipstick so I'm gonna skip
that all right so Kourt can you're up
next
hello fall I love that color okay off
the bat I can tell that this is a little
bit more sheer see how my own lip color
is kind of coming through whenever I
swipe the product I see how it's kinda
peeking through right here so I
definitely used to jest applying two
layers with court K for sure yeah it's
definitely a lot less pigmented then
Kristen okay so I'm just gonna let this
dry for a little bit but so far it is a
little bit more streaky than Kristen a
little less pigmented all right so let
me just apply a second layer now okay
I'm just noticing as it starts to dry
and I'm talking a little bit more the
unevenness and patchiness is rising back
up alright so I brought you in a little
bit so see right here
oh it's blotchy and wait if I put my
flash on it is they're really gonna
reveal everything like see how uneven
and patchy like a big uneven patchy spot
here it's just nothing no I'm not I'm
not a huge fan of this color even taking
it off it's so crumbly it's like it's a
crumble city like it doesn't come off as
a color on my wife it comes off as
chunks of product onto the next one
exposed now I got this because I love
new liquid lipsticks but I do feel like
their one is not the hardest colors to
make because neelima lipsticks kinda
have the tendency to really gunk up on
that inner rim of your lips and become
goop City and I have only like a handful
of liquid lipsticks nude liquid
lipsticks that don't do that so I am
really excited to see how exposed will
do
okay already so much softer and like
easier to work with in court kay ah the
pigment is there and it's not playing
around it glides on super pigmented soft
easy to work with
it applies super rich and pigmented very
soft very thin it feels a little bit
thicker than Kristen like the
consistency is a little bit thicker and
I also feel like it needs a little tiny
bit longer to dry which I like because
it gives you like a little bit more play
time I hate the color on me like no joke
this color is colors I run away from
screaming because I think they look
hideous on me but on a more luxurious
deeper skin tone this will really pop
and look amazing I really like exposed
just not the color but the consistency
is awesome alright the next color we're
playing with is Posie K and my good good
friend Kim Thai loves this color she's
like so obsessed with it it is a
beautiful pink rose nudish color hose ek
here we go mmm okay Posie K
okay beautiful pigment very strong
pigment very thin very lightweight it
has a faster dry time than expose it
reminds me a little bit more of christen
formula wise I love the color
alright I definitely understand now why
Kim loves this color it is one of those
classic Instagram baddie colors I love
that it is super beautiful and like it
girl nude and pinkish I don't see any
unevenness or patchiness it looks
beautiful one of my favorites alright my
lips are dying but we're not giving up
next color is coke okay and I think pose
decay coke okay and candy cake we're the
first three she ever launched so I'm
glad I can show you - oh jeez candy K is
like pose DK but less pink more on the
neutral side it has the same depth like
darkness of color I think this is
another one of those beautiful Instagram
nudes that a lot of the Instagram
baddies wear and look absolutely hot and
follows and so yeah let's give Kandy K a
whirl we're all another favorite of
Kitely okay same same same as Posie same
as Kristin it is the same consistency
okay that is a stunning nude color
all right I think that looks stunning in
just one coat it has the same
pigmentation as the good ones so far
I've only disliked portkey but all
others that have tried are absolutely
amazing they are lightweight thin
buttery they dry fast and I just I am
obsessed with this color I think this
color is so beautiful all right my lips
are so ready for this to be the final
one the final one is 22 which is a
beautiful orange toned red oh my pardon
on the outside box it looks like a true
orange toned red in the container right
here it looks like an orange like
there's like there's not a lot of red in
here it just looks Orange which is fine
which is fine it's just I really
expected red final moment of truth with
22
mm hi okay so consistency wise it is
stunning oh my god it is stunning
applying 22 it feels a lot more dryer
than all the others the others feel very
wet and they glide on very easily and I
feel like with 22 it feels a little bit
more dry when you apply so when I first
did my first like swatch on the lip it
felt a little bit more dry so I was like
oh boy this is not going to end well but
it it just needs a little bit more
precision because it is dryer it has the
tendency to kind of be wobbly at the
edge but so far it's looking pretty damn
slick if you ask me so it's definitely
drier in formula but it doesn't like
lack in pigmentation Oh like man I am
living for this color you guys I love
this color this is my favorite so those
were all six colors that I have for you
to show you here on camera now I think
they all perform really really well
except for Corki if you want to buy
quark eight please delete that out of
your card because it's not worth your
money but all others I feel like have an
amazing consistency amazing formula I'm
repeating my own words all throughout
this entire video because I think the
lipsticks are great the lip liners are
fantastic I am personally not like a
huge lip liner wearer myself that if you
love lip liner or you feel like you need
a lip liner to function these are
amazing amazing amazing and it's gonna
be really really honest with you I feel
like people give her way too much
just because her name is Kylie Jenner I
do not have any aspirations to be her
new best friend or to like liquor
asshole but I feel like a lot of people
give her because her name is Kylie
Jenner but on the other side a lot of
people give her so much love because her
name is Kylie Jenner so I kind of feel
like you either love or you hate her but
I feel like if we're talking about her
lip kits as long as they don't go for
Corky you are fine because these haven't
amazing formula they said well on the
lips they stay there they feel nice and
thin and dry but a good dry not like a
drying dry and I just if I had something
bad to say about this I would have told
you about it but I haven't got anything
to tell you other than that I'm really
impressed by these I think my favourites
definitely have been Posey cake candy
k22 and uh Kristen I've really really
liked those I'm not the biggest fan of
exponents because I think the color
looks hideous on me and Kourt K we don't
even want to talk about core K right now
so overall the lift kits by Kylie Jenner
get a yes from me I know it's shocking I
expected something way different myself
as well trust me I expect it to be a lot
more negative throughout this video as
well because I didn't have high
expectations at all but she totally blew
me away with these and good job Kylie so
