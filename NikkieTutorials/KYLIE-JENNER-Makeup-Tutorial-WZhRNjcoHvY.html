inspired by a Kylie Jenner look I saw
floating around Instagram lately this
look right here was mainly inspired by
this look by kylie jenner and her makeup
artist actually was kind enough to share
a list of products to use on her
Instagram page on the post itself so I
just gathered all the products that I
have from that list and tried to come up
with this Kylie Jenner glam I really
like it I hope you like it too and if
you want to know how to give this look
right here then please keep on watching
prior to filming I already went ahead
and moisturized my face using the
Cetaphil hydration lotion and I'm now
following through with my Smashbox photo
finish primer water for foundation I'm
going to make a mixture between my Born
This Way ivory foundation by Too Faced
and my co Gondo aqua foundation in 213
and I'm applying this mixture using my
morphe East expression
for concealer I'm going to use my Urban
Decay Naked skin concealer in fair
neutral
and buffing this in using a real
techniques sponge
first things first I'm first gonna prime
I'll it's using my Mac soft ochre Paint
Pot for my eyes today I'm going to use
the Tarte tartlet eyeshadow palette and
for my crease I first going in with
force of nature and wonderer so I'm
going to start out by brushing those two
colors on the outer corner of my lid and
then sweeping it into the crease about
halfway and you don't want to go any
further than this and then also flick it
out because there was a definite sort of
wing with Kylie's eyeshadow shades well
little by little start diffusing it out
and wing it up and out a bit then from
the same palette and using power player
and dreamer and just going to darken it
a bit more so just again starting off
like that outer corner of the lid and
then working my way up to the crease
softly and then lightly flick it out
very softly into that wing and for this
I'm using a morphe m-phy 14
for the lower lash line I'm going to
take power player only and a max 228 and
just buffing it on the inner and outer
corners and just blending it in between
a little bit and using a Mac 239 just
softly blending that out for the lid and
first going in with the color pop super
shock shadow in a maze and just applying
it using my finger and also popping that
same color on to the center of my lower
lash line and then for even more
highlight I'm taking another color pop
super shock shadow and this is fringe
and I'm applying this using my Mac 242
not to hide the lash bend a little bit
more I'm just applying some black
eyeshadow using a morphe g28 and quickly
following through using some black eye
Kohl on the waterline to finish the
eyelids off and are gonna apply some
mascara to top and bottom lashes and of
course follow through with falsies the
falsies I'll be using today are by Hooda
beauty and these are the mink lashes in
Brigitte and that is what is going on my
eyeballs okay so for cheeks I'm first
gonna bronze myself up because Kylie
equals lots of bronzer in contour the
products I'll be using for this are the
Tarte Park of Prince says bronzer for
that extra bit of warmth I'm going to
use give me Sun by Mac
then Kylie definitely has warmth from
her temples down to the highest point of
her arch so this region
it's a contour i'm using my weeks i
shadow by bobby brown then for blush i'm
gonna go in with the girl and a chic
pink blush and I'm gonna use this color
only and then of course it shouldn't
come as a surprise to highlight I'm
going to use mary lou by the ball
for Kylie's lips to Anasazi Beverly
Hills liquid lipsticks were used the
ones used were sepia sepia and up the
center of the lips they used dusty rose
so these to make the Kylie lips from
that picture
