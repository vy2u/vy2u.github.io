now I'm not wearing any extensions and I
feel like an old man
I absolutely love Cathy I just found out
about her like three weeks ago I saw LA
Ink for the first time on TLC never saw
before loved it so I was drawn to her
face like her makeup is amazing and when
I was in New York a couple of months ago
I saw her makeup cosmetics and I
absolutely loved it so today I'm gonna
do a look inspired by Kat Von D um so
yeah with the with a really heavy
eyeliner and the round smokey of the red
lips if you want to know I did this look
then please keep on watching so the
first thing you want to do is a PI base
your eyelids to prevent the eyeshadow
from creasing and the one I'm going to
use is my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot I
know that Kat Von D has her own primer
in her makeup line at Sephora I don't
have it the first color I'm to use is
this Inglot pallet ban having you can
custom make your own pellet setting lots
of freedom system pellets and I'm going
to use this color in the middle as a
base and that is number four six one
yeah four six one four hundred and sixty
one
ding-ding-ding-ding-ding I'm just going
to pile it on my lid and like halfway
across now I'm going to take a sadhana
lace crease brush I absolutely love
their new for tech brushes there I have
friends I absolutely love their new for
text brushes they are so good and such a
good quality so definitely check them
out I will put a link in the bottom bar
and with that I use this kat von d
palette in true love and I'm going to
take the color right here which is the
brown and that is called rehab and what
Kat always does with her crease is she
always keeps it round and then with the
pointy eyeliner it really
gives it that unique shape so what you
want to do is you want to apply this a
crease color round like in a C shape so
I'm going to start a good putting it in
my crease right here and keep it round
then I'm going to and then I'm going to
go to my bottom lid and just connect it
and make it round then I'm also going to
brush them on to the lid some of that
rehab and then I'm going to take my
English color again and my favorite
blending brush which is the Mac 224 and
just blend it out until it's soft
then because cat loves some black I'm
going to take Lucifer which is the black
color and I'm just going to make that
outer part a little bit darker then I'm
going to take a little bit of rehab
again and brush it on the lower part
then I got to take peanut which is from
the pallet as well and I'm just going to
brush it on the inner corner of the eyes
to open it up a little bit and cat loves
some shimmer over there and then I'm
going to go back with the Inglot color
on my lid and back with the darker
colors in my crease so the the highlight
doesn't go everywhere now if you're done
with this you can see that the eye is a
really rotten shape and then with the
liner you're kind of giving that unusual
kick so the eyeliner I'm going to use is
my favorite the Inglot one the AMC
eyeliner gel mat is 77 the black and I'm
just going to make a liner but you kind
of want to make it really like going up
so you want to go a little bit further
up than you normally would and don't
really make that line straight but kind
of make it like curvy so it gives really
that kick like a really cat eye
now go ahead and take a black coal and
make your one on lines as black as you
can you wanna like you want it to be
black like a black hole okay what I'm
not going to do is throw my lashes and
apply some mascara and the mascara I'm
using is smoky lash by Makeup Forever
and then it will be back for the lips
okay for lips if you want to keep this
more wearable for like a party or
anything then you want to keep it like
this and add some new clips or just a
gloss but if you really want to make it
a Kat Von D look at some red lips or
like those um those Beijing nudie coral
lips absolutely love it I'm going for
that today because that is what I love
on the right mixer so unique for that
I'm going to use Kat money lipstick in
hell bent hell bent
ok guys so that completes this Kat Von D
inspired makeup look on I absolutely
love Kat and I hope that you enjoyed
