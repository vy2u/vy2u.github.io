which I am so SuperDuper excited about
last night it was Sunday fourth of July
and in the Netherlands it was a season
fine it was a season finale of The
Vampire Diaries now if you follow me on
Twitter you know that I am obsessed with
this I I eat breathe sleep live with the
Vampire Diaries
um every week I'm like is it Sunday
already because I want to see the
Vampire Diaries I am in love with the
Vampire Diaries I love the story
I love the season finale we had last
night Wow
it was crazy so I noticed it's gonna
sound so want to be but if there's ever
a director I don't know someone from the
Vampire Diaries watching this contact me
I want to be in your show I can be
pretty good I can be pretty good you
know like I can I can act - I don't know
if anyone ever knew this but I love
acting I can be like like like
Katherine's blonde sister who no one
ever knew about and she was a vampire
too and she had an affair with I don't
know what hot that's another vampire
that is new on the show - and we can be
a couple and then I can come back into
Mystic Falls and I can shake things up
while Catherine II starts to you and I
can with you - because I'm the glances
or no one would ever think I'm her
sister maybe in season two we can be
like like I'm in the kitchen - with the
Jonathan Gilbert I like catches fingers
or something I want to be on the show so
today I did a look inspired by Katherine
my sister and I love her industries
Natalie how she was like hello John
goodbye John's love that and I love that
she had a little bit more of a smoky
dark eyed and Elena does so um today I
tried to recreate
it is so simple it'll take you like five
minutes to do because we only using
three products all for five with iyi
mascara with it so it is really easy um
definitely check this out this is great
for school going to work it's really
great if you don't have a lot of time
I'm blabbing so much so thank you guys
so much for watching and if you want to
know how I did this is a minute if you
want to know how I did this now please
stay tuned I'm really not kidding I
really want the game intro
to start just look up you of course want
to apply a base to your list to present
your eyes from creasing I use my Michael
Todd nude eyeshadow cream eyeshadow
thingy it is perfect as the base and I'm
just going to apply some tuna lid and
just take my ring finger and blend it
out hello John bye John ah
the first thing I'm going to use is a
mineralized skinfinish by Mac this is a
light medium and you can use vanilla
eyeshadow but I think that's a little
bit too light
I just want my skin tone color just a
little bit more freshened up if you know
what I mean um you don't have to use
mineralized skinfinish um you can use
your face powder your setting powder use
that to apply teria eyelids it's really
easy I'm going to take a 252 by Mac and
I'm going to go into that minimize skin
finish I'm just going to apply that to
my brow bone and all over actually but
you want to apply the most of the probe
on and then go down now we're going to
use a color that anyone and everybody
should have in their collection as well
it's a light brown this is corduroy by
Mac and it is a light to medium brown
color it is a warm brown color so it has
red undertones and we're going to use
that I'm going to take it to a 17 by
Sigma and I'm going to go into corduroy
and I'll take that color and you're
going to go into your outer corners and
into your crease so I'm going to start
right here just wipe it down and then go
a little bit up and go into the crease
like that and I was just time to make
that darker and blend it nicely and
definitely don't make it too dark
because the look is really clean but
smoky as well but not smoke
as in the shadows increase before like
the liner now I'm going to take a 2:19
my Sigma and go back into my mineralized
skinfinish and make that lid a little
bit lighter now I'm going to take a
angles thin brush this is my stargazer
and we're going to grab carbon my Mac
which is a black color it's just black
anyone should have black too so we're
just going to use a skin tone color a
light to medium brown and a black hole
and everyone has those colors in their
collection so with that angled brush I'm
going to go into carbon and we're going
to use this as a liner and I'm going to
see if I okay I'm just going to push
this onto my lash line and go in like
that and then you're going to go out and
you're gonna smoke it out a bit so just
doing this just smoking it upwards okay
see that just smoke it upwards and out
can even wing it a bit cuz it's pretty
when you have a wing on your eye just
blend it make it smoky and nice and dark
and I'm bad and I want to kill you John
deal word now Freddie lower lid it's
actually really really simple you're
just going to take corduroy again with
that same angle brush just make sure you
wiped it off so the black for an out for
right now is off and you're just gonna
really closely to the lash line Pat it
on you don't want to like smoking down a
whole lot you just want to really clean
so just take corduroy and press set into
line and then go back into the carbon
and make that line even darker
and I got a tight line with my
waterproof eye pencil this is Buju um
I'm just going to tightline and everyone
that tight line is like the huh right
there and I'm using L'Oreal's
volume million lashes which I really
really love their free lips believe it
or not they are so damn neutral um I
don't think that Nina or Katherine is um
wearing anything on our lips I'm just
because I think her lips are not as
pigmented as mine so I'm just gonna take
my pale lip erase lip balm my Mac this
is on the lip erase I'm just gonna take
a little bit with my finger and just
make them a little bit more neutral so
they look a little bit more like hers I
hope you guys enjoyed I know I
definitely do not look like Nina Dobrev
or Katherine Elena but I just love this
show
I am so like into it if there's ever a
director looking at this I'm going to be
in it I really want to be in the show
question of this video if you could be
changed into a vampire would you do it
yes or no leave your answers in the
comment section below I would love to
know that thank you guys so much for
watching and I love you I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
