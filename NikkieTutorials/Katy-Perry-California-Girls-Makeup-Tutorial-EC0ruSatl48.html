inspired slash most recreated bike um
Katy Perry's California girls so if you
want to know how I did this like really
crazy look right
first colors that are going onto our lid
are two sugar pill colors this is Dali
pop and this is a poison plum yeah and
we're going to mix these two shadows
together to get the color that we want
so dip your brush into the poison plum
then into the Dali pink and then into
the poison plum again and apply this to
your lid
now just take that color that you
created and just go a little bit into
the crease now I'm going to grab this
226 by Sigma and go into poison plum
only and this is going into the crease
I'm going to grab my vanilla eyeshadow
by Mac and was a 213 by Sigma I'm going
to apply this to the inner corners of my
eye as well as my brow bone now I'm
going to take pink freeze by Max this is
actually my first Mac color I ever got
and I'm going to put this on to the
inner corners as well
over at vanilla and as well as the brow
bone
now I'm going to go back into the 226
and I'm going to go into poison plum and
I'm going to go into this Mac color it
is a pro color though and this is um
rose eyeshadow this I shot is amazing I
use it as blush I use it as I shall of
it so I'm gonna get that color and
applied is right here and with that rose
I shadow it's gonna give a really nice
Sheen shiny pinky effect you ever go to
MEK Pro make sure you get rose eyes
shadow and they can always go back into
the poison plum and the dolly pink and
make it more one-piece now if we're too
low early believe it or not she actually
wore a gold and Shawn plums my CD
so I'm going to start off with this warm
color on my lower eyelid this is Swiss
chocolate and just line your entire
lower lash line
and then wipe the brush off and go into
Mex golden mine and apply this under
that brown color then just take a little
bit of carbon which is a matte black
color and just tight line your lower
lashline to make it a little bit more
defined so once you have all of that on
it's time for the fun part which is a
big lata as my adhesive today I'm going
to use brow gel um just because I like
it um it works for me better than lash
glue or stuff like that so I'm going to
use brow gel so the Freys glitter we're
going to use is this color by Claire's
believe it or not it has a blue glitter
in it as well which is really cool
the second glitter we're going to use
this by Claire's as well this is like a
greenish opal color and then the third
glitter is by glamour doll eyes and this
is called um this is called rave
so with this brush I'm just going to go
into the brow gel and apply a layer onto
my lid
and then I'm going to go into the first
glitter which is that pink from Claire's
and I'm going to use some toilet paper
to cover up my face and then just tap
this on completely
like that I wet the brush up go into the
brow gel again and then take a raise
glitter go into the glitter take your
toilet paper and put this onto the outer
corners and blend it in then wipe the
brush up again go into the brow gel
cover up your face and take that light
greenie
opal pigment from Claire's and apply
this in the middle of your lid and to
the inner corners so just a little bit
here like that a little bit right here
of course Katy Perry wears her signature
winged eyeliner so I'm gonna grab a some
angled brush go into carbon the black
horror by Mac and just make a shadow of
how you on the line to go then go on top
with some liquid liner and then we would
do a whole lot of other stuff
what Katy Perry didn't wear in her video
but what I really liked was this second
wing I made from the lower lash line so
I'm just going to grab this angle brush
again from stargazer go into carbon from
MEC and just make a second line just
because I love it and it gets a little
bit more extra to the look so now I'm
going to apply two eyeliners to my
waterline I'm going to use my Stila
taupe has stood off and this Mac chroma
graphic pencil and pure Y you can only
see my nostrils in my mouth and I apply
some mascara I'm going to use the
L'Oreal voluminous and some black widow
manic panic fake eyelashes I'm going to
start off with my lip erase by Mac of
course
that's so hot then I'm going to take
this lipstick by Mac called rebel and
because that is a little bit too dark
for the look I'm just going to grab this
lime crime lipstick in century fuchsia
and I'm going to apply that to my top
lip I'm actually going to take that
centrifuge and apply that all over
another time so that completes this look
and I was done for the week okay okay
here we go
okay just release the hair but they are
slow girls let it slow just let it come
with the flow just release the poly
Pinsent keep the energy from flowing
around your hair oh yes oh yes oh yes
get the Hecht cap if that is what it's
called properly to pull it from the back
to the front and then it's time to get
your pink your yellow your lilac here I
don't know what color wig I chose my
lilac and just apply
I got this wick from eBay for like $15
um puzzle of shipping so I hope you
guys like it this was my Katy Perry
California girls inspired look um I
definitely liked it better with like a
lilac lip but um we got to stay true to
the look so thank you guys so much for
watching and I will see you guys next
time
whoo oh my god</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
