tutorial on Katy Perry's dark horse
music video I love Dark Horse the song
has been unrepeatable of prism my
favorite song of the album is legendary
lovers and next to that is Dark Horse oh
I was so excited that Katy did a music
video for it and the best thing is that
the music video worked it was super cute
I loved all the colors and the Egyptian
theme and I loved the makeup so today I
decided to come up with a tutorial
inspired by this look right here
still look where she's wearing the brown
wig with the studs in it along with
Juicy J next to her and I love it this
look definitely demesne some time and
patience but if you're ready for that
then please keep on watching ok so I
already put a base on and I use my Mac
soft ochre Paint Pot and I'm going to
make a mixture between Mac's deep truth
and Shop and drop eyeshadow
ok so first I'm going to make a line as
if it was my eyeliner for later on and
then from there it can really nicely
make that curve into the crease and go
about half way in so in the middle stop
then go ahead and thicken that up a
little bit and now with a pencil brush
I'm really lightly gonna blend that in
ok now a scary part comes going to take
more color on the pencil brush to
intensify and blend out really scary but
necessary okay now for the lid I'm going
to take two colors by Illamasqua
this is victim and this is Anja and
victim goes on the outer part of the lid
and onion the inner part and then you
blend it two together in a really nice
magical way ok so starting off with
victim apply that to the outer part
saying in between the lines which for me
was really hard when I was a kid okay
I'm going to take a little bit of Anya
and apply that
the inner part half section okay and I'm
going to heighten this up till the
crease of it so it matches that line or
that weird shadowy color in the crease
okay now take a bit more of victim and
start blending it into Anya so you have
a nice seamless blend okay not taking
the slightest bit of Anya again I'm
gonna blend this darker part out really
lightly like nothing too much but you do
want to blend it out a little tiny bit
so take just the tiniest amount of Anya
and give this a softer more blended feel
for my brow bone highlight I'll be
taking this pigment by OCC and this is
called obscure and obscure has a really
awesome green teal blue duochrome so
that is exactly what I want because I
felt like uhm the brow bone highlight at
Cadiz look was a little bit too much to
highlight this inner corner I'm gonna
take my the BOM sexpot overshadow
pigment in no money no honey just tap
this on this very inner corner here and
then blend up slightly for the blue
glitter I use a glitter buy lit
cosmetics and this is Elton John number
two and then for the gold on the inner
part I'm gonna take Mac's
glitter in gold and as my adhesive I
will be using the lit clearly liquid
glitter base first dabbing the adhesive
on to where I want the glitter to be and
then with that same brush pack up that
Elton John glitter and pack it on don't
smear it on okay and I just did the same
with the gold
and then because I like the gold and the
blue to blend in with each other a
little bit nicer I'm gonna go back into
the Elton John glitter and go a little
bit over the gold and that will sort of
make a gradient effect pack it on
slightly over to gold and that will give
a nice or nicer blend as far as you can
blend with glitter that is okay now it's
time for the liner and this is something
that's sort of really almost impossible
to explain what you want to do and I
won't be able to talk throughout it
because I will be so concentrated on the
liner I will not be able to talk what
you want to do is make a winged eyeliner
like you're normally would and then once
you have that wing on you're gonna take
a part back into the crease and then
sort of make that a thing and then you
want to look like this make a really
long sort of point on the inner corner
and go back onto your lower lash line
and the products that we'll be using for
that are my Inglot eyeliner gel in met
the AMC one and also the Makeup Forever
aqua liner in black
so this is basically what you want your
top part of the eyeliner to look like oh
my god now fill that in what you want to
do now is continue that liner throughout
the rest of your lower lash line and
once you're almost to the end you want
to lift it away from the eye and make a
line going parallel to the top
for the gap that we left bear here we're
gonna actually fill that in with some
glitter and for that I'm using a more
yellowy gold glitter I got this at a
craft store it's really finely milled so
I think it will be okay this will fill
up this gap right here with the same lit
clearly liquid glitter adhesive and all
that
quickly under what I line I'm going to
apply some Bend i neutralize a cream
crayon in ultralight and I'm just going
to apply some mascara and false lashes
the mascara we'll be using is my makeup
to be waterproof 3d extra black and the
lashes are going to be max 36 okay I
comes an even trickier part of the look
the designs under Katie's eyes so for
the right eye you want to do that very
Egyptian symbol thing and then on the
left eye you want to make a line
parallel to this and then at this part
it goes down a bit
we got that okay now the last finishing
touch that Katy Perry had was that same
gold glitter on the inner part of the
eyes was also in between these two lines
and at the sort of border corner of this
design so I'm going to take that mech go
the glitter again and then I think for
eyes which should be done oh my god
okay so first cheeks what I'm going to
do is first contour using my NYX blush
in taupe so just go ahead and contour
that face now I'm going to give my face
that Egyptian warms with my Illamasqua
blush in disobeyed I'm going to take my
Tarte Amazonian clay blush in a book
exposed and just a tiniest bit of that
and of course you want to give your face
that amazing glowy look so if we're then
going to take my neck extra dimension
skin finish in whisper of guilt ever
lips you just want to keep everything
really warm and nude and for that it
will be taking my Kiko rock Idol
dipstick number one and then to line it
out and give it a little bit more
fullness and dimension I will be using
the super saturated high gloss lip color
by urban decay in Glinda
