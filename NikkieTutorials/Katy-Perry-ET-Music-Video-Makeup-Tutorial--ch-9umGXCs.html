Katy Perry's 80 warrior look um I got so
many requests for this it's it's insane
like I got emails I got messages I got
Commons will you do an et look and after
that I couldn't say no so today I did
the warrior look that was my favorite
part of the entire video the video it's
kind of my ish to me but I loved the
extra singing part where she started
like today I'm doing this
et look and um if you want to know how I
did this then please keep on watching so
the first thing we're going to do are
the brows and the cars I'm going to use
for that are Omega I shadow by Mac and
charcoal Brown so with the Omega I'm
just gonna like put some darkness on the
front like the beginning of my eyebrows
just to make it more defined so once you
reach at the end straight out and up now
with Omega just kind of make a brow
shape into it then just one line now I'm
going to take a brush like this and just
kind of make it softer at the beginning
now just take some makeup studio brow
gel and just brush the hairs up for a
more kind of like warrior look and then
with their brush again and brush them in
place how you want them to end up
staying up and then I'm just going to
take some concealer and pop that right
under the brow to make it more defined I
already applied a base to my lips
presenta eyeshadow from creasing or like
anything that is going on top to not
crease so the first thing I'm going to
do is I'm going to take a Meg 266 and
we're going to cut the crease like
really
extremely and cut the creases like that
brown line is right there and for that
I'm going to grab em bark and bark hi
Mac I'm just going to take it and with
that you kind of want to go up row not
kind of go a lot above your crease and
then go all the way to the bridge of
your nose
I'm going to take my Sigma e45 and I'm
going to go in to mix a swiss chocolate
what I'm going to do is just blend above
the line just create depth go up in a
straight line and right here just make
it nice and dark and as if it is really
like deep set I can kind of blend above
this part right here as well doesn't
really matter I like it I'm going to
take this on makeup studio 18 color
eyeshadow palette and I'm going to take
this Mac 239 and I'm going to go into
the white and I'm going to apply that
all over the lid and to these inner fake
corners okay now I'm going to add the
like white thing she has on our eyes I'm
gonna use Illamasqua eye eye pencil in
elate and what you want to do is kind of
like draw ovals so it aren't really like
circles just like ovals
one put the brow right here I kind of
make the outline first and then fill
them in and with that white eye shadow
from the makeup studio pellet set it so
just set it with a white eye shadow I
would the Swiss chocolate kind of make
the brown fade into the spaces between
the white for more dimension into this
look once you have that on it's time for
the eyeliner and the bottom part what
you want to do is just with a 2:26 from
meg and some blackjack flute line create
an eyeliner then wing it out extremely
and then from the bottom connected to
the top
okay once you have the eyeliner on
you're going to take some brushes and uh
embark again and Swiss chocolate and you
want to make those shadows go from the
point of the line all the way into that
point so you kind of get what that you
long gated cat eye look I just kind of
place it there just kind of look where
you need it and go all the way to the
other line right here now take a big
brush like that and go in embark again
and then make that eye shadow meet up
with the eyeliner and wing out as well
now I'm going to take a sigma 219 and
I'm going into a Swiss chocolate as I
said and smoke it out even more but then
with the Swiss chocolate I'm going into
the black and I really make that inner
corners really dark and then make it go
to the embark and then make it go to the
Swiss chocolate so you really have those
inner corners like black dark brown
Swiss chocolate I'm going to apply some
mascara I'm going to use the colossal
volume Express by Medellin and some
lashes which are the UM makeup studio
number four for the brown print right
here I'm going to take a turban of case
a whiskey I pencil and then set it with
embark I shadow for the green I used um
stash by urban decay and I set it with
um cork I shadow from Mac and then for
it this was all brown too but I wanted
some color into it and for the orange I
use Allah mask as a roadie ah pencil
so Katy Perry kind of like those medium
dark brown lips I'm going to be honest
here if I apply medium round to my lips
I will look like I a I'm not
kidding I will look like I ate poo so
instead of the brown lips
I added some like pastel e pinky sweetie
lips to make this more appropriate for
my face I'm going to use um is naked lip
liner which is the bomb like next to my
lip arrays I found my new love which is
naked lip liner and then another new
love is um
playing coy lipstick from the quite cute
collection from Mac to die for I hope
