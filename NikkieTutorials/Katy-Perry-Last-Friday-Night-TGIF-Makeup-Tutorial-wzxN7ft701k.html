on Cape Aires um TGIF
was awesome I try to pitch my hair sort
of to to 80s I was still in my daddy's
peewee when the eighties were if you
want to know how I did this Katy Perry
thank God it's Friday
TGIF look then please keep on watching
or they apply to base which was too soft
ochre Paint Pot from Max now I'm going
to make a mixture between Mac's blue
sorcery mineral ice eyeshadow and Mac's
steamy and I'm going to put that onto
the lid now I'm going to take mix
nocturne nail it with a brush like that
you're just going to make a strong line
into the crease so you have something to
work with so just follow your crease and
go as far in as you like then with this
somewhat bigger brush I'm going to blend
it up it's okay if you leave the spot
open because we're going to work with
that later on but for now we're going to
take max stars and Rockets and with a
bigger blending brush we're just gonna
blend above the duct right now just to
give it that 80's like pinky feeling now
I'm going to take nocturne elegan and
blend that with the stars and rockets to
make it a nice gradient I'm going to go
back with that brush and make the outer
corner really like strong with the
nokton L so the darkest is right here
then on the brow bone I'm using a gold
highlight this is the MEK duo
illusionary burning ambition mineralized
eyeshadow I'm going to put that gold on
my brow bone for just place it under the
highest point of your arch then wipe
your brush off on a paper
towel and blend it in I'm going to take
another meal lice eyeshadow duo this is
TN sky and I'm going to mix the dark
blue with the blue sorcery again and I'm
going to put that on the lower lid and
put it right here
under your lower lashes then I'm gonna
wing that out by filling up that gap
that we have right there
so just wing it out and then you fill
that gap up and then I'm going to go
back with the nocturnal and just make
that out according it a little bit more
strong but okay now I'm going to put
some glitter on my lid I'm going to take
this glitter adhesive this is la splash
eyeshadow sealer base and then the
glitter I'm using is mixed turquoise so
I'm just going to pop that onto the
middle of my lid then on my waterline
I'm using a light baby blue eyeliner
this is LMS cos coax and that's pretty
much it for all the eyeshadows and all
the glitters I'm not going to put some
mascara on which is Meg's hot and not
okay for the lips its usual first take
some liveries from Mac I'm going to use
around three colors for the lips and the
outside I want to make like a neon
bright pink and the color I'm using for
that is very M's number 52 and I believe
that is called a shocking pink or
something so I'm going to use that on
the outside of my lips
then I'm going to take another berry and
lipstick this is number 100 and that
it's baby pink and that is going to like
the remaining parts of the lip and then
for a little bit of shine I'm going to
add a very M's lipstick in 1/32 and I'm
just going to Pat that in the middle
that completes this Katy Perry thank God
