makeup look that Katy Perry wore at the
Super Bowl halftime show I absolutely
loved Katy's look it was like pinup
showgirl on fleek
I can't we talked about Missy Elliott's
anyways without any further ado if you
want to learn how to get this makeup
look right here then please stay tuned
alright so the first thing I'll be doing
for my face is applying my primer / base
for the glow for the glow to happen so
the first product I'll be using is my
Too Faced and this is the hangover
replenishing face primer as a give
yourself that glow I'm using the Becca
shimmering skin Perfector in pearl so
just make sure is going right on to the
face okay then for foundation I'm gonna
take the Mac face and body in c1 and the
Mac Studio sculpt in NC 15 and a
subscriber commented on one of my last
videos that this combo is awesome so I
tried it and she was a superduper and
it's totally awesome it gives her face
it really nice glowy feel but still
covers and makes you look flawless so
I'm gonna be mixing these two together
and that will be my foundation and then
buffing it in with a brush and the brush
I'm using is by Sigma and it's the f88
okay once I've got that on I'm gonna
conceal and I'm using my Pro Longwear by
Mac and I'm applying this right
underneath my eyes to highlight along
the bridge of my nose forehead basically
basically everywhere not here and now
I'm taking my Real Techniques sponge and
I'm blending this all in
and then quickly I'm gonna set that
using my secret brightening powder by
Laura Mercier okay so first things first
I'm first applying a base to my eyelids
to prevent everything from creasing and
I'm using my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot
for this then with a large eyeshadow
brush and a light colored eyeshadow I'm
running this from the crease up to my
brow bone and what this will do is help
blend out the crease color easier
prettier and better the first crease
color I'm gonna take comes from the
Tarte tartlet pellet and it's this
greyish color right here and with a
zoeva 227 I'm gonna start applying this
to the crease and we're not really
cutting the crease but we definitely do
want a prominent crease so go ahead and
carve in that crease right here then I
also go ahead and wing that out just
slightly then with a light gray color
I'm gonna diffuse the edges and make it
look more soft and the eyeshadow I'm
using comes from these OFS smokey eye
shadow palette and it's this greyish
color right here for the lid on taking
this color by unassessed a Beverly Hills
and this is Blanc just pack it onto the
lid and for this I'm using a zoeva 234
for the inner corner I'm taking this NYX
jumbo pencil in cottage cheese as my
base and I'm going to set that using
makeup sitios dual effects and shine for
the lower lash line I'm taking this
brown from the tartlet palette and this
goes from inner to outer corner and then
with a pencil brush I'm gonna diffuse
that out and blend it a little bit more
down
and then now it's time for the winged
liner and the glitter liner so first I'm
taking my Kat Von D tattoo liner in
trooper to lay down a base for my
eyeliner and you want to go thick and
bold I'm gonna fill this in using the
NYC black liquid liner and then for the
glitter what you want to do is create
your own glitter eyeliner you can do
this by mixing a glitter adhesive with
the glitter so I'm taking the lit
clearly liquid glitter base as my
adhesive and the Glitter I'm using is
also violet and this is Marilyn Monroe
size number three so make sure it looks
like this and then with an eyeliner
brush you just want to apply that and
they can always go back in with the
black to clean up the black now I'm
taking the essence long lasting liquid I
pencil in hot chocolate and that is
going on my waterline okay now all you
want to do is finish off by applying
some mascara and falsies and today I'll
be using the hustle flashes ikonics
so for the cheeks first I'm gonna
contour my face using my
Illamasqua eyeshadow in heroine and the
first I'm using is by Mac and it's the
one 63 and Katie has killer cheekbones
so make sure that you work those
cheekbones in girl then I got the
further bronze up my face using refined
golden bronzing powder by Mac and I'm
using the Mac up cos oh one brush and
just a tiny teeny bit of this well
actually no because Katie with bronzer
on then for blush Katie were a really
nice grey peat pink and for that I'll be
using vintage grape ombre blush by Mac
and I'm taking the pink side only and
using a white hand for this because you
definitely don't want this just onto the
apples of the cheeks blending back into
the bronzer I mean using my Becca
shimmering skin Perfector in moonstone
just because this gives me the the most
outstanding glow of life so first of all
highest cheeks highest cheeks you know
the highest points of the cheekbones
this was a must for this look then also
bridge of the nose hey you know I have
to do this tip of the nose and just the
tiniest bit right here on the forehead
that's it that's that's it you don't
want any more globe
alright for lips you want to go for a
slightly darkened true red and for this
I'll be using Anastasia Beverly Hills
liquid lipstick and this is American
doll
and that guy's concludes this Katy Perry
