tutorial on Katy Perry's new music video
this just how we do to the name xes
always yeah but some of them says the
first time I did a full prism listen was
just Katy Perry's album eye and I
stumbled upon this is how we do
I just knew then and there that it was
going to become a single it's just it
had all that you know it had that
typical single vibe so now that this is
how we do actually came out as a single
I was like Jess I knew this was coming
so today I was inspired by the look that
katie is wearing in two of her outfits
the first one is with the blue wig and
the entire blue set and her blue outfit
oh I forgot my nose ring like that and
the other time she wear this look was
with the dark green wig and with all the
you know Chanel things surrounding her
so um that it's to wear that looked
twice and yeah without any further ado
if you want to know how to get this look
then please keep on watching
alright guys so let's get started and by
the way don't look at this don't even
want to talk about this one okay the
first I'm gonna do is prime and give
myself a really nice base to work with
and I'm gonna go for my Chanel Leblanc
and I'm mixing it with Becca shimmering
skin Perfector in opal and these two
together just make the most awesome base
to work with ever so that's going on my
face okay so I'm gonna start by just oh
I kind of like how that Chanel leblanc
has a white base because they're kind of
you know it gives you a little bit of
brightness and just goodness and if you
ask me that just leaves your skin
looking absolutely nourished and glowy
and radiant and and just I mean look at
the glow look at the glow girl because
we're doing a Katy Perry look today and
Katy does love her coverage I'm gonna go
for a quite coverage
coverage base and the foundation that
we'll be using is by l'oréal and this
is true match got a new one in c1 this
is the lightest color available in the
Netherlands where I live pretty far it's
all the time and just I'll be a plane
cuts with my finger placing dots and
then with a brush I'm going to buff it
in and today I'm not gonna go for my
makeup geek a foundation stippling brush
I'm gonna change it up a bit I'm gonna
go for the equivalent from Sigma this is
the f80 flat kabuki brush and I'm just
gonna you know both this bad boy and
with that I actually really like c1 as
well it's a little bit more yellow which
I like I'm building up where I think I
need it
you know I set this in a couple of
videos before and people were like you
don't need it anywhere else I'm like
girl I do girl just this one right here
though just a story
started out so innocent and small and
now it's like Godzilla on my damn face I
am now going to conceal for this I'm
using my Mac Pro Longwear in NC 15
so I'm starting underneath my eyes
dragging it up here I'm going to buff
this thing using my f-86 by Sigma and
chapter tip work work work land that in
another them to set this entire thing
using my chanel natural is finished
powder in number 20 Claire I'm gonna do
brows and one eye off-camera and then it
will be back so the first thing I did
was apply base to my eyelids to prevent
the eye shadow from creasing and I use
my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot for this I'm
now going to take these soft bucks a
tooth palette and I'm taking the white
and also be going into my Naked 3
palette and taking the lightest color
right here and I'm packing the shade all
over the lid up to the crease
and then I'm also with this going to
light up my inner corners and this to
really open up the eyes later on and
taking that strange color from the Urban
Decay Naked 3 only they're really
putting that on the inner corner and
can't you see how much that brightens up
the entire eye area I love it
I'm gonna take strange again and
concentrate it on my brow bone and blend
out softly now it's time for the pink
eye liner and because I didn't have well
I'm gonna go with a lip liner and this
is mex embrace me this is a lip pencil
but it does the job and you don't have
to go and buy out a liquid pink liner
for this especially because let's be
honest how many times are we going to
wear this look outside so it's really
important to keep the tip of the pencil
really fine and sharp so keep you know
sharpening it I'm going to start off
with my first line and then from there
go back on to the lid and this pink
liner can be very thick and dramatic
because we're covering it up with a
little bit of black later on as well to
sort of set the look a little bit more
so you can make this really thick and
even when going to the inner corner
even that inner corner has to be applied
very thickly
and I'm gonna take the Urban Decay
electric palette and I'll be picking up
a little bit of savage and with a really
sharp and precise angled brush I'm gonna
go over the pencil to set it and
intensify it so this way you won't get
any transfer and also with this you can
go ahead and even out and sharpen out
any lines that you feel have to be even
out and sharpened out if you can go
ahead and really get that flick in there
and make it super precise and thin and
what I especially love doing with this
is even that wing out even more
now before we focus on the black
eyeliner right here I want to focus a
little bit more on that line in the
crease this is very pinup II and graphic
at the same time and I loved that they
did this so I'm gonna go back into my
assault box pellet and they'll be taking
this gray color right here so you just
want to follow the shape of your eye
this goes like that that goes like that
it has a curve here it has a curve here
it goes out straight like that goes out
straight like that you don't want to
look straight into a mirror when doing
this because you don't want to place it
too high or too low
but you do want to go a little bit above
your natural crease so that when you
look straight forward it's a little bit
higher up
okay now that I do the black line right
here you want to keep it shorter thinner
and sassier than the pink one on the
outside wing you definitely want to meet
the black with the pink but not as long
as the pink and just overall keep it
thinner and shorter and the eyeliner I'm
using is dating Joe Black by Catrice
okay then I'm gonna go back into that
gray color from these soft bucks
a tude palette and I'm also gonna take a
little bit of makeup geeks unexpected
and I'm gonna take those two and run it
along my lower lash line really softly
you just want a little bit of definition
there to you know kind of ground the
look on the bottom a little bit more I'm
applying a nude eye pencil this is by
Catrice and it's called big bright eyes
okay so it's time for a mascara and
lashes for mascara I'll be using my
waterproof a 3d extra black by makeup
studio with a little bit of Mac's
extended play gigablack lash and lashes
is gonna be the XO Beauty glamour East
us okay so for ticks do you want to go
sculpted pink and glowy
so first kind of sculpt and contour
using my Illamasqua eyeshadow in heroine
I'm also gonna do my big old forehead
it's a tragedy for blush I'll be making
a mixture with the bombs down boy and
makeup geeks hanky panky and with these
two I'm not really gonna focus it on the
apples of my cheeks but let's say if you
contoured which I did you don't you
don't really have to do it but let's say
you have your contour that has a line
like that exactly above it in the same
line you want to apply your blush so I'm
taking a little bit and just following
my contour and buffing it in so the
blush has the exact same direction as
the contour plus it kind of melts in to
the contour as well then for my
highlighter today I'm gonna take the MUA
undress your skin shimmering highlighter
i I love this one so I'm just gonna pop
that on the highest points of petite
bones and kind of in the same line as
the contour the blush and then a
highlight so basically you want to see
it as contour blush highlight it's all
in the same direction
fur lips I'm gonna go with my wet and
wild doe house pink nine six seven
lipstick which looks like this
and this lipstick looks most like what
she was wearing with the blue wig and if
you want to go for that green look that
green wig look you want to go for
something a little bit more pinky
Coralie red and you just want to apply
it and then to match the pink to the
eyeliner a little bit more gonna take
embrace me lip pencil once more and kind
of you know choose it up between the mix
hmm and I kind of add it overall to warm
it up a bit so that guys concludes this
