also this is kind of like a modern cat I
was glitter on top of it um as soon as I
saw it I was like we're doing this video
video because it's so freaking cool so
the first thing for this cut off look
it's to apply base to your eyelids to
prevent that eyeliner from creasing up
to like your crease so you want to apply
base for weed not to happen so I'm
actually not going to use any eye
shadows because um curly was just really
clean and crisp and drunk so I'm going
to take my new favorite powder from Mik
this is the studio care blend and I use
this to set my foundation as well and it
is absolutely amazing if you want I can
do a review on this if you want me let
me know but anyways we're going to apply
the carob blend in I'm going to apply
line because I'm like take your powder
your face powder and just apply that all
over the lid now for the eyeliner i'm
gonna use mac's blacktrack fluid line
this is my most favorite eyeliner my gel
eyeliner that I have and I'm going to
apply that with the Mac 266 and this is
my favorite like eyebrow and eyeliner
brush it's like heaven on earth or like
Ke$ha with with the bottle of Jack so
first coat that brush with the gel liner
and you want to start making a line by
following your waterline so this is your
waterline the thing inwards
if you follow that it doesn't go like
that it goes up a bit you follow the
direction that it goes upward you see I
am following the direction now make the
line as long as you like I'm gonna go
pretty far out because her child had
romantic
okay now coat that brush again and what
you now want to do is like the the
simplest part ever from the outer point
of that line you want to go all the way
in to the beginning of your eyes so as
you can see here I took that point and I
went all the way in and you want to do
that with the other eye as well so I'm
going to do that and I'm going to talk
this I suck at talking and applying
eyeliner at the same time so at a point
in you see now I'm going to fill that in
with the eyeliner and all you want to do
is go all the way into your eye
so this is the basic thing you want to
do now of course as you can see I made
it way thicker at the inner corners of
my eye because right now it's thick
right here and SCIM right there so I'm
going to even it up and make it thick
everywhere
now Kesha actually had some glitter on
her black eyeliner which I love because
it really adds on to the look and it
makes it really like a party look and
different than just like your typical
cat eye thing so um what I'm going to do
is I don't have a silver sparkly pigment
so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna mix my
own I'm gonna take max dark soul pigment
which have a little bit of silver like
shimmer to it but not enough so I'm
gonna take mix reflex glitter and pearl
and mix those two together so you get a
like really shimmery black silver mix
and I'm going to apply that to the black
line and to make it stick I'm using my
makeup studio 2-way jell-o as you can
see I have a little bit of fallout so
I'm gonna take care of that right now
you're gonna make the upper waterline
black because if you don't do that you
have holes between your eye liner so I'm
just taking my Urban Decay zero and I'm
just making this part black
because else you're gonna see spots of
your skin through the eyeliner and that
means no thick black even coat and then
actually for the bottom waterline we're
gonna use a white ichael and this is mix
chroma graphic pure white and I'm first
gonna you know I do this and then that's
always I'm going to take my lighter and
warm it up so it saves on the bottom
waterline for the entire day and then
apply it now for mascara she didn't wear
anything like mascara on the bottom so
I'm gonna curl my lashes with my
japonesque power eyelash curler which is
amazing then apply mascara this is
makeup studio maximum volume and then
I'm gonna of course like I'm dropping a
penguin now and then
of heights of fake lashes these are max
number two and I cut them in half and
then put them over each other so it's
like a corner eyelash but really sick so
that is oh yeah right
and I'm actually going to apply that to
like the outer corner of my eyes to get
the nights like flared lashes for the
lips they already have a lot of
foundation on from earlier so um she had
a like nice soft pink color on so I'm
gonna type um Nick says strawberry milk
so that completes this Ke$ha blow slash
modern Kent eyes with glitter on it
