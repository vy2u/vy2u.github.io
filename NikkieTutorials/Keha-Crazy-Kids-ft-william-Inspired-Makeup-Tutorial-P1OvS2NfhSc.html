like that hey guys um I'm sorry I'm
really trying here so today I'm here to
do a tutorial on Kesha's new music video
crazy kids featuring will.i.am
and I am doing the purple look if you
couldn't tell already I tried to do some
sort of inspiration because then
Instagram she posted pictures where it
was more but pinky look and then in the
music video was more purple and then I
saw backstage photos or it was like
blown out and bright purple so I kind of
took my own spin on it
plus the creepy Illuminati I I can't
wait for all the comments on Illuminati
Illuminati Illuminati I'm not with the
Illuminati I just I really like drawing
eyes on my hand as well so without any
further ado if you want to know how to
get this crazy kids cashie inspired
purple look keep on watching now as
always of course the first thing I want
to do it's a pie based your eyelid
superfan Thiessen's from creasing and
I'm using my mum I always up at
that part
I'm taking my neck soft ochre Paint Pot
Harriet that suck okay so I'm gonna
start by defining my outer lower lash
line and fur that I will be taking sugar
pills
poison plum and Dolly pop I'm just
applying the two to my outer corner of
my lower lash line now they'll be taking
poison plum again and mix it with Mac's
a sketch I shadow that just get e-cash
up and I will be applying this to my
crease in a really nice round shape so
don't make an outer V here just sort of
start following your natural curves your
natural eye curves baby work them curves
honey don't be afraid to go all the way
in
okay darling taking poison plum only
connect the lower part to the curries in
a round way again now I will be taking
this Inglot color the pink one right
there I don't know the number I will put
that on my blog because toriel's calm
I'm gonna mix it with a little bit of
Mac's feather pink right there so that
will make a lovely sort of mid pink
color take a blending brush and just
start blending the edges of this entire
purple crease and of course keep it
round booked them curves taking my lio
le skin fix powder in number 21 blooming
ivory I will use this to Matan down my
brow bone and with this I'm also gonna
blend the edges of the purple and pink a
little bit more plus you have so much
control of this shape with this I always
kind of control the shape with my
highlighting powder taking poison plum
and vibrant grape by Mac just ever so
softly start blending the purple crease
it's all about the blending with this
look because it sort of looks like a
purple cloud around the eye with some
glitter on the lid so just start
blending that in going back with my pink
and going further up taking feather pink
by Mac going even further up and don't
be afraid to especially with this part
right here sort of like the inner half
of your iris sort of make that part
touch your brown brown sort of make that
part touch your brow bone and your brows
a bit because that is what Kesha had it
was a very nice new shape of eyeshadow
okay for the bottom I'm just taking
vibrant grape and fed their pink and
just blend that in towards the inner
corners and then with that Inglot color
kind of blended down here as well
that pink Inglot color to make it
a little bit more saggy on the outer
part saggy in a good way nothing like a
ball sack on my inner corner highlight I
will be taking a blog type by Mac this
look is perfect for people with green
eyes because it will really really bring
the green to the front firmer eyelid I
will be taking this makeup studio color
pigment in EM assist and just put that
all over the lid all the way to the
inner part as well and of course this
video would it be about Ke$ha if it
didn't include some glitter so this is
what I'm gonna do right now I'm gonna
take my Mac reflex in Perl and mix that
with my lid clearly liquid glitter base
mix the two together and then put a
little bit on top of my lid for some
sparkles to open up my eyes I'm gonna
take my Ben Nye neutralizer cream crayon
in red concealer number one okay now I'm
just gonna curl my lashes and apply some
mascara and the mascara that I will be
using is my waterproof 3d extra black my
makeup studio and my benefit their
wheels okay so for the cheeks I prior
contoured and did a bit of work before
filming prior to filming so what I did
is I contoured my face with my NYX blush
in taupe as always I warmed up my face a
little bit more with my illamasqua blush
in disobey as always there for blush she
actually was rocking quite a bit of like
blush I can now see that after
completing the eyes I need a little bit
more blush so the blush I used is by Mac
called love cloud and a little bit of
orgasm by NARTH because why not throw an
orgasm in there and just add a little
bit more because I'm quite not blushy
and just really in an old-fashioned
going back for its way and from a
highlighter I used my NARS albatross
highlighting powder so that's it for the
same
for lips I'm just gonna start off with
my trusty old Mac lip erase impale and
then on top I'm gonna apply a little bit
of Mac's
Viva Glam Gaga lipstick number one and
just sorta dab it on like this and then
on top I'm gonna apply a little bit of
lip radians by Melanie Mills so this is
a lip gleam in pop my cork which is a
stunning color why haven't I used this
before in my life okay now it's time to
