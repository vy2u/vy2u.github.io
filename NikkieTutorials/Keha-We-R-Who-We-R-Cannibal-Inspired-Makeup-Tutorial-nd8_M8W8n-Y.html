crazy look if you follow me on Twitter
and you've seen my take it off tutorial
I love Ke$ha I love his style song
drunkness I don't care what she does I
love her
I saw the cover of cannibal on YouTube
with cannibal the song and then you have
a picture it looked really dirty and
really like ah did that loved it someone
I decided is to do a Ke$ha all-around
cannibal slash we are we are inspired
tutorial so we have the dirty skin the
dirty eyes that the warrior eyes from
her cover and then the eyebrows from we
are who we are I have to be really
honest I think this is one of my most
favorite looks like I've ever done
because it has everything I like it as
that I rest of weirdness a nude lip love
it
- I love you you don't know me but I
love you and if you want to know how I
said this then please stay tuned I'm
gonna do is I'm going to contour the
crap out of my cheekbones and I'm doing
this because on her like the cannibal
cover she looks really dirty a really
like really shaped today's wonder in
this video will be this palette and let
me tell you this is the best palette I
ever had for neutral shades this is my
visa
she's art I know so weird it's called
Buzard
in number L one I will put all the
information on my website link is below
but this one I got in Amsterdam in a
store called backstage and backstage has
been nigh Kryolan makeup studio fees are
pro these are love that shop they have
wigs and like everything it's like a
typical American you have everything
cosmetics store but this time it's in M
so this problem was around 40 euros so
that's where I got even though okay so
the first step I'm going to use isn't
going to grab this neck bronzer and
refined golden and then it's our base
for the conjurer and I'm gonna grab my
Sigma small contour brush best contra
brush in the freaking world so I'm gonna
grab that color and this is going to be
our base for the contour so I'm just
we're gonna feel where your contour is
when you feel this you have bone that's
your cheek bone where you go below oh
I'm going all the way into my right in
my mouth that is your shape you follow
that line to your ears that is your
cheekbone that's it and to make it nice
and pretty on pictures and it realize
you want to make a line from here and
then go up to make it a pyramid if you
like that that's the line and then to
make it nice go up you see and then you
have that shape you know you see that so
now I have my base on for to contour I'm
now going to grab this color it here the
warm one and the dark brown and I'm
gonna keep mixing those two together and
keep applying that to the face to make
it a stronger as you can see it's nice
really strong blend it up never blend
your contour your shape down because you
will get a face like that and you want a
face like that
okay now I'm going to take a duplicate
of that Sigma brush this is by makeup
studio my mom sells this in a webstore
workshop not on one shine on my
cheekbone to make it shiny and dirty and
ketchup so I'm gonna grab my baby this
is my baby eye shadow this is ivory gold
Lemire I should have a big studio with a
sigma large shader
right here like right here
but on top of the cheekbone like above
it and then connected and blended and
it's sign for the eyebrows
I'm gonna grab Mac's mystery eyeshadow
I'm gonna make my brows darker than they
really are so I'm going to grab mystery
eyeshadow by Mac with a slanted brush I
always start with the tails of my brows
and now it's just a matter of fiddling
everything up I'm gonna grab that
spoolie brush again and brush it a
little bit to soften it the front okay
so I'm just gonna brush the hairs up
with the brow gel for a nice rough
feeling and now what I like is the
finishing touch I'm going to grab my Mac
concealer and a concealer brush and just
make that lower line under the eyebrows
a little bit sharp so I already applied
a base to my eyelids I used my Michael
Todd new cream eyeshadow to and keep all
the shadows in place so the first thing
I'm going to do is allocate where your
crease needs to be so that harsh line
I'm gonna grab a 252 by Mac and I'm
gonna grip that these are pallet I'm
gonna grab that color that color so we
use these two for our contour I'm gonna
use the one next to it for my crease I'm
gonna get the tip of the bristles and
coat it with the shadow what you want to
do is you want to look right in front of
you in the mirror lift it just just a
little teeny bit push the brush in look
for and really push it in push it and
wiggle in that crease so keep pushing
look that's your crease
the same and go further in so keep
pushing it push her push go in go in and
push and push go in and push crease as
I'm gonna grab the same color with the
same brush and I'm gonna blend this into
my nose line and if you follow the nose
line it you can see this bone right here
follow that follow that followed up all
that I want to cover that I'm gonna go
into my brow I'm gonna go into it now I
want to deepen it because now it looks a
little flat I'm gonna grab the dark
brown color and the black to darken up
the crease just darken it up and
especially again on the inner corners
darken it
I want to grab a 2:39 and I'm going to
go into the white color and the color
next to it and this will be my brow bone
highlight now because I've left some
shimmer on my brow bone I'm gonna grab
my baby again ivory gold and put that on
the top now with those same colors I'm
going on to my lips first pack it on
really heavily then brush that brush on
the paper towel and soften the color up
I'm going to grab a angled brush I'm
going to go into the dark brown color
and I'm going to start off with like the
thing right here that makes your eyes
look bigger
now follow your lashline
once you follow your lashline
you're gonna follow the direction of
your waterline and just wing it out so
wing it out now I'm going to grab black
and make it more intense and make it
thicker as well I'm going to grip a
pencil brush and I'm going to warm color
next to the dark brown and smoke it down
now I'm going to grab a really small
angled brush and the girl we is at
lightest color of the pellet and
highlight it in two parts so now I want
to make this nice and connect it like I
did here so I'm just going to grab that
warm color again and connect it to the
line okay what I'm gonna do now is I'm
going to grab a nude eye pencil this is
by makeup studio and this is their
concealer pencil I'm gonna line my
waterline apply a little line of black
track to the upper lash line some
mascara which is makeup studio maximum
volume of course curl the lashes and
then I will show you how to get the
brows hey so what I also did and I
didn't tape it I'm sorry
because Ke$ha loves her glitter
I took some MEK gold glitter and applied
it to my lower lash line my mom came
home with the most brilliant idea ever
said little more sheer shade Shasha
these are chocolate candies with with
nuts in it you rip it open you had some
most delicious thing ever
then your exes gold foil which they pack
it in you stretch it flat oh my broken
up you stretch it plat you fold a little
stroke in it you cut that off you have a
stroke then you cut those off and then
you have little mini fake studs
mum you're brilliant I mean hello you're
brilliant I'm gonna use five of my
brother's you can choose the side the
side so you can decide on your own how
big you want them to be honest Molly I
want them to be how much how many you
want to apply so I'm going to get my GOI
glue and I'm just gonna glue them above
my brow
so I'm going to let that dry a little
bit better so the glue will be clear for
lips cashout loves new lips just like I
do she even wears white no and then not
really what I like but I loves annuities
so I'm gonna get my pale lip arrays from
egg and pill them out man
am I doing that all the attention goes
to this crazy right here I'm gonna get
some crabs a nude lipstick by Mac and
