tutorial on Kelly Osbourne's stickers
her bright neon pink lip look she was on
America's Next Top Model couple of weeks
ago and and i loved-ed oh my god I feel
like when talking about Kelly Osbourne I
have to have a British accent so here we
go it was like so amazing she is
gorgeous probably the worst British
accent on this entire planet so today
I'm going to show you how to get this
really nice winged glittery eye with
neon pink lips and so yeah if you want
to know how to get this then please keep
on watching
so as in every video you want to start
off with a primer or a base to make your
eyes on a lesser at the entire day and
the one I'm using is soft ochre Paint
Pot for Mac okay now I'm gonna take this
NYX jumbo pencil in milk um it's not
really a jumbo pencil anymore this is
going onto the lid and then blend it out
now I'm going to take the Naked 2
palette and I'm gonna take the color
chopper and I'm gonna mix it with Mac's
all that glitters and I'm gonna apply
that to like the inner part of my lid
and because of the jumbo eye pencil the
glitter in chopper really shows up and I
love that because then chopper is like
this medical beautiful eye shadow now
I'm going to take mix cork eyeshadow and
kid eyes shadow and first I'm making the
direction of the shape of the entire eye
look that I want it to be and I want it
to be kind of like an outer V so I'm
just gonna make a stripe and then from
the point go into the crease until you
meet up with chopper and all that
glitters and a blend it in now fill this
gap up with cork only and blend it into
the chopper and all that glitters now
I'm gonna take it only and kind of blend
this out and make that outer V softer
we're just blending it up into a nice
wing don't make it too windy because
then it will look like an 80s poor look
and you don't want that I'm gonna take a
bigger blending brush and make it even
softer and then just go back with some
quark and darken that outer V again
because of the blending sometimes the
colors get a little less dark and you
want it to be a little bit more dark at
the outer V I'm gonna take max mixing
medium in eyeliner and Max reflects
pearl which is awesome it is beautiful
No
I'm gonna text about that mixing medium
eyeliner and padded onto my lid where I
want the reflex to stick to and then
just take a brush and go into those our
reflex pearl and then place them on top
I'm gonna take next PowerSearch i
could´t
and I'm just blending that really close
to my bottom lashes and just the outer
corner really and then blend it up to
meet with quark I'm gonna take max a
sohbat eyeshadow and just place this
over PowerSearch and then blending it
through the middle of the lower lid and
then also do that out of me right there
and then for an inner corner highlight
I'm gonna take max crystal Avalanche and
just highlight your inner corners with
it right here and then also on the
bottom I'm gonna take max power search I
call again and apply that to my
waterline and now for the eyeliner I'm
gonna take max black track fluid line
and just like always make a really nice
winged eyeliner by first making the line
where you want your wing to go to
and then you want to make sure that on
the very inner corners of your eyes you
want the line to be really really thin
because with every close-up I have seen
of Kelly's eye look the line in the in
the like inner corner is really really
small
I'm gonna curl my lashes and apply some
mascara and the mascara I'm using is my
makeup studio waterproof through the XR
black I love this it's the yeah what I
just said and then I'm also gonna apply
some lashes these are the ardell demi
whispies these are amazing that gives
that nice flair to the eye for a nice
cat eye shape
so I'm going to apply those two
so I basically just did half of my lip
and explained what you can use for
Kelly's signature lips and I didn't
press record I'm going to just fill you
in on what I'm doing right now right now
I am using sleeks and lipstick and mix
it with mix 52 to get her signature neon
pink bow jibba jibba idiot
that completes his Kelly Osbourne
inspired makeup tutorial um I love this
I love that the eyes are so glittery and
playful and then the bright neon pink
lips I love Kelly Kelly I love you for
