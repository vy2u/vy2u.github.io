recreation slash inspirate other side
slash today I'm gonna do a recreation
slash inspiration by Kelly Rowland says
new video music video called kisses down
low she is rocking so many awesome looks
throughout this entire video but her
main look is sorta got me falling in
love because it's like a really
glamorous eye but with color so the
inner crease is sort of pink and then
she has purple in the lower lashline and
absolutely stunning and I looked at
today I decided to recreate her main
look throughout the entire music video
which it's this of course I do not look
anything like Helle anything but like I
always did when you love the makeup you
got to put it on your face and you got
to put it on your face so if you want to
know how to get this look then please
keep on watching so as always the first
thing you want to do is apply a base
your eyelets you prevent the eyeshadow
from creasing and I am using my trusty
old Mac soft ochre Paint Pot and kisses
down on the primed eyelids so the first
eyeshadow we'll be using is a mixture
between a poison plum by sugarpill and
embark by Mac and you just want to brush
this onto the outer part of the lower
lash line then from Urban Decay's Glinda
palette I'm gonna take magic eyeshadow
and this is stunning and I'm gonna use
that mixed with poison plum to blend
that outer corner out a little bit more
and make it even more purple for the
crease I'm gonna take my fees art pellet
in number one this is everyone needs to
have this in their lives and I'm gonna
take this color right here and I'm
mixing it a bit with Mac's kid eyes
shadow and what you want to do is just
start building this up in the outer
corners first of like the outer area of
your crease
for the pink inner crease I'm gonna take
dolly pop by sugarpill
and I'm gonna blend and mix that out of
it with magic again this is such a
stunning car you really really want to
start off lightly with Dobby pop because
if you make it too much it will look
like a clown
not like Kelly Rowland but like Michelle
no so just start brushing that into the
crease and build it up and then what I'm
basically doing is sort of building up
the colors in my crease I'm adding more
of the brown I'm adding more of the pink
I'm blending the two together and
basically gonna add colors to my crease
until I like what I see
I can't really explain it it's just
adding colors blending it out and then
looking at yourself and be like okay
what else do I need now so right now
adding more if the pink and after this
I'm gonna add more of the brown and just
make it all a seamless nice sort of
blend and haze around the eyes now I'm
gonna take a matte black eyeshadow and
this is Carvin by Mac but you can take
any matte black color that you have and
with this start making a eyeliner just
like you normally would but just a
little bit more winged and cat eyed and
what we're gonna do with this later on
is blend it out and make it look sexy
and soft and that will give it that
really sort of seductive sort of feeling
okay so to blend it I'm gonna take
embark again and mix it with a little
bit of carbon and then just start
wiggling the outer corners of the winged
liner and what you keep doing that it
kinda turns out into this blended PISA
god I can't start wiggling and smudging
it all out
I'm now gonna take my Mac pressed
pigment in day gleam and just apply this
to the lid area and this is gorgeous
I'm gonna use illusion by the Urban
Decay toss palette again this is Glinda
and basically just at this color to the
middle to really make it look as if your
eyelid has that amazing sort of wet
highlight okay back to the lower lid I'm
sort of gonna drag that purple color out
to the black to make it somewhat of a
nicer shape overall for the inner
corners of my lower lash I'm gonna make
a mixture between kid and embark and
kind of mix the two together and then
drag that to the inner corners of the
eyes and then for an inner corner
highlight I'm going to take another Oz
palette by urban decay Glinda color this
is aura and I'm gonna take the pink side
and this is a really nice duochrome
color okay now I'm just gonna line my
waterline with my NYX jet black slide on
pencil apply some mascara this is my
waterproof 3d extra black mascara by
makeup studio and of course some lashes
and the lashes that we'll be using are
the ones I used in my Rihanna Grammys
video as well be they are not sticking
but these are the Katy Perry oh honey
lashes okay so now it's time for the
cheeks and I'm actually gonna contour
first I'm actually not gonna call her
first because I already did that
but I can't tell you what to use for it
I guess you already know what to use for
it um I used my NYX blush in taupe sort
of like the base and then to give myself
warmth and to blend it out I used my
Illamasqua blush in disobey so that is
what I used to contour and I also get my
nose Kelly likes you have her nose
contoured quite a bit as well so I was
like why not joining the party for a
pleasure making a mixture between my
NARS
Gina and Norris luster and gonna mix the
two together and then pop that on my
cheekbones and then to give myself that
million dollar bucks glow I'm gonna use
NARS albatross highlighter and I can't
stop loving this it's absolutely
gorgeous I'm using it on everybody that
I know I am using it on myself I'm using
it I want to married that stuff okay so
for my lips I'm first gonna line and
contour and kind of contour my lips I'm
gonna contour my lips a little bit with
world lip pencil by Mac then I'm gonna
take my lip erase my Mac and completely
blank them out but keep that sort of
contoured line for a plump effect and
firmly plus going to use my NARS Turkish
delight and that everybody completes my
