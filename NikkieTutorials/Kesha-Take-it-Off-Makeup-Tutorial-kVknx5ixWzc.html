tutorial by Kesha with take it off of
course you will never get the paint
splashes because I feel like I shot them
in the video so I just did this so
inspired we should not we both so if you
want to know how to become Ke$ha for
Halloween or I know a passion party or a
Kesha concert
the thing is for watching for a product
a breath and for a product list of
everything I used go to my website nigga
tutorials calm uh-huh okay I'm gonna
stop blabbing out thank you bye
so everything you want to do is apply
and prevents them from creasing so I
already did that and I already did the
first step of the eye shadow as well
because I forgot I was I was doing this
I so what I did was I took max vanilla
eyeshadow and apply that to the middle
of my lid only so just the middle now
I'm going to take max wedge eyes shadow
and I'm just going to take a 239 and
apply this to the inner corners of the
eyes and the outer then we're going to
take a 226 by Sigma and back into wedge
and the plug is into the crease and what
I like to do as well is go up a little
here and then go into the crease again I
want to bring in a little bit more of
depth into the eyes so I'm going to take
corduroy a slightly darker color and
apply this to the inner in the outer
corner as well and then I like to take a
270 my Mac and go into corduroy and
blended now go ahead and take the
vanilla and apply it to the brow bone to
the inner corners right here and reapply
some onto the middle of the lid I'm
going to apply corduroy all the way from
here to here now I'm just going to apply
some winged eyeliner and blur check for
the line to my waterline and then it's
time to go crazy and do this okay so now
it's time for the fun fun fun fun part
Kesha knocked me over with the color I
was like well at school your your take
a hotel with your group and stuff so of
course I'm never going to get the pain
splashes on exactly like ash had them on
this impossible so I just get something
inspired so we're going to do it now to
the other side I'm gonna take two main
lawn pellets I got these from silly
foreign calm here we go this one is the
pastel and this one is the tropical and
from the tropical we're going to use a
yellow and from the pastel we're going
to use this pink that blue that blue
that purple and that's it for glitters
we're going to use pearl lilac by makeup
studio and a fuchsia eye makeup studio
and gold by Mac but first let's do the
paint I'm going to wet the may run with
a fixed bus because you have to use some
wet to make them use a bowl because else
nothing will come off then I like to
take these sponges and just stipple
purple it on so I'm going to start on
the pink just do something I mean it's
inspired so it doesn't have to be like
pup Huayra go up up
so um that is how I'm gonna stick okay
now it's time for glitter I'm going to
take makeup studio um pearl lilac I'm
just gonna put this wherever I like to
put it I definitely like to use that
pearl I like more on the color tones of
paint duders glitter all over my desk
there for lips um I'm just gonna take
max of Eva Glen Gaga thank ya
so think again so much for watching I
hope you like this I hope you just get
some of that may run stuff and just get
some sponges and just knock it on your
face and I don't know if you want to
catch her for Halloween or something so
I think you guys so much for watching
the glitter is probably all up in my
bangs right now but I don't care um and
I will see you guys next time
