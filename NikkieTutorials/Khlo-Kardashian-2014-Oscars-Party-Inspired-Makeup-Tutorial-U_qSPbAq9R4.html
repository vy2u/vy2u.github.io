last week and I didn't find too many
amazing makeup looks except for Lupita
Nyong'o I mean whatever she puts on her
face is amazing but then I found a
picture of Khloe Kardashian at the Elton
John Oscars eighth's foundation party
Khloe looked amazing the dress the hair
the lipstick the the lashes the
everything the curves the body amazing
so yes you want to know how to get this
Khloe Kardashian at the Elton John AIDS
Foundation party makeup look the police
keep watching so to start this look off
the first thing I did was apply base to
my eyelids to prevent the I shoulda from
creasing and for that I use my Mac soft
ochre Paint Pot and for the eyes this is
gonna be the most easy tutorial ever the
panel that we'll be using today is by
Bobbi Brown and this is coffee party all
night I palettes and from the palette
I'll be taking this medium brown color
you're gonna really likely apply this to
the crease to just add a little bit of
shaping and contouring I'm barely
touching my skin I just want this to
slightly build in some definition and
then with another blending brush i'm
just gonna define the edges a little bit
more by giving it another blend now for
the color what you want to remember is
that you want it to look like a wash of
color so it isn't really pigmented or
solid it's just a wash of a coppery
shimmery goodness i shadow if weird that
I'll be taking this Kiko color fair I
shadow in number 4 and it will also take
from the Bobbi Brown pellit and what
also makes it this color in a bit
because it has the most amazing glittery
shimmer particles in it and a little
trick to keep it really soft and light
and sort of wash like it's to apply with
a blending brush the softer the blending
brush the softer the color goes on and
then also flick it into the crease a
little bit now I'm gonna take next
Teddy eye pencil and you want to play
this really closely to the roots of the
lower lash line and go about half way in
like that and as you
brush and smudge that in and then going
back in that Bobby Brown mid brown color
with that I'm just gonna give it a
little bit more warmth and color and
blend it even lower down so this will
really give the look a nice smoky and
edgy feeling and then wipe that pencil
brush off and then just start defining
the edges a little bit more but just
blending them for my inner corner
highlight it will be taking the bomb
over shadow pigment in no money no honey
and just really glow up the inner
corners with this what you now want to
do is apply mascara to your top and
bottom lashes and for this I'll be using
my makeup Cydia waterproof 3d extra
black and I don't know if you could tell
but lashes are a necessity for this look
because I mean look at it and fur lashes
I will be using my Miss adoro number 43
s and they're really long and flirty and
hairy and that's exactly what you want
for this look so I'll be applying that
right now okay so for cheeks you want to
go sculpted bronzy a little bit of color
and lots and lots of shine so what it
first did is off camera is I contour my
face using my Illamasqua album what is
it I shadow I shadow in heroine
god damn that went well then to give her
complexion that warmth I'm gonna use my
Illamasqua blush in disobey and just
buff that contour out with it and just
give yourself some warmth that's it
for blush I'm gonna pop a little bit of
color on and for that I will be using my
Mac blush ombre in vintage grape and
I'll be taking this magenta pinky color
and just lightly the apples of the
cheeks and then blending backwards and
now it's time for the glow this is a
necessity for any Kardashian look and
especially for Chloe as well because she
loves her glow and for this I'll be
using my Mac whisper of guilt extra
dimension skin finish and in places
where I feel like I need even more I'm
going in with my overshadow pigment by
the balm called no money no honey and
where I'm highlighting is right here on
the tops of the
bones and then blending a little bit
onto the apples of the cheeks okay then
also on the top of your nose your
Cupid's bow a little bit like a little -
huh on your chin and then Chalker a
little tiny tiny bit right here above
your brows sort of at the inner third of
your brows and and up till your forehead
and that just gives you an amazing glow
and then with my overshadow payment from
the balm you're just gonna highlight the
tip of my nose and now for the eye
catcher of this look the lipstick Chloe
were a really deep vampy red color and
for that Oh be using Mac's
media
and you guys said safe that completes my
Khloe Kardashian at the Elton John AIDS
Foundation party the the after Oscars
