Kardashian inspired makeup tutorial from
the cosmopolitan cover a lot of you guys
have asked me to do a tutorial on this
look and I absolutely love Khloe she's
my favorite Kardashian and I love the
look she was wearing it's super lashy
it's all about the lashes and the nude
lips and just Chloe looks goddamn
amazing lately
see ya today I decided to recreate her
look and if you want to know how to look
like this now please stay tuned okay
guys so the first thing I'll be doing is
taking my Mac prep and prime natural
radiance in radiant yellow and with this
I'll be prepping my face for all the
foundation that we're going to put on
top I'm going to use a sort of a medium
to full coverage foundation because
we're doing a Kardashian look so I want
to moisturize and prime really well so
that the foundation looks really nice
over top
okay this wick has got to go for a
second because it's driving me nuts all
right let's do makeup is anyone else
like that when doing your makeup I
always want my hair to be out of the way
and not even near my face when I do my
makeup so uh okay um you're going to
have to bear with this for a while as I
said the Kardashians love their full
coverage makeup so I go for the studio
fix a fluid foundation by Mac and nc15
today this is actually my first time
trying it so I'm first just going to dab
this on my skin and with my Sigma f80 a
time buffing this in oh that's pretty
for concealer I'm of course using my pro
longwear by Mac and NP 15 and this is
going of course underneath my eyes
bridge of my nose and then with my Real
Techniques sponge I'm going to buff this
all in
and I'll explain why I'm back to using a
sponge instead of my Sigma f80 6 in a
later video it's for a great reason but
just hang on to that I will tell you
later on in a different video then of
picking up a little bit of my Laura
Mercier secret brightening powder and
I'm setting my under eye area with that
then I'm going to do brows and one eye
off-camera and then it will be back so
as always the first thing I'm going to
do for my look is a PI base and I'm
using my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot for
this and I like to lay that down with a
brush first and blend in with a finger
okay now going into the tartlets eyes
shadow palette by Tarte and I'm mixing
two colleagues together for my crease
color and that our first of nature and
wanderer and I'm just going to begin by
placing this on the outer part of my
eyes it's a lid and crease just on the
outer portion and I like to take some
more and start building up that outer
portion right here and then what I like
to do is start swooping it into the
crease further in but not too far
because we're going to keep it till like
halfway of the eyes also going to go
ahead and blend this color out more up
towards my brows and also point it out a
little bit more then from that same
tartlet palette a mixing wonderer with
dreamer and dem applying this really
close to the roots of my lashes with a
fluffy brush and we're basically
mimicking step one where we dust the
shadow of the outer portion of our eyes
slowly but surely work your way up with
that and just keep blending it keep it
really soft and diffused then with a
clean brush I'm going to blend away any
harsh edges for the lid I'll be using a
pigment by the balm and this is called
no money no honey and this is going on
to the inner portion
of the eye meeting with the Browns we
just applied and then kind of whisk it
in to the ground I'm also applying this
to my inner corners because Chloe was
glammed and glowy so for the lower lash
line I'm again taking that tartlet
eyeshadow palette by Tarte and I'm
taking the colors dreamer and power
player and I'm starting off as very thin
on the lower lashes now depending on
your eyes you can go as thick or as thin
with this as you like I personally love
it when my under eye area is a little
bit more low down and smoked out because
it makes my eyes appear bigger now if
you feel like that doesn't suit your
eyes then keep it tight and keep it
small with a bigger fluffy blending
brush I'm taking wonderer and smoking it
down now I'm going to take the Ben Nye
neutralizer cream crayon in ultra light
and I'm running this on my waterline and
then now for the key feature of this
entire look where the lashes so I'm
going to use the Ardell 113 for my top
lashes and besides a whole lot of
mascara on the bottom lashes I'm also
going to apply falsies these are by
house of lashes and these are called
precious so I'm going to put the lashes
on off-camera but I do have a full
tutorial on it so I will link that down
below and I'll be right back okay so far
it takes today I'm gonna go for that
classic Kardashian contour felt with the
K contour with the K so the first thing
I'm going to do is contour of course
using my Illamasqua let me open it up
illamasqua eyeshadow in heroin and just
place it right underneath your
cheekbones and start blending and
diffusing it out and then to make a look
a little bit more natural I'm going to
swoop this in towards my nose and that
will make this portion here look less
fake because it's so light there so kind
of swoop it into your nose and then also
to make my lips look more prominent
I'm going to take that same powder and a
stigma pointed crease brush I'm going to
go right underneath my bottom lip like
and if you apply a contour shape there
it makes the illusion as if your bottom
lip is bigger and it creates that shadow
because it's so big okay then for
bronzer and it take refine to golden by
Mac and I'm just going to take a bigger
fluffy brush and then warm up my face
even more so just with the tips of the
brush
I'm very lightly go to warm up my
complexion and I just buff it out from
the contour going up into the cheeks and
a temples if for blush I'm going to go
in Milan ease Luminoso I've been loving
this one and this is going right on the
apples of the cheeks blending back into
the contour and the bronze parts there
for highlight you want to go super glowy
because Chloe looked super glowy because
I'm going to use for this is the Becca
shimmering skin Perfector in moonstone
and I'm first going to highlight the tip
of my nose and then also the bridge like
the little swoop of my nose Cupid's bow
very important and then of course the
highest points of my cheekbones and then
now for a typical Kardashian trick is to
grab some loose powder and I guess we've
all seen the pictures of Kim or Chloe
where they had like a really light
powder underneath their contour
underneath their eyes on their nose
forehead basically everywhere and it's a
really thick layer of powder gunked-up
on the skin and that is what drag queens
call cooking or baking the powder and
what that will do is once you put that
powder on it will actually highlight and
clean up the part where you apply too so
let's say if you want
contoured to be a little bit more
prominent and you want this aligned to
be a little bit more clean what you can
do is this is the trick you would go
with the trick you take light powder
this is my makeup studio this is number
one and you take as much powder as you
can and you line it up against the
contour line and that will clean up and
highlight it in a way so whenever you
see a picture of a celebrity or me or
whoever with a very light powder
underneath their contour and it's very
thick it's that they are cooking or
baking they're highlighting powders
letting it set and that will clean up
their contour lines and their skin so
I'm going to jump over to lips right now
letting this set and afterwards I will
brush it all off so until it's the first
I'm going to do is align them to give
them more volume I'm using a mixture of
the maca lip pencil and strip down but
I'm also taking a little bit of the LA
girl endless a semi-permanent auto lip
liner in natural so these two are going
to be the products that will make my
lips appear larger then the looks like
I'll be using is a flash pot by Mac and
now going in with nude by la girl to get
the lips more depth okay what I'm going
to do now is take a brush and wipe away
the powder that we used for the cooking
method in one direction so well well
okay two directions I don't care and as
you can see that drastically cleaned up
the line underneath my contour it made
it super precise is super clear but
still beautiful and almost photoshopped
really
