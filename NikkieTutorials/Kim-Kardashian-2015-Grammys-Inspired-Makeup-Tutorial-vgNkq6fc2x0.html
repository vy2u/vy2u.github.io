hey guys thank you so much for watching
so today I'm doing my last Grammys
inspired makeup tutorial this one today
is inspired by Kim Kardashian
so her makeup artist Mario instagrammed
what products he used for the eyes so
today I decided to recreate that look
right here right now so without any
further ado if you want to know how to
get this Kim Kardashian Grammys inspired
makeup look then please stay tuned okay
guys so the first thing I'll be doing is
applying a base to my eyelids to prevent
everything from creasing and as always
I'm using my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot
and I literally have like one or two
uses left which I'm my pants
cuz I have like a big event tomorrow and
I need my soft ochre and we focused on
my eye
the first eyeshadow I'll be using is by
unaccessible hilts and this is stone and
live a Miss stone is going to be my
transition shade so this is going right
in that crease and blending up and out
once you reach that outer corner here
just kind of flick your brush to the
side like this okay and then with a
bigger fluffy blending brush I'm going
to drag that onto the inner corner and
kind of round it out right here
then on the outer third of my living'
them take on a size of every hills in
emerald so I'm just applying this
straight to the outer third and then
with another clean blending brush I'm
going to diffuse the edges into that
outer V that we just created right here
blend it in to the mix make it one our
next color is going to be on associate
Beverly Hills Moss and I'm applying this
color straight on to the lid to the
middle so from emerald it goes into Moss
you just want to apply it there all the
way up to the crease kind of go towards
those inner corners also not all the way
kind of leave some space open then I'm
taking the NYX jumbo eye pencil in
Cottage I mean nikkietutorials
and this is going straight onto that
inner tear duct area
and then with uh necessity Beverly Hills
soft gold I'm going over top and this is
also a shadow used by her makeup artist
and so I'm taking a pencil brush and
going over top of that jumbo pencil by
NYX to really get that highlight going
because I feel like Kim's look was all
about the highlight and the glow and the
illumination and then also you want to
apply it onto that inner third of the
lid blending into that Moss color for
the lower lash line you want to take a
Moss again and that is going from outer
to inner corner and then I'm applying a
little bit of emerald on the outer
corners to darken it and soft gold on
the inner corners
natural Grantha look I'm going to use an
eyeliner and today I'm using cavities
tattoo liner in trooper just to get my
outline and you want to start out by
creating a line aiming towards the end
of your eyebrows and then from there
drag it back on to the lid and then what
I like to do now is drag it all the way
to the inner corners then also to
elongate the eyes you want to extend the
inner corner just a tiny bit and then
out filling everything in with my NYC
black liquid liner alright all you want
to do now to complete the ice is apply
some coal to the waterline I'm using
Mac's power surge I'm going to do this
off camera because zooming this on
camera is a living hell and then now all
you have to do is apply a little bit of
mascara to top and bottom lashes and
some falsies of course we're talking Kim
Kardashian here and I'm using the house
of lashes temptress wispy
four cheeks it wouldn't be a Kardashian
video if you're gonna go all the way
with contouring and blush and glow and
all the magic is on the face so first
I'm going to contour my face using my
Illamasqua eyeshadow in heroine and I'm
going to use a mixture of two brushes
I'm going to use the zoeva 109 because a
lot of people told me that I should try
this after hating the NARS one and then
also my trusty old Mac 163 just because
it works for me
now this I do like hallelujah you can
make like super sharp stripes with it
and then blend up this is like a
hardcore contour brush if you're feeling
like getting them cheekbones carved out
like no other this is your brush now
this is what the NARS eita brush was
supposed to do for me then to further
bronze up my face I'm going to use the
Mac refined golden bronzing powder and
with my makeup studio sa1 brush then for
blush Mario on his Instagram told
everyone that the blush used on Kim was
NARS orgasm so why not use that one and
lastly for highlighter I'm going to use
the bum mary lou manizer
and that's it for cheeks kim's lips were
super nude and glossy so first going to
give myself a little bit more volume and
plump using the design pro lip pencil in
Mehran more on the free lipstick I'm
going to use Mac's
flash pot and then as a gloss Mac's
oyster girl
and that guy's concludes this Kim
