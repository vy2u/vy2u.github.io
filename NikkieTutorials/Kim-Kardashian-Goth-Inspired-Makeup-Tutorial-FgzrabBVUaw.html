on Kim Kardashian's a goth photoshoot
Kim Kardashian did this photo shoot with
up almost black lips no brows just I'm
sure on the eyes and just liner I
absolutely loved it but I never really
got around on doing a tutorial on it so
I made a face chart on top on top of it
címon a face shard recreating the look
so today taystee oh I'm itching I kind
of look like the Joker why so serious
anyways today I decided to do a tutorial
on that look and yeah so if you want to
know how to get this really different
look then please keep on watching the
first thing you want to do is apply a
starless to prevent the eyeshadow from
creasing and when I'm using is the neck
soft ochre Paint Pot so the first color
that we're going to use is Max twinks
and Electra and I'm going to mix those
two together to get this like really
silverish like taupey brown color I'm
just going to Pat that on to the lid
then i'm going to take mix copperplate
and with a blending brush i'm just going
to blend that into my crease and i'm
going to go somewhat more close to my
nose with the shadow just to give that
like oven guard
like shadow to the eye then with the
even bigger blending brush you're just
going to make it all soft and just go
higher up and blend that in a corner
right here and again to give that up on
guard feeling like autre to a baby that
was crystal avalanche I'm going to
highlight my brow bone just a little bit
I'm going to apply some of the twinks
and the Electra to the bottom lashline
as well and I'm going about to like that
part of my iris and I'm going to take a
mixing medium you can take more from Mac
but I am going to use this la splash
liquid eyeliner thingy and I'm just
going to put some on to the inner corner
of my lower lid and then I'm going to
take makeup studios jewel effects in
shine this is the prettiest highlight
silvery glittery color ever so I'm going
to apply that to the inner corner and
yeah and then with the brush that you
applied the twing send it electro with
just kind of blended now it's time for
the hardest part of the entire real look
which is the eyeliner what you want to
do is make a small line on your lid and
you can wing it out of it if you like I
did just a little teeny tiny wing but
you want to take the entire eyeliner to
the inner corner right here to give it
almost that Arabian like that arabica
feeling just like the dark eyeliner all
the way to the inner corners um for that
I'm going to use mac's blacktrack which
is just a black eyeliner cream gel
eyeliner and I'm just going to start off
with a simple line on my lid
and then I'm going to go in really
thinly into the entire inner corner you
want to start thin because once you have
like a big blob of black there you're
never going to have like that smooth
line so just start really thin
I want to do now is put your eyes your
head like this and just draw like a
point into it and then go back in and
once you have that of course fill it in
you will notice that on top right now
the line isn't smooth anymore so go
ahead and smooth that out
what I'm gonna do now is curl my lashes
with my dip honest eyelash curler and
apply some mascara to the top lashes
only and once I've done that I will be
back for the dark burgundy lips for the
lips
Kim's lips were really mad and almost
black she had a hint of burgundy in it
and I absolutely love how she's like
she's always wearing the noot lid and
then BAM and this should add dark dark
burgundy I love it so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to take my lip brush
this is the Mac 231 and this is lip mix
in Burgundy and lip mix in black now the
burgundy one is absolutely amazing but
it isn't quite as opaque as it is in the
pot so this comes out a little bit
lighter than it is right here so to make
a darker I'm going to take the black
which is really opaque so you only need
a little bit of that and I'm just going
to make the perfect dark burgundy color
that she was wearing and I'm just going
to apply it to the lips and keep in mind
you want to keep it mad because that is
what Kim had but if you don't like my
just ed gloss so this is the color it's
going to be on my lips and just take
your lip brush and apply it
I know that this is a little bit talking
but that completes this a Kim Kardashian
inspired goth look um I absolutely love
that she did this for one like the dark
lips and uh loved it she didn't have any
brows but if I would do that with my
blonde hair I would just look
interesting everyone a fullness of every
