a Kim Kardashian going out clubbing
inspired look when I think of Kim
Kardashian I think of smokiness hotness
bright smoking eyes with new lips which
I love I love I think of long hair I
think of I don't know what I think of
this um but I didn't really want to do
the typical Kim Kardashian smoky eye
with the brown and the black and the
light brown because that is what most of
the youtubers on youtube do so what I
wanted to do is give it a little spin
for going out so when I go out I almost
always wear glitter on so I did that
today again I hope you guys like it if
you want to know how I did this then
please keep on watching and enjoy the
video
Hey
Beibei but again
so the first thing you want to do is
apply a base to your list to prepare
your eyes from creasing because if you
want to look like Kim Kardashian then
you want to go out and you want to look
smoking hot and pretty you're really
doing the base for your eyes or else it
will crease and that can be pretty but
not with this what I used is this
Michael Todd nude eyeshadow base primer
thingy I got it from August medical calm
I think this is 10 times better than
next paint only Paint Pot I will do a
review on this very soon because I'm
sure of it now this is the best the
first color we're going to work with is
set in taupe by Mac and excuse my ugly
as bare nails I know I should be in them
but did have time give one to yours oh
I'm getting this new Sigma brush in 226
and this is from the new Sigma premium
kit and I am in love with the premium
kit when I got it I died as to backup
and I died again and as a backup I am in
love with the premium kit from Sigma so
I will do a review on that very soon as
well but for now just take the 226 and
some on setting taupe which is that
brown cool taupe color yes and I'm
getting that on the brush and this is
going right into the crease and this
brush is so nice for doing your crease
because um this it just works like
heaven they are going to take max
pigment in push the edge if you're like
woah you use a lot since the last time
you did this well I had an interview
with team F from the nel lens and um I
did this interview and I did this color
on her and then this dropped and then
all hell broke loose and it dropped to
push out pigment and
get that on the same 2:26 and this is
going into the crease as well for a nice
purple touch this will make it easier to
blend the purple glitter out and the
sketch on the lid so this is just for
the nice gradient effect now we're going
to do our highlight already I'm going to
take the knob by Mac my favorite
highlighting color with a 275 my
favorite highlighter brush from Sigma
and I'm getting it onto the brush and
this is going on to the baboon and here
as well just the beat
now I'm going to intensified it set in
taupe and that pushy edge and it creates
a little bit more so what I'm going to
do is take Mac sketch with a 239 by Mac
and I'm going to put this all over the
lid okay the fun part starts right here
right now um this is another way instead
of glue or lipgloss or mascara to make
your make your glitter and he had he's
adhesive and he's stick to the UM eyelid
I took a black waterproof extreme art
eyeliner from gosh this is number seven
the black one and what I did is I took a
little bit on my hand
I took a synthetic brush synthetic brush
I applied that black all over my lid and
what I did that is with the same brush
go in the glitter which is Mac's very
pink glare again from the Hello Kitty
line and put that on top and that is
another way to make your glitter stick
to her eyes and prevent them from
creasing so I'm going to do that right
now I'm going to speed things a little
bit forward without a handle on the
background so I'm enjoy
for the lower lid I'm going to take my X
jumbo pencil in milk and apply that all
over my low elite now I'm gonna take
glamour doll eyes eye pigment in
chocoholic
alright chocoholic right and I'm going
to take another new brush from Sigma one
of my new favorites there's just a tooth
14 to 14 and I'm taking chocoholic which
is an amazing deep shimmering dark brown
an amazing color and I'm applying this
sorry for discovering all over my lower
lid it just applies everywhere
and don't be afraid to smoke it down
because with kim kardashian it so it's
really smoky and smudgy and i love it
i'll take a little bit of sketch with
that same brush and smudge that along
the outer part right here that and now
for the inner corner we're going to do
exactly the same thing that we did on
the upper corner upper part i'm going to
take another bed of the stream art
eyeliner and with another synthetic
brush and this time it's an angled
synthetic brush like this one I'm going
to put it on my inner corner and then
apply the glitter to it and then I will
add some mascara which is a Rimmel
London's the next volume flash another
one of my favorites grandma's really
good mascara really good um I love my
waterline with um bourgeois waterproof
eyeliner in black party party black um
and then I will show you what I did on
my lips so I'll be right back I promise
that I will do a video very soon with
bright lips dark lips I don't know what
on but I will do that soon but for this
look I just really didn't want to do
that so I'm sorry so for the people that
do want to know it is on my lips it is
