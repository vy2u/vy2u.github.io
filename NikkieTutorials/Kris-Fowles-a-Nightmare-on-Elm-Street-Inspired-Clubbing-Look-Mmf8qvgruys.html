on Chris from a Nightmare on Elm Street
2010 look I'm doing a tutorial on it I
watched the movie yesterday night really
late which wasn't really that great of a
plan to do it that way loved the movie
lost everything even though Freddy just
got a little bit annoying with
everything he said he was like dude hon
can you change her voice tone for a
couple of seconds just like 30 entire
movie when he talked it was it was like
the same tone it was like hahaha that's
the only thing that kinda annoyed me
even though I still was creeped out when
I went to bed and I thought when I went
to sleep but I wouldn't get Freddy in my
dreams this look is inspired and more of
recreated by Chris the blonde girl in
the beginning yeah she had beautiful
eyes with braids inner corner highlights
I made the inner corner highlights a
little bit more dramatic because that's
the way I like it
dramatic um I hope you guys like it and
if you want to know how I did this then
please keep on watching
so as always the first thing you want to
do before applying any eye makeup is to
apply a baster let's prevent them from
creasing iods my michael todd nude cream
eyeshadow which is perfect as a base
so therefore what the first color we're
going to use is called wedge and this is
my Mac and I use this for my brows as
well but today we're going to put this
on the lid so I'm just gonna take my 239
by Mac and get some on the brush and
just start applying this on to the lid
if I take it to 26 my Sigma and go back
into wedge and put this into the crease
make sure you don't make like a shape
that goes out because in the movie her
eye shape is really rounded for the brow
bone highlight we're going to take
vanilla by Mac as well and a I'm just s
this is light medium and just put that
onto your problem but you know I'm gonna
do is make your upper lashline really
smoked out and black of course I'm going
to use my carbon by Mac for this so yeah
so I'm going to take this angled brush
my stargazer I'm gonna go into carbon a
lot and your first just gonna line your
I don't smoke things out yet just align
it
so just take more carbon and then just
go up i make short motions so just take
your brush in really short and quick
whites and go up if you want to blend it
even more you can take a 219 by Sigma
and go into a little bit of the carbon
and just smoke it out because this brush
is bigger and not as stiff as the angled
one now pretty well really we're going
to take a black truck flew it on my Mac
and just align your waterline now I'm
going to take this collar by Mac called
corduroy and with that angled brush I'm
just line your lower lash line really
tightly you can't smoke it down a little
bit like I did right here but don't make
it too much I remember it keeps things
around now for the fun part of this look
you're first going to take a pencil
brush like that and go into vanilla and
just um highlight that inner corner
right here just highlight it now I'm
going to take this mixing medium
eyeliner by Mac and just squirt some on
the back of my hand and then take that
I'll add the angled brush again just
wipe it off and go into the mixing
medium and take this Illamasqua for
color liquid metal pellet and go into
this color right there the greeny weird
color
go into that and just
put this on your inner corners and then
I'm going to take sugar pills
Tiare a penguin which is a silver
glittery pigment and take some more of
that mixing medium onto your brush go
into the pigment and go on top of that
LMSs stuff
because I feel like that shimmer is too
much of like a line I'm gonna grab this
um I should go by Mac called forgery
which is basically if shimmer eyeshadow
and just pop that right next to it to
get more shimmer all over I'm gonna
apply some mascara this is volume lashes
million lashes by L'Oreal and I'm going
to apply some fake eyelashes because
that will really make this look flirty
and casual and outgoing as well um I'm
gonna is Manic Panic Black Widow lashes
really thin really long really pretty so
I'm going to use those and then I will
be back to usually what is all melech
and I'm gonna turn my fan on oh my god
okay three lips the first thing we're
going to use is my Mac a lip erase then
put some peach stock lipstick by Mac on
your lips I know this is the Mac give me
liberty of London packaging but they
happen ed MEK pro as well I'm gonna put
this on my upper lip I'm gonna take a
line crying great pink planet which it
looks like that on my lower lip like
that I know it's really bright but then
you're gonna smush them together and
because this is way too pink and this is
definitely not what Chris wore in the
movie I'm gonna go back with peach talk
by Meg peach stock not peach sock and go
over you can leave it like this or you
can add a gloss to make it a little bit
more glossy I'm gonna use my ex
sweetheart lip gloss but that completes
this Chris of a nightmare on the Elm
Street look I hope you guys liked it I
loved the movie loved Chris so yeah I
hope you guys try that this is
definitely appropriate for either a
party or I don't know why I just like it
so thank you guys so much for watching
and the world
I'll see you guys next time I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
