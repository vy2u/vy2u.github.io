Jenner inspired makeup tutorial I have
gotten so many requests for this it's
it's it's getting a little bit out of
hand really so after that I just knew I
had to do a tutorial for you I
absolutely love what Kylie's do
interface lately I love her voluptuous
lips I love those eyelashes the hair the
clothes that everything kylie by far the
best of the entire family right now so
yeah if you want to know how to get this
kylie jenner inspired makeup tutorial
then please keep watching so i already
put my eyelids using my Mac soft ochre
Paint Pot and to bring some definition
into my eyes I'll be using my Tarte be
magnificent palette and the colors I'll
be using are this one and this one and
I'm also taking a bit of makeup geeks
unexpected eyeshadow and just with a
really fluffy brush you softly want to
define your crease you definitely don't
want any harsh lines there or whatsoever
so with a bigger softer blending brush
blend in some definition then taking
makeup geeks unexpected only and on a
more concentrated brush I'm going to
focus this on the outer part of my eyes
blending onto the lid so you want to
place a brush right here on the outer
corner and brush in for the lid I'm
going to take this pinky highlighter
color and mixing it with the color right
next to it and just dust this all over
the lid blending into the darker color
here on the outer part and then with the
blending brush go over it to make it
super soft for the bottom lash line I'm
going to take makeup geek eyeshadow in
latte and this is going right here on
the outer corner blending in towards the
middle and then while you're at it you
also want to blend it down a little tiny
bit and now with an angled brush taking
unexpected by makeup geek again and
continuing towards the inner corners I'm
going to highlight my inner corners
using this shade right here and with a
smaller brush you first want to
concentrate that really on those inner
corners and then with the bigger
blending
she really want to buff that out and go
into the inner areas here for my
eyeliner I'll be using this Illamasqua
precision gel liner in infinity and you
want to keep your eyeliner as thin and
small and cute as possible with a nice
wing at the end
to open up the eyes I'll be using been
nice neutralizer cream crayon and light
no nope ultra light naturally perfect
this look and really make it look like
Kylie Jenner you want to use a lot of
mascara eye lashes mascara I'll be using
my favorite makeup studio waterproof 3d
and extra black for my lower lashes I'll
be using my Mac extended play gigablack
lash and for falsies you want to go as
long and wispy and girly as possible and
I found that in Miss adores number 43
lashes okay so far cheeks Kylie's sort
of warms it up a bit and calls it a day
because all the attention goes to the
eyes and the lips so for cheeks I
already did some contouring of course
because I'm not Kylie and I did that
using LMSs eyeshadow in heroine now I'm
going to go in tarts 24-hour Amazonian
clay blush in exposed and I'm just going
to use this on a bigger brush and sort
of buff my contour in with that and also
bring in some warmth to more the sides
of my cheeks for blush I'm not going in
benefits coralista and I cannot get over
the smell of this it's so good and then
to highlight I'm going to go into a
little bit of Mac's extra dimension I
shadow in a natural flirt on the highest
points of your face for that beautiful
jenner/kardashian glow now onto the lips
now this was actually kind of hard for
me because I own quite a lot of
lipsticks trust me but nothing really
like Kylie is wearing lately and
whenever there was the color that looked
like her color it was shiny and that is
a no-go because Kylie where's met only
so I came up with this combo which I
think will probably match her pretty
good I'm first gonna fill in my entire
lips with a lip pencil by Mac called
boldly bare then to give that a little
bit more dimension on the outer sides
I'm gonna go with the lip pencil by Mac
in stripped down and then to lightly tap
lipstick on top just for the sake of
lipstick I'm gonna go with Yosh Yosh
Yosh
yush by mac and that looks like that
and that guy's completes my Kylie Jenner
inspired makeup tutorial I absolutely
love what she's been doing to her face
and her clothes and her just everything
to herself lately I love Kylie so much
