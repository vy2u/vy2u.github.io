tutorial on the new Kylie Jenner
burgundy palette this recently came out
and no one Kylie Jenner it's probably
blowing up the internet but this is what
this gorgeous little creature looks like
now personally before I start off this
got sent to my mom's home address and
every Kylie product I've talked about in
the past before I have bought with my
own money and got sent to this place
right here where I live and I went to my
mom's place and she was like you have a
package so I opened the package up and
it turned out to be Kylie Jenner and I
was like oh how did she get that address
but I think it's so cool that Kylie sent
me her Fall collection now of course
when you are positive about Kylie Jenner
a lot of people think you're being
bought or you sold your soul or that
you're being sponsored now trust me
Kylie has not sponsored any of my videos
she sells a watch she sells enough
product without my support so know Kylie
didn't sponsor my last video she isn't
sponsoring this one and trust me with
the FTC rules it will be illegal for me
not to tell you if this was sponsored so
let's get that out of the way now let me
tell you about the bronze palette the
bronze
palette wasn't really my cup of tea I
love the colors but my main issue with
that palette was that the shimmers were
really not kind of shimmery and the
mattes I found that the more you blended
them on your eye they all turn out to be
the same color so I wasn't a huge fan of
that palette now this one I ever hope a
ball I created these very grungy warm
toned smoky eyes for fall and I must say
I am really impressed with this palette
the palette looks like this and of
course the tiers have the colors in
chrome of what's inside now this is what
the inside looks like it comes with nine
shadows which are one two three four
five mats and for shimmers it still
doesn't include a mirror
although Kylie has set herself on her
snapchat that the next palette will have
a mirror and honey for $42 mirror today
we have nine luscious cranberry war
faul rich eyeshadows and I personally I
love these colors especially that middle
one I'm wearing it on the inner corners
of my lower lash and obsessed so yeah
without any further ado let's hop right
into the demo slash tutorial on this
look right here using the palette so you
can see how the shadows work on my eyes
how I like them I'll give you my
feedback on every shade that I use and
let's just get comfortable and relaxed
and let's enjoy this Kylie Jenner
burgundy palette review alright the
first thing before I do anything with
this palette is prime because I want
this to last all day long this is my Mac
soft ochre Paint Pot the first color are
going to go in with is penny and I'm
just defining my crease with this now as
we can see the pigment on penny
is in sane and I love the color I love
the warmth I love that orange tone but
still looks it looks like a matte copper
almost is crazy pigmented it blends into
the socket like a dream with such ease
obsessed with penny now I'm going to go
into brick and defining my inner and
outer corners for a halo smoky eye
okay the pigment of the mattes is insane
I ran into a couple of problems with the
mattes in the previous palette I just
felt like once you blended everything
together it all just kind of looked like
the same color but this is pigmented a
velvety smooth and it just it's so easy
to work with
and I'm just going to smoke out and
blend in the edges to give it a nice
smooth gradient and to make it sexy and
seductive for this halo smoky eye I'm
going to darken the inner and outer
corner even more using almond honestly
you guys I am really impressed with the
mats for the center of the lid I'm gonna
go in with the color Dubai okay okay
yeah okay not okay this isn't a bad
shadow I just feel like the consistency
is very thin it's almost as if the
shadow is really thin like it takes a
little bit more effort and pressure to
get the pigmentation of the shimmer to
work and I mean once it's on it's
stunning I just feel like it's it's
where to explain but it's a very thin
type of eyeshadow also I'm not gonna lie
I expected that color to be a little bit
more chromatic and extreme so what I'm
gonna do is go over top with the bronze
the bronze is called LA and this is
going right on the center of Dubai okay
that is a stunning color but again I
feel like the shadow itself is a thin
 it's so hard to explain it's a
thinner shadow but I mean once it's on
it is absolutely stunning and beautiful
I just feel like it's a it's an odd
texture for a shimmer eyeshadow because
it's quite thin for my lower lashline
I'm going to go back into brick and
smoke that baby out
you
and for the inner portion of the lower
lashline I'm gonna be applying burgundy
oh my god this color yes okay it has a
little bit of fall out with that colored
Oh oh my god it's fall in an eyeshadow
okay deepening the entire lower lashline
using almond again and lastly I'm gonna
highlight my inner corners using naked
okay okay I know a lot of people are not
the biggest fan of this color but I
think paired up with all the beautiful
warm tones this on the inner corners
makes it so sultry and different I mean
yes it's too dark for my skin tone but
somehow I don't mind it weirdly enough
though the texture and formula that
feels way different than the other
shimmers I used so this one feels a
little bit more dense a little bit more
easy to work with and it just glides on
easier to finish off the look I'll be
applying some falsies these are Lily
lashes in the style tease
all right so eyes done cheeks almost
done I think we still need a bunch of
glow for this look because doesn't
matter if it's fall winter spring summer
we need to glow I'm going to go in with
my current favorite highlighter which is
by morphe it's a pressed pigment and
it's in the color champagne nights and
it's just uh it's everything so I am
just gonna blind and we can't forget
about the tip of the nose you either
loved it or hated I guess we know which
team I'm on and to finish off this look
I think it will only be fitting if I
apply a Kylie lip kit color dirty peach
throw repaint or hmm
oh my god
let's do moon to make it super super
fallen like her
all right just like that now we're going
to do a little spritz of setting spray
to lock this into place and we call it a
day and that guys is how the kylie
jenner burgundy palette works on the
eyes i over all think it's a really
really cool palette I mean the shimmers
do need a little bit more love when
applying them but the mekin would talk
about the mattes the mattes are
absolutely insane they're smooth buttery
payment it and they are so easy to work
with I am really really impressed by
these mats my absolute favorite shade of
the entire palette is penny it is just
so rich and the ability to make it look
like a matte copper is insane to me I
love it so much so umm yeah
for me the kylie jenner burgundy palette
gets a huge yes I highly recommended it
is a pricey palette it is $42 but I do
think it's worth it as always I do want
to disclaim that makeup is a personal
game something may work for you and it
may not work for me makeup is all about
a personal experience and please don't
judge me on mine so that's it guys
