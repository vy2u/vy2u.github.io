of course on Lady Gaga at the 50th Super
Bowl when she's sang the national anthem
when that camera flew by and I saw a
spark of red which was her suit I
already felt like that was the greatest
moment of my life when I saw that spark
of red I went yes Queen
Lady Gaga killed it Lady Gaga was so
amazing I was so proud of her and when
she blinked and we all saw that
beautiful glittery red lid my Twitter
bombarded with tweets asking for
requests and I just died I drooled a
little and today I'm here to do the look
for you
surprisingly enough I think this look is
perfect for Valentine's Day or for like
clubbing on Valentine's Day it's just a
really cool glittery look anyways
without any further ado if you would
like to know how to get this Lady Gaga
makeup look right here then keep a lot
of shaking alright so the first thing
you want to do is prime and today I'm
going from my Becca backlight priming
filter because I'm going to glow like a
Super Bowl national anthem star for my
nose and chin I need a little bit more
of a prime for that I'm using the Becca
ever matte poreless priming perfect
for a foundation today I'm going to go
for my regular diet Make Up For Ever
Ultra foundation sticks because they're
my favorite so I'm lasting 120 on the
outer perimeter of my face and 117 on
the inner
and with my trusty Beautyblender I'm
going to blend it all in
for concealer I'm going for the Kevyn
Aucoin sensual skin enhancer in SX a1
and lightening it a little bit using my
Kryolan TV pin stick in zero zero and
again blending that in using my Beauty
Blender and I'm going to bake using mine
our soft velvet loose powder in snow
I'm priming my eyelid using Mac soft
ochre Paint Pot with Mac's vanilla
eyeshadow I'm just setting my crease
Arab on area to get it completely
matched and easier to blend later on we
need a little bit of transition in that
crease so first I'm going in with makeup
because metics Peach Smoothie and softly
blending this into the crease using a
Mac two to four brush
now for some depth I'm applying Showtime
also by make oblique cosmetics to the
lid and the crease and I'm first using
this makeup studio number 17 brush to
lay the color down
and with a cosette D 220 brush I'm just
softly blending it into the crease and
with a zoeva 240 brush I'm also applying
it to the lower lash line about halfway
in for the inner corner I'm highlighting
with a mixture of Mac's think kink and
nylon eyeshadow and applying this using
the light portion of my cavity shade +
light eye brush okay now comes the fun
part but also the hardest part the
glitter and what I did was just go a
little bit above my natural crease and I
did give it a little bit of a shape at
the outer corner just to lift the eye a
little bit more a trick is when you're
not doing this on camera
lean forward with your face while
looking down and then pack that glitter
on and that way you will have the least
amount of fallout as an adhesive today
we'll be using the lit clearly liquid
glitter base and the glitter I'll be
using it's also by lit and this is
firecracker number 4 so first laying
that base down and going right over top
with the glitter
and if you feel like the glitter is not
fully opaque there's this amazing
pigment by Illamasqua called Berber and
I'll use that to fill up any holes you
can always use a fan to dry the glitter
a little bit quicker so you will not get
any creases in it now all you want to do
is finish off with some lashes and I'm
using the hood of beauty in Maryland the
gagas cheeks looked very sculpted and
glowy and super natural flushed so wrong
so I'm gonna contour today using my
Kevyn Aucoin
a sculpting powder in medium and my
morphe and 530 brush gonna do a little
quick bit of baking
I mean it's Gaga you want to look
sculpted I remember the day she had
horns I did not forget
and right after brushing it away again
this was just to clean up the contour a
little for highlighter today I'm again
going to take crushed pearl by Anasazi
beverly hills and my morphe M 310 brush
my favorite also highlighting the tip of
my nose and McCombs bald Oh cute and for
blush a little bit of Max peaches and
Cosette number two brush
and spraying a little bit of makeup
forever mist in fix to set this entire
shebang alright for lips doing to go for
something nude and flattering because
there's so much going on in this portion
of the face so you want to keep this
portion at the face a little bit more
wearable I hate that word no I'm kidding
so first going in with a MAC lipstick
called kind of sexy and I'm aiming
towards more of the outer parts of my
lips and going in with a lighter color
after
all right so kind of sexy is on and now
you want to go in with a lighter color
and for me that will be myth by Mac and
now you can wear a gloss over top but I
feel like Gaga's lips were a little bit
more shiny versus glossy so I'm
perfectly fine with this and that guys
