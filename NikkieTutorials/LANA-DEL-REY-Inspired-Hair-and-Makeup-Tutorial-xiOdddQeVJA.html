inspired by Lana Del Rey on the cover of
nylon magazine
Lana looked absolutely fierce edgy and
cool and just like herself with a double
winged liner so that really inspired me
to up my eyeliner game tonight so I did
this all glowy skin I'm even going to
show you how to do this hair because so
many of you have been asking me to do
more hair tutorials so I'm doing it yeah
if you would like to know how to get
this super soft glam Lana Del Rey
inspired makeup look and keep on
watching so the first thing I'm going to
do is of course prime and for this enemy
is my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot with a
contour powder in my zoeva 228 luxe
crease brush I'm bringing in some
definition into the crease and also
bringing that portion slightly towards
the bridge of my nose right here and
that will help slim down your entire
nose now going in with the pixi
mesmerising mineral palette in the color
mineral contour and with this shade
right here going to deepen the crease a
little bit more
for the lid amusing this pixi
mesmerizing mineral palette in opal glow
and this color right here is going on to
the lid
for the lower lashline I'm taking that
same contour powder and applying it from
outer to inner corners for the inner
corners and going back into that first
pixie palette and taking this white
color to highlight
first with a little bit of black
eyeshadow I'm going to map out where I
want the lines to go
so now that we have this guide we're
going to check it with liquid liner
today I'm using the Pixy cat eye ink
now I'm applying some white coal to the
waterline and to finish off the look
some falsies and these are by Lena
lashes and they're either Kendall or
Kylie for cheeks a lot I didn't really
have a lot going on so I'm only going to
contour a little bit and add just a tiny
bit of warm for this I'm taking my Tarte
contour palette Park Avenue princess
contour palette the bronzer but mixing
it with Bobbi Brown's eyeshadow in wheat
my contour powder so together this is
like a contour and bronzer and one and
I'm applying it with a Mac 135
this is my new obsession credits go to
desi Burcham and I've watched a lot of
the Kylie Jenner app tutorials and
almost all of her makeup artists start
their contour way higher than I would do
it so I was like hmm
I want to try that one day and this is
the day so normally I would contour like
right here I would start it right here
and then aim for my mouth but they just
go like in that curve of the hairline
they come right there and then above the
top of the lip and then contour like
that oh I like it
okay then I'm also gonna contour the
hairline and forehead just at already
about 20 bad I don't want to go too
overboard with blush because there was
barely any on Lana's skin so I'm again
going into this palette right here and
taking the blush of it on the apples of
the cheeks I made of myself now we're
going to highlight because Lana
definitely was super glowy I'm gonna go
for mary lou and it's in the the balm
manizer sister palettes got all the lou
manizer x' in it and again with my 135
brush I'm just gonna pick it up and
we're going to go for that strong or
easy type of highlight
oh ok ok ok ok ok ok ok then also I'm
going to highlight the tip of my nose
Cupid's bow
um everything on my face first click
tube Oh mother flippin nose now going to
douse my skin in fix+ because we need
that do we need that glow
we need that Delray mm-hmm when you
think have enough add more for lips for
doing Lana Del Rey so of course we're
going to over line them don't fill me up
with your hate I don't care I love
overlining lips so first I'm going in
with the NYX natural lip pencil
then for lipstick I'm going to fill in
using gerard cosmetics buttercup and
then Lana had a little bit more of a
pink touch so going in with the Gerard
cosmetics lipstick in fairy godmother
and this is going right in the center
and the guy says all you have to do for
the makeup now let's go on to this males
okay so for the hair Lana had it really
casually curled and then the front was
clipped back in a very cool way this is
what it looked like so first I'm going
to curl my hair and for this I'm going
to use a new curling set by new me the
octo wand and the octo one comes with
eight attachable barrels and this one by
far is the funkiest because we all know
what it looks like so it comes with
eight barrels and have been trying to
set for a couple of weeks now and today
to get those really natural casual loose
curls that long ahead we're going to go
in with this barrel right here they
place it onto this device right here so
you just plug it in and then you lock it
by twisting this little portion right
here and then you want to turn it on it
heats up to you 450 degrees and of
course I hooked you up with some
discount codes if you want to buy the
octo wand for 129 dollars plus a free
argan oil then use code Nicki loves you
and for $50 off any styling tool on new
me use the code here we go Sunday Funday
cuz I upload on a Sunday you get it so
use those codes if you want to discount
but for now if you want the long edge
alright hair just follow it all so the
goal here is curls but also not curls
and defined but also not defined and
sexy but not too sexy and just mmm so I
just grab random chunks of hair I take
the octo wand and I just wrapped the
hair across it and
leave the ends out and this will give it
a really nice body and curl but it will
keep it texturized and edgy and cool
with leaving the ends out and see how it
creates this way but this is more
straight with Walker also to give it
more texture and even more cool and edgy
looking you can twist the part that
you're about to curl and then curl it
around the barrel and twist the ends
twist some twists those hands and let go
and kind of pull on that end as well now
for the front portion you want to take
your bangs and brush them back and then
as you're brushing them twist them in a
couple of times go underneath your hair
and then pin it with a bobby pin grow
out the hair droop it over top and then
with a little bit of hairspray
you want to spray it for that nice messy
casual look and also I like having that
frizz for this look and then repeat on
this side and that guys concludes this
