so for today's video I figured why not
ring in the New Year with some full-on
glam I mean if you ask me glam has to be
there all year round
not just with the holidays not just with
special events no just every day should
be glam and if there's anyone around you
in your life saying that you can only
wear glam looks around the holidays or
special events cut that fool right out
of your life because you don't need that
negativity around you I'm also wearing a
Star Wars t-shirt because I've never
seen the movies but everyone's so
positive about the force awakens so I'm
like maybe I should watch him the shirt
is a start yeah without any further ado
if you would like to know how to get
this super glam look then keep on
watching alright so the first thing you
want to do is prime of course and for
this I'm using my Nivea men aftershave
balm and if you're new to my channel and
you're like what what is going on then
just check back on any older video I've
done before and I'll probably talk about
why I love this as a prime and the goal
is to keep going until it becomes tacky
and I'm sticky as something so we're
good okay so for foundation I'm gonna go
in with the Marc Jacobs a remarkable
full coverage foundation I'm in the
color ivory and ivory light and you know
I love my pancake I love my full
coverage layer of foundation and I'm
telling you right now that with this one
you only need the tiniest amount because
it is so full coverage that even for my
standards I was like oh okay that might
be a little bit too much so go little on
this foundation and then with a damp
Beauty Blender I'm just going to apply
that all over my face
watch watch duh I have so little on my
Beauty Blender and I am covering on my
entire face with just that this is
insane insanely good
just one dap into my puddle of
foundation and i'm covering my entire
face if you want me to do a full-on
review in-depth full-on review on this
let me know in the comments below and
i'll do that for you
for concealer I'll be using my it
cosmetics bye bye underarm
you
okay and now studying everything with
powder and I'm using my Beauty Blender
because I saw a lot of girls used our
Beauty Blender to bake and I was like ah
I wouldn't because in my Beauty Blender
I'm begging my Beauty better okay now
I'm going to do my brows and when I
off-camera and then it will be the first
thing we're going to do for the eyes as
always is some soft ochre Paint Pot by
Mac now taking max Pro emphasized powder
and I'm setting my crease and brow bone
area to help blending later on the first
shadow will be going in with is by
makeup geek and this is the color
vintage and with say more feet m51 aid
I'm just applying that to the crease and
creating some depth
and also connecting that to the outer
corners then going in with uh Nastasia
Beverly Hills eyeshadow in dusty rose to
blend it out and the best brush for this
is a Mac 224 on the little be applying
this gorgeous new Anasazi berlioz
eyeshadow this is called macaroon and
I'm applying that with a damp makeup
studio number 17 brush and with this I'm
also softly cutting that crease and I
with a jus vyas place flat definer brush
I'm cutting the crease a little bit more
using a darker color on the lower lash
line up first go in using on the South
Everglades eyeshadow in aubergine and a
Mac two to eight brush now with a Mac
two one three brush and petal pusher by
makeup geek cosmetics I'm going to smoke
that lower lash line out softly now it's
time for some fun I'm applying the new
makeup geek cosmetics sparkler in halo
to the inner corners of my lower lash
line and to the center of the lid and to
make it six some violet Voss glitter
glue
so first going to dot some of that glue
glitter glue on the center of the lid
and apply a halo over top look at that
oh yes you really want to live on top of
the glitter glue to get a minimum amount
of fallout and then same goes for the
inner corner
and then darken underneath using
aubergine and vintage and I'll lastly
I'm applying some nylon by Mac to my
inner corners to highlight and for this
I'm using a Juvia splays flat shader
brush now it's time for some lashes and
I'm using my hood of beauty scarlet
alright for cheeks today it's 2016 and
we're still going to look sculpted AF so
toe and applying it with a more feet M
five-30
brush my favorite contour Rush Shara
I mean what a difference a little bit of
contouring can make I mean oh okay then
to warm up the face a little bit more I
taking my Too Faced light medium
chocolate bronzer that's my fave with my
mac 135 brush and it's just to add a
little bit of warmth that's it nothing
else for highlighter there is no other
option than pearl by Becca and of course
my favorite highlighting brush this is
by morphe and it's the m3 ten Oh Happy
