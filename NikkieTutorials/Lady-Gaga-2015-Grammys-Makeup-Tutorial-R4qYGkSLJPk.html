today I'm bringing you a tutorial
inspired by Lady gaga at the 2015
Grammys the red carpet look I thought
that Lady Gaga looked absolutely
stunning it was by far my most favorite
makeup look of the entire evening and I
know before y'all get crazy on me again
yes the wig is back I'm doing a lady
Gaga tutorial here today guys
Lady Gaga Lady Gaga's life support our
wigs and I kind of get why this wig
bothers to you because of the dark roots
but I'm getting the dark roots fixed
next week so yeah without any further
ado if you want to know how to get this
Lady Gaga look right here then please
stay tuned alright so I already put down
a base to prevent everything from
creasing and now it's time to move on to
the first eyeshadow the first I should
I'll be using is caramel by uh Nastasia
Beverly Hills and I'm applying this
color on the outer crease a little bit
higher up than I would usually place my
crease color and this is for some
transition and warmth because you could
definitely see on Gaga that she had all
these cool tone shades going on but then
in the khrushchev this warmth so I'm
just gonna place this here and then also
wing it out and of course it wouldn't be
a gaga look if we didn't go all the way
to the inner corners now I'm going to go
into Mac's plumage and this will be used
as the winged shape so with an angled
brush I'm going to create a line that is
going towards the end of my eyebrow and
you want to go high up Gaga's line
almost reached the end of her eyebrows
so it's totally fine to go high up and
go extreme with this one and then from
that line go ahead and pull it back to
the lid and of course fill in using that
same color then I'm gonna blend that out
with a pencil brush using the same Mac
color but also mixing it with a little
bit of Anastasia Beverly Hills mermaid
and literally all you want to do is grab
that pencil brush and diffuse the edges
of the line that you just created and
for now it doesn't have to be super
precise on the
but the closer you come toward the point
of the eyeliner you want to keep it
really tiny and need to precise so just
keep lending and making it soft and
diffused for the lid and first going in
with this color pop super shock shadow
in sugar and this bad boy is going on to
the center of the lid so plumage and
mermaid kind of stop here and then from
there you want to continue is in sugar
and then going over top with Anastasia
Beverly Hills I see they're forming
inner third and inner corners I'm gonna
take a legend also by Anasazi Beverly
Hills whoo this is going right on that
inner third and in a first now going
back into plumage by Mac I'm going to
create a more definite line so right now
it's all kind of like cooling air we're
getting there
but I want a super defined line as if
it's an eye liner going way up now for
the lower lash line I'm again taking
plumage and we're running this as I said
on the lower lash line but you want to
connect it to that eyeliner part right
here just connect it to it and then what
you want to do is drag it towards the
inner corners then I'm taking mermaid
and I see by honestly personally Hills
again and smoking it out alright now
what really made this look weird the
sparkles and the sparkles were all over
and I love that so I'm gonna take my
dual effects and shine my makeup studio
and I'm going to dazzle it all over the
light parts of the eye
and that's it for the eyeshadows i'm not
gonna place the mascara do you give a
base for my lashes and the lashes i'll
be using our right of the lure and these
are the adult me up for the cheeks
gaagaa do really have a whole lot going
on so all I'm gonna do is bronze and
warm up my complexion a bit using some
contouring powders and rounds earthen
blushes and highlighters first part is
I'm going to use as always it's my
heroine eyes shadow by Illamasqua then
to further warm up my complexion I'm
taking the Too Faced milk chocolate
bronzer then for blush and then he is a
shocker
limeños oh and then sigh highlight my
complexion I'm gonna use the Becca
shimmering skin Perfector in moonstone
using my NARS eita brush after my
January hips and God knows a lot of
people told me that the nurse ether
brush is perfect for highlighting so I'm
gonna give it a go today wham bam bam
I mean it's it's okay alright so what I
think of it is that I have to dip into
my highlighting powder a lot more with
the nurse EDA as opposed to my Inglot
for SS brush so so far I I'm just really
not a fan of this brush I'm sorry I'm
also just gonna highlight the bridge of
my nose tip of my nose keeps both the
works and that's it for the cheeks
alright last step is the lips and you
don't really want to over draw the lips
with the pencil or anything you just
want to nude him out to get a really
nice fleshy skin new tone and for that
I'll be using Mac's flash pot and then
you sort of want this natural flush of a
gloss over top and the product that
totally rang my bell for this look was
the bourgeois color burst mmm color
bursts it all faded off because I've had
it for so long but the color is peach on
the beach and it's one of those glossy
balms that just
the tiniest bit of color but still gives
it color and Sheen and flush so this is
going right over top and that's it guys
that concludes my Lady Gaga Grammys 2015
