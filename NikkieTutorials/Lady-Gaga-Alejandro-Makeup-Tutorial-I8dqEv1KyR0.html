Lady Gaga makest tutorial I'm going to
do the look where she has almost no
eyebrows and no lashes no blush and
bright red dark lips with really unusual
new eyes I am never gonna wear that out
because it is so ugly first of all I
didn't do this tutorial because it
wasn't necessary that pretty
I didn't look because you could see that
our makeup artist fun doing this I mean
you do not see this look every single
day on the streets you can actually
tweak this look a bit by adding liquid
liner darker colors to the eyes and more
blush to the face and make this a more
wearable look oh yeah stay tuned
so the first step in this tutorial is to
do your skin Lady Gaga has a really
peeled out almost white skin so we're
going to do everything to achieve that
look I'm going to grab my Max Factor
lasting performance 101 ivory beige
foundation and I'm going to put a
something on my hand and then to make
that a lighter I'm going to take mennick
Penix Manic Panic dreamtone and this is
a white foundation and I use this every
day in my normal foundation routine as
well because I'm so pill um I it's
really hard for me to find really glad I
found Asians that match my skin tone so
I always use this to make them lighter
and match my skin completely but right
now we're going to take a little bit
more just to make it even wider for a
guide let's look I'm going to grab a
q-tip and mix them together I like to
take a 187 by Sigma and just buff that
into my skin I like to go over my lip
steel because you know I hit my lip
color so I like to blend that out this
is still way too dark so I'm just going
to grab the white foundation and put
some more on to my hand and then I take
my 187 brush again and just dip that
into the white foundation only and just
take a little bit and just stipple that
on to the spots you want to be lighter
and then blend them out just to give
your dad like really really peeled out
look I'm going to grab some concealer
this is Mac select moisture color in
nw20 and nc15 um so called studio finish
concealer just going to grab a 2:22 Y
Sigma and blend it out now you want to
set the foundation and of course you
want a powder that is not your skin tone
but just one
to tints or shades or I don't know
lawyer and I'm going to take it's the
white one I want to take medic panic
vampires veil pressed powder looks like
that
and it's this color and it looks really
ll but in real life it's almost white
and this is the color moonlight and I
also have a white one which is called a
virgin so I first got to take my 150
brush by Sigma and I'm going to go into
moonlight and I'm going to go into it's
powder right yes I'm going to go into
the powder and set my foundation just
really really lightly and then with the
same brush I'm going to go into the
white one and go over my face as well to
make me look even wire now it's time to
do an overly dramatic contour on your
cheekbones and the temples of your face
um Lady Gaga is personal white and with
a great contour so I'm going to take NYX
blush in taupe yeah guess what I just
got called by my school and um I passed
my graduation is now I'm gonna cry um I
passed um no more high school for me I'm
going to M sit and uhm I passed and
you're overly dramatic gonna contour let
me do that slide start right there and
you want to stop around your eye so if
you can see like this your eye you want
to stop right there but this is not
enough of a contour yet you really want
to go outside of the box and contour
your face like hell the price of Lady
Gaga in this music video are really
really light now I am really lucky that
I don't have really a dark eyebrows from
myself already
so I'm just
let's grab some studio finish concealer
in NC 15 again I'm just going to take a
brush and work that through my brows to
make them even lighter than they already
are the weird thing about this look is
that she uses no mascara no liner except
for white eyeliner and just some shadows
and that's it it's really really simple
I'm going to get my Michael taught nude
eyeshadow base with a Sonia Kashuk brush
I'm just going to apply that all over my
lid and then I'm going to take my ring
finger and blend it out the first
beautiful color we're going to use is by
Illamasqua
and the musca and this is called a
Ferrari your or if you are it looks like
that it's like a new champion color and
that is going right onto the inner
corners right here and going to go up
into the inner third of the lower of the
eyelid so in a third and right here and
go up and in the video the highlight in
the inner corner is way way way lighter
so I'm going to grab some nylon by Mac
and I'm going to grab that with the same
brush and go over that fewer array in
the inner corner and go high up with
this because in the video it goes really
high up as well now I'm going to grab
chest by Mac and this is like a darker
champagne color and I'm going to take
that and a honey lust for some extra
glitter and you take that color and
apply this to the middle of the lid and
go up slow so you take those colors and
go up go up go up go up for some um
definition into the eye I'm going to
grab two colors I'm going to take next
bronze
this is Mike's brahms and we're going to
spread set in taupe and this is sudden
taupe and I'm going to take some of
those two with a 217 my Sigma and you're
going to go into the crease with this
and go down a little bit and then just
blend it up into the inner corners like
that and then just make it blurry and
let it go out like that don't be scared
just blend it out a lot go high up if
you like and especially you want to go
into here but not my do not make it too
dark because then we get the Sat look
and it happened to me quite a lot now in
videos that I did that and then I would
look really sad those videos never wind
up by the way then I like to take my 252
my Mac and vanilla and not really to
highlight but just to Matan out that
problem and to get the shape right of
the seven taupe and the bronze now I'm
going to grab this angled brush by
stargazer and I'm going to go into nylon
and if you're Rory and I'm going to line
my eyes because in the video it looks
like right next to her or right above
her eyelashes there's a really like hard
so we want that to I pretty lower lit
it's really simply going to take a 219
by Sigma I'm going to go into bronze and
Sun and help blend right here and you
can be smudgy with this you don't have
to be neat with this at all and then go
in and then take some jest remember this
is just
I'll put that right here you can always
take some honey laughs and go over and
then take a nylon and Ferrari again and
inner corners men to make your eyes even
bigger and weirder
you're going to take my exam pencil in
milk again and line your waterline and
of course don't forget the mold that
gagas or write a blow to I I'm going to
take gosh truly brown and just fake one
I'm gonna start off with a concealer to
completely blank those lippies out and
if you look scary you're doing it right
because seriously I do not look healthy
right now then I'm going to take my
number sixteen Martello Rimmel London
thousand kisses state a lip pencil just
the line my lips and then fill it in
once you have filled your lips in with
the lipliner you're just going to fill
them up with a lipstick this is my ex
lipstick in a black cherry I have to
swear to God that dis lipsticks are one
of my all-time favorites I mean the
mechs are good but these ones are so
creamy so soft they have a lot of colors
I love them
so I'm going to take black cherry and
this is a really really dark red color
and this is going on top and that
completes this Alejandro Lady Gaga
makeup tutorial I did the look where she
had almost no lashes on no eyebrows no
liquid liner know anything just really
porcelain skin um really neutral eyes a
little bit to neutral with bright lips
so I hope you guys like this if you want
to take this look a couple of steps
further to wear it out just take your
liquid eyeliner and paint on some liquid
lines um add some mascara at some
falsies add some darker colors to this
eye look and you can wear it it's out
completely outside the house so um thank
you guys so much for watching I hope you
guys liked it um yeah thank you guys for
watching
