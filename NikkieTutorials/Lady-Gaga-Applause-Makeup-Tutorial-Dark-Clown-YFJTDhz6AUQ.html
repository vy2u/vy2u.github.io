applause week here on nikkietutorials
welcome to day number one of the three
days welcome to this batshit crazy look
which I absolutely love welcome today
I'm going to do my first applause look
and this is the evil sort of galeano
messy clown look so yeah without any
further ado if you want to know how to
get this Lady Gaga applause
evil clown messy artsy clown look then
please keep on watching so there's gonna
be a lot of steps throughout this video
but please just look at what I'm doing
and just kind of take notes from that I
won't be able to tell you everything
that I'm doing because it's sort of like
gut feeling as well just kind of doing
what feels good um so that's just a
little disclaimer so I'm gonna start off
by making my entire face white sort of
like this clownish white because that is
well Gaga was wearing as well now there
are two products that I suggest you can
use this design pro xstream color art in
white sensation and this is one of those
water-activated sort of paints so I'm
actually gonna do my base with this and
then when I have a couple of like uneven
spots I'm going to take my Kryolan TV
paint stick in number 70 which is white
and then just dab it over and then set
it all with powder
so the base is a pipe with my design pro
xstream color art in white sensation and
now I'm going to perfect sort of the
coverage with my Kryolan TV paint stick
and number white number white number 70
so I'm almost kind of highlighting my
face with the pain Sigma Kryolan to give
it more dimension and of course more of
that white feeling but still give my
face some structure now it's time for
the eyes now I won't be able to talk a
lot throughout this because it's really
just sort of playing with it what I can
tell you is that I'm going to make my
fundament my base with a black eye
shadow and for that I will be using
sugar pills bulletproof I'm just gonna
define my eyes and a really round oval
way and especially around the nose trick
and after that I'm just going to take my
makeup forever flash color palette and
just play with the yellow and the silver
and the gold and this look is all about
messy fun
so the main colored that pops out along
with the black is the yellow so I just
placed the yellow on the highlight
points and just spots ryr1 and basically
and now it's time for the black
hahahaha sorry and I noticed that on one
side the black was really going down
into her nose line so doing that as
though
so I like to go with powders first and
work with wet products sort of greasy
products last so I'm going to cheeks now
and I'm going to sculpt and sort of make
a clown esque cheek with my illamasqua
powder blush and kiss and then I'm going
to darken it up with bullet proof of
sugar pill again then I'm gonna make
some bluff plus red eye shadow whoo
sugar pill in it and even some pink
again just have fun with it
applause applause applause oh my god
we're getting there it's really starting
to look like Gaga's crazy clown taking a
little bit of black and going batshit
crazy and again don't be too perfect
with this if it's blotchy and not well
blended that's what you're going for
Gaga with this evil clown look it's not
supposed to look like perfection it's
supposed to look like art it's supposed
to look like you had like the time of
your life and you've got you've got dick
slept in two faiths by a clown the time
has come for the awesomeness that I call
the makeup forever flesh colour palette
I'm just going to take the gold and the
silver and the yellow and what I'm going
to do is take a brush like I'm going to
take a mini fan brush and just go crazy
with this this already is crazy there's
no stopping now just go for it
hahaha this is awesome I love this gonna
take some of the white and brush that
through a little bit of my brows because
she had some brow whiteness going on
going in the black I'm just gonna run
this along the lid and just grease that
up
all up in that nose line crease go for
it gonna take the silver and mix that on
the middle of the lid and blend it with
the black to make it messy again and
then you can always take more black and
take away any silver that you do not
want there some of the gold bully
applied to the inner corners now I'm
going to add these sort of galeano do
you're inspired wonky eye brow I'm going
to take this Mac acrylic paint in black
black and take an eyeliner brush and all
you literally want to do is listen BAM
and now it's time for the lips I'm what
I'm going to use for that is Prince new
are by Mac and just apply this to the
lips and go crazy I'm sorry the
perfectionist in me couldn't deal with
it I changed the brow I didn't like the
other one
finish this entire Lagos I'm going to
take my Elizabeth Arden 8 hour cream put
loads and shits of gloss on my lips on
my eyeballs and even a little bit up
until the brow bone just to give it all
that really nice shiny glossy finish
I looked really disturbing when I did
that
on did so because I don't have to have
black headband I just take a pajama
shirt and just you can do this with it
like do what da go was wearing oh she
didn't let the ears out you can do that
you can sort of sculpted as if you have
nice cartoonish black hair I kind of
like it like this so that ladies and
