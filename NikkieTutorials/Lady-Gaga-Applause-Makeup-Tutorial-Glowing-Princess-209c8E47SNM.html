installment for lady gaga
applause week this is my absolute
favorite look this was a look that Gaga
who is wearing unsorted like the runway
with that leg with flowers in it and
it's sort of a really beautiful take on
the Galliano Dior kind of type of look
so I kind of took my own little spin on
it I absolutely love doing this makeup I
it's totally transforming yourself into
the sort of Dior Galliano goodness so if
you want to know how to get this very
extreme Gaga look then please keep on
watching it's weird if you laugh at me
right now I will find you and I will
punch you so the first thing I'm gonna
start off with is the bleaching fake
bleaching the brow it's just like I did
in my previous Gaga tutorial and for
this I will be using my crayon aqua
color in ivory and just fake bleach the
hell out of your eyebrow so I'm gonna
start off by first brushing all the
hairs down with the product and then
brush up just like that so the first
thing I'm gonna do is create a whole new
shape to my eyes so I'm just gonna go
into that no sign and wisp it all out
and just give myself an entire sort of
new dimension of my skull so I'm gonna
take my face art i shadow pollen in
number one and I'm gonna use this color
at this color and a little bit of that
just some greyish cool colors to kind of
sculpt that look in I'm gonna start off
here on the side of my crease and go all
the way up and then in that nose line
we've been through this before I'm not
telling you why any longer I'm gonna
take a bit of copper plate and kid I
shadow by mater I just dropped it and go
on and deepen it a bit more at that nose
line and now with this purpley taupe
color and this gray color I'm gonna
bring even more dimension in that nose
line so you kind of want to tilt your
head back and really draw it in high up
right there and then of course you want
to blend it up I'm also gonna use that
color on the outer part of my crease
again and blend it to like the middle
taking this color and this color again
you want to apply that to your bottom
lid too like halfway in I know you guys
just look is crazy right now it's
probably crazy at the end as well
because it's a crazy look you don't do
grocery shopping with this let's get
that out of the way so once you have
that blend it right there
swing it out and then with kid I shadow
just blend that out to the sides really
nicely so you kind of want to blow it
out to the side of your eyes of sort of
like your temples and basically all you
want to do is just keep adding depths to
this entire thing and then blend it out
and after that I will be back for the
shimmery craziness bracelet I will be
using sweet C and a pigment by Mac from
sugar pills Col chemistry Pelin gonna
take Diamond eyes and you wanna
highlight the inner corner with this
your new inner corner because your new
inner corner is way up then blend it to
the lid mixing it with that sweet Sienna
and then also on the bottom now what I'm
going to do is take my infamous makeup
studio dual effects in shine and sort of
a glitter of the entire inner corner
with that I'm gonna pop some bed night
neutralizer cream crayon and this is a
red concealer number one I'm gonna give
my eyelashes a really good curl and to
finish ice off I'm gonna take that
bleach product again the fake bleach
product for the brows I'm just kind of
DAB my spoolie and dad do you want to
bleach your lower lashes so as you can
see I redid the most part of the face
what I will walk you through it I
applied some foundation first I use my
Mac face somebody in white and c1 and
then for this blush a flash
craziness going on my sugar pale eyes
shadows in Dali pop and poison plum and
then as a transition blending color I'm
going to use max love clout blush and
this to kind of feather out the edges
and just give myself a really nice blend
in this crazy lot just start at your
shape line and just do this all in a
round circular motion to get the
blending to perfection make some more
and just blend it in then go down here
to your jaw blend it out and blend it up
now I'm gonna take a law of cloud by Mac
and just feather it out and make it a
little bit more blended and I get the
exact same thing to my forehead I just
place it here and then blended it down
and the curve is sort of going like this
I also place some on my chin and blended
it up and on the top of my nose and the
top of the nose highlight or color
really reminds me of the Grinch the
little girl Taylor Momsen
then to really perfect this look it's
time for some crazy highlighting the
highlighter we'll be using is the
diamond effects gemstone collection in
gold stone so that is going here on the
bridge of my nose and a little top of my
nose on my Cupid's bow
now I'm gonna take vanilla pigment by
MEK and just make that highlight like
insanely and samely highlight it oh my
god right on top baby oh look at that
shine look at that shine and this is
also going on the entire top of my nose
okay I'm just gonna get that pink a
little blend with the highlighter to
give it all one smooth perfect it look
as far as this could ever look perfect
fried lips you first want to completely
blank them out with a concealer I'm
gonna use my illamasqua rich liquid
foundation then I'm gonna take max lip
mix in Burgundy and this is a really
nice two color because if you built this
up it becomes this dark purpley color
but if you blend it down it becomes a
sort of wine red and that is exactly
what I want for this look and what you
want to do is sort of open your lips and
then Pat it on the inside and sort of
feel like a Geisha shape
and to finish enough you want to put a
layer of glass on top and I'm using my
Elizabeth Arden 8 hour cream and now all
you want to do little monsters is take a
piece of see-through fabric and go
session Galliano Gaga
