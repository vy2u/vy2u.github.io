number two for my Lady gaga applause
week on nikkietutorials this is the
somewhat more natural such neutral look
she was rocking in the video this is
where she was wearing the bikini with
the big hair so I was like a like a
beach lioness I know lots of you were
like that's a super natural super easy
look it's kind of not
because what Gaga's makeup artist did
was he kind of really sculpted her eyes
making them look really sunken in he
gave her an amazing contours I'm shine
and I like to call this sort of like an
albino alien sculpted look because it
has a really sculpted deep sunken eyes
the really strong contour on the face
and then the bleached brows and no
mascara and then two super nude lips it
just kind of looks like an alien
glowy sculpted goodness so yeah without
any further ado if you want to know how
to get this natural Gaga applause look
then please keep on watching so the
first thing you want to do for this Gaga
natural look with an edge is bleach the
eyebrows though of course we're not
gonna actually bleach them for real
because no so what we're gonna do is
fake bleach the eyebrows and I already
did a full like complete video on this a
couple of years ago and ah the link is
in the info yeah
the link is in the infobox below so to
fake bleach my eyebrows today I am going
to use my Mac Pro long lash in barrel
lash and this is a mascara with a nude
sort of color and to give the hair is an
extra extra light feeling I'm gonna use
my aqua color by Kryolan and just use a
color close to your hair or maybe
somewhat wider if you're a blonde that
is if you're a darker person then just
take the color of your skin tone to
bleach it and make it look as if you
have no eyebrows who have you watched
the iTunes Festival where Gaga did seven
songs of our pop what was your favorite
mine were manicure I think manicure
should be her next single
I love aura but I don't like the
beginning and even the sung art pop
itself was really fun as well so leave
it in a comment section below what was
your favorite song at the iTunes
Festival so you want to start off by
searching the hairs down to first
completely cover that sort of direction
of the brows and then you want to brush
them up and then they already sort of
have this nice bleached feeling but I
feel like Gaga really went there and
they actually bleached her brows like
for real
so I'm going to take the Kryolan color
and activate it with some fix+
and just go over for an even better
fully all look at that I love it so I
already went ahead and prime my eyelids
using my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot and I
want to take this blush by Mac called
shadowy and with shadowy I'm just
dusting some definition on my lower lash
line and then with an angled brush I'm
sort of going to make a line away from
the inner corner sort of leaving a gap
between your real sort of waterline and
a new waterline I'm going to blend that
using Mac's kid eyes shadow I'm going to
make a mixture between Meg's kid and
copperplate eyes shadow and apply that
to the crease so you just want to start
off right here in your crease and apply
this in a really round way and then what
we're going to do is apply this all the
way to the inner part of the crease and
in a moment I'm going to shock you a bit
I think I'm gonna take kid only don't be
afraid I'm gonna go to my brow bone sort
of like the beginning of my brow and you
kind of want to make it really round it
and fluffy in here and now you can see
that you're really in that nose line and
this is a trick that Gaga I use this a
lot okay and here comes a shocker from
the point you want to blend it till the
nose to give your nose some definition
shocker
taking taupe blush by Mac and I'm going
to complete
you blow their crease up so blend it up
all the way to the brow bone and just
keep a little space open for a highlight
but just give this entire look a really
sunken in sort of skeleton feeling
almost I'm going to connect to lower
lash line to the crease just like so and
then you guessed it blend it out even
more and really make this big and sunken
in and sort of smoky and alien like for
the eyelid I will be using this Kiko
long-lasting wet and dry eye shadow in
number 200 and I'm going to apply that
wet using my fixed plus I just look at
the color it's so stunning okay for this
inner spot right here so that gap
between the rear waterline and the new
one and then this inner spot right here
that was really light with gaga plus it
was a really silvery sparkly color down
first gonna light it up with my pure
white chroma graphic pencil by Mac then
go over with Mac's Blanc type I shadow
and to give myself that pop up a silver
jewel sparkle on the inner corners I
will be using my makeup studio jewel
effects and shine
to really open up the water line I will
be using my Ben Nye neutralizer cream
crayon in red concealer number one and
in the middle apply a bit of the chroma
graphic white and now all you want to do
for the ice is curl the lashes and don't
apply any mascara because this look is
all about sort of the contours and and
the alien-esque sort of albino look so
just curl the lashes and leave it for
the cheeks it's all about the contouring
and the highlighting there was no blood
there was no pop of finger on her cheeks
there it was just like contoured and
ready to be a paused so I'm first going
to contour with my NYX blush in taupe
I'm going to start in a line right here
sort of following that freely key thing
in your ear sort of that is your
starting point from there go up into a
triangle so we're one triangle and of
course blend it out then I'm going to
include the temples as well and sort of
this part right here actually the real
temple and then the side of the head as
well the forehead and then this Rick I
really love is by going to the side of
this contour and sort of go onto your
jaw line and then underneath and blend
it down so it sort of becomes a
connected line to this shape right here
so you have a shape here and then Wu
then I'm going to take a fluffier brush
to blend it out but I'm gonna blend it
out using my bone beige blush by Mac and
then literally place your brush and just
flare it out and make it softer and even
the side of that just make it softer and
then also do your chin and your neck
really contour that Chad okay now it's
time for a shiny highlight to give
yourself that alien-esque
sort of outerspace glow I'm going to use
my diamond effects gemstone collection
in special diamond number three this has
that red pink shine and then on top I'm
going to apply some vanilla pigment by
Mac to give myself that ultimate
alien-esque outerspace glow so two
special diamond one first also on the
nose and the Cupid's bow
then with vanilla go over it to give
yourself that ultimate glow free lives
Duggar were a really pale nude color so
my suggestion for that is myth lipstick
by Mac and then just Pat it in to make
it somewhat more wearable
against a little quick tip and this is
very optional this is just pure for when
you're on the photo shoot or something
what daca was wearing as well was a
layer of gloss on her eyelids so what I
suggest for this is the Elizabeth Arden
8 hour cream and all you literally want
to do is take the gloss and drop it on
the eyeball and that will really give it
an awesome sort of high-fashion gloss
slash shine and that little monsters and
