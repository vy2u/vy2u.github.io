inspired look the girl look the
government-owned alien territory and
space or something I'm gonna do a look
on that I was inspired by like the
triangle dot that comes up in the
beginning of Born This Way it's like the
unicorn in it and then I was inspired
that she's like floating in outer space
in something so I just make that
triangle and I just added a bunch load
of glitters and fake lashes the reason I
put my bangs in front of my other eye is
because I'm in a hurry so I can do the
other eye but you kind of get the idea
you can do both eyes or just one eye
really simple and this um so yeah for a
list of all products you used to go to
my website nikkietutorials dot-com
learned all of this from a teacher from
B Academy Post called sesor she did this
once with the Galliano lesson and I was
so inspired by Lady Gaga it's you
recreated if you want to know how I did
this then please keep on watching it so
the first thing I want to do is take
some tape some tape that is nice for the
skin this is a really soft one and what
you want to do with the tape is like
measure like put a triangle shape around
your eye and we're using tape for that
to not mess up any things with the pain
and stuff you don't have to use tape I'm
just gonna do because it's way faster
keep in mind that your face is round I
did a face chart
I'm the look we're going for today sort
of and that is paper so the tape really
went on really smooth on it because it's
flat but our faces aren't flat so I just
make sure that the lines are straight
hey how you doing
penitential face paint and block anyway
and I'll just take some fixed rush just
make it wet and take a sponge the sponge
and then just dab it up
now take the tape off
and obviously see is that the triangle
is not perfect so I'm gonna take just
some q-tips and son chlorin stuff and
just make everything really nice and
sharp and make the shape right so this
is what I'm going to do right now
it's time for the fun part you just made
your triangle and you made it the way
you want with like the white and the
black and the gray and I'm gonna take a
makeup suno's cream eyeliner in black
and that is going to be our base to put
the glitters on I'm just gonna take some
random glitters and I just love and that
just look like the outer space when they
are applied to a black color so the
colors I'm going to use so the glitters
I'm gonna use our makeup studio jewel
effects and sparkle this is the most
amazing sparkly glitter ever so I'm just
gonna take two three D glitters these
are amazing we have the big brother so
like the big glass glitters and we have
two small ones in 3d black then I'm
gonna take this makeup studio eye shadow
in black reflex then to play with some
colors in this outer space triangle I'm
gonna take pure pigment instead ik from
Illamasqua before I do that I'm gonna
set this entire triangle with just a
matte black and a matte white eyeshadow
I'm gonna take this white and that black
from this makeup studio 18 color palette
with these shadows you can really make
that like transition from the black to
the wire really nice and smooth with the
shadows
the ones you have done that I'm actually
going to apply some highlighting points
to like if you can see it like the arch
of my brow and here on the inner corners
of my eyes just to like bring that shape
of your eye back a bit into this black
space because you still want to see your
eyes
okay so one thing I've highlighted and
set everything with the eye shadow it's
time for the fun thing like I said just
take your creamy eyeliner that one and
just pop all those glitters on top there
isn't any way to do it wrong just pop
them on and play with it and have fun
actually gonna use some - wait I was
about to make it stick so I'm just gonna
pop them on my hand and then just pet
someone to the eye
the world is a little happier place with
all this equality and it's gonna take
some black eyeliner and pop that onto
the waterline okay what I'm not gonna do
is take some foundation and just apply
it to the skin that hasn't got the
triangle on it also on the other side
I'm gonna apply some false eyelashes
I will tell right after what I use
because I'm not sure yet what I'm gonna
use um so I'm gonna apply lashes do for
nation do some contouring and then I
will be back I apply makeup studio
lashes number one they look like that
and some concealer to my lips to
completely blank them out so on let's
say if you're going to a lady Gaga
concert you can do both eyes or you can
do just one eye like this and then the
other eye like really simple with some
eyeliner and a lot of lashes but that
completes this Lady Gaga Gio 80 inspired
look the goat looked inspired so yeah
looks like that with all the sparkles
from the universe she's in a
government-owned alien territory in
space question of the video what is your
favorite Lady Gaga song let me know in
the comments below and I will see you
guys in my next tutorial but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
