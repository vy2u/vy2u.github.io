a fugitive objective to birth a new
operation
kill the bitch
hey guys so today I'm going to do a
tutorial inspired by Lady Gaga's faint
perfume commercial I absolutely love the
perfume I have a right hair weight I
absolutely love to perfume and the
concert was amazing I went to the Born
This Way Ball with the PR team of the
perfume and as soon as I saw the
commercial for Fame I felt in love she
just looks like an alien
esque sort of chic high fashion model I
love Gaga sort of alien look so today
I'm gonna do sort of her alien look from
the video where she's just scratching
cover of this models face and I'm like
yes I wanted to I want caviar from his
face as well
without any further ado if you want to
know how to get this Gaga alien-esque
sort of look and please keep on watching
ok so before we start I want to tell you
guys that I put my microphone on a
different place um so I'm not sure if
this is gonna work but if it works it's
gonna be like this the entire time and
if it's not working you will probably
hear some weird sounds this video but ah
anyway the first thing you want to do is
get rid of your eyebrows we're going to
fake bleach them so I made an entire
video on this on how to fake bleach your
brows um the link is below in the info
box and um you can click right here what
I'm going to use for this is a Kryolan
aqua color in the sort of hair color
that you have just make sure it's really
really light and close to your skintone
and to activate this I'm going to use my
mac fix+ and then just brush that
through your brows and fake bleach them
okay so once you bleach your eyebrows is
time to use a base for your eyelids the
one I'm using is my Mac soft ochre Paint
Pot in soft ochre for my lid I'm going
to use this pigment by Mac called sweet
Sienna okay now I'm going to take my
fees our eyeshadow pellet in number one
and I'm going to take this gray color
and this sort of mozi purple color and
with the tool I'm going to start
defining my outer V and my crease we're
going to go all the way in with this
crease because Gotha is really known for
that
I'm going to blend this out using
copperplate by Mac and just a little bit
of this color right here and the white
from my face art eyeshadow palette in
number one you just want to go up with
this you really go into your nose line
because this is another thing that Gaga
is really really well known for she
really emphasizes her nose line and of
course blend the rest of the crease as
well
I'm going to darken on that crease using
max a shadowy lady
so with shadowy lady I'm just going to
define the entire crease even more and
then as I go I blend it out as well
now going back with sweet sienna and
filling up any gaps on my eyelid after
the middle of my living on the uses like
color from this Maybelline eye studio
smokey eyes palette quad uh-huh and just
put that on to the middle of your lid
okay so now it's time to really really
blend out that crease just take your
crease colors and just blend it until it
looks gaga
now it's surfer eyeliner and for that
I'm going to use a mixture between my
Mac's
pen ultimate liner in rapid black and a
little bit of my Mac black track fluid
line or the eye liner what you want to
do is make a wing and then go all the
way in and extend it at your inner
corner for a more cat eye effect
starting with my wing then go in fill it
up and go on oh god that sounds so wrong
okay so this is sort of the wing you
want to make and then that inner point
drag it out okay then with a cream
colored eye shadow I'm just gonna
highlight that part right next to it to
make it a little bit more clean for my
waterline I will be using my Ben Nye
neutralizer cream crayon in red
concealer number one mp3 fur mascara I'm
just gonna use the usual I'm gonna use
my makeup studio whatever 3d extra black
and my ultimate curl and then you're
done with your eyes okay so four it
takes to contour I'm going to use my NYX
I can't open it I'm going to use my NYX
blush in taupe and I'm gonna make it a
little bit more extreme by using that
MOSI purple color that we used in a
crease well if I can't find a brush also
a little bit around your temples and
then you were too crazy highlight your
face because she looked so alien-esque
in this same commercial and I love the
shine that was on her face so I already
have it on right here I placed my
highlighter which is my Mac lightscapade
mineralized skinfinish I placed it right
here right here above my brow and right
down my nose and just under my
eyes at the highest point of my face and
then sort of in a diagonal line don't be
gentle with this just slap it on and
also a bit here above my brow and then
blend it up oh and a Cupid's bow of
course and then you have a really
gorgeous sort of alien-esque shine on
your face which I absolutely love okay
for my lips I'm going to use my Mac lip
mix in black Oh black lips I'm so
excited
oh yes hahaha okay now just make your
lips black
so just keep going maker lifts black so
yeah guys say completes my dog a faint
perfume inspired commercial tutorial I
