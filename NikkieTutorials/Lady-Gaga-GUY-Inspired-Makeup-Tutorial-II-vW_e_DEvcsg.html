installment of Lady Gaga week
GUI week here on my channel so in my
last Gaga tutorial lots and lots of you
wanted to see the natural look sort of
the fun springy natural look in front of
the flower wall and I absolutely love
that look on Gaga she's been rocking it
a couple of times now to like events and
to like TV interviews and when I saw
that look in the music video I was like
okay I'm gonna do the extreme cotton
half one and if people want to see the
natural one I'm definitely going to do
that one so here I am doing it for you
and one thing I totally forgot to say in
my previous intro for the guy tutorial
was oh my god the housewives Oh oh my
god they included my favorite show in
like a music video so yeah if you want
to know how to get this a really nice
glowy natural look then please keep
watching so as always I already applied
a base and I use my Mac soft ochre Paint
Pot for that and because the skin is
gonna have quite a warm and bronzed up
feeling I also want to give that feeling
to my eyes so what we're gonna do is I'm
gonna go to the back now I'm gonna take
LM s cos blush in disobey and a bronzing
brush a blush brush ain't just want to
grab a little tiny bit and then work
most of it on the back of your hand and
then what you want to do is just close
your eye and kind of wiggle the brush
around wiggle it in your crease as if
you're using the biggest blending brush
in your life and wiggle it onto your eye
and into your crease now you want to
sculpt out your crease a little bit more
and for that I'll be using this
sculpting powder by Mac cult sculpt and
then also from the Too Faced natural eye
palette I'll be taking this color right
here and this is Velvet Revolver and you
want to start shading this on the outer
part of your crease and mainly keep it
there as well so just keep applying
bit-by-bit and build some definition in
there and then once most of the products
is on your lids already kind of take it
to the inner crease as well highlight
the eye is a necessity for this look and
further we'll be taking this Mac shaping
powder in emphasized and what does some
first gonna hit my brow bone first just
kind of pack it on underneath the
highest point of your arch and then kind
of blend it out and then with this you
also really want to pack it on the inner
corners and open up your eyes with this
and blend that out as well so going back
in with a Zelda revolver and that taupe
blush by Mac there for the lid I'm going
back into this Too Faced natural eye
palette and I'm taking this color right
here and that is called silk teddy and
lightly apply this over the inner part
of your lid to like half of your lid and
because I feel like that is a little bit
too stark compared to Gaga's look I'm
gonna go back into that taupe blush by
Mac and kind of dusted over the silk
teddy color to kind of tone it down a
bit and just make it a little bit more
natural then I'm also going in nude
beach just a tiny bit with my finger and
also tap this on top for some glitter
for the bottom lid I'm going to take
that combination of Zelda revolver and
taupe again and you mainly want to focus
this on the outer sort of third of the
lower lash line and are sticking with
that same color combo I'm going to give
some definition to the outer part of my
eye here more of the outer V and that
will really make this look it will
really give a definition and it just
makes it pop and look nice basically and
then with Velvet Revolver only I'm also
going to brush that along the roots of
my lash line just to ground the look a
little bit more now chakra take that big
Brush where you put your bronzer with on
as well take that again Wow take that
again and then just kind of do the first
step again
and this will really bring back that
warmth and give it all a nice fuzzy
blended feeling I'm highlighting my
inner corners using my the bomb
overshadow pigment in no money no honey
and definitely do not be careful with
this you really want that inner corner
of your eyes to glow and especially once
we glow up the skin it will really tie
in with each other and it will just look
awesome
on the waterline I'm applying some Ben
Nye neutralizer cream crayon in light no
ultra light ultra light and now we of
course want to do is curl your lashes
using your favorite eyelash curlers mine
are by Shu amaura and then for mascara
you definitely do want to apply some
mascara but don't go overboard with it
what I saw on Lady Gaga was that mainly
the roots of her lashes were really
thick and luscious and coated and the
tips of the lashes weren't touched at
all so you really get that definition
from applying it to the roots of your
lashes but you don't get that sort of
length and I really like that so um I
mainly kept it at the roots of my lashes
and wiggled it up a little bit but not
too much for that I'll be using my
makeup studio waterproof 3d extra black
mascara and to really sort of reach the
roots of my lashes I'll be taking the
Mac extended play gigablack black get
gigablack flesh I always get a tongue
twister with this one onto one of the
most important factors into making this
look of success is the skin and the
cheeks okay so just let me fill you in
quickly on is for my base I started
moisturizing with my Mac prep and prime
natural radiance stuff in radiant pink
for my foundation I went for my L'Oreal
True Match in soft ivory
I then concealed my dark circles and
highlighted my skin using my Pro
Longwear concealer by Mac in NC 15 and
to set it ah I used my hourglass ambient
lighting powder in diffused light and in
ethereal light okay so onto the cheeks
what you want to do is first contour a
little bit where you need it you don't
have to do
this I personally do have to do this
because I look like crap without my
contour on so for that I'll be taking my
illamasqua eyeshadow in heroine and I've
gotten a lot of requests on how I
contour and highlight so I will probably
film that in the near future okay so
once you've done that it's time to
bronze it up and really give your face
that it sort of luminous bronzy bronze
Ness so far isn't going to make a
mixture with my bourgeois bronzer and
this is the bronzing powder to stare
normal one and of course it could be
missed my Illamasqua blush in disobeyed
what I'm going to do is mix the powders
and whatever is in the brush I'm going
to wipe on the back of my hand and then
really lightly from your contour you
want to dust it up using circular
motions and I'm barely touching my skin
you really want this to be as light as a
feather touching your skin and sort of
just from your contour go up until sort
of like this part of your face and then
also kind of use it as a blush a little
bit then also a neat trick is to wear
your arches so your brows and then your
arch above your arch kind of dusted as
well and this will give a really nice
sort of warmth to the face without being
too fake and again this is as light as a
feather touching my skin and then what I
like to do is sort of dash it onto my
chin a little bit and under my lip to
kind of tie that in as well and that is
how you can get that really nice sort of
Gaga bronze that she's wearing in that
scene and it's just naturally bronzing
up your face without going overboard for
blush you just want to add a little tiny
touch of pink because the main pink sort
of focus in her look was on her lips so
I'm going to take my Tarte Amazonian
clay blush in a dull face and kind of
mix it into the cheek right here just a
tiny tiny bit nothing too drastic but
for highlighting this is my favorite
part because Gaga was the
in GUI and I absolutely loved it so for
that I'll be taking my vanilla pigment
by Mac and then on top of that I also
did this in my previous GUI tutorial I'm
gonna make it wet and damp be using my
Becca shimmering skin perfecter
so first taking vanilla and let's get
highlighting and tap tap tap tap it free
lips you want to go for a really nice
sort of natural pinky stain with a gloss
on top for this I'll be taking my revlon
colorburst matte balm in unapologetic
and then quickly I'm just going in with
a little pencil to give my top lip a
little bit more body and shape and as a
gloss I'll be using this ISA ah a gloss
veloute in 202 and that guy's completes
this Lady gaga
