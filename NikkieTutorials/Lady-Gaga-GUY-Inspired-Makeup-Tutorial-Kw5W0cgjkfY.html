tutorial son dafuq cut lay back and
feast while this audio guides you
through new and exciting makeup brushes
welcome to Lady Gaga week on
nikkietutorials this week will be Lady
gaga only today I'll be doing a tutorial
for Lady Gaga's new music video called
GUI girl under you and there was one
look in particular that I've been like
falling in love with and that does this
look right here it's the eyeliner um
that sort of cut in half and it's the
same eyeliner that she's wearing with
like the the Vegas outfit at the pool
but it's also the look that she's
wearing um with the guy on the sort of
in the water just you know
chillin chillin with the guy up thinkin
for her life on Friday my sort of last
upload day of the week every week is
another GUI look and I want you guys to
tell me what the next tutorial should be
on so let me know in the comment section
down below which other look of Lady
Gaga's new music video called GOI you
want to see in a tutorial on Friday yeah
if you want to know how to get this a
really cool graphic eyeliner look then
please keep on watching so I already
applied my base using my Mac soft ochre
Paint Pot and to give my crease just the
slightest bit of definition I'm taking
my Illamasqua eyeshadow in heroine and
this is the mech sculpt powder in bone
beige and just really lightly I'm
bringing in the slightest bit of warmth
and definition in my crease using those
two colors I'm going to highlight using
Mac's emphasize and I'm first applying
this underneath the highest point of my
brow bone and then slightly blend it out
then I also put some on my inner corner
because you really want that inner
corner to be light and opening because
eyeliner is quite closing the eyes off
and then just take a little bit and dust
it over the lid but because you don't
want that highlighting color to be too
stark and too light on the lid I'm gonna
go back in bone
beige that sculpt powder by Mac and I'm
just gonna take a little bit of that and
dusted overemphasize and this will make
it a really nice shimmering nude color
it's time for the eyeliner what I'm
going to use for my liner is my
Illamasqua precision gel liner in black
and what you want to do is you want to
start making a normal eyeliner line like
you normally would and instead of making
a really high wing up I'm gonna go
straight out I know that Lady Gaga's
look went down um I couldn't do that
I tried it I tried going down with my
line and I just felt wrong because for
me eyeliner is supposed to lift and it's
supposed to go up and really sort of
like lift a face up and they went down
with the eyeliner and for me that really
made it droopy so I kind of went in
between so instead of lifting or the
drooping I went straight out so this is
what I'll be doing for this video so you
want to make a line straight out then
cut the lid in half so cut it in half
sort of make this shape a thing and then
fill it in and that's basically it
I'm going to start making a normal line
first okay now I'm going to make this
shape for these sort of wing and I'm
going to follow my lower lash line for
that
okay now you want to kind of map out
where you want to cut it a little bit
more to the center
now match that beginning liner to that
line I'm going to go a little bit
further into my crease because I have
kind of hooded eyes and now from that
highest point they're kind of match it
to that point there okay now you want to
fill that entire space in
so after that's fielding you can really
take a look on where you need to sort of
make it a little bit thicker and where
you need to sort of make it a little bit
more less thick and where you really
need to perfect it so go ahead take your
time for this and look as much from the
left to the right um if they match or
not because you definitely do want both
sides to match so go ahead and do that
now take your favorite map like
eyeshadow and mine is from the tard be
magnificent eye and cheek palette and
with this you want to set the black gel
liner because it went all the way over
the crease and it will crease throughout
the day if you're wearing this to a
party or like a I don't know what to
like a concert okay what I'm not gonna
do its curl my lashes and apply some
mascara and I'm using the extended play
gigablack lash mascara for that ever
lashes I'm using my same 36 lashes by
Mac which are my favorite so for the
cheats what you want to do is give
yourself a little bit of contouring and
a little bit of warmth and that's it and
then we go on to the excessive amounts
of shine which are divine and oh so
pretty
I wanted it to rhyme didn't work so
first I'm gonna contour using my heroine
I shadow by Illamasqua
after that you want to take the
slightest bit of bone beige again the
same color we used in the crease and
with that kind of warm up that contour a
little bit right here on the tops of the
cheekbones and now it's time for the
amazing shine that she was rocking in
this music video first thing I'm gonna
do is highlight my entire foot well not
everything but like most of the highest
points of my face with my vanilla
pigment by Mac and then because her
highlight definitely was wet I'm gonna
make it wet as well so kind of make it a
little bit damp E and for that this is a
new love I've been loving this like
crazy you will hear about
more in my March hits and God knows but
for that I'm going to use my Becca
shimmering skin perfecter in pearl so
with vanilla BAM I mean come on
and then I'm also with vanilla going to
put that a little bit under my eye here
really you really want to glow then with
vanilla as well this part from the
beginning of your brows to like the arch
this part right here you want to
highlight their going up onto your
forehead Cupid's bow chin tip of the
nose and just while you're at it do the
rest of your just oh oh my god I look
like horses I mean if you move it looks
like made of plastic I'm gonna go
straight into the Becca shimmering skin
perfecter and pearl and then take just a
tiniest bit you don't need a lot at all
and tap that on top of where you placed
the Noah
I'm just tap tap tap and work work work
oh my god look at that oh I mean come on
I mean Oh for lives Gaga wasn't really
wearing anything it was just her natural
color was just like the tiniest bit of
light bomb on top of it just to keep the
rest of the face really natural um I
cannot use my natural lips because
they're red as hell so I'm going to go
for a nice new lip you can do whatever
you want for the lips so first I'm gonna
line and make them a little bit fuller
using my Bobbi Brown pale pink lip liner
and then on top we're going to apply a
little bit of hourglass a femme nude
lipstick in nude number one and then
just a tiniest bit of gloss is going to
be from Melanie Mills and this is the
lip radiance in pop my cork
