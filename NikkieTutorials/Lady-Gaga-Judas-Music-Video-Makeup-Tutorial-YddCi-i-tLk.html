Gaga's new music video - does the first
time I saw Judas I didn't get it I just
didn't get it at all I just really
didn't get it until someone on Twitter
told me that it was about Mary Magdalene
I probably killed that Mary Jesus Mary
that Mary she is a couple with Jesus but
she's in love with judas and then Jesus
tells Mary to kill Judas but you can do
it and then the red lipstick pops out of
the gun which is one of my favorite
scenes and then uh Judas is like what
the I'm done with you I'm gonna
kill you so then the entire village
decides to kill her so today I decided
to do a look on the scene with the gun
and in the tub it was basically the same
makeup just a thing with the gun you
could see you're up close and in the tub
you couldn't really wish it was water
also I want you guys to check out Gaga
true news on Twitter I will put the
letters right here they are amazing they
are so sweet every time I came out with
the new Lady Gaga video day tweeted
about it and that is so sweet so I'm
giving back the love please check out
that Twitter and maybe follow them I
also have twitter which is
nikkietutorials just some Twitter enough
of the blogging if you want to know how
this this Lady Gaga look on Judas
then please keep on watching so the
first thing I'm going to do is apply
base to my eyelids do you prevent the
eyeshadow or actually the eyeliner from
creasing and I'm using my BH Cosmetics
eyelid primer so as you probably can see
I made my brows a lot darker than my
hair color because that is what Lady
Gaga does a lot and she also had like
these broza went out and then they had
another line I'm not gonna
do that because I just don't like how
that looks on me um but because they
were so dark I apply the concealer under
it to make them really nice and like so
that instantly gave me a brow bone
highlight if you are not doing this riff
your brows and you're not applying the
lighter concealer on your brow bone then
just go ahead and get a like a highlight
for your brow bone so the basic thing of
this is a PI your brow bone highlight
and I already did mine so after your
brow bone highlight you're going to get
your face powder and mine is Mac Studio
care blend powdery light and with the
face butter I'm just gonna set the
primer that we put on and then because
the powder it like takes away all the
like contouring and the shapes of your
eye I'm gonna go and bring back that
like nose line and the crease Thomas NYX
blush in taupe this with the big
blending brush I'm just going to put
some shadow back into my eye and
remember that Lady Gaga trick go all the
way to the bridge of your nose and blend
it with your crease and then also blend
it into your crease okay now it's time
for the eyeliner it's actually really
really easy
I'm gonna use my neck like check fluid
line this 266 brush from Mac this
stargazer eyeliner brush in number 10
and also you're gonna need some black
eye shadow which for me is carbon and
like us like square brush like that okay
so all you want to do is start up by
doing your basic cat eyeliner just go a
little bit more straight out normally
you will go a little bit up
now you go smore straight out then from
that point that point from the eyeliner
go all the way in that is the first
thing I'm gonna do
okay and now I'm going to take that
square brush like that and set it with
black eyeshadow okay that for that lower
lashline is really easy remember my
Ke$ha video where I did the we are where
we are and I did that trick to make the
eyes look bigger to not follow entirely
the like waterline would go a little bit
out that's what you want to do with the
eyeliner as well like that like that
that is the line you want to do and then
you just want to go to your lash line
and connect it to your eye and then once
you come out you kind of want to do the
same as with it right there and then
wing it out like that once you reach
like the point right here you want to go
out
now with the matte black eyeshadow again
I'm just gonna smoke some of that
eyeshadow under the lines it's giving
more of a smoky eye effect then for the
last part of the eyeliner just take the
same stargazer brush and you want to
follow the direction that that line is
going down so as you can see I just went
down with that line it's a once you've
done that you can apply some mascara I'm
going to use my makeup studio maximum
volume and Maybelline the colossal and
then I will be back for the lid okay for
the lift she actually had a like a lip
color I've never seen before it was dark
red it was brownish it had a gold Sheen
to it it looked really ancient ancient
Ange ancient so to recreate that lip I'm
going to make the corners or like the
outer edges of my mouth dark with NYX
very berry lipstick then the inside and
blended a bit with the February I'm
gonna use a black cherry from neck NYX
if we're that special sheen like that
Sheen that makes it so unique I'm going
to use Mac's Sun no fun bathing and this
actually has the light gold Sheen I'm
talking about I'm going to use that as a
top coat so I applied very very
undoubted corners of my mouth and on my
lower like line and rotor I'm going to
take black cherry which is a brighter
red and I'm applying that all over and
blend it with the darker color and then
take the fun bathing and apply that on
top
now let's take some toilet paper and
blot your lips and then go over with fun
bathing again so I absolutely adore this
she has been wearing this look a lot
lately with just really bold eyeliner
and almost black lips it's just really
goth lips I'm sorry I tried to mix my
hair to her and yeah so that completes
this Judis inspired tutorial if you have
