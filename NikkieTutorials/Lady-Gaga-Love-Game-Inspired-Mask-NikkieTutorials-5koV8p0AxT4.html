look I already did a tutorial on this
eye but when I did this I took it a
couple of steps further and I made this
god I love games fired masks if you want
to know how I did this
please keep on watching and things
okay so what we're gonna do right now is
take this neutral yet colorful look into
a Gaga love game and fired look so if
you want to know how I've got this then
please check out the link in the sidebar
I'm also going to put that video where I
get this as a video response to this
video and I'm going to put this video
that we're making right now as a
response to that video so you can just
find it I'm gonna be inspired by this
teen where she's like laying Nikki with
the two guys and all the diamonds and
the purple and the blue and the blue
though I'm gonna try to recreate it I'm
donating me to turn out ugly just gonna
do something with it
the first thing I'm gonna do is apply a
blue color for my on my temples I'm
gonna get a blue sky by Glen Couture and
I'm using a sigma 188 just taking a bit
and then just Dipple that and blend that
onto the temples
I'm just blending that in and make it
look really um cloudy just like a cloud
like really blend it and at one point
it's really blue but and it turns out
into this soft motion thing try to get
that now I'm gonna write that 188 off on
my towel and I'm going to take stars
makeup Haven refill in Pandora so I'm
gonna um get Pandora Mike I don't want
to see the movie again and this is going
to be on the edges of that blue so do
that so just blend that around the blue
around see blending that around you can
even go into the blue if you like doing
that too now I'm going to take stars and
rockets by Mac with that 188 and this is
going between the Pandora and the blue
so between the two cards we just placed
and here as well for a nice cheek color
and on my brow bone as well if it works
which it doesn't that well now how to
take blue sky again and intensify that a
bit more and one more with the purple
well so I just went downstairs because
there was a call for me and I looked
into the mirror and in normal light this
is really glowy it glows the hell out of
your skin and it just looks really
pretty so I'm just blending that blue
sky a little bit more into my skin and
I'm taking more of that stars and
records and applying it around it here
under breath and then I'm taking some
more Pandora and applying that
everywhere I won and then I took aquifer
my Mac and apply that right here on my
temples or on my cheekbones as a
highlight and around here as well I'm
not sure if I want to keep on like this
but right now I'm going to do the other
side so I'm going to apply blue sky
around here and I'm gonna be like this
it's going to meet this part it's going
to be the more up and this part is going
to be more down somebody's blue sky and
I'm gonna use stars and rockets and the
Pandora in my palette Pandora and
aquifer it and then we're gonna see
what's gonna do more than just look so
be right back okay
so is my face and no time for crystals
and rhinestones and craziness so I'm
taking a whole lot of silver one because
she mainly is wearing silver but I want
to add some dark blue ones as well just
for fun I'm gonna take some a duo glue
and a right and the tweezer men to put
them on so I'm gonna put some glue on my
table my mine on my table and then I can
just like I put a drop of glue on this
is the table the table and then I'm
gonna drop another one and then take a
resin and get it in that's what I'm
doing right now so let's take a silver
one
and what does that always happen to me
yeah don't be a bitch I'm so not good in
this right you suck at this take a blue
one a dark blue one
a dark blue oh this is not fun like this
two-bit say just don't want to look
cheap I'm gonna look rich just like Lady
Gaga's right now rich like that I'm just
gonna keep it like that because they are
care driving me inciting to take a
klaris glitter and silver hair yeah and
I'm gonna touch them to wash glue with a
brush put that in between the sides now
I'm gonna put some silver glitter in
between them just for fun I'm so I'm
prepared for this as you might have seen
already
