inspired by the new Gaga telephone video
featuring Beyonce of course she's so
gorgeous in the video as well first of
all I have been waiting for this video
for weeks
/ months I am in love with this music
video oh my god Gaga and beyoncé you
killed everyone
so of course YouTube makeup community
war is going to start right now everyone
is gonna make a gaga inspired video
right now everyone is doing their best
to come up with a look as quick as
possible so the war of the Gaga inspired
looks is officially begun and I am in
that war absolutely as well because I
cannot miss out on this today I was
inspired by the crime scene
investigation scene where she has the
crime scene investigation thing on their
body I love it and I was like I need to
do a look inspired by it so it's not
recreated it's not what she is wearing
in the music video this is inspired by
the colors inspired by Gaga inspired by
her lips so that is what I did today I
hope you liked it if you have any
questions at the end of this video leave
them in the comment section below
everything when I use is in the sidebar
follow me on Twitter because a lot of
Twitter and hair extensions are from
foxy locks link is in the sidebar and I
really want to thank you for watching we
passed 20 1000 subscribers which is
insane I mean hello I've been sick the
last week and I'm still sick so I hope
you don't mind my voice and please enjoy
this Gaga video thank you so much for
watching bye
okay so I totally forgot I have to
record the first step but I already
applied my base and I already took max
vanilla with a 239 by Sigma I'm just
having that all over my lid and here my
tear duct as well now I'm going to take
a Clarence eyeshadow in number 26 it's
called dusty rose and I'm taking a sigma
224 like that and I'm just sweeping it
in and this is going above the crease
you don't want to go in the crease
because we won um bigger looking eyes so
I just go above that crease in here at
the nose bridge as well and then wing it
out so you just want to take that
channel and wing it outwards that and
then just go further in that crease
those are my highlight my brow bone with
I'm a 275 my Sigma and vanilla by Mac
again this is going on my brow bone so
and what you want to do with the 275
right now is make that line of the brown
really sharp and make this go outward
it's also sorry I'm sick so I've no idea
what I'm talking about but you just want
to take that vanilla and make that line
really sharp and make that vanilla go
out as well right here now time for
eyeliner through the entire video
Beyonce and Lady Gaga have beautiful cat
eyes so I'm definitely gonna do that
right now like that I'm going to use a
Rimmel London's glam eyes liquid liner
so I hope you come along with me
I always start in the middle like that
then I go in
like that I drew country and then the
hardest part is to get this even so then
I go a little bit out
just keeping it really close to the lash
line that's close as possible and then
I'm gonna make the wing which is pretty
damn hard dad that's a wing then we're
gonna take it in like that that you have
a gap and then fill that in now my other
one is away dramatic so I'm gonna
make it more dramatic oh no let me take
a q-tip and whip that with my tongue
we can go up I love q-tips and cat eyes
we could go up the straight line and
then clean it up a bit and now you have
the perfect guideline now you just have
to make that line bigger on your lid so
now you have to perfect you know like
shape that it goes up and just like here
you want to make it really thick
so now that you have that line you're
basically done in the upper lid
I'm never gonna work on all this
craziness so the first thing I did was I
took a really really really really
really sharp slanted eyeliner brush and
I'm gonna take any matte black eyeshadow
I own and what I'm gonna do is make like
a second line parallel with that upper
line so this line should be parallel to
that line so that's what we gonna draw
I'm just gonna do it and just watch how
I do it and if you have any questions
just leave them in the comment section
below
first as much some black shadow under my
lid and then I'm gonna meet the other
lon
and then just like the upper lid bring
it back in then I like to take a little
little smudger brush or a pencil brush
and make that a little bit darker along
my lower lash line I'm gonna take my
eggs jumbo pencil in milk and highlight
my inner corners and then I'm gonna take
a vanilla with a 275 and pop that right
on top and then to make that even more
out there I'm gonna take gesso my mic
which is in this pallet gesso Oh matte
white color pop that over on top and
here what's that lower line is with
shadows it's a little bit less intense
so now I'm going over it with that
liquid liner to make it more intense
that's not gonna craziness so we're
gonna do the yellow part the crime scene
investigation line inspired
I'm gonna take my 120 palette and I'm
gonna take that yellow save one two
three used to be like thud what's that
yellow and with a 224 by Sigma I'm just
gonna smudge that under that line so I'm
gonna take some I'm just gonna put it on
there and you want to follow that line
so go all the way to here all the way
like that and then just blended two
around here really easy so just blend it
along
now to give it a little bit more
intensity and dimension I'm gonna mix
the orange right next to it the orange
and the yellow I'm gonna mix the two
together and blend this along here just
to make it a little bit more dimensional
Wow I'm gonna use glitter I love glitter
I'm gonna take I'm obsessive compulsive
cosmetics OCC gold glitter I'm not gonna
use lash glue or lip glosses because
that will make it stick to certain
places I just want it to be like a fairy
like everywhere so I'm just gonna dip my
ring finger in it I'm gonna just spread
it all over the yellow under the line so
you don't want to go all the way down
you really want it to be more up so now
we're going to use some mascara the max
volume flash by Rimmel I'm not gonna get
false lashes just because I don't want
to ruin this look because I just suck
with false lashes so if I apply them I
might ruin the look which I don't want
to do and then I'm gonna show you how to
get the dark Gaga lips I'll be right
back so what I'm gonna do is take this
Rimmel London what a proof I define our
guest eyeliner in on stable 211 stable
line my lips fill them in and then I
will be back with the gloss and all that
stuff so be right back so after I filled
in the entire lip with the eye pencil I
went over it with a lipstick by Rimmel
London this is number 70 our number 750
coffee shimmer so that completes this
gaga
crime scene investigation scene from
telephone look um I hope you like it
this is so different but so Gaga I love
gaga
gonna put online but gloves are know
some even more Gaga but thank you guys
so much for watching I love you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
