this Lady Gaga the countess American
Horror Story hotel look wait I lost my
track there today I'm doing a tutorial
on Lady Gaga from American Horror Story
hotel the part where she eats someone
out literally I am loving American
Horror Story hotel it is so good and I
think Lady Gaga is killing it so I
decided to make this video sort of an
homage I have you loved her as well we
watch it together here's like see ya
without any further ado if you would
like to know how to get this bloody mess
on your face then keep on watching
alright so the first thing we're gonna
do is Kate Gaga's new vampire but if you
ask me she's never looked better her
skin has never looked better and more
glowy so I don't know what's going on
with the entire virus but her skin is
looking good so to make my makeup stay
on all night
the first thing I'm applying is my
Maivia men aftershave balm insensitive
and this has glycerin as its second most
used ingredient and that means that it
will stick all night because whatever
goes on to glycerin really sticks and
slaves so this is really going to make
sure that your makeup lasts all night
I'm following through using some
Smashbox photo finish primer water now
coming back to that glow I was talking
about
I want to go very luminous and beautiful
and flawless with my base I'm going in
with my Cogan doe aqua foundation
illuminator in number one this is just a
white sheering goodness and I'm gonna
apply this all over my face for that
dude looks crazy now will get better in
the end trust me not only does this make
me look more pale it's also great to mix
in with foundations to make them a
little bit more lighter for foundation
today I'm going to go with the lightest
one I own and that is the Maybelline fit
me matte + poreless in one tan and
adding a little bit more of that co can
go illuminator in what
and I'm applying this using a Beauty
Blender mmm
pill and perfected honey for concealer
I'm going to use the Kevyn Aucoin
sensual skin enhancer in the number oh
gosh
SX a1 and it's the lightest color they
have I want to go for that extra
flawless look cuz literally gog out
looked flawless like I don't know what
she's been doing a dr. Simon's office
cuz I've been there
he told me all about Lady gaga I'm
eating her in real life don't know what
she got done there but girl you look
great and again blending that in with my
Beauty Blender
and now quickly setting it with powder
to prevent it from creasing okay now
it's time to do the bleach brows and of
course it's just Halloween we are not in
the mood to completely like for real
bleach or brows so there's a method that
you can do it the fake way and that is
by just brushing some bleached color
into the brows like a water activated
paint concealer foundation and then if
you brush that through your hairs with a
spoolie it will give you that fake
bleached brow look so I'm going to make
a mixture between this Kryolan aqua
color in ivory and a little bit of white
to make it that much more lighter okay
perfect now I'm going to powder my skin
using this velvet finished powder by
Make Up For Ever in 25 it has a little
bit of a green tinge to it and that will
further take out any color I may have in
my skin so the first thing I want to do
for eyes is primum because you want this
to stay on all day and for this I'm
using my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot from
the lorac mega pro 2 palette I'm taking
this color right here called bisque and
I'm using this to set my eyeshadow foam
crease to brow bone so we're not
touching the lid with this just from the
crease to the brow bone on the lid I'll
be applying some Prosecco just I look
you guys is so easy you'll laugh at me
for it being so easy now the main
difference is Gaga's eyes are big like
these big almond shaped eyes
I have small hooded eyes so this right
here this trick I did right here it
looks phenomenal on gaagaa because it
just falls into that crease and it just
it just falls into it and looks stunning
and with my eyes you're like what the
hell is that line doing there but
hiccough is fun and it doesn't always
have to look like it does on someone
else but we're still doing it I'm
highlighting my inner corners using this
buxom diamond darling eyes shadow and
now it's time to do the eyeliner I'm
first going to map it out using a dark
brown it's actually saddle from the mega
pro 2 palette I'm just going to sketch
out the liner with that but basically I
want to do is you want to make it come
from the lower lash line up till here go
back into the lash line and stop about
halfway in fill in with black and you're
dead so first that definition on the
lower lash line but halfway in
and then drag it back towards the
lashline and all you want to do is fill
it in with black okay now it's time for
the last eyes shadow portion which is
that little cut crease thingy right here
this will give the look a little bit
more depth and definition plus if you
have those gorgeous almond eyes it will
just look like it just like it belongs
there so I'll be using two makeup geek
eyeshadows for this
the first one is bedrock and mixing it
with stealth now all you want to do to
finish off is to apply some falsies I
cut the Ardell one Thirteen's in half
and then the inner half is going on the
outer portion of the eyes and then
really lift them up and that will give
you this awesome Gaga cat eye now if you
wanted to do the normal Gaga look and
that would be the time to apply a nice
berry ombre lip color with a love gloss
on it or red or whatever you like but
I'm doing the blood I'm going crazy so
first we're going to go in with face
paint this is passionate red by vis I'm
Pro and it's the extreme color art looks
like this exciting so I'm going to use
this to splatter all over my face and
kind of give myself a base and then over
top we're going to slap some blood on
and then that should be the end of the
look and then with a stippling brush I'm
just going to smear it around my mouth
and you do not want this to be pretty
you want to go all-out with this
some appear goes crazy with this one you
see how this almost looks like a nose
highlight I'm living for it I'm gonna
mix it a tiny bit with some black and
then add that to the center of my lips
to give it a little bit more depth so I
thought and then also adding in a little
bit of makeup geeks cherry cola because
this is the perfect color like a zit in
between color so girl you go crazy with
that color girl and then now let's at
the blood so the blood so where the
blood I'll be using is hi-hi the
stranger I just met the blood I'll be
using is Mir on stage blood and may runs
coagulated blood a mix between the two
should be perfect
I'm going to be messy with this
oh and of course how could I forget she
needs a little bit of glow I'm gonna use
starlight buy on the sauce Everly Hills
she ain't biting nobody without her glow
okay go ahead slap a wig on put your
outfit on and you're done
and that guy's concludes this Lady Gaga
