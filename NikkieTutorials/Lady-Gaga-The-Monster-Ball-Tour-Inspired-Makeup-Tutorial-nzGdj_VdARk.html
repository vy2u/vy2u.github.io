inspired and let me break it down for
you right now for once and for all
cuz I'm monsters inspired to me is
seeing colors seen shapes seeing a look
and I'm going really crazy about it but
I want to do my own twist to it and I
don't really want to recreate it all the
time or when I see colors I'm like whoa
that is so pretty for real look inspired
doesn't mean that Lady Gaga because that
is the look that we're going for today
inspired doesn't mean that Lady Gaga I
have awarded this it doesn't mean that
she ever is going to wear it is it is
just my interpretation of colors shapes
styles that is to me that is inspiration
I mean we've hosting Lady Gaga with a
 Reese once or twice so I tried to
do that today with some pink colors
because she had a lot of pink in the
concert line monsters
watch
those are go with this stargazer angled
brow brush and I'm gonna use it to cut
the crease the first thing is this is
mechs vintage grave and with the angled
brush by stargazer I'm going into the
darkest color of that blush the darkest
color and then just go a tad bit into
and Mark so like one two and then you
want to get the outside like right here
you want to keep it really light and
bright pink and once you go in it goes
darker so when you cut this crease you
want to keep the darkest couple of
darkest colors on your inner corner
and take the bean color and continue
that line and then with that bright pink
color I really love that color so I'm
just gonna bring it out baby bring it
and blend it up and then I like to take
this pencil brush and go in that pink
color and then just flick it out
completely and make it nice and Gaga ish
now it's time to make some colors to get
the perfect color that you want
I'm gonna grab for the darkest part I'm
gonna grab some sugar pale poison plum
with a sugar pill love+ and we're just
gonna dip that into each other and when
you mix those you're getting like this
magenta purple bright color and you're
gonna put this on to the inner corners
and blend it up so you're just gonna
take those colors and blue one goes up
into the crease
now I'm going to take em bark and put
that right under the colors this amber
color is really going to define the line
make it blend into the light pink of
course make a blend to all the other
colors as well what I'm now going to do
is just grab a really small pencil brush
and just take those colors and blend
those in the inner corners and make it
all ended in Nice
um so right now I'm missing my eyeshadow
so right now I'm gonna take the
highlighting eyeshadow I always use and
I'm not gonna let me grab the vanilla
and use that as a brow bone highlight
and with this color I'm gonna blend all
the other colors down and make it one
piece you know not like peace but peace
now you can go back with a small pencil
brush into the poison plum and the love
plus and make it more vibrant again
with the 239 my Mac I'm going back in
vanilla and this is going onto your lid
so that's a pretty upper part very
extreme very garish you can do
everything with the lower lid you can do
to stay within a little roll in and make
a look old freak elastic freak the list
kick I chose to make it really dark and
smudgy and I'm gonna take this 214 my
Sigma and I'm gonna take a max signed
sealed and this is going over my entire
lower lash line so I'm starting in your
inner corner right here and the outer
corner right there I make it all black
and dark just like that in right now
you're like oh so ugly now I'm gonna
take poison plum and that pink are on at
214 and smudge just below the sign seal
so we're right here
weird things I know get used to it so
right now I'm gonna line my waterline
with a jumbo pencil in milk I'm gonna
tightline with bourgeois waterproof
clubbing Black Friday I pencil I'm gonna
use some liquid liner to make that
pointy line I have done some tutorials
where I explain how to do eyeliner and I
will put an annotation right here for
which video that is I'm not
to show it right now so you can check
that out and from scare up my favorite
round favorite one the Rimmel the max
volume flash for lips I took everything
off just to show you that I totally hate
my lip color like this this is my
natural lip color it I absolutely hate
it and I know I'm gonna get comments
like oh you should be proud of the
residents baby stuff I'm gonna use a
couple of things to achieve my lips that
I want for this look so the first thing
I'm going to use it's this a Michael
taught you the face and I use it in so
many videos already and I keep
recommending them to everyone so I'm
just going to apply this to completely
blank out my lips now for this look I
kind of wanted to make the lips a nude
but in the inner corners of my mouth
really bright and dark so I'm going to
start off with this matte cream cheese
lipstick in creme de nude and this is
just a really nude color so I love my
new clips and I can't live without my
new Liz but even this is too lot for me
I think I look ridiculous right now
so don't be afraid I don't like this
either anymore I used to in the past
like I loved it I thought this was the
best new lip ever like no lips at all
but right now even with this book I
think it's too light so now I'm going
over with a little bit of Gaga lipstick
and now I'm going to grab some lime
crime lipstick and look at that
packaging I'm going to do a review on
this soon and this is um this is
centrifuge shot and I'm going to adapt
this on the inner corners of my lip
do that
now I have that which is I think it's
really fun and it still is kinda new but
fit pretty and fun as well I'm now gonna
grab two lip glosses
this is Amex electric few shot and this
is dazzle glass in fun fabulous so again
with this lip glosses and essa glass
apply it to the inner part of your lip
so I'm not going to use the fun tabulous
because I think this is pretty fun as
well so I hope you guys like this
tutorial music it's my voice with a
dream please go check them out they are
so talented and the singer is really
nice and handsome I know she didn't wear
this in any of her music videos or on
her tour but I just wanted to be
inspired by the Lady Gaga and this is
what came out with this so thank you
guys so much for watching I will hope to
see you guys next time again and my body</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
