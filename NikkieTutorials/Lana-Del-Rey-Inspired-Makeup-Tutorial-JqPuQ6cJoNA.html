on Lana Del Rey it's an inspired one and
I am loving Lana's away at the moment I
just got her new album born to die it's
absolutely de bomb I absolutely love
Lana I love her style love her hair
I even love her pumped up lips I do like
them and so yet today I decided to do a
inspired tutorial after I got so many
requests for her so if you want to know
how to get this cat eyeliner and those
full lips and all that jazz then please
keep on watching
so as always the first thing you want to
do is apply a baster eyelids to prevent
the eyeshadow for creasing and the one
I'm using is soft ochre Paint Pot from
Mac and um you just take a bit on your
finger you just put that baby boy on no
rocket science right oh my god that was
ever also on the bottom again afore at
first eyeshadow I'm gonna take max
copper plate and i depotted all my
eyeshadows how to put them all in
palettes i depotted this one too and
look it says copper plate i what I'm
going to do today is I'm going to go a
little bit further up than I normally
would if you look at this eye you see
that I went above my crease so with
copper plate you're just going to build
some shadow of a new fake crease higher
than your natural crease and then I'd
like to give this sort of a kick a
straight point right there then I'm
going to take max mystery and on the
outer corners I'm going to darken it up
a little bit more it's sort of like this
um this 60s eyeliner look a lot of looks
headed back then to you where the
darkest part was at the outer corner out
outer corner oh my god I can't speak
today I'm going to go back into copper
plate with my favorite blending brush
this is the Mac 224 and what I'm going
to do is just make this softer because
right now is way too harsh just to make
it softer just relax on that I just give
it some space you know talk to him give
them a weekend's you huh give it some
time with its friends I am talking
today I hope to got that the lighting of
this video is okay because I tried some
new settings with my new camera and I
just don't know if it's going to work so
bear in mind that if this looks like
crap is because of my new camera
I'm the litigant up I'm max
chamomile i shadow and just with a big
brush I'm going to Pat that on to the
lid and into that inner corner right
there I'm going to do exactly the same
on my bottom line I'm going to take
mystery and copper plate and just pop
those on my lower lash line and really
softly start with copper pipe the set is
a softer color of the two then was
copper plate I'm going to go out a bit
into that crease and then go in the
crease as well for a quick inner corner
highlighting on take mix and nylon and
they're just going to pop that on to the
inner corners of my eye okay now it's
time for the really big cat eye liner
for that i'm using mac's blacktrack
fluid line and the trick with this
eyeliner is to really make it a cat eye
liner take the outer part of your eye
r-really wing it out then from the outer
point you're really going to go down but
the more you go to the inner corner of
your eye you want to make it smaller so
right here I have this really thick line
but as I go to the inner corners of my
eyes it's really really thin and that's
going to give you that like cat look
firs I'm going to make the direction I
want to go to quite high then from your
outer corner of your eye connect it from
that point I'm going to go into eyelid
further I go into my lid I make the line
thinner
now once you have the basic line you're
going to look into your mirror and
you're going to compare it to because of
course you want them to be even now as I
can see is that this one is a lot
thicker right there so what I'm just
going to do is just make this thicker
until it matches okay so that's about as
even as I can get them okay what I'm now
going to do is take a black eye Kohl
this is Urban Decay's 24/7 glide-on eye
pencil and what I'm going to do is tight
line underneath the really big eyeliner
because right now there is skin
peeking through the liner and that is
not what you want so you're going to
lift your lid up and make that black as
well to make everything a seamless black
liner on my bottom waterline I'm just
going to use a nude colored eye pencil
to really open up the eyes and this is
what Lana does a lot in her looks
I'm not going to curl my lashes with
mushy Remora eyelash curler and put some
mascara on and then I'm going to pop
some lashes on it doesn't really matter
which lashes you use and you just want
to go for these really long sort of cat
eye shaped ones the ones I'm using look
like that just some really just a really
long lashes said I will be back for the
lips to make them a little bit fuller
like Lana has 'm
the main thing is to overdraw your lips
really softly and really naturally and
then put a new lipstick on I missed
stone today
I'm going to go on top of the new lip
pencil from Inglot and I'm just going to
blend it in so you don't really want to
see this line anymore it's just going to
be a shadow because right now it looks a
little bit dead because it's really gray
because of the stone lip liner I'm going
to take on Nyx's lipstick in orange soda
which is a nice warm color I'm going to
warm this lip up so yeah guys that
completes this Lana Del Rey inspired
makeup tutorial it's just all of the cat
eyeliner and that little define went in
the crease and just those full lips so
