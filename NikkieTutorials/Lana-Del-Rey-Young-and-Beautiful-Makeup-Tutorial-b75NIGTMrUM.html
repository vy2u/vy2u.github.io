Del Rey young and beautiful inspired
makeup tutorial it's not really inspired
it's more of a recreation I absolutely
love young and beautiful I heard it for
the first time at night literally got
like shivers all over my body and then
the makeup was stunning in a music video
and I love the tears that they did and I
love Lana Del Rey so today I decided to
do her main look from the video and I
really really enjoy it I feel like such
a glam sort of vintage woman I look
nothing like Lana but I'm just having
fun with makeup and if you want to know
how to get this look then please keep on
watching
so the first thing you want to do for
this look is to apply mr. eyelets to
prevent the eyeshadow from creasing and
I'm using my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot
which I got the new one
so no more pan porn because it was
completely empty and this is my new soft
ochre Paint Pot okay so the first thing
I will be doing is making a mixture
between Mac's texture eyeshadow and kid
and this is going to be run run run and
I'll be applying this along my lower
lash line you want the lowest point to
be right in the middle towards your
pupils taking a pencil brush and smoking
this out and making it look soft now
we'll be taking kid eyes shadow only and
in sort of like a round way I'm going to
define my crease a little bit more and
you really want this somewhat to look
like a circle around your eyes because
the shape that lana was rocking in the
video was really rounded and really sort
of like a circle around her crease so
make sure that you don't add an outer V
just go in a circle I'm quickly applying
a brow bone highlight now and this is
exactly my skin color so it will only
Matan down everything
now take a fluffier brush and start
blending that crease out but keeping it
round people so blend it out to kind of
smoke it out but in a round way taking
fully eye shadow by Mac with this I'm
going to darken that outer part of that
crease a little bit more for more
definition and for an even rounder
effect for the lid will be taking OCC's
loose color pigment in twirl and with
Lana's lid in this video it actually she
was wearing a gloss on top of it I'm not
going to do that today because one that
is truly and only for photo shoots for
music videos for like temporarily
wearing a look if you want to wear this
to prom or whatever you can't really add
gloss to your lids because it's on the
crease and it will just not feel the
best so I decided to go for a really
nice neutral shine to the lid and this
trill color by OCC has a really nice
coppery golden
so that is perfect because you can still
see your own skin color peek through but
it has really nice glow to it so I'm
going to add that to my lid to sort of
replace the gloss
I'm gonna highlight my inner corners
using maxiblog type for a touch of
glamour Sparkle I'm going to add this
makeup studio jewel effects and shine to
my inner corners just a teeny tiny bit
not a lot though and literally this is
all I lied I many more and to open up my
eyes on me is my Ben Nye neutralizer
creme crayon in red concealer number one
mp3 to really give myself that wide-eyed
Lana Bambi
hybrid look for eyeliner we'll be using
my Mac fluidline and dip down with this
eyeliner you just want to keep in mind
that you want to keep your entire eye
shape really rounded and we are not
going to add owing
we're actually with the outside we're
just going to feather it out of it and
then blend it with the eyeshadow so this
eyeliner doesn't really have an ending
point it kind of blends into that outer
rounded circle shape
and then with your Foley I shadow again
go on top and blend it out okay so for
mascara I will be using two today and
the first one I'm gonna light is the
waterproof 3d extra black by makeup
studio and then on top is the they're
real by benefit and that lash it's
because Lana Del Rey is like it
resembles lashes lashes and lips got
that clear and the lashes that we'll be
using are miss adoro 747 ms these are my
absolute favorites and I'm gonna do all
of that right now and I already applied
the tear drops um these are the closest
shapes to tear drops I could find I got
this in Germany um a kit with all these
type of rhinestones and these were
included so I put these on okay so
fertilis will be making a mixture
between Mac's rebel lipstick which is a
really dark sort of plummy purple and um
the other part of the mixture is Moxie
by Mac and together
I think these resemble the best sort of
Lanna color from young and beautiful
okay so I think the overall feeling of
this lipstick combination is a little
bit too bright so I'm gonna make it a
little bit more rebel only so from now
on I will take rebel and just go over
and make it a little bit darker so for
the cheeks I actually want to apologize
because I already did them off-camera
for contouring I used my NYX blush in
taupe as I always do when contour in in
contouring and I also contoured my nose
because Lana's contoured her nose as
well but she cut her bones and I
contoured my flesh and the blush that I
used is naked of rose by Illamasqua
really vintage eerily mmmm and for a
highlight I used my trusty old vanilla
pigment by neck which is gorgeous
because I'm shining like a star like I'm
young and beautiful and that ladies and
gentlemen completes my Lana Del Rey
young and beautiful inspired slash tree
