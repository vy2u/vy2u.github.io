see you look I everyone as their mother
saw avatar I I'm sure I think the whole
world saw it actually never wanted to
see avatar I'm worried about talking I
don't know four or five months ago right
now but I never wanted to see it and
then Leona Lewis came out with ICU and
her music video and I was like oh my god
actually Leona Lewis's music video I see
you made me see avatar so Thank You
Leona as if she's ever gonna see it but
okay so like two or four or five months
later I'm finally doing a look that she
wears in the music video I was on
Twitter and I asked what should I do and
I wanted to do a summer bronze look this
is way too much information why I'm
going to telling you this I hope you
guys enjoy thank you guys for watching
and if you want to know how I did this
then please keep on my tank
first thing you want to do is apply a
base and I am going to use my Michael
taught nude eyeshadow cream eyeshadow
this tutorial is all about mixing and
matching colors for the look so I'm
gonna take a sigma 230 I'm gonna take a
Sigma 239 for this look it's all about
matching and mixing colors to get the
right color so for the inner corner I
mix three colors I took a vanilla I took
a white Frost and I took of X as X is a
kind of greeny gray color with a purple
deer crow so I'm gonna start off by
taking vanilla on my brush then i'm
taking white frost on my brush and then
i'm taking a little bit of the effects
on my brush and that is going onto your
inner corners and you keep mixing those
colors into the inner corners and
eventually stop using the sex because
you want the inner corner to be
delighted so right now I'm gonna take
vanilla and white Frost and pop that
into the inner corners into the inner
third of my lid you can take tape for
this next step but I think tape is a
little bit too strong in too harsh for
this look I'm gonna take toilet paper
and that is a toilet toilet paper and
put this under your bottom lashes and
match it with your brow the end of your
brow so I'm gonna put it like that
zoom in a little bit more and then we're
gonna take sketch my Mac signed sealed
and plumage and those you're gonna take
a lot of sketch a little bit of tone of
totally sketch a sign sealed and once
had a fluid
and you're going to blend this on to
your outer corner so I'm just gonna
start right here and then go into crease
blend it into the lid like that and go
into the crease so I'm taking a little
bit more just to get the shape on and
I'm not holding this here for the entire
tutorial I'm just holding it for that
for the shape so right now you can leave
the toilet paper alone and you just have
that shape that you want for your outer
corner so right now I'm going to take
those three colors and blend them out
and blend them into the crease and blend
them into the middle of the lid so
you're just gonna take Sketch fine
sealed and there's a little bit of
plumage and just mix and match this onto
your eye
and eventually wipe your brush up and
just blend it now I'm going to take a
226 5 Sigma and I'm going to take a
dusky rose by Clarence dusty rose and
take that just a little bit on to the
brush and blend is above the color just
really lightly blend it above a pretty
middle of the lid I take effects I don't
know if you can see what I'm gonna zoom
in to try to show you facts it's like
this greenish gray color but it has a
purple duochrome which you can totally
not see on the camera but it really has
a purple jewel crowing and I'm gonna
take my 239 by Sigma again and just pop
that into the middle of the lid and
blend it with the con of with the colors
right here and the color right there now
Freddy brow bone highlight you can see
it coming I'm going to take vanilla and
white frost together and apply that to
the highest points under your arch so
right here and then blend it down and
then right here and stop I don't want to
go all the way in you can do that that's
pretty too I don't know why I'm not
doing it but I'm not doing it that's
pretty much it for the upper part of the
eye for the lower part or the lower lid
it's really simple you're just going to
take a tangle really see an angled brush
this is by stargazer and going into
sketch and signed sealed I'm gonna do is
just too much this along my lower lid
and so make it too too dark just nice
precise and clean now wipe the brush up
really well and makes the three lightest
colors we use today and put those in the
inner corner so vanilla white frost and
Becks on to the inner corners now I'm
going to take signed seal with that same
brush and line the upper part of your
lid now I'm just going to apply some
mascara this is the Rimmel London's the
max of volume flesh this is a really
good mascara I use this almost every day
in my life and wine your wine line your
waterline with blood check flute line by
Mac and the points on falsies since the
Miley Cyrus video I'm all about corner
lashes so I'm again using my Truelove
lashes that I used in the - iris video -
this is my Manic Panic and I'm going to
put those on the outer corners of my eye
and then I will be back to show you what
we can do with the lip so be right
battle lips I'm gonna start off with a
concealer to make any color that's going
on top of pop this is a max concealer in
NC 15 now I'm gonna take this Mac to the
beach collection lipstick it's a luster
and it's called lazy day at first I
didn't want to get anything from the Mac
to the beach collection that was like oh
my when I saw that lipstick I was like
it wasn't all that spectacular to me
actually laid a lipstick on to the lips
Emily onna has those kind of cool nude
pink colors on their lips in this video
so Lazydays kind of warm color so now
I'm going to take Lady gaga Viva Glam
put that on my top lip because that is
more of a cool pink color and then smack
them to get off and for a lip gloss you
can leave it totally like this but I
just want to apply a little tad bit of a
lip gloss this is electric fuchsia and
I'm gonna zoom in again because this has
an amazing blue shimmer in it can you
see oh my god it's amazing so that
completes this Leona Lewis oh I'm so
sorry why do I keep doing that people
hate it when I do that um I hope you
guys liked it I hope you guys learn
something from it I'm gonna do a zoom in
because we can do that now to show you
the finished look this is the finished
look really confident glamorous eyes
with pink lips

to you next on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
