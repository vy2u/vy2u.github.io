tutorial read here and this is inspired
by Lillie Ellen's heart out here
I love Lily Ellen I love that she always
has balls and tits and I look that she's
always keeping the shade keeping the
shade and I love that she's just
throwing shade out there I said today I
decided to recreate her opening look in
the music video with the fierce black
liner golden shimmery lids and then
rhinestones on the lid as well with the
perfect sort of red orange matte lip so
this is the look that I'm recreating
today if you want to know how to get
this little ELO look then please keep on
watching so the first thing you want to
do is apply a base your eye lists to
plant the eye shadow from creasing in
the one I'm using is my Mac soft ochre
Paint Pot the first eyeshadows we'll be
using our this lightest color from the
Bobbi Brown rich chocolate palette I'm
sorry for these horrendous nails time I
do not have it and I'm gonna darken the
color a little bit of using Illamasqua
heroine and just on the outside of the
crease bring in some definition but make
sure you keep this on the outside and
you also want to kind of flick it up a
bit so it has a nice wing but not too
much on the lid I will be applying this
illusion dump by Chanel called a vision
and just apply this as a base to the
eyelid only and this is a gorgeous
product just look at those little
particles of shimmer uh and over that it
will be applying some makeup studio
color pigment in citroen and just go
ahead and Pat that over the illusion
dumped by Chanel I love saying that word
it's so luxurious and then you get this
gorgeous sort of soft yellow gold
shimmery champagne color it's absolutely
stunning on the outer part of my lower
lash line I'm brushing some heroine I
should have a illamasqua again
just to give that bottom lashline a
little bit more definition and for my
inner corners I will be using Mac's
vanilla pigment
and now it's time for the eyeliner and
for that Obi's in my mac black trick
fluid line and just make a really nice
cat shaped liner from that line go on to
the lid and fill in so you want the
thickest part of the entire eyeliner to
be on the outside and go thinly inwards
towards the inner corner of the eye so
you sort of get a really nice cat shaped
wing so as you can see the liner starts
are really thin and then ends in a
really thick flake but I'm not going to
do is highlight my waterline with my
coutries mate to stay inside I
highlighter pen and now it's time for
the awesome rhinestones on the lid what
I suggest using for this are nail art
sort of rhinestones and they look like
this they're really small and they come
in like tons of colors I have this wheel
with the sort of light champagne II
colors right here and that is the color
I will be using for my lid you want to
take a nail art stapler like this
you make dots with this you call it an
eel daughter or whatever you call it
with this nail polish daughter
I take gr eyelash adhesive and I place
dots of adhesive onto my lid and then I
pick up one of the stones one of the
rhinestones and then place them on the
dot Here I am and then you place them on
the dot of glue that is basically what
you want to do the pattern that I
followed is the wand line completely
following the eyeliner until about sort
of where your crease stops then one in
the middle above so you have one two
middle above one two middle above one
two middle above and sort of fill up
wherever it needs to be filled up so
that's basically what I'm gonna do
so this is the glue and now I pick up
the rhinestones and place them on top
but I'm going to do is apply some makeup
Cydia what approved 3dx or black mascara
to my lashes and then some falsies that
I cut in half these are the miss Otero
42 and I cut them in half and take the
shortest part and then glued that to the
outside of the outside part of my lashes
for the cheeks they kept Lily really
neutral and all the focus was going to
the eyes and the lips so for the cheeks
I'm just gonna contour a little tiny bit
using my illamasqua to contouring
Idiot's my Illamasqua eyeshadow in
heroine I've already done that so I'm
just gonna fake this part then to blend
that out and give that more sort of
depth
I took my Mac nude on board bronzer and
just smoked that out a bit also faking
this part because I also did this
already but it did not do already was
apply a little bit of blush and nothing
too major or too big because you want to
keep things neutral on the cheeks so I'm
gonna take warm soil mineralized blush
by Mac and just put some warmth in there
and then of course I'm gonna highlight
and for that I will be using my Mac
vanilla pigment and brush something look
at that Lily were three lip looks in
this video and one of them was a super
matte orange lip one was a nude and one
was a glittery pink and they were all
paired with the same eyes so you can
keep the eyes on the lip I'm recreating
today is the matte orange red and for
that I will be taking my lady danger
lipstick by Mac which is a really bright
red with an orange undertone
and that guy's completes my lovely Ellen
heart out here music video inspired
makeup tutorial I love this look it is
so festive yet simple yet effective I
love this and I also love that this will
go perfect for Christmas New Year's Eve
