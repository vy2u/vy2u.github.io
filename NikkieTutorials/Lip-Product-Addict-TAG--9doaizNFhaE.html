Shen XO here on YouTube to do the lip
product edit tag and I haven't done a
tag video in the longest time so it was
so surprised and happy and excited that
Chen XO decided to tag me so so what the
lip product tag is all about is you get
a couple of questions about your your
favorite lip product she would have
thought so that any further ado let's
hop right on to question number uno okay
the first question sounds what is your
favorite balm or treatment now this is
one of the easiest questions you could
ever ask me because I've been using this
for I think six to seven years now I
always get questions on what I do to
keep my lips very soft and nourished and
moisturized and this ladies and
gentlemen right here is the answer the
Elizabeth Arden 8 hour cream eye I think
throughout the years on my channel I've
talked about this product so many times
and you guys know any guys know that I
love it
I apply this whenever my lips feel a
little bit dry or when they feel a
little bit you know sensitive this just
it's just lip perfectionist 101 in in a
tube I don't know and I always get
questions which one exactly I have it's
the Elizabeth Arden the original eight
hour cream skin protectant so you do
have to get used to the smell though
because the smell is one of the kind and
I know that if you don't like the smell
you will never get used to it but um
it's like second skin for me now that
smell is your number two sounds what is
your favorite eye catching red my
favorite eye catching red is of course
you guys can see this homecoming this is
max Olympics in crimson if I have to go
for it the perfect red lipstick its
crimson that makes my Mac because it's
the perfect mix of blue tone and red
town red plus it is just a perfect
coverage it has perfect pigmentation it
lasts it's not too dark it's not too
light it's like it's the perfect red
ever question number three the best
luxury and drugstore products I'm going
to start with luxury the first option is
my
hourglass femme nude nude number one
lips Tila lipstick this is one of my
all-time favorite new lipsticks because
I have a very pale complexion and this
is not too Brown into muskie and too
dark on me plus it just it really makes
your mouth really pale it has a nice
velvety matte finish and it just the
last four hours and I love the packaging
and I love our glass in and of itself
plus they come in different shades so if
you have a darker skin tone they will
probably have the perfect match for you
as well
so by far my favorite luxury brand
lipstick is by hourglass and it's the
femme nude lip Stilo but I do also
definitely want to give an honorable
mention to the ESN ha lipsticks
just because I mean the packaging it's
just the packaging is absolutely amazing
they have beautiful stunning colors the
only side to it why this is not my
all-time favorite luxury brand lipstick
is because I don't always love their
finishes sometimes they're a little bit
too glossy and cheer for me and I really
like having that coverage and being able
to make it share myself with like a lip
gloss or like a lip balm or whatever so
hourglass wins but a second honorable
mention are the Eastern haunts just
because of the packaging and the amazing
colors they have my favorite drugstore
lip product are the NYX butter glosses I
think I own almost every shade of its
entire range and I just can't get enough
of these date they just look so perfect
on the lips
they just transform into this buttery
creamy goodness and the colors are
amazing and what I love most about these
is that there are actually pigmented
like for example if I take a cupcake
which is this pink color and bam they
actually have a really good pigment I'm
gonna show you another one this is
devil's food cake one of my favorites is
a really dark wine red and of course it
is a little bit more sheer than you see
in the bottle but I mean come on
it's a lip gloss and it still has
amazing coverage amazing pigmentation
the smell of these is something you will
not get enough of they just smell like
bakery goodness I absolutely love the
butter glosses and
I just recommend them to everyone and
anyone on this planet question number
four is best MAC lipstick and for this
it's actually kind of easy because I'm a
day-to-day nude lip wearer I just made a
blog post on that so well yeah and on a
day-to-day basis there are two MAC
lipsticks that I gravitate towards every
single day and they're two nudes and
they're two of my favorite nudes and the
first one is hue and I've been wearing
this for so long this is actually my
second tube and look how small and tiny
it is right now I'm definitely in need
of a new one a beautiful warm with a
touch of coral nude color that just
suits so many skin tones and I just love
how this is nude but it's still fresh
and perfect to kind of livin up the face
a little bit doesn't make you look dead
or anything and then I also really am a
big believer in pure Zen pure Zen it's
just a tad bit of warmer and a little
bit more peachy orange but nonetheless
still was so gorgeous
and it's a tiny bit more pigmented
whereas hue is a little bit more glossy
and Cheer and this is pure Zen right
here so pure Zen is here he was right
there you is definitely a little bit
sweeter and lighter and the girlier and
this is a pure Zen which is a little bit
more um you know sophisticated and nude
and it just still beautiful so those are
by far my two favorite MAC lipsticks
Christian number five is what is the
most disappointing lip product and
unfortunately this kind of hurts for me
because I bought this in New York a
couple of years ago and it's gonna come
as a shock that I do not get the hype
around the tom fort lipsticks two years
ago I got a hold of the number nine true
coral lipstick by Tom Ford and I was
expecting to fall in love with it like
no other because the color is absolutely
amazing but somehow I do not gravitate
towards this I do not reach for it I
don't ever in my mind think oh let's pop
on true coral by Tom Ford I just don't
really get that love connection with it
and I I find it weird because so many
people and they talk about Tom Furret
lipsticks it's like they're having three
multiple orgasm
and it's like oh my god Tom for it it's
the most amazing lip product ever and
yes the packaging is absolutely fabulous
it's it's stunning it's gorgeous
but I just don't feel anything super
special about it I don't it doesn't have
place in my heart
sorry Christian number six sounds lip
liner yes or no I mean do I even have to
answer this question I mean in almost
every tutorial I do I start off with lip
liner not as much with a colored
lipsticks because I believe in when you
use a colored lipstick you have to use
the colored lipstick by itself because I
kind of see a discoloration between the
liner and the lip stick and with flash
photography long story I just don't like
it but when it comes to neut lips and
lip liner I say go for it if you want to
give that top lip a little bit more
oomph and a little bit more dish I I say
go for it mom ah two of my favorite new
lip liners are the Lancome LeConte or
beige rose I did this I did this one a
lot but my all-time favorite my number
one is the Bobbi Brown pale pink lip
pencil just because it is nude but it
has definition and it has color but it's
not too much and just that one does have
a place in my heart
question number seven your favorite
gloss of course again the butter glosses
by NYX
definitely a second place are the
whitening lightening color your smell
lip glosses and especially sugar mama
and coral craze have talked about these
two a lot before but these are just
amazing for when you are on a like pink
mood then I wear sugar mama as I am
today and if I'm more of - worth my curl
oranjee sort of mood of going for coral
craze got tongue twisters they have that
little light bulb in there and just I'm
wearing sugar mama today and it's just a
plus if you want to get a hold of the
wedding lightening lip glosses I have a
25% discount code and a discount code is
Nikki that's it if you want 25% off on
your order on whitening lightening the
color your smell
glasses just use code Nikki and you will
get 25% off so that's a little you know
steal right there we've already reached
question number eight which is the last
question and that sounds something else
and I have to I'm going to start off
with the Inglot freedom system lip
palette of majiggy I made a full blog
post review on this I will put the link
in the info box below but this is just a
freedom system palette by Inglot and you
can sort of compose all the colors
yourself so I purchase all these colors
and together I believe they are called
the color play lipstick palette I'm not
sure and and I love this especially
because you can actually use these as
lip mixes so you can mix and match them
so if you want this sort of orange coral
color to be a little bit more pink you
add in the pink if you want the purple
to be a little bit lighter like a lilac
you add the white so I always bring this
on shoots and shows and I did a lot
actually so I really love this palette
and then also who can do a lip product
tag without mentioning OCC's lip tars I
think the lip tars are absolutely
fantastic by OCC they have stunning
colors they have the most unusual
finishes and textures and colors and
shades and they're so good so pigmented
the company the people behind the
company are so sweet so nice I
absolutely love OCC and I'm especially a
fan of these stained glosses they are
just a little bit more of a glossy shiny
sheer uh you know variety on the OCC the
original OCC and one of my favorite
stain glosses is Aurora it's just a
beautiful bridal pink so on I just
wanted to give OCC an honourable mention
because OCC rocks so that's it guys that
concludes all the questions for the lip
