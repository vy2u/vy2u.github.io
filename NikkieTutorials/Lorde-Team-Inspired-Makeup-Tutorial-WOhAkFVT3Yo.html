doing the tutorial on Lords music video
called team and the look she's wearing
there it's kinda hard to see or make up
the kisses in the shadows and like in
this weird place with plants
I love Lord and I love her music and I
love this music video and team is one of
my favorite songs so I had to do this
makeup tutorial before I start yes I
know this hair makes me look like
Orlando Bloom in the Lord of the Rings I
just wanted to mention that a lot of
people told me that my December gets and
God knows did not appear in your
subscription boxes so I did upload night
December hit synagogue know so you can
click here if you want to see it but I
heard that it didn't show up in your
subscription boxes so I did upload it
and if you still haven't seen it then
click here and the link is in the
infobox below I do not know why YouTube
did that to that video I do know one
thing that if you really want to know
when I upload something is that you can
turn on email notifications when I
upload a video so if you want to know
when I upload something and you want
that on your email then you can
somewhere you can click on email
notifications on so go check out the
December hits and God knows if you
haven't seen it yet and if you have seen
it then please watch this tutorial on
Lords team music video so the first
thing you want to do is apply a base
here I lists to prevent this gorgeous
gold eyeshadow from creasing and the one
I'm using for that is my Mac soft ochre
Paint Pot okay so the first thing I'm
gonna do is bring some definition into
my crease and further that we'll be
using to Illamasqua products and one is
the disobey blush and this is her an
eyeshadow and I'm gonna mix the two
together and that will be my crease
color and just really simply map out
your crease and give it some depth and
don't be afraid to kind of blow it out a
little bit more than you're used to from
my lorac unzipped palette I'm gonna take
unspoken and mix that with the teal
Illamasqua shades used before and that
mixture is going on to the lower lash
line and again you kind of want to go
bigger than your use to kind of go down
lower then your safe zone you kind of
want to make the crease in the lower
lash line look like a brown soft haze
and I would say pencil brush I'm gonna
connect this lower lash line to the
crease at the side and sort of swoop it
in there and then with unspoken and
disobey blush only kind of darken up
this outer half right here for that
stunning gold color gonna take this
sugarpill pigment called Goldilocks and
what I'm gonna do is to mix that with
some water or what I'm gonna use is my
fixed plus by neck and mix it two
together so it becomes wet and literally
when this pigment becomes wet it's like
a liquid metal gold and that is exactly
what I want on my lids
oh my god oh my gosh oh my gosh like
really Amy the founder and creator of
sugar pill you are a legend for creating
this pigment
okay then quickly I'm gonna take another
brush a dry brush and go into the
pigment that is still dry so just sort
of take it straight from from the pot
and Pat that over the still wet sort of
liquid golden metal base please don't
hit this house with all these lights on
and then with a blending brush I'm gonna
go into the dry powder as well and sort
of blend the edges of where the
Goldilocks has stopped so the line is in
that harsh it can be a little bit harsh
I'm okay with that but not this harsh
for my inner corner highlight I will be
taking my lorac unzipped palette again
and this is undercover eye shadow and to
give it a more shiny effect I will be
using my essence metal glam highlighter
powder in gold-digger literally this
storm has gotta stop
hey clouds stop yelling at me for my
wedding Anya will be using micro trees
cosmetics made to stay inside a
highlighter pen and all you want to do
for the ice now is apply some mascara
and I'm gonna use my makeup Cydia
waterproof three be extra black and my
Makeup Forever aqua smokey eye in
waterproof ok now it's time for the
cheeks and what Lord was wearing was
just a
we sort of warm shape slash contours so
they contoured her entire face and then
added lots of sort of bronzy warmness to
it to kind of make it more edgy and
especially with the dark lips that's
just amazing gorgeous so I'm gonna do is
I'm first gonna contour with my heroine
eyes shadow by Illamasqua Moscow
seriously try it all together one Moscow
I feel like Barney from The Flintstones
huh okay then to F that worm that I was
talking about earlier
I'm gonna use my illamasqua blush in
disobey and that's the same color that I
used for my crease and lower lashline it
also kind of used it as a blush along
with this gorgeous warm sort of shape on
the entire face Lord was wearing this
amazing glow so what I'm gonna use for
that is my mac mineralize skinfinish in
lightscapade and then I'm gonna add a
little bit more shimmer here and there
using my essence metal glam highlighter
powder in gold digger
okay now for my favorite part of the
look the lips the Lord was wearing this
amazing dark dark dark vampy red /
purple lip so what I'm gonna use for
that is my NARS Train blue or table
velvet matte lip pencil by NARS and it's
a really really beautiful sort of dark
eggplant color
and that guy's completes my Lord team
music video inspired makeup tutorial so
