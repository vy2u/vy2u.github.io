looks in one video so last week I saw
the new music video from Eminem
featuring Rihanna and um I swear to the
dear Lord up in heaven above me this
music video is probably the most amazing
touching beautiful music video I have
ever seen it is it has the story
I love how they tell the story I just oh
my god I am in love with this music
video and the song so in this video I'm
gonna do two look so I'm gonna start off
with Megan's I'm really clean lashes
look and then I'm gonna transform that
look so this Rihanna look if you want to
know how you can get Megan's to look at
Rihanna's look and transform Megan's
look into Rihanna's look then please
stay tuned love the music video please
go check it out if you haven't seen it
yet so yeah I hope you guys like it and
please stay tuned
I'm going to start off with this bit
brush by Sigma and this is a 227 and I'm
gonna grab three color so I'm gonna grab
the vanilla by Mac I'm gonna grab just
by Mac and I'm gonna grab pink fries my
Mac so first hit some vanilla onto the
brush like that then take some chest
onto the brush and then just take a
little bit of pink freeze on the brush
and apply this to the lid and make it
stronger and prettier and now I'm going
to take it to thirteen my Sigma and go
into vanilla only and apply this to
Bravo then applies to the inner corners
as well and then go back with that big
brush take vanilla and just really
lightly padded over your crease area as
well for my crease color I'm gonna grab
wet and with a on 217 my Sigma I just go
into the color start in your outer thing
this car is really light so you probably
won't see it that good and then go into
your crease
so it's a really really like definition
into crease now is this much liner on
the upper lash line I'm going to use two
colors this is copper plate and this is
um science sealed and then with my
stargazer angled brush I'm just gonna
take copper plate first and smudge this
along my upper lash line smoke it up
and then take signed sealed and really
closely to the lashline smartly lighted
and if you won you can make it a little
angled just a little now for the lower
lash line I'm just going to take copper
plate and just put this everywhere
everywhere on the lower lash line and
then with um signed sealed just really
tightly to the lash line make it a
little bit darker they can always take a
219 my Sigma and then just blend it out
I'm not just gonna tight line my upper
lash line with a little bit up with them
virtual waterproof eyeliner just like
that part
um apply taupe has a steel eyeliner to
the lower lash line the waterline
um and then because um Megan's look is
like really clean and a lot of lashes
I'm gonna use like these single lashes
remember guys study is these medium
sized single eye lashes these are by
makeup studio I got this in a store in
Amsterdam called backstage amazing store
amazing so I'm going to apply it around
five of those and I know that sounds
like a lot but you really want those
like long girly lashes for a Megan self
real if I'm just gonna get my Mac lip
your race and just your lips out a teeny
tiny bit and if they're not as pigmented
as mine are don't use this step at all
and then I'm gonna grab Mac's lipstick
in pur vet and it's a glaze
it looks really like that but it has a
really nice blue pink sheet when you
apply it to the lips so I'm gonna apply
that um if you think this is a little
bit too dark for me you're kind of right
because Megan is a dark brunette and I'm
a lot of blonde so anything dark looks
really dark on me it looks natural on
her so now it's time to completely
change this look up and transform it to
be beyond a look that Rihanna were in
the video
I think that the most important stuff
when you reapply eyeshadows is that it
has to have something to stick to
now of course you can just take your
dark eyeshadow and just blopp it all
over your previous look but no way in
hell that that I Cho is going to grab to
something because the product underneath
it is dry so whenever you want to change
up your look from day to night or from
your writing I don't know why just make
sure you reapply some kind of sticky
base to make the new shadows stick to so
now it's just I channel is on my eyes
and I'm gonna grab on to products to
make the shadows that go on top from now
on stick I'm gonna use my NYX jumbo
pencil in dark brown I'm just gonna put
this all over the shadows onto my lid
and now the colors that go on top have
something to stick to
I'm just gonna grab a brush to make it
nice and blended and of course in the
crease you want the colors to stick as
well it's not just like you just want a
real pipe or something to live so for my
crease I'm just gonna go back with my
Michael Todd nude cream eyeshadow I'm
just gonna grab the brush that I always
apply it with and just place it a little
bit over the crease then grab your
finger and Pat it out first brush we're
going to take for this Rihanna look is a
239 by Mac I'm going to grab my Mac
Persky edge pigment
which is a deep purple with like a
blueish sheen you're going to apply this
to the inner corners of your eye and
city outer corners that's my dog
you you're barking the second color I
will be using on the lid is club
eyeshadow by Mac and this is like a duo
chrome it has like a reddish brown
undertone
but when you apply it over black comes
green and we have it on black now so it
will be greenish and just apply this to
the middle and work it out into the
purple now for the crease I'm gonna get
this 217 again my Sigma and go back into
club and to a warmer brown color this is
Swiss chocolate by Mac just take that
and apply this to the crease now I have
it brushed off and go in Mex copper
plate this is like a brownish gray color
and apply that into the crease as well
but a little bit higher just gonna grab
my signed sealed and line your lower
lash line all the way in and then take
your 219 by Sigma and go into club and
smoke that out if your Swiss chocolate
by Mac and smoke that out as well my
4-day lips it's actually the same as
Megan um the only thing is you're gonna
need them out a little teeny bit more so
I'm gonna go back with my lip erase
apply that to my lips and then the
perfet lipstick on top and that
completes the Rihanna look from love the
way you lie so in this video we did two
looks we transform the Mako Fox look
into the Rihanna look so I hope you guys
