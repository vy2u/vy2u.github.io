about the MEK counter opening in anko
finally we have a counter in a ZOA um I
think I was like half an hour away from
me so like when I take the bus like half
an hour away from me so I do not have to
plan a whole friggin days to get some
mech no I can just take the bus and get
me some much okay so yesterday on Friday
May the 7th there was the counter
opening in the bagels and I'm gonna show
you what I got I'm going to talk about
today I'm gonna talk about everything
and I'm also going to show you the
products that I bought last Tuesday
because then I went to Amsterdam with MS
lipgloss and luscious faith which are
Debbie and Cynthia and and her daughter
gave his daughter Bo and I'm going to
show you what I got in EM sir damn and
in a Toba so I'm gonna start with em
stirred em so last Tuesday the plan was
for me to go to Chanel and Chanel it's
not much mail like no oxy on YouTube but
Chanel isn't the brand um I stood up
really early to be on time and I wasn't
I'm but then when I got to my bus
station or train station and I thought
what they told me that the trains from
friggin and OVA didn't go to Amsterdam
so I had to go all the way from ain't
OVA to Rotterdam to Amsterdam which was
a whole lot longer than from angel to
Amsterdam so I went like this instead of
this I was like but then I thought oh
well I'm just gonna spend my entire day
and Mac so I did that so I got the five
things five and I'm gonna show you what
I got I'm gonna start off with my lip
glosses um I got this lip gloss in elect
fuschia and you're like Nikki you never
wear bright lips well since a couple of
weeks I do I do
I'm starting to appreciate my lip shape
a little bit more and I'm not such a fan
of bright lipstick but I'm a sin of dark
lipstick like Christina Aguilera's new
music video with the white and with the
big afro hair and a dark lips that is
what I love on me too but I'm not like
the bright red I don't like red on me
but I do like bright pink on me so I got
electric fuchsia lip glass and this is
really cool but because it's really
bright like it's bright fuchsia but it
has blue glitch ha and that's I'm
wearing this a couple of times already
with it just a nice winged eye or dark
brown taupe smokey eyes with this is a
gorgeous I'm a I'm a sucker for new
teeth so I got underage lip gloss and I
already told you guys on Twitter if it
was permanent or not and then it was so
I got it thanks to Cindy and all the
girls on Twitter they loved it too so
thanks to YouTube I'm getting more
makeup then I got two permanent eye
shadows I never believed the eyeshadows
for what they are always what you want
so I got honey lust and honey loss looks
like this and it's a luster and then I
got much and smut is a velvet color or a
celibate finish and it's like a green
it's not green it's brown but once you
apply it it kind of looks
you know me I don't know that's for
everyone and it has a nice taupe pink
Sheen and then for the last thing that I
got on Tuesday in Amsterdam is this no
here we go the print up up a press up up
a light over dark mineralized blush and
I tried this out and I love this um I
know this is every promote or REE REE
REE reef but I really like this and oh
my god I shred this to my mom and she
was like I was like I know so that's it
for Amsterdam and then any MEC counter
opening wait me MEC counter opening the
whole theme was MEC give me liberty
London or Liberty of London Liberty of
London collection it was the theme of
the opening so there was a seat with
with the liberty of London print and it
was a guy playing this guitar in it and
then there was a model with give me
liberty one and clothes on and she got
the makeup on it's like a live tutorial
with the makeup from Liberty love London
collection and it was the opening it was
they were really late they were really
late
was supposed to start at 10:00 I was
allowed to go in at 9:30 because I was
the journalist of that day so I was
filming all this up and they would give
me half an hour to film the counter
without anyone in it but it didn't open
at 10:00 they were opening at 12:00 so
we had two hours left near my knees and
her friend so we went into ant hill the
city - I don't know shop because we were
waiting so long we got cupcakes in the
mat give me liberty London style and
those are really comfy and I mean they
started and they open and it was whoa it
was crowd it was really crowded I got
recognized by I stink everybody that was
there like not everyone who was there
like hey no but like I got recognized by
at least 10 people and they were all
like I'm sure that girl from YouTube
through Nikki right are you Ricky right
I swear to god you look like this girl
from YouTube it was so fun that people
recognized me because it still feels
weird when you're like you're like in
the open world and people know who you
are like still blows me away that they
know who I am let me tell you that so I
got four things and let me start off the
basic paint and then the fun things
later on I got a backup on my Mac
blacktrack fluid wine because my old one
was finished I used it every day and it
was gone so I had to get anyone this
does anyone this is great for on your
waterline it stays put the entire days
and then I cut something new from neck
that I never tried again try that I
never tried before
it is democ so duct moisture cover
concealer in nw20 I'm pasty white and
when she said oh I think you're in nw20
for concealer I was
what she was like I think warmer colors
on your eyes are a prettier for the
light of her lawyer actually colors so
she recommended nw20 and I got home and
I was like why the hell did it trust her
wide to hell do I keep getting things
set and I trust it and I buy it and then
why but then I got home and I tried it
this morning before I did this makeup
and I was like damn she's right she is
right this is the same color as my skin
only a little bit longer because it's an
NW that's wrong right now for the last
two things I got worried the max give me
liberty London products I wanted to get
Burt's embarrass I shadow because all
the Mac girls and boy we're wearing well
they told me well the guy told me he
told me that they started with a black
base then put buff gray on top and
blended out into the crease and then
tubers and berries and put that on the
lid and then took the pink heart to
blend the crease and in the highlight
and a big false eyelashes you know they
use false lashes like no other they put
down and up and down and up I was like I
don't know I want to get my Black Jacks
little one and it cannot get to shadows
so I had to choose between two ships
between two shadows and no black track
or black track and one shadow and he
told me like girl birds and berries is a
beautiful color but you can fix it
yourselves to just take deep truth and
shimmer Moss or deep truth and what's
the color I'll put it in the imitations
and you will have that color and he said
like the buff gray it has never
been here before or he told me that I'm
not sure if it's a repo mo but he said
you really have to get it and as I can
see in your eyes you love color I was
wearing red eyeshadow I means that you
have to get it so I got the eyeshadow in
above gray and the packaging looks like
that
and it has two birds and then it has the
mech Liberty of London Liberty of London
and then the inside of it is all covered
with flowers and then the eyeshadow is
in a white container with a flower on it
a green flower why did they put a green
flower I'm Hank green and buggery is a
set in and it's this dark gray shimmery
gray color
this looks great they they tried it they
put it on their model it looked fabulous
this is great with pink lips great like
this is a yes go and then the last thing
is a lipstick they have the bright pink
day at the nudish color they have the
coral color and they have the purplish I
got the cruel color because on Twitter
again I talked to you guys and I was
like I need a coral color I'm ugh
oh well Liberty of London is a really
cool color and I was like oh okay most
of the girls again we're wearing it at
the contour and I loved it almost like I
have to have it so again this is the
packaging with the two birds here are
the bottoms of the birds and here are
the tops of the birds there you have to
live give london mac with all bunch of
flowers and birds and the bottom is up
to birds again and this is called ever
hip and then again the insides all come
with flowers and then again the
container is wide and it has this boat
and then you come to the flowers and to
the flowers and the flowers and then the
bird again it's a cream machine and then
it's a beautiful coral color I'm wearing
