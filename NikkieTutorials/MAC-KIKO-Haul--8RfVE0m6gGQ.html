Ibiza and I had a lovely time with looks
by Sharon here on YouTube and we had so
much fun we went for five days and first
three days were because the weather
was horrible I mean we expected I be sad
to be like sunny and sort of like sweat
your ass off and just you know wear
shorts and you know basically walk the
streets naked and we ended up wearing
leather jackets full-on leggings biker
boots and all that so the first three
days were weather was horrible but like
like the two of us had so much fun
anyway and then in the last two days we
had real I beat some weather where it
was like hot and like the locals were
nicer on the last two days because the
locals really where we were staying
really weren't that nice to us the first
three days so um yeah so my holiday was
amazing and to kind of get back into the
swing of things I thought it would be
fun to do a haul on what I bought in a
pizza and I mainly went to Mac and Kiko
and HECO is probably my favorite sort of
entire thing of today nowadays so as my
first video back from holiday I thought
it would be fun to do a haul and to sort
of chitchat and relax and just share
share my experience with you my look
today is inspired by a hair show I did
make up for yesterday actually in
Belgium my amazing friend Joyce who
could have seen in the Yankee Candle
haul was chef makeup for the hair show
so she was the boss of the makeup
department which included me in her so
and just in a really high fashion
avant-garde look for the show and I did
a really sort of soft sculpting lots of
glow red lip kind of look and this is
the look on one of my models and I kind
of took inspiration from that and
worried on my face today so without any
further ado let's go on to the hole so
I'm gonna start off with the Mac thing
because I only got two Mac things up but
to excited
maxing first I've got the mech 159 brush
and it's sort of a sister of the 130
brush I talked about in my March hits
and God knows this is sort of a a sort
of flatter more blush shaped a blush
brush shape wise thing which is hey is
this the exact same way as I described
the 130 brush in my Martinson god knows
video this range of that brushes is
amazing so sort of the duo fiber
combination brushes those are amazing
all of them I think it is spent freaking
tastic I might even like it better than
the 130 because this just buffs
information even prettier and it just
glides on even better so - 159 look out
for it in my April and hits and God
knows because I'm sure it will be in it
and because you guys know I love my Mac
natural radiance I have an Arabian pink
I also wanted the radiant yellow it's
the exact same consistency and formula
and touch that it gives to the skin as
with the pink one but the yellow one is
to fight redness a little bit more and
just I am a fan freaking tastic fan of
the natural radiance by Mac that's the
Mac stuff let's go on to the Kiko which
is really exciting
I love Kiko so I'm just gonna put my
hand in the back and just find out
what's coming out the first thing that's
coming out is from their new summer
collection this is the creamy touch
eyeshadow duo and I love the packaging
the box and this is 101 these were new
they had lots and lots of colors and I
got the most natural one of them with a
really nice of movi taupey color and a
nude color so I'm going to use the nude
color for on my waterline or to like
highlight and scopes my eyes or whatever
I want to highlight a sculpt and the
movie gray color is gonna go for like
sculpting decrees doing some eyelash
work I can't swatch them yet because I'm
gonna do blog post reviews them
basically all of this so I don't wanna
you know ruin the product yet but this
is amazing I'm really liking it plus
you're so smart approve it's insane
I swatch them on my hand on in the store
and I've just you know did some
browsing and just looked around and then
I wanted to wipe them up with my other
hand and it didn't come off so that's
great this is from the earlier
spring/summer collection I talked about
before and I also did a blog post review
on other pellets and this is the rock
attraction blush in number 4 pop apricot
and oh my god this is sort of like the
cutest brightest and clearest peachy
pink apricot color it's amazing it has a
really soft shine and it just really
pops next I got another blush by that
same collection and those O's rockatuer
blush number 2 in Guitar rose I love
this so much it's such a cool toned
bright pink but still under a little
more softer side so it's still wearable
and it still makes your complexion looks
so bright side awake and spring-like and
it's just I love this color last splash
of that collection is one of the more
highlighter shades they had a couple of
really shiny shimmery colors up the
blushes as well and this is the lightest
one this is the rock attraction blush in
number one pearly rock gosh holy
highlighter this is one Mac's vanilla
pigment and a natural flirt extra
dimension eyeshadow had a baby and just
dis came out it's a little bit cooler
than a natural flirt and a little bit
warmer than vanilla I really really like
this is a little bit more pinky on the
skin it has a really awesome gold pink
duochrome
and just I'm wearing vanilla today but
when wearing this it's a little bit
warmer and less cool tone and stark so
amazing color can't wait to dig in and
just brush it all over my face and feel
like a luminous goddess all day long
next is the dazzling highlighter in
moonlight gold I got this because of
Sharon as well she has been she's been
getting everyone on this boat to stick
highlighter and it is good the gold
shimmery shine this gives is amazing it
is a little bit on the glittery side and
it is a little bit much but I think for
like a party or if you're really going
for that ultimate glowy goddess skin
this will work perfectly then a selfie
stick blush by Kiko in for Cadillac pink
oh I loved this in the store and this is
again a stick and it's a blush and I
can't touch it I need to pluck posts on
it I would totally see this as like a
stick dupe for the guitar Rose blush so
if you're like more of a powder type of
person then go for this if you're a
creamy and stick kind of person go for
this but I like this I I was so
pleasantly surprised by this because
it's pigmented it goes on like butter it
just need a little bit I can show you
that yeah but in the story it was
amazing they had cupcake nail polishes
meaning that they dry in sort of like
that's a liquid sand finish but with
like a cupcake finish so they liked the
liquid sand at different colors this is
the first color this is the Kiko cupcake
nail lacquer in 647 and it's a really
nude soft soft soft soft lilac shade
with okay the cupcake colors in this are
blue red orange and I can definitely
hint old it a bit of mint and another
cupcake nail lacquer in 655 and this is
a mint green and the cupcake colors in
this are dark blue bright blue orange
and red and again I just effective these
are amazing I'm waiting for my nails to
grow out and for my cuticles to become a
better person because looks like
but once I got this all sorted out I
will do Neill swatches and post them on
my Instagram or or my blog or both some
organ polishes I got are the a380 which
is a really nice dark grey but it has a
eight sort of hint of purple in it
making it a little bit more wearable and
nicer to the skin and not as sort of
great and also I love this color this is
a 338
I can't even do it sort of like a mix of
periwinkle with like lavender and um
amazing I got the cuticle trimmer
so not exciting for on camera I also
went to make up sort and I got a
high-tech lighter in phone once the top
layer of this is moved there will be
like a red shine will arise who
remembers the Mac hyper-real foundations
now if you remember that then once you
held it in the light or in some certain
lights and all your skin he could see
this sort of red toned glow shine Sheen
or it was like red if you know what I'm
talking about as you know the hyper real
foundations by Mac got discontinued long
time ago and I always loved that shine
and I love the effect that it gave so
now I found the high-tech lighter by
makeup sort and full moon and once my
finger goes on top of this and smears it
out this sort of red sheen will come out
but it's a really nice wearable rat
Sheen and it's really pretty and it
makes your skin look so awesome oh I
love it
so yeah empty that concludes my Kiko and
mech and makeup stir haul from Ibiza
