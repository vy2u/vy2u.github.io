you the new Rihanna lipstick for Mac
called RiRi woo there has been so much
buzz about this lipstick and so much
wine dates and deaths about it that
everyone wanted to have it so let's just
start off with a little bit of
information Rihanna
always has been a huge fan of Mac's
lipstick in Ruby woo and she always
sports it on the red carpet and two
events and parties and she loves it so
mecha Rihanna kind of met together they
were like okay we need to work together
now because when one loves another you
work together so they decided to come up
with a new lipstick called RiRi whoo and
now I would love to show you the
packaging and everything but actually I
will have to put a layover on top of
this video because I found this in
advance because when i swatched this
lipstick it broke and when it broke I
had to put it in one of these containers
right here can you feel where this
review is going so when I got this
lipstick I was super excited because oh
my god it was RiRi woo and everyone is
talking about RiRi woo Instagram is all
about review whatever and I was so
excited and like the imprint of the
lipstick was so pretty because it had
RiRi in it and I was so SuperDuper
excited so I put my set up that I always
use her blog post reviews and everything
for better pictures product pictures and
I want to do this watch picture of Ruby
woo and I just swatch it on my arm it
broke the mother fudging review broke
you should have seen my face so let's
talk a little bit more about the
lipstick itself it's a retro matte and
that is a completely new finish to Mac
normally we have mattes but we never had
a retro matte in terms of color it's a
really nice true blue red meaning that
it has a blue undertone which makes your
teeth look whiter it can be other than
that I can't really say that the color
is all that special I mean it's almost
dead on to rooby-roo by Mac because it's
called RiRi room Ruby woo it's almost
the same
the only difference that I could give is
that the review is a little bit darker
and a little bit intense err and it's
not as drying on the lips I personally
really like this color but it's not that
damn special it's just I feel like with
this collection with this lipstick it's
just all about the name Rihanna and it's
all about them collabing and coming up
with this review color and other than
that it's not really that special yes
it's pretty yes it stays on yes it's
cool but you can get this color from so
many other brands probably cheaper as
well it does stay on really well and
it's still a little bit drying this
lipstick sold out in three hours on the
Mac website so we all have to wait until
June to order it again and in all
honesty don't bother I would only get
this if I'm a die-hard hardcore Rihanna
fan if I don't have a nice blue toned
lipstick and if I didn't have a matte
red lipstick yet so I'm sorry to kind of
 on the party it's that what you say
I'm a party pooper I really really want
to love this and I do kind of really
like the color but it's not that special
I would have loved to see like like are
we on on color where you like oh my gosh
because she tends to have that reaction
for me so again free reboot is sold out
for now but it will be back in June on
the Mac website and there you can order
it and this is how wearing it today duh
this is it's on my lips so thank you
guys so much for watching for a full
list of everything product mentioned
plus what I'm wearing goes to the
website tutorials calm you can follow me
on Twitter Instagram and Facebook and
find that all is Nikki just hurry up
thank you guys so much for watching I
hope I helped you out a little bit and
uh bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
