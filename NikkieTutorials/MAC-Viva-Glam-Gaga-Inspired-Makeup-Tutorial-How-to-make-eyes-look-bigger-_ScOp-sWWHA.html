from MEC cosmetics and I'm not kidding
right now MEC arrange a one-on-one
workshop with me and Elka venneman
senior artists from the Benelux for my
viewers only so a couple of weeks ago I
went to Belgium and met Elka Veneman
she's an amazing makeup artist who is
senior artist and mecca's medics from
the Benelux alga top numerous stuff
about Viva Glam the new Mac looks that
are coming up the new collections that
are coming
I want to thank MEC for giving me this
workshop with Elka it was an amazing
time and I want to say thank you so
today this video is all about MEC and
fifa glam + how to make your eyes look
bigger + lady gaga inspired us kind of
Paris Hilton inspire okay so the first
thing you want to do is apply a base to
your lips to prevent your eyeshadow from
creasing throughout the day and I'm just
gonna use a Paint Pot from Mac and this
is a painterly so Elka and in the Mac
email that I got they told me which
products they exactly used for Lady
Gaga's picture um the thing is I felt it
was brilliant and everything but I
wanted to change things up a little bit
to first color I'm gonna take is sketch
by Mac and I'm gonna take my 266 by Mac
so the first thing you want to do is
with the brush just make a line under
your eyes and you want to leave a little
gap open right there and this will make
your eyes look insanely big and then
just work my way in then once you reach
that outer corner just wing it out like
an eyeliner I'm gonna take a sable
eyeshadow by Mac and this is absolutely
one of my favorites I just got this last
week it's an amazing color I mean look
at that that's just gorgeous so I'm
gonna apply sable right under that line
for a nice smoky just like sultry
feeling now I'm gonna take this Wonder
Woman pellet in Diffie ons or something
and I'm gonna grab these two colors so
the light pink one and a purplish one
and with a MEK 226 I'm just gonna smoke
it down for that nice
ping tonnage is going on finish again
state this site is of way darker than
that side so I'm just gonna take my 219
again and I'm just gonna take some
sketch and carbon which is the matte
black and just darken it up okay now the
part that I like most is that lady gaga
thus this in every single look it
doesn't matter if she's wearing eyeliner
doesn't matter if she's wearing just a
shadow just lips she always uses this
trick to enhance her face what she does
is she takes a darker color of the
crease and she doesn't really follow her
crease line she just uh goes from the
outer point of her eye and goes all the
way up and then ends towards her nose
and her eyebrow um I know I have done
this in a couple of videos before but
now it's going to be really really
extreme because you're really going up
up up up and I'm really working in that
nose line what that will do is it makes
your eyes look insanely bigger that is
one two it makes them look more round
and more like you know and you get that
Lady Gaga shake and it makes your nose
look smaller so that are just a couple
of things that applying eyeshadow all
the way here does so the car I'm going
to use first is twinks so just gotta
take my 226 again I'm gonna go into
twinks and I'm just gonna start where I
stopped with the bottom liner and I'm
just gonna brush it up and I'm just
starting a little bit above my crease as
you can see and this is gonna go really
lightly and then work it in that nose
bridge right there you see how high I
went that is exactly what you want if
you want to recreate this look it just
makes your eyes look really sunken in a
really deep set and just oh I love this
and right here at the outer corners it's
okay to go in your natural line it's the
thing is that you want to keep in mind
that here you can go close to the
natural crease but as long as you're go
inside of the I go up into that
nosebridge
that's what you want to keep in mind if
you feel like you're going way too far
in and you think oh my god I look like a
weird person just take your face powder
and a brush and just uh slightly tone it
down not so much because then you will
lose the look you're going for
now with this palette from Wonder Woman
again I'm just taking it to 17 and I'm
going into you that purple and pinky
color again just mix them and just blend
that ride with that line just to keep
the pink look email if you want you
don't have to make it pink you can make
it brown you can make it I don't know
you can with green you can make it red
you can do anything now I'm going back
with my 226 and I'm gonna take sketch
again and I'm gonna darken up that outer
corner here just make it darker and more
smoky for the lid I'm actually gonna
take a pigment from make this is vanilla
and I'm just gonna pop that onto the lid
right there now wipe that 226 off you
have and take gesso a matte white color
and just pop it into the inner corners
that's all you gotta do baby and that
will open up the eyes like damn
your mama sucks are rocking off right
now this chrome aggressive pencil by
Mick and just make a waterline white but
I'm not gonna do is I'm going to line my
upper lid with some electric fluid line
and I have a video on that in my Ke$ha
tutorial the blue one where I do a
really heavy eyeliner it's the same
technique just a little bit smaller
these are maxi number three and those
are to stick together okay so for the
lips first I'm gonna I'm Ute them with
my lip erase then of course because this
video is all about the thiefbug line
lipstick I'm gonna take my Lady Gaga
Viva Glam lipstick in number two of
course you can keep it like this but I'm
gonna add a gloss on top and it's
lady gaga lip gloss because i think that
is a little bit too brown for my skin
color so I'm going to take Wonder Woman
the collection in emancipation something
so I hope you like this video
um again before I'm going to end this
you don't have to go this far in with
your eye shadow you don't have to apply
the big false lashes it's just take some
tips and tricks' out of this and just
try it out and if you do try it out
please make sure to send me a video
response because I really want to see it
