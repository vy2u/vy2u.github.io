inspired makeup tutorial a couple of
days ago and whenever I film a tutorial
my phone goes on airplane because it
kind of interferes with my microphone
right here so I finished filming and I
put my phone back on and I've literally
get bombarded with tweets and all I see
is Rihanna Nicki Twitter header lips and
I was like so I opened my Twitter and
literally I have about 50 tweets telling
me Nicki your Rihanna's new Twitter
header okay a lot of you wanted to see
this lip combo in action in a video and
wanted to see what kind of eyes I would
do with it and lips and you will not
lips and cheeks and everything so this
is what I would do with the entire look
right here so yeah if you want to know
how to get this Rihanna vehicle m2
inspired makeup look please keep
watching alright so the first thing I'll
be doing is applying a moisturizer slash
primer to my face to make the makeup
that I put on top look very good and
last and just easy to work with and you
just want to do this so I'm going to
apply the Mac complete comfort cream and
I really like this one because it's
quite thick and it's very very
moisturizing and that is exactly what I
wanted a because my skin feels kind of
drying today as always now for
foundation today I'm going to go with
the Mac mineralize the moisture
foundation in NC 15 and I'm first just
going to dot this wherever I want it and
then with my Sigma f80 brush I'm going
to start stippling and buffing this in
for concealer today I'm going to use my
Mac Pro Longwear concealer and my Creole
on derma color a cream concealer in d0
and I'm placing that right underneath my
eyes on on this very inner corner here
also and then we drag it down and just
do that entire highlighting thing okay
and then once I've got that mess all
apply to my face I'm gonna buff it in
with my F 86 by Sigma in I'll just out I
stupid bitch okay now I'm going to set
this all using some powder I'm going to
use my mac studio fix powder foundation
powder in number NW 18 and I'm going to
do brows then one eye off camera and
then it will be back
the first thing I'm doing is applying a
base to my eyelids to prevent the
eyeshadow from creasing and I'm using my
Mac soft ochre Paint Pot for this now
going in the Sigma brilliant and
spellbinding eyeshadow palette and I'm
taking the color balmy and with a big
blending brush I'm applying this to the
crease and then blending up and to the
sides you want this to be very smoky and
blended out and hazy just sexy really
from that same brilliant and
spellbinding Sigma eyeshadow palette I'm
taking radiant and I'm applying radiant
to the inner part of my crease very
lightly and wipe my brush off and
diffuse the edges and blend it in with
balmy and I love that later on we're
going to have that really sort of dark
taupey brown lip and then that warmth on
the eyes I love that I'm going to
highlight using the shaping powder by
Mac called emphasize and that is just
going on my brow bone and with this you
can really blend out radiant as well and
I also like to load it up on this inner
corner here I'm taking a bit of makeup
geek mocha I shed
out and first I'm applying this right
near the roots of my lower lashes about
halfway in then from there I'm going to
go back into the crease from that lower
lash line up to the crease so you can
nicked it and then slightly start
blowing it to the sides and then still
working with mocha I'm building this up
on the very outer edge of my eye a
really build definition there as a base
for my lid I'm taking this makeup
revolution awesome metals eyeshadow in
magnificent copper and this is a really
nice creamy product so I'm just going to
take it with my finger and dab it on to
the lid it's very very pretty and
sparkly and intense but I just want that
sparkle for my base so not as much the
color more so that's sparkle because
that is brilliant over top of that I'm
going back into the stigma brilliant
spell lighting palette and I'm taking
number 10 and I'm simply applying this
over top of that awesome metal eye
shadow by makeup revolution and you
still get that amazing Sparkle from that
from that base but you slightly shift
the color a more topi way okay now for
the very inner corner you first want to
make a new sort of tear duct area so you
want to take a black liquid liner and
then draw a tiny tiny mythical little
line on the very inner corner and you
drag it out of it so you create this
elongated inner corner for this I'm
taking my NYC
eyeliner liquid liquid eyeliner in black
you know I got this because of Krispies
and this is going to be so balls hard to
do on camera so I'm probably going to do
it off camera and then mimic the
movement okay so I did it how you do it
you want to tilt your head down creates
a sort of third pin and then you want to
make a
little tiny line coming straight out of
your tear duct from that point there you
go back into the eye and then fill that
little gap up now going back into mocha
I'm going to follow that new sort of
direction that my new inner corner went
to and then in between this we're going
to use a sparkle because what sparkles
really reflects the light and that
really gives you that feeling of a new
sort of inner corner creation so to make
my sparkles stick I'm going to take my
makeup Forever aqua liner in number 19
and first lay that down as a base in
between the two new lines what's
basically your new in a corner now now I
like to go in my makeup studio dual
effects in shine and go right over top
although what I line I'm going to pop a
little bit of white liner this is a milk
jumbo pencil by NYX and I'm just tracing
this on my waterline away from the black
so where the black stops right there you
want to go with the white and this will
really open up the eyes okay now with
that same NYC liquid liner going to
create a nice dramatic winged eyeliner
on top
now all you want to do is finish the ice
off with a little bit of mascara I'm
using my makeup severe waterproof 3d and
extra black ephra lash this is going to
use the X o Beauty soulmates okay for
our cheeks I want to be bronzed glowy
and just super super sexy so first I'm
going to contour using this eyeshadow by
Illamasqua this is called heroine and
I'm just going to carve out my cheeks
with this then to warm my complexion of
amusing Illamasqua blush in disobey and
just from that contour buff that out
sort of as a blush that's coming from
the contour and it's not a blush because
we have these brown eyes warm skin we're
going to have brown lips you kind of
want to have a little bit of life
somewhere I'm going to go for a pink
because that really punches up the look
and affirm that I'll be using my Mac
blush in love cloud and smell and put it
on your apples and this just brings back
life into the look too much Browns and
bronzes and golden shades can really
make your face look tired believe it or
not so by adding this pop of pink to the
cheeks
you kind of look alive and happy and
healthy again for my glow today I'm of
course going to use my Becca shimmering
skin Perfector pressed in moonstone
new mimosa PIM it's time for the Rihanna
Viva Glam to lip combo set so I do want

course going to start with the lipstick

bit of the Viva Glam Rihanna to gloss
over top because I really like the combo
