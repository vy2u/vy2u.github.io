Glam miley cyrus said today it was a
good day today because I received these
and I wanted to create a makeup look
inspired by these two sort of what I
would pair with the set right here and I
came up with this um I call it like a
glitter something it's it's a lot of
glitter it's a little bit of a cat
shaped eye it's a little bit pinup II
but modern II with glitter and it's I I
really this is my right here girl
see if you want to learn how I got this
look right here then please keep on
watching alright guys so the first thing
I'll be doing is applying my base and
I'll be using my Mac soft ochre Paint
Pots and I'm taking my zoeva 142
concealer buffer brush and I'm just
going to buff this in all over for my
crease color I'll be making a mixture
with melt cosmetics unseen and makeup
geeks Mango Tango and this is just going
right on the outer part of my crease now
going in with melts blur eyeshadow and a
Mac 224 and you lightly want to go above
what we just placed and blur is a great
color as it says to blur everything out
so it's a great transition shade for my
inner crease I'll be taking on Nastasia
Beverly Hills a vibrant pink so from the
brown it fades into that pink and the
first I'm using for this is the 228 by
the way fuh for the lower lash line them
again taking melts unseen and mixing it
with Anastasia Beverly Hills China rose
and this is going right on the outer
corners of my lower lashes
smudging that in and I'm again only
going halfway in for the inner corner
and taking a little bit of a white cream
product and with this I'm going to
highlight that very inner corner and
formulas of using unexciting Beverly
Hills cream all right now it's time for
the glitter the glitter I'll be using is
vile it and it's the Abba shimmer size
in number three and the glitter adhesive
I'll be using is also my lit and that is
the clearly liquid glitter base so first
with a brush I'm laying down that lit
clearly liquid glitter base and then
with that same brush gets into the
glitter I applied straight to where I
want it and then I'll also apply some to
my inner corners okay once I've got that
on I'm gonna work on my eyeliner today
I'm going to go for a half liner because
I really want that gold inner on the
inner half of my eye to pop and then the
eyeliner to kind of ground the look and
make it more wearable so the eyeliner
I'll be using today as always is my
cavity trooper
and I'm going to clean that up with a
little bit of concealer now to add some
fun to the look I'm going to take one of
these that these are little mmm I don't
know what these are these are to
decorate stuff and I'm decorating my
eyes with them so I'm going to take the
smallest size which is this one right
here actually before I do that I'm going
to put down some glue for where I wanted
to go red zel and pick it up with a
tweezer and pop it right on the glue
part all running quickly going to curl
my lashes then some mascara
and the one I'm using is by makeup
studio is c3d false lash effect then for
latch isn't going to take the outer half
of the Miss adoro 7:4 7ms and these are
going on the outer half of my eyes only
and that will enhance a sort of cat
shape alright time to focus on the
cheeks first I'm going to contour using
my Illamasqua eyeshadow in heroine in my
last video I talked about using the NARS
eita brush people have been dying to
know what I think of it so far I don't
really love it for the cheeks I do love
it to contour my nose but I will talk
about it more in my hit's and god knows
for the end of this month
to further bronze up my face on taking
the two-faced milk chocolate light
medium matte bronzer just on a really
big brush I'm going to dust that on to
the highest points of my cheeks from the
hairline down on to the forehead and a
plus is that it smells so good it smells
like chocolate it's amazing okay now I'm
quickly gonna bake my contour by using a
light powder underneath and that will
make the contour more sharp and clean
and it will highlight where I put the
powder so no I will not be leaving it
like this don't you worry then for blush
again I no Luminoso by Milani I know
you're getting sick of me by using this
but it's such a great color it's just so
amazing and it's so affordable and it
just it makes it makes you look good and
I love it and I'm using it and then for
my highlighter I'll be using the Becca
shimmering skin Perfector in moonstone
so first I'm popping some onto my
Cupid's bow and also the tip of my nose
and the bridge of the nose also and of
course the highest points of my cheeks
to give myself glare we're again also
now it's the time to brush away your
cooking or your baking all right so for
lips of course I'll be using the new Mac
Viva Glam
Miley Cyrus and I'm applying the
lipstick first and the gloss after and
