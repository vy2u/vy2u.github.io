on Kelly Osbourne's look for the met
collection promo for the collection that
they're doing with Mac the promo oh my
god so Kelly Osbourne and her mom Sharon
are doing this amazing Mac collection
and I am I'm just counting the days till
it's in Dutch stores here I already own
one blush got it from PR but I can't
wait to for like the pellets and the lip
products and just so I absolutely love
how these two ladies look and I
especially love how sultry and smoky and
phanpy and sort of soft grungy Kelly's
Lucas because it has that purple but
it's really low on to the eyes and then
it's got that um I made the sparkles up
because I could not see what was on her
lids so I kind of took my own spin on it
so yeah this is sort of my inspiration /
interpretation on her look that she's
rocking for the collection promo image
yeah if you want to know how to get this
look inspired by Kelly Osbourne then
please keep on watching okay so the
first thing I'll be doing first skin is
applying a radium primer I'll be using
my L'Oreal Lumi magique base cali skin
did have more of a matte finish but it
still had their really radiant touch so
it had a little bit of a radiant shine
and just a glow to it so I'm just
applying this to my complexion then
because I wanted my foundation to have
that matte finish but still have that
radiant glow from within I'm gonna go
with my L'Oreal True Match in and one
and as always I'm buffing this in with
my makeup geek Foundation stippling
brush
that is always to further perfect my
skin I'm going to use some concealer and
highlighter for concealer I'll be using
my Pro Longwear concealer by Mac in NC
15 under my eyes and to highlight my
complexion and I'm gonna take the Mac
prep and prime radiant rose highlighter
and just like usual blending it in with
my Sigma f80 6
okay what I'm not gonna do is set my
faces and my chanel natural is finished
powder in 20 Claire and also do my brows
off-camera and one eye so I'm just gonna
do all that right now because takes way
too much time to do that on camera plus
I already did separate tutorials so I'll
be right back
so for ice the first thing I'll be doing
is priming them using my soft ochre
Paint Pot by Mac now I'm gonna take a
bit of Mac's sugar snack i shadow i know
this is a limited edition but just take
a light pastel pink color and I'm gonna
start blending this above my crease and
really diffuse it up now I'm gonna take
a little bit of Mac's sketch I shadow
and I'm gonna start applying that to my
lower lash line and this look is very
smoky and hazy so go down with this and
then taking a bit of matte black
eyeshadow and darkening the outer part
now I'm gonna take mix / fate more and
stars a rocket and what I'm gonna do
with those is blend those on the inner
part of my lower lash line and again the
lower lash line was so smoky and sultry
and blended down so don't be afraid to
really exaggerate this part even with a
bigger brush and stars and Rockets only
I'm gonna dab that just below the tear
duct area but still sort of in that
inner corner and it might look a little
bit bruised and it might look a little
bit you know much but this is what Kelly
was wearing she was rocking that purpley
shine very close to sort of the eye bags
and weirdly enough it looked absolutely
amazing on the promo so I'm following
that okay now I'm gonna take a matte
black eyeshadow again and start on my
wing I'm gonna take an angled brush and
start you know building the first line
for my wing and from that point I'm
gonna bring it towards the lashes and of
course fill in
and with a really small and precise
angled brush I'm gonna continue that
line all the way to the inner corners
and just make it thick and luscious now
a very important thing I noticed with
this look is that Kelly went all the way
into that inner corner and sort of made
it a little triangle thingy it's not
super intense where as you would see was
like the Bollywood looks but it is there
so I'm gonna add it with that really
tiny brush so just drag that corner out
and then flick it back into the
waterline now it's time to add more
definition to the outer V increase and
for this abusing sketch again and this
is cupcake by makeup geek and I'll be
taking those two colors and blending
them in my outer V sort of the outer
part of my eye blending into the crease
and it's okay to go all the way down to
the lash line just add quite some
definition in here and especially with
cupcake you want to work more towards
the inner part of your crease so more
sketch here more cupcake here I think
now is the perfect time for some sparkle
I'm gonna go with my pressed pigment by
Mac called a sweet acting I'm not sure
if Kelly was wearing some sparkle on her
eyelids but I think it will go great
with the look so I'm gonna do it and to
make that stick a whole lot better I'm
taking my little ear lis liquid glitter
base some first taking that lit base and
applying it where i want my pressed
pigment to really stick and then taking
the pressed pigment and putting this on
top on the lid meeting with the darker
colors here
to really highlight and sparkup my inner
corners I'll be taking makeup geeks
shimma shimma and I'm just sticking this
right here on the very inner corner and
then going a little bit onto the lid and
up okay now really wanting to smoke out
that liner so I'm taking my black
eyeshadow again I'm just diffusing the
edges you really don't want the eyeliner
to be super eyeliner II you want it to
be more like a smoky haze but you do
want that inner part of the eyeliner
here to be very sharp so it goes from
sharp to blurry
Oh my waterline I'm gonna play a little
bit of essence a long-lasting eye pencil
and black fever and then quickly I'm
taking stars and Rockets and perf a am
organ and softly blending that to the
outer part of my crease quite high up to
really you know tied that entire
pinkness and purpleness together alright
so once we finally got that all going
it's time for mascara and lashes I'm
taking my waterproof 3 D extra black by
makeup studio and for the bottom lashes
I'm going with my Mac extended play
gigablack lash and for falsies are gonna
take again my Shen XO XO Beauty lashes
and these are the Romantics okay so for
cheeks of course we're gonna start off
with a little bit of contouring do I
need to say more no so I'm gonna take my
heroine I shadow by Illamasqua
and just sculpt out those cheeks and
then it's time for blush I want to go
for a really bright peachy color because
there's a really light peach on the lips
I kind of want to you know match it with
beating the purple tones use the blush
I'll be using is my MUA
I know you Chalker this is shade number
4 and what you want to do is place this
somewhat higher onto the cheeks so just
take your brush and smile and really go
on top of your cheekbones not really on
the
apples on the front but more so really
on top of those cheekbones working your
way to the front softly and Kelly did
sort of have that velvety matte finish
but it still had a little bit of shine
strategically oh my god
Hartford placed on their face so I'll be
taking my Mac soft and gentle and just
take a little tiny bit and of course as
always highest points up the cheekbones
I don't care how many you want to look
the tops of your cheekbones should be
glowing and then I'm also gonna do a
little bit here on the nose and just
kind of brighten up the look a little
bit more take a little bit and place it
underneath the eyes now if you're a
little bit more wrinkly there skip this
because you're only gonna accentuate it
and you don't want that for ellipse you
want to go for this very very pill sort
of peachy orange II touchy lip I did
find the lips to be a little bit too
pale in the campaign so I'm just gonna
change it a little bit what I'm gonna do
is mix OCC's interlace lifts are one of
my favorites with just a tiniest bit of
white lip mix by Mac you can use a lip
tar for this as well can't find mine so
interlace already really neutralizes the
lip and makes it really peachy and light
but I I want to make it a little bit
more wearable than Kelly's look but
still not as dark as interlace so I'm
kind of going in between oh god no no no
I'm no I refuse I'm just gonna go with
interlace only I mean come on
so that just gives you that really nude
peachy touch but without going almost
that white milky nude that Kelly was
rocking there for the tiniest bit of
gloss I'm gonna take this Chanel lip
gloss the law summer blossom mouth no
mouth and this is number 188 and this is
called sunny and just you know
site rim and that guy's concludes my
Kelly Osbourne mech collection inspired
