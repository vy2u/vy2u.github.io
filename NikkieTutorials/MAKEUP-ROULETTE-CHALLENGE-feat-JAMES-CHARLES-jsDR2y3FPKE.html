challenge so we have a ton of different
makeup challenges all folded up in this
mr. is hot right here meet sue so we're
just gonna pick three of these and then
I let's pick on three that I'll explain
from there ready
Johnny go first sure my first challenge
it's like a fortune cookie but like
worse yeah Oh fine straight back solids
no mirror for face makeup okay I got
opposite hand for base makeup no anyone
Johnson for sale I have a talk through

that's not a challenge well you're in
luck today cuz you will be choosing
three eyeshadow colors for me okay so
this is the challenge inspired by Alyssa
Ashley she does her like makeup wheel
worst you me to where she spends her
wheel she picks three color so I get to
pick Nikki's eyeshadow look today let's
go okay our last challenge if you pull
green shadow into the studio Oh God okay
so I have eyebrows with my eyes closed I
can't wait great then what do you huh -
product swamp let's do this let's do
this so what we did was place a little
paper in front of my face so I can
actually not seen my face anywhere
I just see me looking pretty so I have
to use my left hand
that's easy though what's no that's easy
stuff no I actually don't want to do
this anymore can we just do a get ready
with me no okay you just do my makeup
instead no can we can we cancel all of
this no okay largest guide me okay just
guide me I'm picking it up pressing it
on oh my god
I don't like that I feel like yeah I
wouldn't know what to look at if I was
in the no meter one I don't know what's
oh that was a lot of product listen I'm
doing my concealer with my left hand
oh that was moving on okay so you get
your concealer and you go up your nose
well cuz I like to like a snatch my nose
and make it like super super super
intense I go here yeah cuz that like
helps the illusion I don't see no
illusion right now like I cannot see I'm
Michael literally looking out of the
window like help I know we're so used to
like staring at ourselves during this
process we're so vain I don't like this
hand I don't like not having a mirror
well at least I can look at you and
pretend it's me out of all the
challenges that you've done what do you
think is your favorite challenge I think
I like I like doing the one with my
mom's makeup that was a good video
because it was like such a trip down
memory lane and I love that I did the no
brushes makeup challenge a long time ago
but I literally turned out so good I can
feel my hands cramping up oh I have that
when I did that challenge oh my god I
was proud of my eyes oh hello hello is
anyone out there I can see you're just
setting my makeup that tastes so good I
want to eat it I know right every time I
put it out like oh I feel stupid I like
also I keep putting myself out of frame
welcome to my challenge with Charles why
don't you call me Charles did James part
is not here it's out of focus Oh James
left the building it's just
it's just Charles right now hello kids
can't pick up the phone right now why
he's dead he's halfway on the frame I'm
going to contour my face now I am going
to die
oh my call this is really hard when
using the benefit hoola bronzer and my
morphe M 5 to 7 these Co James or Nikki
for 10% AHA oh I have to contour my nose
in my left hand like right there
I'm sure people will think I'm looking
into a mirror but I'm not I'm actually
looking into space I can verify that
this is in fact true so when did you
start getting into makeup two years ago
two years ago yeah it was just two years
in October
yeah it's been a literally other
craziest two years my entire life two
years my life hold on sale cuz you
started YouTube you're like the OG yeah
I've been doing this for nine years
you're one of like the oh geez that's so
crazy
I've seen everyone come one girl a few
trends come and go
what do you think has been the biggest
change in the beauty community since you
started nine years ago to now well
there's a lot of sort of like waves of
certain videos that do really well huh
so a couple of years ago I think like
four years ago the wave was hauls yeah
and like room tours and like how I
decorate my room
and like this is what I bought so it was
not focused on like actual makeup but
like buying makeup or whatever and I
feel like right now we're on a wave of
first impressions reviews trying out
product yeah whereas when we go back to
like the beginning it was tutorials
tutorials tutorials to tour aiya missed
those days I missed it too I love makeup
so much Sam I feel like we're definitely
like two of the ones that kind of got
into makeup for like the art of it yeah
on my channel me and if you're doing a
super fun challenge that I'm very very
stated for and you guys will have to
head over there to check it out it does
involve creativity for sure but I do
wish like tutorials kind of would come
back inside because nobody watches them
that's where like we get to really
express herself as artists and stuff I
really want you to contour my nose down
when not for this not right now I love
salt I'm going this is Laura can you
remove the pipe already three two one
that's not bad that's not at all

one oh I get to pick your three
eyeshadow colors three eyeshadow colors

purple you are not a nice palette of all
rainbows at least you got to use a mere
four I need to now close my eyes yes

while I think I should just work on the
tail oh he's doing the easy way out what
would you say is your favorite part of
your makeup routine
Oh eye shadow same oh what's this with
green this is so hard I don't know where
my eyebrow is if you're looking for me

guide here okay you actually messed up
for once no oh my god

product swap don't oh yeah oh you know
what I think I have the perfect products
often wine miss tutorials which is what
I'm rethinking those you cannot you can
oh I'm just a black gel liner if my
brows are getting busted

like any artist and binding right now do
you want to see them yeah I think I'm
ready to luck I'm done oh wow I love

horrible
