goodness this video is gonna be an
emotional mess it's been a while since
I've been here on my channel live
not pre-recorded if you don't follow me
on social media or on my channel for a
couple of years now I have something to
tell you and I'm not gonna cry in this
video I just I can't I I will not a
couple of years ago I let people know
here that my little brother was
diagnosed with cancer I know great start
of a video so happy yay two and a half
years ago we found out that my little
brother had cancer and it was a long
long battle that he unfortunately
eventually lost there I go my little
brother Makai is about the strongest
syllable dude I've ever met in my life
and I'm not gonna cry stop it me guy was
about the strongest little dude I've
ever witnessed in my life so strong so
inspirational and so brave and I just
want to say thank you for giving me the
time to be with my family and to heal
and to get my mind in a better place
because it felt so wrong for me to talk
about something as a light-hearted as
make up with my brother passing away you
know the the contrast of the two was so
big for me that I can think of make up
for it a couple of weeks so today I'm
actually back I missed makeup so much I
thank God because I feared not missing
it ever again I miss it I missed the
blending I missed the precise --is of it
all and if there's one thing my little
brother was so incredibly proud of it
was my channel he lived for my channel
he looked at all the stats he looked at
all the subscribers he looked at all the
views he had advice for me on what I
could improve on he was the best and
today's video
is in honor of Makai and another little
something happened while I was away we
also reached 10 million subscribers my
brother has been sick for two and a half
years this has been going on for a long
time but at the funeral of my little
brother's funeral
we had balloons and the moment we let go
of the balloons is the moment I reached
10 million subscribers and you may
believe it or not and there may be more
stuff beyond this world than we know you
believe that or you don't but to me that
was me guy that was me Kai holding
everything together in the universe
Emile like and now you get 10 million
and I know I tweeted this and I talked
about this in snapchat and Instagram
stories and people gave me because
people thought I have my phone in one
hand and balloons in the other and I was
like no we gotta wait until I let go of
the balloons before I hit 10 million not
the case my manager was at the funeral
too and he was checking because it's
sort of his job and he saw that the
moment we let go of the balloons I had
10 million so to me that was so special
and that to me was me guy giving a
little sign that he's watching and that
he's so proud so in this video there's
two things I want to celebrate the life
of my little brother and 10 million
subscribers and for those 10 million
subscribers I have a little trip down
memory lane hey youtubers this is going
to be my first makeup tutorial hey guys
hello Christmassy right now hey guys
what's up now you're going to cut the
crease
my gosh truly brown pencil my new lip
gloss which is a Viva Glam Gaga which is
even prettier so today I am doing a
tutorial on how I contour and blush and
highlight my face once I've got the top
lip done of course you want to focus on
the bottom lip thousand subscribers on
my channel we got two hundred thousand
subscribers
yesterday my channel hit 1 million
subscribers and it's all because my the
power of make video went completely
viral hey guys I'm here today to show
you the power of makeup I just want
people to know that makeup is fun and
there are no rules to makeup seriously
the power of makeup Patrick and I are
going to transform into our favorite
Disney pretty exciting I feel like I'm
inside the YouTube that I was you are
now again I just want to take this
moment to thank all of you for choosing
me as your your following as your blank
as your inspiration
I'll kiss no mirror for face makeup we
look at my hand it's a really fun look
to do any wood I hope you guys like it
and stay tuned for my new video thanks
for watching love you guys I am so proud
and I am so thankful and so grateful for
every opportunity you have given me in
this life
yeah welcome to makeup therapy will I
call it already so me guys favorite
color was red so today's theme is all
about a red makeup look I want red eyes
I want red lips I want some redness
somewhere up that sounded so wrong the
first off foundation which I need
because my skin has been through it
alright so first I'm going in with my
favorite primer tatcha blank canvas
that's not the name of Tasha silk canvas
this primer is the bomb they bomb I tell
you I get it on there if you're asking
yourself Nicki where did your nails go
the grinch came early for Christmas and
stolen for a foundation today I'm going
in with this one right here I know a
shocker if you've seen my fancy Beauty
for you you know that this foundation
was my favorite but I want to give it a
second chance because people are loving
it
so I want to be able to love it although
I tried it already and didn't love so
much
literally the sound of step see what
time I'm so sorry and setting my under
eyes using the fit me loose powder by
Maybelline and I'm gonna need a lot of
powder because it's hot and sweaty
outside alright guys so the first thing
I'm doing for the eyes is prime of
course using my P Louise base and the
magic to this base is to tap it in as
you apply it so that is exactly what I'm
doing
the first color I'm going in with is
snatched from the lunar Beauty life's a
drag palette congratulations Mandy and
mixing it with Queen from the P Louise
palette of picking that up on a two to
seven brush by a zoeva and applying it
to the outer corner and as you can see
I'm just stamping this color on to get
the pigment there and eventually we're
gonna swoop this out and make it more of
like a I pulled out shape but for now I
like it nice and round it so I can focus
on blending for the blending I'm going
in with the bare color from the nudie
patooty palette from Laura Lee Los
Angeles picking this up on a Mac two to
one brush and just playing it right
above the red color to start our blend
and slowly but surely I'm starting to
pull out the shave more
now taking bear only and pulling it all
the way towards my inner crease taking
beach from the life's adrak palette and
this is going across my lid and going
back in with Queen from the pea Louise
palette to blimpy edges already so I'm
really liking where this is going but I
want a nice red liner so I'm going back
in with Queen from the pea Louise
palette and an angled brush to apply it
as a liner okay time to highlight that
inner corner even more using this
highlighter by Ofra called pillow talk
and lastly applying snatch on the outer
corner of my lower lash line not to
finish this eye look off some lashes and
these are lush by Lily lashes
okay so eyes are done now it's time to
focus on the face and while I talk about
the face I want to address a couple of
things that I just want to gather your
thoughts on so meek I passed away around
4:00 in the morning and my mom has a
Labrador Bowie bowing knocks the hell
out at night so when Bowie goes to sleep
she sleeps she doesn't wake up my mom
literally has to wake her up she always
goes knockout the morning when me Chi
passed away around 340 is when my mom
hears but we go insane downstairs no
it's very hard for her to catch her
breath she barks a lot she's just very
uneasy and just she there's clearly
something going on but my mom doesn't
know what so my mom thinks because we
spent the day with me guy all day and
someone else took care of the dog steal
it then pee and whatever
and also feed them my mom thought oh the
the carer must have given Bowie too much
food and Bowie needs to take a huge
so my mom lets Bowie outside and she
doesn't he
she doesn't poop she doesn't do anything
but she's still so uncomfortable and
barking and you know out of breath so by
the time she comes down a little bit my
mom goes upstairs to my stepdad and
that's when the phone rings the minute
my mom goes upstairs is when they get
the call that me guy had just passed
away
strange another thing that happened was
with me
as you know I'm a Nightbird like I don't
sleep around a four o'clock in the
morning a friend was over to keep me
company because you know life was awful
and around four o'clock in the morning I
have neon lights in my bedroom they
start like flickering and like the
intensity goes up and down and then it
just it looks like someone's messing
with the lights and in my mind I
jokingly said oh look it's me KY making
a joke that he's about to tap out and
the second I think that my mom calls me
to let me know that my guy passed away
such weird stories for pretty much the
entire family for example my brother um
who got the call from my mom that me KY
passed away steps into his car and the
first song he hears is Lincoln Park I
tried so hard and got so far but in the
end it doesn't even matter I think
everything happens for a reason and that
to all of those things happen for a
reason and maybe it's not my little
brother maybe it was my little brother
but I'm okay with the thought of
thinking that that was me guy trying to
give us a little sign what do you think
I think the hardest thing for both me
and my family is that we don't really
have the feeling that he's gone yet of
course we know he's passed away but to
us it pretty much still feels like he's
on holiday with friends and he can come
home
any second now like we're all just
looking at the door like okay any any
second I'll come back now we miss you
that's sort of the state we're in right
now it's not denial I don't think it is
denial I think if more so is a state of
not having that realization yet all
right this look is coming along really
nicely read for me guys so now it's time
to highlight
her lips morphe recently came out with
an Allred lipsticks collection and
Nikita Dragon was the face for the
collection so the first one I have right
here is more of like an orange II red
see how that's very orange toned and
since the eyes are leaning a little bit
more pink that's a no I also have this
one right here called morphe which is
more of like a like a true darker red
and then this one right here which is
like a bright bright red I think I'm
gonna go with dominate first and then
apply the really bright one
I lost the name I'll find it on the
center and then lover over top and that
guys concludes this red makeup look in
honor of my little brother meek I think
yeah I miss you so much I love you so
much
this one's for you I know you're looking
up there from heaven and I love you
let's wear something red in our makeup
maybe lipstick maybe an eyeliner maybe
your blush maybe your shadow let's wear
a little bit of red makeup just for him
maybe you can tag me on Instagram maybe
you can send it to me on Twitter maybe
you can do a recreation video something
in honor of him only if you feel like it
