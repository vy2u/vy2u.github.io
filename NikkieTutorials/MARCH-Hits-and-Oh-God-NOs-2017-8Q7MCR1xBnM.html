peppers behind and I did my foundation
using my normal sponge so before you
judge me the space was created without
any vegetable and welcome to my March
his Sena God knows and I feel like for
once of time of early like usually I'm
like way late today I'm like kind of
early so on this lovely Friday I have a
bunch of favorite products to share with
you I'm really excited to talk about
them Plus can we talk about the contact
this is something really new for me I've
worn these contacts for I believe like
three times to like events now and they
make me feel super exotic but also
really creepy and like a vampire
definitely sound off in the comments
down below what you think of these
contacts and if I should wear them more
often so without any further ado let's
go right into my favorites for the month
of March
alright quickly this one right here I
feel like I need to talk about it again
I featured the Lancome teint Idole ultra
24 hour makeup foundation in my previous
at synagogue nose but I kind of want to
bring it back because I went to a Necker
Island with Benefit Cosmetics and I have
the most amazing time of my life a 6
a.m. crew you know what's up and the
hair flip crew hello I just quickly want
to talk about this foundation because
this is the only foundation that I wore
on that trip and pretty much a lot of
people were like how is your foundation
still on and how does it still look good
so I just quickly wanted to mention that
if you want one of the longest lasting
foundations on the market it's probably
this one right here and it goes really
well with my dry skin so that is good
alright talking about fancy primers this
one I don't even want to talk about this
this one right here by Sicily is called
the double tensor long to wait wet in
the long term and what double prints are
instant and long-term primer it looks
like this I don't want to talk about
this because I believe this was a
hundred
and $70 this Sicily primer right here is
a primer that becomes so sticky and that
is exactly what I want when I apply a
primer I wanted to be stick City because
it grabs on to the foundation so that
makes so that gives me the security that
the foundation isn't going anywhere
throughout the day and with this I've
never felt a more sticky primer than
this one it smells really luxurious and
rich it's a really good primer for if
you want that longevity and if you want
your face to last and especially with
summer coming up we kind of want our
faces to last if we wear makeup outside
so it is the prices outrageous the
prices in a god know the products itself
is amazing now two of my favorites this
month were greatly inspired by my
favorite makeup artists Stacy Murray
makeup artist on Instagram and her work
my look today is actually inspired by
her work and I hope I did are proud
we've been talking to each other through
texts and she's such an amazing
down-to-earth humble crazy talented
person if you don't follow Stacy
on Instagram go do it right now she's
she's my favorite makeup artists out
there like her work I'm not going to
give away too much but when you look at
her blending and like precision and like
sharpness it's like it looks face tuned
but it's not it looks like it was
crafted by gods it was crafted by Stacy
so I've been talking to Stacy and of
course I am so curious to know what
products she uses to get that amazing
finish and she has been getting me on to
the Select cover up concealer by Mac now
I know that Stacy uses this as concealer
as well but I mainly use it to cut out
the lid so what she does is she applies
crease colors and like colors wherever
she wants it and then when you see those
really sharp cut lids like cut creases
on Instagram chances are it's done with
this now I type to sig meet before and I
would use my Pro Longwear concealer but
I found that because it's a see that
this one has a little bit more
you can ASSU it plus it's easier to work
with like little dust up on a flat brush
and just carve out that lid with it
that's what I did today and you will get
such a clean precise finish and then set
it with the eyeshadow or pigment that
you want and it's everything it's so
good oh and the color I'm using is nw15
all right next favorite that is also
because they see this one right here
this is by NYX this is called the
glitter primer now when you follow Stacy
and you are in love with her work
one of the most amazing things about her
is that she can apply glitter in such a
sharp and neat way in a way I've never
seen glitter apply before and so Stacy
told me that to make her glitter stick
she goes in with the NYX glitter primer
and this is what I've been using to make
my glitter stick for the last couple of
weeks I even like the glitter on the
crease right there this is right
underneath it to keep it down there and
I usually never really wear a glitter
outside of that I know shocking I know I
gotta confess I usually never wear a
glitter outside of the house because
throughout the day it will kind of
sprinkle and fall down onto my cheeks
and they look like a disco ball not that
anything is wrong with that but just
like for my glitter to stay where I
wanted it to be instead of like
everywhere and the next glitter primer
really does it for me it really keeps
that glitter on there it creates milfoil
that with it and it just it just gets it
on there right and precise and sharp and
I'm talking about glitters my favor
glitters at the moment are I'm opening
the package my favorite glitters are by
Helen II also because of Stacy she
introduced into the brand and the
glitters by Helen II are phenomenal
there's pretty much every color you can
pick up this one is this is the one I'm
wearing in my Korean set is called
confetti it's pretty much every color
glitter that you can think of and just
amazingly finely milled so beautiful in
the eyes beautiful to define that cut
crease with or all over the lid on your
lips wherever you want it so it's
it's where it's at few brushes I've been
really really liking are these two right
here let's talk about this one first
this one is my benefit and it is called
the the the hula brush I don't know I
did introduce to this brush Annika
island when I was with them on the trip
and okay I gotta be honest with you I I
had this brush before and I didn't get
why it looked green so it was kind of
sussed
and I was like no not using you so
apparently the green is just you know
decoration doesn't do anything like a
sister screen on ekor island ginger from
benefit actually told me or like
explained to me how to use this and ever
since I haven't been able to put this
down this is amazing to bronze your face
with but also softly contour so what I
do is I pick up my hula light and it's
the first product I will use on my
cheeks and like on my face and I kind of
just warm up my entire complexion and
what this brush it's so quick it's so
easy and effortless and it just makes my
fair skin tone look beautifully bronzed
without going too far so I've been
really liking this this was a favorite
in my last head synagogue nose now with
this brush it gets even better the other
brush is by elf and this one is coffee
foundation blurring brush and I have
been loving this brush to set my face
with so once I've done my foundation and
concealer I baked my under eyes and I
puffed my face using a powder puff and
some airspun or the Kat Von D powder but
then I kinda have to brush it away and
work it in and that's where this brush
comes in it is so phenomenal I love it
because it's so densely packed like it's
got a lot of hairs in there and it
really gives you that denseness and it
really helps taking your coverage to the
next level it's not a joke this time
it's actually true because usually when
I say till next level is April Fool's
but this brush house they're really
doing it for me and I've been using this
for like two months now and it just
helps my foundation stay in place as
soon as I hit it with that powder and I
feel like this brush really helps with
that
so if
you're looking for an affordable setter
brush look for this one I feel like
these hits are really about like
redemption it's like survivor Redemption
I feel like I didn't like most of these
products at first I kind of ignored them
went back to them and was like oh my god
same goes for Urban Decay all nighter
I've had such a love-hate relationship
with the spray right here I would have
months where I would be like follow
divers every day I've had months where I
was like all night it can suck my left
butt cheek it's such a love-hate
relationship until I found out and I do
I talk about this do I do this in a
separate video I found out about a trick
on how to properly set your face and
ever since I've started doing this my
longevity of my makeup has gone way up
but also the love for all-nighters
because before all nighter mmm it was it
was good but sometimes it would just
leave like little dots and holes because
like the sprinkles and I found a way to
make any setting spray work and I kind
of want to do a separate video on it but
I kind of want to tell you right now so
I want you to sound off in the comments
down below right now do you want me to
do a video separately on how to properly
set with a setting spray I'm so all
nighter we're on good terms now I think
we'll stay on good terms it's a really
good spray that keeps their makeup on
okay I've been holding this in my hand I
quickly wanted to mention that whenever
I did my finger blender video I never
expected for the finger blender and I to
become such good friends but this is the
only sponge that I've been using to bake
my under-eye area with this is the only
sponge that has that texture and like
shape and like whiff to like get up
underneath there and to set it and
forget it so I never I never ever ever
expected this but we best look now okay
that's I think that says I'm not already
getting started all right so I think
those are all my hits for the month of
March I want to go to what L Gaga what I
don't
will you kill me if I don't have one
dose now I know you guys love it
when I tell you about the products that
really didn't do it for me this month
but I'm looking around me and I'm like
y'all are cool with me I'm cool with you
like we good so unfortunately I do not
have no God no and don't get me started
on come at me with the you're just
scared of brands not liking you trust me
I've talked about brands that I loved
before and they had shitty products and
I would tell you that but right now I'm
looking around a pretty confident well
if it makes you feel better I am
currently giving Kiley's highlighters
another shot because my first impression
wasn't too amazing but like I want to
give it another shot but like maybe this
will pop up to be next month's oh god no
but you know I don't want to foreshadow
anything I'm just trying out stuff right
now so that's it guys that concludes my
March hips and Noah Gallo definitely do

the month were I'm so excited to see I
