beginning I went to an amazing two-faced
event was a two-day event and I had so
much fun there were such lovely amazing
beautiful girls they sent us home with
so much good stuff so much amazing to
face good stuff so I basically got all
their new pallets the
when I got is this one right here this
is the natural eyes I really really like
this one it's just a neutral glamorous
palette then they also gave the matte
equivalent which is the natural matte
eyes is a little bit more warm toned but
matte which is totally me of course we
know this then also they gave was the
Holiday Collection and the Holiday
Collection had so many palettes brought
to my socks off
so first up they have three of these
little palettes right here and the first
one is the black one which comes with
these shades right here aren't these
colors so good for the holidays this one
has got a lot more brownie neutral
colors and I really love the blush in
this one this is a pellet I'll use on a
daily basis and then the pink which is
also more on the natural side but it's
got more shimmer so it's a lot more
glamorous and glamorous then they came
with a little bit of a bigger palette
and I am obsessed with this one I've
been wearing this for a couple of days
now ever since I got it and I love it so
much the colors in it are so festive but
so glamorous and beautiful at the same
time I love this one and then the
biggest one of the collection is this
one right here I love the packaging this
was inspired by the shop in Paris called
Nadu hay which has amazing macarons and
just sweet sweet stuff so it was
inspired by Paris latter day you can
also see on the inside right here look
at these colors I mean can we die I'm
wearing this one on my lid today over
top of something else this one in my
crease this one too dark in my crease I
love this palette and I really feel like
this is a palette for everyone it's got
bright colors I've got neutral colors
and I love the pigmentation I love the
quality I love Too Faced so Too Faced
thank you so much for this amazing trip
I love you guys are we ready for the
crazy stuff now with Cameron Michelle
and Kim has her own YouTube channel as
well I'll link down below and I love
these two Kim Michelle are the most
amazing beautiful
we'll ever so they took me to Alta and
at ulta I went a little bit ham and they
also took me to Sephora basically
whatever I bought I basically pretty
much bought with them so the first
pallet that can make me buy was the
lorac mega pro 2 palette and I know that
desi brought it with her when we were
filming our get ready with us and I
could not stop staring at it and she
worried the night before when we had
dinner and obsessed with everything this
is what it looks like I love it this
palette has got everything you want in a
palette it's got shimmers it got mattes
it got warm schools highlighters dark
colors the pigmentation is amazing I
love I love I love
now just one I'm super excited about
because I've always been a huge fan of
the lorac unzipped palette but now they
have the lorac unzipped gold
I want to dunk my face into this palette
can we dye these two color side here red
in the center
art they have my name written all over
them they got nice warm Browns these are
all matte these are all shiny and then
this one at the top is matte as well I
love this palette I have a feeling this
is going to be on my eyes every other
day I love this so much I got the Make
Up For Ever Ultra HD foundation and you
already saw me using this in the get
ready with me with desi I love this
foundation so much it's just it makes
you look so Photoshop Lee pretty I mixed
it today with the Maybelline fit me
foundation in matte poreless this is 110
this I also got at Ulta and these two
together are so fabulous so amazing I'm
wearing this combo my face today and our
local beach I got the Kevyn Aucoin
sensual skin enhancer because I've heard
very great things about it plus I also
got this lipstick by Kevin a Quan I'm
wearing it out my lips today this is the
color evermore I showed this on snapchat
but this is evermore and it's just such
an amazing nude for fair people
like me it's just it's nude but not too
much you can't wear it on its own
because it's a little bit too light then
but if you pair it with like NYX natural
lip pencil yes like yes this all over
your mouth
also by Kevin O'Connor I got this loose
shimmer eyeshadow Bowl ball rollerball
magic stop thingy this is the color cons
ight probably Richard that I'm sorry
it's like an understated very glamorous
look it's like it gives you a pow of
glamour but it's still not too much and
it just it makes your eyeballs look very
understated Lee glaber's I got pretty
much every color of the NYX liquid suede
liquid lipsticks um
because Kim was wearing the red one it
might be this one Kim was wearing the
red one to dinner on our first night
when we arrived and I fell in love with
that lip color
plus we pizza and her lipstick stayed on
like a dream so I was sold and needed
all their colors and Kim actually gifted
me these so Kim thank you so much honey
I love the colors and I can't wait to
play with them I got another Bowl on
tumor I should have by NYX this is
called walnut and I really got this
because the color is just so damn sexy
do another Bowl on shimmer this is in
the color light blue it kind of looks
like my lip color today but it's not
that so don't be fooled the Knicks the
Knicks prismatic eyeshadows really spoke
to me because I love girl talk to
highlight my face with so I got a couple
more this one right here is called smoke
and mirrors which is a nice shimmering
black gray fireball which is just so
warm and so me and mermaid and mermaid
is just so amazing I cannot wait to do
like a Halloween look with this it's so
cool I got a bunch of the NYX studio
liquid eyeliners and it got three shades
of blue a bright one a darker one and a
lighter one I'm obsessed with these I'm
wearing the lighter one underneath all
the blueness today I really really like
these then it did some damage at Urban
Decay and I as you know I am freaking
obsessed with their heavy metal
with airliners I freaked out over the
gold one I have the pink and the darker
blue one I guess and so I made it a
mission to get all the other colors I
didn't have yet at any Urban Decay
counter or store or whatever so right
around our hotel there was Fashion
Island and they had an Urban Decay store
so I'm a little bit ham I got all the
remaining colors I didn't have yet I got
amp which I have is a glitter over my
lids
today I got distortion which I've been
wearing in LA so much Plus this is also
the glitter that I put over top in my
get ready with me with desi video and I
got the silver and the silver is on
another level I love the silver so much
I love to having a glitter slate or when
a cake if you love glitter get on this I
also made my custom palette at Urban
Decay I love this package and I chose
these four colors right here I don't
remember the names I do know that one of
the girls who worked there had this
color here in her inner corners and it
was life and I'm probably going to copy
that look and give her credit
and because splitter liners aren't
enough I also got the loose glitters
these are three glitters by Urban Decay
this one is gold mine and the girl who
worked there had a gold mine on her on
the center of her lid and then the pinky
tone on the unicorn it was just so
original and I really want to try it
pyrotechnics glitter and a loaded
glitter - new Stila magnificent metals
eyeshadows this is metallic pixie dust
and Comex gold can't wait can't wait I
got some more makeup forever stuff I got
this powder right here which is the
velvet finished powder and number 25 and
this is green tinted and I want to use
this for days where I had a little bit
more redness on my face as I get a
little bit red on the tops of my
cheekbones so whenever that rips tends
to shine through a little bit too much I
would just dust this over top a little
bit I did it in LA
when it got a little bit of red here
from my procedure check out my Instagram
if you want to know what I'm talking
about but I got a little bit red from
that procedure so I put this over top
and it just magically went away I also
got this bronzer this is the velvet
finish powder bronzer in number five
this is such an amazing bronzer I'm
wearing it as a bronzer today I really
love how its warm and a little bit of
orangie but not too much and it was kind
of time for me to you know walk away
from the Park Avenue princess palette by
Tarte so it feels good to wear a new
bronzer for one and then also I got this
this is the pro sculpting duo in Union
and I don't know number one number one I
haven't used this yet because the
bronzer kind of intimidates me and the
highlighter kind of highlighter never
intimidates me I don't know why I'm not
bandits yet oh that is gorgeous oh I
will shoot okay I'm right the
highlighter today Kim made me buy the
Mario Badescu um facial spray rose water
haven't tried to get supposed to be
great I stocked up on my Ardell whispies
and my are down 113 s I'm wearing the
whispies today and I love the whispies
because they give you a lash but you can
still see what's going on on the lids
and with my eye shape when I put false
lashes on it's false eyelashes and a
bottom lash color and that's a look so
every time I blink you will see like
this hint of color when I look down so
with the whispies you can actually still
see what is going on on my eyes on my
eyeballs which is good oh I got the
japonesque 915 brush because does II of
course of course MLS and at least I
really want to show you the Too Faced
melted chocolates these are six new
melted lipsticks and they're all in the
chocolate line they smell like chocolate
they look like chocolate colors it got
like three glosses and three matte ones
and my favorites are the darkest one
because it's so vampy so sexy this is
called chocolate cherries a lot of girls
at the event were obsessing over
chocolate milkshake
and a lot of girls were wearing it um so
and it looked good on so many I haven't
tried it yet so good so I really really
do love the new Too Faced melted
chocolate line go check it out go show
them support to your face is such an
amazing company and they're not paying
me to say this I'm just once you get to
know the people behind the brand you
