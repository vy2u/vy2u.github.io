showing you my may hit Sunnah God knows
I've gathered up a list of super super
cool products to show you this month and
I'm so excited they have changed my life
this month and we're going to do it
alright the first product I want to talk
about and I've already talked about this
in my Kylie Jenner makeup tutorial but I
have to do it again this is the flawless
lighting calm selfie ring light this is
a super difficult device that you clamp
on to your phone like that so easy and
then right here at the top it has a
button and then once you press it it
goes one light two light three super
bright so I've been using the selfie
ring light by flawless lighting for all
my selfies lately for my snapchat
stories where I swatch products for my
snapchat stories where I show you new
products it's just to give it a really
beautiful light I am so madly in love
with this when I'm out of light I use
this to guide me around through the dark
I use this for my selfies for product
shots for snapchat stories I pretty much
use it for everything and when I talked
about it on my snapchat a lot of people
wanted a discount code for it so I
teamed up with flawless eye ting at
selfie lighting on Instagram and if you
use code Nicki at checkout you will save
some money on this amazingness I know
they're coming out with more colors
right now this is charged by batteries
but I know they're coming out with a
rechargeable one I think this is a next
product I really want to talk about is
the beauty killer palette by Jeffrey
star now I just filmed a tutorial with
it and what is on my eyes right now is
the Jeffrey star beauty killer I should
have held which a tutorial for this
makeup look will be going up in two days
on Sunday on my channel featuring this
palette or a backstory when I visited
Jeffrey for the 5 minute makeup
challenge a couple months ago he showed
me this he let me play with the palette
he let me swatch the palette and right
then and there I fell in love with it
because the beauty killer I should
appellate features 10 beautiful unique
amazing eyeshadows and each and every
eyeshadow is super pigmented super
buttery easy to work with
unique but
versatile enough to create natural looks
or very outgoing makeup looks
I think this palette is amazing I live
for Jeffrey I lived every so much and I
think he annealed his first I should
have palette and I cannot wait for more
um while we're talking about Jeffrey
star his new skin frost highlighters I
used this combination right here in my
previous videos well my Kylie Jenner
video and I used peach goddess which
looks like this and I love this for my
fair skin tone to perk up and illuminate
my blush so from my blush I go up to my
glowing area and this will really livin
up any blush you have now of course if
you're more tan or deep of color this is
a beautiful highlighter for you but for
me it's too dark to wear as a
highlighter alone although it comes very
close to not being too dark but my
all-time favorite eyes cold now again
when Jeffrey showed me his I should have
Hallett he also showed me these and this
was the first color my eyes went to kiss
of course I'm pale and pasty I am
see-through and to see that Jeffrey
created a highlighter light enough for
my pasty ass
I wanted to lick his balls right there I
think ice cold is the perfect
highlighter for anyone out there who
loves a dramatic glow for any pill
people out there who need a glow that
actually shows up on their skin the
formula on these highlighters can we
talk about they are super super buttery
pigmented and intense but still we use a
very light hand they go on super natural
and luminous and just beautiful and I
think Jeffrey star now has upgraded
himself from liquid lipstick off to
highlighter God and I should have hello
God
alright might as well get every Jeffrey
star product out there while we're added
druglord
liquid lipstick now this color I've had
for a long while and never really looked
at it and shame on me so a couple of
weeks ago I got this amazing liquid
lipstick by another brand but I felt
like it was a little too severe and
harsh on me so I wanted to lighten it
and I was like well if I mix it with any
other nude liquid lipstick it will make
it too nude I just want to lighten this
I simply doused a little
druglord all over the center of my lips
blended it in with a brush and it
created this amazing nude voluptuous
liquid lipstick nice I also did it with
my lips today I'm wearing different ours
I'm nude a velour liquid lipstick but
over top druglord and that just makes it
a little bit more nude and interesting
and funky and different and I write the
next product I really want to talk about
is by morphe morphe recently came out
with a brand spankin new eyeshadow
palette and it's this one right here
this is the 35 FS as the mother fucka
this is fabulous this palette right here
has amazing gorgeous high shine
beautiful memorising eyeshadow colors
but the bottom row right here is all
mattes and that makes it one of the best
eyeshadow palettes out there because
it's versatile because you can wear
shimmers on shimmers on shimmers but
still have that row of gnats to perfect
the look I've shown this on my snapchat
quite a lot because I'm highly obsessed
with this is actually my second palette
I have two of these because I needed a
backup just in case this shade right
here baby
I am wildly obsessed with the 35f pellet
for neutral glamorous warm smoky eyes or
whenever you just want a really
luxurious I make up this got you covered
alright more eyeshadows one of my
favourite liquid lipstick brands colored
brain came out with shadows this is
their entire new range of eyeshadows and
I think they did a great job in coming
up with neutrals highlighters and funky
bright colors I think it's a perfect mix
now a couple of my favorites by far by
far
clutch pearls this is like Mac's vanilla
pigment on steroids and super duper more
pigmented it's just
hello pigmentation it's hello beautiful
shine you can use this as a highlighter
this is gorgeous as an inner corner
highlighter brow bone highlighter all
over body highlighter I love love clutch
pearls another favorite is superstar
superstar is so luxurious bright gold
and
amazing and look at the pigmentation you
guys pretty much every eyeshadow they
came out with is super super pigmented
buttery again easy to work with and just
just fun these are fun colors to play
around with and they're affordable
they're beautiful the pigmentation hello
so I highly highly recommend the color
brain eyeshadows as well it's been a lot
of game changing eyeshadows lately oh
another favorite has been my new tattoo
I got eyelashes tattooed on my wrist
because you know the glam life will
never stop and I'm addicted to the glam
and I'm addicted to falsies and so I'm
gonna them permanently on my body
alright this month was also the month I
finally rolled into Lilly lashes I've
heard such amazing amazing things on
Lilly lashes but never really got around
to getting any of them so then I got
them and I'm obsessed so I ordered a
couple more sales on snapchat yesterday
but I'm gonna show you some of my
all-time favorites so far the ones I'm
wearing today are called tease these are
the Lily lashes in teeth then in my
previous video in my Kylie dinner video
I used a favorite pair called opulence
and opulence are so natural flirty and
wispy and long they kind of look like
eyelash extensions
you know eyelash extensions but more
beautiful and better and you can take
them off at night but my all-time
favorites by Lily lashes are caramel or
caramel these are not caramel or caramel
caramel these right here are so full
intense and dramatic but so good like
these don't make your eyes look sexy AF
these will make you feel like you can
take on the world with your sexy eye
lashes and you can blink the haters away
so I really love the Lily lashes and I
highly recommend them also everything so
far is highly recommendable oh quickly a
brush I fallen in love with this month
is by morphe this is the 504 brush M 504
brush if you're looking for a super nice
blendable crease brush
baby stop it right there is fluffy yet
concentrated enough to Packer Creason
and give a definition but so fluffy
enough to blow it out and smoke it out
and blend it out there isn't really a
whole lot I can see about this I'm
thinking about doing a morphe favorites
brush video just a morphe in general
favorites video because everyone is
always asking me what my favorite more
few products are but so far I can
already tell you that the M 504 brush is
a must-have I know I often address
having very dry skin lately in my hit's
and God knows and I'm always looking for
that perfect product to get rid of the
dryness and soak me up in moisture so
this has been a very long journey and at
the end of the journey I was like why
was I never so dry before what changed
what made my skin so dry so I figured
why not go back to my old skincare
favorites and see if it changes anything
so I tried a couple of things and it
didn't really work until I went back to
my all-time favorite Hana remodeling
cream if you've been a subscriber of
mine for a long long time you know that
the remodeling cream has been one of my
all-time favorites for so long now and I
don't know why but I stopped using it
for about a year and in that year all
moisture left my face so in the
beginning of this month I started using
remodeling cream again and I'm back to
being my old nourished
well moisturize self and I'm so glad
that I finally went back through this
one it just lifts your skin and
nourishes it and moisturizes it and it
couldn't be more obsessed and I highly
highly recommend this alright last but
not least it's no secret that I have
gotten new veneers oh I got my veneers
done by dr. app'
my favorite dentist ever in Dubai and
he's also in New York City dr. Abba is
first of all a very handsome dentist he
knows very well what he's doing he's so
so good he is I think one of those few
dentists that can make veneers would
make him look super super natural and
trust me it's hard out there to find
Dennis they can do veneers that look
like your own teeth instead of put in so
when I met him he was talking about
coming out with this own line and he
told me all about his new products and
he gave me some to try at home
the first product I want to talk about
is this right here this right here is
tooth gloss now I never knew this but
apparently at pageants or like
photoshoots they used to put vaseline on
the teeth to make a more shiny and more
good-looking I was like oh really I'm
gonna start doing that he was accepted
right there you don't have to use
Vaseline anymore he came out with the
tooth gloss which is so much better than
putting Vaseline on your teeth this is a
shiny this is a high shine clear gloss
specially made for your teeth so if you
have a photo shoot or you have to get
your photo taken for like your passport
school whatever and you can smile and
you can smell passports well if there's
a photo and you want your teeth to be on
fleek there's this tooth gloss you
squirts them out right there
and all you do is on top of the teeth
and it has a very nice fresh minty taste
and look how shiny my top teeth are
right now so for the last month when I
do my videos and I smile in the intro
and my teeth look very blingy that's
because I have the two clasp on and it
just stays on for a little bit and it
just makes your teeth look amazing and
beautiful and that's what I've been
applying in my intros and posing shots
for all my videos lately so yeah that is
just something I quickly wanted to throw
in my hits this month because dr. APIs
so amazing and his line is amazing his
work is amazing
and I wanted to give him some love I
shown these products to you because I
think they Rock we're there that were
all my hits for the month of May and
let's see worth my oh god oh
uh no sadly enough don't kill me I again
don't have an oh god no it's not that
I'm afraid to bash on products it's just
this month so many amazing perfect
products came out and that's all my mind
has been thinking of and I haven't
really encountered a bad product this

lot of tea to spill so that's it guys

beauty killer makeup tutorial I hope to

inspired by Kylie Jenner so Kylie is
coming out with a new metal matte lip
kit called majesty and I saw some posts
of it online and I think that color is
so edgy so different and so beautiful
but it isn't out yet so in this tutorial
I kind of made my do-it-yourself metal
matte lip kit and I was inspired by her
makeup look right here where she's
wearing the lip kit and I like this
because all the attention goes to these
beautiful lips and the eyes are super
flirty and still natural so if you've
been wanting a natural look from me
there you go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
