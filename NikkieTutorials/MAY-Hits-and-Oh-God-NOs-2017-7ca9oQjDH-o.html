when she has her cold I'm not going to
sing for you it is me Scarlett Johansson
Ivy from Gossip Girl in my last video so
many of you commented that I reminded
you of all these celebrities I just
named and all because of this lovely
strep throat that I had a couple of
weeks ago now because I was gone for a
little bit here on the tube and I'm
finally back I am going to break the
record for chewing my hips and God knows
the farthest into a month ever
here are my April 2 kind of God go this
is going to be more of like a chitchat
video I want to talk to you guys I want
to I miss you guys so much and I'm just
going to show you some products God did
it for me in the last couple of weeks
and the products that all right the
first product I'm going to start off
with is I went thank you from the bottom
of my heart for all your love and
support for my collaboration with Oprah
I know a lot of people are like she's
talking about the dam collapse again
when you get the opportunity to work
with one of your favorite brands to
create products that you truly believe
and love why would you talk about them
so from the bottom of my heart I want to
thank each and every one of you for
buying that ever glow for buying mystery
liquid lipsticks eliza set for buying it
individually the launch has been so so
amazing and all i can do is thank you
it is so incredible to me that I have
this little family here on YouTube and
like we obsess over the same stuff when
we see highlighter we go crazy what we
see glitter we lose our minds and it
feels so good to know that I have to
secure a place on the internet with
people that love me and support me and
usually in these last couple of weeks
your guys's tweets messages saying that
you miss me while I was gone it truly
meant so much your love and support will
never go unnoticed
and thank so if you didn't oh yeah my
collaboration with alpha is now
available individually the launch is
going really really well you have to nag
a little ever glow if you like the glow
that you're seeing on your mother right
back on track your mother if you're
liking slow is everyone the second thing
I really want to thank you for its this
thanks to all of you I won the shorty
award for best YouTube guru in New York
City is where the worst were hosted and
I got invited I've EV KP I'm a GG
gorgeous I met Nev from catfish I was
like watch pod TV it was such an
incredible and fun night and I literally
I went there I was so unprepared I
pretty much decided my mind I'm not
going because I really wanted to cut
back on traveling because we're really
taking a toll on my health and like got
my hopes up and then I coincidence
Ric and I'd look like a little mini
vacation to get like tattoos and like I
got a college piercing out an order
which was a Michigan of so obsessed with
it we went there to tential get tattoos
and like you know enjoy each other and
like enjoy New York beast I Love New
York
and then without even thinking about it
I found out that the ceremony for the
awards was in that trip so I just ended
up going I have to worse luck buying my
red carpet outfit I kind of really
insecure when it comes to my body so red
carpets are something I avoid at all
cost because just not me and like I
don't feel comfortable at all so when I
decided that I was going to go to the
show I was like what the hell thing in
there where so I spent five hours in
advance to the show of finding something
to wear and then goddess I tried dresses
I tried it all and thank God I found
this top that I really really liked and
so I wore that I brought the Mamas out
they were out as so many of you were
like I didn't know you have tells so I
went to the award show and I just sat
down there met all these amazing people
when it came to my category desi and KB
were the ones and necklacing the winner
and they called my name and in that like
in my mind I went look so I had to walk
over to the stage and do a speech and I
was run by emotions and I was like
excited out of my mind and they handed
me over this beautiful thing but here
and you know I just did my speech and
walking out I felt like walking on
frickin cloud 27 it is a moment I will
never forget in my life and it is by far
it's not my favorite thing of the month
let's say me of the year it means so
much I mean we this you voted for me I
won because of you and this is crazy so
thank you again all right so let's go
over to some makeup products that I
really want to share with you first up
is the Sigma Beauty Blender sponge this
is called the 3d HD Blender sponge this
isn't and as you can see it has straight
edges it has a nice little flat but it's
got a rounder edge it's a beautiful
sponge and this has been my go-to sponge
just a density and softness of the
sponge is something I am really really
addicted to and I set it in previous
videos like forever ago this sponge is a
little softer than regular Beauty
Blender and once you get used to the
softness I like the texture of this
plunge it's really hard to go back to
the Beauty Blender because the Beauty
Blender soaks up a little bit more
products it's a little bit and it's hard
to believe it's a little bit more rough
on the skin so this is completely won my
heart over I cannot live without it my
only thing that I hate about it and I so
agree with you guys it is so soft that
when I wash it and I like force the
water out sometimes as you can see
little snips
tear off and that is not a good thing so
maybe this is something Sigma kill look
into but it is so delicate that when you
wash it sometimes little just want to
tap for a longer time now so I'm okay
with it because I've had it for so long
the legs do
you know gotta put that up I'm also
realizing right now that I'm going to be
the beauty guru recommends three
highlighters to newspapers so here we go
we're really liking just my benefit this
is called dandelion twinkles
when this came out I laughed at benefit
they were like it's so beautiful like
it's a glow you've never seen before and
then when I tried it I was like funny
that is not that is not mine at all
unless you are one of the four natural
boys or girls out there that like you
know a softer grill it's okay still
lucky but what I really like dandelion
twinkle for is strobing the forehead
like I said in my previous video
something that is so popular right now
is a stroked forehead and with this it
has that perfect amount of shine that
gives you that healthy look but nothing
too overpowering or too much so I
strobed
my forehead with this above the arch of
the brows and in the center of the
forehead and it just makes you look a
little more human it just makes you look
a little bit more real which in my case
I need so dandelion twinkle is soft and
silent on its own but amazing as a
stroller on the forehead alright another
highlighter I know it's a problem at
this point this is by wet and wild this
is so good this is called the mega glow
highlighting powder in the color the
sweet is bling and this precious little
baby looks like this you use the Dutch
shine okay so let me swatch for you one
two three boom of luma bloom of boobs
like seriously
pour this highlighter is so incredible
plus it is drugstore I know this has
been out for a little bit and I know
it's limited edition so to look finding
it but like once you find it wants to
hear your hands on it it's a maze well
to stand on all day long
it has a nice pinky Cromie feel to it
this is what you have to check out
something else I've been loving are the
anasazi Beverly Hills blush trios and
let me tell you these are so crazy
payments of when we look at this orange
e peachy shade will
two three boom-boom-boom-boom
these are super super pigmented so you
only need a tiny tiny bit and I just
love the color selection this is great
for your peach days you got a little bit
of your contour shade you got a pink you
get a peachy neutral it's got them all
so these two are my favorites this one
is called peachy loves and this one is
called pool party
they are great quality but no one can
suds Rivoli hills that are a little bit
more expensive so definitely if you want
to invest in a really pigmented high-end
blushes I recommend you looking into
these tomograph toothbrush this brush
Patrick star you are a legend he talked
about this brush in one of his tutorials
this right here is the sigma e55 like
she said so far has been the most
perfect brush for the lower lash line
it's the perfect like with like cooked
girl I've got like the perfect density
with the perfect size to get up
underneath there and get enough like
smoke but it's not going overboard and
like for you to do back in the day
actually two weeks ago this brush has
been so good for the lower lash line I'm
obsessed every time I get to my lower
lash and I'm like so excited to grab
this brush and dip it into my shadow and
like go down this brush has been doing
it for me so I highly recommend you
checking it out it's great so I think
those are the products that really stood
out to me his last couple of weeks some
likes and when did I wear make sure like
before my body went to this is what
really did it for me
and yeah I wish there was more but
there's not so that in further ado let's
spill the tea on the products that
weren't doing it for me oh yeah no all
right my first oh god no and I briefly
touched this subject in the previous it
synagogue knows Kylie cosmetics
highlighters you know to each their own
just like with the dandelion twinkle
people some people prefer a softer glow
and there's nothing wrong with
but when it comes to me personally I'm
not here for it the Kyrie highlighters
aren't bad just don't get me wrong kids
like 1 2 3 they are bad there's
definitely a shine but like I expected a
little bit more and especially for the
pride you know I ordered these myself so
for all of you saying but you know
kindly sponsors you went get it real
with you Kylie does not need to sponsor
B she's got enough in a support of her
own I I was just a little disappointed
once they came in I were Mike once or
twice they didn't capture my heart so I
let go of him
so you asked me are they worth the buck
I saved him girl neuro and my last oh
god no of the month and this is going to
come as a shock because so many people
love it
do your for ever punish this stuff here
has betrayed me you know so many people
love it Chris coverage is long wearing
capabilities like it stays on and makes
your skin look amazing but every time I
wear this and I'm wearing it today
because I wanted to give it a last shot
it oxidizes like an open-loop on me this
is in the shade oh 10 it looks like a
thousand on me like I become or plus
what I don't like about this foundation
is that it enhances my pores I don't get
better with any foundation like you know
I'm pretty okay with my skin at the
moment but like pores isn't something
that lets who really have to like focus
on when I wear this I'm like where'd
these come from so I know a lot of
people love this and that's great for
them but missed the mark for me that was
the guys those were my hips and God
knows what were yours let me know in the
conversational if you're wondering what
is on my lips before I get any comments
morphe liquid lipstick and jealousy so
for a full list of every single product
mentioned go to my description box below
I just wanted to quickly tell you that a
lot of you have been telling me that you
don't get notifications when I upload
anymore and it's because YouTube changed
its algorithm for
ah treason even when you're subscribed
to someone YouTube thinks it's okay to
not let everyone know there's really
nothing I can do about it all I can tell
you is had somewhere in the screen
there's a little bell when you click
that you get a notification for every
time I post the video so I just want to
put that up there because a lot of
people were like I missed like four
videos and like you were gone and and
it's probably because YouTube decided to
just not tell you that I uploaded so if
you click spell it will give you a
notification every time I'm here as
always if you enjoyed watching this
video of course I forget to give any
thumbs up and subscribe to my channel
and I can't wait to see you on the next
one hi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
