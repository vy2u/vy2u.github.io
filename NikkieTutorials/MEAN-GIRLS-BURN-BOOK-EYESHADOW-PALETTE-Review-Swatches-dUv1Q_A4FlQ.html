be back on my channel to show you the
following I'm so excited
it's not even October 3rd plus it's not
even a Wednesday should upload it this
on Wednesday today I am doing a playtime
video on the new storybook cosmetics
burn book by the Mean Girls movie and
first of all round of applause to you
storybook cosmetics for actually doing
this for actually pulling through and
doing this and getting all the rights
and just creating pure and utter magic
for us stands out here I've always been
obsessed with Mean Girls like the first
time I saw it I was like what where's
this movie going what it's gonna happen
but at the end of it I was so obsessed I
think I've watched it like 12 times by
now and just again storybook you did the
damn thing you pull through you came
through you are here for the stands and
I'm so this right here is the storybook
cosmetics burn book Mean Girls eyeshadow
palette and it comes with 12 very
colorful and fun eyes shadow 's and the
names can we talk about it in just a few
is butter a carb Glenn Cocco you go Glen
Coco of course so fetch she doesn't even
go here the plastics Regina George Mouse
duh this palette is speaking to me on so
many levels like this palette reaches
levels on the inside of my body and it
tingles Dan today's video I'm just gonna
be playing with the burn book I'm so
excited I'm gonna be playing with
Wednesday just mmm I have a look in mind
but knowing me with all these playing
time videos it turns out way different
so sit back relax and let's play with
makeup let's see how the shadows look on
the eye
do they have any fallout how's the
pigmentation let's find out more about
the shadows in a nice little playtime
video I'm ready I'm sorry the first
color I'm gonna go in with is Wednesday
and Wednesday is going into the crease
and onto the outer third of the lid and
this color is so pigmented and so
intense you want to go a little bit
little because you pick up a little bit
and you're on
now with a clean brush I'm slightly
buffing up the edges and now we're going
to move into so fetch and this is going
to go right above a Wednesday into the
crease so right above it like a little
sunrise happening over here or sunset it
looks more like a sunset honestly and
then back in with the clean blending
brush to again buff out the edges once
you're happy with your blend in your
shape it's now time to cut the crease or
cut the lid and for this I'm going in
with my trusty Mac select cover-up
concealer and as I'm cutting the crease
I just want to mention how impressed I
am by the pigmentation on these shadows
they have so much color payoff they
blend so easily and so quickly so far
I'm a huge huge fan now going in with
the white shadow of the palette the
plastics on the inner third of the lid
and I'm liking this white is that the
most pigmented white I've ever tried
no because taco by sugarpill is more
intense and has more color payoff but
still it's a pretty white now going back
in with the orange so fetch going on the
center of where the white and the pink
meet
now if you're thinking Nikki that blend
is looking a little bit rough my number
one trick to make anything look blended
and nice is to put a shimmer over top of
where the colors meet so go and with
Regina George and this is going over so
fetch to make it blended baby so that is
it for the top lid this oh my god
this makes me so happy it looks so hard
to do that is not alright lower lashline
time and I'm gonna make it smoky and
deep so I'm gonna go in with she doesn't
even go here and this honestly might be
one of my favorite shades of the entire
palette because it's so rich and warm
but deep this for fall is everything
applying some black liner to my
waterline to make it even more smoky and
this is these.you a slim cream liner and
matte black and buffing out the outer
edge using so Fitch
again okay time to finish I'm gonna go
in with these velour lashes in imagined
and these come with a glittery black
band so it looks like you're wearing
black glitter liner but you're not cuz
this on your lashes so that's a nice
little touch for with this look so
imagine is going on the eyeballs
all right so eyes are done let's finish
this look I'm gonna bronze because I'm
looking like a ghost and if your ghost
you can't be part of the plastics a true
plastic is also carved into perfection
I'm contouring for flesh and going in
with this pretty one by Ofra this is
called my tie one of my all-time
favorites and something I've been doing
is carving up my cheeks as well it's
gonna make you look extra extra plastic
we're just my philosophy in life look
extra plastic now that you're Santa it's
time to glow and I'm gonna be mixing a
couple of products today I'm gonna go
for the I watched dezzy's ultimate glow
video and I I just learned so much from
that that I just want to play with the
glow today so I'm gonna go in with this
one right here this is benefits
dandelion twinkle I love this as a
strober and of course this is well loved
my glazed donut highlight in
collaboration with Ofra it is still
available so I'm going to mix those two
for on the cheekbones
now for some extra glow this Pop Lux
highlighter in the color double life and
this is more of like a blush color and
desease trick was to give it a smile and
really put it on the apples of the
cheeks like Chrissy Teigen so doing it
oh I look like plastic and I love it
let's do some more strobing using the
dandelion twang cow and hello this is a
good day mm-hmm I fit right in with the
plastics literally I am made of play-doh
for lips I'm gonna go in with this
Anasazi Beverly Hills - liquid lipstick
in the colour trouble
some settings rate to set it all and
we're done and that guys concludes my
playtime video using the storybook
cosmetics burn book Mean Girls I shoulda
palette if you ask me I think this is a
must-have the shadows are incredibly
pigmented they apply like a dream they
are so full full full of color
they blend easily I didn't notice any
extreme fallout on my skin I did notice
some build up in the pan so when you dip
your brush in a BH subculture palette a
little bit of that but way less
definitely with Wednesday with so fetch
a tiny bit less and all the others I did
not experience that with so if you are
afraid of buildup in the pan or you're
so against it it usually it happens
because shadows are still pigmented and
they have so much pigment in them which
makes them a little bit more powdery so
it's kind of something you want to have
to live with if you want a super
pigmented shadow that blends like a
dream you're gonna have a little bit of
build up in the palette itself it's
nothing like a BH subculture it is
nothing extreme but it did happen with
Wednesday a little bit more than with
the others the palette retails for $55
and for $55 you get a burn book that has
amazing packaging and twelve really
high-quality shadows and if you ask me
it's so worth it it is a little bit of
an investment but again I think it's so
worth it if you love me and girls you
need this in your life if you love the
colors that are in this palette you need
this in your life if these colors are
nothing that satisfy your needs don't
skip it's all personal preference with
all palettes out there my personal
preference says yes yes yes but at the
end of the day you decide if you think
it's worth the money so let me know in
the comment below we think of this
palette do you want it are you gonna buy
