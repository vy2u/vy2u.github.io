movie theaters to see the new minions
movie and I absolutely loved it seeing
all these yellow babies inspired me to
come up with a yellow look it's a yellow
cut crease and I thought this would be
perfect for if you're going to the movie
theaters to see the movie the minions or
if you just want to feel like you have
two minions on your eyeballs it's just
the look to celebrate that the new
minions movie is out in theaters I
absolutely love the movie I highly
recommend you checking it out because it
is so funny and Bob is life yeah without
any further ado if you would like to
know how to get this yellow minion
inspired look right here then keep on
watching the first thing I'll be doing
is applying a base to my lids to prevent
everything from creasing and for this
I'm using my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot
and for this I'm using a zoeva 142
concealer buffer brush as my transition
shade today I'll be going in with makeup
geek desert sands eyeshadow and with the
makeup geek defined crease brush I'm
softly cutting my crease
and then once you reach the outer corner
then slightly winged it out now with the
morphe m4 33 i'm just blending that
crease out even more now going in with
the Stila eyes are the window mind
pellet and I'm taking the colored
creativity and with a zueva 3:17 and
just lightly cutting the crease even
more
then mixing back color from the Stila
pallid and desert sands together and
that will be my blending color for the
lid as the base I'll be using the
Anastasia Beverly Hills cream color
waterproof liner and this is in the
color yellow and paint this all the way
up to the line of the cut crease and
therefore it can make it even more crisp
and clean and going straight over top
using sugar pills butter cupcake
the now it's time for the winged liner
and for this I'll first go in with my
Kevin eat a two liner in trooper to make
my outline and fill in using my NYC
black liquid liner
for my lower lashline I'll be using
makeup geeks mocha eyeshadow and with my
Mac 228 I'm just buffing this on the
outer corners and for my inner corners
I'm taking a shimmering white eyeshadow
from one of my morphe palettes and
lighting up my inner corners on the
waterline I'm applying NYX jumbo pencil
in milk to open up my eyes now lastly
I'm taking this nyx white liquid liner
and i'm drawing in the super tiny white
line right on the inner corners and this
will optically make your eyes look
larger now I'm going to apply some
mascara to top and lower lashes and then
finish with falsies and the falsies of
using today are these new ones by house
of lashes and these are called boudoir
okay for cheeks first I like to do some
bronzing so I'm going in with my Mac
give me Sun extra dimension skin finish
and the makeup studio so1 brush
then I'm going to intensify the contour
using the cavity shade and light palette
and for this I'll take this color right
here and mix it with this and the brush
I'll be using for this is the Mac 168
for highlighter I'll be using mary lou
manizer by the balm
for a touch of blush I'm taking my
golden hi by Guerlain for lifts I'm
first going to line my lips with this
L'Oreal infallible lip liner in always
toasted which is number 708 nice name
the front lipstick I'm going to take
