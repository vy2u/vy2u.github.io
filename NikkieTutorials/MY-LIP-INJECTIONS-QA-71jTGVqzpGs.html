fun to do a lip injections slash lip
fillers cue a question and answer video
because ever since I've gotten redone
I've been getting a lot of questions and
comments on them so I thought why not
address it and instead of me blabbing
for about 20 minutes about my lips and
how it hurts and what it did I thought
on snapchat I'm gonna ask you to send in
your questions with a video and then I
can really personally answer any of your
questions this way I feel like I'm
really answering your questions and not
just my thoughts on what you probably
will ask me so that any further ado if
you do not follow me on snapchat my
screen name is Nikki tutorial so you can
follow me there but let's go on to the
first question about my lips okay of
your zero so personally I can handle a
lot of pain so what maybe like a five to
me can be like a nine to others it
honestly really depends how much you can
tolerate pain but for me the pain from a
one to ten is about a six to seven the
only thing that really hurts is you feel
the needle going in you get numbing
cream before but you feel the needle
going in and then the lip filler itself
has numbing in it as well so once the
needle goes in and the filling goes in
you won't feel a thing anymore
but it's just that entrance of the
needle into your lips is what you feel
it kind of feels like someone really
hardcore is pinching your lips it's like
they take a little piece of skin in
between your nails and then just really
pinch it really hard that is kind of
what it feels like in my opinion say it
from a 1 to 10 for me it will probably
like a 7 or 6 my question would be how
much do they cost
and like how long will it last
have you even had any bad side effects
also I love your videos love your eyes
thank you so much lip fillers are not
cheap the very first time I got my lips
done I paid I think in total 399 euros
but I do not go to the place anymore
I saw the clinic that I went to this
time it costs me 299 but I have a little
special story um my doctor had to kind
of you know kind of fix the mistakes of
my first appointment she had to go in
with a second tube of filling so it
costs me a little bit more but for one
like tuba filler normally you pay around
299 or 399 euros I know it's not cheap
but I'm willing to pay for that if I
know they're going to do a good job I'd
rather pay 299 euros and get perfect
lips or pay 60 euros and go home like a
monster and as for how long they last it
also really depends on your body how
fast it kind of breaks down the products
in your lips usually normally the first
time you get lip fillers it will go
about three to six months but the more
filler you get after the longer it will
stay in so this batch call them ellipse
batch now so this batch will last for
about six to eight months and if I do it
again after those six to eight months it
will probably last from eight to ten and
from ten to a year but the max is always
a year they will never last longer than
a year which is a good thing because if
you do not like them your body will take
away the filler and you'll be back to
normal after about a couple of months if
it's your first time
normal shape so as I said they will
definitely go back to normal this is not
permanent or whatsoever what they fill
your lips with is actually here you'll
hear a little ironic assic acid do this
yellow Roenick acid and hyaluronic acid
is the body can break it down so it's
not permanent if you do not like it just
do
not go back and get a refill let your
body break it hi Nikki how and where did
you get the lip injections on your lip
so a little story you should know is
that the first time I got my lips done I
was so so disappointed I was not happy
with them at all because my doctor
begged then she kind of created these
little flops here and I felt so
conscious about them and I I was kind of
ashamed of my lips by then then the
search for a new doctor came to be I had
to find someone to fix my previous
doctors mistakes which I luckily did I
found Whitney qui Minh at faith glance
in ain't OVA and she is amazingly sweet
she's so good she's amazing with the
needle and she's so talented and she
basically transformed my list into the
lips I always wanted from the get-go
either way because she had to fix a
little bit more of my previous
appointment she went in all over the top
lip she went in on the sides to kind of
heightened up the sides of the lip she
also went directly into the pigmented
portion of my lips
so right where your actual lips are to
give a more plumpness and then also on
the bottom lip I asked her to make it a
little bit more full because I really
like the way that looks so she added a
little bit all throughout the center of
my bottom lip but nothing on the sides
of my bottom lip so basically all of the
top lip and also on the sides to kind of
push it outwards and then on the center
of my bottom lip I have a lip stone
because the sides of my top lip always
would curl inwards and then the center
of my top lip would just be normal and
fine so it would always look weird
because the center of the top loop was
normal and then they would fall down
droop in and then this full bottom lip
it just looked weird but the way my lips
are right now is definitely the way I
want to keep them because these are the
lips that I imagined
and dreamed of having from the get-go
from the beginning so no I'm not going
bigger hey Nikki um my question is how
what did your boyfriend say about your
lip injections was he supported was he
looking okay
I love that question actually so Rick
the first time I got him done he was
like I like them but I kind of see the
flops too
I don't know if I should talk about that
so he was okay with my lips when I first
got them done but the second time around
this time around he loves them so
basically the day after the procedure
your lips get super super swollen and
they get the biggest they can and so
when he kissed me
good morning he was like wow that was
like kissing another woman love you too
um yes absolutely I will get more lip
fillers as you start to wear down again
so I will not get lip fillers to get
bigger than this because this is fine
with me but once these start wearing out
again I'm definitely getting more so
definitely the worst thing about getting
lip fillers is the bruising and the
swelling the needles themselves they're
not that bad but the day after or just a
couple of hours after the procedure you
get bruised you get swollen it just
becomes this big mess and you look crazy
like your lips will look even crazier
than Lisa Rinna so after the procedure
your lips start to swell and if you
bruise easily you will get bruises I got
bruised really bad this time I
definitely want to stress that this is
not a pretty procedure this is not like
a lunchbreak procedure if you get your
lips done you really need a couple of
days off from your work a couple of days
after you will swell you will get
bruised you will look like a big mess
for a couple of days so
if you ask me if you're getting this
procedure done take about three to four
days off after and that is all the time
you will need to fully heal and for the
bruises to go away and be able to cover
them up with makeup I got them done on a
Monday and I could start filming
tutorials and cover them up with makeup
again on Thursday after you got your lip
injections love you so much back so as I
said you can definitely wear lipstick
after the procedure right after but you
have to cool your lips and to be able to
cool your lips you probably should them
wear any lipstick on top so the most
important times to cool your lips are
the day of the procedure and the day
after so I probably say that you could
start wearing lipstick or lip products
after about two days again but on the
day of the procedure and the day after
you have to cool your lips so much you
don't even want to think about putting
anything on them hi Nikki what is the
one thing you didn't like about having
injections one thing I didn't like about
having lip injections is the constant
fact that people have an opinion about
you you get your lips done so you are
insecure about your lips you get your
lips done so you don't love yourself
people immediately have this opinion
about you because you got your lips done
which is the biggest I could
ever think of because I got my lips done
because I wanted my lips to be bigger
I wanted the sides of my top lip to curl
up a little bit more and for my lipstick
to look symmetrical I got it done
because I love lipstick and I wanted the
lipstick to look good I love myself a
lot actually and the constant fact of
having to prove yourself almost of why
you got your lips done it just it gets
so bored oh that's a good one so the
first time I got them done they
definitely did affect my speech because
I just their there was so much lip to
handle with and my teeth just were like
dude no but what the hell are you doing
what is this so yeah definitely the
first time I got them done
I had to get used to my speech and the
way everything moves but after a while
it just happens and eating no problem
whatsoever the only thing I should
mention though after the procedure do
not do not drink out of the straw
because once you do this movement you
Kondo crinkle and krump your lips
together it hurts like
after the procedure that goes away after
about 4 to 5 days that pain wants you do
you crinkle it up make like a small ugly
asshole but other than that things will
start flowing naturally again after a
while oh you're watching me yeah girl
yeah girl where get girl work it girl
work it girl what's a selfie
where it's done so I think that answers
all of your probably most asked
questions and I hope that helped you out
a little if you have any further
questions please let me know in the
comment section down below and I will
try to get back to you yeah I want to
