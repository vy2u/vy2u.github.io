guys it's ed today I'm doing a tutorial
or more so like a playtime slash first
impressions 5 review video on the new
pure My Little Pony movie collection now
when it comes to packaging item Diaries
I think this collection is so much fun
with all the neutrals and like the dark
colors coming out recently I think it's
so awesome that pure was like you know
actually know we're going to come out
with bright ass colors and go there so
today I'm going to be taking this
palette for a spin I'm going to be
trying all the products from this
collection and coming up with this look
I spoiled it again
one day one day I'm going to tell myself
to not film an intro with the finished
look on because I'm spoiling I'm like
Game of Thrones
I wish ever never be ligated round yeah
today we are living up the color on this
channel
hence the wig my little pony I gotsta
got a cookie so if you want to know what
this collection looks like on my face
what it performs like keep watching like
always just a little bit alright so
before we start I do want to let you
know that I put some excessive amounts
of powder underneath my eye to catch any
fallout because we will be using bright
color so you really want that layer of
security so I'm prepped and ready to
play first color going to be going in
with is generosity as a transition color
in the crease and since I'm going for a
bolder more extreme colorful look I am
going to place this very high up to get
that drama in since of going for a halo
smoky eye I'm also placing it right on
the inner corners
with a clean Oprah 21 brush I'm not
going to blend and buff out the edges
and this is definitely one of my
favorite shapes out of the palette it's
just a beautiful neutral shade that you
can use every day to link to fine
but it still has a little bit of Juche
going on it's not like a boring Brown to
build up the halo effect I'm going to be
placing magic on the inner and outer
corners as well as in the crease and I'm
looking to light magic to give me a
little bit of trouble it is beautiful
once packed on but as soon as you start
blending it in it loses its power and
intensity you can kind of see happening
already as soon as I start slightly
blending it in it can get a little
patchy and even so with this shade it is
essential that in the end you go back in
and Pat a little bit more on like really
pack it on so you get that intensity
after all the blending so I kind of pack
on the color in the shape that I wanted
and then I always go back in with my
clean blending brush to like melt it all
together but as you can see this is
giving me a little bit of problem I wish
it was a little bit more crazy okay
clean blending brush and let's soften
this seat as soon as you start blending
it how it gets like a little patchy hole
so as you can see after blending we're
missing intensity like pigment in places
here don't worry about that for now
we're going to come back to that later
I'm gonna go in with the color of Pinkie
Pie and using this to warm up the crease
and give it some more color now this
color I love you only need the tiniest
tiniest amount to warm it up and get
that pigment and there's no fallout I
love that patient I'm going to work it
throughout the edge to get rid of that
greatness
going in with some maxilla cover-up
concealer if you cut the center of my
lid for some halo goodness I'm going to
be setting that using princess sky star
a beautiful mint that is one of my
favorite shades of the palette okay now
is that time where you go back in with
magic Andrey intensify it really pack it
on and don't touch it anymore because as
soon as you go back in with the blending
brush you're losing that intensity let's
spruce things up a little bit and then
go in with this Urban Decay heavy metal
glitter liner in distortion and this is
going right over top of the mint color
to gift some magic go and make sure you
really pack that glitter on by patting
it onto the lid okay I think it's time
to get rid of this mess on the under I'm
gonna dip into a little bit of face
powder and was away on the lower lash
line I will be applying Rainbow Dash I
am ready for some blue
applying some magic on the outer corners
and blending it down low to get some
smokiness going and then to sort of
ground the blue a little bit more I'm
going to go back in with the color
generosity and a Mac 239 brush and right
underneath I'm kind of tracing it and
blurring it out and somehow that's going
to make it look a little bit blurred and
grounded last but certainly not least
I'm going to go back in with princess
sky star and blinding that inner corner
baby to finish this look all I need is
some lashes and I'm going to be applying
my favorite any tooth berry lashes
all right so for cheeks when I'm first
going to do is start with a little bit
of bronzing and I'm going to stay away
so this is going to stay away from the
hoola light because it's been on my face
for months upon months upon months I'm
actually going to go into this morphe
palette right here this is called the 9c
palette and this is a gray staple for
contouring bronzing highlighting
although other highlight shades are too
dark for me so I'm picking up a little
bit of the bronzing powder and start
giving my face a little bit of warmth
and I absolutely would have used any
cheek products from this collection but
there are none except for it like the
highlighter sticks which I have a little
bit of an opinion about so I'm just
going to go ahead and move forward with
my own product also picking up the
tiniest amount of this shade right here
on this morphe m14 3 brush to do it a
little bit of additional contouring
for blush you're going to go in with
Oprah's might hi for a highlighter of my
favorite part I'm going to work with
some of my all-time favorites
these are artist Couture diamond glow
powder and I haven't picked these up in
a little bit I don't know why because
every time I wear these I lived for my
cheekbone first I want to go in with
this one right here called double take
this is an interesting looking one
because it's got a goldish duochrome to
like a warm pinkish beautiful base let
me demonstrate
so look right here see how it looks
really warm and beautiful but it has a
shift to it I love this one so going in
with that first base and on the cheeks
it transforms into this like duochrome
ish pink opal it's stunning
now you can definitely stop the glow
here call it a day and be done with it
but of course I'm going to go that extra
miles with the glow I'm going to go in
with Coco Lee and cocoa bling is my
favorite out of the entire collection it
is so intense and beautifully shiny it
does things to your body you can't quite
explain
makes it tangle and for this I'm
actually going to be using the brush
that comes with the collection this is
the completely concealer brush so right
in the center to kind of make the
highlight pop and going in with Coco
bling
also playing poker going to the tip of
my nose oh as well as a Cupid's bow
alright on to lips and I definitely
definitely want to be playing with these
glitter lip topper glosses you've heard
so much fun they smell like the best
candy on planet earth they are so so
pretty and I love that they have to do a
chrome glitter to it these are a party
on your mouth so I want to be doing like
a nude lip and then gloss it up with all
the fun color so if we're going to go in
with coloured raine classy lip paint the
eye - everybody say hi gosh oh she is
the tiniest cutest little Pomeranian
hello motion watch kiss and right on the
center I'm going to go in with a new
color brainless dick this is in the
color socialite this is more news I want
that pouty look
superclass I'm really looking forward to
this one right here because it's got
that like magenta pink do a chromatid
this one is the color Fluttershy
no way oh my God look at that oh my god
let's add a little bit of the pink to
water turned blue
all right I'm thinking some setting
spray to finish and we're done
and that guy's concludes this My Little
Ponies pure a collection inspired makeup
look I mean I had to go there with the
hair to really get it to that My Little
Pony level let me know what you think
it's probably too much for a lot of
people but I'm living so looking at this
collection and looking at the palette
first I think the palette is a lot of
fun is it the most creamy pigmented
eyeshadow pail that I've ever used in my
life no you know I think most of the
shimmery shades when you dampen your
brush it's really going to go there and
take it to the next level do I prove we
think that it is worth it getting this
palette yes I think you can create a lot
of fun fun looks with this you just got
to be careful with magic all the others
dampen your brush and oh my god you are
golden so I think this is a very very
fun palette if you love a little bit of
color if you love this like pressed
glittery pigment shadows if you're
looking for those looking a more you've
found them here my favorite part of this
collection are the glittery lip topper
glosses these are so much fun to play
with they have a nice glittery duochrome
they are sparkly and super super glossy
and comfortable on the lips they are
sticky but it's nowhere near immaculate
glass they definitely have a stickiness
to them but it's comfortable and nice to
wear and it feels really hydrating
and I think if you're in for like a Sun
color you definitely find it here if
you're getting anything from this
collection go for the glosses they are
by far the best
as for the all-in-one glow sticks these
are a no for me they take a lot of
friction and build up to show up and get
pigmentation and once it's there it just
looks off on the skin you'll find with
products like these that when you really
have to build it up and rub it on your
face it's going to disrupt your
foundation your concealer your powder
and it's going to leave you with holes
in your base and that is something that
I hate and I just feel like as soon as
the light hits it it's beautiful but as
soon as your cheek shifts away from the
light you see a really real looking
shadow and it's just not cute so if
there's one product in this launch that
I go you might notice that your money on
that it's all in one glow sticks which
is weird because I love a glow that's
weird for me to say that as for the
brushes I think brush is wise the
quality of them is okay it's not
something I feel myself gravitating
towards in the future a lot because
these are a little bit more on the
synthetic side now don't don't get me
wrong they are super super soft and
synthetic brushes can get really really
soft it's just that none of these
brushes really speak to what I want them
for I really like this one as a center
point for the highlight to really make
it blinding but honestly that's about
the only one I see myself using in the
future I think the packaging is
extremely cute but I moreso think this
is a fun gift for someone who's starting
out with makeup and needs a couple of
brushes or like as a gift to a friend to
surprise them with really really cute
packaging and just a fun idea so yeah I
think that wraps up this entire pure
collection my little ponies movie
