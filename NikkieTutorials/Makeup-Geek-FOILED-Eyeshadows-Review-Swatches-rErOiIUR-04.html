the new makeup geek foiled eyeshadows
ever since these came out my tweets have
been all about can you please do a
review on these shadows and people have
been asking for it in my comments and on
my facebook and just everywhere so today
I am here to talk about the makeup geek
flow shadow summer Lina from makeup geek
and her lab did some magic and they came
out with 10 new foiled eyeshadows and
these are a completely new formula
finish flesh eyeshadow and before I
start I already want to tell you guys
that this is something I have never
experienced before these are amazing
summer Lina did send these to me if you
don't know my relationship with Ray Lina
is that when I started YouTube Marlena
was sort of my YouTube mentor she taught
me everything she gave me tips and
tricks about lighting and content to
upload and Marlena is just like really
special person to me because she was
there in the beginning and she helped me
get started on YouTube after that I will
always be grateful and thank you Marlena
if you're watching this you did such an
amazing job on these I have no words
that she also sent me this case they
come in and this is sort of like a C
palette it has a magnet highest layer
right here which you can pop all your
eyeshadows on you can pop the regular
sort of makeup geek shadows on it we can
also pop neck shadows on it so that is
absolutely great this palette this
refill palette is awesome it has an
amazing beautiful gunmetal color it's
the same color as their brushes and
their blushes packaging which I love it
reminds me a lot of hourglass which is a
good thing so it comes in this sort of
makeup geek Z palette the MG palette I
will call it and in there you can put
your eyeshadows and I put my makeup geek
foiled eyeshadows in here and here they
are in there oh look at that oh double
hand reflection so here they are all ten
of them and they're soft majesticness
let's start with the first one the first
one I want to talk about is Houdini and
Houdini is sort of like a deep teal
greenish bluish color it
stunning it's great for a smoky eyes
four on the lid or even in the crease I
will add swatches and we're going to
edit to my arms the thing about these
shadows is that they feel like a cream
they set like a powder and they shine
like a chrome dream I can definitely
tell you guys that the first time I
tried these and I stick my finger in
there I was like are these a cream
because they felt so creamy and buttery
and they actually felt like a cream but
then once you put them on the eyes and
you let them set they transform to a
powder so they're going to have that
amazing pigmentation that you won't even
have to do anything for and then once it
sets it sets and it won't go anywhere
this is Houdini oh my god this is not
working how it should oh that's okay so
this right here is Houdini and this is
what it looks like swatched
it's like that holy moly
on the skin it definitely transforms
into a little bit more of a blue instead
of a teal next one is jester and I would
describe jester as a olive hunter mix of
a green it's a really pretty color
I'm not a green lover so this will never
actually be my favorite because I'm not
a green person but if you love green
eyeshadow this is just the thing okay
that is that is gorgeous this is what
jester looks like and on the skin it
transforms into a little lighter golden
green color so it's a green base with
lots of gold and shine and Sheen and
it's just majestical and awesome next
color is center stage this is a bright
royal shimmering chrome blue
I like blue way better than green so
this is higher up in my list and what I
like about this is that it actually has
a purple chrome reflex in one light and
it's like bright chrome royal blue in
one in the other light it's like if I
look at it like this it's a purple
reflex for me but once I face it to the
camera it turns a blue reflex
we're just awesome so you could go for
this really nice duo chrome deep intense
blue smokey eyes and mix it with some
purple to get the pearl
blugh going so many ideas next color is
Caitlin rose and Caitlin Rose is a
special color because all profits go to
Benton disease if you're getting one of
these colors get Caitlin rose because
you're actually doing something good by
buying makeup so Caitlin rose is a I
would say just a warm toned shiny purple
it's awesome it's a little less
pigmented than all the others if I have
to be 100% honest with you but
nonetheless it's still absolutely
gorgeous it's definitely way lighter and
more purple than center stage but
Caitlin Rose is just a beautiful soft
yet bright purple chrome and it has a
really nice bright red pink magenta sort
of reflex to it it is less pigmented
than the others but still nonetheless
it's a great color plus if you buy it it
helps people with abettin disease out
next up is magic act and this is a gold
a gold and I love me my gold
so this rocks this is literally one of
the most gorgeous yellow golds you will
ever run into because it has that
beautiful it has a beautiful chrome
finish it has a beautiful shine is
really light reflective which makes it
perfect for on the inner corners if
you're doing these halo smoky eyes by
putting darker colors on the sides and
this one on the middle holy
next up is show time and I've described
this as mix sketch on crack on chrome
crack this color screams my name because
I love my warm toned darker smoky colors
I mean this color screams my lower
lashline and crease name because I live
on this color I put that color in my
crease lower lashline s smoke everything
out with that color I love it
the only thing I have to tell you about
this one is that it's way less chromey
and shiny than all the others next color
is mesmerized and this is a taupe I
described this as Max's set in taupe on
chrome crack and the formula on these
are absolutely insane they feel so
buttery so almost wet this one also
mesmerised is a beautiful color for on
the
it for like a smokey eye daytime smokey
eye and it's also a little bit less
chromey than all the others
so Showtime and mesmerised are great for
like in the crease also because they
don't have the high chroma feel next
color is one of my favorites it's
grandstand this color also has my name
written all over it
grandstand is a beautiful warm chrome
brown copper and heavy looks at my
channel if you look at my channel you
can see coppers Browns smoky coppery
Cromie Browns everywhere and so this
color is one of my all-time favorites
that Marlena has launched this one is so
great I've wanted so many times already
and I love it another one that has
tutorials and nici written all over it
is a flame thrower copper orange intense
chrome this the best is also one of my
favorites because again it has that
warmth it has that copper eNOS it has
said warmth and I love that I'm all
about that and is so pigmented
I am dying over here last but not least
and this is also the color I am wearing
on my eyelids today this is in the
spotlight also one of my favorites and
you probably know why because it has
warmth it has this high shine Cromie
touch finish who has a chrome touch
nobody oh oh my god I can't deal with my
life right oh it's light it's natural
it's wearable but it still has that
intense light reflective chrome touch
again not a touch finish which makes it
perfect for daily wear but it's still
glamour enough for like a night out so I
wore it with winged eyeliner false
lashes and a bold lip and great so these
are all ten eyes shadow all ten new
folds eyeshadows by makeup geek and let
me tell you on which ones to get and
which ones you can skip on I would have
recommend skipping on any because these
are so awesome let's go so my three
favorites by far are in the spotlight
because it's natural you can pair
up for everyday use but it's still very
glamorous and awesome then also
flamethrower because I love my copper
and I love that warmth and I'm all about
the copper so I love this one and then
the third one that I really recommend is
Grand Stand because it's a little bit
more wearable than flamethrower you can
see right here it's more wearable and
it's just one of those colors that
everyone will love I mean who doesn't
love a warmish chrome Brown copper it's
it's a dream that everyone wants to
dream about the next one I really
recommend is Caitlin Rose because all
funds of this eyeshadow all all the
money this eyeshadow makes go to Benton
disease charities which is amazing and
just for that alone I would buy it just
to you know have do something do a good
deed with my makeup I do have to tell
you though that it is by far the less
pigmented of all of them but it's still
a beautiful color and if you put a
really good white like NYX milk jumbo
pencil underneath it will just pop like
no other so it works and then the three
I'm not really in love with is because
those are not really colors I gravitate
towards a lot our center stage Houdini
and jester and again those are just the
colors I'm not really in love with
because I don't really obsess over green
and blue that's just me I'm not really a
green or blue lover I've never been
probably never will so that's why I'm
not the biggest favorite of them but I
mean if you love green if you love teal
if you love blue I mean what am I
talking about just Normie because you
will be all over these because they are
super pretty so here we are one more
time all the 10 foil eyeshadows by
makeup geek these retail for $9.99 each
I know that is a higher price than their
regular eyeshadows so these were of a
higher cost to actually make and produce
so they sell for a higher price but
still $9.99 is I mean what are we
talking about here so that's it guys I
will put a link down below on where you
can get these and then you can buy them
