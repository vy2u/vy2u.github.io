inspired by Audrey O'Day this look she
wore in her Batgirl video with identity
came that days where she was still with
them
I don't care she's so low now because I
love her I love her style I love her
hair I love her nude lips booming smoky
eyes with false lashes beautiful skin so
this is my look inspired by Aubrey I
love love love her yes you can wear this
out to the club or to a nice evening out
and are if you work in the club wear
this do your work in the club pretty
content winners they are coming up this
weekend I'm so sorry but I've been sick
the last week so you might hear it on my
voice I have a cold and I was really
sick the last last week so that is why
I've been missing in action but the
contest winners will be up this weekend
and if you want to know how I did this
Aubrey O'Day is fine look then please
keep on watching
to start this look off you need to
like a cereal is to prepare your eyes
for increasing and I use my name is Han
I to the base and for a pop off to make
the colors pop up my lid I'm going to
use my crumble pencil in milk and this
is going on with a lid and then I'm
taking a brush and blending it out so
the first color we're going to apply is
max setting taupe and I'm taking it to
39 by Mac and this is just going on to
your lid nothing hard just onto your lid
now I'm going to take d'être Florrie
wormwood it's number 34 and I'm taking a
essence of beauty crease brush the
bigger sized one first I'm going to
blend that in and then I'm going to make
an outer V so go up and then go into
your crease and you really want to make
it an outer fee because in the video
it's like really on like shaped to not
blend it it's blended but with a like
just get that out or you just hold it
we're going to blend this edges just a
little bit with a 252 at least that is
what I'm taking you can use any brush
you like but just those edges and then
we're going to deepen that out of you
even more with a black to go to black
you have I'm taking one from B spot
cosmetic and now I'm going to work that
into my outer V
then blend that out with any brush you
prefer I'm just taking this and then
take some of that warm lit again warm
wood and this is going in your crease as
well just a little bit nothing too harsh
and keep that our Rafi you're going to
take max vanilla and this is going to be
our highlight but it's not the only
highlight we're going to use because
we're gonna use two and you know my
favorite technique is to blend all those
other colors down so I'm just blending
those edges of the of the form of my
eyeshadow design with that highlight
just blend notes edges one by one and
now I'm taking just a little bit a
little a little bit of white frost and
that is going on my brow bone as well
for some shimmer and now you want to
reapply all the color so I'm going to
reapply this setting so if I'm a lid on
the warm wood between the black and in
my crease and then in my outer V the
black again and then I will be back to
tell you what to do with the lower lid
so for my lower lid I'm gonna take
wormwood wormwood by d'être for we
again and this is going on my lower lid
two-thirds of the way in you know I love
this color but I hade Baggies I never
get product out of it oh you know
baggies I love them but I love to call
our above values
now take black any black eyeshadow and
put this on the outer corner and connect
it with the design above with that now
let's take my X jumbo pencil milk again
put that on your inner corner likes to
blend it out of it and then take your
like Sigma 219 and take a lot lot of
vanilla and that is going on your inner
corner and here as well your tear ducts
