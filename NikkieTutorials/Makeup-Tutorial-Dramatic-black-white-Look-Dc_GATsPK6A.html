dramatic white silver and black look it
was a request from someone on the makeup
geek forum and I hope you like it
and if you want to know how I did is
from dramatic dramatic dramatic medic
look keep on watching
to start this dramatic white-and-black
look you're going to put on your primer
I use Beijing che stick and just like in
the Arabic tutorial we're going to put
gesso on the lid to help it blend out
the pencil and all the colors now you're
going to take a black creamy eyeliner
pencil I will take gosh eyeliner in
black ink make sure it's sharp
so sharpen it up a bit and just like in
our previous video you're going to look
straight in your mirror and paint that
crease line on your eye again I can't
talk
start applying that okay now take a
small brush and blend the line out just
wiggle it back and forth
what's a q-tip flim the unload a bit now
you're going to take that essence of
beauty crease brush again the bigger
size one and take your 88 palette and go
in the color above black go in that
color it's a slightly black gray color
and start tracing that line and making
it dark so just trace that line a bit
make it darker and if you mess up a bit
take a q-tip and just remove the shadow
from the lip space
take that smaller size one and go in the
black color from the pellet and start on
that line again trace that line this
doesn't matter the little thingies and
then take some more and start blending
it upwards start blending the line up
with the black shadow just blend up then
take the bigger size one and go in that
black color really lightly because you
don't want too much black and blue and
the black above the line so you get a
nice black stroke on your crease blend
it upwards then take your asana Kashuk
blending brush and blend it out of it
okay
now we're going to let that crease rest
for a bit and we're going to do our lid
I'm going to take a small stiff shader
brush like this one and go in gesso and
pack this all really good and much in
all you want to call it on the inner
third of the lid staying under the line
of course if you really want to make it
a vibrant met wide so keep adding deso
until it is
intensity that you like next step is
taking your platinum pigment by Mac
another great paper by Mac it's really
shiny and smooth and get them on the
same brush and start padding this onto
the remaining space up there up the lip
and of course you want to stay under
that special line when you come to the
middle blend it with the gesso so apply
it then just take it a little bit in to
overlap that just so just a little bit
not so much but just a little bit and
that's it for deep line and pigment then
apply some more gesso and color will up
with the Platinum pigment
now take that small essence of beauty
crease brush again and go back in the
black color and again just trace a line
and making it dark again
especially run there then blend it out a
bit and then take that bigger sized one
and go in that black color and start
sweeping it upwards again now start full
ending it up really well we wrote here
now take your Sonia Kashuk blending
brush and blend it out then wipe that
Sai akashic blending brush off really
well and go in chess oh and apply to
suited brow bone then go back in that
gray car from the pallet just a little
bit with that scientistic blending brush
and blend this above the black and under
B gesso this is going to act as a little
bit as a blending color take some more
gesso and reapply that blending it down
with that gray color then take that sso
beauty crease brush bigger size one
again and go back in the black make that
on darker again then take just a little
bit more platinum payment on that stiff
shader brush and apply that around there
then take just a little bit more of
gesso and apply it there that was a
pretty upper lid are we going to do our
lower lid take that pencil eye pencil my
gosh the black one and sweep it on the
lower lid then let that small brush up
from the essence of beauty crease do and
go and platinum pigment go in that and
apply this to the inner corner the lower
lid then we've done that blend it with
that black
now take that / a blending brush and
blend everything out they are going to
line your upper lid with black track
fluid line and put on some mascara and
then I will be back to tell you how to
finish off this look okay so that's it I
hope you liked it umm I get some gosh
lipstick on my lips and on top of that
some fanciful flash glass by Mac I hope
you'll like it it's really dramatic but
yeah I hope you like it
