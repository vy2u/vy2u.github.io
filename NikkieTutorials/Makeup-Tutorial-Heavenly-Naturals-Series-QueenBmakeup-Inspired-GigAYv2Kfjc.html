series a new one and this one is a lot
of series with heavily natural pigments
or products basically I got some new
stuff from them and I am in love Plus
this is a video dedicated it to queen
bee makeup she hasn't got a youtube or
anything but she has got a blogspot and
MySpace and up side and I'm putting all
that in the sidebar so you can check her
out and I have something to tell you
some of you were asking me how do you
always come up with your looks well it's
because of queen bee makeup I always go
to her side and get inspiration so this
video is dedicated to her because this
book is completely stolen from her using
handling natural pigments so I hope
you'll like it if you have any questions
at the end of this video leave them in
the comment section below go check out
queen bee makeup
follow me on twitter and i hope you like
it
bye
so before I begin I'm so sorry my
brothers are in the other room again so
you might hear them do weird things so
after you apply all your bases and I
applied some and YX I'm a pencil in milk
to make the pigment stick to it and the
first color I'm going to use is Samri
all or some real buy heavily naturals
and it's this beautiful beautiful deep
burgundy pink color and I'm just taking
a 239 by Mac and I'm taking this and I'm
telling you these are one of the best
matte things I've ever used like they
are like a butter they have like no work
to blend them out they're like buttery
day they just blend out so easily and
they look like silk on your lid I am in
love with heavily natural matte payment
I love them once you have applied that
beautiful matte color I'm going to take
the Coastal Scents 88 shimmer palette
and I'm taking that color that one right
there so I'm holding it up for a few
seconds to let you count the rows and
the stuff and I'm taking a stigma 224
and I'm taking that and that is going to
blend out in my crease it's like the
same sangryeol color only a little bit
more vivid and shimmery of course
because so weird oh it was a beautiful
matte I'm just blending that out I'm so
much brow bone
and now it's time for our highlight I'm
going to use have only natural vanilla
crush and then taking my favorite
highlight brush these take my 275
everyone should get this and that it's
just going on my brow bone it's like a
creamy white color and then I like to
take this bigger wash and you know I do
this all the time and make that shape of
your eyeshadow and then of course when
all the other colors down to make that
nice gradient effect now I'm going to
reapply this sangryeol and the pink
color of my 88 palette and then I'm
going to show you how we go on with this
look now I like to take this brush and
the other 88 palettes and none shimmer
one and I'm going to make a mix of this
color right here that deep deep purple
and this color right here and I'm mixing
those together and that is going on the
outer corner and a little bit onto my
upper lash line and then into the crease
to make it a little bit more smoky
now I'm going to take max vanilla and
I'm going to put that on my inner
corners I know
queen bee makeup doesn't have this but I
always do this to open up my eyes and
make them look like really beautiful so
I always do this whenever I do a look
now for the lower lid I'm gonna take
have only naturals fancy schmancy I love
that name and this is going on my lower
lid and extended upwards to around here
so it's going like this or um like this
and I'm using a small brush for that and
then I'm going to darken it up around my
lash line the outer corner so with this
color for my finger is that and then I
will be back to tell you what is on my
list and all that stuff because I'm not
going to show my lower lash lower lids
anymore because it gets to becomings and
in the last video you saw the examples
of it so I'm going to do with a fancy
schmancy the darker color on the outer
corners and then some vanilla on the
inner corners and then I will be back
so I'm going to put on some liner on my
waterline and upper lid and mascara
blush architect by L'Oreal and then I'll
be back
so on my lips I kept it new because
community makeup headed nude as well and
that's why I love it even more because I
love news so this completes my heavily
natural series number one queen bee
makeup inspired tutorial video I don't
know what I'm talking about but I it is
it is dramatic it is dramatic but you
can wear this to like a party or if you
have that attitude like most of us do
you just go out with it and shine and
don't care what people think about it
because it's what you want to wear so I
hope you liked it if you have any
questions I'll leave them in the comment
section below and go check out queen bee
makeups blog spot and her supplied I
will put them in the sidebar and I hope
you enjoyed this video so thanks for
