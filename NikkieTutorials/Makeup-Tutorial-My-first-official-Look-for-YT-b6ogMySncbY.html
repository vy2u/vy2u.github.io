we're going to add that right in the
middle outwards nano outwards
middle

get a cheap cheap cheap cheap drugstore
it's really cheap and now we're going to
take our gosh paradox and in the inner
corner of the eye let's get a nice light
effect other eye
okay now we're going to take berry and
foil it to dust and 22 it's black get
your pick
Mac 1 6 4 s brush again and depth at and
find go to dust 22 where we put the
emerald we're going to put that finally
this 22 black gold on top of it
that the reason why I'm using gosh
products a lot is that here in the now
lines we don't have berry and we don't
have Mac and the only loose powders and
eyeshadows our gosh so
that's why refresh teaching circular
motions okay now get your barely and
dazzled us in number 24 it's old gold
and get an angled brush and do that
under here
and get your Frank little dose of Bernie
and do it on the outer corners make it a
bit blacker
I'm going to highlight my brows just a
white color get that Rick laughing
shader brush
I don't know particle up Mac once
Explorer s circular motions and rainbow
motions like that just take a sense it's
a really cheap brand from the drugstore
in Ellen's African Queen and it's a
rejectable eyeliner like that is kind of
angled
