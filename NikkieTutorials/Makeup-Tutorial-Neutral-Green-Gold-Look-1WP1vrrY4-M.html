look I really love it and yeah I don't
want to do it so long intro so I think
that's it
right okay I hope you like it bye
okay to start off you're going to apply
a base to pretend your eye from creasing
okay so i already did that i used family
Paint Pot my Mac and now we're going to
apply our crease first and we're going
to use old gold pigment by Mac and put
your brush like this and then go in
right like this go and with and then
when you come here go like this
so start like this and when you come
into the tear duct put your brush like
that okay you've applied that you grab
some nylon by Mac sorry this color I
love that color one of my favorites
and with that 239 go into that nylon and
pack it on the lid with patting motions
Peppa Peppa Peppa bad because when you
pat your eyeshadow on the pigmentation
stays the strongest if you know what I
mean so if you swipe it the pigmentation
goes like it fades out but if you pet it
you get the most between a
of the shadow so pepper on the lip
until you have something like this then
grab some old gold pigment again with
that 239 and reapply it like that just
so it's nice and light right again and
then grab your to 17 and the spiced
chocolate quad and grab some spiced
chocolate the brown color and apply this
to the outer crease and your outer piece
so like this swirl at that eye socket go
in and then go a little bit in your
crease don't go all the way in because
we want that outer part to be dark so
swipe it inwards go a little bit in your
crease
you
like that then we're going to grope just
a little rap just a little bit more
uncle Pigman with my Sonia Kashuk large
blending brush that just go a little bit
on flick away any axis and just go above
that brown to blend it out grab some
more nylon with your 239 reapplying it
to the lid just like that then with that
so you catch your brush go back in the
brown from the spa chocolate what and we
apply that then wrap your Coastal Scents
88 palette and we're going to highlight
with that one and grab the third one
down the almost fits the one with the
yellow tint to it and apply that to the
brow bone wrap just a little bit more
Olga pigment to make it live run again
and then again just a little bit of the
brown to darken it up a bit more that's
it for the upper lid the lower lid is
going to be really simple just take a
little bit of that slush chocolate color
and apply it to the lower lid and go
like halfway in that's it
I'm now going to line my upper lid using
my favorite gosh black ink eyeliner and
then
to put on some mascara using Rimmel
London's Glen ice mascara and then I
will be back to tell you what to do with
the lips okay so be right back
okay so what we're now going to do is
our lips as usual I'm going to use my
gosh lipstick in darling so when you've
got that on you take some sugar int
devil glass by Mac and get that on your
lips and that's it okay guys I hope
you'll like this umm everyday Christmas

especially with that green in it but I
hope you like this look again if you
don't have gosh lipstick and darling
