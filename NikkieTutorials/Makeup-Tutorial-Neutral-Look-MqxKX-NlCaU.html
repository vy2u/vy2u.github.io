look it's a nice neutral neutral natural
look
using Coastal Scents ultra shimmer
palette on this look was done earlier by
ex Parkash on her sister Chelsea love
you guys and I really wanted to do this
look too so I hope you like it I hope my
viewers and subscribers I like it too
and if you want to know how I did this
look people want to start off we're
going to prime our lids I'm using
painterly Paint Pot by Mac goes to them
get it on a brush or use it with your
fingers and prime goes blue then take a
smaller brush this also come back
okay so now you're going to take a step
shada brush like next to 39 and grab the
Coastal Scents ultra shimmer palette I
need to be really careful because I let
it fall on the ground so now some
shadows are those wait I'm going to do
this are you seeing that you're seeing
that right I'm going to use that color
that one KC then get that color on the
brush and pack it on Doughboy
Pacolet take our 217 brush by Mac you
know how it looks like and go in here we
go again this color that one
that on so get the brush and go in that
eye socket put it in there swirl it
around and go your crease
pick up some more going it eyes talking
swirl it around go a little bit in and
dark it out the crease
a little bit more
right okay what the brush up a little
bit and go in a darker color I'm using
you see it that color the one right
above the black net just on the outer
corner just go a little teeny bit into
the crease so I sock it swirled around
and just like there just a little tiny
bit
then you take some of the black color
and put that on the outer outer other
outer corner of your feet pulling it in
and go up as you can see I'm not holding
my brush in here but I go like here so
it will ends better so that's a tip you
can apply when do your face if you want
really share application of the color
just take your brush but not right here
but take it a little bit far far away
from the bristles so that way it blends
really nicely
back in that first brown color reviews
for the crease and blend it out a bit
more
just like that
see then go back with your soup 2:39 in
that light color we use in the first
step and reapply them to the lid and
there I don't want to use a highlighter
for this neutral look because I just
don't want to use that so grab a round
pencil brush like that it's a little bit
bigger another tutor 219 go in that
first brown color we fused in the crease
again and put this on the outer corners
of your lower lid
to darken that out just a bit more and
do in that second darker color we've
used an increase and apply that to then
going that light color the first step
color and put that on the remaining part
of the lower lid
let's there like that so that's it for
the shadows part of this video grab some
q-tips like to and remove all the fall
out and make a great shape now I'm going
to use my wet and well liquid eyeliner I
go to line my upper lips then I'm going
to put on some mascara I'm using Rimmel
glam ice with Kara I love that mascara
go boy and then I will tell you how to
finish off this look so they watching
please okay so to finish off this look
use a gosh
lipstick in number 134 darling it's a
nice creamy nude color
put that on the lips
it has kind of a pink tint to it but I
love it
like bad
and you can leave it like this but I
like to put some gloss on top of that
and I'm using Rimmel or vinyl stars in
number 101 94 94 love-struck so I'm
using rimmel's vinyl stars lip gloss and
a love-struck I'm putting that on top of
that lipstick and that completes our
look I hope you liked this neutral look
