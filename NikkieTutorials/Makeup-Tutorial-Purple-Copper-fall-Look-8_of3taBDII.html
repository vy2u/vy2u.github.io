look number one and um it's mainly using
purples and coppers and gold glitter and
yeah I'm pretty much a leopard right now
because I've leopard earrings a leopard
sing leopard nails I have it all so this
is a leopard fall look now
um I hope you like it if you want to
know how I did this please keep on
watching and please this is a big nut on
the big shot this is a shout out to crap
vintage are tacky this girl does amazing
makeup oh my god
she is like nyan nyan nyan you to fool
me on
I love her um every time I see she
posted a new video on the car the new
video car has new video and I have to
watch it in you have to watch it as well
so the link to Korra vintage or tacky is
in the sidebar and it will make me
really happy if you check her out so go
check her out and if you wanna know how
I did this then please keep on watching
to start off this look you need to apply
a base to your list to protect your eyes
from getting that line throughout the
day throughout the day and I use my miss
Helen I to the base and now to make the
color pop on the lid I'm gonna use my
axe milk jumbo pencil and this is going
on my lid and on the inner corners and
I'm just gonna take a brush and blend
that out now I'm gonna take max effects
eyeshadow I love this color it's like
this weird gray green color but it has a
opal shimmer so I'm getting a Sigma 239
brush and going in that car and that is
going on the inner corners and just a
little bit onto the lid so right there
that is where you want to have two
effects as well and then just blend it
up so this is your inner corner
highlight now we're going to take this
beautiful pigment and I love it and it's
my favorite pigment of oh and it is max
push the edge and it's from the makeup
artist collection collection and I'm
taking a 239 by Mac and I'm just taking
some of that pigment and I'm going in
the lid to get it in that brush and then
you're going to put this on to do it oh
wait anymore I'm blending with that fax
right there and then just put it on the
lid and just a little bit into the
crease like so then do this
and then just blended in Allah
now I'm taking sketch one of my favorite
colors by Mac and the Sonia Kashuk
blending brush and I'm going in the
color and this is going into the crease
and do not go any further than that
purple because then you will overlap the
VEX that you don't want that so just
stay right there don't go any further
blend it out of it and keep that shape
working for you
now for the copper orange color
I'm gonna take my spiced chocolate quad
from the cult of teri like one or two
years ago ago remember one right one I'm
taking these thick more trouble kit to
24 and just put it in teeny tiny bit
like two times because it is pigmented
as how because it's Alex pearl
and this is gonna show up immediately
you see that that is just with like two
or three pushes pushes this just pushes
so I'm just blending that into my crease
blend it in baby
now reapply some of that sketch and make
it darker in the outer V and in the
crease you'll add some black there later
on but for now just a sketch now take
some vanilla the knack that car I love
it and take the 250g mm we're going to
do our highlight and this is going on
your brow bone and blend the edges of
that coppery orange color down so I'm
going here and I'm blending it down I'm
going here and making the shape and I'm
going here and blending down that orange
to get a nice gradient effect right now
you're going to reapply all the colors
but for the crease I'm fruth going to
apply some black so take any black you
have any one any any any kind and just
do your outer V with it going your outer
feel like that it's a little bit more
contrast and then just take your 224 by
Sigma blend that out and now you're just
going to reapply all the other colors so
you're going to reapply the orange the
purple the back
the highlight one do we have more that's
it so that's what you're going to
reapply all again and then I will be
back to tell you what to do for lower
lids pretty lower lid I'm gonna take
violet rants and I'm going to take these
Sigma 219 and I'm taking quite a lot of
it and this is going on your lower lid
like two-thirds of the way in and I'm
taking some black and just on the lash
line now I'm taking the NYX jumbo pencil
again on the inner corners I'm just
blending it out and now I'm taking I'm
lending that 219 brush off really well
I'm taking the fax that's going on your
inner corners but I feel like that's a
little bit too dark so I'm taking
vanilla and I'm going right on top of
that right on top
like that so that's it for the shadows
um pretty nice you don't have to do this
you can live like this and be all sexy
at some liner and mascara I wanted to
knock it up a bit so I took the Mack
gold glitter call this and I'm taking a
little brush and I dropped the fising if
you like and I'm making the brush a
little bit wet and then I'm placing that
gold glitter on the middle of my lid and
while it's still got that glitter I take
some dry glitter is it another brush
place it on top for more sparkle and
that's what I get for the glitter so I'm
gonna do that right now you don't have
to do this I'm not gonna show you it and
then I will tell you what is on my lips
and then I'm moving back so be right
back okay so on my lips I apply
concealer you're taking notes take if
you're taking notes concealer gosh 134

gloss my gosh in number four and in case
