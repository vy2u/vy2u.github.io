two seconds ago guys so today I'm
presenting to you my March hit synagogue
nose and for this month we're going to
change things up a little tiny bit I'm
going to start off with one oh god no
continue later on in the video but I
have to get this off my chest oh yeah No
so my boyfriend and I we've been
together for about two and a half years
now we're doing absolutely perfectly
great and we've been saving up to you
buy an apartment and you might ask why
would you buy an apartment not rented in
Holland right now it is for us it's
cheaper to buy than rent right now is
just mortgage and everything everything
is looking up to be better to buy an
apartment so we've been saving up all
our money for like the past year and we
pretty much we did really good we did
very good together and then a couple of
days ago on Easter we decided to have
just a quick snack at the golden arches
of all places Mickey D's and we enjoy
our cheeseburger with a milkshake
and we're like okay that was nice let's
go home and we drive away from the
parking place normal as ever and this
douchebag he decides to leave his
parking spot puts his car in reverse and
smashes in to my car I'm like I can
understand people having you know little
like car crashes or you know something
happening to you when you're driving a
car but rule number one when you're
leaving your parking spots you look
behind you when you put your car in
Reverse you look around you oh my god
is a car approaching me I will wait
putting my car in reverse and
smashing into it okay collect your
thoughts you're fine you got this so I
was like okay the sound of the crash
wasn't that loud so my car should
have some damage but not that much my
boyfriend and I get out of the car and
my entire door is smashed in plus right
next to the door and that is the hardest
place to fix because that involves your
entire car
so basically yesterday I went to my car
dealer person I went to my person who I
bought my car from and I was like I'm
insurance with them but so of course
we're not the guilty ones so everything
will be paid for us with insurance wise
and everything but my car is
wrecked so what it comes down to now is
that all the money I saved for an
apartment has now gone into a new car I
literally I had to buy a new car so I
can tell you right now that March was
pretty damn amazing but it it just
 up at the end I'm so sorry for
all my French I'm just so pissed off
anyways welcome to my March hits in 'god
knows hello
so the first hits of the month march are
the Krylon TV paint sticks you've seen
these all over my drag race inspired
tutorials and I'm really enjoying these
I've gotten a lot of comments to talk a
little bit more about these yes they are
heavy yes they are about the most full
coverage foundation you could ever
imagine could ever get so I still feel
like it's not any heavier than a regular
full coverage foundation so let's say if
you are a fan of Mac Studio Fix fluid
that's about as heavy as these feel just
as heavy on the skin as Mac Studio Fix
fluid does if you're used to wearing
full coverage foundations and these do
not feel any heavier at all now if
you're a light kind of foundation person
and you try these for the first time you
will call them heavy that's how the
cookie crumbles how you Sara
I don't know my next favourites are the
coloured raine liquid lipsticks I am
going to say it I like these better than
the Kat Von D everlasting liquid
lipsticks and they are a very close
they're just as good
maybe just an even tiny little bit
better than Anasazi Beverly Hills liquid
lipsticks I said it I did it the color
drain liquid lipsticks are the most
matte liquid lipsticks I've ever used
they are the most pigmented I love them
I love the company I love the colors the
colors are so unique and no like any
other brand and I just really really
enjoy using these I've been posting them
all over my Instagram lately and today I
am wearing a mixture of marshmallow
which is like the lime crime cashmere
but since somebody wants to use flanker
anymore we go for color rain I mix it
with just a tiny teeny bit of soul and
these two together are live and
definitely check them out if you want to
hop onto that liquid lipstick boat so I
really like these
the next product I really like is the
Smashbox primer water I've read in my
comments that when I used it in my video
that people said it's the exact same
formula as max charge water is just the
exact same product in a different kind
of packaging and another brand I'm okay
with that I want to run out of this I
will get max charge water and if they're
out at Mac I know I can get a substitute
at Smashbox I'm totally fine with that
what I really like about the primer
water is that once you sprayed onto your
face it just gives your face that really
tacky feeling almost as if it's ready
for all the foundation that you put over
top to cling onto it and really grab
onto the skin and lock itself in it just
makes you feel like yes I'm ready for
that foundation now so it's a great step
for any primer routine in your life next
up if you're really enjoying the Dior
glow Maximizer I've got this because a
couple of you in my comments suggested
this but it right after and I fell in
love is just as amazing as my back of
showing skin perfectors it's it's it's
amazing I'm wearing it underneath my
foundation today it's just it's a great
product again to prime your face too
give it that luscious Norrish feeling
plus it gives you that ultimate glow and
I just feel like together with the
primer water they are the excellent base
for foundation to just glide into the
skin just look beautiful perfect polish
it's just amazing next product is
bicolor pop and this is EXO super shock
shadow this was part of Shan EXO's
collaboration with them and this is EXO
and I am swooning over this color
because it's such a beautiful neutral
champagne gold every wearing this a lot
on my nan drag days I've been doing a
lot of drag race tutorials this month
and sometimes it kind of translates onto
my normal makeup this but on a more
neutral days I've been wearing EXO super
shock shadow on the lid and it's just so
neutral but glam it's like wearable but
glam it's like Kim Kardashian but not
trying too hard
it's like looking on points but not
trying too hard a brush I've been dying
over is my Sigma it's the small Shepherd
blend a little it's the small tapered
blending a 45 brush I I used to think
okay when I use a big blending brush it
just blends everything up perfectly but
I felt like when I needed more
definition and more precise color
placement I I was lacking in a brush for
that purpose so I got the Sigma small
tapered be 45 brush and this is perfect
do you blend out a cut crease I've been
using this in all my drag race tutorials
caster acts are cut creases and and so
this is great for blending out a really
concentrated crease it's it's just great
for blending smaller eyes so I have
smaller eyes and I like to work with
like creases to make them look a little
bit bigger and to blend those cut
creases or really concentrated creases
out this brush has been my Savior
Anasazi briefly Hills came out with lip
glosses after she made the beauty
community gasps for air with her liquid
lipsticks she came out with lip glosses
which is like on the total opposite side
of liquid lipsticks because their glossy
and my two favorite lip glosses that
chief made are from the nude set dainty
and undressed
this is undressed and this is dainty and
dainty is more on the pink sweet side of
lip gloss and this is more of a neutral
nude a little bit of a darker nude color
and I love them alone separate but
together these are like the perfect nude
lip gloss
I love dainty and undressed and I'm
going to give it a name for if you
combine the two together the lip gloss
will be called dress me dainty that's
going dress we dressed me dainty if
you're looking for a super pigmented lip
gloss that smells amazing which is not
sticky but tacky but still is amazing
smells like a dream and just if you're
looking for a lip gloss that you will
fall in love with honest as rebellious
so those were all my hits for the month
of March I know it weren't a lot of
products but I'm only going to show you
what I've actually really been loving so
this is where you're gonna get the end
girl no so on to my last oh god no for
the month of March it is by Giorgio
Armani and it's the fluid chair in
number two now you saw me using this in
a tutorial this month or last month
don't remember as I was so stoked to try
this on because this thing cost a
fortune
this was fifty four euros fifty four
euros that's about I don't know sixty
dollars so I bought it in Amsterdam I
was like okay this is gonna rock my
socks off because it just looks like
glow in a pot it just looks like it's
gonna make you look like Aphrodite of
all people so I put this on for the
first time in that video and it was such
a disappointment and you could barely
see any shine whatsoever it dried my
skin out
it didn't give it any nourishment or
hydration or whatever it just made it
dry and then once I put my Georgia
Armani luminous silk foundation over top
it just all looked like one big mess and
I was so so so it is the point it and it
sucks because if you swatch this it just
looks so luminous and beautiful and
amazing but then once you put it on your
actual face it does nothing so that guys
