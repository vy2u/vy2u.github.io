Cinna God knows March was the month
where I turned 20 to 22 so it was my
birthday March a second and Mark has
been very very eventful yeah I don't
really have a lot more to tell you about
this month other than I love you I want
to take this moment to thank you for all
your support and love and constant
positivity
it's insane I'm so thankful so grateful
and you guys make everything so much
better and I love you so but any further
ado let's go on to my favorites my hits
of the month first hit of the month and
you can see this one coming because
everyone's talking about it the sweet
peach palette by Too Faced okay as we
announced this month I'm going to be
collaborating with Too Faced on our own
little collaboration collection products
of makeup and my collection is an out
till fall this year so I kind of know
what to face has been working on and
what they're coming up with in the
future and I lost my they gave me a
little sneak peek and this palette is so
amazing one it smells like peach and it
tastes like peach and people ask me how
I know this no I did not I did I promise
I did not lick this palette I mean I
wouldn't be surprised if I did but I
didn't so when I use my peach on my brow
bone a little of the dust of the
eyeshadow went into the air here my
studio and I tasted it on my tongue and
it actually tastes like peach this
palette is just a must-have it has
amazing color pigmentation it's super
blendable it's easy to work with is a
great selection of mattes versus
shimmers and just it's everything you
want in life one of my favorite colors
is tempting because it's it's a black
but it has such a luxurious shine to it
it's such a good palette once you open
it up it fills your room with peach but
like a good peach and I'm I get this
please well if it's in stock because
constantly out of stock next up I want
to talk about the elf bronzer palette
and bronze beauty and I got this at
Target and it is just such a nice nice
bronzing palette why it's just a perfect
palette suitable for fair skin tone to
bronze with this color especially is my
favorite because with this one you can
bronze up fair skin my skin tone without
it looking muddy or gross or disgusting
this one contains a little bit of
shimmer this is a warm matte and this is
just like a kind of in-between I love
this palette all over it's great for on
models it's great for on fair skin tones
it's great for deeper skin tones it's
affordable powder is their really nice
consistency it blends out really pretty
and it's just a must-have I really
really like it another palette I've been
loving is the Oprah blush palette this
just if you have this you probably don't
need another blush for the rest of your
life because it has just such a great
variety of perfect blush colors my
favorite out of the palettes are this
one this one this one this one this one
and that one I absolutely obsess over
this palette I use it on a daily and
since I travel so much I want something
that gives me a lot of options but I
don't have to like pack a hundred
blushes so this is by far my current
favorite blush obsession oh my goodness
all my the color pop cream gel liners
are so if you've been following me for a
long long time you know that last year I
had a couple of issues with my eyes
where I couldn't handle my context
anymore and my eyes were constantly red
and bloodshot and not smoke weed do not
smoke at all I kind of felt like my eyes
were going through an evolution they
kind of like changed it became a little
bit more sensitive and since then it's
so weird but like colors on my waterline
will one tear me up like like I will get
super watery eyes and then also the
color just won't stay on that waterline
I'll just apply to the waterline and
like two seconds later gone so I haven't
really been playing with the waterline
colors anymore because they scare me
because my eyes start to water from them
but also they just don't last until
color pop came up with the cream gel
liners and
these are the only gel liners that stay
on have cool colors they have amazing
quality and they're affordable so these
are my four favorite colors the white
the black their essentials the nude and
the periwinkle blue and the periwinkle
blue is called prance and when you have
lighter or blue eyes when you put this
on a model and it will just intensify it
and make you look like say I think those
are great quality they are perfect for
the waterline even when you have
sensitive eyes and I love them another
product I've been really really liking
is by dr. Brandt and this is the pores
no more pore refine your primer I love
the entire dr. Brandt line they have
such amazing products I love their pores
no more mask their dermabrasion scrub
they're just they're top-notch for me
and I really like their products so when
I saw that they had a pore filling
primer I was like okay okay you're
coming over baby you coming over so here
on my channel I tried it out in a video
first and I was so amazed by the results
because it really it's normally with
primers like this I kind of feel like it
it clogs up the pores and makes the
pores disappear but it just looks dry
and unnourished and just clogged up
whereas with this one right here it gets
rid of the appearance of pores but yet
keeps it looking healthy smooth and
taken care of and that just amazed me
because the primer has never done that
for me and with this one it just makes
your pores disappear and makes your skin
look good so two brushes I've been
loving to apply my powder with on my
face are my morphe one is like heavy
heavy duty this will get the powder on
and it will not go throughout the day
and it will just it will get that powder
on so that is the morphe m4 for for not
only do I think this is an amazing
powder brush it is perfect for
foundation as well because it really
buffs it in but keeps the maximum
coverage of the foundation another brush
I really like and is a little bit less
hardcore but still hardcore is the
morphe 55 this is super dense super flat
but still has power so you have these
two brushes
have been amazing for powder so super
hardcore a little less hardcore and if
you use code Nicky you will get a
discount on all Morphy an eyeliner pen
I've been obsessing over is by ardency
in it's this one right here it's called
punker punk or rock on what approve
liquid liner and I'm a little bit afraid
to tell you this but I might after all
these years like this more than a calf
on D tattoo liner in trooper why I love
I'm obsessed with the brush on the
cavity one but I'm not obsessed with the
consistency because it's a little bit
too shiny and a little bit too watery
for me whereas this one it's not it's
not the same tip it's not the same brush
but it's close to it but I love the
consistency so much more because it's
like a matte black it's like in yo face
wing I will cut a bitch don't mess with
me
stay away from me you hate her eyeliner
amazing coverage it just glides on the
eye the brush is really nice it comes
with a really really really fine tip so
I used it for my liner today and I loved
it so I highly recommended and if the
tattoo liner in trooper doesn't work out
for you maybe this one will Anasazi
portfolios came out with new liquid
lipstick colors and these are my three
new favorites I've always been obsessed
with their liquid lipsticks I think
they're one of the top notch qualities
out there
my favorites are Jeffrey star Oprah and
on the South superevil hills em and
color brain these are three of the new
colors and this one right here is called
naked it's a nice warm nude you can't go
wrong here it's amazing Dulce now can we
talk about this being a Nicki color you
know I'm all about that peachy nude
e-life bright yet still nude still peach
and this is all that and crush which I
feel like is right in between the two
and added with a little bit more pink to
it and I believe that's it for my
favorites of the month I know it's not
it's not a whole lot but it's a good
bunch and it's products that I really
really believe in and really care about
and I feel like this will last me all
throughout the year and they will they
will stay with me forever so now it's
time for the moment you've all been
waiting for my
no oh yeah no my god no this month is by
ChaCha this is the gold camellia beauty
oil this beautifully packaged oil right
here retails for a prize around $90
which is crazy
you asked me it's insane I heard so many
people talk about this and I wanted to
try it because there were so many great
reviews about it but then I've had bad
experiences with oils in the past before
so I was kind of on the fence plus its
$90 so one night I sleep deprived I was
like you know what I'm gonna get that
oil no no work it out and so it came in
and I immediately tried it and you know
when you want a product to work so bad
and when you try for the first time and
it doesn't really add up to your
expectations and you're like it's okay
it's okay it's just me today tomorrow it
will work so that was me with this oil I
tried it on and like all other oils
except the hola beau one it just it just
vibrated into my skin and did absolutely
nothing it didn't feel more nourished it
just felt like a layer of oil slick I
was like I'm not giving up on you I'm
not $90 I'm not giving up on this one so
I tried it for a week straight and it
messed up with my foundation my
foundation went on patchy my foundation
didn't last as long and that's when I
came to the realization that this beauty
oil is not for me I have dry combination
skin I can get super super dry
I just outside my t-zone and my t-zone
can get quite oily um and this just
didn't do anything it just went on and
just set there and mess up my foundation
and I think for $90 I expected to make
my skin like amazeballs like I expected
to look like a glowing baby's ass and it
did not so that's it there you have it
those were my favorites and oh god no
