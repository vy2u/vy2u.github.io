March hits and God knows today because
I've been really sort of trying new
products and mainly the products that I
got in San Francisco so I'm super duper
hyped and stoked to do this today March
was great I turned 20 on the 2nd of
March and yeah so the first product I
want to talk about is de Tarte be
magnificent palette I in cheek palette I
got this in San Francisco and actually
got the last one that was available in
San Francisco because I was on Powell
and they didn't have it there and then
we called like the entire San Francisco
area if they had it and there was one
left and I chased it down and I got it
and it just has the most amazing nude
colors I like to call this sort of my
everyday palette mixed with a little bit
of like dusty so dusty colors I really
like it so we got these beautiful sort
of blending dusty mid-tone colors here
we got to highlighting colors here a
yellow tone and a pink toned we got a
blush here which is perfect for blending
out colors as well we got this beautiful
eggplant color but then we come to these
two colors right here this is a dark
brown and this is a black and the black
is literally the best black met
eyeshadow in my life ever I've never
really been a fan of like eyeshadow just
because I never found the one and now
that I have this black I found myself
using so much more black did she say
with the pastel eyes on so to be
magnificent palette by Tarte is
absolutely amazing I love it
next are the highly talked about ambient
lighting powders by hourglass I got two
colors this is ethereal light which is
sort of a really neutral light color for
really fair people and here I got
diffused light which is a little bit
warmer and a little bit more yellow to
fight redness and I heard lots and lots
of people talk about these powders on
YouTube and on blogs and just everywhere
I told you in the in the
I'm all for San Francisco but I just
walked in that Sephora on Powell and I
was like no they haven't
oh my god yeah everything else just went
on mute and I just chased the powders
and I I feel really really loving these
I love that they give you a really soft
luminous glow it's it's sort of glow
that makes you look as if you're glowing
from within as if you're like you know
like you went to thirty spots you have
30 massages and just felt great
I worried to some events this month and
everyone was like your skin is amazing
and I was like hourglass the next
product I want to talk about is the
l'oreal true match foundation and i'm
color soft ivory and one i started using
this foundation just when I started
doing makeup around like five years ago
and it's I love to foundation back then
but then I really started sort of
venturing in and trying more foundations
from different brands and everything and
five years later we meet again and five
years later I fall in love all over
again it covers so well without being
like a pancake of a layer on your skin I
love the color it's the foundation that
I'm wearing today and I think it looks
absolutely stunning it dries kind of
quickly which I like it has a soft satin
finish and yeah it's so good to be back
with my ex foundation I want to talk
about a brush where I apply all of my
foundations on with lately this is the
MEC 130 and it's a really short tiny
teeny duo fiber brush and it's so cute
and it's so good with this part I just
buffed my foundation into my skin and it
just works so well I first dot
foundation onto my skin everywhere and
then with the brush really go in and
then to get a seamless finish I take my
damn Beauty Blender and sort of go over
to sort of really give that luminous
feel but this brush is so good it's so
short and sort of packed with bristles
and it just it's like an airbrush when
apply your foundation with this brush it
just kind of looks as if you're
airbrushed your face and I've been
really loving using this brush lately
because it just it kind of gets me
stoked to using foundation whereas
before I would just go through my pro
longwear and then you know tap it in
with my damp Beauty Blender and call it
a day but now I just get really excited
to you know get my brush get my
foundation and just really buff it in
and yes of course I needed to talk about
this so this is the Becca shimmering
skin Perfector in pearl holy man
this is just glowy luminous skin magic
in one this does it all for you what I
do with the Becca shimmering skin
Perfector is I just applied to the
highest points of the face on my models
for photo shoots or on myself if I want
to feel really glowy and everything it's
just I had a photo shoot a couple of
days ago and the key inspiration for the
shoot was luminous glowy perfect skin
and I was like great now I can finally
try out my Becca shimmering skin
perfecter I tried it out on the first
girl looked absolutely fantabulous I was
like okay that's just one girl it looks
good on it probably won't look good on
all of my girls so I put it on my second
model on my third model my fourth model
I can't even tell you
they looked glowy luminous stunning
perfect eye I mean just look at the
pictures they look stunning no words and
if you want to see this in action I use
it in my Lady gaga GUI makeup tutorial
the first one and you can hear me freak
out over it they're a blush I've been
loving this month is by Tarte and this
is the Amazonian clay 12-hour blush in a
dull face and I also got this in San
Francisco I'm sorry am I wearing it on
my cheeks today really lightly and it's
just a perfect sort of bright pop of
pink and I love how this just gives you
that flush of pink and just looks really
healthy and can you tell that Mart has
been all about looking radiant and
healthy and glowy for me kind of in an
obsession I'm sorry a liquid eyeliner
that I've been obsessing over is mica
treats
this is the liquid liner water proven
this is another product that I've used
in the past and kinda broke up with it
because I wanted to try new products and
kind of forgot about it and then a
couple of weeks ago I went to looks by
sharing a great friend of mine /
youtuber and she uses this every day as
her eyeliner and just look stunning on
her
and that kind of you know sparkled up
that inner love for it in me I was not
good I bought it I tried it fell in love
all over again
and it's just like have you been I'm
wearing it as my eyeliner today it stays
on all day it's a little bit shiny which
I like matte eyeliner more but hey for
like three euros I can live with that
this mascara right here is the Mac
extended play gigablack lash
tongue-twister I got this because of
Lisa Eldridge because she did a full
video on eyeliners and mascaras and all
that and she raved about this and it was
like hey I can get that here so I'm
gonna get it it's just totally right
about it it's super super small and
skinny which really allows you to get to
the roots of your lashes and really work
that mascara in and we're really loving
it for lower lashes I'm really sort of
like darkening up my roots and it stays
on like a dream it doesn't get off you
need you need a good makeup remover with
it this is the Shona gentle buddy
exfoliant and I mean look at the
packaging it's just it's one wins wins
won the smoothness exfoliant is Kokomo's
L which is one of my favorites from
Chanel and it's just a body scrub and oh
god it smells so good it's great for
before you shave your legs if you scrub
your legs before you shave them you will
actually get a closer shave so I'm using
it for dad it's just the smell the scent
smell scent scent smell the next thing
is a perfume my Viktor &amp;amp; Rolf and this
is called bonbon and I have no idea
because it looks like
tithe I would like to call it so why
it's called a bond mama I don't know
it's SuperDuper sweet it's SuperDuper
sweet it's um it's leaves are sort of
like vanilla II flowery sugary scent
it's just sort of all the amazing sweet
scents on this planet Earth combined
into one and the last hit for this month
is again I had this last month as well
it's RuPaul's Drag Race Season six I am
loving the season so far I did a full
blog post on my top 14 so who I think
should win snatch the crown and who I
think should go home already my top
three favorite so far definitely our
milk Bianca and adore just like an icon
like icon oh yeah if you want to know
what my top 14 of RuPaul's Drag Race
Season 6 is then definitely go check out
the link down below in the infobox time
for someone God knows oh yeah know
someone recently told me that whenever
there's a hype and people seem to love
it
I seem to be the only one putting it in
there oh god knows
I don't know why that is I'm not doing
it on purpose but today is another day
where is it gonna happen
so my first I got now for this month is
the nsa's that dip brow pomade and
blonde I just hear all the hearts
breaking I see so many people using this
like they're drugged and I see like the
perfect brows with them and as soon as I
start playing with it I just I look
wrong my brows look like my entire
face looks like because my brows
look like first of all they need to
sort of add some colors because if this
is blonde why are we on this earth it's
way too warm and warm for a blonde
except if you're like darker haired or
more gingery than me but other than that
for like ash blonde girls doesn't work
and second of all when I
like this it just it went on really
sheer and then when you apply more you
get like sort of stains and it's darker
in one spot and lighter in the other
spot
it applies so uneasily and maybe it
works for people who have like full
brows but because I don't have a whole
lot of hairs going on there it kind of
sort of makes it even more obvious that
I don't have a lot of hairs upstairs no
damn girl no Angeles oh god no for this
month is another sort of much we talked
about product it's do your Medicaid all
about your spray I really don't get a
lot of heights on the internet and this
is one of them people have told me to
use this fall in love with it forever
easy and that's it I tried it in San
Francisco's to the Alcatraz party I gave
it like five or six hours and I had to
powder I had to do like stuff with my
skin to make it look good again maybe
I'm doing something wrong I shook the
hell out of it I sprayed it in the in
the tea I sprayed it in the X and then I
sprayed a little bit more and just know
so if someone has the magic trick to
make this work because I really want
these are God knows this month to work
for me and then tell me tell me because
I don't know and that's it for this
month of March
