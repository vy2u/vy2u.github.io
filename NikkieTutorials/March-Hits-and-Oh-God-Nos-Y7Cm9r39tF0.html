my March hits and oh god knows and I'm
really excited because March was my
month of birth I didn't give birth but I
was birthed at myself by my mother 19
years ago
anyway this month the 2nd of March
what's my birthday so March immediately
was perfect to me and um so yes today I
am here to show you my hips and Oh God
knows and if you want to know what is on
my list to today this month then please
keep on watching so this month I don't
know what came into me but I was
obsessed with glowy skin and it all kind
of started a couple of weeks ago when I
did a tutorial for efficient ESET
magazine where I had to do a glowy skin
tutorial sort of like a JLo tutorial JLo
glow tutorial and I had to use all these
glowy products I'm making my skin look
like a million bucks and ever since I've
been like I want to look like this every
single day products that I've used for
that and which I love are sort of like
face primers but they're not actually
primers they're sort of like
illuminators the first one I really like
is by Mac and this is called the strobe
cream and what this is is sort of like a
white cream with a pinky sort of sheen
in it which you cannot see at all you
see it it's absolutely gorgeous and this
just gives you that look like you're
glowing from within like you're pregnant
or or like you're at the best night of
your life last night or both then
another illuminator that I really like
is by NARS and this is the orgasm
illuminator kind of ties in to what it
just said so this is orgasm illuminator
and this is so stunning and I use this
more for when I want to look like I've
been to the beach and sort of have that
sunny healthy glow so from within and
sort of I went to the beach and had an
amazing day and caught some UV oh thing
to further enhance that glowy skin I am
in love with these two blushes by NARS
the first one is a sex appeal and if I
can open it this is sex appeal and it is
just such a really natural peachy
neutral color in the pot it doesn't look
like that much but when you put it on
your face you just look so natural and
healthy again as if you're glowing from
within as if the color is coming from
within is absolutely starting I'm
wearing it today and I love it and then
another one that I love is orgasm again
but this is the blush form so this is
orgasm in the illuminator form and this
is the blush form so you can see that
this is way more bronze and this is way
more pink everyone has been talking
about it and like the entire internet
had like dupes for it and other products
that looked like it and I was like I
want the real deal for once
so I splurged and I gave in and I bought
the orgasm blush right now by not by
NARS and I love it it's definitely worth
the hype it's glowy it's healthy and
this will fit so many skin colors and
then to kind of finish off the glow on
my face I've been using vanilla pigment
by Mac on my cheekbones and on my the
bridge of my nose and sort of like my
Cupid's bow and this is stunning it is
so I've had this this is the beginning
of my sort of starting to get into
makeup career and then a really good
friend of mine slash makeup artist and
hair artist who I work with a lot is
Joyce Joyce clerics and she uses this
all the time and every time she wears it
a Mike it look so gorgeous again she's
like dogs vanilla and every time I see
her I want to put vanilla all over my
face so today I did and I absolutely
love the outcome it's on my cheekbones
from the highest points of my face and I
love vanilla
so these together are like the perfect
glowy skin I love these and also
reasonably my favorite skincare brand
Hannah or Hannah came out with this
serum and this is called the opulence
serum and I have to tell you that this
is the packaging from people who use it
in their salons this is for my mom
because my mom had it already and I
wanted to try it so bad so I just
grabbed it I'm giving it back I'm giving
it back it's just I needed this for the
video this serum is geared towards
improving like a discoloration in your
face like if you have some discoloration
from scars or from acne or whatever this
serum is geared towards that and when
you put
that's on your face it feels like an
angel is pissing on you the skin kind of
absorbs it in such a nice way that you
just feel so moisturized and fresh and
sort of like taken care of so I
absolutely la la love the opulent serum
my mom sells it in her webshop hence go
sweets gihan el and for my duchies at
hana i NL three lipsticks that i've been
loving this month are two by YSL you
Sanwa and the first one is this rouge
volupte pearl and this is number I have
no idea I'm going to do some research
and then put it on my blog
nikkietutorials calm but I'm wearing
this right now it's so glassy neutral
healthy and the packaging when I grow up
I want this to be my house another
Easton law lipstick that I love is this
number six Rouge pur Couture and I've
been wearing this in quite a lot of
videos of mine lately I've worn it in
the the Good Witch of the south from the
oz tutorial and people told me they
loved it on me
and when people tell me they love
something on me I'm like okay that I
love it on myself as well and then a
bright color that I've been loving this
month is this OCC lip tar in Queen and
ever since I went to New York last year
and we met me and jf met make up our ISA
she's amazing she wore this when we met
her and I just couldn't stop staring at
it and I I loved it and ever since I've
been a huge huge fan of Queen Letarte
and the last thing I have for you guys
is a fixed plus by Mac I've been using
this for 2-3 months now to set my entire
face to kind of get rid of the powdery
look I personally tend to look powdery
quite quick because I like to pack on
that powder like no one when I take my
powder I just pack it on like a marui
post-rock rate so in order to make
myself look natural and glowy again I
took my fixed blush take a huge
stippling brush and just stipple all
over my face and then I look nice and
glowy again and with this I want to
state that the words of this video are
glowy natural neutral and love
I really so those were my Beauty it's
this month I also really want to share
my favorite album this month
music is by Bassel bat blood I fudging
love this Bend I cannot describe what I
feel for this band I kind of feel like I
they feel like they're a part of me
because dare music is so good the voice
of Dan the lead singer is insane my
favorite song is Laura Palmer love it
the EBI rope version and the normal
version I think I like the every rope
version a little bit better but Laura
Palmer check them out by their album bad
blood and my favorite TV show this month
was true puss drag race because nothing
beats RuPaul's Drag Race nothing you can
have the following you can have to walk
and dad you can have Dexter get Thrones
nothing beats the shade the glamour the
fakeness the they make up their own
words and nothing just beats RuPaul's
laugh so that was it for my hits this
month of March now let's go to my own
god knows oh yeah no I don't have any
I'm sorry I don't know what March did to
me this month but I just couldn't hate
on anything I just I loved everything
this month the only thing I can call a
oh god no this month is the Dutch
weather it's it's insane it drives me
crazy it looks like it's really hot
outside but it just feels like minus 114
ah I just I think just like one happy
bubble this month I'm sorry I i kinda
knowing myself as well I don't get it so
