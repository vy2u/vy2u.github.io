hey guys so today I am doing a tutorial
on marina and the diamonds prima donnas
makeup tutorial other than deputy music
video oh I absolutely loved the music
video for prima donna so today I am
going to show you how to get her
signature look lately with the bottom
lashes and stuff um so yeah I know some
of you are like falling off their chairs
and breaking their hips and stuff over
this look because they either hate it or
they love it I love it if you don't like
this then I don't know if you want to
know how to get this marina in the
diamonds look then please keep on
watching
so the first thing you want to do is
apply a base tear eyelids to print the
items were creasing and the one I'm
using is soft ochre Paint Pot from Mac
yeah oh my god I'm going to take these
two eyeshadows by Mac called copper
plate and mystery and I'm going to start
off with applying mystery to my bottom
lash line and blending it out and then
you're going to take mystery and wing it
out just really make it a wing out of
your eye and then I'm going to take a
bit more and what I'm going to do is go
into my crease with it as well now
that's not the only thing I'm going to
do I'm also going to go onto my lash
line now I'm going to take copper plate
and blend that even further into the
crease I'm going to take a bit more of
copper plate and blend that on the lower
lash line to make it a little bit softer
and I'm going to take max kid eyes
shadow and mix with copper plate I'm
just going to make this softer and blend
it out while I do that I kind of brush
the eyeshadow out in a wing to you to
really give it that lift to the eye and
just keep blending it until it has the
softness that you like now I'm going to
take max vapor and chamomile and mix the
two together and I'm going to apply the
two to my eyelid and the inner corner
for a nice eye opener now I'm going to
take my set in taupe and apply that to
like the middle of the lid blending it
with the dark part and blending into the
light heart I love settings hopes that
in taupe is like oh goodness gracious
back with your mystery I'm quickly going
to highlight my inner corners with
whatever highlight color that I had
to just take a nice shimmery
highlighting color and highlight those
inner corners right there
eyeliner time and the eyeliner i'm using
is mac's blacktrack fluid line and i'm
just going to use an eyeliner brush
we're going to make as usual the line
where I want the like wing to go to and
then basically all I'm going to do is go
in and make it an eyeliner you don't
want to make it too thick because all
the attention needs to go to those crazy
bottom lashes and that's you the
eyeliner
for my waterline I'm going to take max
PowerSearch eye Kohl all I'm going to do
now is curl your lashes with your
eyelash curler and apply mascara to your
top lashes only and the one I'm using is
makeup Studios 3d wanna prove extra
black favorite mascara ever up for the
heart oh I did is if you want to do that
right now is take a black eye Kohl this
is Lancome
black and just make a heart shaped like
mole there and then apply some liquid
eyeliner to make it waterproof so that
is all the lashes are going to be using
on number 43 by Mac
you
of your fertile lips I'm first going to
apply a nice bright like babydoll a pink
lip pencil to the lips to give it a nice
stain and then on top I'm going to apply
Mac's budding love lipstick let's make
it a little less purple I'm going to
take Mac's Viva Glam one and blend that
through and that completes this Marina
