today I'm gonna tell you who are the
winners of my masquerade ball contest I
have the winners it took me two months
to get those freaking winners the judges
helped me a lot because I narrowed it
down to like my 15 favorites and then I
took the names of the judges and I
looked if they respond it and the person
with the most votes won that's it so
after two months I'm not gonna tell my
favorites because I always feel so bad
when they call my name is a favorite but
I didn't win anything I'm like okay I'm
your favorite what didn't I win anything
so I'm not gonna tell any of my favorite
I did have a lot of favorites like over
20 amazing oh by the way I got 95 95
entries also wanna thank all my
subscribers for subscribing because feed
past eight but anyway um on to the
winners right so let's start off with
prize number three the third place
winner and this one was for the best
smokey eye now what I loved about this
winner was that she had bright booming
colors and glitters and oh my god
prettiness
and she turned it to a match the small a
corresponding mask great I loved it so
the winner for the smokey eye
both to totally 2:07 congratulations
girl and let's go on to the masked
winner pretty mess winner this girl had
some votes
she really had and I love her I know her
but don't think I let her win this
because I know her this is so did not
think I love this girl win because I
know her
no she won because she's freaking as
talented and her mask rock so the winner
the second-place winner the winner of
the best mask goes to X being me on X
everyone did such an amazing job
oh my god for the grand prize winner a
grand prize winner
this girl was pretty much in everyone's
favorites I had as a favorite
almost all the judges had an s favorites
so her smoky eye was pretty and her mask
blew me away
it blew me away I was like okay now pull
it off because I thought she had put
some plastic on her face and she took it
off to show her real Matt but I was like
when is she gonna take it out she wasn't
taking it off because it was her mask so
the grand prize winner of the masquerade
ball contest hosted by nikkietutorials
if the winner is Kitty Rhea I loved it I
loved it loved it loved it
and pretty much all the judges hat you
in their favorites so I'm gonna put all
the wings to the winners in the slide
bar after three days because I don't
want them to look and oh that's number
of years
I'm gonna watch this video anymore so
after three days I'm gonna pursuing
student winners on a sidebar and I want
to congratulate everyone all the winners
please contact me send me a message
through YouTube and everything will come
to its right and 40 random plates winner
because I was missing in action I did
not forget about this what I actually
did was two months ago or when the
contest ended I hit up someone from the
contact list and I told them you are the
red winner because I was like ok I have
these three winners and I cannot do a
video about them because I'm busy but
what I can do is contact the random
winner and tell that person that she won
so we already have a random winner so
all the other three winners contact me
please and if you have any questions
about why I picked those or any of that
I don't want hateful comments like oh
she was so much better though uh you
have your own opinion and I only want
your opinion if it's nicely said so
thanks for watching congratulations to
the winners and I will try to do more
videos I've been so busy but I'm back
ish so yeah thanks for watching like</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
