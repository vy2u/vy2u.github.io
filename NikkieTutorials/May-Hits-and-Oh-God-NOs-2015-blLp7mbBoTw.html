oh god knows it's great to be here once
again
once more yes I did film a makeup
tutorial on the look I'm wearing today
this will be going up Wednesday 1 p.m.
Pacific sender time and 4 p.m. Eastern
sender times yeah without any further
ado I've got lots of fun products to
talk about today so let's get to it
alright so the first hit I want to talk
about and I wanted to include this in
the previous hits and God knows I
actually put it in my thumbnail as well
but I just forgot to talk about it
that's how my brain works the first
product I want to talk about is decaf
Andy shade and light palette I've been
obsessing over this to step over to a
new product to contour with was like I'm
kinda I'm cheating it's like I'm having
an affair on my contour powder so the
caveny shade and light palette is
awesome for contouring I cannot use it
for highlighting simply because all the
colors in here are too dark the
highlighting colors in here are too dark
for my skin tone I've used it others not
for myself but the contour shades are
the shiznit because these two right here
are perfect to contour with I find this
one to be a little bit too dark for me
it's great for others not me but
especially this shade right here has
been loving to use for my contour I'm
wearing it as my contour today it is a
very pigmented powder you have to go
very light hand it with it today I went
a little bit more strong handed but just
other than that it's a great palette I
just love the packaging I love Kat Von D
I love her products and this is no other
okay the next product is my honest also
bravely Hills this is the artist palette
and you guys seen this a lot of YouTube
lately because everyone and their mama
have been using it so this is what the
palette looks like it has a bunch of
bright colors neutrals and darks and
that is exactly my makeup style I love
bright colors but pairing it up with
neutrals and darker colors basically
when this came out I was like huh - no I
created a palette with her I just really
really enjoy this palette my favorite
colors in the palette are
this orange color here this yellow one
this aubergine one this one all of them
it's just a really great palette the
eyeshadows are great there are just as
great as the individual eyeshadows that
honest last day of cells and gray
palette I believe it's a limited edition
so if you want to get it that'd be quick
girl next up is this Col Gendo High
Definition aqua foundation I got this
from a friend because I did not know
where to get this from and now that I
have it in my life it is one of the best
foundations I have ever tried in my
entire life it just makes your skin look
so photoshopped gorgeous but without
Photoshop and it just it makes you
filtered the foot but still like pretty
and I love this I love mixing this
foundation with my Mac Studio Fix fluid
but alone by itself it's great also it's
just a very very beautiful foundation
and I recommend it to everyone
next up also by Anastasia Beverly Hills
are the cream waterproof cream colors
she came out with a bunch of fun colors
for summer and my three favorites that
she came out with are Barbie pink pink
eyeliner who doesn't love that ice blue
which I've used in my ombre eyeliner
ombre eyeliner tutorial and this yellow
oh my god I love the yellow I never
thought that I would love a yellow
eyeliner it happened
so these waterproof cream colors by
Anastasia Beverly Hills are just a very
very great gel eyeliner they can be
drying at some time so what I like to do
is just take any oil I use my inglot
duraline to just pop in a couple of
drops make the entire gel liner moist to
just make the eyeliner moist and easy to
work with again and then they are super
easy to work with so they can be a
little bit drying but if you just use
some oil or like in cloths duraline they
are super easy to work with I love the
colors yes next up is a payment that
I've been adoring I was watching this
video on ghalichi glam and they did this
transformation on Trisha Paytas
paid off the boobie girl the girl with
the delicious knockers Trisha
we all know Trisha so they did a
makeover on her and this makeup artists
use the Inglot pigment body pigment in
180 on her eyelids and I was that quiet
don't I have that in my collection
somewhere and I found it so ever since
I've seen that video on Trisha and the
makeover I've been using this so much on
my eyelids I'm wearing it on my eyelids
today so that Sheen the glistening is
180 by Inglot and it's just a beautiful
pigment you can use it to highlight the
skin with it's great for on the lid
inner corners it's just a beautiful
pigment and hence up for Trisha Paytas
for introducing me to it again next up
is the NYX natural lip pencil I love
over drawing my lips because I love the
lips shebang and so I've been using
Mac's stripped down
Mac's oak and I just found the
immaculate pencils who go on a little
bit hard they just didn't distribute the
color evenly and it was just a tiny bit
harder to work with them but then I got
the NYX lip pencil in natural and this
is so easy to work with it distributes
color so easily with the slightest touch
on the skin it's just a beautiful color
I use it to line my lips today I need a
touch-up say I'm wearing the lip pencil
on my lips today overtop I have an
honest lots of roughly Hales liquid
lipstick you will see it in the tutorial
on Wednesday but this is just a great
lip pencil I've been using it so much
for over lining my lips and just giving
myself that depth and definition plus
it's so much more cheaper than max lip
pencil so I know what I'll be getting
next ones are yes coloured raine
recently came out with a new liquid
lipstick color this is Mars and I am
dying over this is just a typical
beautiful dark nude matte color I've
done a couple of posts on my Instagram
where I show this I've done that you
like a detailed lip swatch video so this
is Mars and if you want to buy a
coloring liquid lipsticks I have a
discount code for you that is
nikkietutorials the same way it's
spelled on my channel and then you will
get
10% off who does live discount code next
up is a blush by Guerlain and oh I got
this again because of watching that
Trisha Paytas pay pay Trisha I got this
again because I watched that Trisha
transformation video and ghalichi glam
and they use the blush peach boy by
Guerlain on Trisha this is not peach boy
this is golden hi I went out and ordered
two blushes peach boy the one they use
on Trisha and this one golden hi and oh
my god I love it first of all the scent
of these blushes is amazing because they
smell like a flowery garden so this is
golden hi and I love using this color
right here for just a natural everyday
flesh of blush and then this darker
shimmery color right here is perfect you
give yourself a nice of luminous bronze
they feel it's just a it's a beautiful
blush I love it it smells amazing I
really like it it's expensive which
shucks shucks it is expensive but it is
so beautiful I love it so much
I've been wearing this on a daily basis
especially this color right here and I'm
really enjoying this and last but not
least hustle flashes came out with a new
eyelash glue
I've always been an amazing fan of the
regular eyelash glue it's the only
eyelash clue I use I swear by this stuff
and then this is the clear version but
people you know people always demanding
for more so they came out with a black
version and I know it looks like a
beautiful jewel chrome green on camera
this apply is green like a dark dark
shimmering green but it dries black
isn't that amazing I'm so fascinated by
it because when you apply this one the
clear one goes on white then it becomes
this like translucent green duochrome
and then it goes clear and this one is
like a shimmering midnight green and
then once it dries it's so the Hutt's of
lashes eyelash glue is my favorite
eyelash glue of life ever nothing will
break this bond between us see if you've
always wanted the House of lashes
eyelash glue in black they have
Wow so those were all my hits for the
month of May let's go on to my oh god no
