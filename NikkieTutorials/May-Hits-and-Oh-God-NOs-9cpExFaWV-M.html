my um hey guys so today I'm here to
bring you my may favorites and may has
been such a diverse month that I I don't
really know like so much like ha so many
things happen to me and a lot of
favorites occurred and went and got back
and went again
so the first favorite this month is my
Mac and this is called the full coverage
foundation in number
w10 for some reason when I started
learning English I always thought that w
was we but I always said I have to go to
do we see okay so my first favorite this
month is DW 10 full coverage foundation
by Mac and I use this to highlight my
face because as we watching a lot of
RuPaul's Drag Race and I see them like
contouring so heavily and something in
your brain should tell you you shouldn't
do that you shouldn't copy that look and
my brain just felt like I need to do
that every day in my life because deep
down we all want to be a drag queen
so to w10 full coverage foundation is
the lightest shade that mech has except
for white and I thought white was a
little bit too extreme if you know what
I mean and this is perfect because I use
it like to contour my face and to
highlight my nose and to just brighten
up my face and contour a bit another
concealer I've been loving by Mac is the
pro longwear concealer and this is about
my fourth like thing I bought and this
is in nw15 which is the lightest shade
of that you have NC 15 and wo 50 it's as
well so you have MC 15 and and W 15 and
there's a siren and there's like alarms
outside right now I've been loving this
and I use this under my eyes to conceal
plus it's the only concealer that
doesn't crease on my eyes normally
concealers just settle in those fine
lines I'm 19 I already I find that's
pathetic but the pro longwear can see
or doesn't do it the color play
lipsticks biting glod and I did a full
blog post review on this so if you want
to see swatches all my lips and all my
arms on these lipsticks then go to my
website Nagisa toriel's calm and I will
put the link down below plus I get some
fancy sort of lip art with it like a
rainbow lip and I had so much fun with
this this is a lifesaver for makeup
artists who love to play with colours or
if you're someone who loves like bright
lips or if you're trying to follow the
JLo trend with her yellow lips and live
it up which I hate by the way I hate
that new song of JLo here's your first
oh god no JLo
go put that in your big bottom behind I
will not live it up No so this is great
for if you're like a lipstick lover if
you like bright colors if you like
different colors if you like to do some
lip art if you like to mix and match and
it's just a great great palette and I
like ours be loving is by Maybelline and
this is the eye studio lasting drama gel
liner 24 hours in black I wish I had
this in brown because I'm a more I'm
like on personally on myself
I like brown eyeliner better than black
um I'm wearing it today is a winged
eyeliner it is stunning it is better
than max gel eyeliner in black check in
my opinion because max gel eyeliner
tends to get dry really fast plus it
it's not that opaque as it seems in the
pot not to take things off your face
it's really important at night because
if you leave your makeup on at night
trust me you will have a bad time so
what I love to take my eye makeup of is
dip a professional makeup remover by
jpay and my mom sells this interruption
of ethical smooth guys dot the nail and
I'd love this there hasn't been another
thing in my life that is better than
this to take my eye makeup off I put
 loads of eye makeup on so I need
something that is able to take all that
 off it's for all skin types for
sensitive eyes owns and it's hypo
elegant or genji genic and this is by
far the best eye makeup remover I have
ever
countered and I love it and I recommend
it to every one on this planet to know
polishes I absolutely adored this month
are the China Glaze surf in for boys and
this is insane it's it's like a neon
coral with like a pink sheen with like
gold and like bright pink and it's it's
SuperDuper awesome it's neon in some
light it's coral in some it's orange and
in some way it's pink and when you go on
the street people are like I need that
and the new polish I'm about to talk
about it's still my heart like it ripped
it out of my rip case ripped case said
work it ate it up like like it's not
like Lady Gaga says that boy is a
monster it's like that nail polish is a
monster he ate my heart
this is Chanel's nail polish in a due
date was that right it's probably Azure
azu day or a zoo day
or is something completely different of
course and I did a blog post review on
this as well I put that up like three
days ago so you can still find it on the
homepage and um this nail polish can we
talk about this I'm already talking
about it it's like duochrome
blue heaven get this a huge favorite
this month was my Mac nude onboard
bronzer my pro longwear nude on board
bronzer also did a blog post review on
that down below down below go ahead
click that link I can't describe my love
for it I use this on my session mode 4.0
new neons shoot which is also on my blog
right now I did so many things on my
blog lately noon on board bronzer is
just perfect for pale ladies like me
pill guys pill whatever's it's natural
it's warm it's perfect for fair ladies
and I feel like this has got to be like
one of the best bronzers Mac ever came
out with I love I love this check out
the review on my blog posts I've used
this on shoots I've used this on myself
I'm Randy today and I feel so damn
fabulous with
and it's amazing and I should have
bought at least four backups and I only
got one I'm about to embark on something
that a lot of you are gonna hate and I'm
gonna feel like such a stereotypical
beauty guru I kind of talk about candles
I'm about to embark on that same journey
I'm about to talk about a candle but
first I want to talk about this
hairspray this is my gold well and this
is the texture style what does that say
sprayer in hair number five I love this
it's one of the best hair space ever
because it's so hard
hold like it holds really well and I
just uh I love it the smell isn't that
great but I love it and it's it really
holds stuff okay back to the candle um
the candle I'm going to talk about it's
the Kobo candle and I actually have two
and I finished my first one almost all
the way and this is by Kobo and this is
the vut iver and shaved vanilla and when
someone tells me shaved vanilla I'm like
how the hell do you shave vanilla this
is vut iver golden amber and vanilla and
it's a pure soy candle and I love this
 this it's golf mmm
this is the Kobo candle in a poppin ox
amber a poppin ox amber and it has
sandalwood violet and patchouli in it
and again it's a pure soy candle and and
you take the lid off and the lids are
actually pretty cute and then you have
your Kobo candle like that and then the
lid and then you take that part out and
then you light it and um with this one I
think I had like a month and a half of
fire but I have a couple of random
things my favorite song of May is the
Lana Del Rey's young and beautiful holy
 that song is gorgeous I might want
to have it when I die on like my funeral
ISM
I don't know if that's a good thing but
I love that song so much and that brings
me to the Great Gatsby I've been to the
movie and I've absolutely loved watching
it and the soundtrack album is insanely
good as well if you're like in the mood
for serve like like vintage retro music
was like a 2013 boom in it then go get
the Great Gatsby soundtrack album
another great song of that album is bang
bang by will.i.am love that song then
then a TV show that I've been loving
this month is Game of Thrones Khaleesi
Khaleesi ah I just wish that the
Khaleesi just I love that bitch I love
that I love her so much like with her
blonde hair and she's so gorgeous and
then she's like goddess okay so onto my
Oh God knows this month and uh onto my
oh god knows this month
oh yeah no so the phrase oh god no is my
hair I did again I did a full blog post
on this um I had like bright pink hair
for a week in May because you can still
see some right here that's the only part
that doesn't want to come out basically
if you want to know the entire story go
to my blog post I will put a link below
and on my website and everything but
basically I went to my hair stylist to
get my hair done for a tutorial I wanted
to do a wreck-it Ralph
tutorial inspired by the sugar rush land
where vanellope lives and I wanted to do
like I didn't want a wig and I didn't
want to do like the color bug dip dye I
wanted something like strong but I
wanted it to be thought I wanted baby
pink hair and I and I and I went home
like a cotton candy and basically what I
did now is I got um Manic Panic hair
dyes to do it myself so um at least I
can blame myself when it goes wrong and
not my hairstylist so the only thing I
will do at the hairstylist now is get my
roots done and trim
a bit but for coloring wise it's all on
me now and girl no another oh god no
this month was by chroma beauty or I
should say Kardashian beauty right now
because it changed the name and this is
the golden makeup priming jelly um so
it's sort of like a priming gel for your
face and for your face and I was like
well that's like a fun packaging I was
like that's the fun that's so car - but
then I open it and basically it's like
glitter like like bright gold glitter
and look at that it's like glitter to
the max and it's like yellow it's like
it like sort of like a piss colored
yellow the Kardashians don't put glitter
on their face like that they know so
basically I was like who is gonna put
this on their face people should not use
this on their faces because you will
look like a shining disco ball that
concludes my May hits and oh god knows
and I loved me it was hectic it was pink
the hair it was it was different it was
it was diverse and it was fun for a full
list of every single product mentioned
go to my website need to Toral's calm
and I'm really sort of putting more
effort into Nikita Torres calm so check
back every day to see if I put something
new up like a blog post review or
something you can hold him on Twitter

Instagram Facebook and fine and I
believe I have keek as well what else do
