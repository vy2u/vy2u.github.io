the end of May so that means it's time
for my hits and God knows and yeah I
have heard so many amazing things about
the butter glosses by NYX uh-huh finally
someone getting on the bandwagon here
too and a couple of weeks ago I was like
I'm done with it I gotta try them out
for myself - I ordered about 12 and I
have a couple of favorites the first one
I'm going to talk about is creme brulee
the one everyone has as a favor this is
just the perfect sort of neutral nude
color it's it's not too pink it's not
too beige it's not too dark it's not too
light it's the perfect nude glossy color
and can we just talk about the smell of
these Oh it's like cookies and vanilla
and just pastries and oh my god the next
I have devil's food cake which is a
really dark wine red color I absolutely
love this and I'm gonna do a tutorial
with this really soon because I'm loving
the wine lip trend lately the one I'm
wearing right now is a sugar cookie and
I'm wearing sugar cookie on top of LMSs
matte lip liquid in forbidden dove this
combo is on me and I am not kidding it
al has but at least I have apple strudel
struggle strudel opted to does and this
is sort of pink lemonade lip glass by
Mac but just a little bit more funky and
bright and perfect for summer and spring
and just - all year round because I love
colors like this I absolutely love the
butter glosses because they smell then
freaking tabloids they say on really
well I did not expect them to stay on
really well they they stay on very good
they're sticky but not too sticky
they're just your normal type sticky
nothing but love for these next I want
to talk about a benefit product this is
what's up another product finally
hopping onto the damn bandwagon
I'm obviously to the party oh this is
what's up and this is a liquid to powder
highlighter and unwearied
or mosses to do Oh someone told me to
not say fess because in French that
means ass I like having an ass for a
face no so the product comes in here so
you have to twist it up and it's like a
stick form and it's just the most
beautiful
champagne e gold shine it just
transforms your entire face into this
dewy goddess goodness I love that it
starts creamy because you can really
pack it on and build it in and then once
it dries in it settles in it just looks
amazing and it doesn't go anywhere
well little note I do have for benefit
though is get rid of the damn sponge
because ain't nobody using that nobody
next I want to talk about the Catrice
cosmetics liquid liner in dating Joe
black and I don't know if I talked about
the waterproof version before um I used
to obsess over that and I actually wrote
a blog post on that as well and in the
blog post people told me like a girl get
the dating Joe black which is a matte
one and it just stays on even better
than a waterproof which is kind of weird
because when a brand tells you that it
is waterproof and then the non
waterproof works better that's kind of
weird
I'm wearing it as my eyeliner today it
has been my Holy Grail eyeliner for like
the couple of last month's weeks don't
lie I've only had it for a couple of
weeks it is smooth it is black as
Kristen Stewart's heart it is so black
it's super duper matte it almost looks
like chalk but then the good chalk like
fashion chalk the good chalk the fancy
chalk it stays on like a a dream like I
can't even tell you get this what I'm
now going to talk about has touched my
heart remember a couple of videos ago
where I asked you all to tweet
Illamasqua using the hashtag safe
disobey for us or for deke or whatever
just save disobey how many tweets got
tweeted and and we did not get a
response from Illamasqua
so I was like they're ignoring us I kind
of in my heart you know accepted that
disobey was gonna go until last week I
got an email and the title of the email
was save disobey we obeyed and that was
an email from Illamasqua and what they
were telling me is that they're bringing
back their undiscussed
disobeyed blush bronzer or whatever a
powder blusher it's a bronzer for me but
it's blot
they're bringing it back because of all
of your tweets our demand of wanting it
back worked disobey is now back in in
illamasqua stores Plus online and let me
tell you stock up on this baby because
it is the best bronzer for a pill people
out there and I'm so so glad that they
brought it back and I love you Alan Eska
I love you for that I've been obsessing
over makeup geek pigments lately and
especially utopia and afterglow utopia
is just a magic pigment in a bottle you
can't really describe the color either
it's sort of an antique gold greeny
silvery glittery amazingness
I feel loving utopia and I'm smearing
this all over my face when I'm going to
a party or going out to like with
friends it's just an amazing sort of
party pigment and I've been loving
afterglow for like my neutral days for
like a nice subtle sheen on the lid and
I highlight my face with it as well
these two pigments by makeup geek are
absolutely fantastic and I am writing a
review on them soon and I will put links
down below on where you can get this and
while we're talking about the brand
makeup geek I am loving their brand so
much that I um got this neutral palette
filled with makeup geek shadows only and
I've been gravitating towards this
palette so much lately
it doesn't sell like this I put this all
together myself but just a few
eyeshadows that I've been obsessing over
lately and using so much on myself
models clients everyone I love Coco bear
it's like they're perfect warm brown to
really sort of get that blue out of
someone's eyes this is latte and
everyone has to have this because it's
the perfect sort of brownie color for in
the crease it's not to warrants not to
cool toned it's absolutely perfect and
this color right here has been my
favorite for an entire month now this is
goddess and this is sort of a coppery
champagne a neutral bright color it's
just this perfect mix of copper and gold
and neutral and I'm wearing it on my
lids today and in a couple of other
videos at throughout this month and just
goddess is by far right now my face
for makeup geek eyeshadow I want to talk
about zoeva brushes again because I
ordered a couple of new ones
this is the zoeva cream shader 233 and I
use this to tighten up and sharpen a
line for the longest time I used a
really short and precise brush to clean
up my lip line and make it all sharp and
and you know perfect but it was until
recently then I bumped into the 233 but
the cream shader by Ziva and I did step
to sort of clean up and sharpen up the
edges of my lips it's the best lip
cleanup brush ever and then a Mac brush
that I've been loving is C 212 and I got
this because of Jaclyn hill I've been
having a Jaclyn hill obsession lately I
love her videos her way of talking her
eyes her lighting her camera her set up
her everything and I watched her broad
tutorial and she did the carving out of
the eyebrow sort of cleaning up the
eyebrows with this brush right here to
212 by Mac and ever since I've seen that
video I tried that myself for my brows
and I am loving it use way less
concealer because this picks up so many
concealer without actually picking up a
lot of concealer it just glides on so
well and it just makes your eyebrows so
pretty and so carved out and so precise
and perfect and Thank You Jacqueline
thank you for the recommendation
although she used the Sigma brush and
I'm using Mac right here I have the
Smashbox always sharp waterproof coal
liner in raisin and I've had this bad
boy for a while now but I never really
you know gravitated towards it until a
couple of weeks ago where I wanted some
black in my eyes and I put it there and
it stayed on perfectly throughout the
entire day I did not need touch-ups I
did not you know need to tidy up things
it looked perfect and black and Raven
ish throughout the entire day and a fun
thing is that you don't have to sharpen
it it's called always sharp you can use
it like this and it has a sharp point
and then once you go back into the lid
you twisted once and Depp sharpens it
makeup technology people probably my
all-time favorite of the entire month of
May is the brow is by NSA
yeah in ash blonde almost got
tongue-tied there after not liking
Anastasia's brow gel in blonde and just
loathing the brow pomade and blonde we
finally have a winner when it comes to
Anastasia for me because the brow is an
ash blonde is the best product for the
brows on the market ever in this world I
have never been a fan of doing my brows
with pencils because I found them to
become too waxy and it just looked off
and wrong and not right it's just the
color is amazing that the product is
amazing it is so freaking tiny that you
can just draw in hairs you can draw in
hairs with this I have never loved a
brow product as much as I'm loving the
brow is by Anastasia we got a winner so
that was a product wise for the month of
May and I have one more favor for you
I'm actually turning on my phone now
because I have a song which I'm
obsessing over
it's Royce cop röyksopp and Robin and
Robin is from undress dancing um oh yeah
um that Robin she came out with a new
song featuring Roy 'very breaks up and
it's called do it again and holy shizzle
my nizzle was it was old oh my god I
love this song
listen
whoever said for the love for the month
of May let's go on to my oh god knows
oh yeah no so as usual I only have one
oh god no for the month of the month I'm
talking about which is May this is the
Smashbox be legendary lip gloss in black
tide and I got this color and it's black
it's glittery and in some white it has
pink orange green blue red tiny mini
sort of glitter spots and in it injected
in it and I was like this is gonna be my
black glossy glittering disco heaven

Smashbox I didn't know that
