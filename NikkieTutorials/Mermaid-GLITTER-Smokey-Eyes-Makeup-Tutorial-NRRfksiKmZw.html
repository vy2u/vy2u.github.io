on this outrageous look right here I
really wanted to do a smokey mermaid
kind of that like a modern-day smokey
mermaid kind of look and this is what I
came up with and I used my beloved my
baby I used my power of makeup eyeshadow
palette plus some other really cool
products and I just wanted to give you a
reminder that this is now available at
Sephora and Ulta and to face.com sash
Nicki and you can still get your hands
on it and so today I wanted to create a
look with it to show you how to use it
for like a mermaid smokey eye type of
deal I am really really enjoying this
look and if you want to know how to get
this right here then please keep on
watching I figure today will be the
perfect day to wear a turd bun alright
so the first part is gonna go in with is
by Girl ma girl and girl girl on and
this is the gold primer I've been
absolutely obsessed with this I haven't
been able to put it down whenever I do
my makeup it just it is crazy but it
literally transforms your face into a
lifted dream I just feel like makeup
goes on so beautifully when I apply this
as a primer and just my face radiates
and it like it just it it's amazing now
for an extra kick of moisture I'm gonna
go in with the tatcha luminous dewy skin
mist I would say silk mist but it's skin
for a foundation today my absolute
favorite combo this entire month has
been to phase Born This Way in the color
pearl and then mixing it with the Oprah
absolute cover foundation in point five
and together this is like what dreams
are made of and with my morphe beauty
sponge I'm just going to Pat and dab
onto my face
I just love this plunge so much it has
the ability to make the foundation go on
so naturally and soft and light but it
also has the ability to build it up in
such a beautiful natural manner I swear
to God ever since I kind of switched
over to this sponge only as opposed to
the original Beauty Blender my face has
looked so much more natural because it
just transforms it into a face tuned
dream for concealer another all-time
favorite shape tape by Tarte yes honey
cake it on and then same sponge run then
I blend that into the skin
then same sponge NARS soft velvet loose
powder and snow and baking the under eye
area alright and now with my morphe M
444 and my giorgio armani luminous still
powder I'm just going to set the rest of
this space the first pockets are going
to go in with as always is my Mac soft
ochre Paint Pot and priming my eyes from
lash line to brow bone as a transition
color going to be taking the power of
makeup eyeshadow palette and going in
with I will always love you blush and
painkiller eyeshadow and with a soft
blending brush I'm going to define my
crease just a tiny bit and then also
this is going to be perfect as a
transition shade and get that perfect
blend now I'm going to go in with the
black milk gelato which is a gel
eyeliner by Beauty bakery and I'm going
to use this as a base on my lid on the
center of the lid and I'm gonna apply
mystic hour and I'm putting mystic hour
over top of a black base because I want
it to be a little bit more mysterious
and smoky and on the inner and outer
corners I'm applying wham-bam
and if you haven't tried win them over
top of the black base yet I highly
suggest you doing it because will make
it pop like crazy
now with a Cosette s one-eight-five
brush I'm going to slightly diffuse the
edges
and then going back in with mystic hour
and just three intensifying and also
blending the edges right here we get all
very cohesive and mummy for my lower
lash line I'm going to smoke out using
makeup and chill and applying the
chocolate Soleil bronzer on the inner
corner of the lower lash line and I'm
going to blind my inner corners using
the Catrice glam fusion eyeshadow and
wait for it wait for it
John snows favorite and then now the fun
part we've all been waiting for
I'm going to go in with my glitter and
today I'll be using the Mac transparent
teal reflex make it stick for some lit
clearly liquid glitter base just a very
very thin layer and then let's get crazy
oh I want to fill a bathtub with the
stuff and dunk my body in it right now
to seal the deal I'm going to apply some
falsies and today I'll be using my
trusty Lily lashes in NYC
all right we got these smokey mermaids
swimming on our eyeballs but now it's
time to snatch the face so first things
first I'm going to contour my cheekbones
because we're in need of some snatch
eNOS right now I'm gonna give you a pot
twist today I'm not gonna contour using
my morphe at 5:30 this is my baby this
is my everything but sometimes you got
to change it up a little bit today I'm
gonna go in with this new Sigma powder
sweep fo6 brush now I think this is
meant to brush away baking or whatever
you want with it but I think this is
insane to contour with like insane and
of course as always I'm gonna contour
using my kavanah Quan medium sculpting
powder so I'm gonna pick up some on the
brush and tap tap and I don't know how
this brush does it but it has enough
sturdiness and like denseness to it that
it can really really like really
accurately snatch that contour for you
but then it also has this like
flimsiness and softness to it to just
effortlessly blend and define it's it's
insane this brush has been doing it for
me lately it's all I contour with Bailey
it is like now I do still go in with my
m4 for for buy more feet with my face
powder and clean up underneath around it
and at the base same old same old I will
always do this
to make sure that my contour looks
flawless now I feel like we need a
little bit of bronzer on our face today
so I'm gonna go in with the chocolate
Soleil bronzer from the power of makeup
palette and a first just going to warm
up my hairline very slightly because if
I do this too much I look muddy and
disgusting and then also just right at
the contour to warm it up and diffuse it
out and give yourself that tan and then
very quickly without paying too much
attention to it I'm going to contour my
nose just a tiny bit using light
sculpting powder by Kevin Kwan
just quick and easy just like that I'm
gonna go in with a lady slipper or a
powder which looks like this and my
morphe M 509 brush I'm just going to
pick up a tiny bit and really softly I'm
going to add a tiny teeny bit of color
just very minimal she said as she
applied 10 pounds of blush lived an M
for highlighter I'm going to use a new
favorite this is citrine powder
highlighter buys you a now citrine sold
out like in a day but I will tell you
that the darker one topaz is almost the
same the only difference is that with
topaz the base is just a tad bit warmer
but citrine is the one that stole my
hearts I'm going to use that today and
I'm going to blind like a mermaid and
then with this I'm also gonna highlight
my cubed bow and then with the tip of my
ring finger I'm gonna pick up a little
bit more and I'm gonna highlight the tip
of my bridge so when it was in Paris
with g'way I wanted a super beautiful
new lip but I wanted to give it like a
twist so I went in with buff lip cream
one of my all-time favorites because
it's such a beautiful nude liquid
lipstick that works is that I'm going to
be applying buff first
and now for that fun twist and to make
it so much more mermaid and like sexy
and I'm going to go in with rose quartz
highlighter by Joey this is this is
stunning as well I mean so I'm just
picking this up on a brush mmm and going
over top okay now to block this all in
place I'm going to go in with this
Boscia white charcoal mattifying makeup
setting spray and that's it that
completes this smokey mermaid smokey
eyes makeup look modern day mermaid go
