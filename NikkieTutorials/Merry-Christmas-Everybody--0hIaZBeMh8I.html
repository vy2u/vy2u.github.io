basically became every other three or
four days because the Academy has ended
this year I'm done with like teaching
for this year and oh my sort of stress
and work came out so I really had to
take my time off because I I just needed
my time to kind of restore my body so I
really want to apologize for not having
so many sort of Christmas looks for this
year I had a lot last year and I don't
really have a lot this year so I'm
really sorry for that anyways enough of
my blooding I hope you all have an
amazing fantastic night I hope you have
good food I hope you have a warm place
and I hope you have so much fun tonight
