hey guys so today I'm doing a tutorial
inspired by Mila Kunis and Jupiter
ascending and she's wearing this awesome
roses inspired look her eyes were pink
eros toned her lips were pinky Rose she
had roses going everywhere from her head
her entire dress was beautiful and
crystallized and pretty and Africa I'm
recreating the look for you today and if
you want to know how to get this rosie
mila kunis jupiter ascending makeup look
Channing Tatum is so hot then please
stay tuned alright
so let's dive right into it I'm gonna
prime and moisturize my face using the
Too Faced hangover replenishing face
primer and also I'm going to take a
little bit of the Becca shimmering skin
Perfector in pearl to give myself some
glow and you want to apply this mixture
all over your face so just find out that
I was doing my entire foundation routine
without pressing record for foundation I
used the Mac mineralized moisture in NC
15 and mixed it with the studio sculpt
in NC 15 also I applied that to my
entire face and now I'm on to concealer
for concealer I'm using my pro longwear
by Mac also an NC 15 so you only missed
a little bit okay what I'm now going to
do is take my Real Techniques sponge and
I'm going to buff my concealer in and
I'm going to set my under eye area using
the laura mercier secret brightening
powder okay I'm not going to go off
camera into my brows and one eye and
then I'll be back
all right onto eyes the first thing I'll
be doing is applying a base to my
eyelids to prevent everything from
creasing and I'm using my soft ochre
Paint Pot by Mac then I'm taking a light
eyeshadow and running this from a crease
up to my brow bone and this will help
blend the colors out nicely
the first eyeshadow I'll use comes from
the zoeva Rodeo Belle eyes shadow
palette and it's this color right here
and this is going to be my transition
shade so I'm going to apply this right
into the crease and I'm using a zoeva
227 for this and I'm also going to go
ahead and come to the inner corner of my
crease sort of baked
so the inner crease part I'm also going
to apply the transition shade right
there from the Sigma brilliant and
spellbinding eyeshadow palette I'm going
to take hiatus which is this pink color
and this is going on to the lid just
pack it on there now to define my crease
I'm going to take this melt cosmetics
eyeshadow called enigma and just on the
outer part of my eye on the outer corner
I'm going to brush this in and then go
into my crease you just want to focus it
right here just give that eye some depth
then also drag that slightly towards the
inner corner so make your eyes look a
little bit more deep set and now going
back in with my transition shade from
these away that I showed a pallet I'm
going to buff and blend that out for the
lower lash line again taking that zueva
I should have Helen and I'm taking this
color right here and this is going from
inner to outer corner and not to blend
that out and again taking my crease
color and you don't want to take this
too far down because then we will look
like a sort of sick rabbit no we just
want to diffuse the line a little tiny
bit so it makes it look a little bit
more like a haze okay not to highlight
the inner corners I'm again taking my
new obsession
apparently the cottage cheese a jumbo
eye pencil by NYX I do not know why they
call this cottage cheese and just dab
this onto the very inner corner and then
I'm going to go over with a shimmering
pink eyeshadow alright all I'm going to
do next to complete the eyes is the
pison mascara to my top lashes only and
of course falsies and the falsies I'll
be using our by r del and these are the
whispies all right onto cheeks now for
the cheeks mila word this super sculpted
cheek with her contour almost looked a
little bit rosy because everything was
rose inspired so first going to take my
Illamasqua eyeshadow in heroin and
with this I'm just going to contour or
carve out my cheeks okay then for blush
I'm going to make a mixture of Mac's
ombre blush in vintage grape I'm going
to take the grape color but then to kick
it up a notch I'm taking this nurse oh
my gosh guy UT guy Yeti
and what I'm going to do is from my
entire contour line blend it up so
starting from my contour I'm going to go
up and this will make my contour look a
little bit more pink it will rose it up
but it will also add a blush to my face
then because the shine a Milla's face
also was really soft and subdued I'm
going to keep it small with my
highlighter today I try I'm going to
take Mac soft and gentle mineralized
skinfinish and warm it up using mary lou
manizer by the balm Cindy at Cindy at
Cindy Luminizer so it still keeps the
skin very soft yet it illuminates and
glistens it just a tiny bit which will
make you look like this perfect
porcelain doll I'm going to put soft and
gentle on the bridge of my nose only for
lips I'm starting off with fashion
revival lipstick by Mac
and then on my bottom lip on the center
also I'm going to take a little
rhinestone and this was applied right to
the middle and that guy's concludes this
