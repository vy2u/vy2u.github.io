Cyrus's new video our semi new semi C um
because it has been out for quite a
while now and I filmed a tutorial like
the day after it came out but I never
really liked how I placed the colors and
it just wasn't that good
so I want the best for my viewers and my
subscribers so that's why every filmed
it um so today we're doing Miley Cyrus
um in the music video it is kind of grey
because they use video effect to make it
kind of blue tone and gray toned and
then I found this picture on the
internet where she was in that scene
with high quality pictures and her
makeup was really colourful like it had
golden at purple it had some definition
in the crease and it had a big as I
Alana and if you want to know how I did
this and please keep on watching the
picture that I found in the button bar
and um I want to thank you guys so much
for watching I love you and
I already applied my base from Michael
Todd and now it's time to put on some
and want to axe jumbo pencil in milk to
make the colors pop on your lid I'm
going to take this 239 brush by Sigma
and going to go in the color of the nail
on my Mac and then I'm going to take
that on the brush and then take white
frost my Mac and take that on top and
then this is going all over the lid
now apply the vanilla only into your
tear duct area now I'm going to take
Clarins eyeshadow in dusky Rose number
26 and this is going to go into your
crease just blend it into the crease and
blend it up and also you want to wing it
out so you're just going to take a bit
of the color and wing it out really
lightly and then go back into the crease
now I'm going to mix two colors together
I'm going to take stars and rockets by
Mac and then I'm going to take my stars
to make a pave an eyeshadow refill in
Pandora and this is Pandora I use it in
one of my Lady Gaga videos as well love
game inspire one um so I'm going to take
the same brush take some of the stars
and rockets and then to make it more
lavender and bluish and lighter I'm
going to take the Pandora so you have
that and you're going to apply it right
here and go all the way up and also
winged this out so go into the crease
then go up to the brow and then wing it
out as well and you can go under as well
so right here and wing it out
and then you can always take your finger
and blend it if it is way too much for
your preference now I'm going to take a
Louvre the next color I'm going to take
is a gold mine my Mac and again with
that same brush just wipe it off on a
towel or make sure it's a little towel
or towel you use free okay take gold
mine and grab some of that boy and apply
this to the inner corner right here and
blend it with the purpley pink color and
go up into the brow nut entirely up to
the brow just to right here now with the
217 I'm going to go back into that
Clarence color and take just one depth
of signed sealed by Mac so one dab and
this is going to deepen the crease a bit
so just with that color go into the
crease and blend it in to deepen it and
then of course win it out in on the
outer corner
but I'm not going to do is intensify
some of the color so I'm going to go
back with the vanilla and white frost
back with the gold mine back with the
pender and the star in the Rockettes and
then go back with the Clarins in the
side and sealed again so you just want
to reapply to color to make them more
vibrant and to make them pop and to
really make it one piece so be right
back do 75 by Sigma I'm going to take
vanilla and again some of the white
frost a little bit more a little bit
more white frost than we get on the lid
because this brow needs B shimmer rotc
the lower lid I'm going to take a angel'
brush like this it's really really thin
and that's really what we want because I
mean lower lid it is
um well Miley Cyrus has dark hair so her
lashes are naturally dark I'm blonde as
you can see and my lashes are blonde so
with her dark lashes it already gives a
bit of a shadow and for me I have no
shadow at all so I'm going to take some
of the Clarence and one tap of the
signed seal and I'm going to work that
right between my lashes to kind of make
that natural shadow that she has
and then for the tear ducts I'm going to
take a vanilla and a lot of Y frost to
highlight that inner corner now it's
time to line your upper lid I'm going to
use a really really really really good
brush for this that um I got at Sigma
makeup calm this is the 210 it's like an
eyeliner brush and when I want to take
my Mac black check fluid line and you're
going to make a dramatic flirty long
winged eye light first I'm going to
tightline my eyes with this bourgeois uh
waterproof eye pencil so I'm just going
to tie it aligned I always start in the
middle and work my way out and then I
like to go in
I'm going to take a little bit more
product and then from the outer point of
your lower lash line go out let's take a
part of that line back in to connect it
with the line above my lash line and
then now it's just a matter of making it
thicker
now I'm going to line my waterline with
again black track flute line distaste on
your waterline the entire freakin die
I'm going to take manic panic true love
oh true love lashes and I cut them in
half and the longer part of the lashes
is going on my outer corner of my eyes
to have my normal lashes my real lashes
just go up and then with the fake lash
it really goes out so I'm going to do
that
the lips lips lips of course start off
with the Michael taut noodle web eyes
then take max cream Sheen lipstick in
cran the nude then take max Viva Glam
gaga and put that on your top lip and
then smack them together and you can
leave it like this but I like to add a
little bit of a gloss I'm going to use
Mac's
electric fuchsia and just take a really
teeny tiny bit because Miley does have
new D's in her video and just put that
onto the bottom lip and then smack again
so that completes this Miley Cyrus can
be tamed silver feather corset steam
peacock I hope you guys liked it I hope
