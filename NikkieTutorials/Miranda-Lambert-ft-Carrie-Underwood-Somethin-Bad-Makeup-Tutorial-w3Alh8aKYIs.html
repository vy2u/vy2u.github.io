inspired by Miranda Lambert and Carrie
Underwood in the new music video
something bad I especially took my
creation to the Carrie Underwood side
because I think her look was a little
bit more on the wearable side although I
loved how edgy and rock and roll
Miranda's look was I absolutely loved
this music video and I think the ladies
look absolutely fabulous together and
just big hair and the makeup and just a
sassiness and I just love it
I've gotten quite a lot of requests for
this look and I definitely wanted to do
it because I feel like this is your
classic go-to clubbing look I think that
when you ask someone on the middle of
the street and you're like describe a
clubbing look to me I think most of the
people would describe as this look is
because it's got that really black
glittery daring and sexy feeling but
with the new lips and then the flush of
blush and just I think this is the
classic clubbing look so yeah if you
would like to know how to get this look
inspired by Miranda Lambert and Carrie
Underwood for the music video of
something bad then please stay tuned
okay guys the first thing I'm going to
do for skin is prime and moisturize and
I actually already filmed this part
because I'm doing a first impression
video on these products but the products
I applied where the good skin lapse true
hydration 24 hour gel cream and this is
a cream that is supposed to make dry
skin this amazing hydrated cushion of a
skin and I just tried this out and I
filmed it for a first impression video
and then it's going up in a couple of
days
I think weeks actually I would also
talked about in that first impression
video is this good scale lapse / 365 all
over pore reducing serum it makes the
appearance of pores smaller or disappear
but I basically wanted to try to see if
it really keeps shine on my t-zone at
bay so I applied this combination right
here to my face and I will have a full
first impression video on that
um later on throughout this month okay
so for a foundation you want to go for
that extra flawless look today because
Kari just her face was absolutely
flawless and just flow free and just
looks amazing so what it will be using
for that is my own real true match in n1
just because this gives me that perfect
coverage without going too far and I'm
just going to apply that with my make a
big foundation stippling brush okay for
a concealer to the come as a shock that
I'll be using my Mac Pro Longwear in NC
15 because it works it makes you look
flawless and then slowly offered today
and I'll be buffing that in with my f-86
by Sigma oh just look at the difference
that makes lifted and perfect okay once
that is on I'm gonna step my face using
my Chanel natural is finished powder in
20 Claire and I'm also gonna do browsed
and one eye off-camera and as always
then I will be back first thing I do to
the eyes was apply a primer to the
entire eyelid area to prevent everything
from creasing and for this I use my Mac
soft ochre Paint Pot now be going into
the sauce box aid to palette and I'm
taking this color right here and I'm
placing the shade on the outer half of
my crease and then blending out you
don't want to go to the inner corner you
just want to keep it here on the outer
part blending out you then also want to
take a smaller precise brush and run it
along the lower lashes now I'm going to
take a Chanel steelo I shadow in black
stream and this is a beautiful
glimmering black and I'm first going to
build this up near the lash line it's
just a shimmering beautiful black which
you want to apply to be very inner
corner you don't have to be super neat
with it just don't get it everywhere and
then I want to build it up here on that
outer part like that just like that and
then with a brush I'm going to start
buffing that in to the eye and the outer
corner and the crease just basically
diffuse this pencil okay once I got that
I want to go into this deeply dashing
pressed pigment by Mac and then I'm
going to stick deeply dashing or apply
rather onto that inner part of the lid
blending up to the crease and meeting
with that black here and this will give
a nice touch of sparkly
ringg Brown which will make it a little
bit more wearable I'm going to go into
my sauce box a tooth pellet again and
highlighting with these two shades right
here and first I'm just highlighting my
brow bone as you would do with every
look but then I'm going to take a little
bit more and focus on this very inner
corner here by highlighting it this will
open up the eyes later on but also kind
of diffuse the edge of that pressed
pigment as it can be a little bit harsh
and are taking this color from the a
tooth palette and with that I'm lightly
going to diffuse the outer crease the
black part and then work my way into the
deeply dashing pressed pigment to make
the edge here seem a little softer
okay then I'm going to take some matte
black eyeshadow and run it closely to my
lower lash line and you mainly want to
keep it thin the more you go towards the
inner corner and the more you go towards
the outer corner you want to blend and
drag it down and then you wanna take it
to words that outer corner here and
connect it to the crease you definitely
want a really rounded smoky eye shape
and then I'm going to pick some of that
deeply dashing pressed pigment up with
my finger again and carefully press this
kind of all over to get that sparkle
everywhere because you could definitely
tell with both Miranda and Carrie that
they had Sparkle going everywhere so
don't be afraid to just tap this on for
my inner corner I'm highlighting with a
light reflective champagne color and
then to finish the look off I'm applying
some black kohl to my waterline and to
completely finish this eye
look off all you need is a little bit of
mascara I'm using my waterproof 3d extra
black my makeup studio every lower
lashes my neck extended play gigablack
lash and for falsies I'm gonna go with
the EXO beauty romantics so for cheeks
you want to go contoured with a pop of
pink and some glow so first gonna
contour using this Ben Nye powder Rouge
contour at number one I'm also going to
contour my forehead a little bit then
for blush I'm going to go with Mac's
mineralize blush in dainty and you
really want it on the center of your
apples of your cheeks so really smile
and pop it right here in the middle and
then for that beautiful luminous glowy
highlight I'm going to make a mixture
between my Mac's a lightscapade
mineralized skinfinish and the extra
dimension eyeshadow by Mac called
a natural flirt and I'm just popping
that on the highest points of my face
and this combination of stunning okay
for lips you want to go for a really
pale nude glossy look and I'm gonna go
with my Mac myth lipstick if they're
really gravitating towards this a lot
lately I used to do a lot when I was
around 15 16 years old then kind of
stood away from it a couple of years and
now in my 20s I'm starting to love this
color again so I'm just gonna completely
blank out my lips with this to get me
started and then because I think that is
way too pale I'm just going to do the
duck face and kind of chop it off until
I like the color and then for my class
I'm going to use Nyx's butter gloss in
fortune cookie this is the perfect match
and that guy's concludes this tutorial
