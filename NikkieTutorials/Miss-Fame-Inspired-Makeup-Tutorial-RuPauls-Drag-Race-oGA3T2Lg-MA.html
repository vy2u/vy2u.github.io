Drag Race a series today is episode
number three and my favorite this week
was miss fame the bearded challenge was
so much fun and as you could see in the
intro Clips I actually did wear a
mustache I took it off because talking
with that thing is impossible but I did
not go Jasmine masters on you I did wear
facial hair Seiya this week is miss fame
I loved her eyes I was obsessed with
these eyes right here they're so unique
yet so Dragon
I just I really really loved this look
so yeah without any further ado if you
want to know how to get this miss fame
episode number 3 makeup look then please
stay tuned I paid a backstage in
Amsterdam a visit because backstage in
Amsterdam is a store that sells a lot of
the drag queen makeup so they have
Kryolan they have Ben Nye derma color
they have wigs they have everything a
drag queen or drag queen makeup lovers
could wish for so I went to backstage in
Amsterdam to find myself the Holy Grail
TV Payne 6 because almost every drag
queen that I follow uses the TV Payne 6
as their base so I thought why not get
three colors for myself so I bought
three colors a highlight contour and
normal shade and that is what I'll be
using for my face today so first up is
my base color and this is g19 one and I
just apply them the same way as I would
apply my Bobbi Brown foundation stick
and I'm just buffing this all in with a
brush yes I know it's very yellow but I
will correct that with highlighter later
on okay once that is on and we look
SuperDuper yellow we're going to correct
this with contouring and highlighting
for contouring I have the TV paint stick
in SS 3-1 so let's just do this
let's get really beige rainbow wheat for
today this is actually a really great
contouring shade and let's now highlight
with 406
look at that isn't that fun okay I'm
quickly going to set my under eye area
and then move on to contouring my nose
and we have our nose done so I'm not
just going to powder my face and move on
to brows and one eye off-camera and then
we'll be back for the eye portion all
right the first thing I'm doing is
always is applying a base and this is my
soft ochre Paint Pot by Mac now I'm
taking an Illamasqua eye pencil in
interrogate and with this I'm going to
sketch out where what my new crease to
be and we're not going as high up as we
do with violet and pearl and then
quickly softening that in and blending
it out just quickly nothing too perfect
now I will intensify that with a little
bit of matte brown eyeshadow and just
define this and blend it out and make it
more prominent just work that new crease
in and then just with a bigger blending
brush
keep blending that out and softening it
up now we're going to put down the base
of our eyeliner so I'm going to take my
Kat Von D tattoo liner in trooper and I
will just create my base with this then
on the lid I'm now applying on a size a
Beverly Hills bone just onto the lid
meeting up to that new crease yes it's
totally fine if you cover up that
eyeliner because we will going over top
with a different one later on now for
today's flitter I'll be using Mac's
reflex in Pearl and my base today is
Mac's eyeliner mixing medium
and then now with my NYC black liquid
liner I'll be continuing working on my
eyeliner all right now that we've got
this it's time to work on that little
pointy thingy she had in her crease so
I'm just going to create a little
triangle shape and now with black eye
shadow I'm going to intensify that
crease line that we created earlier on
and then with a dark-brown I'm going to
blend that out slightly
and then quickly at the base of that
little triangle I'm placing a white dot
for the lower lash line a first starting
off by again drawing a new inner corner
and then with a black eye shadow you're
going even further underneath but
letting a little space open to apply
some white in to because that will open
up the eyes again and then just follow
your lash line and then once you reach
that outer point you're going to drag it
out straight out just drag it out
straight straight outwards and then
right underneath that point you drag it
down towards the lower lash line and
that is where you want to apply a little
black dot and then with illamasqua
precision inked in scribe I'm just going
to fill in the blank spots and to open
up the eyes even more I'm applying jumbo
pencil in milk by NYX in my waterline
all I'm going to do now is apply false
lashes and mascara and then it will be
back all right let's go on to the cheeks
I already contoured with the cream
before and I think that looks fine so
I'm not going to read enhance any
contouring or whatsoever so I'm just
going to go over to bronzer now the
bronze I'll be using today is refined
golden by Mac and I'll be using this to
slightly warm up my face just really
lightly right on that contour line for
blush I'm using the colour-pop super
shock cheek in bonus this is going right
on the apple of the cheek and you know
it for highlighter moonstone by Becca
ephra lips today I'll first be using
coloured raine lipstick in vanity rain
which is a true red true blue tone red
then on the center of the lip to give it
a more orange II feel because Miss fames
lips were quite on the orangie side of
red I'm taking another coloured raine
liquid lipstick this is Electra green so
we've got vanity rain and electric rain
and then as a gloss I'll be using the
Chanel glossa Marin 188
okay this I like and now going over top
with the gloss all right so really
quickly to finish this look off all we
need is two little hearts red light
reflective hearts and those are going
right here and right here and just apply
them right there and then you're done
slap a wig on and that's it
