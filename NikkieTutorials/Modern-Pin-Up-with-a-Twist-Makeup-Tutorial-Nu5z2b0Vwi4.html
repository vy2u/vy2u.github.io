tutorial on a sort of inspired modern
pin-up look before I went to Tenerife I
made this face chart because I was
inspired by like pinup things so we have
this really like perfect eyes with red
eyeliner to kind of make it more modern
and then these super matte lips that I
kind of overdrawn a bit because I'm
watching RuPaul's Drag Race and I'm sort
of obsessing over the drawn on lips so
I've drawn over the lip line the Raven
and Jujubee
ah see ya today I decided to do a modern
sort of pinup inspired look and oh by
the way I had this new blouse this new
shirt thingy from ASOS and it's a bruh
kun Laos and I'm absolutely loving it
it's so cute like this is Edie this is
Fred this is Kermit I know you so think
you guys know it's not the arthro say if
you want to know how I got this modern
pin-up inspired look then please keep on
watching
so as always the first thing you want to
do is to apply a baster I list to
prevent the eyeshadow from creasing and
the one I'm using is my stuffed ochre
Paint Pot by Mac the first time I said
is we'll be using our by makeup geek and
this is purely naked and this is a latte
and with those two colors I am going to
define my crease quite a bit but the
crease only for now and what I want to
go for with this look is quite a bit of
definition here on the inner part so go
ahead and just blend those two colors
from makeup geek in and especially on
the inner corner right here because that
is something that I really like with
purely naked only I am going to blend
the edges a bit more to make it a little
bit more soft as a highlight I will be
using next chamomile and I broke it in
my suitcase at entry with that you're
highlighting your brow bone and also
blending down the crease colors and make
them they'll look perfectly blended not
 girl then after the highlight I
always like to go back with the crease
color a bit more and re blend that and
blend that in and make it look perfect
everything to get the perfect crease
like that hunty stop it you're getting
enough for my eyes I'm using chemical by
Mac again and mixing it a little bit
with makeup geeks vanilla bean and
that's going all over the lid not just a
center or the inner part everything
again just a teeny tiny bit of mixed
Swiss chocolate blending bed along my
crease as well to warm it up a bit just
really really lightly you're almost not
touching your skin with a brush for the
bottom line I'm gonna take Swiss
chocolate again and sort of make a line
underneath my eye and leave a little gap
open between the lashes and that line
that you're making and this will give
the illusion of the summer bigger eye
and I got this from Lisa Eldridge
I love that trick making online keeping
a little bit of distance between the
real lash line and stopping right there
and then blend it out and make it look
pretty
taking a somewhat fluffier brush and
blend it out even more you don't want it
to be a line at the end you really want
it to be a new faded lash line I'm going
to highlight the inner corners with my
highlighting colors that I used on my
brows as well also run it a bit along
that gap that you created onto the red
eye liner I actually started off with a
lip liner to kind of map out how I
wanted my shape to be the one I'm using
is brick lip pencil by Mac and it's sort
of a darker red color blended it on the
inner corners of my eyes and make that
opaque then for my makeup studio
eighteen color eye shadow palette I
actually took that red right there and
mix it a bit with this one and then I
started blending the inner part out
don't ask me why I don't think it has
any special like effect in the end a dis
really liked like blending red eyeliner
on my I done judged and once I had that
liner I went into a liquid eyeliner and
this one is by Makeup Forever and this
is the number ten aqua liner and I will
my wing to be quite they're quite
extreme from the point go back in and
meet up
you
so for a nice modern twist on the lips I
am actually going to use these lip stain
markers the ones I will be using are by
gosh and this is the long-lasting lip
marker in number three Barry and the NYC
smooch proof lip stain in rock on Ruby
first to kind of map out the lip shape
that I want I am going to use brick lip
pencil by Mac again just to kind of
match the colors a bit so first I'm
going to line fill in with brick and
then go on top with the smudge proof and
the lip stains I've been watching a lot
of RuPaul's Drag Race so sorry if my
lips look a little bit more overdrawn
than usual but I'm so inspired by all
those big mouth
okay so I decided to do my lips before
the cheeks because um often with red
lips your face completely changes your
color changes your entire expression
changes so that is why I wanted to do
cheeks after lips
I already did contour my face prior to
filming with my NYX taupe blush and a
little bit of warm with the powder
blusher in fidelity I think by
Illamasqua the name fade it off but it
looks like that and I'm actually going
to use that a little bit more to warm up
my face a little bit more because I look
really really pale with red lips I'm
just warming up my face a bit with the
Illamasqua blush and I believe vitality
but if it's different I will put it on
my blog or blush I wanted to go really
pink and really girly just on the apples
of the cheeks and for that I will be
using Mac's
Sakura just a little bit and then Azalea
blossom as well mix it together I'm
basically going to take everything off
on the back of my hand and then smile
and put it on my apples I am going to
use a glowy highlighter on the high
points of my face and for that I'm using
Suburban AK that's just for an amazing
shine and that completes my modern
pin-up look inspired tutorial I love
this eye I think the red eyeliner gives
it a fun twist and then just the lips I
am a sucker for big drawn on lips
especially after RuPaul's Drag Race like
Raven and all the other drag queens with
our drama lips I'm like a Amy thought so
