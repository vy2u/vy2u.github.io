keeping me company today and you know
this is Joyce you could see her in our
Yankee Candle Hall which was a may fall
so today I invited Joyce to Temple
tutorials once again I decided to let
her you know do her thing on my face
she's going to talk you through this
entire tutorial so there will not be
anything of me just other than just
sitting here so yeah without any further
ado if you want to know how to get this
roaring 20s Dior inspired look all made
up by Joyce then please keep watching
Hey hope you guys like it I'm gonna do
Nicky's foundation this is what I always
do on shoots I'm just gonna Nestle
messily put it on her and then right
right I'm gonna blend it with my Beauty
Blender dots I'm just gonna dab it in
her skin only do foundation because I'm
gonna do heavily makeup and I always do
the foundation first and then after when
I'm done with the eyes I'm gonna do
concealer and see where it needs to be
more hey gal I'm gonna get my trial and
supra color and I'm gonna make her
eyebrows usually she does pretty I
breath but I'm gonna make him disappear
see now it's lighter hmm
so Joyce just its skin and brows and we
already went ahead and did the first I'm
so first I'm gonna use the black from
the va's art palette my baby
and I'm gonna blend it out towards the
outer eye corner I started down because
then I have the right line I want to
to blend it a little it's going to look
messy now what I'm going to blend
everything because I love blenders and I
just follow her eye and just blend it
out a little don't worry if you like get
it all messy face and body from that is
the perfect you rates are now I'm going
to take my fluffy and I'm going to start
here you can push and then I'm going to
use circular motion I'm going to use a
flat brush to make it more black push it
and more Shergar pal I'm gonna use the
purple Oh there no zip off this one I'm
just gonna add some purple here also
with a fluffy cuz I do not like hard
lines now I'm gonna use the Olga and
just gonna put it underneath the black
and blend it out a little bit would you
love it when your model don't know where
to look and make when you say look up
you're like you're all I hate it when
they look right in my face stop it
Patricia's gonna apply a illamasqua
liquid metal in whatever this says I'm
gonna use my fingers to tap it where you
want my finger is on the button and then
I'm gonna use illamasqua another liquid
metal this is color resolute I'm going
to put a little bit where the purple is
use my purple fluffy to blend it out and
now I'm going to use the LMS liquid
metal and stoic I'm just going to apply
it
getting here
now we're taking the illamasqua pigment
in or just stop now I'm going to use a
black liner the model can bling because
if she doesn't blink you'll get teary
eye and then you're already eyes
are done and now we're going to go to
concealer and cheeks and I'm going to
use my Bobbi Brown artist palette and
I'm going to use the foundation as
concealer because it's already a little
bit thick and it looks better on
pictures so I always do the Kevin aqua
and it's like a V from the mouth to the
eye the outer eye I always use the Bobbi
Brown palette to cover up because the
concealer from the Bobbi Brown is
sometimes a little bit too fake mm-hmm
so for like natural looks when you're
doing like a nude makeup or whatever I
use the foundation and then I take my
Beauty Blender and just blend it in the
skin now I'm gonna use the powder are
you there then I'm gonna use Chanel who
do look at me Zack said Adele Ebola I'm
good okay so now it's time for cheeks
yes cheeks a little bit of contouring so
I just like put it in there and now I am
gonna do blush my al and just go unlike
word the Apple I'm just like sorry
and just like blended in okay so now
what Joyce is going to do is do some
highlighting and if someone on planet
earth knows how to highlight its miss
Joyce right here
so of course you may know that my
highlighting secret is vanilla so I'm
gonna put it underneath on her what does
that not cheekbone the highest points of
your cheekbone yes I'm just gonna London
to highlight the nose I go in a little
what is that the dent and the little in
a little here like that so the little
and I put it on the Cupid's bow yeah
keep it slow all righty so down is the
shimmer my look for today is inspired by
Galliano so I'm gonna do a gully on my
lip
it's gonna be a little artsy fartsy lip
I'm going to use the purple this is the
old Inglot but I don't know which color
start with the cupid
