has it has crashed upon us I thought it
would be fun to kind of tell you guys
about my 2013 resolutions and my plans
for 2013 and what I want to sort of
accomplish and what my goals are and yes
okay so I'm doing this out of my head
and I normally I write things down to
don't forget to stay in videos didn't do
it this time I just want this to come
from within that goes without said of
frizz goal for 2013 is to be healthy of
course and I really want to lose weight
and I'm actually been losing weight for
about two weeks now and it's been going
great I've been doing this thing called
Herbalife where you have this like shake
thing and you eat it instead of bread
and all that stuff so I do have my
dinner and I just eat anything for
dinner but like breakfast and lunch is
with a shake from Herbalife and so far
if you're really liking it I'm like I'm
like a bread obsessed freak so it was
kind of hard for me to let bread go
don't let go Jack so that was kind of
hard for me the first few days but right
now I'm really used to it and I can feel
that my tummy is getting a lot like I
can feel myself just becoming healthier
and skinnier and that is what I really
wanted for a long time I don't want to
get like this but I do really want to
shrink down a bit because you guys
always tell me how are you pregnant and
I'm like first of all you need a penis
for that and second of all no I'm not
lesbian I get that a lot too you like
are you a lesbian no I'm not I'm into
the boy write that down another
resolution is I did my first magazine
cover makeup and hair wise last year and
I want at least five new ones
this year I feel like
2013 has to be my year sort of work-wise
off of youtube I really I want at least
five magazine covers and then I also
really really want to do another TV show
where I do hair and makeup we had
Holland's Next Top Model two years ago
but they cancelled it last year and I
don't know what the plans are for this
year but I really want to do another TV
thing we have no youni off also I would
like to get a boyfriend
this year I've been single for for 18
years out of my 18 year life it's sad
it's a sad sad situation it's a sad sad
situation
I want more videos than just makeup
tutorials alone and I'm not trying to
say that I want to become sort of like
this whole girl that we have on YouTube
here because I need to get this off my
chest
I didn't want to tell anyone but lately
I feel like I've been putting so much
work into my videos and then I come
across this channel of this girl just
showing whatever she buys even if it's
like toilet paper and this girl had more
subscribers than me the easiest videos
to film our halls but you're just
talking and talking and talking and with
makeup tutorials you really have to show
what you're doing and your lining has to
be good and I feel like with halls it's
just the easy road and I love doing
halls I love watching the halls but when
one channel has halls only and they have
like tons and tons of subscribers so
with it I'm like why I wanted you outfit
of the days and I want to do get ready
with me videos because I've been asked
to do that quite a lot and I really
really just want to expand my genre of
video so I want to do more quick tips I
want to do more hair stuff more neill
stuff so I just want to kind of branch
out of my comfort zone and my comfort
zone is makeup tutorials because that is
what I love doing most but it's
it's so much work and I love that but
sometimes I'm like not today another
resolution of mine is to well last year
was it to get a car and to get car
another resolution of mine is to go to
America one more time I've been to New
York last year and I've been to New York
the year before that and I'm not sure if
I am going to New York again I kind of
feel like New York is my second home now
and I know what's there and I've
experienced everything well not
everything New York but I feel like
right now it's time to branch out again
so I might want to go to LA and I'm not
sure yet I I'm not gonna do any promises
but I want to go to Berlin again because
last year we filmed the Volkswagen
commercial with where I crashed but I
went to Berlin and we were there for
three days and I was there with my mom
and it was so much fun and one thing
like I've been in Berlin three days and
they have the Caddy bay and that is this
sort of huge department store and they
have Tom Ford makeup there
they had this Tom Ford eyeshadow palette
I've had it in my hands a dozen times
there and I didn't buy it and one reason
alone to go back to Berlin is to get
that palette because I can't find it
anywhere
online every time I hear someone say
Berlin I'm like something for pellet why
why did I let you go Jack so I really
want to go back to Brooklyn just for
that pellet alone and I really loved
brilliant people were so nice and I love
Berlin so I want to go to America and
Berlin and I want to go somewhere sunny
but that is like three holidays and I
think that's a little bit overboard with
expectations so it's gonna be a really
hectic sort of work-related 2013 but I'm
so ready for it and I'm so excited for
it and yeah so if you have any
resolutions and please let me know in
the comment section below or leave a
video response I would love to see that
so big
so much for watching I hope you enjoyed
hopefully I will see you guys next time
you can follow me on Twitter Facebook
and Instagram that all is maybe
tutorials and let's all have an amazing
2013 it's gonna be amazing and we're
gonna do it all together
so yeah thank you guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
