on my favorite brushes and when I use
them for I don't know why but this video
got requested so much in the last couple
of months that I decided to film it
today for view Toller so I'm basically
just going to show you every single
brush that I use a lot on myself a
models on clients basically brushes that
I use all the time and I'm also sort of
going to explain what I use them for etc
etc so let's go okay so I'm going to
start off with my face brushes I always
start my day with my foundation brush I
first put my primer on and then I go to
foundation my favorite foundation brush
is this one by sadhana lace and this is
the flat top kabuki style a lot of
companies make these but I really like
to sit on a lace one because customer
service is amazing at sadhana lace and
also this brush it just it kind of has
set more of an ick factor to it than the
other flat top kabuki brushes out there
for concealer I always use this Real
Techniques brush I believe it's called
the crease brush but I use it for
concealer um it's just the right amount
of brush hairs I only use this brush to
kind of lay down my concealer because I
always blend it out with my Beauty
Blender but it just does such a good job
at just letting it down because it's
really dense and it really packs it on
in a good way to powder my face I always
just a Real Techniques blush brush it's
just the softest brush I have ever used
in my life it just feels as if Bambi's
sort of tail got cut off and put on this
brush right here it just makes you matte
in seconds and just it's such a pleasure
to use this I love this for powder or
contouring I always use my Mac 168 this
is the slanted sort of contour brush and
it's just perfect too because it's
slanted it's perfect to get into that
line of your shape of your contour and
to really blend it out I know Sigma and
sadhana lays do these types of verses as
well but those are a little bit too
fluffy and too big and this is really
compact and really small so you can
really
contour with it to blend out my contour
and to add warmth to my face I always
use this Sigma extravaganza blush brush
in F 92 it's really really big it's
really fluffy it's really light it's
really Airy it just blends powders on
your skin like no other so that is why I
love to use it as like a fluffy brush
all over my skin to add warmth because
this is so fluffy
it won't act like a straight line like a
contour brush would so because this is
fluffy it kind of spreads the color for
blush my holy grail is by Tom Ford and
this is the number six I talked about
this so much in my videos this is
Bambi's mother's tail cut off and then
put on a rush and then my last face
brush is my highlighter brush and this
is the Haku odo s 113 and this is
perfectly shaped for highlighting it
just fits right here on the width of
your highlighting space and you can sort
of squint it down and use your nose
Cupid's bow it's the perfect brush it's
sort of fluffy but dense as well I love
the neon orange with the gold for
eyebrows I only use three brushes this
is a spoolie everyone knows what a
spoolie looks like then two back on my
brow powder I used a stargazer angled
brow brush in number seven this is
really really synthetic so it's great
for really if you pinch it together the
hairs kind of stick to each other and I
love that because when I make it really
sharp I can make the sharpest like brow
lines ever and I love this and then I
always run some concealer along my brows
to make them perfect and for that I just
use this angled brush that I got in a
Dutch drugstore here and it's just an
angle brush with again synthetic hairs
and I love it it's been with me for five
years now for eyes I got quite a few but
I really really love all of them the one
I always use for my lids for my idol
list is the Mac 239 you can really pack
on color with this I have three of these
um they are just my Holy Grail eyelid
brush they are short compact perfect
size and they just pack on color really
well but for my crease I go a little
wild brush wise because I want dense
brushes that really
color and I want really fluffy brushes
to blend it all out to really pack on
colors into my crease there are three
favorites
this one is by BH Cosmetics and I got
this in sort of like a kit a gift set
and it's the perfect size to get in your
crease and really pack on that color and
then make your statement make your line
your crease line and you can also blend
it out a little bit with this one then
this is a Mac 165 s and this I actually
got when I bought a Sega Mega shed on
eBay um this was when I first started
using makeup and I needed brushes and I
got this fake set I didn't know it was
fake for Mac this is just a perfect size
so sturdy so dense and it just packs on
color like no other so I really like
that as well for my lower lash line and
the less is a really really small brush
by essence of beauty and this is the
crease small brush this is a really
small pencil brush that really packs on
color under your eyes in your crease in
every little corner of your eye
it's amazing then to blend it all out I
have a couple of favorites as well this
is the Sigma large fluff in E 50 this is
perfect for when I go do makeup on
models because I always work with the
nose line all models and this just kind
of blends it out so well then of course
in my 217 is one of my all-time
favorites is just it blends out like a
dream and the stigma ones are exactly
the same the Mac ones are exactly the
same so it doesn't really matter what
you use and then I love the Mac 224
because it's it's big its fluffy but
still precise so it may look as if you
couldn't do with it but literally
you just put your brush in your crease
do windshield wiper motions and it's
blended out but in a really nice natural
way I love this brush I have three of
them as well I love it to highlight my
brow bone and just clean up other areas
this is my Mac 252 gray for my brow bone
it just fits right there and I can
really make things sharp with this inner
corners everything for the inner corners
of my eyes I used 2 Sigma performance a
smudge brush and e 21 perfect size for
inner corners it just fit
it's perfectly look at that it just fits
perfectly on the inner corner and when
you look up just brush it there look
down brush it there perfect size for
inner corners there for eyeliner I get
this asked a lot I like to go to the
pointed eyeliner brushes that are really
really small in detailed I always used
to use this white nail art brush I
always got questions like where did you
get it I got it at an eel supply store
and this was like 2 euros and it's just
a nail art brush but actually yesterday
I found out about this design Pro number
twenty two brush it's it's like heaven
on earth it is so small detailed but
long enough to kind of make your perfect
wing and go back in and fill everything
up I did my eyeliner with it today for
an Iggy Azalea a tutorial that I
actually put on like two days ago it's
absolutely amazing so if I could
recommend one eyeliner brush it's the
v-sign Pro number twenty-two and then
last but not least are my lip brushes
this is the Mac 231 this is the perfect
shaped a lip brush um it's small it's
dense it's compact and it just puts on
your lip color in seconds and then to
conceal the edges I always use my makeup
studio s18 um you can use this for lips
as well but I just really like it for
concealing around the edges there are
all my favorite brushes that I like to
use on a daily basis I hope I kind of
helped you out with this with what you
can try out for your own personal price
and face lips so yeah I guess I hope
