it's this my new way of starting videos
by saying I'm here to bring you my today
I'm here to read so today I thought it
was fun to share with you my favorite
filter apps on my iPhone for Instagram
and such because when I Instagram stuff
I always get the question what filter
did you use and what F did you use and
what the hell that you use woman one of
my most favorite things to do in my day
is editing photos on my iPhone I love
doing that anyway today I'm here to
share with you my favorite filter apps
that I use with my iPhone for Instagram
pictures or whatever and let's go so
this is my phone and um I actually
showed this in a couple of videos and I
got some questions where I got the case
from and I got this from a sort of big
store in the Netherlands called maybe
I'm marked and but the case itself is by
case-mate and Bob that's it they had a
panda they had a monkey they had a um I
believe they had a crocodile they
probably have lots of stuff but I love
monkeys
so I got the monkey one with the banana
on the side okay so let's go to the
filters so my favourite app by far is
KITT Kim and I talked about this in a
favorites video as well and kid chem is
just it's amazing you can take pictures
with it you can add so many amazing
filters to it but it's just it's really
nice to click Edit and then you can do
auto at hands and you can do so many
stuffs I use it to sharpen my pictures I
use it to color balance my pictures I
use it to bring more light into my
pictures I changed my contrast with kick
em I change possibly anything with kick
cam I put a border around my pictures
with kick him I love give Kim another
epidural ike is uh and I got this French
on post a date here on YouTube and it's
called more beauty to what this is is
and don't tell everybody I'm probably
telling everybody now but it's an app to
retouch your skin don't judge I have
those days where I'm like super duper
proud of my my
so today or like I look really good but
I have this huge zit on my face and I'm
like I don't want that on my picture I
don't want that say to be remembered
throughout the entire interwebs so no so
with more beauty - you can sort of make
your skin look really soft and smooth I
don't do this with all of my pictures I
basically do it whenever my skin looks
like crap so don't think that all of my
pictures have this filter on top of it I
use this at way more often than I should
because sometimes I just look like a
plastic doll and people are like you
have great skin and I'm like yes but the
filter is healthy choose your picture
and then it's loading and then you can
sort of adjust the brightness you can
adjust the smoothing and the smoothing
sort of part of the app makes your skin
look smooth and then you can make that
less or more there okay then I have
photo for J - I used to use that a lot
but then I got kick him and kick him
kind of took over
so photo forge 2 is basically like
Photoshop on your phone you can do
everything with it except for retouching
your skin then I have pic effects you
can add a lots and lots of great filters
with this you can add like the bow cast
stuff like the bubbles around you and
the lights so pic effects these are
really nice here you see you said a lot
as well but it kind of got replaced by
other apps as well but it's a great
starter to start with that's why it's a
starter then we got over and over is
great because you can add text to your
pictures with / then I got lights pic
and with my pic I kind of do the bokeh
and the sort of light things around my
face when I have those on my pictures
and then my pic just asks you to choose
what kind of light you want on it so if
you want hearts you can add hearts to it
and like bubbles and get all types of
lights to it it's awesome now my second
favorite app is reapeaks
and my boyfriend discovered this and I
love re pics with remix you can add
stars around you if I take a picture and
you click stars you can just add stars
all over your picture
and you have like teeny tiny sparkles
all around you can add glow smoke you
can get flares
you can add dust scratches stains like
there's a little like brush in there
called legacy you can lighten your eyes
with that so when you see like little
stars around me on my Instagram pictures
that's wrong read pics you can just
click stars and you just put them like
that and then you have stars all around
you I love that a deluxe FX I don't
really like that I don't know why that
still on my phone we got lumi lumi is
basically the same to light pick um if i
had to choose one of the two I would go
for a light pick because it has more fun
light picks then we got tilt shift Jen
this is great for if you have photos of
outside and you can really blur things
out a you can make things look more more
alive basically I used tilt shift Jen a
lot when I make pictures from outside
Fisk ochem um I got this because of
Carly Chrisman but I don't really use it
a lot it has some fun things um what I
love to do with vsco cam is at Green
when I want to be really artsy fartsy at
grains my pictures I have a wider graham
wider grab is a good one sometimes an
Instagram you want to post something and
it doesn't fit or it crops too much off
would you do with y de Grimm white a
Grimm you add a photo and it just puts
it in the the picture without cutting
anything off so normally with Instagram
it sort of crops it and you like lubos a
lot of the picture but was wider graham
you have the entire picture and then you
can choose a background colors then the
last step i have for you is pick frame
and with pic frame and you guys are
gonna love this one
with pic frame you can add multiple
pictures in one square so sometimes I
got Christmas like how do you get two
photos in one Instagram post pic frame
you can do one side by side underneath
each other you can do for you can do
whatever you can do so many things and
you have so many options to choose from
so you can make like mini collages so if
I have to suggest five of these to start
off with the first would be kit cam then
I would go for
pick frame then I would go for more
beauty - I would go for reapeaks and I
would go for over to add text but if
you're not a text lever on top of your
pictures go for light pick so those were
