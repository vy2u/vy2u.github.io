that I normally would um this is the
first time ever I'm gonna show you
something of my collection um the most
requested stuff I ever get is probably
number one is my makeup collection
number two my face routine and number
three my jewelry collection I personally
think there's a really fine line between
showing what your collection is all
about or bragging and the number one
reason I will not do a makeup collection
video is because I just know that I'm
gonna get commas that I'm bragging while
I'm not but today I will show you my
jewelry collection I got tons and tons
of questions when I'm wearing a new ring
and you're all like oh where did you get
