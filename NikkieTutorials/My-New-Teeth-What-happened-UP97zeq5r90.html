hey guys so um two weeks ago um I posted
a new video and it was the Kathryn at
the masquerade ball from The Vampire
Diaries look and um as soon as I posted
it my first comment probably was o-m-g
your teeth are different what did you do
and all of you were completely right I
changed my teeth in the well I didn't do
it but you know so let's do a little bit
of history my teeth always were like
help as soon as I was seven years old I
had to like um get my uh I translation
no he's in like tooth I need to find out
what keys in is in English Griner diaper
no what was the other word molar molar
haha when I was six those back back back
molars were completely like hell they I
don't know what I did was a kid but they
were rotting um that was one big horror
story because of course you want your
mother with you when they're going to
inject like this big thing in your mouth
and they're gonna remove your teeth and
you're gonna be like ah I always was so
scared of dentists that I wanted my mom
with me you know and as soon as he was
like scratching my first molar molar I
started freaking out because I was so
freaking scared and then you know what
he said you said to my mother well miss
go sit down there you motherfucker
he told my mom to go sit in the back of
the room I was six years old mother
fudge so I needed that I started
freaking out even more because hello you
don't take a mother away from her child
when the child is in panic as
said I started freaking out even more
and you know what he did then he sent my
mom to the waiting room you know I was
six at that time but now that I think of
it what an asshole since then I was
scared as all dentists and then we moved
to a different city and a new dentist
and luckily enough this is the best
dentist it's a girl dentist Asst ever I
always had a gap between my teeth and I
hated it
I always felt like Miss Piggy with it I
don't know if she had a gap between her
teeth I had like this gap and then
really tiny teeth um right here and then
that and that it was horror also I
always had like little spots on my teeth
like white like little smudges on my
teeth and it looked so stupid
so around three years ago I went to my
new dentist and she told me well I can
see you have like this weird little
spots on your teeth and if you want I
can put like a little layer on top of it
with we make the color we mix it and
match it to your own color
and we can put this layer on your tooth
and then we'll make the entire tooth
like one color without smudges so when
she said that a whole world open to me
because I was so happy with it
and two months ago I bleached my teeth
and I did that because my teeth always
were yellow and I could never wear pink
lipstick because it will make them even
more yellow like feel ugly and Gaga I
bought it loved it but I could never
wear it because my teeth looked yellow
with it so I decided to bleach my teeth
and no I didn't do because of the haters
haters can kiss my ass and lick it if
they want I've been like whining about
it for like forever and then I finally
did it
but because there were two layers on my
front teeth um they didn't color because
my dentist made the color herself and
they don't whiten if you know what I
mean
all my T's were nice and pearly white
except for these two and they look so
like well you have nice white teeth
except for the front too
so I went back to my dentist and I sold
our well girl we need a new layer on my
teeth because they because I bleached
them and um you made the color like two
years ago and now I need a new color
because that myalgia tees are wider now
and then she came really honest with me
she said well I'm gonna be honest do you
like that gap between your teeth I was
like why are you asking now you know the
answer and if I have to be like
completely honest your siteís are a
little bit like baby teeth they never
really grew and I was like yes that's so
true and I was like hoping she was going
to say something to fix it you know what
we can do we can make those layers and
make those layers bigger than your own
teeth and we can make them like straight
and we can fix the gaps and we can fix
like the baby teeth and all I did while
she said that was this the procedure was
around 45 minutes and um I got so many
questions - it hurt or anything and to
be honest it didn't hurt at all um
actually was kind of relaxing and after
like 30 minutes I almost fell asleep and
she told me and I was like doing this
she put eliminated veneers on my teeth
and um I don't know why they are
laminated or why they call them
laminated but I only asked I know that
people on YouTube want to know what this
is how are they call and she said well
tell them it's called laminated veneers
I feel so happy with them I can finally
smile without thinking damn I look like
Miss Piggy right now you guys have no
idea how self-conscious I always was
about my teeth um I hated them and for
her to fix them to me admit so much to
me like I can finally smile without
thinking I look like a freak
clown right now you know so I'm really
happy that you get that really happy
because I finally smile I know how
self-conscious you can be if our teeth I
know everything about it and I know
people loved my gap but it really made
me insecure and I don't want things to
make me insecure so I'm going to fix
them so if you want to know what I
officially got I got my teeth bleached
at UM the white small company in text
and um that was 150 dollars so if you're
interested in like getting your teeth
bleached only you like your life how to
sit there but you just want them wider
go to the white smile company in Utrecht
um in Tilburg and know - that was such
sorry so I asked him if we could do
something for my viewers and you said
well if you make an appointment to
bleach your teeth
um till the end of January I will give
them 20 euros discount so instead of 150
euros it's 130 um I know I'm really late
with posting this video and that's
because I had to wait for my dentist to
fix everything again so I'm going to
call him and ask him if he can extend it
to me because I was really late and I'm
so sorry and my dentist
ah fix my teeth by putting on those
eliminated veneers so um I can tell you
my dentist but I guess that if you live
in like Rotterdam or South Dakota you're
not coming to my village in the
Netherlands to get my to get your teeth
done by my dentist I don't think you
will so if you want to get like a gab
done ask your dentist for a laminated
veneers or veneers I don't know people
tell me how pretty airs also you
probably want to know how many um euros
the teeth cost me I got four veneer so
I've got one here here
here and here and I saved up for this
because it was so important to me and
the price was not kidding
the price for my new smile was around
five hundred dollars so uh one hundred
and fifty euros to bleach them and 350
euros to uh get them fixed get the
veneers you guys make my will like you
really do so again thank you guys so
much for watching and thank you for like
um giving all this to me comments on my
new teeth I'm so happy with it and also
for the people will like my gap they
told me well I loved your gap between
your teeth but now that you're happy
with it I'm happy for you and you have
no idea how much it means to me I'm so
thankful for all of you I love you I
really do
and um I can't wait you rock and Rumble
on YouTube I love you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
