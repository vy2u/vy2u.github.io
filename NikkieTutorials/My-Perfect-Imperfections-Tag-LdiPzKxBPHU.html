going to do the perfect imperfections
tag um no one was sweet enough to just
tag me by my name so um I felt left out
and no one asked me to do it itself
today I'm just gonna do by myself and no
one even asked me - in case you're
wondering if you're like am I really
seeing this on my screen am I really
seeing a lady gaga hairdo on my screen
yes you're seeing it right I'm not
wearing any makeup because um I'm
actually sick I have the worst cool ever
fever now and then and every time I wake
up I feels like I have a throat
infection because I almost can't swallow
and stuff so instead of people looking
at my makeup I want em to look at my
hair um if you look at the background
I'm wearing my new um so if you look at
the background I'm wearing my new urban
original heels I wish I was like really
good with my feet and cannot twist them
but not no it's not gonna work so
wearing my new heels and I did a blog
post on them on my website so um
clicking the link below if you want to
see that because it really rocks yeah
okay so um I'm in my bed right now and
we're going to do the my perfect
imperfections tag so you have to tell
you for you is like three things that
you don't like about yourself but
probably no one ever noticed it about
you and you have to do three perfect
things that you like about yourself so
yesterday when I felt even more like
crap
I wrote down uh six things in total like
the imperfect things and the perfect
things and um yeah I'm gonna tell you
guys I'm gonna start off with the
imperfect stuff because I like that
stuff better imperfect thing number one
my lips um
as some of you might know I have a
really really red lips and I hate it
like other people they swear to God that
it's so pretty and I'm so lucky that I
have red pigmented lips from my own no I
hate it okay I hate it I hate pigmented
lips on myself just because one it draws
all the attention to the lips and when I
have done so much work on my eyes it's
like don't look at this look at this
that's where I spend all my hours on
imperfect thing number two I hate my
height I'm six to six foot two oh six
feet to six foot feet in meters that is
one meter and 90 centimeters people
always think I'm this short little tiny
girl that screams that does stupid stuff
in life I'm like if you think of a model
height which is around it um 180 meters
I don't know how many feet that is um
you're like that's a really nice length
F she must be so happy with it they see
me walking murdered they're like oh she
must really hate her high because she's
so tall I'm really tall it's like really
awkwardly tall because I'm always always
the tallest one in a group I'm never
lucky with the boys whenever we go out
everyone stares at me they like
seriously they stare at me like is it
cold up there so I really hated that you
could only do three imperfect things
because I have so many more but the last
imperfect thing about myself are my
hands um I have really really big scary
hands I tweeted about this earlier this
week look at it look my hands are
insanely
big and my fingers are really long and
not the skinniest person ever but you
know you have a face my hand is almost
as big as my face and then my fingers
are so freakin long it's like like I
tweeted I have Dumbledore hands they are
big skinny and long so those artists
things my lips my height and my hands
and then of course you have my taste
which I hate but that is what other
people see too so it's not imperfect
that you don't like about yourself and
other people sudden see it so now it's
time for the perfect things I like about
myself
um this was really hard to even think of
because I don't like things about myself
that much okay thing number one I really
like about myself are my nails um I hate
my hands but I like my nails because my
nails are like really really um big and
they're like really strong I always tell
people I have male hands because they're
big and everything but what I always
notice about boys is that they have
really strong nails and really um low
no bats cuticles and um I'm exactly like
that I have like really big hands and my
nails are really strong and um they have
a lot of space to play with so yeah I
like my nails just because I can do so
many things with them um they're at this
jordiz right now
you see there's nothing like peeling out
on top so this is the shortest and I
really like it because I still have a
lot of space to play with okay sing
number two um my attitude you can ask
everyone around me what they think of me
but I mean 99% of the hundred says that
when I'm around it's a party and I kind
of do that on purpose
um I always want to be nice to people
eight now in real life on the
their net everywhere I'm a really like
soft person I mean when I'm around I
want people to laugh I want people to
have a good time I want people to enjoy
and what I especially hate is when girls
come into a room and the entire mood of
the room goes like I personally hate it
when girls do that when they like drop
the entire mood of the room and that's
why I'm always happy around people I'm
always smiling
I'm always giving compliments people
because I think people deserve to get
compliments every day like oh your hair
is so nice like oh your makeup is nice
your lashes are so pretty
um I think people like I think people
enjoy to hear good things about
themselves and it's good to hear good
things about yourself
so I I'm always really happy alive I
always smile I always make jokes
just like in my videos and um I don't
know I'm just really happy all the time
and sometimes it can get on peoples
nerves
sometimes when I was in elementary
school actually my teacher picked me out
of the room and he said you know Nicky
you are a person that lifts the mood up
in a room and that is a really good
thing to do and not a lot of people can
do that so that really are so nice of
him to say I was seven when he said that
go figure
best perfect thing about myself is my
eye color I always get comments like you
have such pretty blue eyes and I'm like
nah they're not blue if you take a look
at my eyes it's not really blue blue
it's not like whoa they're blue and it's
know like rodent green I always tell
people I have green blue eyes I'm a
mixture yeah I kind of like my eye color
because it's not green and it's not blue
it's like a mixture of both which makes
teal or something
um so yeah that completes this um my
perfect imperfections tag um if you're
wondering this entire video why are you
wearing a lei Gaga wig it has one reason
is just to give you guys a hint you know
like a little sneak peek you know so
because I'm wearing this you kind of
know what's coming in the near future on
my channel um so that completes my
perfect imperfections tag video I'm
gonna be as annoying as everyone else
I'm gonna tag all of ya ah I love you a
lot um I do please take a look at my
website making tutorials comm for um for
a blog post on my shoes and on my nails
