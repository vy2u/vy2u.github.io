really exciting news um let's just get
riding nikkietutorials my channel my
youtube channel the the channel where
you watching this video on right now
they're reached over 200,000 subscribers
um first of all holy crap and my
brains have been processing this for
like two days now and I still can get it
like we got 200,000 subscribers and it's
not like I've seen my subscribers is
like a number but it's just like holy
 it's like 200,000 it's a
lot so from the bottom of my heart I
want to thank each and every one of you
for subscribing for for commenting for
rating for liking holy crap so in order
to celebrate I thought it would be fun
to tell you my youtube story because um
I've been doing YouTube for four years
now longer than four years and I've
never told you guys I never told you
guys how I started I mean I did TV
interviews tuna melons and I told the
story about 20 times out but I never
told you so I thought today was kind of
fun to tell you how I rolled into
YouTube and what has been going on
lately so it all started four years ago
I was sick and I was watching TV in my
bed and my bad is right behind me that
is this is my bedroom
I always film here and I was watching
the hills on MTV I had never seen that
show before so I kind of well as you
know the girls are really pretty and
there's so much drama going on so as a
14-year old I was like totally sucked
into it to the hills and there was a
weekend break so the entire weekend I
was in my bed watching the Hales because
I was sick because I thought that Lauren
and Heidi and all the other girls looked
so pretty I wanted to look like them I
felt sick I felt ugly and I just wanted
to look like them immediately I went to
my PC and I typed in YouTube and then I
searched for the hills makeup and what I
found was a girl called sandy gold and
she did a video called wake up and
makeup and she was in bed laying
sleeping
and then she would um have this intro
where her alarm went off and then she
was like ah and then wake up and then
make up and then in her bathroom she
showed you how to do some makeup looks
and the first one I watched was for a
Lauren Conrad I loved it loved the
makeup loved everything about it was
just a simple smoky smudged out I call
him the lash line but I loved it I was
obsessed with Cindy gold and I started
watching all her videos and she had so
many amazing tricks and then I found out
about this completely new world to me
like a world full of girls showing how
to do makeup I remember penisy i-81
being huge back then so that Monday I
got better and I took my bike and I went
to the drugstores and I got some basic
products when I saw brush I would be
like wha justice do you wipe your ass
with this I went home and I went into my
bathroom and I started practicing on my
face now of course it look like it
looked horrible
like horrendous I look like Michael
Myers but it was so much fun and it was
so much fun to kind of look back at the
video and then look at how I did and
what I could improve and then just keep
on practicing so I kind of started
playing with makeup more and more and I
started buying more products from eBay
and I don't know what and then I started
practicing and practicing and practicing
and then after around three months I I
was like I have to do this like I have
to start making those videos as well one
of the many questions I get from a lot
of Dutch people because I am Dutch I am
from the Netherlands I always get
questions like why did you start doing
videos in English because sandy Gould
did it because pennis t81 did it you
know I was like oh my god they're
speaking English I have to do that to
you because I want to be then I started
taping my first video I kind of stole my
mum's on the digital camera and it had a
video standing on it so I could film I
believe it was the Sony cyber-shot that
is what I used and I just have my
complete old room like
this crap together and I have my box my
like my audio thing there and I would
just place my camera on it I still had
my music on and I would just look in my
mirror and do my makeup without any good
lighting a horrible horrible angle and
my accent was the worst accent you can
possibly imagine the typical Dutch
English sort of accent that a lot of
Dutch people have here so I stopped
filming and I would go to Windows Movie
Maker and I would start kind of editing
and chopping pieces out and putting
pieces back in and I don't know and just
making it one video then I had to make a
new YouTube account because my previous
account was one of those horrible like
MSN account names like I thought he was
like ex glamour girl ex 102 UI I didn't
really know what to call myself I knew a
lot of people did make up by and then
their name or I don't know but because
these videos were called tutorials I was
like why don't I just call myself Nicki
that's my name and then tutorials like
why not so I kind of just called myself
nikkietutorials
and then I started uploading my very
very first video and I just waited
waited behind my PC just waiting for
something to happen and then I believe
like eight hours after I got my very
first comments I I was like oh my god
somebody watched this somebody had seen
my face and they saw me apply makeup I
was like oh my god someone saw me and
then if you started going up I went from
zero views to eight views I was like
eight people watched me I was like I
have to do this every week like I want
to do something with this so in that
year that I started doing videos I taped
a video every single Saturday and I
would edit it and put it up and put it
on my channel and just do that for every
single week that year after about a year
I reached the
33000 mark subscribers mark and I was I
did not get it and my family didn't know
that I did these videos so it was kind
of like my second life then on a weekend
my family discovered my videos and I
kind of explained myself but the best
thing was that they loved it they liked
what I was doing they were surprised
that it was in English and they were
like but then after a couple of months
my brother emailed the the tin half and
that is a Dutch newspaper with like hey
my sister does these videos and can you
check them out because I want you to see
them
but then the biggest dutch newspaper
actually wrote an article about me and i
got in the newspapers and then this sort
of snowball effect came and I was in so
many shows in Belgium in Dunellen 's and
I was just like fifteen years old so I
was like what the hell then the media
sort of let me alone and I started doing
more videos then I got a new camera I
started buying new lights and stuff so I
did that for about a year as well and my
audience started growing and subscribers
started growing
I eventually passed you one hundred
thousand subscribers mark I went up and
up and up I became a YouTube partner a
couple of months ago I went to Berlin to
you shot the Volkswagen commercial which
was absolutely insane and then after
that as well because there was quite a
shocking video the Dutch press wanted to
interview me even international news
when it's you interview me and now we I
have reached that 200000 subscribers
mark and it's insane because I got
bullied when I was a kid like a lot for
so many stupid things and I now have
200,000 subscribers which was just
really hard to kind of like wow like
oh I I don't get it really I never
thought that this bullied 14 year old
who was quite fat and they're brown
short hair and I don't know we just
started filming videos in a room could
get so many subscribers and so many
things have changed I have grown at
become a different person personality
wise because I've became much more
confident with myself and we did it huh
I hate when I grind videos because I
always cry even curved Pokemon so that
is my youtube story I love this I love
what I'm doing I love everything about
the YouTube thing of course you have
those haters but I mean I'm putting my
face up on the Internet of course you
could get haters not everyone is going
to love you and now four years later I'm
18 years old I I am now a professional
makeup and hair artist I am in an agency
where I do shoots I do shows I even
worked for Molly Claire in the
Netherlands I did um like I did a shoot
with the Dutch Olympic women like a
phenomenal movie Jojo and um a magic bow
Meister I I worked with that first
student was so fun and I was like I'm
working for Marie Claire today like I
hope I kind of helped you out with um
just if you want to start doing videos
by any means just do it I mean I didn't
know what I was doing in the beginning
and look at me now I also want to thank
makeup geek because she mentored me in
like the first couple of months she told
me like a couple of things about
lighting and setup so I really really
want anything really not makeup geek oh
