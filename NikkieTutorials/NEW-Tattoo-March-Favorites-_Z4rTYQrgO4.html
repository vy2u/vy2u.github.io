favored equal fun yeah hey guys so today
I'm going to show you my new tattoo that
I got two days ago plus I am going to
show you some of my all monthly
favourites because I didn't want to
dedicate this entire video to my new
tattoo so I'm going to throw some
favorites in there Isabella yo and god I
already have this tattoo right here
which says if you can see that it says
never give up I always wanted the quote
never give up on me but um then a couple
of months back I came up with don't
waste your life hiding and now it's on
me
so this is my new tattoo it says don't
waste your life hiding and it's about I
have really big hands but um that is
about how big it is and so if you ever
got a tattoo you know that they start
off with shaving the skin where the
tattoo is going to be but I think that
the alcohol that he put on top I really
irritated my skin because the tattoo
itself isn't really that rep but like
the skin around it the shaven stuff is
to really read it was some of the
amazing tattoo artists yell Nitta um he
is amazing he does amazing stuff and
even these like simple tattoos he does
like amazing I love him but like I love
his work but not as far as the quote
don't waste your life hiding I came up
with it myself never heard it anywhere
else or something but I always wanted
never give up on me and then this don't
waste your life hiding it's just like it
is what it is you know don't waste your
life hiding don't go sit in a corner and
hide yourself for the true person we
really are don't hide for others
people's like reactions to you or their
opinions about you just be yourself and
love yourself for who you are also I'm
going to show you this is why I love it
so much what I love about it so much is
that on one arm will never give up sort
of stops on the other arm
don't waste your life hiding continues
so that is what I really like um so yeah
those are big tattoos so that's enough
about the tattoo let's go on to some of
my favorites first I really want
show you these China Glaze prismatic
chroma glitters collection these are
insane these are like glitters duochrome
glitters duochrome glitter glitters my
camera doesn't really show it but this
is liquid crystal and it has a glitter
like it's full of glitter but it has a
dual Grumman at which my camera showed
that in anyway
god damnit why don't you see that my
favorites of the collection are full
spectrum full spectrum you can see the
duochrome in it because the duochrome is
pink and then when you switch it it
becomes a gold polarizing is also just
amazing it's not really a duochrome but
it has amazing colour glitters in it
love this collection then also I want to
talk about these face front flashlights
highlighting powders and I have talked
about these in I don't know if those
videos are up yet but in some videos I
talked about this but these are
highlighting powders and they are
amazing they are called my favourite is
double exposure which is like a nice
pinky color it is the bomb and this is
autofocus which is more of like a a
white goldish one
this is autofocus can't see the shimmer
that it gives oh just put that over your
face and be like oh and right next to it
is double exposure so can you see how
nice and illuminating and how shiny and
I just glowy these are and look when the
light is not hitting them they really
blend into your skin I really really
love these these are by face run and my
mom sells is in our webshop but also the
lipstick that I'm wearing today is by
Illamasqua and this is called box and
this was in their new um human blah blah
Tellis isms ISM collection this is a
true True Blood
bright red it's matte it's beautiful
it's the like it applies like a dream
therefore my favorite mascara this is by
makeup studio waterproof 3d extra blank
if you watch my videos
you're literally here we go again with a
damn word um you know that my lashes
suck and I always complain about my
lashes sucking and they're just look and
it just gives my lashes length curl it
holds a curl because it's waterproof but
it's not that waterproof that you cannot
get it off your skin or lashes for
goddamn how long rubbing and then let's
go that leaves my beautiful fabulous new
sunglasses these are by a sauce and a
sauce is the bomb I love the south east
sunglasses but I wanted to like make
them a little bit more catchy so I also
purchased a chain which says oh my god
because that is like the thing I say the
most in my entire life I feel like Lady
Gaga mixed with Samantha from Sex in the
City because of the oh my god and then
just be fabulous with it
uh if I ever had an eye infection and I
wanted to film a video this would be on
my face so yet that is all from me today
