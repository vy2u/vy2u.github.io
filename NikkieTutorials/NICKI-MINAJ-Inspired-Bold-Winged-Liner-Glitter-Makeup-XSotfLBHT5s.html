tutorial inspired by Miss Nicki Minaj
I'm so excited when I saw this look on
her Instagram and she posted a lot of
photos on her Instagram with this look
and when Nicki does that when she posts
the same look over and over and over you
know she was still in herself yeah I
just absolutely love the look it's a
fierce bold winged liner with the
glitter oh of course
more glitter on my channel beautiful
golden glow a skin and just a lot of
sass and a lot of fabulousness and just
a lot of Nicki Minaj and I love hugs
yeah if you would like to know how to
get this Nicki Minaj inspired makeup
look right here then keep on watching
all right so the first problem I'm gonna
go in with is by Becca and this is the
Becca backlight priming filter and I got
this because if Jeffrey stars so let's
apply to the fix Oh smells divine
oh the glow it gives Ohio right after
I'm going in with my tatcha luminous
dewy skin miss everyone has been talking
about this and I I just needed to try it
and I love love the packaging so much
and I've heard a lot of people say that
it acts better as the primer as to post
to a finishing spray so I'm gonna use it
as both okay for foundation today I want
to look absolutely flawless because
Nicki looked flawless so I'm gonna go
for my Make Up For Ever Ultra HD
foundation Stix and I'm in the color 117
and 120 so when 20 goes on the outer
perimeter of the face I am loving that
Becca primer so okay and then 117 on the
inner perimeter of the face
and then blend in using my beauty
blender for concealer I'm going to go in
with the new Make Up For Ever Ultra HD
concealer and I'm in the color y21 and
I've tried it a couple of times now and
it's actually really really good and I
love it in combination with the sticks
so you might want to check them out and
I love that y21
actually is SuperDuper away because uh
spill Pastis need it out there
and now sending with powder to prevent
it from creasing
I'm just starting off by priming my
eyelids using suffer for Paint Pot by
Mac and this will keep the shadows on
all day long for the crease of first
going in with two Urban Decay eye
shadows this right here is riff and
mixing it with faint and I'm applying
that using a Mac two to four brush aid
you want the mixture to lean a little
bit more towards risk than faint because
stains can get really cool tone and dark
and with a clean blending brush with
nothing on it I'm just going to blend
the edges for a smooth finish for the
lid I'm taking this color pop super
shock shadow in number three and
applying this using a mac 242 brush as a
base for my pigment I'll use the heavy
metal glitter liner by Urban Decay
called Midnight Cowboy and the pigment
I'll be applying over top is by Mac and
this is reflect antique gold and
applying those with a makeup studio
number 17 brush
for the lower lashline I'm taking the
same crease colors and the morphe 43 and
applying it to the outer corners of my
lower lash and she highlighted taking
this Mac shaping powder in emphasize and
that's time for that crazy winged
eyeliner I'll first be going in with
this blink ultra-thin liquid eyeliner
pen and just look at the tip of this
this is perfect for that ultimate fine
tip now hopping over to my Kat Von D
tattoo liner in trooper to connect the
outline and finally hopping over to my
Sigma line ace in legend to fill
everything in and to perfect the shape
now all you want to do is apply some
falsies and these are by Hutta beauty
and they're called Farah
okay moving on to cheeks I'm first going
to contour because Nicki Minaj's cheeks
are just so I wanted to change things up
a little bit if you have the Urban Decay
Gwen Stefani palette a perfect
contouring shade for pill beauties is
Anaheim Anaheim eyeshadow from the
palette is perfect for contouring so I'm
going to use that for contouring today
with that morphe M five-30 brush my
favorite for an additional bronze to my
face and going into the Zoe that nude
spectrum blush palette and a little bit
mixture with this color right here and a
little bit of that a little bit of that
and I'm going to apply this as a bronzer
blush and the brush will be using for
that is my Mac 135 and to highlight am
first going in with Anasazi Beverly
Hills so Hollywood and of course my
favorite highlighting brush by morphe my
m3 10
also the news in Cuba's wool and I'm
using that a sort of a base highlight
and I'm making the highlight pop using
moonstone shimmering skin perfecter by
Becca going over top to make it even
more intense and amaze BAM
now that is what we call a golden glow
that way you can also really control the
glow because you're putting the base
glow on and they're really making
certain features pop using the pop of
glow okay not I have done all of that
I'm going to finish off by spraying some
more tatcha luminous dewy skin mists all
over my face okay that's it for the face
for lips we want to keep them nude and
glossy and not too done so first I'm
going in with this la girl matte
lipstick in la la and this is a
beautiful color and that is going to go
all over making it a little bit warmer
using yash lipstick by Mac
and then for a little bit of gloss I'm
going to use Anasazi Burghley Hills
gilded lip gloss and that guy's
