makeup challenge
I tell it so I turned away all the
mirrors in my room and don't even try to
leave those common thing I'm looking at
certain waves or a certain angle so
there must be a mirror there no there
are no mirrors here nowhere and if I
stare into my softbox that's probably
because I'm asking my stop boxes so the
lighting further ado let's do this I'm
going in with my Kogan doha aqua
foundation and i'm applying it using my
tweezer man contour foundation brush and
i'm just gonna pick them up with that
brush and we're gonna do this oh oh god
I feel like tippling motion it's what we
bots for this oh wait I forgot my
forehead forehead on fleek though nose
just gonna dab my life away right now
okay now it's the time where I feel like
real suck up could happen I'm going in
with some concealer see
no it's just
ciserek this is the tip of my nose yes
okay I'm not just gonna blend it all in
using a sponge and I feel like the more
I tap it in with a sponge the safer it
will be I'm just gonna keep on blending
for an hour here okay here comes the eye
portion and now I think I got this in
the bag because usually when I feel my
regular tutorials where I actually do
have mirrors I kind of pose this portion
as well because I always liked it better
when I do this I don't know if anyone's
ever noticed I just post that portion a
little bit because I feel like it's
nicer to look at so I feel like
under-eye area should be nice okay okay
now would be a good time to bake so I'm
picking up loose powder and then just
gonna bake my under-eye yeah okay now
would be a good time for brows and I
usually do my brows using my brow Wiz by
honest about savory hills in taupe
it's my brow
okay okay we're doing this yes yes okay
let's go with that March Oh God oh that
felt wrong you know how sometimes you
brush something onto your face and you
don't see it but it feels ugly so I'm
going with it right now just for my arch
goes just gonna feel some in and then in
the front a couple of hair like strokes
so give me this to read that - I feel
like a dick short and sassy although it
feels very long like very long strokes
brow can you see it from here okay now
I'm gonna set that with a brow gel and
it's tinted just to make my life to have
much easier today
and I'm brushing away my big just
setting the masterpiece that created
going in with my bronzer this should be
fairly easy I'm just gonna aim for my
cheekbones so kind of blend it out and
judge it out and kind of contour with it
as well I'm probably overdoing it by now
I never put this much bronzer on what am
i doing hmm I feel like with this video
whenever I think I've blended enough I
should blend some more let's do the
forehead because we want our forehead
bronzing to be on fleek
jawline and since I don't actually have
a really prominent jawline I don't even
know if I'm at my jawline right now okay
next I'm gonna go in and contour using
my Bobbi Brown eyeshadow in wheat just
to enhance the features a bit more this
forehead contour and then with a
foundation brush I'm just gonna because
I feel like I piled it on so bad I'm
just gonna tone it down a little bit
using my foundation brush and I told
myself to push myself to the limit so
I'm also gonna contour my nose okay
let's do the tip oh god I I see just
flailing from it can I look at it like
this is this cheating cuz I can actually
see my tip now then again in the end
making a little bit softer using that
condition brush cuz I probably went too
far with that so I'm gonna prime using
my soft ochre Paint Pot and buffing
blend
I got keep looking into my products like
how we do I look like shit okay
for ice today I'm going to use my morphe
35c palette and first going in with the
light color to set the darker paint pot
because of course we want perfect
blending and I find that putting a
lighter shade all over just helps me
blend
so first I'm going to go in with a
transition color and go in with this
light pink right here because I feel
like I could use all the transition
shades I can have wait let me do the
Chris B method push it push it in and
then blend and then that way she tells
you that the underneath portrait is
gonna be sharp and the top or she was
gonna be blended and fluffy okay next
I'm gonna pick up one of these Moroney
shades please please don't be too
pigmented first the outer corner that's
what I always do and then bring it into
the and just I'm gonna keep blending for
an hour now I keep looking over there
into my softbox just wishing for my
lights to stay like you look like shit I
swear I don't have any mirrors or
anything I can see myself with even near
me so I was I'm just looking at random
things like now thinking please tell me
this is going well so I'm picking up the
silver and I know I don't any fallouts
I'm blocking it with happening I'm
blocking the fallout from happening
again oh I actually caught the oh my god
and then all the way up to the crease
for like the cut crease feel then I'm
going back in with my pinky shades
because I always do this after apply my
lip color I feel like I have to go back
in with my crease colors do you like
give it a nice cuz he's the blend you
without having okay for the lower lash
line I'm taking my 35o palette buy more
feet I'm gonna go for a night like
orange e brownish terracotta somewhere
color somewhere I love that under-ice
smokiness so today is probably that plus
a whole lot more smoke okay now we need
to highlight those inner corner so I'm
picking up a highlighter shade I told
myself to do a nose contour so I should
probably do eyeliner also what I want to
do this oh god it's all my I did that do
anything oh God
fill in oh this hurts my makeup art
now filled in
Oh God okay now I'm gonna apply some
mascara and I'm gonna use my Too Faced
better than sex where do you look
without a mirror for lashes are gonna
use the new hood a beauty Sascha's which
are so nice and big and full and I feel
like that would cover up my pretty bad
eyes I guess all right so I put glue on
the first one so as I'm waiting for that
glue to dry I'm just gonna do my blush
and today I'm using Mac's love cloud and
again using one of these brushes which I
also use to bronze with evening on the
apples
I feel like cheeks are the easiest okay
I'm gonna put that lash on oh it's on
Oh putting the glue on again okay so as
this Blache is drying I'm gonna do my
glow you know what I'm just using this
brush again so niggas for my bronzer
blush I know it's so nerve-wracking oh
my gosh Cupid's bow okay oh okay to
finish off I need some lips and of
course I'm pushing my stuff today so I'm
gonna go for something harder to do
we're not gonna go for a new that would
be the easy way out I want to go for
like a dark dark red this is Heather's
my honest boss a Beverly Hills you know
what I'm just gonna do it okay
honey do I look crazy
