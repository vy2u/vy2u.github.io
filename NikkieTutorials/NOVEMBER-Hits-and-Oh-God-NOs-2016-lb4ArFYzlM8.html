hits I know God knows I cannot for the
life of me cope with the fact that
November is over and we're landed upon
December it's the last month of the year
the most the wind lives just time of the
day year oh my god I personally love
December
I love how glam everything gets and all
the lights everywhere and I just love
December I love Christmas I love
spending time with my family so to be
saying goodbye to November is crazy but
I'm so ready for it anyways guys without
any further ado if you would like to
know what my hits and oh God knows were
for the month of November then keep on
watching alright so the first product I
want to mention is the clinic take the
day off cleansing balm now I saw this
everywhere on YouTube and I was kind of
skeptical about this because I am a true
and firm believer of oils to take your
makeup off with it just it gets it all
up so quickly and it is what has worked
for me for all these years so to see
people really really rave about the
Clinique bomb in it piques my interest
and finally I bought it a couple of
weeks ago and I must say I am really
really impressed by this and I'm gonna
be like so real with you right now I
know for a fact that Clinique has done a
lot of sponsorships lately so I'm not
gonna lie I took it with a little grain
of salt I wasn't sure if people actually
loved it so I just strap down my balls
and when I haven't tried it and I've
been loving it ever since you only need
the tiniest amount which I like because
it is pricey but you only need a tiny
little bit and then you massage your
face with it and then you will see your
makeup melting off you rinse it off with
water and you're clean as a baby but
baby but so I'm a huge fan of how little
you need to actually take a thick layer
of makeup off with I am highly impressed
by that I don't necessarily like the
price on this because I cannot use this
on my eyes I prefer a solo eye makeup
remover to really get all my waterproof
hardcore makeup off with before the face
this is awesome it is
a little pricey but it does what it's
supposed to do and I'm really really
impressed by it and I'm not sponsored to
say that so there you go next up another
skincare product I've been really
obsessed with and I know it looks like I
use nothing but again you only need a
tiny little bit plus it has a backstory
character development
this right here is by pixi it is called
the skin treats glow tonic exfoliating
toner with 5% of that hand it's ratchet
five percent glycolic acid aloe vera and
ginseng this stuff I've used this for I
think a year two years ago and you know
how you use certain skincare products
for a long time you're like why am I
even using that I feel like it's not
doing anything for Riskin I kind of had
that feeling with this one I toss it
away for about a year and I notice my
skin just not being like it's true
normal self and I did some research and
I was like it's got to be the toner that
I tossed because ever since it hasn't
been the same so I bought this again I
believe you can get this at Target it's
by pixi and I use this right after
cleaning my face with the Clinique and I
just tone my face with it and it it does
kind of tingle it kinda doesn't burn but
it gives you a warming tingle and I like
that because I feel like stuff is
actually happening when I feel that
tingle on my face I really feel it
cleaning of my skin and setting all the
pH levels back to neutral and I love
that and it actually does leave your
skin looking glowing after so I'm really
glad this is back in my life I've used
it for about three weeks now you only
need the tiniest bit and I like rubbing
it in those problem areas and it gets me
right and clean and I'm really impressed
by the stuff and it's affordable which I
like as well oh gosh by the way before
anyone comments what is on my lips on my
lips I'm wearing Dee Kylie matte liquid
lipstick in ginger and I topped it off
with this g'way lip topper in tan lines
this is now back in stock so it's been
out of stock for a while so if you
planes can you give me a minute
here I know this has been out of stock
for quite a bit but it's now back in
stock so if you want it you can
get it you should be quick because they
go fast but if you're wondering that is
what is on my lips today plain though
disrespectful to my viewers really
alrighty next up I have this Mac
foundation called the pro longwear
nourishing waterproof foundation and I
have had this for a long time and I used
it and I mean I liked it but it didn't
leave like a WoW
impression with me it had beautiful
coverage but I don't know what did it
that didn't make it stick with me
so a couple of weeks ago I did my Perrie
Edwards Little Mix shout-out to my ex
makeup tutorial and I know that Perry's
makeup artist actually use this
foundation on her further music video so
that's why I incorporated it into my
video and ever since that video I've
been obsessed with this stuff right here
it is high coverage but it's a thin
layer it's high coverage but you don't
need to work for it it feels so
lightweight and amazing on the skin and
what really sells it to me is that it
stays on so beautifully throughout the
day and the term waterproof foundation
actually is I trusted I believe it
because I noticed when I use this
foundation I have a really ugly t-zone
and I notice that with this foundation
my t-zone doesn't get quite as oily as
with other foundations so I am impressed
with this maybe it is perfect for long
makeup days where you want to make sure
that your face is intact all day long I
am highly impressed I highly recommend
this if you want a medium to full
coverage foundation that lasts and lasts
and lasts baby also one of my recent
videos I was using the new la girl pro
conceal foundation and we all know how
that kind of ended up looking on me and
they came up with a white foundation in
that range and I told you guys how I
kind of wished there was a white
concealer well maybe in the comments you
came through and you let me know that
they have a white concealer so I went
out and bought it
and I'm not gonna lie the first time I
got it I was like um but it is a
highlighter it is shiny it looks like a
glow I don't necessarily want my under
eye lines to glow and get attention but
it isn't until you really squirt hate
that word it isn't no to really squeeze
the product out is when you get the
white concealer I feel like the
concealer has a high almost glow to it
it isn't a glitter it isn't what it is a
little bit shiny it has a glow to it and
at first that put me off because who
wants white glowy under eyes I actually
kind of want that but you know what I'm
saying here it kind of put me off until
I mix it with another concealer and it
just gradually makes the concealer you
mix it with to lighten it it just makes
it glow so beautifully and it really
enhances the under eye area and yeah I'm
really happy with this with this I can
now lighten any concealer foundation and
it leaves a beautiful glow to it a
setting spray I've been obsessed with is
by NYX this right here is called the
dewy finish the setting spray and they
come in two versions they have the dewy
and they have the matte I have both but
I gravitate towards the dewy one more
because I feel like the match almost
kind of makes you look too matte and
although I love a matte phase and
blinding areas it makes your overall
makeup look a little bit more natural
when you have a more dewy finish on your
face so I like going in with the spray
right after I finished my entire look I
just spritz for spritz spritz spritz and
it just transforms any excessive powder
into a nice dewy skin version of the
powder people always ask me how I avoid
looking too cakey and this is a secret
right here when you feel like you have
too much powder on there or you went in
a little bit too hard with the baking or
you just feel like it's all a little bit
too much try
spraying with a makeup setting spray and
it will all just kind of melt the makeup
together and make it look nice and
natural and beautiful and photoshopped
and flawless it's one of my favorite
tricks to do and I've been really really
enjoying the NYX dewy finish makeup
setting spray because it just it does
what it's supposed to do and it makes me
look radiant and dewy so that is what I
want from the finishing spray and is
doing that so I highly recommend it plus
it's affordable next up I just have to
talk about this eyeshadow palette right
here this is my color train and if we're
talking about color brain
I feel like color grain is one of the
most underrated makeup brands out there
I feel like a lot more people should be
talking about color train because the
quality of their products is insane they
are so pigmented buttery and easy to
work with and it kind of hurts my
feelings that almost nobody is talking
about them so I am here to share the
light on their newest launch this right
here is the Queen of Hearts eyes shadow
palette and I use it in my previous
video I have shown this on snapchat but
this palette is so beautiful for fall
and winter it has a perfect mix of matte
colors hi shiny colors a little bit less
shiny colors it's just a gorgeous
gorgeous palette just color right here
called Air Royal Prerogative Dutchess
are all beautiful neutral colors I'm
wearing the palette on my eyes today
I think the shimmers are so incredibly
pigmented like look look
BAM baby like the payment on this
palette is absolutely surreal and for
the price point this retails for I
believe $45 $45 or 5045 or 50 for this
palette right here you get high quality
makeup that will help you blend like a
pro that will make your makeup look just
so beautifully done without putting too
much effort into it it just glides on
the eye so easily and beautifully
I really wish a lot more people are
talking about color green I highly
believe in this palette right here it
comes with with rose 12 colors
twelve colors twelve beautiful richly
pigmented colors and I cannot stop
raving about this pallid if you are on
the hunt for colors like this I highly
suggest you taking a look at this
palette right here I love color train as
a brand they are so genuine and so real
and kind of need this in your life guys
okay of course this one you saw this
someone coming from a mile away the road
dial contour powder okay let me let me
get this straight here the road dial
instaglam compact Deluxe contouring
powder in number three
ever since I picked this baby up I
haven't looked at my Kevin Taquan medium
sculpting medium sculpting powder
enhancer thingy
ever since I picked this one up I
haven't even thought about that one this
has just such a first time I thought I
was kind of scared because it has such a
cool undertone I was like that is gonna
look like mud on my face but I went and
with my brush I conjured my cheekbones
to filth and it just looked right it
just looked perfect it looked like a
shadow it looked like my cheeks were
naturally enhanced all because of this
powder now do I think this fits all skin
tones absolutely not I think if you are
anywhere from NC 35 and up I think this
is going to be too ashy on you just
keeping it real with you but if you are
more on the light fair skin tone range I
think this is stunning on you it
naturally sculpts the face so
beautifully and ever since I've gotten
this I haven't been able to put it down
I love the packaging it has like faux
leather and like the chrome and just the
are bar I think it's a really really
high-quality contouring powder so I
really highly recommend it and yeah if
you're on the hunt for a new contour
powder
check this one out last but certainly
not least I want to talk about a
fragrance that I've been obsessed with
this one is by Senza and it is a New
York glamorous Fifth Avenue oh the
bottom of the Buffalo this is a perfume
that I got gifted to by my mom love you
mom she knows I love for
Agron says and I love anything like
sweet but mysterious and maybe that's
this right here this is I describe it as
a sweet mysterious ride through a
mysterious park being followed by your
crush waiting to be kissed in the glow
lights does that even make sense it's
just it's it's right it's just so
beautiful and sexy and confident
yeah thank you so much mom for gifting
this to me I love love love it look how
much I use already I love it I've only
had this for about three weeks so that's
it guys those were all my hits for the
month of November and without any
further ado let's go right on to the oh
god no oh yeah no this right here is the
foundation primer in hydrating by Laura
Mercier and I bought this because I
heard great things about Laura Mercier
as a brand and I heard great things
about her primers and everyone is raving
about that powder which I don't
necessarily love too much either I felt
like there was so much love and trust
for Laura Mercier products so I felt at
ease buying this primer from her I know
she does a lot of primers and this one
right here is hydrating because like I
said I have a oily t-zone really dry
outer portion of my face I need that
hydration and moisturization
but I also need something that is going
to keep my makeup on longer and uh this
primer right here it does neither of all
the above I put this on and I just
massage it into my face and I feel like
it's not doing anything it doesn't
improve longevity of my makeup it
doesn't make my face feel more softened
or moisturized it doesn't really do a
whole lot for me other than just putting
a soft sticky layer onto my face of
nothing that vibrates into thin air in
seconds it hurts me because it's a pricy
primer pricy primer in all honesty
you're better off saving your coins and
going for the NYX hydro
I've been really liking this one as well
compared to the laura mercier the next
one actually does hydrate and prepares
your skin for makeup and I feel like
this is just not do anything and that
guys is where I'm going to put a stop at
it those were my hits and a God knows
