enjoyed my last video which was my I
miss vlog today I'm going to show you
everything that I bought in New York at
IMATS and New York itself and that's it
it's gonna be a very long video so I'm
gonna shut up now let's go to the hall
okay the first thing I want to talk
about are some new brushes that I got
the first one is by Tom Ford and it's
this blush brush and I the woman on the
at the counter she tested it on me and
it felt like Bambi pooped on my face it
is softer than anything you had ever
imagined if you're thinking of a soft
brush this is softer I use it every day
since I got it I love this brush it is
so amazing
I wanna marry it then and I met I made a
pit-stop and Hakuhodo
and they have amazing brushes I got this
orange one this is called the s-1 13
love this orange color I love the entire
feel of it and I use this as a
highlighter brush actually yesterday I
did a shoot again with the amazing
photographer Bianca oops and I use this
as a highlight brush for we did really
nice highlight at skinning today as well
and I love it it is so it's like the
perfect size for highlighting another
Haku owner brush I got is it doesn't
have a name but it's like a really
really really big crease brush it's like
the 217 but blow nothing bigger so it's
just like an an exploded bigger brother
version of it but I love the hunka one
it is so easy to get someone's creats in
with it especially on other people like
yesterday at the shoot and I used it in
every single model looked gorgeous and
it was done in like seconds okay just to
be sure I am NOT bald I have hair I'm
gonna zoom you in because you can't
really see the products but not that you
are like oh she's bald no not next I
want to show you this tum Fort lipstick
I got and this is the number nine true
coral and look at this it's an amazing
color I love this I used it
that again yesterday on the shoot I love
this it's the perfect bright coral
orange color from Mac I got two new skin
finishes the extra dimensions skin
finishes in whisper of guilt which it
looks like that this is amazing and I
don't want to be annoying but I use this
on set yesterday as well and it is
gorgeous on photo shoes it's it's like a
whole different world also got suburb
and that is more of like a rosy gold one
but this is I mean look at that look at
the texture look at that shine look at
that that printed has like that that
like oh my god I just want to slap your
face and then from England I got one of
the most gorgeous big ones I have had in
my entire life it's on my inner corners
right now and it is like a mint bright
green shine it's perfect for
highlighting this is the Inca penguin in
number 45 and it is just like a shimmery
mint color I love me like a minty limey
goodness this is another eye liner by
Inglot and this is number 87 and I love
this the only problem with them is that
once they dry you cannot get them off
anymore well you can get them off with
like a really good remover but again I
used it on set yesterday and I did this
on a model and when you mess up you mess
up you cannot get it off again and you
have to ask the photographer to
photoshop it before I go to all the I
met stuff I want to show you my Kat Von
D lipstick in Agatha I am wearing it
right now it's like the perfect nude
this is I swear to you guys this is the
perfect nude for like girls like me so
if you're pale and pasty like me this is
the perfect nude and because of the
lovely Jen from head to toe I got the
Tarte blush in exposed she has been
talking about this non-stop and when
someone talks about it non-stop I'm like
I need to have that not just kind of
jump into all the I'm at stuff because
that is right
the most first thing I want to show you
is OCC one thing didn't happen though
they gifted me Queen Letarte and queen
letters like this gorgeousness
we met Risa RM like our semi last day
the day before the last day and she was
wearing it it's an amazing color and I
love it so much problem is it exploded
in my makeup bag and now my lik litters
have a really nice Queen infusion in
their packaging isn't that cool like
look at that it's all the way in the
packaging but I do have these amazing
colors and I love their lip tars this is
Ophelia Ophelia o philia beautiful baby
pink kava-kava benji digital lists clerk
file chlorophyll something to green and
then last but not least I got belladonna
beautiful purple and I also got a whole
stack of cool leaders I basically got
like every glitter they have and it also
got some pigments which are beautiful
this Risa was wearing this as a
highlight on the second day so if your
star or highlight from the second date I
met this is what you wore this is the
Torah which is a really nice cool pinky
shine and this is Oh Oberon Oberon she
mixed it with that to make it lighter
and then a lovely pigment I got is clove
which is a beautiful champagne II sort
of mid tone shiny brown color and the
next company I really really love is old
it I have heard a lot of them on YouTube
so that when I saw it and I met I went
balls
I got about ten glitters I'm not gonna
open them up for you but you won't even
be able to tell the colors from my
camera right now
because I'm not gonna open them all but
I got the most amazing glitters from lid
the one that got like infused by Queen
Letarte is a neon pink glitter I am
gonna show
this one because it is insane can you
see that that is the neon pink this is
glitter you guys this is glitter
oh I love this Julie gee the amazing
Julie g7 1:3 who is one of the most
beautiful genuine people persons in this
entire planet she has her own nail
polish line at Jessie's growing now and
I went ahead about some because I love
her and I want to support her and I want
to support her line I got oMG neon pink
fears and fab neon purple my private
palace which is sort of like a duo
chrome e gold white butterflies and
rosebuds which is a dark shimmering pink
purple with duo crumbs in it of a green
and a gold sunset kiss another duo

beautiful person she is so real so

them they are really good really good

Julie Armour lip glasses they were
sitting right next to OCC and these are
the color

they are amazing I love this color this
is called candy which is a really nice
this reminds me of Kelly Osbourne this
is this is Lucy hello grace and Marilyn
and I love the color so that is armor
lip glasses they Rock I got a bunch like
a bunch of lashes this is Miss adoro
never heard of them before but I love
them although I'm gonna be really honest
if the girl at the counter is a watching
this next time smell a bit more because
I felt like you hated me although I
bought like 13 pairs of

looked so angry I felt like oh my god

die

last but not least and I want to close
this video with this is the Neutrogena
Healthy Skin Foundation I bought this at
