Year's Eve look this is probably what I
am going to wear in this Saturday but
before I'm going to do that this is the
less I'm going to talk about it um
Twitter Person of the Year thank you so
much to everyone who voted for me
already
so my last humble question for now for
this year is to please put once more for
me someone less humble question of this
year is just to please spoke once more
or a couple times more for me for
Twitter Person of the Year Nell ins this
Saturday next Saturday before New Year's
Eve is happy day so you can fo for me
every hour so if you guys would please
vote for me once more for Twitter Person
of the Year that would mean the world to
me the link is right here also in the
info box below so if you wanted to vote
I will be so grateful if you don't then
then you don't so I'm gonna shut up
right now and let's just go to the look
so the first thing you want to do is
apply a baster I list to prevent all of
this from creasing and the one I'm using
is the Mac soft ochre pink pot okay so
then we're gonna take this 24/7 glide-on
shadow pencil from Urban Decay and this
is called sin eye what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna apply that on my entire lid
and I'm gonna take a retrospect
eyeshadow from Mac and this is a
beautiful luster color and I'm gonna
apply it wet on top of sin for a really
nice glamorous gold touch then we're
going to take another brush and apply
retrospect
on top of it now I'm gonna take this
really nice brown eye shadow from mecca
called cross-cultural and I'm just gonna
start defining the outer part of my
crease and going a little bit more into
it
and also a bit on the corners right here
to really deepen it up and then go in
and then I'm also going to make a really
slight point for that really nice
festive look I think I'm going to take
card I shadow from Mac and I'm just
gonna blend this baby boy out right here
in the crease and you can blend it as
much as you like it you can go into your
nose line you cannot go into your nose
line it's all up to you just make sure
that you kind of give it that smoked
blendy feeling then I kind of smoke it
up a little bit more with LMSs eyeshadow
and Wolfe darken that up on the outer
corners a bit more then for a brow
highlight I'm going to use the amazing
Too Faced absolutely invisible
candlelight powder this is heaven in a
pot I love this this is gorgeous apply
it as a brow bone highlight and I'm also
wearing it as a highlight on my
cheekbones I'm gonna use the Lancome eye
pencil in noir which is black I'm just
going to make my base for the black eye
shadow that is going on top I'm gonna
leave it a little spot open for the
silver glitter that is going on top and
that will really make it fire up
now I'm going to take a brush and blend
this out to make it a little bit more
smoky and a little bit more uh I'm gonna
take cross school troll again and blend
that out and a little bit down to give
it really that smoked up feeling and
then of course neither lashes I'm gonna
set it with a black and for that I'm
using this ultra glittery black right
here this is makeup studio reflex in
black okay for declaring on the is Max
silver glitter and I'm going to put that
on with a base and the base is from Le
splash and it is called liquid eyeliner
base and this is perfect for making
glitter stick so I'm just going to put
that on the open spot right there and
that will really open up the eyes
oh I love glitter but it's just a pain
to work with I love it
but just three years later and you're in
your room in your life
Oh didn't I use that like five years ago
it just gets everywhere now I'm gonna
put a black kohl on my waterline and
this is the Urban Decay 24/7 glide-on
eye pencil in zero and then another
place of mascara which is the makeup
studio water-resistant volume and apply
some corner lashes and corner elections
are like they go in the corners of your
eyes these are max number two and those
are two on top of each other so to make
one corner eyelash okay that's what I
write so then I decided to put on the
bottom I have this bag full of little
rhinestones and I'm just going to take
one and put some left glue on where I
want the rhinestones to be and then just
pop it on
and if that is where you want it just
kind of push it to your skin and wait
for it to dry and then you have this
really really nice rhinestone so I'm
gonna go for a little nice sweet pinky
Newt lip and I'm gonna go for ultimate
color be natural from Catrice which is a
really nice new color like a lot and I'm
gonna put a really teeny tiny bit of
pink on top and this is slow leaks
babydoll lipstick and that completes my
New Year's Eve look of this year so it's
not really a recommendation for
everybody but this is just what I'm
probably going to wear it in like two
days
because I'm posting this up tonight so
