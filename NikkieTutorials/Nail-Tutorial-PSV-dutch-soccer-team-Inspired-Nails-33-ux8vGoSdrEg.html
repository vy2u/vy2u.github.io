tutorial once again it's been a long
time since my last one and I love doing
these for you I'm gonna do a soccer team
inspired nail tutorial for you guys I
was inspired by PSP and that is a Dutch
soccer team in the Netherlands and I
love them I love
oh that toy Bona I love boats to talk I
love manga left I love them all but
basically I was inspired by their new
shirts which it's black white red blocks
and gold and I love this team
I live in ain't OVA so that is why I
love them
so go pace pay and if you want to know
how I did these meals then please keep
on watching
okay to start off this soccer inspired
nails you're going to apply a base and
this will make a smooth base for all the
polishes a nice thick nail MV by OPI the
next step is to apply one or two coats
of a black nail polish I'm gonna use
early in liquid vinyl and it depends on
how many coats I am gonna wear but I
think I'm gonna do two coats but you can
do whatever you like and we all know how
to apply nail polish right now so I'm
going to show you one nail just start in
the middle and then go to the sides and
then brush it out a little bit more to
share it out so it's not a thick layer
of black and then you're gonna let that
dry and do another coat so I'm going to
do two cups of liquid vinyl by aurélie
okay so I have two coats of the early
polish on and now I'm going to take to
render glazes white on white and what
I'm gonna do is cut off my nail like um
I'm taking a little bit of that white
and I'm just gonna cut a piece of it off
like that like that
doesn't have to be perfect but great
that is how you do it and you can do two
coats of this because it's not that
opaque but there is going to be a print
on top of it so you don't really have to
do two coats so cut off your nail I'm
gonna show you another one so just cut
it off like that I cut it up with white
pieces okay so for next step I'm gonna
take two cotton pads one is soaked with
nail polish remover and the other one is
just dry and I'm gonna take my cone app
plate in number 56 and it has a bow for
a French manicure and if you don't like
this theme for the stalker you can use
the hearts or the squirrels or I don't
know well but I'm gonna use those little
blocky things and since they use Rhett
in their shirts I'm going to use the red
special nail polish by conet and I'm
trying to open that and I'm taking it
I'm going on top of that print like that
then I take my scraper I scrape it off
wipe it off on that thing
take my Stamper remove excess that
shouldn't be there and then I'm going on
to my nails like that
and then you have the red blocks of
their shirts on your nails so then
you're going to clean the plate be
careful that you don't touch your nails
because then it will be white with
makeup remover and you don't want that
so then you are going to do the other
nail so take the wrap polish go on top
of that image take the scraper take it
scrape it off wipe it off on that
compact
take my stamp and then go on to my new
like that
this one's perfect oh my god I love it
so as you can see this one went
perfectly on there's a little bit on the
black but that doesn't matter because we
all have gold there so that is basically
what you want to do you're going to
apply the rev locks to the white space
on your nails and I'm gonna do that to
all of my nails and then I will show you
the last step for the nail design so be
right back okay I apply all the red
blocks to two white spaces on my nails
and I love this team and their shirts
and their logo has a bit of a gold
stroke and that is perfect for this nail
design so I'm gonna take my la colors
art deco and these polishes are really
cool because they don't open they do
open but they have a fine tip brush as
you can see and what I am going to do is
we place a gold stroke line under that
wide so that will be really cool so here
we go under that wide
like that for a nice cool glittery
effect and this is perfect for the
inspired team because they have a gold
stroke on their logo so if you want you
can do two coats of these glitters I am
going to do that so you know that's
basically it for glitter so I'm just
going to apply the glitter to all the
nails and then apply your top coat which
is going to be the cone at one I love
that one and then I will close this
video and talk about it and be right
back guys
so again I hope you like these nails and
I loved doing them I love PHP and thanks
for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
