right now I get this for the bitch log
contest video um and I have no meaning
to take it off right now I wash my face
because I needed to do this video first
um I get a meal tutorial my very first
one and I'm really excited about it um
yeah the window is open because um it's
really hot in here so I have to open
that stupid window so you will hear a
lot of noises so anyways the meals I did
aren't these ones they are really retro
and cool looking I really love them my
mom loves them I love them so that's
good I'm gonna use um brick honet stuff
so check out the tutorial and I hope you
like it I so I already went ahead and
applied my base coat which is new MV by
OPI so apply that to your nails as your
base coat now for the colors I'm gonna
do all the Omni 'ls like a holographic
black and I'm gonna use color club
revolution really great color and that
is going on four of my nails because I
want some of my nails to be a little bit
different like my ring finger so I
already went ahead and did that on this
hand I thought I was recording but I
wasn't really stupid this is one coat
and in a minute I will apply my second
coat of revolution and then I will apply
some white on white by China Glaze on my
ring finger so that's what I'm gonna do
so take your white on white and apply
this to your ring finger and this one
needs two coats as well
so that it's what we are doing so now
all the nails have one code I'm letting
them all dry and then I will apply
another coat and then we will start with
the design so I will be right back so
the two coats are applied it looks
really funky right now I know but we're
going to do our design I'm going to use
the cone at plate in number 6d and it
has like that Burberry or how do you
pronounce it that bur we print and it
has this really cool print and the dots
and flower and that flower but we are
going to is that rare dough print T and
I'm gonna start with the black
holographic nails so I'm gonna take my
conet special nail polish in white and I
already have two cotton pads in here so
this one it's like remove the polish
from the scraper and my stamp and this
one is to s with makeup room makeup and
Lea with a nail polish remover to clean
my plate so let's start off this is
going to be really really fun so I'm
taking the white nail polish and I'm
going to apply this on to that design
that we have going on right dear hope
you can see this so it's on that I take
my scraper and scrape it off
sweep it on the cotton pad and scrape it
again then I take the Stamper and step
on it firmly until it is on the UM
Stamper and then I'm gonna put this on
night
Bill's roll it over and then and he or
put it on and then you have this really
really really really cool design right
there I absolutely love this but and
then clean your plate really well
because um else it won't get on the stem
that well and I'm going to do this to my
black nails oh so that is going to be
really pretty so it's on and then I take
my scraper scrape wipe off scrape wipe
off stamp firmly on the stamp part and
then roll it onto your nails like that
this one went a little bit fill ish but
it doesn't matter it gives a cool effect
so I'm cleaning it again on the UM nail
polish remover pad and the play and then
do it once again more eat more do it
again
so scrape scrape wipe off scrape wipe
off stamp on the plate are on the
Stamper and then roll it over your nails
and this one has that to open like that
cuz a cool effect so this is how it
looks
I'm gonna do my stump thumpy nail and um
yeah so I'm going to do that and then I
will show you how to do the white nail
so
we'll be right back for the ring finger
I'm gonna take my special nail polish
and black this one is really messy but
this one is not opaque enough to get
online nails once on one time so it will
be even more messy your set of word
anyways taking the black polish and then
going over that image just like the
white and then I take my scraper and
scrape it up one scrape it off - why
take my stamp stamp down it is on
Stamper and now apply it well that's up
a bit blob of black and now that is
going on to my nails like that so I get
all the nails and what I like to do is
apply the topcoat before I clean my
cuticles middle right side oh that's I
like that last finger I will show you
middle right side left side I'm going to
take nail polish remover and a q-tip and
now it's soaking wet now you're just
going to clean those edges and it's not
really hard as long as you just won't
touch your design if you're wondering
what went wrong with this nail I
scratched it while I was opening the
window so really stupid but it's my own
fault
so again thanks for watching I hope you
like the nails and if you ever try this
design out post it as a video response
because I really wanted to see what you
came up with so yeah thanks for watching
