guys so today I'm doing a tutorial on
and Natalia Kills kill my boyfriend
music video and not yeah I don't really
have a lot to say today and I just I
hope you liked it and if you want to
know how I did this then please keep on
watching okay so the first thing I'm
doing is applying Mac's
pear Lee Paint Pot on my eyelids do you
prevent the eyeliner from creasing
throughout the day okay then I'm just
gonna take this random makeup studio
palette never gonna take this wipe which
has a really nice sheen to it and then
this cream color and I'm gonna mix the
two and apply those on top of my lid and
just as a wash of color all over the lid
into the crease so just stay a little
bit below it so you still have that
definition and apply that to my brow
bone then all I'm gonna do is highlight
the inner corners of my eyes a bit right
here with these white only okay no it's
eyeliner time now all I'm gonna do is
make a really extreme cat eyeliner
starting from the bottom eyelid and then
I'm gonna make a wing and then go back
in and make it just really thick and all
you got to do then is apply the line
into your crease it's really really easy
for this I'm going to use mac's
blacktrack fluid line which is just a
black gel eyeliner and the brush I'm
using is just a nail art brush that I
use for eyeliner only so no nail
polishes in it
so this is the first eyeliner step that
you make and now from this point right
here you're going to go and make a wing
and it can be quite dramatic
and then go all the way in and make a
really thick
okay so this is the basic shape now just
really make it thick and really urban
if you want to keep it like this that's
totally fine you just ever really think
signature and Tommy appeals eyeliner
because this is how she wear to her
eyeliner normally you want to be careful
with the crease line because it can be
too thick in just a couple movements so
just make sure that you start really
thin and just make it thicker as you go
because if you start really thick and it
is too thick then you're and you
have to fudge and you have to start all
over again and just want to follow your
natural crease direction and then at the
end you're gonna make it parallel to the
eyeliner right there that's all a little
tip is to swirl your brush into the lid
and just swirl it around and then you
get a really fine point to work with
if you feel like you've screwed up just
take a brush like this a nice angle
concealer brush and just take the
conceal that you want I'm gonna use the
mac studio finish concealer in NC 15 and
you can just clean up the lines a bit
just make them a little bit sharper okay
now I'm going to tightline the water
line right here just to make everything
seamless black and no gaps okay what I'm
not gonna do is curl my lashes with my
schumer eyelash curler and that mascara
and this is makeup studio water
resistance Volume Mascara
um it's completely up to you if you want
to apply some false lashes to really
open up the eyes even more I'm not gonna
do it because I saw in the music video
that Natalia wasn't wearing them either
so I'm not gonna do this either either
okay so the main lip with this look was
a really nice soft pinky nude lip for
that you can use two colors this is Riya
several crews who are in number six and
it's a really really nice warm nude
color now that is an option you can mix
that to make it a little bit more pink
like Natalia war this is Viva Glam Gaga
number one and if you make substitutes
oh yeah there you get a really nice soft
nude pinky color but Natalia Kills
actually tweeted me once what her
favorite MAC lipstick color was because
I she was doing a question thing on
Twitter and she actually answered me I
was like oh so special and she told me
that Mac Mirage lipstick was her
favorite lipstick in this world and it's
a really bright bright orange now she's
actually wearing Mirage in a couple of
shots in this music video so if you're
going to go for a really bright lip and
you want to keep it in a Natalia Kills
theme then go for Mirage if you want to
make it a little bit more wearable go
for the two new colors so yeah this
comet just really will make it a little
bit more wearable but I'm gonna have fun
I'm gonna apply the orange lipstick so
yeah that completes this Natalia Kills
kill my boyfriend music video look I
absolutely love Natalia Kills and I
loved those
look so I had to do a tutorial on it I
think you guys so much for watching for
