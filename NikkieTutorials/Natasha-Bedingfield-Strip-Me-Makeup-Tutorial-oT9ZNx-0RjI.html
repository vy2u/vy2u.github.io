music video yesterday I went insane I
mean she were at least six looks loved
the video it's so well if you don't love
this video you're crazy because it has a
long makeup in it I absolutely fell in
love with the look where she looks like
it like this this military warrior girl
with this golden stripes on her face and
blue glittery smokey eyes so that is
what I try to recreate today and yeah I
even tried to match my hair to hers
because she had it like this this is big
if you want to know how to do this
makeup then please keep on watching and
um on tutorial first thing you want to
do is of course apply a base your lid to
prepare your eyes increasing I use my
Michael Todd nude cream eyeshadow the
first thing I'm going to do is I'm going
to grab copper plate by Mac and with a
sigma 220
why is a number of fade off I'm just
gonna grab the copper plate and work
this into my crease and you want to go
all the way in to your nose line
once you have that apply to your crease
I'm gonna take a dark blue color
this is contrast by Mac and with a 217
my Mac I'm gonna go into the color and
this is going to darken the entire look
so first I'm gonna start off in the
outer part of my eye and go into the
crease and go through that outer Z and
then just make that crease darker also
here with that no sign you want to make
some guess depth there not to get the
part above the crease a little bit of
more um um when I grab a sigma 217 and
crystal by Mac and crystals like this
gray color with the blue duochrome
and blended above the contrast and as
you can see that is a really fun purple
Sheen now I want to make that brow bone
even like funnier so I'm gonna make it
like this purple Sheen I'm gonna grab a
bourgeois pigment in Lord God brilliance
elite really it's that one and what I
always liked about that bourgeois
feelings is that like this you get the
cheapest brush you'll never get and like
oh I'm not gonna ply my eyeshadow with
that oh crap
well the trick is there is a lid on the
bottom which you can pull off and it
just fell all over me me really
just me
so I'm gonna grab a 275 by Sigma go into
the pigment work it into the brush oh
please don't drop on me again and put
that on your brow bone and that gives
the most amazing eyes purpley Sheen ever
now I'm going to grab makeup studio
jewel effects in shine which is an
amazing silver pigment and put this onto
your lids and now because I feel like
that is too plain
I'm gonna grab Mac's transparent eel
reflex and put those into the middle
we're just like a blueish teal is
glitter in the middle it is amazing that
makes you have to fall out office later
you can just take tape and take it off
like that now I'm going to grab that
bourgeois p1 again and put that on city
in your corners and blend it in the next
thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna grab a
240 my Sigma and go in contrast and just
smoke this on your bottom lash line now
I'm going to grab copper plate again and
mix that with contrast to smoke it down
now I'm gonna reapply some concealer
under my eyes just to hide those letters
that fell down I'm gonna apply some
mascara which is makeup studio maximum
volume and then the lips which will be
nude
so grip your new lipstick and put that
on and then we will do this artsy fartsy
stuff but he did these two so I'm only
gonna do this one I'm just gonna grab
eyeliner MEK mixing medium and then a
brush like this like that it's just a
concealer brush and first I'm gonna coat
that brush with the mixing medium to
make it nice and flat and then I'm gonna
go into makeup studio SHINee effects
golden light which it looks like that
and then it's just the case ups to
wiping it on your cheek and at first you
won't get a lot of coverage so you're
going to build it up of course you can
go crazy with this step and make lines
go like this and like this let me get an
entire mask but I'm staying true to the
look of the video so I hope you guys
