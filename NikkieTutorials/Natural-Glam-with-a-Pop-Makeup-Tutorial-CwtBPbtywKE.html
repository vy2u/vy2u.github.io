tutorial based on the look that I was
wearing in my January hits and oh god
knows I got so many requests and I
didn't really expect that because well
this look it's it's it's really easy you
will you will laugh at me we're going to
use the Naked 1 palette because with
that video a lot of people someone like
do a video with The Naked palette as
well Here I am doing it oh wait I got to
show you my new sort of hipster worthy
blouse this is my romwe calm and I'm
actually about to film a huge haul with
all this wrong stuff that I bought and
I'm so happy with all of it it's so
hipster chic and I'm like I'm hipster
it's not hipster but it's sort of is if
you like those type of clothes go check
out wrong be calm I absolutely love them
I will put their info in infobox below
as well and other than that let's go
right ahead to the tutorial I love you
guys bye ok guys so it's always the
first thing you want to do is supply
base to your eyelids to prevent the
eyeshadow from creasing and I'm using my
Mac soft ochre Paint Pot and um that's
it okay so in this tutorial the only
eyeshadows I'm going to use our by urban
decay and this is the Naked 1 palette
and I'm going to start off by defining
my lower lash line
with a little bit of buck and then
blending it out with there it is naked
so just go ahead and define your lower
lash line with these two colors
right now I'm taking naked and I'm going
further into my inner corners and I'm
blending this out and then with the
pencil brush blend it out and make it
softer now of course you don't have to
do this I know this isn't like everyday
kind of look but I am one of those girls
who loves more definition under their
lashline because I really feel like that
kind of makes my eyes speak so that's
why I place a darker color underneath my
eyes if you feel like that makes you
look more tired or more unhealthy than
don't do it taking buck again I'm sort
of going to go into my crease in a very
defined C shape and the reason why I'm
going for a C shape is because that just
is a little bit more natural if you kind
of add that V in it kind of looks really
of course makeup is going to look fake
but I feel like when you put like that V
in you kind of look too much and I feel
like with this C you're a little bit
more natural because it kind of hugs the
curves of your eyes so just kind of make
a C there and then go further into your
crease now taking naked only I'm going
to blend that into the inner corners of
my crease and making it softer with a
really big blending brush I'm now going
to use naked only and make this entire
crease softer and more blended and that
will make it look more natural okay now
I'm going to take my leo le face powder
and with this I'm going to highlight my
brow bone I suggest putting a matte
highlighter on your brow bone because if
you put shimmery there the entire
purpose of looking somewhat natural with
this look has been like brushed away for
me I'm going to use my most favorite
color of this entire palette and that is
toasted I seriously love everything
about this color it's just so it's
wearable but it's like it has a kick of
glamour it's so pretty
without even like trying it's
Oh for my inner corners and going back
into my leo le face powder and just
blending that into the inner cordis and
there for an extra bit of shimmer I'm
going to use virgin and that is all you
have to do for eyeshadow it's just
defining your lashline and your crease
and then a shimmery color on the lid and
then some blending and you're done to
finish this I off I'm gonna put some Ben
Nye neutralizer cream crayon in lights
env2 on my waterline and this is a nude
color and this will open up my eyes a
lot I'm not going to use white because I
feel like white in my opinion looks too
fake it kind of looks as if you're thick
because it's too too much so I'm gonna
go for a nude color if you're one of
those people who loves to put like a
dark color on the waterline go ahead and
do it that will make this look a lot
more sultry and then for mascara I'm
going to use my favorite makeup studio
waterproof 3d extra black my mom sells
this in her web shop and they just
separate my lashes I'm gonna use this
Mac mascara right here I don't know the
name but I will put that on my blog but
this is fantastic as well and that's it
okay for cheeks of course the first step
is to contour it because I always do
this and they're going to use my NYX
blush in taupe and yeah i contour every
day because I'm still hoping one day my
skin absorbs the shape and then I will
kind of look skinny
ona Turrell and you know what comes
after that that is warming up my face
with my Illamasqua blush in disobey ooh
that's a little bit too much oh girl
what am i doing to Memphis for blush I'm
gonna put on my most healthiest combo I
can think of when I put these on I just
don't look healthy and I just I kind of
dare I say I kind of look good
so the blushes I use for that are my Mac
launch away and my cereal Rhodes
mineralized skinfinish and then to
further highlight my cheekbones I'm
going to use my favorite NARS albatross
and I'm just gonna put this right here
to give it that amazing gold Sheen and
this will make you look like a million
bucks okay for lipstick discount asks
for so many times and I kind of didn't
get it because as you guys know I always
put like my what I'm wearing on my blog
and I will put a link to my blog in the
info box
NARAS Velvet Matte lip pencil in and
this is I'm gonna butcher this bolero
bolero
I think it's bolero not sure it's B o le
ro bolero lingo okay so I'm gonna put
that on my lips and I'm gonna put that
on my lips
and that guys is how I did my makeup for
the January hits and oh god knows for a
