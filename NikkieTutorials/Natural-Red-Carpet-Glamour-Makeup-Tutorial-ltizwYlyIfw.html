somewhat like natural makeup I've been
getting loads and loads and loads and
loads of the crafts on a neutral makeup
look so yeah I tried to keep it down
today I just worked with a lot of like
shiny eyeshadows umm I applied false
eyelash just to my eyes because um I'm
one of those like losers who doesn't
have like long curly like think about
Tiffany D I had to apply the lashes to
make a look oh so yeah today I try to do
a like glamorous red carpet natural look
and if you want to know how I did this
then please keep on watching first thing
you want to do is apply a base to your
eyelids to prevent the eyeshadow that
you're going to put on from creasing and
creasing is I have it right now
freezing is when that line of concealer
that I have fun you see that creasing is
when that happens to your eyeshadow and
I find it really sad when you put so
much effort and work into a look and you
don't put a base on it like extra two
hours you get that stripe in Europe in
your like crease so if you want to
prevent that um you can use a base and
the one I'm using is the Mac soft ochre
Paint Pot okay so the first a shadow
we're using is this new one from MEK and
it's called a mineral mode and it's from
the new collection called semi or
semi-precious who's gonna get that onto
the brush and just start putting it onto
the inner third of your eye now actually
the first half of your eye I'm gonna get
a medium brown colored eye pencil this
is LMS cos interrogate at first I'm just
making a line as I would do an eyeliner
and feel right there then I'm gonna go
on
my lid now with the brush blend it and
then from that outer point move it a
little bit into your crease
I normally would go all the way in not
going to today just keep it on the outer
corner and a little bit like halfway in
I'm going to take max quark eyeshadow
and just set that liner with it and
while you're at it is blended a bit as
well
okay then I'm going to take a big big
blending brush and I'm going to blend
everything until it's nice and smooth
and just soft I'm doing this because it
will it will like make the quark a less
there which makes it more natural which
makes it more for the people who hate
extreme I'm going to take mystery
eyeshadow from MEK and I feel like
because we're going to apply the lashes
I feel like you need a little bit of
Darkness between the lashes so I'm just
gonna play some of the mystery really
close to my lashes to make the lash band
later run disappear and actually take a
little bit of that mystery and just
darken up that outer V a little bit I'm
gonna go back to mineral mode and
reapply that toodle-loo because I feel
like because of all the brown you kind
of lost all the intensity of it then I'm
gonna blend a little bit of next
corduroy under my lower lashes if you
really like natural natural looks then
skip this step because darker colors
under the eyes make it more dramatic so
if you really want to natural look skip
that take this midnight white shimmering
powder this is called LX 1 eyes
this is amazing at the inner corner
highlight it will totally open up the
eyes you can use Mac for this you have
white frost eyeshadow which is basically
the same that I lost mine just pop that
into the inner corners so I just applied
my favorite nude eyeliner to my
waterline to open up the eye it's even
more and to make them look even natural
learn I'm going to curl the lashes and
the Python Mac hot and naughty mascara
I'm going to use this the like soft size
I'm using are just a Nigel's
blah-blah-blah-blah-blah the Nigel's for
fifteen lashes in black okay fertile is
I'm just gonna use some lip erase and
some Chanel lipstick in a vessel and it
is a Rouge Coco shine I know this may be
really dramatic to some people but just
take some tips and tricks out of this
entire video if you want it to be more
natural skip the lashes skip the color
underneath yeah I want to thank you guys
