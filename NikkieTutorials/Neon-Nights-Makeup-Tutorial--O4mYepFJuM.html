don't panic it's just me on eyeliner
that's all so today I came up with a
look that okay so this is what happened
then this might be a little bit too much
information but here we go
I was sitting on the toilet and I was
going through all my videos in my head
and I was like I need one he on as one
comes up with that at a toilet I got off
the toilet I grep I grabbed a face chart
and I started like trying things out and
this came out of it
now if you want to know how I do face
charts then please go check out this
video right here there is a video on how
I work with face shirts and stuff so if
you want to know how to get this look
then please keep on watching
so as always the first thing you want to
do even with neon colors is apply a base
first year eyelid super fashionable
creasing and da I'm going to use these
soft ochre Paint Pot from Mac now I'm
gonna put some kid and quirk eyeshadow
by Meg in my crease and you mainly want
to focus is on the inner part of the eye
because the rest of the attention has to
go to of course in II on eyeliner to
warm that crease up a bit I'm gonna take
a bit of texture I shadow for Mac and
that is really going on the inner part
this is mixed chem Amil eyeshadow and
then it's gone onto your brow bone and
you're gonna blend it down into the
crease color to give them a nice blend
I'm gonna take a bit of NYX jumbo pencil
in milk and that is going on the lid for
now and then of course Bullen it out I'm
gonna take this beautiful cool pink
shine pigment from obsessive compulsive
cosmetics and this is called datura that
is going over that my ex face and milk
that jumbo pencil onto the lid in case
you see that gorgeous reflection it has
packed that all over the lid I'm gonna
take another OCC pigment called Obi Ron
go ahead and apply that to your brow
bone and again look at that shine I'm
gonna take my NYX jumbo pencil in milk
again and sort of map out where I want
my neon pink eyeliner to be because I
will be using an eyeshadow and this
eyeshadow is known for not really going
on opaque without a base underneath so
I'm just gonna put a base underneath to
really make it stick and I'm gonna blend
it out slightly
the neon pink I'm gonna use is from the
sleek acid palette all you want to do is
really pack on this color because this
color is really powdery
as really powdery and without a base it
will really stick Plus show so just make
sure that you are packing this on you're
gonna get fallout like that so make
sure you don't apply your foundation for
your eyes I'm gonna go to the inner
parts of my eye and then go back and
they will get that sort of shape which I
really love so what I'm gonna do is just
make sure that I like the shape of the
eyeliner and just adding parts where I'm
missing out or thickening parts where I
feel like the eyeliner is too small for
the neon yellow I'm using my sleek asset
palette again and that is going right
here on the very inner corner above the
eyeliner we just created
slowly but surely blend it out and into
your lid increase and it's okay to
really pack on that yellow because again
with this acid pellet the more you pack
it on the more it shows so I'm really
gonna pack that on I'm gonna go back in
to mix Kirke eyeshadow and that is going
on the bottom lid with that gap that
hasn't got any pink on it yet blend the
pink more to my lower lash line as well
to blend it with quark for my waterline
and then he is then night neutralizer
Crean crayon in light and p2 then I'm
now gonna do is apply a black winged
eyeliner and I'm just doing that to give
the eye more depth and also to hide the
eyelashes a bit more we all know how to
do black liner by now if not check my
cash every hour Lana Del Rey and I'm
gonna apply some lashes and the lash
I will be using our red cherry number 76
so I'm gonna do all of that right now
and then I will be back for the face
now of course my face I still have to do
my foundation as if you couldn't tell
for my foundation and using Mac's face
and buddy white and I'm going to mix
that with my favorite Neutrogena Healthy
Skin Foundation in number ten classic
ivory I'm gonna apply that as a
foundation and as a concealer mix Pro
Longwear
in NC 15 this is my favorite concealer
first I'm going to take max sculpts
powder and I'm going to contour with
that and kind of blend that into the
temples as well for blush I'm going to
use tarts over exposed Amazonian 12-hour
clay blush for a highlight I'm going to
use Mac's whisper of guilt extra
dimension skin finish because I have
obsessed with that eye if I die I want
this in my grave and just kind of
highlight your highlighting points of
your face
I'm gonna wear a nude color with this
because I love new coloreds and for that
I will be using mixed strawberry milk
which is a really nice soft milky color
and yeah guys that completes the what I
like to call my neon nights I'm inspired
look I dig this I love this
