you how to get these ombre gradient
nails for summer and these are
absolutely so much fun they are bright
as hell in real life it's all using the
young colors um and I absolutely love
this it reminds me of Ke$ha without
glitter so yeah if you want to know how
to get this really fun ombre gradient
bright summery nails then please keep on
watching first thing I'm going to do is
to apply a base to all the nails before
applying any of the colors now I'm going
to take a really nice light skin tone
colored nail polish and I'm going to put
that as a light base color underneath
all the bright colors to really make the
bright neon and the bright pink of the
bright purple pop on top you can
definitely apply a white to make them
pop even more but I think white is too
harsh so I'm going to go for a light
nude tone color and I'm just going to
apply two coats of that on each new
okay would you now want to do is grab a
bowl of water and a sponge like that and
what we're going to do is wet the sponge
by putting it into the water it's let it
soak in for a bit and then grab a towel
and dry it off just a bit so just the
inside of the sponge is still wet so
what you want to do is choose which
colors you want on your nails and then
just put them on the sponge it's really
easy you just put them in the order you
want them on your nails and then all you
do is just sponge it onto your nails and
do that twice all you want to do is go
on to your nails so as you can see it
starts up really really light but with
the second or third coat it gets more
opaque do you see how much better that
is I love it so much
yay it's all opaque now of course you
wouldn't let this be like it is right
now because that was a hot mess you're
gonna get some q-tips and some nail
polish remover and just clean up the
edges so just grab your nail polish
remover and a q-tip and start wiping all
the junk away there we go okay and after
cleaning up all you want to do is apply
your favorite fast drying top coat I'm
gonna apply my favorite one right now
and don't be afraid if it smudges a bit
because that only adds on to the look I
am loving this nail polish style so and
it's that easy um I think the hardest
part is to get your cuticles clean and
fresh again because sometimes the purple
can really go into the edges but that
will like go in on itself in about two
days um so yeah that is how you do the
gradient ombre nails first summer I
absolutely love this I feel so colorful
I feel so bright think again so much for
watching and hopefully I will see you
guys next month bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
