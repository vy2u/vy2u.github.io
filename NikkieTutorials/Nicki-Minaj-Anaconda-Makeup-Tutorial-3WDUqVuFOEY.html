an inspired tutorial on nicki minaj's
new music video anaconda oh my god look
at her blush the first time I heard
anaconda I was so shocked because first
I thought Nicki was just joking around
with the ha ha ha yeah and I was just
like what is happening over here
but it was it got to listen to it more a
couple of times I just fell in love this
song it's so damn addictive like it
stays in your head the entire week and
Nicki looks absolutely stunning in the
video I mean she just got a whole lot of
ass but goddamn she looks good and
what's even more fun it said I have
gotten so many requests to do this look
so I thought today will be the perfect
day to show you guys how to get the
Nicki Minaj anaconda look and um yeah
that a further adieu if I know how to
get the Etta Konda look then please stay
tuned for priming today I'm going to go
with one of my favorite combos that is
my Mac prep and prime natural radiance
in radiant yellow mixed with a little
bit of Becca shimmering skin Perfector
in opal so these two together are going
right on my face and you definitely want
to add in some sort of shimmer glow
product to the face because Nicki looked
super super glowing and radiant and sexy
delicious so you definitely want to add
that glow to your face then now it's
time for a foundation and I wanted to
try something new because this just came
in the mail this is by Rimmel London
this is the lasting finish 25 hour SPF
20 skin perfecting full coverage
foundation this is number 200 in soft
beige and because this is way too warm
for my face and this is their lightest
shade I'm going to mix it with Mac's
face and body in white to lighten this
down and then I'm just going to put some
of that
mixture onto my face taking my flat
kabuki brush by Sigma the SAT I'm just
gonna work this in and then as usual for
concealer I'm gonna go with my Mac Pro
Longwear cuz it's the
and because joycie Benelli which is also
the makeup artists for the Kardashians a
lot of times did Nicki Minaj's makeup I
believe so because she's done Nicki's
makeup a lot of times recently some kind
of figured that she did it she's known
for the triangle highlighting so I was
like let's do that today because I
normally don't really do that and I kind
of wanted today so BAM hashtag what does
natural mean hashtag back to school
makeup and all so let's do a little bit
of nose highlighting here cuz that's
what happened
on Nikki's face and I liked it okay now
I'm going to buff that in using my f-86
bath Sigma cuz I love it I recently got
this comment from a guy on my channel he
was like do you sleep at night for
deceiving men like this by putting on
all that makeup and I just flat-out
laughed for 10 minutes aren't I got
another one that's why you take her
swimming on the first date it's a good
one it's a really good one I'll give you
ten for that then I'm just going to set
my under eye area with my favorite
powder this one is by Chanel and it's
the natural is finish in number 20
Claire and I'm going to go ahead and do
my brows and one eye off-camera and then
it will be back okay the first thing
I'll be doing is a
nobody's to my eyelids do you prevent
this entire creation from creasing and
I'm using my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot in
got to have a soft ochre for this the
first eyeshadow going to be working with
is kid by Mac and I'm just taking that
color and placing it in my crease as my
transition shade so this is to blend out
that crease color easier later on and
then at the side here you kind of want
to swoop it out to give it a nice winged
shape and then go back in and diffuse
the edges then I'm going in with Mac's
mystery eyeshadow and really lightly I'm
going to start defining that crease even
more and quite precise as well so you
want to add that mystery in kind of a
more precise and concentrated manner and
then also when you get to that side here
you want to swoop it out to give that
nice wing not too much you'll go too far
with it and I'm really lightly diffuse
the edges but you really want to have
that you know concentration with mystery
in the crease and then you can always go
back in with a little bit of kid and
make the blend between those two even
softer and nicer just make it a really
nice concentrated and diffused crease
now for the other than going with this
amazing new Sigma pigment this is called
loose shimmer in mid-summer and I'm
picking some of that up with my finger
and patting it on to the lid area
meeting up with a dark brown color in
the crease and you want it from inner
corner to outer corner and I just oh my
god I love this color so damn much then
going in with another Sigma loose
shimmer pigment this is called a gilded
and this one is going right in the
middle
again up to the crease and then blend
the edges to the sides and we're doing
this because Nikki had this stunning a
glowing gold lid and it just the gold
looked like it was glowing and the only
technique you have for that to make
something glow is by darkening the outer
edges and you know glowing and making a
lighter of the center so that's what I'm
doing with these pigments for the
eyeliner I first really want to have
that strong line where I want my
eyeliner to go to so for that I'm taking
this Real Techniques silicone liner
brush and a little bit of my Sigma gel
eyeliner and wicked and with this I can
really determine where I want the start
line of my winged liner to go to and
also from there you can drag it back on
toward the lashes and now I move over to
my Catrice liquid liner in dating to
black to do the rest of the eyeliner
work
I'm now popping a little bit of
concealer on the inner portion of my
eyes to really highlight it and make it
clean and crisp and an over top of that
I'm applying a little bit of the bombs
and mary-lou manizer to finish off the
eyes it's time for mascara and for that
I'll be using my waterproof 3d extra
black mascara by makeup studio combined
with a little bit of a Holika Holika
magic pull mascara and four lashes the
Mac 36 for the cheeks and Nikki had this
amazing warm bronzy glow going on her
and I just absolutely love that it's so
sultry and glowing and glam and just
beautiful so I'm going to go with a
mixture of products to get there to get
to that destination I first go to carve
out my cheeks a little bit with my
illamasqua eyeshadow in heroine
then to further warm up my face I'm
going to go with a bronzer this is one
of my favorites this is a refined golden
by Mac I'm just going to go on my
forehead and kind of follow the entire
hairline area so we leave like a nice
little spot of brightness in the middle
drag queens call that the beige rainbow
and then also with that I'm going to hit
the high points of my cheekbones and
blend that contour out a little bit more
okay then just start working on the
beautiful glow I'm first going to add
some glow with warmth this is stereo
rose mineralized skinfinish by Mac and
it's really warm and intense and it
actually distributes a little bit of
color and this is actually amazing for
medium to dark skin people girls boys
everyone and swoosh it on my cheeks so
sort of from that entire bronzer thing
we did this comes out on the cheeks it
just it gives it a really nice warmth
but because it's a mineralized
skinfinish it also gives amazing shine
like it makes you look like plastic for
highlighter I'm going to go with Becca
shimmering skin Perfector pressed in
moonstone because it's nice light and
golden so it's going to give you that
exact same perfect glow as Nikki head I
feel like I keep talking about myself
okay you take a little bit on a brush
place it on the highest points of your
cheeks which is about right on the sides
of your eyes and you want to build it up
a little so I'm going to take more and
build it up then wipe my brush off and
I'm going to blend the edges out so the
main impact of highlight is going to be
here because you pack it on here and
then you blend it out softly and then
your left
wait let me let a little bit more of the
blush in and then you're left with this
high shine glow which is
Klee what Nikki was wearing and lastly
what I'm going to do is to really give
myself that glow juhi glow I'm going to
go with my NYX juhi finish a
long-lasting setting spray for some
shake it's okay and then just spritz
free lips you want to go very glossy and
nude with a punch of pink so for that
I'm first going to take my NYX lip
pencil in natural with them everything
but today for lips I'm using Mac's a
lipstick in angel and then for glass I'm
going to go with my NYX butter gloss in
Maple blondie and that guys concludes my
