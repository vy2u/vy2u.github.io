Nicki Minaj is a Super Bass music video
she had I'm doing the one in the first
look well if you couldn't figure that
out already I absolutely loved the song
love the music video I never really got
around on doing it and still right now I
get a request to do with every single
day so today I decided to do it yes I
went back to my old camera I absolutely
loved how the quality was of that last
one but it was a pain in my mother
effing butthole
so um today I'm going to do this Nicki
Minaj a Super Bass look I kind of look
like a bimbo but that doesn't matter so
let's go on to the tutorial now I love
you yes I do it was super base so of
course you want to play base to your
eyelids to pretend that I should've of
creasing and the one I'm using is my Mac
soft ochre Paint Pot so the first
eyeshadow I'm going to use is sugar
pills butter cupcake and she had a sheen
on top of it so for that I'm going to
take my Ben Nye grande color pellet and
this is Sun yellow if I am correct so
I'm just going to mix those two together
and apply those two colors to my lids
you just want to go a little bit above
your crease with this okay now I'm just
kind of take a blending brush like that
and just soften the edges okay I'm going
to take a color that is somewhat deeper
than your own skin color now you can
keep it like this but personally for me
this is a little bit too bold
like I feel naked right now I'm going to
take this makeup studio pillow that I
have and I'm going to take this color
right here I have absolutely no idea
what name it is but I will write it down
on my website you can see toriel's calm
I will have a full list with every
product use right there and just take a
really teeny tiny bit and just darken
the crease up with it just a teeny tiny
bit just a little this is way too much
so you're going to blend that out and my
dogs are barking I'm so sorry for that
not for the bottom I'm going to take
this on Nick's or NYX or however the
hell you want to pronounce it milk I
shadow base and soul thingy jumbo and
I'm just going to put that on my bottom
lash line and then I'm going to take my
finger and blend that out and the reason
why I'm doing this is because whatever
you put on white is going to pop and I'm
going to take another color from the
makeup studio a pillow that I have it is
this one right here again I don't know
the number I will write it down on my
website and I'm just going to put the
color on the entire lower lash line
so once you've got that done you're
going to apply a eyeliner to your
chocolate like Casey with all those
lashes they're um I'm going to use in
block eyeliner gel net for this this is
my favorite eyeliner my gel eyeliner
and I'm just going to put a really tiny
wing at the end okay now I'm going to
apply some mascara and curl my lashes
this is my Japan s eyelash curler and
the mascara I'm going to use is makeup
studios maximum volume and then pop some
lashes on I'm going to use Mac's number
three and that are to number three on
top of each other
and I just thought that glue dry clear
until it's just gone until you won't see
it anymore and if you want you can add
another layer of gel eyeliner to it to
make sure you don't see any glue
okay so free lips Nicki Minaj had two
colors she had a baby bright pink on and
a bright full-on fuchsia pink um the one
I am going to do is the baby pink one so
to get the perfect baby pink color I'm
going to take this lipstick right here
this is from Barry M and it is called
number 100 which is the perfect baby
pink and then to give it just a little
like brighter feeling I'm going to take
a number 52 from Barry M as well
so here guys that completes this and you
can menage a Super Bass a makeup
tutorial of her first look and I
absolutely love this I do feel sort of
like a bimbo right now but that's okay
so you guys thank you guys so much for
watching for a fullness of all products
use and the numbers of the makeup studio
ashes that I didn't know go to my
website you can see tutorials calm um I
love you thank you for watching and um
yeah you know I really got a thing for
American guys sigh okay guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
