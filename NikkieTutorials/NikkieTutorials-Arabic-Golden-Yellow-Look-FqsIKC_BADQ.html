this golden yellow slash cut crease mu
look I hope you like it and if you want
to know how I did this keep on watching
to start this a Rebeck look up you're
going to put on your primer I use
Beijing shades thick right now we're
going to take a fluffy big brush and
take some gesso and get that on the
brush and what you're going to do is
sweep it on your eye the entire eye and
what this will do is make the whole look
easy to blend and make that align that
we've got here easy to blend - okay now
the hard part is coming cutting the
crease okay I'm going to take a really
creamy eyeliner which is gosh truly
brown I'm going to take a brown pencil
do this take that pencil and look
straight in your mirror you see no do
not do this or this or this
just straight open up your eyes a bit
and start see I kind of talk and start
making that line
this is the hardest part
look at
take a q-tip um go to little bit if it
goes wrong just take a q-tip and work
okay not a hardest part
then go a little bit closer
like that now take a really small brush
and start blending that line now take
your essence of beauty crease brush the
bear size one and spiced chocolate just
take a little teeny bit and start at
that line packing the car on the line
like that we have this take the smaller
one you want spiced chocolate and go
over that line as well a little bit
then let's start blending it out and up
and all that good stuff
take the bigger one blend it a bit
- cute
take some more Brown blend upwards
now take some golden lemon pigment I
love this color
you can see that and go in that car with
a really really teeny brush get in that
what let's start packing this to the
first half of the lip and of course stay
under that line now we just create it
because that is going to be the artsy
thingy
in this look so keep that line alone
just like that and with that same really
small brush take whittling go in that
color start applying it to the remaining
space of that part and blend this with
the golden lemon just like this go over
it then work that brush off and take
some more golden lemon reapply that make
it nice and Fryman it again take the
sign akashic blending brush and go in
this color from the neutral palette bump
Coastal Scents in that color and take it
really lightly and start blending the
above that line once you've done that go
back and spiced chocolate with the
essence of beauty crease brush and that
line
make it dark again okay and then take
the smaller sized one and go in beauty
marked by Mac and just really really
really what we take that color on the
brush and trace the line of the pencil
just trace it to nothing more than that
and when you've traced that go blend
upwards to blend it with that brown
really simple then with that same brush
go and splice chocolate again and blend
that one up then take that sign Kesha
brush the blending brush and blend it
all out now take some nylon with that
scientist a brush wipe it off go in that
nylon this is nylon you know it and the
inner choirs there is where you're going
to apply it but not only at the inner
corners but with an angle brush this one
go in it we start applying it as your
brow bone
I love then with that sunny crusher
blending brush go back in that palette
but not taking this one I take this one
this color right there take it lightly
on the brush and blend it between nylon
and the line essence a Beauty big brush
go back in beauty marked just a little
tiny bit and not too much then start
reapplying it in the line blending it
upwards again that's it for the upper
lid whew it was a lot of work wasn't it
okay take that brown pencil again my
gosh and swoop it on the lower lip and
then take um the is a beauty small brush
and going spiced chocolate and trace
that line
then take some nylon with that same
brush wipe it up and put it up to the
inner corners then take some wood wings
and apply it to the middle make a thin
line that put on some mascara or falsies
I'm not that good in fall see so I get
mascara and then will be big to tell you
how to finish off this look so lovely
youtubers that was it on my lips I
applied some concealer just to make my
lips look disappearing and on top of
that I added some essence lip gloss in
number six toffee which will give you
that nice golden look so I hope you like
it um it's definitely my favorite to try
that I've done it's really artsy but
still wear a saree wearable for going
out and I really love it so I hope you
liked it if you have any questions leave
