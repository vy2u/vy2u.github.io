look it's kind of a rabbit inspired not
really because I'm not wearing the big
heavy black liner so that makes it less
Rebeck but I really love this look it's
the cockpits look with some baggy green
color on the lid and some with little
rhinestones I hope you like it and if
you want to know how I did this please
keep on watching
so to start this look off you are going
to apply a base and today I use two i
use the miss helen eyeshadow base it's
my favorite and then I use the NYX or
NYX I don't know how to pronounce it I
will just say my ex because I like it
better when I use the NYX jumbo
eyeshadow pencil in milk and I just
applied a little teeny bit to make it a
bit more lighter for the colors
what today I'm going to do is take a big
shader brush and go in the two-faced
bitch by Jessie and go in that lighter
color and this is going to be packed all
over the lid brow bone everything
because you're going to cut that crease
and if you want to cut that crease you
want to apply a shadow under everything
so you can like um remove parts that
went wrong and all that good stuff so
just apply that everywhere so it's nice
and smooth
okay what I'm now going to do is cut my
crease with the gosh
um truly brown eye pencil and I am NOT
going to talk because I will mess it up
so again like in all the concrete's
videos I'm going to speed it up a little
bit and then I will be back
now take that brown color of the
two-faced bitch palette and with a small
pencil brush you're just going to follow
the line with the eyeshadow go all the
way in and when you come to that inner
point you're going to make like a
slanted eye shadow line just like that
so it really goes in that point if you
know what I mean this trace trace twig
trace that line then go blend it out put
it out
then take that bigger one and go in that
color and now you're going to blend it
out even more
go in
then blend it out then you're going to
take the Sonia Kashuk blending brush and
first you're going to blend out those
edges then you take a little bit more
and blend it out but extending it more
up I'm sorry I keep looking at myself
I'm sorry that now we're going to do the
lid fergal that you want to take a Max
chartreuse pigment
it's a beautiful pigment really shimmery
and I take that on a 239 brush and I'm
going to Pat this all over the entire
space that is still that whitish color
and I don't know if you noticed but this
is way more green than that one and
that's because I edit nylon by Mac on
this eye so I'm going to take some nylon
and I'm just going to Pat that on top of
that chartreuse color and what you will
get is this nice beijing color with like
green flecks showing through it's really
cool I really like that then go back
into a dark brown color with the small
pencil brush and retrace that line you
made like that and take that bigger one
and make it darker even more and then
that's my magic wand I will end it all
out again same routine same steps now
for the highlight you're going to take
the light color of the two-faced bitch
again and you're
to Pat this onto the brow bone and
blending it down with the brown and just
blend it with that Brown it doesn't have
to be perfect but you do want to blend
it with a brown because this will make
it even more blended take that scientist
your brush again and go in that Brown
follow that line and blend it with the
highlight color this will make that nice
gradient effect now for the lower lip
sweeps on a truly brown pencil under
your lower lid then blend it out then
take that brown color and trace it and
go more in okay then take some
chartreuse pigment oh we did it do on it
inner corner Church fit well church bell
then take some nylon and go on top of it
so anyways that's it for the shadows now
I'm going to line my upper lid with the
L'Oreal super liner carbon gloss then I
will at my mascara the Max Factor false
lash effect and then I will at my lip
gloss
I already of them but I
let you know what I'm wearing on my lips
so be right back okay so I added my
mascara and all that good stuff
and two little rhinestones they are so
pretty so this is my arabic sort of look
idea for you guys today
umm like my fake hair it's fake as hell
um also I wanted to show you what I wear
on my lips I'm wearing Mac's
Miss a lipstick again it's still broken
but I have many one but I'm going to
finish this one first the Miss lipstick
by Mac and then this gosh light and
shine lip glaze and number six and
number six soft brown in you guys this
is the most beautiful brown gold color
ever and look at it it has lights look
at that baby huh they go well with my
makeup like oh look at me look at me
wearing trees over things I don't want
to sing in but look at that it's amazing
and it's a super gorgeous gloss I love
it I'm so that's the lip gloss I'm
wearing on top of it and that's it you
like it and thanks for watching please
