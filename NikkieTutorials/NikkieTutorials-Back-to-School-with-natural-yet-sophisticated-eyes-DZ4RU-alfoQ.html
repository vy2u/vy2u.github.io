back-to-school look for y'all and I'm
really excited about this look because I
always wear this to school not always
because I like to experiment with stuff
in the morning but this is most of the
time I fall back look if I don't know
what to do
and this look really opens up my eyes
and I'm going to show you how to do it
um I think I'm going to do some more
looks for you guys but this is number
one and I hope you like it so keep on
watching
okay you back to school people before we
start with a look you need to apply a
primer if you don't apply a primer to
your lids your eyeshadows going to
crease and you're going to get that ugly
line in your eyeshadow not pretty so
take a eyes shadow base for your I chose
I use a Miss Heaven I show the base it's
only available in vanilla but you have
you DPP you have L'Oreal decreased you
have um Too Faced shadow insurance there
are a lot of things on the market but
make sure you prime your lids the next
thing what I like to do is take a white
creamy pencil and I'm going to put that
onto my lid a little bit into the crease
and then I'm going to blend it out with
a brush and what this is going to do is
make that color on my lid pop so I'm
just blending that out with a brush and
feed it into the crease now I'm going to
take these Sigma SS 224 brush and this
brush is great for working in your
crease and i'm going to take my Coastal
Scents 28 neutral palette I'm going to
take that color right there where my
finger is at that color and I'm going to
take some on the brush and I'm just
going to work it into the crease and up
to my brow bone and this is a great
blending color so put that in your
crease
the next step is to take these Sigma 239
brush and this brush is great for
working in the crease as well and going
back in the palette and I'm taking that
chocolate brown right there and I love
that color you taking that on the tip of
the brush and then you're going to place
a line in your crease just place a line
and then start working it into the
crease to get a nice gradient effect and
once it's completely on there and you
feel like now blending with this brush
anymore
you just take that 224 brush and blend
it into that other color and then you
can always go back in that color and
deepen it out for a highlight on my brow
bone I'd like to take this color right
there I love that color my favorite
color of this entire palette is that
color um if you have any Mac
recommendations for me let me know
because I really love that color and I
wiped that 239 brush by Sigma off and go
in that um highlight color that is going
on your brow bone and then blend it down
a bit and I don't really want to do the
entire highlight with this brush so I'm
going to take a Mac 252 brush go back in
that color and apply more okay now it's
the time to reapply all the colors from
the crease so I'm going to take the 224
brush again and in the blending color
right here that we use as our first step
and I'm just reapply that color so right
now you're just going to reapply all the
colors that we just did now for our lid
color I'm actually going to use the same
I like color which is that one and I'm
just going to take it on that 239 brush
again just wipe it off every time I'm
going to Pat that on to the lid just Pat
it on and I love that light color on the
lid because it really opens up the eyes
now I'm taking some and putting that on
the inner corner as well now for the
lower lid I like to take that chocolate
brown once again and I'm taking the
Sigma SS 219 and I'm taking that and I'm
going to sweep that two-thirds of the
way in I'm always making this stupid
face I know
now I'm taking that NYX jumbo pencil in
milk again and I'm just putting some on
the inner corner of my eye just a little
bit and then I'm brushing that out with
my ring finger heading and then I'm
wiping the 219 brush up again and then
I'm taking the highlight colors and that
is going on my inner corner and this
will open up the eyes tremendously oh my
god now for a little teeny bit of
shimmer on the lower lid I'm going to
take maximum nylon and just with that
same brush and just put it right there
just a bit I don't like on me so
that is the only place where I put
chamber now it is time for a liner liner
is essentially in this look I love my
black liner with looks like this so I'm
going to take this black truck flu with
one of my Mac you can use a liquid liner
you can use a pencil but make sure to
set that pens with shadow or else it's
going to fade away really quickly but
I'm getting my
brush and here it is and I'm taking a
angled brush like a bent brush by Sonia
Kashuk and I'm actually going to show
you how I'm line so I have some on my
brush and I will start in the middle and
go out and then stop around there and
then I go in
like that and I'm taking some more and
I'm going to wing it out
just wing it out
like that and that is how i line my eyes
okay that was a frickin liner now you're
going to apply some mascara I think
every girl or boy loves to wear mascara
to school and I'm going to use my Max
Factor false lash effect make sure your
you curl your lashes before and you
might do it after if you like that and
then you're going to apply some white
eyeliner to your waterline and this will
open up the eyes even more so I'm going
to do all of that right now and then I'm
going to tell you what you can wear on
your lips so be right back okay I'm
finished with my eyes and um what you
can wear on your lips is you can put
everything with this combo you can wear
red lips brightest pink lips
but for school I like to keep it neutral
but yet sexy and I really like this um
baby pinkish pink ish color and um I use
Mac's color crusted lipstick and I love
this color it's my favorite lipstick
ever and on top of that I edit my new
light and shine lip glaze my gosh and
this is a bubblegum pink and yes this
one also has flies and I really like it
because this is a bubblegum pink so that
is what is on my lips really sweet and
really neutral and for blush you can use
a lot I just use my gosh
um blush in number 39 electric pink but
it's not electric at all I'm hitting pan
but it's just a really neutral blush so
um that is basically what you can do for
school I really love this look I wear it
a lot to school and um yeah that's
basically it if you want to notch it up
a bit with glitter take some gold
glitter and line it above the black and
you have nice disco eyes this look is
very first towel and I really like it so
I hope you liked it too
