a month I guess I did a tutorial again
you know big shocker right but um it's
been a long time and I really want to
apologize for not doing any tutorials
lately but it has been so busy in my
life I had a lot of things to do and
every time I wanted to do a tutorial it
illed because if you take a look at my
video a couple of reasons to not upload
today's tutorial if you watch that video
it will be totally clear what I don't
but I didn't sorry about English why I
didn't post that tutorial so check that
video out but first watch this video if
you want to know how I did this look so
keep on watching
so first I applied my base the Miss
Helen eyeshadow base when I really loved
and then to make the application of the
line really smooth I did some gesso and
I put that on the entire eye lid brow
bone everything so it's nice and smooth
so now I'm going to take gosh I'm truly
brown eye pencil and it's that really
smooth brown eye pencil and we're going
to make that line I'm not going to talk
while I'm doing it because then I will
mess up so I'm going to give it a little
bit of a speed this part and then when
I'm back the line is complete
so now that we have our line I'm going
to take the 28 or 24 neutral pelvic
Coastal Scents I'm going to take what I
have correct
and I chose oh I'm really scared and I'm
going to take that color to color next
into black it's really pretty brown and
with a small essence of beauty crease
brush I'm going to follow that line with
that brown color and just follow that
line that and go all the way in like
that and make it somewhat darker
like that
now you're going to take the bigger one
and go in that sing round and we're
going to blend it with just a little bit
brown on top of it so blend it up just
blend it blend blend blend blend blend
make it one darker are two that they are
going to take the Sonia Kashuk blending
brush start blending those edges and
then with the tip of the bristles of
that brush take some of the brown and
apply it at that line as well and take
it up a little bit more like that now
I'm going to let that um crease line
rest for a bit and we're going to take
this Glen Couture blue sky it's pretty
pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty
pretty and with a let me find it small
shader brush you're going in that color
like that
you're starting to Pat this onto the
inner
lid put it on to really bright and crazy
color and I love it and take it down a
bit into your teared up think that leave
it like that and Pat some more into the
lip and go more in now with the same
brush should go in Fiji by Glen Couture
go in the color and Pat this on to the
remaining space of the lid now we're
going to take the 24 appellate again and
we're going in that color that color
right there so I'm going in there color
with the Sonia Kashuk brush and blend it
above that darker brown in the crease
now you take that bigger sized crease
brush and go in that darker bride again
the first row we've used and we're going
back on that line to make it darker
again
then we're taking the smaller one and
we're going into black up the pallet and
we're foing that line again so that's a
little bit darker and smokey they'll go
all the way in just a bit and then we'll
take the bigger one and go a little bit
in the black and blue get take that
Sonia Kashuk blending brush and blend it
all out that take your 252 brush by Mac
and go in this color right right here

close to max vanilla so go in that color
and Pat that onto the eyebrow bone de
Bravo I'm sorry the brow bone is your
highlight and blend down all those other
colors like that then go back in that
lighter brown reviews and go on top of
that am I going too dark around a bit
darker again like that now we're going
to repeat the link colors again and then
it will be back for the lower lash line

brush and going that darker Brown and
