my last video I've missed you guys so
much and it's going to be another week
because my mom is taking the camera with
her on holiday so I know Cara and I
cannot do it but um this is a nice cool
clothing look with um like a light liner
on the smoky I love this I can wear this
out all the day actually I'm going to
work with this which is probably a
little bit too much but I love it
anyways and if you want to know how I
did this look then please keep on
watching
okay to start to flick off you're going
to apply a base to your lids I'm using
my Miss Helen eyeshadow base as always
and the first color we are going to use
for the lid is max sketch and I want to
see a sank X pocket Alicia so much for
making these making me buy this because
I love love it so I'm taking that on a
239 my Mac and I'm going to Pat that on
to my lid and when you go in don't make
it like a big blob but let it going like
slanted so apply the color on your lid
and going into your crease just a little
teeny bit
now I'd like to take just a big fluffy
brush this is the Sigma treble K 224 I'm
just blending out those edges
nothing hard like that and now I'm going
to take the 224 normal size brush by
Sigma link is in a slide bar if you are
interested in these brushes because I
love them and I'm gonna take one of my
all-time favorites max eyeshadows
woodwind so I'm taking that on the brush
and you don't need a low because this is
a belet's pearl and these are pigmented
as hell especially in the outwit wing so
that is going into my crease and I
really love this color combo like they
match perfectly so I'm just applying
that into my crease in my base oh my god
so I'm just applying that and then blend
it out as you go up
now I'd like to reapply that sketch
color and what I like to do is now smoke
it more up into the crease so I'm taking
my son Akashic blending brush one of my
favorites as well and now I'm going in
the crease with sketch to darken it out
in that crease
like that
now I'm going to do my highlight and my
highlight it's from the Coastal Scents a
t28 palette and that color right there
you know that one you know it's my
favorite out of the entire palette and
I'm using a 252 by Mac I'm going into
that color and this is going on to my
brow bone and make the shape work so
right there as well and then blend that
wood wing down a bit just a bit to make
that gradient effect in the corners then
I like to go under my eye as well
now you're going back in that wind and
really apply that color just like always
reapply the cars that you did so now
find the sketch see my lid and in the
crease as well just with it this brush
just quick like that come on now pretty
lower lid I'm going to take these Sigma
219 brush I love this one I'm going in
sketch and this is going to thirds of
the way into my lower lid I'm trying to
work on my face when I do this because
it's horrible well I cannot do it I have
to put my face like this
smoked it down now wet the brush up
really really well and then go in wing
and just on a tip and then put it really
carefully in the middle
like that then weather brush up even
more and take some my eggs milk jumbo
pencil and just a little bit on the
inner corners just like that and then
you blend it out with your finger cut it
out and I'm taking the highlight color
from the brow bone again out of the 28
neutral palette then it's going on my
inner corners and here to open up my
eyes and what I'm now going to do for
some shimmer on the inner corner is
taking max nylon same brush and put it
just on the lower lid not here but here
for some shimmer okay now for the last
step of this look that was quick huh um
I was looking at my desk I'm going to
take max liquid liner in molten soul I
love this I love the max liquid last
liners I love to do smoky eyes and then
do a pop of unusual liner there I love
it so I'm gonna belong my upper lip with
this then I'm going to apply some
mascara which is an X Factor false lash
effect and then I will be back to tell
you what is all my greasy lips right now
and yeah so I will see you in around one
second so Mac SS and um on my lips I
apply some concealer and then gosh 1:30
for lipstick which is my second already
and it's already almost gone and for a
lipgloss steal light and shine number
four my gosh you know with glides Kinsey
then probably not but that is my lip
gloss um that is basically if
look I can workout and go to a club and
get fierce and sexy and I love this look
and I am Lulu and I hope you liked it
and thanks for watching guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
