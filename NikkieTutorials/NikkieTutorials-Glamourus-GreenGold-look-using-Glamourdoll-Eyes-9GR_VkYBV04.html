look mostly using glamour doll eyes
cosmetics Vanessa
the owner gave me an opportunity to use
some of her products so yeah that's what
I did I'm gonna use some colors and I
hope you like it so if you want to know
how I did this look don't go anywhere
just watch it okay so yeah
okay so the first thing you want to do
is apply a base to your eyelids to
protect your eyes from creasing and I
use the Miss Helen eyeshadow base and on
top of that some NYX jumbo pencil in
milk
okay to start up you're going to take
some corduroy by Mac and this is to
create like a shape so start over here
and make like a new crease line it's a
bit of creasing but without the
pencil so go in and eventually you won't
see this anymore because you don't see
it there or so and then blend it out
then take a 217 my Mac and make it
darker now you're going to take the CVS
on crease brush I'm gonna take the small
one and go in any black matte color you
own and you're going to make that line
darker and make it in like a point and
then blend it in make sure to blend it
then take your Sonia Kashuk blending
brush blend it out a bit let me plan
diamond take some more with the bigger
one make it darker keep that point you
really want to keep that point like that
I'll end it up again now you're going to
take the first color of glamour doll
eyes I'm going to use and this is the
Sham rock and this is such a pretty
color I seriously love this color so
you're going to take them on a 239
minute Mac and pack that on the brush
and that's a caiman so tap it off and
then start applying this to the lid look
at that gorgeous let's start putting
this on onto the entire space that has
no color yet now you're going to take
this beautiful beautiful gold color
this is trophy wife also by glamour doll
eyes it's amazing
so you're going to take that one with
the bigger you see the S brush take just
a little teeny bit because this just
pigment it as hell like oh my god
and take that and then you're going to
apply this just above that black you
made but don't go all the way on the
brow bone because I get that here and
you get like this greenish line so don't
go too far up like that just like that
and then take that's my attachment brush
and blend those edges
oh this is gorgeous I love that gold I
seriously love it but take some mark and
now you're going to keep adding gold to
the intensity that you like and I like
it pretty happy because oh my god this
color is to die for
now with that same brush you use for the
gold go in black of course you wipe it
off of it and read black in that black
in between the gold and the green make
that point again
go in and we get darker Jeffery our
highlight you're going to take Jett so
the favorite Mac color of mine the white
and this is going on to the brow bone
and now it's the time to blend all those
other colors down just blend them down
especially here just blend it down and
top and I what you're now going to do is
repeat the colors you have on so now I'm
gonna repeat the goal again then the
black again then the Shamrock again and
then I will tell you how to finish up
with the lower lid so I repeated all the
colors and where you are now going to do
is take a flat shader brush and you're
going to place it at that beginning of
the line of the black and sweep it in so
place it and sweep in sweep in I don't
do this but I sweep it in go back and
sweep and go back and sweep in so sweep
in sweep in sweep and sweep in blended
your bit white doing that and what that
will do is give that really really
really pretty gradient effect
now if weird alertly you're going to
take this brush and go in black put this
on the work put this on the outer third
of the lower lid that actually go a
little bit more in and then take trophy
wife that beautiful gold color and that
is going on the middle
then take some mac nylon and put that on
the inner corner they're going to line
your lips with l'oreal super liner and
then at your mascara i'm going to use
the Max Factor false lash effect and
then I will tell you what you with the
lips of right back so on the website I
applied some Mac miss lipstick my
favorite and on top of that the really
cool gosh I'm light and shine lip gloss
in number six you know come on with the
lighting I love this one Oh
anyway that's why they use something
lips um I hope you like it go get your
pigments from glabra doll eyes @ww

god the colors are so pretty they go on
so good and I love them so thanks for
