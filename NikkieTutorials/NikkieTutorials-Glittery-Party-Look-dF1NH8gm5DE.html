the look on that I wore yesterday in my
video on my hair and on the video that
with the flawless skin at the end in the
beginning yeah that makeup um I got some
requests to do this look so here I am
doing it I hope you like it
and if you want to know how I did it
keep on watching
for a base today I use my Miss Helen
eyeshadow base as always and to make it
a little bit lighter
I added some my axe milk jumbo pencil
and I'll go ahead and apply some satin
taupe by Mac on your lid and blending it
out a little bit on the crease so take
that on the shader brush start patting
this onto the lid and the reason why I
did that white is to make that sentence
Hope stand out a little bit more so I'll
play it and go a little bit up into the
crease and blend it out then you're
going to take next
sweet Sienna pigments it's so pretty
and you're taking a 222 brush you're
going in that pigment just rolling it in
and then what you do is apply this to
the crease and blend it all the way up
to the brow not on the brow bone itself
but right under it there you want to go
really high up some more you really want
to go out with that color then you take
some more set in taupe and we apply that
to the lid
that for our highlight on the brow bone
we're going to use the two-faced bitch
by bitch-slap Cosmetics the light color
with a 252 and start putting this onto
the brow bone and blend me down just
blend it down here as well then you're
taking some more sweet Sienna you want
to make it nice and dark again
so take some more and go back in the
crease now for the lower lid you're
going to take set in taupe again on a
pencil brush and put this on the first
half off the lip then you take sumptuous
olive and go in the color that is going
on the middle of the lid now for a
difficult part you're going to take lash
glue and you put that on the back of
your hand a little bit like that and
then you take a mango brush and ogled of
glitter
no um antique gold glitter by Mac you
take them on the brush you're going to
put it in that um in that glue and it
will become a paste and that pace will
be your liner but just watch what I will
do like that you take some more put it
in the liner and then you're going to
lie so take some
line your lid love it some more
but then when that glue is placed you're
going to take some glitter just on the
brush and place it on that glue lays it
on that glue and this will make it so
glittery and so pretty put the brush up
a bit and take some more of that glue
you just made and this is going on the
inner corner of the lower lid I need
some more because it's drying
work quickly with this and then place it
on that glue be careful because it gets
on your lashes too but anyway that's it
now I'm going to apply my false lash
effect by Max Factor and then I will be
back to tell you what to do with the
lips on my lips I apply some Mac miss
lipstick on my favorite and that's it
that is how you do on the look that I
wore in how to get a flow phase at the
end and in my hair routine Singh video
so I hope you like it this is really
cool for a party um be careful with a
lash glue note because um it can get in
your lashes and your lashes and get a
little bit tacky so I hope you liked it
please come in rate and subscribe bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
