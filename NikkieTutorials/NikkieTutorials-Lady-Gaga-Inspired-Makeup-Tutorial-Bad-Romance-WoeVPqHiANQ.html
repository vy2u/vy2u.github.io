romance
Lady gaga inspired look I'm inspired by
her path on top scene I'm inspired by
the big eyes cut crease and then when I
think of Lady gaga I think of color I
think pink I think of glitter so I added
this glitter just because I love it and
this cut crease was totally inspired by
jean-francois CD I know I messed up in
the eye liner right there I am in such
awe right now I had to take it off and
my eyes are tearing and I really have to
hurry up but I hope you like it and if
you want to know how I did this keep on
watching ok so again you don't want to
apply your face makeup first because
we're going to work with glitters and
when you get fallout it is so much
easier to get that away without sticky
foundation on so the first thing you
want to do is apply a base to your list
to prevent them from creasing and make
the colors pop a bit more so I'm going
to UM use my Catrice day on an eyeshadow
base and Mac's painterly paint-pot and
then I will be back this is me trying to
swatch stuff I am totally totally
totally not prepared for this book so
I'm thinking of cutting accretes with
white black gray and pink but I don't
know where to place a pink so I can
place it on the lid but I can place two
here too so I think I know what I'm
gonna do but bear with me if it doesn't
come out that cool I'm gonna start off
with NYX jumbo pencil in milk and that
is going on too
and one and of course the first color
I'm going to work with is max gesso and
gesso is that color right here the white
I hit the pan like crazy so I need a new
one I want a semi one and I'm getting a
239 by Sigma and I'm really going to
pack on that color onto the brush
because you want the lid to be white
like no question about it it's white
then you're going to Pat that onto the
way you don't want to on swipe it
because with swiping you are moving the
color so the color is less opaque I know
that stuff so just Pat it on so now
we're going to cut the crease and with
cutting the crease it is just you need
to practice it before you never have
done it so if you've never done this you
should practice I really recommend that
cuz it ain't that easy at the beginning
I'm going to cut the crease with a black
shadow and this is B slap but you can
use any black eyeshadow you want and
this is the nasty B and we're going to
take the black color oh and this is such
a long time go that I ever cut my crease
so wish me luck and especially with
these on but okay so um you're going a
bit above your crease and bring it into
your nose and all that good stuff so
just watch what I do I'm going to eat
this forward because I know this is
going to take some time so rich look
I know right now it looks like crazy
bombshells
but um now you're just going to take the
black and you're just going to blend it
out and in what you do want to keep in
mind is that right here you can blend it
in that is absolutely no problem but you
don't want to go inwards right the more
you come into your nose the less you
want to blend it down because that ain't
that pretty with a cup crease so I'm
saying above that line and I know right
now it looks really silly but trust me
will turn operating
now you just want to blend the black
everywhere but again the more you come
into your nose area the less you want to
blend it because the more in the sharper
it should be
now I'm going to take just a little bit
of max wedge and blend that at the edges
and you won't really notice this color
it is just helping me to blend that
black a little bit easier and you can go
all the way and down there if you like
and for the highlight I'm going to take
max gesso once again with a 275 5 Sigma
really digging out that color right now
and then it's going on the brow bone
now it's time to just blend blend blend
you're going to take black and blend it
above that line and take the wedge and
just make sure it completes so I'm just
going to take some more black I'm just
going to try to complete this look by
adding black wherever I want it and I'll
make good stuff so that is what you want
to do
but you know want to do is apply
foundation contour shade blush concealer
and all that stuff because the right
after never going to do the lower lid so
be right back
now this goggle look is kind of inspired
by the bass seen in her fat Roman's
video it just kind of inspired by her
extravaganza it kind of bad Romans
inspired in the entire look of this
because she wears white and black and I
bet that on the upper lid but I thought
of like Gaga is color Gaga pink and um
what I'm going to do pretty lower lid is
I'm going to be inspired by the fastest
team so I'm going to make really big
eyes because this looks like big eyes
but if you make it bigger in here too it
will be like boom you know so that is
what I'm going to do and then I'm going
to add some pink later and it's going to
be so fun I took off my hand gloves for
a second because it's weird doing your
makeup with them but for the end look I
will put them right back on
so that's would be lower lit so I'm
going to lower lid I'm going to take and
when I extend the pencil and milk again
and line my waterline so I'm going to
make a black line under my eye for the
new eye socket thingy oh it's hard just
do it
and then connected with that upper part
like that and then I'm going to take my
mehron pellet and mail and it's really
nice for these things and I'm going to
use the white color I'm going to use eye
drops to make it moist you can use water
you can use anything one of money is
eyedrops because that is what I have
just fill it up
what I'm going to do now is just like in
my Barbie video I'm going to take a
brush like that and add fake eyelashes
with shadow so make just a little flicks
of big lashes so first I'm redefining
that line as I said I wanted something
kind of get this pink glitter and I got
it from Nikki 26 one of my fast he's my
mama
and um she sent me this and I I guess I
never asked her where she got it from
but I believe she got it from Claire's
she said not sure so I'm gonna open it
what I'm going to do with that being
glitter is I'm going to edit onto the
lower lash lines the fake lower lash
line so I'm going to put it here and
here and then dial it down so that is
what we're going to do right now I'm
just gonna
and um it doesn't matter that your
lashes are going to get killed right now
I didn't really think of that but it's
okay they will come back another look
now I'm taking a brush and the glitter
I'm just going to glitter that on the
glitter is pink but when you look in
another light it is orange and it has
blue reflects it's just really pretty
but I really like what that glitter does
so I'm going to take some more glue and
um extend it all the way here because I
really love how does glitter looks with
this look really makes it yes so I'm
just gonna get some more glue
as you can see I try to look down to see
how the glue reacts when there is no
shine on the glitter so when you look
down it still has a nice shape but when
you look into the light you have all
these glitters and I love this about the
look it's so Gaga right now and love
love love it so it is to the other side
and then we will be back so my lips I
applied some creme the nude lipstick and
really big false lashes they are called
Paris Paris by Manic Panic and I got
them from um um
attitude Holland and El or calm I don't
know this is my gaga inspired look it's
completely inspired I hope you like it
thanks for watching and I hope you liked
it bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
