guy look LM in my um video like last
Friday I asked you guys which lady
garlic do you want to see and he got so
many comments like I want to see the
Grammys I want to see the Minnie Mouse
type of luck from paparazzi I'm gonna
love see love game I'm gonna see the
next act for a view glad I want to see
this that's what I'm going to do is I'm
gonna do a Gaga series I'm so excited
about this I love Lady Gaga she is she
is there she is it she is my hero when I
grow up I want to be like Lady gaga
anyway today I was inspired by the Mac
at four fever glam with Lady Gaga and
Cyndi Lauper and don't have the lipstick
because it is and oh yeah but if it does
come out really soon
I'm gonna get like ten of these even
though I don't like the color it says
Lady Gaga so it's mine I love it I know
if you like it too and if you have any
questions at the end of this video thank
you for watching and stay tuned
okay the first thing I did was apply a
base to my lids to prepare my eyes from
creasing and I use my Catrice day on
eyeshadow base with Mac's painterly
paint-pot
the first color we're going to use is
max Brahms and Lady Gaga has a really
bronze copper smokey eye which I love
and the first brush I'm gonna use it's a
239 it's dirty because I used it for it
this eye but you're gonna get that
bronze and you're going to put that on
to the lid and all the way in and you
don't want to go any further than this
so you have half of the lip covered with
bronze and you're staying under a deck
crease now I'm going to take mex and
bark and this is my favorite matte color
and I'm gonna get that on the other side
of the 239 and this is going on the
other half of your eye lid and blending
it with the bronze but this color can go
higher up because it's gonna get smoky
and raised so I'm going to take a Mac
two twenty two brush and this on spiced
chocolate quad by Mac this was the cult
of Terry collection and like two years
ago and I'm gonna use this color right
here and that is fresh I'm gonna use
brash and brash is a really really
pigmented color and I'm taking that on a
two twenty two you're going to blend ed
and me inner crease and the inner crease
is this is your crease and this if you
fold it in half you have your inner and
your outer crease and I'm going to
an inner crease and blend it right there
and then blend it with the bronze as
well just sweep it over a little teeny
bed you still want to see the bronze but
the bronze has to have like a copper
shimmer now I'm going to take a 217 by
Mac and this one is dirty as well and
I'm taking some work that embarked and
I'm going to work that into the crease
and blending it with that brush and that
outer crease so here is the in the
crease and here is the outer crease and
what I'm going to do is take a sigma 224
and makes a wedge and with which you're
going to blend the edges of this look so
which is our blending color
now I'm going to intensify that embark
just a bit more and as well for the
brush
okay now for Lady Gaga look she has this
outer corner really really dark so I'm
gonna take a matte black shadow this is
beast left nasty bean and I'm gonna take
the black car of course and I'm taking a
217 and just dip it slightly in tap any
excess off and work that in that outer
corners and go up into the crease
because it really goes from a bronze
copper color to a really black color so
just smudge that along the lash line as
well and work it in that crease I'm
gonna take a pencil brush like that one
that is from essence of beauty and I'm
taking the black and this is going along
the lash line don't go all the way in
but especially on the outer corner she
wanted to make you want to make it black
because that is just really black on her
now for the highlight I'm going to use
Mac's vanilla and with ears stick them
onto 75 this is my favorite highlighting
brush and this is going on my brow bow
and not only on my brow bone because I'm
gonna use it on the inner corners here
well that's here here as well sorry
and what this will do is that will open
up the eyes with smokey eyes I always do
this trick because it really opens up
the eyes and I don't only do this but
smokey eyes I do it all the time because
I love that trick now because her look
is kind of orange on the picture I'm
gonna take this max rule color this is
Max rule and with a 224 of it Sigma I'm
just gonna dab it a little bit in and
this is going on the edges just for some
orange feeling to it
you know this will warm the look up a
bit stable Lauren lid I'm gonna take
embark with that pencil brush we used
for the lash line
I'm just gonna smudge that all the way
till here now I'm going to take mixed
bronze and with the tip of the bristles
of that pencil brush I'm gonna just much
have along my lash line and like the
middle right there like that and then to
make it a little bit more warm I'm going
to brush and with the tip of the
bristles just a little tiny bit and then
put that in the middle of bronze like so
now I'm going to take my NYX jumbo
pencil in milk and and then take vanilla
again and pop that right over that now
as I said her look is quite black so I'm
for the lower lash line I'm going to
make it more black too so I'm going to
take that black the tip of the bristles
of that pencil brush I'm going to smudge
it along my lash line so around here so
that is it British shadows now I'm going
to line my waterline with black tech
fluid line I love black track fluid line
for on your waterline because it stays
put the entire day then I'm going to
line my upper lash line with Lancome's
art liner and then I'm going to use
mascara I'm going to use a Ledge
architect by L'Oreal and then I'm going
to show you what I'm gonna do with the
lips so be right back
first I'm gonna pipe some concealer I
always apply concealer just to get the
true color of the lipstick or the gloss
always use concealer always do that here
from lipstick um in the Netherlands and
in
other countries you have this on brand
called Catrice and this brand has a new
collection called the new collection and
oh my god my knight hurt that name I was
like oh that's my collection because
always have new lips so I got this new
lipstick in number Co one soft coral and
this is so pretty
it's like um it's like gosh darling but
more pink and I love it so much
I'm gonna play right now and over to
some part this is the product I
mentioned before I started rambling
about doing my lips it's this illamasqua
shared lip gloss and oh my god you guys
are like oh hi Nikki are you finally
going to put a color like that on your
lips what this is is a illamasqua sheer
lip gloss and the name already says it
it is sheer so it doesn't go on like
this unless you really build it up and
you want this color but I love this you
guys this is the color Mina
this is sheer lip gloss by Illamasqua
and Mina and this is so pretty if you
play really really lightly you get this
really soft playboy pinkish nude
lipstick car I love it if you build it
up you get a nice warm pink color and if
you really really really build it up you
get this I love this color
but I'm gonna do is on the pink chair
