really dramatic black orange pink and
white look I did this look because I was
inspired by um like the catwalk my
inspiration was um what would I let my
models wear if I was a designer so I was
like oh my god if I were a designer if I
was a designer I would let my mom's rock
the best colors on their eyes like this
I want them to be extreme but the
blending needs to be extreme too and so
if I was a designer and I could give my
model some makeup I would give them this
look for my make up show I know it's a
really long story but anyway I hope you
like it and please keep watching
everyone now how I did this
you're going to start this look up with
a base as always and this time I used to
keep rhymer poaching again and as you
can see we're going to start off with
gesso again my Mac and you're going to
apply this really heavily really heavily
onto the brush and don't go too far in
so start right here patting it on don't
go any further than that
then blend it upwards and then start
patting it out and making it even and
all that good stuff okay next step I
applied some tape to the outer corners
of my eye because we want that black to
have an edge so take any black you have
I'm taking one from the 88 palette and
take this on the brush and start pack
this onto the lip it's so where with the
tape on but okay
start packing this onto the lip and then
blend it really lightly with the gesso
go really lightly with this I'm almost
not pressing my brush onto the skin
more start patting it on to the remains
phase okay then take some more and to
make it go up really high you're just
going to do this dead easy isn't it stop
taking it down and how when you can't
come near to the Y you're blending it
now you're going to take max rule really
pretty color with a blending brush and
go in that color like that then you're
going to apply this right above the
black but make sure you blend it really
well up and down with the black so you
get that nice gradient effect like here
start applying that you can go on to the
crease because you can make it darker
anyways and then go up and really make
it nice and vibrant
now going this purpley color right here
it's not going to add as the great pink
color but it's going to make a base so
apply that right there
take some more and blend it with the
orange and with the black and the white
with all of colors to blend it with but
anyways now you're going in a more pink
color I'm going this one third up from
the pink row go into color and start
blending this into the crease first and
then go up blend it with the orange and
then wipe off that brush really really
well and just blend out those edges of
it that take some more of that pink and
reapply it blend it out here a bit then
you're going to take a 252 brush by Mac
and going gesso and we're going to apply
this as our highlight and just go all
the way like this so that's nice and
blending with all the other colors just
take it down and blend the hell out of
there
take the brightest pink the Omni on
almost and grab that one and apply that
as your pink not too much though now
we're going to take off the tape and you
notice that there's a really sharp line
and here it isn't that's because I
let it out if this little brush right
here so go at the edges and make
circular motions until it's kind of soft
and take more of the black color and
reapply it start blending it up all the
other colors
so my camera cut off and I took some
orange and blended that out then take
that neon pink almost and reapply that
to the mix then with that same blending
brush go in the black color and just
blend it onto the crease of that Hey
then take just a little bit no not a
little bit just take more gesso reapply
that really heavily so that's nice and
booming again came in what with it sorry
okay with that 252 going gesso and
reapply it here a bit and blend it a bit
my brothers listen to music like that
for lower lip we're going to add some
black eyeshadow so apply mop
what are they doing
it's crazy now walk that brush up really
well and going gesso and apply that to
the inner corners like that now I'm
going to apply just some mascara and
curl my lashes using Mac's pectoris
false lash effect and then I will be
back so my lips I apply some concealer
just to make them look dead really and
then I edit some hot pink lipgloss on
top of it and I really love this look so
I hope you liked it and umm please
