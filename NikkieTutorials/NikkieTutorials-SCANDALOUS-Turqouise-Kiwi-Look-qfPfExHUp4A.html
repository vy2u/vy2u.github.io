bright outgoing boom look it's gorgeous
I love it and I hope you like it too and
if you want to know how I did this keep
on watching
we're going to start this look off with
a base and I use this little Urban Decay
primer potion okay first step in this
very cool tutorial is apply gesso by Mac
really heavily on the inner third of
your lid going a little bit up and then
blend it out so really pack it on the
brush get a lot of gesso on it like that
start patting this to that inner corner
and then blend it out of it and Pat it
because that way you will get the most
color and then go up now we're going to
take this gorgeous gorgeous color by
scandalous scandalous cosmetics so cool
and this is bright turquoise and with a
239 take the other side of the brush and
pack that on the brush not so much
because you will get full out on that
brush start patting this on the lip but
stay under that crease go all the way to
the outer third let's stay under that
crease take um quite a small shader
brush and take the 88 palette and go in
that color that color right there take
it on the tip of the bristles the tips
weight upon the palm back like that and
then start applying this into the crease
and don't go any further than that aqua
that turquoise sorry so blend it in that
crease but dome don't you dare it go any
further than that blue light some take
some more
I'm start scooping it up and take care
217 Bolan O'Hara blend it out of it now
we're going to take a pallet again and
take this Kiwi color this Kiwi color get
it on the tip of the bristles of your
217 and start applying this above that
green and really I up really high up to
the brow them using circular motions and
windshield wiper motions take some more
blend it all the way up then take that
other green and blend that with the Kiwi
color someone sneezed it's rare
blend it just like that
now you're going to grab just a little
bit more no not a little bit more just
take a lot more of gesso replay that and
what we're now going to do is blend it
on the brow bone so padding on the brow
bone blending it with that key wheat
color take that 217 again and blend it
all out a bit
now take that 239 and go back in that
scandalous shadow and reapply this to
the lid again blend it slightly with the
gesso that now we're going to make a
darker with a 217 go in the color above
the black from the 88 palette that took
it off then start applying this right
between that turquoise and the green so
hard off actually let me take a smaller
brush like this
go in the car buff the black make it
work then blend it with our color on it
up into the green you thought and take
with the 217 go in the black color of
the palette make it even more dark than
it already is
compare to the other eye and just blend
it all up then wipe the brush up really
well and
in that Kiwi color blend this above the
black blending it with the gesso and the
black color dot then go in that bright
green color going to blend that just a
bit lower down and take our Sonia Kashuk
brush blend it'll add a bit
and with that 2:17 go back in the black
color make it dark again just go for it
make it dark that now you're going back
in gesso with a stiff shader brush make
it unique again other side go in that
scandalous color and really really make
that one really bright like bright in
your face bride we're going to do our
lower lip what's the 239 brush up really
well and with the tip going gesso and
apply this to the inner 1/3 but then
take that scandalous bright turquoise
I'm going to plot this remaining space
making a funny face now
like that then on the outer third blend
the black color inwards and that's it
wipe it up a bit clean it up and that's
it I'm now going to apply some black
drive fluid on my Mac and my new
favorite mascara which is Max Factor
false lash effect and then it will be
back to tell you how to finish up so my
lips I applied some gosh lipstick in 1 3
4 darling
and my favorite lip gloss or plush glass
by Mac which is been too full
