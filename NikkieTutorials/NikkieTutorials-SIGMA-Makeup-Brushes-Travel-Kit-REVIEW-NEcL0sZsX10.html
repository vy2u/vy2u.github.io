review my new found love I cannot stop
bragging about it against my friends and
I cannot stop looking at them and be so
proud and today I'm gonna review the
nice in pink Sigma brushes treble kit I
am in love so if you want to know what I
think about these brushes please keep on
watching
okay so as you might know I won the
Sigma July 2009 contest and it was so
much fun to do and this was my prize the
nice and pink travel kit and first of
all I wanna sing Sigma for the amazing
contest it was so much fun and it was
just amazing and fact that I won I was
like oh my god and all the viewers were
so supportive and so nice and I want to
thank you each of the bottom of my heart
so let's talk brushes this is amazing
as you can see it comes in this cute
pink little thing and they come with
like a flyer nice and pink what is your
treble style and then these how you rub
brushes they have in the trouble kit and
that is so smart of them because some
brushes I was like what the eff I do I
have to use this bar but now I know and
they give you a cart with Sigma makeup
core congratulations and this tells you
how to take care of your brushes and all
the good stuff then I also got this
little gift again in a nice pinky bag I
love this handbag and they gave me this
is so sweet a cutie little foundation
brush it's the ss190 and it's so good
and I am going to use this for my
mayoral palace because I love how this
blends out all the paint on my face so
thank you so much Sigma so here comes a
heii of this video the travel kit look
at this it comes in this nice roll and
at the UM it has a magnet so you don't
have to like with purses here like that
whole and the the thing that points out
it has to always find the hole to stick
and
the clothes I hate that but with the
stigma you have Megan and just like that
and you're good oh it's perfect so this
is what the brush kit looks like oh my
god right so let me show you the brushes
it has a 239 8 SS 239 and this is so
good
I use it today and I use a yesterday for
the first time and I'm loved
so let me take the real um from that the
239 and as you can see on the 239 by Mac
it's a lot more smaller sorry for my
nails I know
and the Sigma is much more wider now
what I like about these 2 for the Mac
one I love to be secure on the lip or a
lick hard for secure work but for the
Sigma I love it to just pack on the
color really quick and you're done it's
so good and it's also really good for a
highlight on your brow bone it also got
the 194 concealer brush I don't really
use this one I'm honest I did not use
this one because I always blend out my
concealer with my fingers now I found my
new favorite brush you guys know I am in
love with my Sonia Kashuk blending brush
I found in love this is the Sigma 224
brush and this is amazing to blend out
your crease it takes no effort to blend
and you're done in half a minute with
one in one eye it is so good and this is
my new favorite brush I love it Sigma
this is the best of the entire kit now
we have the 219 this is really good as
well as to smoke out colors under my
lower lash line and I
always use this brush by my local beauty
supply store and I like to 219 way
better because it's bigger and this one
is a little bit too small for my opinion
so I love this one as well um it would
be great for defining your outer feet as
well I think it will be great for that I
haven't tried it yet but if you have it
try it out now for the face brushes I
have the 168 the angled brush and I know
these brushes are a little bit dirty
because I use them this is really good
for contouring or blush or highlight it
doesn't matter this brush is great I
always do two Coastal Scents one and oh
my god I always thought that this was
the best but mmm
this is perfect it blends out the blush
so pretty I love it let me go to the
duo-fiber stippling foundation brush and
I am in love this again I have the
Coastal Scents one and it sheds like
hell I I cannot start talking about it
it sheds like hell I hate it and it was
laying around there I wasn't using it
because it chat so much and then I got
this one I was like oh my god oh my god
it actually worked an advance on my
foundation so pretty and I absolutely
love that so a 10 plus for this one
right here now for the last brush in the
kit on you happy 150 brush and this is a
all over face power brush so you can set
your foundation with powder or blush or
anything you like I use it to set my
foundation and it's really soft
it's so soft um again I really like this
a little bit of shedding now and then
not
time with nothing and it's really pretty
and really cool so again this is the
travel kit nice and pink um I got this
as a prize for the contest but you can
get it for $49 and it is so worth all
the money it is worth it until you die I
love it so again I was not paid to do
this this was a conscious uhm prize that
I won and I was so in love with them
that I needed to do a review on them so
I really loved it one downside if I
could improve this kit and this is not
to take Sigma down because I love Sigma
all of the people at Sigma I love how
they work their shipping they're so fast
but if I could change one little thing
on this travel kit is um take the
concealer brush away and put a brown
eyebrow brush in it like an angle brush
for your brows um it's just a little kit
um the concealer brushes okay I use it
for album painting my face as well for
brush for on my lid that mehron it's
really cool for that and um this just a
little thing that I would change again I
won't take Sigma down Sigma is amazing I
will take it up I recommend it to
everyone who is starting out in heaven
and hasn't got a lot of brushes in your
kit and wants to start out and I am love
Sigma and yeah I'm so in love them I I
cannot stop writing above them so thanks
