everyone today I'm doing this look and
this look is quite a bit different we're
going to do like a neutral look but um
with a spin of color as you guys know I
love love love color um but I got some
requests on neutral eyes but I I just
cannot do just neutralize I just don't
like that so I did neutralize with the
twist of blue and aqua and dark blue and
um anyways I hope you guys like this
please do try it out you can use the top
part for any look and you can change the
lower part for any look at what you can
umm instead of blue you can make it pink
or orange or copper or green or yellow
or anything so I hope you guys enjoy
this look and keep watching
okay I already applied my base and I use
two today I see Capri stay on I should
away and like Mac painterly paint-pot
so the first thing we're going to do is
apply our lightest color to the lid and
inner corners I'm gonna use Mac's
vanilla this is probably one of my most
favorite colors by Mac ever it's so
versatile I love it and I'm getting a
Sigma 239 bling two Sigma's in the
sidebar I love those brushes and
everyone should get that and I'm going
to start applying this on to the lid and
don't forget the inner corners right
here so get that in the inner corners
and then go on to the lid all the way in
now I'm going to take max copper plate
and Max cup plate is like a gray brown
color love that color I just got like
three days ago
and I'm taking a Mac 217 and I'm going
to put this on the outer corner and then
go in like this so you don't want to
make it like that you really want to
make it round go inwards so you start at
that outer corner and then you go
inwards like that and this way you will
get a rounded shape and I love that for
this look
now I'm going to take max embark another
one of my all-time favorites by Mac and
I'm taking a essence of beauty crease
brush from the duo and I'm taking the
biggest one and I'm taking my color and
this is to darken that outer part of the
eye and the crease a little bit more so
with this as well go in that round
crease you just created and blend it in
the outer corners to darken it out now I
like to take a sigma 224 and blend it
with no product on for now but what I'm
going to do now is take some more copper
plate and blend that above still keeping
it round of a blended above now I'm
going to take max vanilla again to
highlight my brow bone so let me get
that
we're now going to do the fun part the
lower lid
um you need nyx jumbo pencil milks you
make the on colors really pop that is
what you need the first step I'm going
to apply this to my inner corner or and
now you're going to blend it out with
your ring finger
like thigh and now I'm taking a 275 by
Sigma n vanilla and those the only money
in a corner then I like to do the outer
corner with the smaller size duo brush
from the duo from essence beauty and I
like to embark and pop that right on the
outer corners of the lower lid sorry for
my mouth I suck at this I didn't I like
to do is to fun part I'm going to take a
glam Couture glam Couture eyeshadow and
blue sky blue sky and I'm taking that on
the tip of the bristles of that pencil
brush and I'm going to put that on the
middle and be careful you don't want any
fallout but just be careful
I'm sorry for my mouth but I have to
hold it like that because out I just
cannot do it my dad and now I want to
make that blue more dimensional so now
I'm going to take mechs blue um sorry
I'm going to take my seat and sky
mineralize duo and taking the dark side
and this is going to be blended between
the embarq
and the blue sky right here all right
there so you have Embarq sea and sky
blue sky and now for the fun part to
make it even more dimensional I'm going
to take you to 75 by Sigma and aqua vert
love this color by Mac and this is going
to be blended override the vanilla so
you have some on the brush and you're
going to place it over the vanilla just
like so and blend it with that blue with
that and I'm going to take more of that
blue sky and reapply that to the middle
so now I'm going to line my upper lid
and make it a nice cat eye with on
Lancome art liner then I'm going to use
my new favorite mascara ever
this is Maybelline the falsies I would
do a review on this very soon I love
this so much and um on my lips I already
get them I have concealer Catrice soft
coral and on my ex strawberry milk so
that is on my lips so I'm going to do
the mascara in the liner right now okay
so I hope you like this look you can if
you if you just don't care about other
people and you want to look sexy hot and
different I really wish that you try
this look out because I love this it's
totally another twist on just neutralize
as you guys know I love color and love
drama so this is exactly what I would
wear - I don't know school even school
is my test week more about that in
another video but um I really hope you
like this look I really do love it it's
one of my most favorite looks I've ever
done in the neutral section um if you
