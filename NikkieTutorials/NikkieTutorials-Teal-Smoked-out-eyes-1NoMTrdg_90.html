look using um the Hello Kitty to dolly
palette right I really love it this
palette right here don't you just love
that packaging and sturdy but it's this
palette it's to die for
and I did a look mainly using this color
and this one and that's it I feel like
it and if you want to know how I did
that super bright turquoise look keep on
watching
so for my base today I added this really
cheap auto shadow base which I probably
think is only available in the melons
but if you want to know it's miss helen
eyeshadow base and it's really good on
top of that i at a some nyx milk jumbo
pencil um on my lid and on my brow bone
and then I blended it all out so that it
was covered on my entire lid so now I'm
going to take a shader brush like that
like the 239 and I'm going and blue
sorry
and I'm going in gesso that color and
you're going to pick it on the brush but
you're only staying at this part right
here you're going up I'm staying in the
inner corner so you don't go on your
eyelid now you're going to take this
beautiful Hello Kitty palette to dolly
one this one whew that one we're going
in to dolly that um aqua color that same
brush just take the other side on the
brush and start applying this right next
to it going just about that far I'm a
bit more up patting it on and a little
bit more in then blending with the gesso
if you can see there you're going to
take skin the list cosmetics bright
turquoise that beautiful color you're
taking just a little bit and just next
to it you're going to Pat on and blend
it right next to that
like that then so scary I'm dropping a
book take stately black really pick it
on the brush like that and start
applying this to the lip blending it
with the bright turquoise and the colors
really blend easily together just go a
bit of your crease got my tape I totally
forgot my tape so I added some tape and
go back and stately black and just pack
it on that lid again and then make it
kind of a wing
ha
then go back into bright turquoise and
blend the line out a bit and then with
the brush off and go into Dali and blend
up with the colors and then take some
gesso and blend that again that now
we're going to do our crease we're going
to grab this essence of beauty um Chris
brush the bigger one we're going
steadily black move them in the crease
with it and don't go any farther than
the two dolly which is right here and go
any further in you get me that then go
into bright turquoise and blend above
those totally black they are taking a
217 and you're going into dolly and
blend this above all the other colors
just blender the buffle the others and
go as high up as you want
and with that 217 i'm grabbing right
turquoise and i'm blending that in the
crease with the two dolly and stalee
black then with that cheese i'm Tingo
and stately black and put this to the
crease as well take a 239 and go and
stately black again make it somewhat
darker
going bright turquoise again and blends
up and into dolly blend that now with
your 250 to go in gesso like three
swipes and then take white frost two
swipes this is going on your problem and
the milk pencil really makes that a
light highlight if you know what I mean
I hope you know what I mean because to
me it's clear then with a 217 just
repeat the colors on the crease remove
the tape and just like in only other
videos you're going to blend that line
out a bit because I like it chart but
not that sharp now if we're to lower
late you're going to grab the small size
one from the essence of beauty and go in
stately black and you're going to apply
this to halfway in and take some to
dolly and blend that next to it and then
take a lot of gesso and like two swipes
of white frost and blend that to the
inner corner that now you're to apply my
line on my upper lip which will be
L'Oreal super liner it's the same as the
intense liner you see it's the same one
so you can get super liner as well and
I'm going to apply my mascara which is
Max Factor Falls flash with that and
then I will be back to tell you how to
finish off this look so that was it I
hope you liked it on my list I put some
gosh lipstick in darling 134 and on the
lip gloss side I used both bountiful
plus glass by Mac so I hope you liked it
I really do enjoy this look it's really
fun and bright just the way I like it
and I hope you liked watching this video
