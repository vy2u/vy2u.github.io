do a second episode of the series with
me and J at the world wonders and this
week I will be doing a look inspired by
a Colosseum now it's Colosseum's I think
of fights
I think up fighting for your life and
but still looking pitch a with the
silver cleanse on so what I did was a
really really messy dirty smoky eye and
the silver stands for the students they
wear if they fight you know what I mean
so before I start with this look I want
to tell something really important if
you think oh my god I'm gonna wear a
look where I apply dark blonde right
here you don't have to do that you can
apply the dark brown on the lid wet and
decrees vanilla on the brow bone and the
silver on as a liner and you don't have
to apply here because if I am honest I
wouldn't go out like this but I love it
for the look for the video so I have
worn this out before I just wore it as a
smoky eye I was still the liner and I've
got tons of compliments on it and I
loved it so sure make sure to try this
look out also I want to tell you guys
that we have a special guest this week
in series um you just have to go to the
sidebar to see you it is I'm not telling
it yet because he is super great but I
can tell you he will knock your socks
off so thanks for watching if you have
any questions at the end of this video
about this book leave them in a comment
section below and please go subscribe to
jf and the special guests they're all
over the sidebar and thanks for watching
bye
okay so this look is really really
really simple you just have three colors
and the silver or any color you want for
that and I'm just gonna start off it's
super easy
you're going to take Meg's max Meg's Mex
wedge and then you're going to start off
by applying this here and go up so
you're just applying it in that's face
from your nose and then you go up into
your brow and then you blend it out of
it and you go crazy with it because
you're going with that color in the
crease as well just go in the crease and
make sure it it fits well with your eye
and then you can go out and this will
make that um I look like really what
sunken in like like you know so that's
what you want did your hair I just
burped and go all the way up to the brow
of course if you want to wear something
like this to two clubs you wouldn't
um apply it all the way here you just
apply it in the crease and make it all
pretty like that but since we were in
the Coliseum tonight we're doing it like
this like that and then you're going to
take
and bark and a 217 and you're just going
to get loads of it on the brush and
you're just going to darken up that nose
area so you're going up and you start
right here and then once you think you
have enough right there for now you're
going to take a 2:39 and get loads of
the color that's well on that brush and
you're going to apply that onto the lid
and this will make it nice and smoky and
sunken in so just work that onto the lid
and don't be neat with the blending in
the crease because it's gonna be hella
dark right there too so you can go right
ahead and take it up into the crease as
well now I'm going back with that 217
and I'm just gonna um blend it all
together so I'm gonna make parts darker
right here right here in the crease just
make it complete right here go out of it
blend into the crease and now I'm gonna
take max vanilla and my highlighter
brush and that it's going on this
thoughts off your eyebrow that is still
untouched you know what I mean make them
blend it down and I like to end it here
as well just to lighten things up a bit
and then I like to take a 252 by Mac and
blend the edges right here just soften
it up just a bit and here as well don't
make it a sharp line like I always do
would just soften it up by screwing
around with your 252 and then you can
reapply to wedge the embark and the
highlighter again so I know that's what
I'm gonna do right now now pretty still
the part and the lower lid you want to
take a pigmented silver as hell and this
is max platinum pigment um it is so
messy it gets everywhere but I love the
color so I'm gonna take some eye drops
put those on my hand
and wet a sort of liner brush I don't
know the name right now and what you're
going to do is grab the pigment so I
have it wet on my brush and you're just
going to line that around your entire
eye so first I'm going to use it as a
liner really simple that's nothing harsh
but just use it as a liner
and make it quite thick because with the
lashes it's gonna cover up a little bit
of that silver so make that line quite
thick and then you are going to apply it
to the lower lid wet as well and what
that will give it's like this really
unglue engg silver and look around your
eye I love that and again if you think
will does colors look SuperDuper pretty
with each other you can just tone it
down don't apply the brown all the way
there just make it a nice blended smoky
look with silver liner I love that too
so you have lined her eyes with the
silver and now I'm going to take a wedge
again and a 219 by Sigma if I can find
it there you are and you're just going
to blend that color around the edges of
the silver on the lower lid and I feel
like you can take a little bit of embark
and apply that to the edge vanilla again
and pop that on the inner corners right
there now I'm going to line my waterline
like this and this and then apply fake
lashes I do
Girls Aloud lashes I am loving those in
Cheryl that girl is so pretty and they
look like this really pretty so growth
of my lashes and Cheryl and then I will
be back to tell you what is on my lips I
guess on my lips I apply some creme the
nude I'm lipstick by Mac and concealer
of course and some tabulous dazzle glass
love that color you can really build it
up for a nice pink look but you can keep
it down with a little pinky tint to it
so I hope you'll like it again
again again I don't want you guys to
forget this that you don't have to go
out with a look like this you can make
it a smoky eye with embark wedge and
vanilla so thanks for watching and if
you have any questions leave them in the
