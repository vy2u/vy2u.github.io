with one perfect little great boy that
is out there on YouTube his name is a
Jean Francois CD but I call him Jay s
and we wanted to do a series of makeup
that no one on YouTube had already and
he had this great idea of doing a series
for the world wonders how smart can you
be so the first look I'm gonna be doing
is Petra and Petra is in this great
country which I cannot pronounce English
oh here it is this is the country uh but
I was inspired by that underground city
the sand or desculpe surance looked
really yellow so immensely yellow and I
wanted to make it underground because
it's an underground city so that is the
dark ish tongue to it I hope you'll like
it please go check out on Jeff's video

and I look who's there so gonna miss her
so the first thing you want to do is
apply a base and I use my Catrice date
on I shall raise my mat pancha later to
dodge a my NYX jumbo pencil in milk and
now you're going to take your 120 pellet
and take this yellowy orange color that
yeah and I'm taking a 239 and it is
super pigmented like how like it gets
everywhere and then just Pat that on the
inner third of the lid
now I'm going to take next which and a
blending brush by Sigma and resistive to
24 and you just take that and you're
going to apply that into the crease and
what you want to do is go all the way in
here to your nose to make it like it
looks like your eyes are really sunken
in and I really like that so just do
that
now you're going to take mechs embark
this is probably my new most favorite
color by Mac ever it is so good and
you're going to take a 239 brush again
the other side or really pack that onto
the brush and then you're going to put
that on the remaining parts of the lid
and blend it with that yellow and once
you have blended with that yellow
properly you are going to take a 217 and
take that on it and go up into your
crease and then blending with the wedge
and just let that wet wing it out a bit
just a bit
and then go here as well
very going to take wet again and you're
just going to blend around the arm and
bark just to make it a nice gradient
effect why it's my computer go now send
by and then just blend it and then
you're going to do your highlight I'm
going to take a vanilla know with my 275
by Sigma and I love that brush I cannot
say it enough and you're going to apply
it on your brow bone and then you can
take a 252 and make this a line right
here really sharp and blend the edges
down of the wedge
talking about my the forego lower that
you're going to take embarked again and
you're just going to smudge that all
along it the lash line and I'm not gonna
show you because I'm gonna get comments
like oh my gosh so pretty when you do
your lower lip thank you I'm gonna take
my double pencil in milk and put that
into the inner corner like that is and
we're gonna keep it like that because
this really pretty I'm gonna take my
ring finger I'm blending out and get a
vanilla and take a Susan e5 and pop that
right there and then here as well right
here not on the yellow but right next to
the yellow and under the brown I'm going
to take next rule and you're just going
to dip that like in three times or
something and you just going to blend
that above the art like in the witch to
make it a nice orange pop very going to
line your waterline and your upper
eyelashes I'm going to use makeup
