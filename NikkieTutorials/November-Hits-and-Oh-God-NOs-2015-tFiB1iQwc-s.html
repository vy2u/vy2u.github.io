and oh god knows I know it only feels
like a week since you've last seen my
previous hit synagogue knows that's cuz
it's actually about a week ago because
my October his synagogue notes were
super late but now we're back on track
it's time for a November hits and God
knows I'm so excited I got a bunch of
amazing products to share with you a
couple of Nets of amazing products um so
yes that's let's do it so the first two
products I want to share with you are my
two favorite lip glosses of the moment I
know a featured fusion Beauty here
before and I wear this amazing red
lipstick but then I found out about
their lip glosses and these two right
here are my nude obsession of the last
month because I got this color right
here this is called in the flesh and
this is a classic nude color it's skin
tone it's light it's nude it's a bla
States voluptuous it makes your lips
look so I'm wearing it as a gloss today
I love it so much so this is my choice
for when I want a new lip but really
make it nude and glossy this option
right here this one's called angelic
this is a little bit more pink a little
bit more warm so I love these for
whichever mood I'm in if I'm a little
bit more in the fleshy mood I'm gonna go
for in the flesh if I'm a little bit
more in the cutesy pinky nudie way of
day I'm gonna go for angelic so I really
love these glosses they have a slight
tingle to them to make your lips look a
little bit more plumb not that I
necessarily need a lot more plum I love
these glasses and I highly suggest you
check in them out as the base underneath
the lip glosses lately I've been
obsessed with this melted lipstick by
Too Faced right here this is called
melted sugar and I've been wearing this
in I think two the three tutorials last
month and I loved it so much it's such a
beautiful nude I'm all about the news
lately
I know fall hit us and then winter is
right around the corner but I feel like
no no vampy colors I'm not in the mood
for you I was nude I am so obsessed with
melted sugar I love the consistency of
these and I met the people of two-faced
a couple of months ago and the story
behind them
so liquid lipsticks is amazing i'll ask
Jared the owner of two-face to do a
video on it soon cuz he now has a
YouTube channel but the story behind the
melted lipsticks is amazing and it makes
me love the products even more cm melted
sugar is an amazing nude it's not you
might it's not too warm it's perfect for
us pill beauties and also wearing it
today
underneath that gloss I dig for
foundation and I know I just mentioned
the liquid version the fluid version in
my previous it Synagogue dose but the
Make Up For Ever HD ultra foundation
sticks are so mind-blowing ly cool okay
so when you hear stick foundation you go
drag or you go pancake or you go pancake
II drag I know it's a known fact that I
don't care about that because I love
drag queens I love to kick it on every
now and then and some people will say I
kick it on every day but you know what
let a girl live I'm all about that but
what makes me love these so much is that
they give amazing coverage they stay on
like a dream you only need the tiniest
bit because they are so pigmented plus I
I in my opinion I think the stick
version of this foundation looks more
natural on the skin than the fluid
version I feel like the fluid version
kind of lays on top of the skin and
doesn't really do much whereas the stick
version you put it on your skin you
blend it in with a Beauty Blender and it
just looks like perfection I tried this
for the first time when it was in
Minneapolis to do my meet and greets ask
Ric all I could talk about to him was
like do you see my face right now it has
not broken me out I loved so much I
loved so much I loved so much check it
out so talking about my meet and greet
in Minneapolis with Sigma's I know a lot
of gurus mention Sigma and then they get
a lot of hatred because they say that
Sigma so sponsored whatever I know a
couple of brands here on YouTube are a
little iffy because people always think
they are sponsored but I really want you
guys to know that I would never ever in
my life promote something on my channel
I do not stand behind if I do not
believe in the product its
not going up on my channel whatever I
tell you guys I love I actually do
really love but I'm not gonna lie in the
past has been a little bit iffy for me
to use those products and tutorials
because you immediately get that
sponsored stamp so I met the amazing
people of Sigma back in Minneapolis and
their team is so amazing they
are so nice they are so driven so so so
sweet amazing and gorgeous and I love
meeting people behind a brand because
then they can really explain to you why
they created some products and how they
created them so the stigma team
introduced me to their aura powders and
in particular these two colors right
here this one right here is called pet
name and this one is called Nymphaea
so I arrived in Minneapolis and I met
the team behind Sigma and they showed me
these aura powders and immediately I
fell in love I mix them say a bad name
together put it on the apples of my
cheeks and I loved the color so much I
even asked him to make that shade and
call it Nikki I really really love this
combination
I love Nymphaea a little bit more than
pet name because pet names sometimes can
be a little bit too light to not there
and it saddens me to know that when I
really really love a product and it has
and if we name that people immediately
think you're sponsored when I'm not so
from the bottom of my heart I do want
you to know that these blushes right
here by Sigma are insane they rock my
brain and I'm not sponsored to say that
anything I say on my channel comes from
the heart talking about a powder back in
LA I bought this powder right here this
is Kat Von D locket powder foundation in
number 42 this has been such an amazing
setting powder so what I do is I apply
my new via man aftershave balm to prime
I spritz a little bit all nighter makeup
in a cave I go in with my foundation 6
by Makeup Forever a little bit of
concealer and then this powder comes in
and I apply it which is another favorite
the Becca buffing brush we all know I
got this because of Jeffrey
we use this when we did our collab and I
was so mesmerized by this brush because
I've always wanted it but I always
thought it would be too big for I don't
even know what to do with it and then he
used it for powder and his face looked
so so a week after I ordered this from
Sephora and I'm in love so this brush is
a hit for sure because it just bust in
powder in such an amazing quick way
because it's so big so you literally tap
tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap
tap done but back to the powder this
powder right here makes your skin so
smooth so perfectly perfect for the
longest time I would only set my
foundation using a loose powder never a
compact or even a powder foundation but
honey let me tell you once you get into
the powder foundation like a Bundy there
is no going back because your face will
look flawless and especially with the
ultra HD six and honey and perfect skin
and looks like you have faced tomb on
your face in real life it's so good the
makeup forever
now let's rewind back to 2010 29 the
makeup forever cama flage palette I feel
like every youtuber used this back in
the day back in the OG days of YouTube
and especially Marlena from makeup geek
and makeup a Tiffany D and so many girls
use this concealer and I always wanted
it but I could never get my hands on it
and then a couple of weeks ago when I
was in LA I saw this and it was a 28
Marlena pretty much I bought it because
it was so big back in the day and don't
really hear a lot about it anymore
nowadays but I'm bringing it back
because this concealer is so amazing you
need the tiniest bit and I use this to
spot conceal my face and just take like
a really tiny buffing brush and pick up
a little bit of the concealer and buff
it over any flaw or pimple or whatever
and it just hides it's just gone it's
just like where are you where are you
now
just to be burnt as you all know when I
talk about eyeliner I quickly mentioned
my Kat Von D tattoo liner in trooper and
my NYC black liquid liner I am pleased
to tell you there
for once there's a change in this
routine I always thought that the tattoo
liner by Catherine II was unbeatable
until I tried out her ink liner in
trooper
so there's tattoo liner in trooper and
ink liner in trooper and so I tried the
ink liner and I like this more because
it has a little bit of a stiffer brush
so the brush is um looks like that
that's what the brush looks like so the
tattoo liner in trooper it really glides
and moves and you can make tiny
beautiful precise little eyeliners with
it but this one is a little bit more
stiff so my routine nowadays when I want
a perfect wing first I go in with my
tattoo liner in trooper to make my wing
then go back in and create that triangle
create your wing so on the insides of my
eye I use ink liner to really get that
precise smooth line I connect the inside
to the outside so from ink to tattoo
liner and then I fill it all in
using a new favorite again by Sigma this
is the line ace in legend this is so
black so Matt it stays on like a champ
it's insane and again not sponsored to
say this but when you meet the people
behind the brand you want to know why
they made certain products and how they
made certain products and they told me
about the line ace and legend and I'm in
love I love it so much so these three
make the perfect wing of course if you
can do your eyeliner perfectly with just
one liquid liner go ahead you do you
good job you do you but I found that
with these three I can create perfect
lines a quick honorable mention goes to
Urban Decay's polyester bride I shadow
this eyeshadow has been doing it to me
lately it's such an amazing inner corner
highlight nose highlight brow bone
highlight you can highlight whatever you
want with this it's so highlighting I
think it's so amazing I love this color
so much I'm so honorable mention to that
also orphan black if you are not
watching orphan black on Netflix
wherever you want to watch it We Need to
Talk you'll never see such good acting
as you'll see in orphan black because
there's one main actress Tatiana
Lonie and she is the main actress and
she has clones and now a lot of people
go oh clones
boring but the show is so awesome
because Tatiana makes the world of a
difference in acting because she she's
like five characters at once and they're
all they're unique different person and
you can never tell it's all one person
it's just for the acting alone you have
to watch it because it's so good but the
storyline is amazing and I talked about
it on my snapchat all the time it's
funny it's intense it's it's all you
ever wish for in the show and I love
orphan black so much please check it out
and if you do let me know so those were
all my hits for the month of November
and without any further ado let's go on
to my oh god no oh yeah no so my very
first oh god no of the month is Sephora
heated eyelash curler if you've been a
subscriber of my channel for a couple
weeks now you'll probably have seen a
video called how to curl your eyelashes
the best way and it's a video on how I
heat up an eyelash curler with a blow
dryer which nowadays I deal with a
lighter cuz it's quicker but that's the
best way of curling your eyelashes so
after that video I was like okay okay I
remember seeing a heated eyelash curler
once so I ordered this one from Sephora
it looks like this and basically don't
ever buy it because it's the worst thing
ever you can hold that damn thing on
your eyelashes for twenty days and it
will not lift an inch you can heat it up
until it burns your eyeballs out and it
will not lift your lashes honestly I
take my eyelash curler I light it up
with a lighter like the metal up make it
warm make it hot curl my lashes that's
about 30 seconds to curl both lashes
both eyes that thing dinosaurs will be
back on this earth by the time my lashes
are straight the end girl no my next oh
god no and my last oh god no of this
month is the Beautyblender liquid
cleanser
I want an article on the internet on how
you can best clean your Beautyblender
because it's like their heart to clean
so in that article it's said to clean
your Beautyblender z' with just normal
bars so the best ones are from hotels
just stock them up take them back home
and you'll have the best beautiful and
your cleanser you could ever wish for
for free or for a couple of dollars I've
been cleaning my beauty blenders for a
long time that way and it's amazing it
gets all the foundation out it gets all
the gunk and dirt out and it just it
makes your Beautyblender feel and look
like new I was like that can't be right
because why would they release a
cleanser for it when a lot of people by
now know you can use hotel bar so and
let me tell you this stuff doesn't get
my Beauty Blender nearly as clean as my
hotel bar soap save yourself the dollars
mm-hmm save that for a lighter to buy to
heat up your eyelash curler and don't
even bother getting this cuz if you use
hotel bar soap or just any bar soap
please let it be clean you never know
where people have been and put their
hands around the bar so just use a
special one for the Beauty Blender only
because this will not get your Beauty
Blender as clean as hotel bar soap and
that's the guys that were my hit
synagogue nose for the month of November
