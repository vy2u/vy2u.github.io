doing vlogmas so hi guys welcome to my
November hit synagogue nose November
November
isn't that for V for Vendetta November
November will go cray in December
today I'm here to present you my
November hit Sunnah God knows and
November flew by I worked a lot in
November and I worked a lot basically
like period let's take the first product
shall we see oh my god yeah that's right
spongebob squarepants panties I went to
Primark in ain't OVA they recently
opened the the new one there and I was
going with looks fresh Erin also here on
YouTube and I saw Spongebob Squarepants
panties that was a tongue twister and
one of the things I saw was this panty
saying one happy sponge with fun buck
right next to your vagina stuff like
this makes my life worth living the next
time what I want to talk about is by
revitalash advanced and this is the
stuff that is supposed to make your
eyelashes grow it can't really be a hit
for me yet because I have started using
this about a week now and they say that
the first results come in like three
four weeks so I can't really show you
anything yet it's just my anticipation
it's killing me I can't wait for those
damn lashes of mine to grow um I will do
a full blog post review on this before
my lashes girl and after my lashes girl
it has yet to become a favorite but I
think it will so I'm just putting it out
here already as a lot of you know I am
following a hair course and we are
agency in Amsterdam actually this Sunday
is my last lesson it has been a crazy
ride I have learned so many stuff from
Glenn and Dennis which who are the
teachers and thank you so much if you
want to learn fashion hair go to we are
Agency in Amsterdam this is a thing
magic that you put over the nozzle of
your
we call it the blow-dry sack and then
with this right here it's sort of like a
diffuser and what we do with this is if
you have sort of Flyway so you want to
maintain you sprayed with a little bit
of hairspray and then with this sack you
go over it and it just becomes this
really smooth hemily piece of hair but
we also do with this is if you in
fashion we do a lot of the baby hairs so
when a model has baby hairs feet sort of
brush them on the face and make it a
thing to make that stick you spray with
hairspray the baby hairs in place and
then with the blow dryer sack you go
over it and then you sort of set it and
it stays on and it looks amazing and
this step right here is da bomb it is by
wire spark and it's called the silver
and titanium metal mesh diffuser three
nail polishes I've been loving this
month are by OPI and this is called the
my favorite ornament and I'm actually
wearing this on my ring fingers and on
my thumbs
my favorite ornament is a highly dense
glitter champagne gold packed polish
it's insane it's so beautiful this is
sort of like Christmas in a bottle it's
so gorgeous and just Sparkle of it and
just the majestical majestic goodness of
it it's just amazing and then next are
two polishes by Maybelline New York and
these are the colors show brocades and
these are the colors knitted gold and
this is a stunning color it looks so
magical and it's just so insane like you
have so many colors in one and it just
the effect is stunning and I absolutely
love how that base shimmer has a sort of
like champagne color but then in one
legged of chartreuse and they have the
rose gold sort of rosy glitters in it
it's I love it and then another
Maybelline Color show brocade polish is
foil flash and it has the same base so
it has that sparkly sort of champagne
chartreuse duochrome going on but then
the glitter in this is a silver an
eyeliner I've been loving this month is
by eyeko and this is called the liquid
metal eye
liner in black onyx and this is a huge
deal to me because I always wear my Mac
affluent lines in black track and dip
down so when I saw Chloe Morello here I
love Chloe she used it in a tutorial
recently and it's I was like haha that
is so easy to work with it is so
pigmented it smoothes on so easily I
need to try it I'm wearing it today
it's eyeliner I have on today let me put
those lashes out for you but this is the
eyeliner it has a soft shine to it which
I like and it's so easy to work with
it's really sort of wet but not too wet
so you can work with it easily from she
knows winter collection this year I have
been loving the illusion dome in-seat
fatale Fattah Sato fatal fatale this is
a beautiful shimmery taupe color with a
little bit of warm red mixed into it and
like the shimmer in it is silver and
it's just a party to look at and
actually this color is on my lids today
it's on my lids blended up until the
crease a lip combo that I've been loving
this month is a mixture of Bobbi Brown's
I'll lip pencil in pale pink and then on
top this lipstick it's the bomb this is
pure decoration by Mac and I'm wearing
the combination today and I worried in
my last video and I think the video
before that and the video before that I
got so many questions on what type of
new color I'm wearing lately because
people say it's the best sort of peachy
pinky nude color for fair people and I
totally agree because look at it I have
been a huge eyelash fan this month and
eyelashes are a harsh thing for me to do
because I often find false eyelashes to
be somewhat tacky but I have found a
technique thanks to RuPaul yes be the
God Almighty RuPaul from RuPaul's Drag
Race he has a book and my friend Joyce
talked about it and she said that in
that book he says that people who have
issues with putting lashes on need to
cut them he personally cuts them in five
while his makeup artist does Mathu
Anderssen which is like my makeup god
but I decided
have them into so like half half and
it's just that technique of putting the
lashes on then has helped me so much
because like the single eyelashes the
individual eyelashes that is way too
much work and then a whole strip of
lashes is I find that really it's just
such a struggle right now I just take my
lashes I cut them in half and do the
outer part first and then the inner part
and it's just so easy and quick and it
just it makes putting eyelashes on fun
again my favorite eyelashes of the month
are by Mac and these are the 36
can't-see-'ems because they're on my
eyes but if you like the lashes that you
see on me and in my previous video those
are the Mac 36 cut in half and a put on
put on I quickly want to talk about the
TV show that I love this month it's once
upon a time I I've been so busy lately
and just this week and last week I had
some time to kind of regroup and do
stuff again so I put on my jewel screen
with my laptop and my TV and then you
put your HDMI cable in and then you can
laptop but still watch TV through your
laptop so I put on once upon a time and
I did some blog posts and everything and
I catch up from season 2 episode 9 and 2
where I'm right now and I'm at season 3
episode 4 right now and it's so good
their twists of making Peter Pan evil is
just I love that because Peter Pan has
always been sort of setting like an
issue to me like he was too nice he was
too kind and now once upon a time made
Peter Pan evil and that's just like
amazing to me so if you like fairy tales
and sort of like drama and really
gripped makeup they were good makeup on
that show then go watch once upon a time
another thing I want to talk about is
Catching Fire the Hunger Games Catching
Fire that is a holy that is one
good fudging movie holy crap that oh
look at you out of the series is my
favorite which is catching fire so it
was
like they really had to step it up for
me because I liked the first movie The
Hunger Games but it didn't have the same
feeling as the book to me so I was
really hesitant to watch Catching Fire
because it's my favorite book so I
really wanted them to step up and they
did holy crap
the movie is exactly like I imagined it
the island is exactly how I imagined it
like everything is exactly how I wanted
it to be it has so many jaw droppers it
is intense you're on the edge of your
seat the entire movie it's good holy
 Jennifer Lawrence is so conscious
it's just an amazing movie it's so much
better than the first one the first one
was good the second one is perfection so
that was it for my hits this month let's
go on to the Oh God knows oh yeah
no I only have one oh god no this month
and that goes to Primark and not Primark
itself although I think in ain't over
the lines to get in are a little bit
just why but the primer paper bag
deserve a place in hell I went shopping
a couple of weeks ago to sort of I went
alone and I did some quite some damage
in Primark and I just had this big bag
of clothing and all these sort of good
Primark stuff in it and I walk out and
then that happens I don't know how I
don't know why but the handles the damn
handles break off the damn sack and I'm
just all my clothing all over aunt
Helens streets the paper bags of Primark
deserve a special place in hell
