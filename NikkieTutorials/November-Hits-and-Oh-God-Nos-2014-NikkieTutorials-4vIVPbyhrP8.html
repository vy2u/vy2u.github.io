I come bearing makeup a lot of makeup
hey guys so it feels absolutely great to
be back I'm excuse my French excuse my
French
I am so glad to be back here and to get
back into the swing of things and just
get my flow my usual flow back and it
just it feels great to be here two times
a week again November sucked YouTube
wise I'm so sorry with Adam so sorry and
you also might have noticed that it is
Monday now and my next video will
actually go up on Thursday that is
because I am changing my uploading
schedule
no more Tuesdays and Fridays I just let
me keep it short Friday's just did not
work for me so I had a vote
I had a pull on my website Knicks
tutorials calm and you guys voted and
number one was Monday and Thursday was
in third um and on second was Wednesday
but I thought that Monday and Wednesday
were too close to each other so I made
it Monday and Thursday
so welcome to Nikki tutorials with a new
uploading schedule I post new videos
every Monday and Thursday from now on
without any further ado I have some
great hits for you this month so let's
get right to it so I wanted to start off
with the NYX butter gloss in maple
blondie because as you know I did that
shoot in Mexico and maple blondie butter
gloss by NYX was the color that I popped
on every models lips throughout the
entire day and it just it was the
perfect Mexico color I really want to
show you right now but I left it in
Mexico I was like grabbing my stuff for
this video and I was like where's maple
blondie I left it in Mexico but just to
show you what the packaging looks like
this is creme brulee butter gloss by NYX
the butter glosses by NYX are one of my
all-time favorites but maple blondie was
the big star of that entire week of
shooting but I left it there probably on
the beach another gloss I've been loving
for that Mexico shoot as well plus ever
since
I discovered it there it just became a
hit all along
it's the Dior do you're addict gloss in
433 and it's just a beautiful shimmery
glittery curly peachy orange color and
again this totally ties into like this
summer look for Mexico but it actually
doesn't give a whole lot of color which
I like because I kind of used it as a
shine and a glimmer on top of the lips
of my models it gives up a little bit of
color definitely but nothing's super
opaque so it's great to just pop over
those lips and look great and just call
it a day Oh
blondes gold pigment by Mac I've always
been a said of blondes gold I've had it
for years loved it for years but again
in Mexico they're after this there's
another Mexico item then I'm done with
Mexico okay I promise I soaked lost gold
I've always lost lost gold but I
discovered it as a cheek highlight in
Mexico because I I cannot wear it as a
cheek highlight because there will be
too dark for me so you would actually
see a shadow instead of a highlight but
for people who are more tanned than I am
blonds gold oh oh oh I feel the tutorial
in Mexico that is going to go up next
week and I used blonds gold as the
highlight so definitely keep an eye out
for debts but blonds gold if you're more
tan than I am then this is just oh oh I
promised last Mexico favorite this is
makeup studio D effects in shine you've
heard me talked about that's not English
you have heard me talk about this for
years and years and years I I'd be using
it for years and years and years and it
just it doesn't stop being awesome so
the makeup studio jewel fix and shine
are just a pigments a slash glitter um
but it's not really glitter coz there's
not any type of glitter particles in its
but it's just a really high reflective
high shine silver sparkly pigments and
in Mexico I use it on all my female
models on the inner corners on the inner
corners of the eyes and it looked bomb
it just bomb next things I want to talk
about our color pop eyeshadows and I was
too
these a couple of months ago but I never
really opened the box
what the hell what was I thinking why
did I not open that box so the
colour-pop eyeshadows are actually
called a super shock pressed pigments
and they come in a bunch of colors like
so many but my favorite is dis little
kid right here filled with all these
bright colors so we got this beautiful
bright electric curl we got this grass
green royal shimmery blue we got this
sparkling black oh my god
we got this intense purpley magenta pink
color and a super vivid intense yellow
color they come in a bunch of neutral
colors also they have this one right
here which is called sequin um I mean
hello and I haven't heard anyone talk
about this fact yet but they feel creamy
so they're definitely not a dry eye
shadow they're more sort of like a
creamy buttery texture and not like a
mattes buttery they're actual cream oh
the doorbell just rang out my camera my
new camera
didn't call my name that means the way
care is still out here we'll never get
dusty Perkins see our YouTube made me
buy a new camera for selfies and I'm
desperately waiting for it and it's
still not here and every time the
doorbell rings I'm like okay great next
product next hit is by Tarte and the
Tarte Amazonian clay tinted brow gel to
be exact it's the taupe it's in the
color taupe and when I first found out
about this on the internet I people did
put out that it was a small brush but I
would have never expected that the head
the brush head of this brow gel this is
barely existent
it is so tiny it is so thin which makes
it the best brow gel ever so the brush
of this brow gel is the tiniest I have
ever experienced which makes it so
perfect because here comes the
explanation part what I hate about my
brows is that the front part of my brows
the hairs are really sparse they're like
4 hairs they're on so when I fill it in
I automatically get this gradient effect
and I do not always want a gradient
effect so with this I can actually brush
the few hairs that I actually got which
makes them more prominent and more
they're making the the gradient effect
the ombre effect a less visible making
it look more like actual hairs it's just
an amazing tiny precise brow gel and the
color is great it has a great coverage
and it keeps the hair into place this
should be it it's just lazy
ok next product is by bourgeois and it's
the contour clubbing waterproof eye
pencil in taupe on top and this is a
really pretty high shine almost Chrome
taupe color and I love this for when I
have these basic smoky eyes and I apply
this to my lower lash line to get that
shine going it's just great as an
eyeshadow base it's great as a touch of
chrome taupe along the lash line it's I
oh it's one of the best pencils I have
ever tried and it is so soft so
pigmented I barely touched my skin wait
I'm barely touching my skin and booyah a
quick throw in there
liquid gold payment by makeup geek is
amazing calm because it's such an
unusual color and it's so pretty and
perfect and I I'm doing it I'm doing it
I'm not doing it I'm using an in a
tutorial soon so keep your eyes out for
that but I love this pigment okay last
but not least I want to talk about the
fact that on sunscreen my face up
and it pisses me off so I came back from
Mexico and my skin looked so bad and I
actually had to film a tutorial right
after my Thanksgiving tutorial and my
skin looked horrible it looked like the
pores were open and wide and like I had
all these bumps and zits and it was a
catastrophe but then my mom of course
came with the remedy this is the Hana
Hana cleansing clay and this is a mask
and it looks like this it has a ruinous
fleshy tone not that because I said of
the color but I love this math does it
just it pulls out all the nasty gunk and
puts nice soft back in so I put this
mask on after that video because I had
to film with the day after coming back
home I kept it on for like half an hour
and it just pulled all the bumps out it
took the swelling down of the little
bumps and it just made my skin look very
clear and heavily and how it should be
so d humma cleansing clay is Baus and i
quickly do want to ask you guys for a
favor my mom and her husband are
competing in webshop of the year in
holland so their web shop has Hana has
dot NL is nominated to be Web shop of
the of the year so my little favor to
ask you is to please vote for my mom and
her husband's web shop
hey Tana has done an out I'm so proud of
them they put so much work into this Web
shop and they work on it 24/7 and I'm so
proud that they actually got nominated
and how awesome would it be if my mom
would win this one I mean how awesome
would that be so I will put the link
down below where you can vote and it
would just mean the
if you went foud and my mom would cry if
she would win oh yeah no so the first of
god no is still my eyes I want to think
I guess so much for all the advice and
tips and tricks to gave me on the last
hits and God knows it really helped a
lot because I went to my optician and we
have decided that I should go for
dailies now daily contacts and I'm
starting that somewhere this week so
hopefully that will be my Savior I did
have this random thought and it's
actually kind of scaring me is that I
used revita lash for so long and I
actually use it now and then that
somewhere in the back of my mind I'm
thinking that it's an allergic reaction
to the revita lash after like almost a
year of using it I'm not sure I haven't
applied the revita lash for a week now
and I'm planning on you know ignoring it
for the next couple of months but of
course I really don't know for sure so
I'm just leaving the rafita lash for now
umm and trying the dailies and hopefully
that will work the end girl no and my
last oh god no this month is by Mac in
the C prep and prime CC cream in adjust
and I finally started you know warming
up to the thought of BB creams and I
started loving BB creams and BB creams
started to take over my heart a little
bit so I was like okay I've made it with
the Mimi creams after three years now
let's go to the CC creams so I thought
Mac I love Mac as a brand and I love Mac
products so I was like ah the Mac CC
cream should be good umm not I don't
even know why this is on the market
because it does a douche it I can't
literally put a droplet on the back of
my hand and be like oh my gosh that is
amazing it has a lovely skin tone color
it looks like it would cover up a thing
or two but once you start blending it
out and keep letting it out it just
disappears into nothing like you cannot
see it there
Shyne no color no cover rich no no there
is a smell not a good smell it's not
worth your money even if you like a
light base and you don't like foundation
this is nothing this is not even
Foundation this is not even a tinted
moisturizer it does nothing to your face
and that's it guys that concludes my
