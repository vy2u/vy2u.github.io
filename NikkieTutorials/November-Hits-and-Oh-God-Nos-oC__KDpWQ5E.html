big sweater that I have on it's really
big it's really comfortable and again if
you don't like it from now on you should
like it so today is really exciting
because today is the first hits and oh
god knows of November so this is sort of
my favourites of November hits and chits
from I call it ambrosia of November this
is sort of the juicy hits and oh God
knows of November I'm really excited for
this and let's just get right to it the
first thing that I feel loving this
month is this L'Oreal color which look
whole in number 114 lavender or breezy
lavender and this is a really bright
purple sort of blue lavender lavender
huh it's purple with the sheen of blue
and in some lights it's even more purple
and then it's blue and it's absolutely
gorgeous it's super duper pigmented it's
soft it stays on it's not perfect for on
your waterline because it is gonna
transfer and stuff but I really like it
then even more pencils that I really
really love are the NYX skate on white
slide on glide on stay on and definitely
a turn-on waterproof extreme shine
eyeliner what the hell were you thinking
NYX despite the name these are amazing
they are super duper waterproof they are
pigmented they stay on like a dream and
the colors are amazing I have a few more
but this is the brown wait let me brown
black which the black is really black
they glide on without any problem that's
the copper these are absolutely amazing
and they say on your waterline for hours
I'm wearing the brown one on my
waterline right now and I absolutely
love it so if I could really recommend
eye calls that are cheap Nick slide on
and then the rest what they say and the
l'oreal one
I really good but the Loreal is not
really for on your waterline then a new
fount love this month was ember Lights
eyeshadow by Mac I've had this for years
probably since I started using makeup
and I kind of rediscovered it this month
because I work at Mill uni Oz and I do
the girls with the with the with the
prizes and their coffers offer girls and
I'm in the team to do makeup and amber
lights is sort of like the go-to color
that I use for my girls because it kind
of really suits every girl that I have
so I've been using my lights a lot
lately and I used it in my Taylor Swift
am a 2012 look that I uploaded a couple
of days ago and I just love this color
it's warm it's it's shiny it's pigmented
and it's sort of it looks good on
everybody and then sort of staying in
the gold themes
this is OPI eyes golden eye nail polish
I feel wearing this in my last couple of
videos and people have been going insane
over this in real life
people have been going insane over this
sort of everywhere I went people were
like what it's all your nose well not
like that but they really went like what
is on your nails I have to know because
it's such a glamorous color and it's so
unique I absolutely love golden eye from
the OPI Skyfall collection this is in my
eyes the best one from the entire
collection so get it while you can then
also want to show you my favorites from
the China Glaze
Cirque de Soleil worlds away collection
this collection is so much fun because
it has all these bright colors that
kinda anyone loves and I'm wearing the
bright pink right now and this is called
escaping reality so this is what is on
me right now they also have it's a
trapeze the trapeze
it's a trapeze it's like an ice cream
glitter in in a pot I absolutely love
this and I also really really love
creative fantasy this is like a really
bright purple but feel dark and you
don't see that a lot like a really dark
purple but it's bright and I love that
also what I've been loving this month is
I did a shoot with Bianca toups from
section milcom and we
did the session milk 3.0 shoot I've done
two before and we did the class of 2012
it was sort of like for stereotypical
girls so we had the babe the bitch and
we had the rebel and we had the cutie
it's even the background of my phone I
love it that much so I have a full blog
post on this on my website called naked
tutorials calm and I has a full blog
post with every picture and I sort of
describe why I chose each look and what
sort of highlight products I used for
each look so definitely go check that
out on my blog and a link is down below
that have also been loving the walking
dead and American Horror Story this
month my perfect show this month The
Walking Dead really has stepped up their
game since season 3 um you know with two
really big persons people person people
dying and next week is the season for
like the mid-season finale and for me
the mid-season finales of The Walking
Dead is it's like the episode where the
most people die and when you cry the
most so I fully like mentally preparing
for this Sunday already and then
American Horror Story is batshit crazy
and I absolutely love everything about
it like we have the guy that takes off
skin and everything is amazing this
season of American Horror Story and
Walking Dead are perfection then a
couple days ago I went to the movie
sinister with my best friend and that
was it was really good except for I
didn't really really love the end but I
really loved sinister when I saw the
trailer a couple of months ago I was so
like even the trailer scared me to
there was this part where there was like
a really big shock and then me and my
friend we kind of screamed like we
literally went like yeah and then we
sort of started like a scream wave like
we started the scream and then the
entire audience that was watching
sinister when like so I was like oh my
god you know that movie when there's
like this person totally trying to make
people clap for something that's
happened and people are like stop
clapping it's not the right moment I
don't know what movie that is and this
is sort of like I started a screw
then my best friend followed and then
the entire audience followed so it kind
of went like that it was really funny I
was like inside my head I was like oh my
god I started a scream wave I can die
now goodbye my favorite youtuber this
month is dusty Oh Hunter dusty Oh Hunter
is like the the king of refuse and and
sort of making people buy stuff his
reviews are the best and with Halloween
hat this amazing series this guy just
screams intelligence and I look up to
him and he started following me on
Twitter like today and I'm so proud of
myself that dusty hunter is following me
he's a great guy he's amazing and you
best believe it's gonna be flamin
then I didn't really have a lot of Oh
God knows this month but I had a couple
and um here we go oh yeah no the first
oh god no is the no mirror makeup
challenge just no it's just I'm so over
this challenge and no just no and girl
no the second oh god no is the Acela
want to shake laughs touch my clit it it
didn't touch my clip it just never did
it's people are raving about this as if
it's like they're holy real concealer
and someone forgot to mention that it's
not a concealer it's just a highlighter
and it's not a really pretty highlighter
and every time I use it I'm like you
can't even see it
nope no just no and then the less oh God
knows from this month are and this
breaks my heart
The Vampire Diaries and revenge two of
my all-time favorite shows the new
seasons they're kind of like what is
happening I don't understand
especially revenge I am a huge revenge
lover you all know how much I love
season 1 season 1 heck cliffhangers it
had really interesting storylines and
everything was kind of anything could
happen and this season 2 we're at seven
or eight now and I'm just like same goes
for the Vampire Diaries
I am I know this is going to hurt a lot
of people and it hurts my heart a little
bit as well I'm kind of over it it's I
love love love this show and I was
totally obsessed with the show I wanted
to be in the show and now I'm like Elena

still care for our Lexie she's dead and
