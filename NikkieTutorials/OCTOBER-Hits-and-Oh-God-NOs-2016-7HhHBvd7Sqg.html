I should stop doing that hi guys today
I'm bringing you my October hit
synagogue nose after all the Halloween
craziness I'm still looking like a
Halloween creature I mean it's it's
tough it's tough when you've been so
Halloween focused and then Halloween is
over and you fall in this black hole of
like what do I do with my face I decided
to ease out of Halloween by doing this
peach goddess princess makeup look yeah
but I hope you enjoyed all my Halloween
makeup tutorials and I know I know I
have to get back to this I said that I
had all this time for Halloween
tutorials which turned out I didn't I
was super busy with projects and
traveling and I managed to get four out
instead of six so I think it did pretty
good
because usually I only do two but yeah
please remind me next year April June to
start pre recording the Halloween
tutorial so I have them already in
October but you're here I am because of
all the traveling and October's
Halloween festivities I haven't really
been able to try a whole lot of new
products I did manage to find out about
a couple of new products that I am
totally obsessed with but I'm gonna be
honest it isn't like my usually long
list of loves it's it's it's a shorter
one which is okay see if without any
further ado if you would like to know my
October hits and God knows then please
keep on watching all right let's get
down and dirty let's get into it the
first hit of this month of October was
the COPE re coconut melt now when you
follow me on snapchat which is naked
tutorials at me I have been talking
about this product um last month in the
beginning of October and I got this
because one of my favorite makeup
artists Priscilla
Ohno uses this on herself and on clients
and what you use it this for is to
hydrate your under eyes for especially
if you're a fan of baking which be
honest here I love baking baking has the
tendency to make your under eyes
look a little dry and crusty and this
helps really moisturize and soothe them
when you're not wearing makeup so use
this in my skincare routine this is my
final and last step I take just the
tiniest bit just you need the tiniest
bit ever and I just gently massage it
underneath my eyes and it makes my under
eyes feel really hydrated and taken care
of and and moisturized and after a
couple of weeks like two to three weeks
I did notice a huge difference with my
under eyes when I baked wearing makeup
because it just looked all so much more
healthy and less crusty and nasty so
it's working it's doing what Priscilla
told me it would do I'm going to be real
with you this is a very big jar and
literally I don't think I can ever
finish this jar in my life because I'm
using this for a month straight every
day this is what happened that is like
nothing literally honestly all you have
to do is put your finger in here go back
and forth like three times that's enough
for both your eyes Priscilla also told
me this is great to break down liquid
lipsticks with this for if you have like
a really really intense one that you
cannot get off and you wanted to break
down on your lips you massage this over
top let it sit for a little bit and it
will break down the product and you can
wipe it right off but this has been
amazing for my under eyes and whenever I
have like really dry patches I just
massage it in and you need the tiniest
amount so if I can be like 100% real
with you do not get this big jar you
don't need it you won't finish it go for
a little jar you have more than enough
next up really quickly
Julia's plays newbie and eyeshadow
palette I know I talked about this
before like two months ago but this
palette has been my Holy Grail I cannot
put it down it is my neutrals dream it
looks like this it has everything a
neutral heart desires it is so
affordable like crazy affordable and it
was out of stock for a long time so back
in stock and this is my obsession and my
everything and I just I just wanted to
put that out there again okay okay my
next hit is something I've put off
telling you for a couple of months now
I've been using this for a long time but
it's like kind of awkward to talk about
it so my
wearing a wig obviously I am not the
most confident person with my hairline I
am super blonde so right at the edge of
my hairline my hair is like super super
light blonde so I have hair there it
just looks bald because it's the same
color as my skin tone so that is
something a little bit awkward to me
because it makes it look like I have
like like things like bald spots um oh
my god I was so awkward telling you
about this but I I was watching a video
on YouTube and someone went well I'm
gonna use this hair shadow I was like
what wait wallet this is an Asian hair
product and it's called the 3c II style
nanda hairline shadow in the color
natural ash I got this off of Amazon and
it looks like this it comes with three
colors a more blondish warm color an
ashy color and a super dark ashy color
comes with this brush which is perfect
and whenever I'm wearing my natural hair
or wearing my hair up where you can see
like the line of my hairline what I will
do is grab this color right here the
center one tap the brush in it and just
at the line I will color the hairs and
fill in blank spots to make it look full
unless just an amazing and um and it's
been a little bit of a secret of mine
because people have been like wow your
hair line has been looking so OnPoint
lately and I'm like it's a shadow so
yeah it feels a little bit weird for me
to talk about it like that but it's been
an insecurity of mine and for a hair
shadow to completely change my way of
thinking about my hair line and just it
makes me feel so much more comfortable
and I love that that's why I love makeup
that's why I love cosmetics because they
make you feel good when you want them to
you um so I highly recommend this it
lasts all day long and it's untraceable
you can't see it no one has ever clocked
me like no one ever went oh my god you
have hair shadow on so I'm in love with
this I highly recommended it isn't too
expensive I got it off of Amazon I'll
put a link down below
but I'm obsessed a lipstick I've been
wearing for like weeks straight like
this would be my only lip option is the
Charlotte Tilbury Kim kW lipstick now I
got this because of Jeffrey and this
color is such a stunning nude it is so
beautiful it just it flatters my skin
tone so much it is nude but not deadly
nude it has that little touch of pink
and peach that makes it so cute and
flirty and beautiful and I love the
packaging it's rose gold it looks so
vintage and cute and amazing and this
color I've been obsessed with it it goes
with every look it goes with smoky eyes
winged eyeliner glitter eyes it goes
with bare eyes natural eyes no I
it honestly goes with every look
whenever I'm traveling this is the
lipstick I bring with me because I know
it will go with everything and it will
make me look good and make me feel
comfortable and confident and that is
what I'm looking for in the lipstick it
doesn't dry out my lips it has a
beautiful luscious glossy finish but it
lasts and I highly recommend it plus she
has a lot of colors now onto another
lipstick now when I want my lips to be
deadly nude but like still fierce I have
been falling in love with this lazy
Lullaby lipstick by Mac this is like a
grey pale deadly lavender and I don't
really use it on its own I love pairing
this with Kim kW it just makes it look
so beautifully nude and like I wouldn't
wear this alone I wouldn't really
recommend it on its own because it might
look a little bit weird and deadly but I
love using this color to kind of cancel
out the richness of my lips I have super
pigmented red lips and that is not
always the look I want to go for and I
find that this lipstick right here
really helps cancel out all the color to
create a clean canvas or whatever you
put on top and when I put this one over
top it's just dream dream team
dream team let's talk about a brush
that's always with me when I wear my
makeup throughout the day and I need to
be able to touch up this brush right
here this is by Sephora this is the
Pro Press full coverage precision number
67 brush and it has a weird chip it's
kind of like a a Beautyblender shape
wait hold on do you see that it kind of
looks like a beautiful under what I
Presley use it for and let's get so real
right now
put like in the edges of my nose like
right up in there I get super oily and
my makeup tends to move there and with
this brush I grab a little bit of powder
and go right up in there and I brought I
go right up in there and I mattify it
and set it into place and I think it's
the perfect brush for that it's just an
amazing dense brush that gets the
product on there but it has the ability
to beautifully transfer it into the skin
and make it look stunning stunning it's
a beautiful brush I have like three of
them concealer powder touch-up brush
it's an amazing brush it's affordable
because it's Sephora brand and I'm upset
okay
morphe came out with pressed pigments
and the colors are just magical so let
me show you my absolute favorite now
this is why I love it it's a pressed
pigment so it's super pigmented it will
do whatever you wanted to do it has
coverage it is velvety it is shockingly
beautiful and it's it's it's amazing the
lightest color they have is called
champagne nights
Noureddine I want to go the safe
champagne nights is a beautiful
highlighter I'm wearing it as my glow
today and I'm sorry but can we just all
take a second to admire that blinding
Ness it has a pinky duochrome so the
base is a beautiful light white pinkish
champagne --is-- color and then the
sheen of it the duochrome of it is like
a vibrant pink so that gives it that
really cool effect where it has a pink
shine to it
it is duochrome realness you only need
the tiniest that when you swatch it for
you ah so there's a bunch of colors that
you can actually use as a highlighter as
a blinding glow as well and I think for
the price that's amazing because you get
an eye shadow and highlighter in one
favor yourself for like six dollars
I quickly want to show you some other
colors I love
this color right here is called untamed
this is the color that is on my lids
today I'm sorry
crazy pigment like so easy to work with
they have minimal fallout they feel very
velvety and soft I can talk about these
for oh I love this color called
richly made isn't this fall in an
eyeshadow this one is called richly made
up and it looks like that oh good
alright and I am pretty sure that that
are all the products I have to show you
this month like I said it's a shorter
list because I've been so Halloween
minded and traveling but it's a good
list it's a good list and now let's turn
over to Anat cyclists oh yeah no my
first
oh god no of October has been the
Lancome this one right here this one is
called absolute oh my god okay Lister
absolute Lextran NextEra mmm boom elixir
you Lancome I bomb a waxer this stuff
right here cost me a fortune
this little part right here although you
don't need a lot let me tell you this
this little pot right here cost me like
two hundred and sixty dollars uh-huh and
it comes with a kit it has I it has like
an eye mask patch thing to help
moisturize but I've tried this for three
weeks and it did nothing sometimes we
use a product and it's really expensive
you your brain is almost like telling
you it's doing something so you start
seeing things but then when you look
back in reality you're like that did
nothing so use this for three weeks
before I knew about the cap re coconut
melt for my under eyes and for three
weeks my life was the lie I was like oh
my god this is totally working and it
did nothing
it honestly did nothing it's just like
smearing on a really expensive nothing
okay so this oh god no you have to take
the so garden with a little grain of
salt because well okay there's a story
behind these
these colour-pop highlighters recently
came out they have a green they have a
pinkish beautifulness and they have a
blue so when I try things on my snapchat
I was like okay there's nothing okay so
I'm going to show you the pinky one
watch what well if the light gets it
nicely there is something to be seen but
it's like the product first of all feels
very waxy and um silicon II and I feel
like I put this over top of my makeup
and it kind of moved my foundation so it
made it look really patchy and nasty
like I expressed my opinion on snapchat
thinking oh my god why would you buy
something so sheer and not blinding
because I love my blinding glow so
people then informed me that these are
meant as transformers so you put your
regular highlighter on and you can
bounce these over top to give them
either a pinkish feel a greenish feel or
a blueish feel but first of all anybody
got time for that I mean I get I get it
I get why they are made like that but
ain't nobody got time for that
but again take it with a little grain of
salt because if you really build these
up you can make a more intense but for
me the consistency if formula gets too
waxy and too
silicone II and it starts moving the
product underneath so for me the more I
build it up the Messier and uglier it
gets and I'm not about that soft subdued
highlight game so for me these are no
but please and I can't stress this
enough whatever works for me may not
work for you or whatever works for you
may not work for me and I think makeup
and cosmetics and skincare is of such a
personal game it always bugs me when I
don't like a certain product and another
youtubers obsessed with it and then
people start thinking either of us is
lying and no makeup as a personal game
you like it or you don't something works
for you or doesn't and that's
just how the cookie crumbles and with
that I am NOT a fan of the color pop
highlighters but you may be obsessed
with them and I think we have to respect
that so for me it's the pass and that's
it those were all the hits and oh god
