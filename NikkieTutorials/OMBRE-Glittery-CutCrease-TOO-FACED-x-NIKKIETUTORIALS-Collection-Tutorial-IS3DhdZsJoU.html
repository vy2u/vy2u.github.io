featuring my power of makeup collection
with Too Faced and this is actually
really really crazy but tomorrow this is
going to launch tomorrow is the day
where we release this collection for all
of you to get it and for all of you to
fall in love with it like I did and
tomorrow is the day this is so crazy to
me the main questions I still got after
my previous video revealing it all where
exactly is this palette going to be
available at what time will it launch
tomorrow and I put all that information
in the description box below so if you
want to know exactly where you can
snatch one of these up in stores or
online and when I will put it all down
in the description box plus on my
snapchat I will keep you up to date on
the latest updates and whatever is
happening so make sure you acne advocate
tutorials also quick tip major key we
are expecting a lot of traffic and to
higher your chances of getting your
hands on this collection what I did was
in the description box I put some direct
links to the product page both for
Sephora Too Faced calm and Ulta and if
you click those links it will take you
directly to the page where you can
purchase the power of makeup and this
way you can save some time by clicking
through all other pages and you higher
your chances of getting the power of
makeup collection so basically all the
information you still need on the launch
of this collection will be in the
description box below today I created
this super glam cut crease ombre makeup
look perfect for a party perfect you
kind of make a powder in half with your
eyeliner it's just a very fun glittery
festive party look oh yeah I created the
super fun glam look using the two-faced
power of makeup collection to show you
another way of using this in a very
different manner now last time with all
the purples and that's it without any
further ado if you would like to know
how to get this party glam cut crease
ombre makeup look featuring the power of
makeup which is launching tomorrow
please
you for watching alright so let's get
this glam look started I'm gonna dip my
Beauty Blender in one of my favorite
moisturizers and I'm gonna pick it up on
that Beauty Blender and with this I'm
going to moisturize my skin and what
this will do is of course this will prep
your face for a foundation to make
everything go on smoothly and
beautifully
I'm just the way you want it but also
because you're applying that foundation
with your Beauty Blender your Beauty
Blender will absorb some of that
moisturizer and then once you start
using it for your foundation it's going
to mix in and create this lovely blend
of a nourishing foundation and that will
make your foundation go in even more
beautiful it will just melt into the
skin so nicely it's one of my favorite
tricks to just transform a foundation
into Photoshop skin for foundation today
I'm going to go in with Too Faced Born
This Way and I always use the color snow
and pearl I mix them together to get the
perfect match and with that same Beauty
Blender start dabbing it on to the skin
for concealer today I'll be going in
with the tart shaped tape concealer in
fair and to make it even lighter and I'm
go in with Kat Von D's a cream concealer
in white out the the Tarte
I'm really going to highlight with this
as well because this is a very glam look
and the wideout just mixed into the tart
one just dotting it in and same
Beautyblender and we're going to bounce
that in I using mine are soft velvet
loose powder and snow I'm going to bake
my under-eye area as always the first
thing I'll be doing is priming my
eyelids using my Mac soft ochre Paint
Pot and using Ivy I'm going to set my
brow bone to crease area to help
blending later on with the two-faced
sketch marker in black which is included
in the kit I'm first going to map out
the outer shape of the eye from there
with a precise angle brush I'm picking
up the dark black from the palette
called wanted and just shaping out that
outer corner and filling the outer third
in with that same brush and same color
picking up some makeup and chill and
with this I'm going to blend from the
black onto the lid and this is going
mainly on the center of the lid blending
in with that black now picking a pink
color and blending that right next to
makeup and chill
going back in with ivy and really
highlighting the inner third and inner
corners now going to pick up makeup and
chill and I'm going to create a new
crease and make sure you leave a little
bit of room for some glitter with
painkiller and makeup in chill and a
fine liner brush I'm going to blow and
blend that out even more and because
it's such a small area and it can be a
little tricky to blend it out what i
like to do is place that pie liner brush
flat onto my skin and with short strokes
kind of drag it up to create a blend you
can always go back in with makeup and
chill only Andry intensify the base of
that new crease as a base for the
glitter and to make the glitter go on
even sparkly err I'm going to grab Urban
Decay's heavy metal glitter in glam rock
and this is going right in between those
two lines and quickly setting it with
the glitter from the kit
with the sketch mark liner I'm creating
a basic wing
for the bottom I'm taking makeup and
chill and buffing it on the outer
corners of my lower lash line and with
painkiller I'm just continuing defining
my lower lash line somewhat I call on
the waterline and with a white liner I'm
placing a little wide dot on the inner
corners of my eyes and to finish this
look off all I'm going to do is apply
some lashes these are goddess lashes by
Koko lashes alright for cheeks the first
going to cut them using my Kevan Daquan
medium sculpting powder
and with a zoeva 142 intensify the base
of the contour and blend it out and then
grab your face powder and your face
brush and go right underneath to clean
the line around it and even ride over
top of the base of the contour to soften
it that will give you a really
airbrushed perfect contour finish for
blush I'm going to go into my power of
makeup palette and mixing both blushes
for a beautiful pinky coral and for a
killer glow today I'll be using
sugar-coated from the palette this
unfair skin tone as a highlighter is oh
hi there now this is the stuff I live
for okay let's not forget about that
nose for lips I first going to apply Tom
Ford nude vanilla because this nude is
just it works with everything and I
think the eyes are so special though I
want all the attention to go to here
and then over top I'll be applying the
Oprah metallic liquid lipstick in
Versailles
and to finish you want to lock this all
in place with a setting spray and I'll
be using the Ofra makeup fixer and that
