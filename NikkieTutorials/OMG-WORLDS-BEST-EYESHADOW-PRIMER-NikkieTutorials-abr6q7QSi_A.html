today I am trying something that I've
been wanting to try for the longest time
one of my favorite makeup accounts on
Instagram P Louise at makeup Academy
came out with her own eye primer and not
just eye primer also an eyeshadow
palette she came up with hottest fire
it's it's right here normally I would be
like oh my god let's focus on the
palette and let's have some fun but this
base we really we really need to talk
about this base right now P Louise is
known for starting the Mac select cover
up concealer trend a lot of people have
been using Mac select cover-up as a base
for their shadows without setting it
usually you grab your base whether it be
a concealer or whatever and then you put
translucent powder on top none o P
Louise has taught us to put the silica
virap concealer on and then leave it as
is and then go straight in with your
shadows it shook the world but she said
that Mac select cover-up is a little bit
too drying and a little bit too draggy
what would happen was eyeshadows will
look a little bit Skippy not until today
probably because P Louise has come up
with her own base it started off being
called the rumor because she was working
on it and it was a rumor that she was
working on it but here it finally is I
cannot even tell you how excited I am to
try this
listen coming from the girl who has used
soft ochre Paint Pot for six years of
her life coming from the girl who then
went on to select cover-up but thought
it was a little bit Skippy I am more
than excited for this one I can't wait
to see how this applies how it settles
how it works with shadows it's just I'm
just I'm really excited my main issue is
my eyes tend to crease really fast if it
isn't a good primer so today I'm gonna
put it to the test I'm gonna put it on
on-camera then work with shadows over
top to see how shadows apply how they
blend how how's the pigmentation on him
and then I'm gonna put it to the test I
am going to a commercial shoot later
today here at Holland this is my first
commercial and I feel so bougie she's
saying it but I'm doing the commercial
I'm low-key really nervous and I really
want to put this to the test it's going
to be a long night
we'll see if I crease this is probably
not the best stage tried to sound effect
crease my commercials ruined yeah
without a further ado if you want to
know if the P Louise bass is the best
eyeshadow primer
of the world let's find out okay so
welcome up-close-and-personal to my face
booth I apply primer foundation
concealer powder and brows it's a lot I
know and as you can see the concealer on
my eyes has creased dramatically like
it's bad it's I take full responsibility
for what you're looking at right now as
you can see I need a primer that does
increase because if I don't apply a
primer this is what happens to my
shadows and we don't want that you don't
want to put so much love and effort into
your creation to let it be ruined
like that so here we have the P Louise
base and Paige
Oh her name is Paige Paige Louise and
she always applies it with a sack a sack
a Mac 252 brush here we go so taking the
lid off and then okay okay it is colored
a little bit apricot e peachy it's a
little apricot you see that peachy
apricotty undertone my undertone is
death so this might add a little bit of
warmth to my lid okay so I'm gonna put
the brush into the she thick this is a
thick primer it's got coverage for I
feel like and covered my tattoos with
this so it's very thick and well not
thick in a bad way it's very opaque and
the base feels a little bit more rich
than Mac select cover up concealer so
max like cover up concealer is very thin
and consistency this feels very dense so
the trick that Paige always uses is
tapping in the primer so you don't want
to swipe it on like a paint you want to
tap tap-tap that base to set it so this
is what we're gonna do I'm gonna tap the
base on and by tapping it you're also
setting it so I'm starting off on my lid
that's that's got coverage and then I'm
working my way up into the inner corner
up into the Brad loan get it nice and
even on there
I'm gonna wipe my brush off and tap out
the edges to make it blend out nicely
okay Wow
so I'm noticing that it dries quicker
than I thought
firm otherwise it's so rich that my
first initial fright was that it was
never gonna set because the concealers
never set on me I always have to set
them with a powder so seeing how thick
and dense this consistency was I was
like oh my god that's never gonna said
I'm gonna crease and that is my lid
primed - oh my god that's got so like
any discoloration gone I feel secure and
like someone's taking care of me
you're gonna grab a little bit more and
then focus on the other eye and then
let's see by the time I'm done with the
other eye if this I started creasing I'm
done tapping in this side of the primer
and looking really up-close and personal
I see no creasing on the other eye so
this is very promising there's a little
bit of oxidization going on because of
this the the sides kind of turned a
little bit more warm on me that's fine I
can live with that I'm gonna bounce that
a laser if I should have over top
anyways alright so now is the true test
how do I shadows react to this base so
I'm going in with a pea Louise palette
it's such a beautiful palette like Hello
she did that and because I'm shooting a
commercial I want to keep things a
little bit more on the commercial side
like I don't want to scare people away
from the TV just yet
maybe my second commercial of Luckies
but for this look I want to keep things
a little bit more soft a little bit more
natural but we can still see how I
should have perform on it so I'm going
in with I first want to go in with this
shimmery shade right here called Prynne
to highlight the brow bone okay so print
on the
oh well I can't really say much about
you know playing eyeshadow on the the
brow bone because you can't really mess
that up so let's focus on the crease for
the outer corner and the cruising on a
grab latte and with latte I'm just gonna
define and see I just want to see that
that first boom of pigments alright so I
always apply my shadows in a tapping
motion and first I love and then I want
to work my way up into that crease and
blend it out
I feel like that bass really grabs the
shadow and it's like okay we're doing
this you want pigment here you go when
it comes to blending I feel like
sometimes the bass can feel a little bit
it's really hard to explain it almost
feels like there's a little bit of grip
to it and probably because that primer
is so rich I feel like sometimes I have
to put a little bit more pressure on a
freshly primed part like it's hard to
explain I feel my brush start of getting
a little bit restricted from moving
freely because the primer is a little
bit more sticky but as soon as you'd go
through that stickiness it's very smooth
and blending is really easy I don't know
does that make sense
but it's only like for example I don't
feel that any more right here
but if I would move towards here it's
still tacky there so I would feel that
resistance on my brush I want to go in
with the tiniest bit of this ochre a
yellowy color called P Louise and just
to buff out the edges a little bit and
give it a little bit more warmth okay so
this is what it's starting to look like
and it's just blending without any
trouble like just what I said we have a
little bit of persistence on the brush
when it's tacky at first but then as
soon as you go through that it just
blends like a dream and it's starting to
crease a little bit it's a little bit
worrisome so I'm just gonna grab the
brush again and tap out that crease and
pray to God that it does increase
towards the end of the day I want to
apply this shade right here slay on the
lid this base is I think perfect for if
you want maximum coverage and
pigmentation out of your shadow it's
like a magnet it just grabs the shadow
and takes out every little bit of
pigment out of it that it can oh this is
a soft very glam look that is like you
think I'm using no I'm not cuz like I
you think I'm simple no look at all the
blending I put into this anyways moving
on to an inner corner
highlights gonna go in with the white
and also blending it a little bit with
that brow bone highlight because I want
it to be a little bit more shimmery the
own like like I said the only thing
that's worrying me River only thing that
is a little bit worrisome is that it
crease a little bit just now but only
time can tell care for the bottom I'm
just applying a little bit of that latte
again you know include that lower lash
line a little bit with the top so I'm
feeling pretty confident with the look
right now I'm gonna do the other eye and
apply some lashes and probably the rest
of my face and then we'll have a final
verdict right after applying it will not
find / - just a Midford no
like that alright so here's my look I am
ready for my commercial shoot so this is
what the eye shadow looks like using the
P Lewis base and the P Lewis palette
we're gonna put this base to the test
how long will this hold up will increase
will it fade how will this perform this
is what the shadow looks like really up
close and personal as you can see the
blend is pretty damn nice if I do say so
myself
so far my first impressions are really
really good so yeah initial thoughts
let's see how this performs alright guys
so it just got back from the commercial
shoot and I had a lot of fun and I was
in the cold I was in the heat so it was
a lot of interaction with the client
what does that mean so I really put the
base to the test because we've been
wearing it for seven hours now and if
you ask me I don't see any fading that
nail though it doesn't look washed out
to me it doesn't look crazy to me so for
me it's looking very good this is what
it looks like seven hours after
finishing up so there you go and that
pretty much proves to me that this
eyeshadow base can take care of the
world so most people the tone of this
will be lighter than their skin tone
this has a little bit of a warm tone to
it which is fine because you can't
really see it in the end my only concern
is that this might turn out a little bit
ashion deep skin tones but I also want
to say with that that I have seen a lot
of dark skinned beauty gurus out there
uses on the Instagram and it works just
fine and it looks beautiful so I'll let
you decide on that I think they should
come out with another tone for deeper
skin tones
yeah shadows when they're really nicely
on it after that that a little bit of
resistance but it just it looks nice it
stays looking nice and to me this is
better than select cover-up by Mac
because I like cover-up by Mac makes my
lids very dry I think this is an
absolute go this is an absolute yes I
highly recommend it I think it is right
now the best base
i base of the world you will definitely
see me use this a lot more on my channel
this will probably the only eye base
you'll see a much handle from that one
and I want to share the love I have a
lot of these right here like literally
it has a lot and I want to give these
away so if you would like to win a P
