the highly requested OPI Nicki Minaj
collection nail polishes when I showed
one of the polishes in my update video I
believe you guys went crazy and you all
wanted to know everything about this
collection said today I'm gonna show you
everything about the Nicki Minaj
collection of opie I am going to show
you swatches but I think of them
normally I do this stuff on my block on
Nicki's royals.com
I make a blog post and I make a review
on the nail polish and I make photos and
what I think of them and which are my
favorites of a collection so if you want
to see more nail polish reviews and more
photos then go to my website new
tutorials calm that is where all the
magic is I list all Prague's there and
stuff like that for tutorials as well so
umm let's go so in this collection the
following colors are pink Friday and
this is the same name as Nicki Minaj's
album fly I would describe this as a
really nice bright teal aqua color did
it on him this is a chartreuse a light
bright chartreuse save me and this I
already showed you in my update video
this is a stunner if you look closely to
the side you can see that the base is a
really nice silver infused with blue
glitter in it then here I got my
favorite this is metallic for life this
is black glitter infused with bright
silver glitters this is pure heaven then
last but definitely not least we got the
super base shadow topcoat this is a
really nice very toned base infused with
really bright purple glitters okay so
I'm gonna start off with pink Friday
pink Friday is this really beautiful I
would like to call it a baby pink a
really dolly Barbie baby pink I have
never really seen a bright baby pink and
I am pale as hell as you know I really
really like skin toned and this really
pops on my skin so I could've met
and is going crazy on darker skin or tan
skin this this is a color that probably
suits everyone in this entire world for
being Friday I only had to use two coats
but they were on the thicker side than
the thinner side I like working with
thicker coats anyways because that kind
of gets the job done earlier and faster
and stuff next is to color fly and fly
is a really bright aqua teal color I
must be honest I do not wear colors like
this because it's a little bit too happy
for me and a little bit too much but I
won't wear this on my toes like in the
summer or spring but not on my
fingernails also with this one
application was gorgeous I only needed
two thicker coats and then I was done
just a top coat on top to really make me
shine and I like fly but just not on my
finger nails then next I have did it on
them this is a bright as chartreuse lime
green color again I wouldn't wear this
on my finger nails I won't read this on
my toes like so much like every two or
three weeks but it's a little bit too
much for me for all my finger nails I do
like the color and again with
application I only need a to thicker
coat so that's brilliant so the cream
finish wise they only need it like two
thicker coats and some three if it was a
little bit uneven but I like this color
but again I wouldn't wear it on my
finger nails then one of the beauties in
this collection is save me and I showed
you this in my update video and you guys
went crazy over this this is gorgeous it
is a silver glitter base infused with
blue glitter as well and then you got
these long 3d 3d effect strokes in it
when I use this color alone I need it
four to five coats of this that is
insane that is way too much so I suggest
putting a darker gray underneath to
really make it pop the color is to die
for the color is amazing but I just
don't really like that you need four to
five codes for this the
College does dry really really quickly
because it is a glitter so the four to
five coats are doable timewise but it's
just I don't want to sit here and put
five layers on my fingernails it's just
way too much that my favorite of this
collection is metallic for life this
screams my name this is a black base a
black jelly base infused with small
silver glitter big silver glitter like
mega big silver glitter it's insane and
it is so sparkly so beautiful when using
this alone and you get three coats which
was kind of a mess to work with because
the glitter really pile on top and then
you get this really uneven finish but
what I suggest is putting a black polish
underneath and then add one to two coats
of this and that will really make it go
on smooth and it will it will just be
more opaque and more pretty and it's
just way better removing is a pain
though because it's glitter I do suggest
getting the Sephora Express nail polish
removers it's like you're going to an
alien vagina really if it are like
pillows and those pillows are soaked
with nail polish remover and you just
like do this in it I don't know how it
happens but the nail polish just goes
off this is called super base shatter
this is another crackle polish I must
say the color of this is amazing and
just push it what's in a shatter because
shadows are so overdone every single
company in this world has done a shatter
by now and I'm kind of over the crackle
effect other than that it's a really
good crackle it crackles all the way up
and it's a good crackle it's a pretty
crackle so if you're still obsessed with
crackles and you want a nice purple
shimmery do a chroma crackle this is the
superbe shatter and it's perfect for
that if you would ask me what colors
would you buy personally I would buy of
course metallic for life
I would buy pink Friday and of course a
green these are the three that I would
buy in an instant without even thinking
about it I live in a nail
so I don't really know how much they
retail in America or anywhere else but
here in the Netherlands they sell for I
believe 1295 per Polish but other than
that I really like this collection it's
a fun collection is a bright collection
you can play with the collection I love
you Minaj and let her like her
promotional shot but damn Nikki those
lashes really that's probably it I don't
know what to say anymore and I think you
guys so much for watching for a list of
all the names goes through my website
because tutorials calm and photos as
well and hopefully I will see you guys
in my next video I wouldn't say tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
