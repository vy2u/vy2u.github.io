time for a very very late October hits
and a god knows I know it's been forever
since my latest hits and God knows this
last month has been so insane I went to
LA twice in two weeks I went to Mexico
to do hair and makeup for the swim coach
shoots and now I finally back home but
tomorrow I'm leaving for Minneapolis to
meet you guys at the Sigma
meet-and-greet and this will go up after
that so it was a beautiful meeting you
so that any further ado let's go right
ahead and jump in the first product I
want to talk about is B enigma or B
nygma and I got this because of our
lovely girl Trisha Paytas here on
YouTube hey Trisha hi so be enigma is an
all-in-one facial cream and it contains
bee venom mm-hmm bee venom you wrote
that right manuka honey and shea butter
as I told you October has been insanely
crazy and sleep was basically not in my
life at all I slept so bad this month so
my face got all puffy my eyes got puffy
and then I saw Trisha talk about this
and she told how deep Huff's the eyes
how it tightens the face I was like yes
yes and yes it is made in New Zealand
where Shannon lives so we know it's good
and it's just an awesome all-in-one face
cream I use this in the morning to
really deep puff and tighten up my face
and oh so so good it's a very thick
moisturizing tightening cream and it
just makes your face look a little bit
more pulled and a little bit more hi
what's up now be enigma recommends that
if you have oily skin to only use it
once a day and I got combination skin so
I put a little bit more on on my dry
parts and a little bit less on my oily
parts and I only applied in the morning
but it's been so great now the only
downside this product has is that it is
expensive it retails for one hundred and
twenty-nine dollars but the enigma was
kind enough I emailed them it was like
we can't do this we need something for
my viewers so they gave me a 25%
discount code I'll put all the info down
below in the info box go check it out
there will be a link there check it out
and you can get be enigma for 25% off I
really recommend you trying it they come
in a bunch of different sizes it's
amazing you're gonna love it I love it
let's go now a little thing you should
know about Mexico is that I was the
first one to wake up every morning
because we had to do hair makeup before
the Sun came up so I woke up around 4:00
4:30 every day and then we would end the
day by jumping into the pool or the
ocean and just enjoy Mexico so from
going to the water a lot I'm blondie my
hair it's not the ideal heron you don't
want my hair and so throughout the week
I really noticed how my hair got so dry
and damaged and just my hair just not
having it I started using this Brio Gio
don't despair repair hair mask and is a
deep conditioning mask
it's a repairing mask for dry damaged or
chemically treated hair
ding-ding-ding-ding it intensely repairs
and nourishes weak hair ding ding it
contains rosehip avocado and Argan oils
and it doesn't contain any parabens
silicones or pasola Lata's what's a bath
Allah a puppet Allah two pathologists
both heaven and the first time I tried
this in Mexico I was so amazed because I
went in with the super dry damaged hair
in the shower I applied the mask from it
to ends I didn't apply to the top
because that will make you Olli I just
applied it put it in a bun did my shower
start shaving my legs and since I'm 6
foot 2 shaving legs takes a millennium
so by the time I was done I rinsed this
mask out and I dry my hair I blow-dry my
hair and my hair felt so soft and
nourished and just so healthy again I
love this mask so much and in Mexico I
met a lot of amazing people who are all
about the vegan and the natural way of
life and they liked me using this
because this is a natural product only
it contains natural products only it's
super healthy it's super grip for your
hair I highly recommended I love don't
despair
and I highly recommend you checking it
out so once I got my hair back to normal
I felt confident like letting it loose
and putting some curls and again so for
that of course my favorite was the new
me octo wand and the new me octo one
comes with ten attachable irons you
click it onto this right here it's
really easy you turn it on here you
unlock the barrel by twisting this
portion right here that way you can just
pull the barrel out and then lock it
back in by twisting that portion right
here and I've talked about new me so
many times on my channel I love new me
I love the octo wand I created my curls
with it today I love my curl today it's
a really casual soft curl soft waves
super glam but I love the octo one I
think out of all the new me products the
octo wand is my favorite and it's also
the only set I used in Mexico for all my
models it's an amazing curling hair and
I love it so much and I just really like
it because new me barrels get the job
done they keep their consistent heat and
the curls hold up in that Mexican heat
which is amazing not a lot of curling
irons can do that plus also again no me
hooked me up with a couple of discount
codes for all of you you can get an octa
one for 128 dollars plus free shipping
to Holland if you want that you got to
use the code forever Nikki and for 50%
off the entire new me website plus free
shipping to Holland excluding hair care
accessories and seasonal catalog use the
code fall with Nikki so yeah those are
some cool discount codes I have for you
this month I hope you enjoy I highly
recommend the octa wand you'll be done
with all curling areas for the rest of
your life
the only thing you'll need is a
straightening iron because it doesn't
come with one but I highly recommended
it's amazing
okay okay next up a true must for me
this past month was the lorac pro
contour palette I got this because of
Kim I got this because of her because
she told me that pretty much all of this
rocked and I use this on my Mexico shoot
week I could not live without this the
models even came up to me to tell me
they love their contour so I use the
one for my fair ladies to highlight and
set foundation with I use this one the
banana colored one if they were a little
bit more tan this was my main contour
color I'm wearing it as the contour on
my face today as well but this was the
main color that everyone was wearing as
a contour and then I would darken it up
with the medium contour and I have not
touched the dark contour color cuz that
 is just too dark if you're around
my skintone overall it's an amazing
palette and I love how the powders feel
like butter it might be my favorite out
of all of them
I love Kat Von D's I'm not in love with
the honest as I rarely hilts one when it
was good but this one is like royal some
blushes I've been absolutely loving are
by Milani and these are the ones that
have the shape of a rose in them these
are my three favorites my favorite one
is Coral Cove cuz it is so for Rickon
right and so pretty and again this video
is gonna be all about I used it in
Mexico
I use this as a pop of cheek on my
models in Mexico and they loved it and
it really sparked up the cheeks and I
really really like this color and then
the color I'm wearing is blush today is
romantic rose it's the most natural one
out of all of them and I I just love how
casually amazing this is they have
amazing color payoff they stay on all
day they're super pigmented they blend
out like a dream I'm a huge huge fan of
these Milani blushes a new foundation
combo I've been obsessing with is this
comb right here this is Make Up For Ever
Ultra HD in Y 215 believe it or not it
for once I'm not the lightest shade of
the collection and I love this because
it just makes your face look Ultra HD
perfected it almost like sometimes I'm
like it gives you a little bit of that
Photoshop feel like it feels like
someone kind of faced with the up
your face and then because I have
combination skin I mix it with the
Maybelline matte poreless foundation in
112 because I'm a little bit more tan
from Mexico now but normally on 110 I
find that this combo just stays on all
day it gives
you that Photoshop perfected finish it
just looks amazing on the skin and it's
just I really like it everyone's been
complimenting me on my base I'm like my
base things few high base see I've been
really loving this combination I worried
in Mexico got stuck doing that and it
held up against the heat and all the
sweat and all the water it just looks
great is a great combo and I love going
back to lorac I also got cute lorac Pro
palette is this this is pro number one
this is pro number two I love both
equally as much pro number one looks
like this but as you can see the lorac
Pro one has a bunch of neutral shades
they're a little bit more on the warm
side which and then the bottom row is
all shimmery all shimmery all met on top
lovely palette I loved so much and then
the lorac pro 2 has a little bit more of
a Sun it's like the funky sister because
it's got a couple of colored eyeshadows
and a little bit more on the cooler side
so if you were to ask me which one is my
favorite I would probably go for number
one but then I would also say that you
would need both quickly I want to
mention that I've been loving honest
hacia self-made I should appellate I'm
wearing deep purple on my lower lash
line today and pink champagne on my lid
and a little bit of hot chocolate in the
crease it's an amazing palette quickly
when I mentioned that to you favorite
new liquid lipsticks is the combo I'm
wearing today
these are cavities everlasting liquid
lipsticks and I love them so much
the commo wearing today which is also my
favorite of the month is bow and arrow
cat told me how bow and arrow and lolita
are always out of stock so bow and arrow
might be really tough to get but once
you get it you'll fall in love with it
and then to give it a little bit more of
that unique purple Eli likey ashy side I
applied a Requiem this is such an
awesome color and together is just a
winning combo it's what I have on my
lips today I also filmed a tutorial on
Kat at Kats place and we were both
wearing this combo on our lips in the
video and it looks awesome I can wait
for you to check it out Kat actually
just launched

quick shout outs you Becca's Jaclyn hill
