welcome to my October hits Anna God
knows my very delayed October hits inna
God knows I hope you can't forgive me
for that one because I've been working
my ass off off YouTube so so welcome to
November where a new month has freshly
started a week ago and it's time for the
October kits that was the worst intro
ever yes this princessy stick right here
is totally on purpose I just wanted to
look like a little princess
so the first hit for the month of
October aren't my new Jack's Beauty line
brushes and when you see them like that
you're like oh those are pretty okay but
when I show you the handles bub Emma bam
bam the quality of the brushes
themselves are just fantastic they're so
soft and especially the eye brushes I
love my favorite of the entire bunch is
the eye liner brush then number two it's
just a really really really small
eyeliner brush that I use for my
eyeliner today I used it on all my
models and on my clients this is the
perfect eyeliner brush in my opinion I
absolutely love these purses they're
affordable they look really really
awesome each brush has an sort of
different look and it has different
colors and different ways of smashing
the colors onto the the handles and it's
absolutely amazing so one more time
that's Jack's Beauty line love this I've
also been obsessing over this Bobbi
Brown rich chocolate eye pellet and it
looks like this it has the perfect
neutral natural shades if you're a
neutral kind of girl are just a smoky
eye kind of girl I or guy it has all
your met a sort of like deepen colors to
kind of give your eyes some depth and
then it also has met highlighters and
then in the middle it has two shimmery
shades which are absolutely awesome as
well I I have nothing bad to say about
this palette this palette is so
everything is I got it I've been using
it every single day because it's just so
perfect it's in my crease today it's on
my bottom lid today
I love this pellet so the Bobbi Brown
rich chocolate pellet if you're a
neutral lover get on this boat next are
some things that I actually just
received a couple of days ago these are
by Ellis fast and these are called the
hot lip
these are pigmented like no others
business they are insane I will show you
my favorite of the bunch which is l4 I
think that's for lips Elle Elle 404 and
it's just such a bright pink color these
are so pigmented it's
insane like I I kind of put them on my
hands to swatch them for the blog post
review and I didn't really expect
anything and just one like tiny little
swipe across my head of my arm like my
jaw
it was on the floor I was speechless I
was abroad next put the other under put
the other and so the Ellis fast hot lips
lipsticks are insane a blog post review
is coming and once it's up I will put it
in the info box down below but these are
awesome I YouTube I recently discovered
Wow presents and that is sort of the big
thing be horribles drag race that love
from cosmic rays and another find of
last month is Matthew Anderson Matthew
has been on RuPaul's Drag Race a couple
of times as sort of like a director for
like videos but I discovered him on the
Instagram and like his creations are the
bomb.com org
and l EU everything I found Matthew's
Instagram and literally I started and I
started scrolling his page at like 12
and then I finished at 2:30 like I I
couldn't stop looking at his sort of
parts because what he does to his face
and other faces is pure art I bow to you
yeah I use up I found what presences
channel where all the Queens that we
know of do transformations on James and
James and one of them was Raven
and as some of you may know is that
Raven is probably my top three favorite
Queens and he came up with this amazing
tip T up t up teal it's to put a liquid
white eyeliner dot on the inner corner
of the eyes and just when he did that it
opened up the ice completely it was such
a good tip that I started using that for
about a week or so and my favorite
liquid white eyeliner is by Illamasqua
and this is called scribe the precision
ink and scribe and this is pure white it
is super waterproof it's even smudge
proof it is so freaking good and once
you put this on the inner corners of
your eyes it stays there until you're
literally like take it off another thing
by Illamasqua that are really loving
it's a nail polish that I'm wearing
right now and this is called facet and I
did a full blog post review on this so
if you want to see that go check out my
website and get tutorials calm I will
put a link on the info box below but
facet nail polish guys is something you
have to have this is a fall nail polish
anthem another thing that I've been
really loving my Illamasqua is heroine
eyes shadow and it looks like that I
hear some of you thinking all the crusts
might like through my camera through the
internet
I hear you thinking wow now looks like
NYX taupe yes it does yes it does
yes it does so I found an interview with
Alex boxes a woman behind illamasqua and
one of the questions was what is your
favorite Illamasqua product and one of
them was heroine eyeshadow and what she
said was eye contour and shape
everything with heroine eyes shadow when
Alex box tells you that she shapes and
contours with one product you get that
product that's as awesome it is the
perfect shade of contour a last makeup
thing for today is by Mac and this is
the studio finish
skin corrector in light speech this is a
sort of studio finish concealer but it's
in corrector and this is called light
peach so it has a really warm sort of
peachy salmon tone to it and I've been
using this to highlight my blue circles
underneath my eyes and it's been working
like a charm I first put this on the
light peach and then I put my longwear
concealer by Mac on top and that's just
a golden combo because it just lists the
color up and it gets rid of the blue so
on to hair as some of you know I am
following a hair course and we are
Agency in Amsterdam we are is an amazing
course I I'm one with getting teary eyed
because I'm so happy I started doing the
hair course that we are because I did
hair but I didn't really know what I was
doing so I kind of just did something
and then when it didn't come out right
then I would just try to wing it but we
are I learn technique I learned to
actually look at the hair look I'm doing
and just kind of maneuver it a little
bit and make it perfect and we're at a
lesson number eleven this Sunday for we
are and the amount of stuff that I've
learned there is in saying and I just
want to say thank you to we are for
teaching you so many great stuff and if
you're in Holland and you want to learn
good fashion hair definitely take out we
are I found two products that are so
good for prepping the hair and with
prepping that means sort of giving the
hair structure to actually do stuff with
it my favorite is by Sebastian
professional and this is the texture
maker
I've thin hair and but I have a lot of
it and it just it's it just hangs on my
head it just doesn't do a lot it just
hangs there and to give it a lift and to
give it volume but to give it structure
I use the Sebastian texture maker and
just you put this on your roots and then
you blow-dry it and then you literally
just take put your fingers in your hair
and then push it up you take your finger
to out it just stays like that another
thing that I really
love for fashion hair is sort of get
that really raw edge a feeling we're
sort of wisping it out but a really nice
way of giving the hair a really dry sort
of raw edgy feeling is to prep it with
red Ken signature look fashion waves and
ah this stuff is so good you put this on
the roots and all throughout the hair
and then you blow-dry it as well and it
just gets that sort of like beach
texture spray feeling I can't believe
that's it I thought I have more
favourites but this is all I wrote down
on my app so let's go to the Oh God
knows oh yeah No so for the first oh god
no this is gonna come as a shocker to
you because so many girls adore the
out of this my first oh god no for
October is the Maybelline gel eyeliner
I've had this a long time like way way
back I used it I loved it it was better
than Mac better than Bobby Brown better
than all of them on the market and it
was so cheap ba-ba-ba-ba-ba but love
until Maybelline decided to change the
formula and right now it's a sticky
goopy mess that won't dry and it just I
used this on a really important shoot
because we want it like a really bitchy
looking cat eyeliner I was like oh good
I'm gonna grab my Maybelline for that I
put this on and all was fine I was like
this is gonna be okay
I was waiting for it to dry and for it
to dry and I was waiting and waiting and
waiting and this bitch doesn't dry the
new formula makes it so tacky and sticky
that if the model looks normal straight
up again you get a transfer of a black
line in the crease and if that doesn't
happen the color that is on the lid will
transfer onto the eyeliner so you have
this sort of half shimmery eyeliner
that's just not straight and just the
end girl no and for me last God note is
the wintertime at five o'clock
it's dark
outside it's like it's like pitch black
outside of five I really don't like that
because a couple of days ago I didn't
notice that it was just dark already so
it was like 5:30 I'm chilling on my
couch with my dog and I just looked
outside it was like I gotta go to bed
it's like 11:00 already
oh it's 5:30 the darkness outside messes
with my internal clock and that's it for
my hit synagogue nose for the month of
October I think again so much for
