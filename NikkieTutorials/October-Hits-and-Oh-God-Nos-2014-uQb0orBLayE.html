October hits and a God knows and first
of all I want to apologize because I
promised three videos every week for the
month of October because of Halloween
but my schedule that's so freaking busy
that I only could barely manage to put
up to a week I hate it when I can't keep
my promise but I was just so so busy and
I was just glad that I could get you up
and also I have a little announcement
I'm filling this is Saturday and
actually next Tuesday I'm leaving for
Mexico because I got booked by swim Co
which is an amazing Beach where bathing
suits wear bikinis bikinis swimwear
swimwear Swim Co is an amazing swimwear
company and they booked me to do makeup
and hair for their campaign shoots and
their campaign shoots are shots it
Mexico the next Tuesday I leave for
Mexico and it's an eight-day trip so
eight days full of photo shooting on the
beach with lovely ladies and guys and
we're gonna have so much fun and I'm so
so excited I'm kind of nervous because
I've never been to Mexico and it's just
an entirely new country to me so that's
a little bit scary but I'm so super
super stoked and it can't wait so I
don't know how much access I will have
to actual internet so you won't see me
as much on social media unless we have
Wi-Fi of course that I can totally no
spam you guys the help but I did not
know if the Wi-Fi or internet connection
is fast enough to work with YouTube so I
have pre-recorded a couple of videos and
if the Internet allows it I can put
those online while I'm in Mexico but if
I can't I can't and there's nothing I
can do about it so then you would have
to miss me for about a week so other
than that let's just go redheads to my
October consent God knows I don't really
have a lot because this was but it was
kind of shitty so let's get crackin my
first absolute favorite of the month are
the Anasazi Beverly Hills a single
eyeshadows and it's on the sunset and
her team were so nice just
I mean all the single eyeshadows and
they look like deals these are
absolutely amazing and I've showed them
in a couple of tutorials this month and
it's really kind of get you introduced
to them because I plan on using this so
so much more they launched November 10th
on the UH Nastasia Beverly Hills website
and once they launched definitely go
check it out these are so freaking
freaking freaking tenant um these are so
bloody amazing and if you try them out I
am sure of it that you will love him as
much as I do
another huge favorite this month is by
Kevin D it's D tattoo liner in trooper
also used it in a lot of tutorials this
month because it's amazing at first I
wasn't too impressed by it because I
felt like I needed two layers to get it
opaque but after working with it a lot
more I am in love with it it's so
SuperDuper pigmented I just found out
that you just have to shake it a little
bit and do one pass on your hand and
that will get the products flowing other
than that it's amazing the tip is
amazing it's so fine and precise you can
make the most detailed liners with this
where my eye liner with it today wore my
eye liner with it yesterday the day
before yesterday this entire month when
I've been wearing eyeliner
it was Kat Von D trooper yeah trooper I
was like I've been fed up right yes the
Kat Von D tattoo liner in trooper is the
 if our nation
I tried because of GG gorgeous here on
YouTube she's been going on and on and
on and on and on and on about the studio
sculpt of foundation so I was like okay
if she loves it I might love it so I ran
over to Mac and I bought one this is
nc15 and I do have to tell you guys said
I love it
I'm wearing it today mixed with another
favorite that I will talk about in a bit
but it's super super good it gives a lot
of coverage and what did you said is so
true that it stays on so well it doesn't
budge it doesn't go anywhere and we're
this to a theme park when there was a
Halloween Fright Night so people are
trying to scare you so you run and you
sweat and you you make up moves on
nights like that and it just stayed on
like
it just did what Gigi told you what it
was supposed to do so Gigi was right
it's an amazing foundation so the other
foundation I wanted to talk about is by
benefit and it's the hello flawless and
I'm in the color I'm pure for sure and
as I said let me grab it and now these
two together are like the golden combo
because they will give you the most
perfect flawless face ever
and it just it doesn't go anywhere it
doesn't make you too matte it doesn't
make you too shiny it's just the right
mix of shiny and mattes and it just
stays on it looks good I love the color
and I'm in love with this coma right
here so both on their own aren't
absolutely stunning but together oh
they're like the Avengers I also want to
talk about these saffron neon eye
pencils I went to a Dutch city called
namaha with one of my good friends looks
by sharon also here on youtube so we
went to the super cheap drugstore and i
found these and they had all neon
colored eye pencils and knowing the the
color and lover that i am i saw these
fell in love toss them all in the bag
and bottom and they're so super duper
pigmented if i show you the green like
one pass focus focus green the pink look
at this bam look at this
biome so those are amazing neon colored
eye pencils they're great for your kit
and gauges they because like to each two
euros each so you just buy them all at
once and you can toss them in your kid
and you're done but you will always have
a punch of neon on you it's harder i
feel loving this month is by Mac and
it's the invisible studying power set
powder invisible set powder it looks
like this it's just clear it looks white
but it's clear and I know big shocker I
went a little bit away from my Chanel
and after Lewis finished powder in
Claire because I felt like it made my
concealer dark again well I kind of
highlight it with me concealer and I
felt like it made it more neutral again
which I didn't want so I figured that
with the Mac invisible set powder
invisible it's gonna keep the color as
is and it did and
it's amazing and it keeps you matte but
not too much well you know it's
controllable you can make yourself as
mad as you want with this tilde plus
this FB loving by Gerard cosmetics our
shimmer of hope because whenever I do
hits and a God knows I toss on a new lip
because then it can talk talk and talk
away and I always pop shimmer of hope
lip gloss over top wherever I'm going
and I'm wearing a gloss it's probably
shimmer of hope and Gerard cosmetics
because it's just a perfect nude for my
complexion I think it's another loop
plus I've been loving when Gerard
cosmetics is Bermuda Bermuda Bermuda and
it's just a basic purpley Lila key
periwinkle color and it was like who
wears this as the lip gloss but I wore
it once to a party and I'm so in love
with it because it's so unique and out
there you definitely have to love that
that you know the the weird colors on
your lips to like this but I love it so
for all my neutral needs shimmer of hope
from a crazy days Bermuda alright last
hit of the month is by Viktor and Rolf
the flower bob perfumed I think I got
this like three years ago in New York
maybe four years now I think four years
ago and I noticed out whenever I put
this on and I went to my boyfriend he
would say you smell so good I don't know
about you but when my boyfriend's
compliments me on my scent and I keep
noticing that he doesn't with pictorials
Flowerbomb I'm like okay I'm gonna wear
that more often because I am loving the
compliments it's just so funny because I
kind of tried it out like I wore black
opium by USANA and then he would be like
hi babe I was your day and then when I
would wear Flowerbomb it would be like
hi babe
you smell fantastic how was your day so
it made me love to perfume even more
because he complements me on and when
I'm wearing it and that's actually it
for my hits this month guys and I have a
really bad one I'm gonna hold the tape
for you let's go oh yeah
no I don't have a product oh god no the
only oh god no I have for you this month
are my eyes for about two months now
I've been struggling with red eye white
it just gets red whenever I put my
contacts in and I've been going to a new
optician for so long now and we've been
trying to find the solution but my eye
white keeps getting red when I wear my
contacts
so we tried new context we tried new
solution and I don't know what to do
anymore with my eyes because whenever I
put my contacts in they get red and
people have told me to change the
solution to change the the context
itself we we did that all and still not
really working so I hope someone here
has ever experienced this that has a
solution because I am on the end of this
contacts road I don't know what to do
anymore I wanted to get my eyes lasered
to you know get rid of the entire
context but I'm just cared for that
because God - have they cut in your eye
and I don't know what to do anymore so
if you can help me out that would be so
so so appreciated trust me so that's it
