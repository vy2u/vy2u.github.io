ode to Kesha enough people are going to
click away like crazy
I like Kesha I like her music I love her
style and we haven't been hearing a lot
of her lately so this is sort of like an
O to heart this is sort of like the the
this the sleazy eyes the like mint eyes
my intention was to make this a mint
spring look but then I added these like
Mike Wright stuff and I was like this is
so Kesha so yeah that is everything that
I have for you today I know this isn't
for every day and I know people are not
really gonna love love love this but
hopefully my next video will be a little
bit more wearable because my last videos
were all pretty damn out there so yeah
if you want to know how I got this Kesha
inspired thing then please keep on
watching so the first thing you want to
do for this look is a PI a base your eye
was to prevent the action for creasing
and the one I'm using is a Mac soft
ochre Paint Pot I use it all the time
and I'm just gonna apply that onto my
lid and my lower lid as well okay now
I'm gonna take this and write egg jumbo
pencil in milk and I'm gonna apply that
as a sticky base for all the colors that
are going on top and then blend that out
with your fingers and then on the bottom
as well because we're going to apply the
the minty color there too now I'm going
to take this color star I shattered a
number 58 I want them to do with that is
sort of cut my crease because you really
want a sharp crease right there
and then also apply it as a eyeliner to
your lash line here once I got that I'm
just gonna take a little bit more of
that shadow and I'm just gonna blend
this out this can I take a bigger brush
and start fading the edges just blend it
up now I'm gonna take my favorite
blending brush the Mac 224 and I'm just
gonna make this even softer okay now I'm
going to take this eyeshadow by
collistar in number 59 which is just one
number up from the previous one the and
what I'm gonna do is just apply this
onto the lid just packing it on there
I'm also going to apply that color is a
brow bone highlight freedom I'm I'm
going to take the same color star eyes
shadow and this eyeshadow from Mac
called femme noir and I'm just gonna
take a little bit of finger and make it
a little bit darker oh crappers dropping
everything I'm just applying this to the
rest of the bottom lid all the way to
the inner corner I'm gonna take a bit of
mix aquifer and mates with that color
sorry shadow I'm just gonna smoke it
down a bit you know I always do this in
my videos just because I love what it
does to the eyes I'm not going to take
my Illamasqua sealing gel again and I'm
gonna mix that with Mac's turquoise a
co-leader and Turkish glitter is just
like the eye shadow we use but just in a
glitter form with that I'm just gonna
make a mixture and that will become like
this um this glitter liner and that is
going onto the inner part of the lower
lid
and then just apply it as a clear
aligner to the bottom wind okay now I'm
gonna take this a liquid eyeliner this
is by our young um I don't know I got
this in Berlin and this is a liquid
black eyeliner and I'm just gonna make a
really nice a big Blake Blake Blake I'm
just gonna make a really nice black
winged eyeliner dramatic and baked just
the way I like it
for the inner corner of the eyes I'm
going to take makeups videos dual effect
in shine and I'm just gonna pop that
unto the inner corners for the waterline
I'm going to use along combs Lecrae on
or just like a black waterline butter
water cold it's not black it's called
black lapies la peeves and I'm gonna pop
that on my watch her line and apply some
mascara the one I'm using is my favorite
my makeup studio mascara in waterproof
3d extra black for last was I'm gonna
use these new sugar pillow lashes that I
got and they look like that they're
really long really wispy really flirty
okay now for the Grady white stripes I'm
using a aqua color from our this is like
the extreme color art from peace I'm Pro
this is called a white sensation I'm
just gonna start off with one following
the black line and I place one right
here underneath the white place a mint
colored line as well and then I'm gonna
add a point right here to right there
okay Philippe's I just wanted to keep
everything really neutral because this
is too much

bit fuller with next stripped-down lip
