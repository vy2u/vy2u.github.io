to do a tutorial on this look right here
and this is totally inspired by Asda
great powerful the great and powerful
this is inspired by Glinda the Good
Witch of the south I guess I don't know
well she's blonde so she's probably from
the south I went to the movie yesterday
and I absolutely loved the visuals it
was truly orgasmic and Michelle Williams
as agate which was beautiful and her
hair I know there are countless amounts
of tutorials on this here right now in
YouTube and I was like I'm gonna join
the party because I love this look so
this is kind of my take on Glinda the
Good Witch totally trying to stay true
to the movie makeup and so yeah if you
want to know how I did my Glinda version
then please keep on watching so the
first thing you want to do of course is
apply a base to your eyelids to prevent
the eyeshadow from creasing and I am
using my trusty old Mac soft ochre Paint
Pot the first eyeshadow I'm gonna use is
by Mac and this is called shroom and I'm
gonna highlight my brow bone with this
so just kind of place it underneath the
highest point of your brow then blend it
out sideways then wipe off your brush
and blend the edges and make them go
soft for the crease I'm gonna make a
mixture between mechs copperplate and
kid and these two together is like the
perfect color of that Michelle were in
this movie and you'll literally want
this to be so soft I'm just brushing
that in really lightly no hard pressure
at all just really lightly touching the
skin and blending this in sort of
feathering this end and that will just
give the tiniest amount of definition
but still the definition that you need
with this look for my eyelids I will be
using this Oz the great and powerful
palette by urban decay and this is the
Glinda one go figure and this is the eye
shadow called illusion and that is going
all over the lid and I've been really
really liking this palette it's so soft
and it has amazing shiny products in it
there for that amazing inner corner
glitter / shine that Michelle had on her
in
corners I'm gonna take my makeup studio
dual effect and shine so just go ahead
and pop that on to the inner corners and
kind of dust it out and blend it out and
look oh I love it okay now I'm gonna pop
some ben nye neutralizer cream crayon in
light mp2 onto my waterline and now I'm
gonna apply the tiniest amount of gel
eyeliner to kind of hide the band of my
false lashes later on and also to give
the lower lash line a little bit of
definition through this is gonna use my
Mac black track fluid line so you want
to keep this line as small and as tiny
as you can so don't make it too thick
just keep it really really thin and
small and delicate and it's just you
hide the band of the lashes later on
and for the bottom I'm gonna draw a
really tiny line and you can really see
in the movie that Michelle had this
going on it kind of gave her definition
without it looking too obvious
and now just start blending that out of
making it a bit softer
okay I'm not just gonna apply some
mascara this is my favorite makeup city
or waterproof 3d extra black and down
lashes are an absolute must with this
look because this look is kind of all
about the lashes and the gorgeous hair
so the lessons are going to apply are
the Miss adoro 7 4 7 m medium so I'm
gonna apply all that and then I will be
back for the finishing touch such a
really matches I look to Michelle's look
in the movie we're gonna add two sort of
mini sort of pearls to the inner corners
and outer corners of our eyes
I already popped one on this side as you
can see one on the outside and one on
the inside and we're gonna do the same
this eye and you just want to do that
with a little bit of glue and then just
pop them on
for the cheeks I already went ahead and
did a bit of contouring because I like
to do that off camera because then you
can't see the fullness of my chubbiness
so what I use for contouring is my NYX
blush in taupe and then instead of my
Omsk blush in disobey I use this
bourgeois sort of bronzing powder in a
chocolate form to warm up my face for
blush Michelle had this really super
natural sort of fleshy pop with cheek
fleshy pop cheek that should be a
McDonald's drink hi can i order the
flashy Papa cheek thank you so the
blushes that we'll be using for the Papa
cheek art Mex style and the dainty
marelize blush and a glowy highlighter
is a must for this look because in the
movie Michelle had this amazing glow on
her skin when she moved I was just like
oh you're just as shiny as two china
doll girl and oh my god I love it so to
get that amazing glow I'm gonna use my
Mac mineralize skinfinish in
lightscapade and the Oz color again that
we used on the lid as well this is
called illusion formula so we'll be
using this Yves salawah Rouge pur
Couture and this is number six and I
hope it didn't butcher that and then to
contour and give my lips a little bit
more fullness I'm gonna take this Urban
Decay supersaturated high gloss lip
color in Glinda and this comes with the
eyeshadow palette and just sort of
contour the lips and give yourself a
little bit more plump this I mean we
don't have a magic wand here so we're
gonna use the magic supersaturated
lipgloss color and that ladies and gents
wizards and non wizards witches and non
witches completes my Glinda the Good
Witch Oz the great and powerful movie
inspired makeup tutorial I really really
like the movie it was so cute it was so
fun to smoke that Glinda creates a
I wanted that all over my face I'm one
of my hair color to be that figure guys
