love for contouring and highlighting on
my fair skin tone so much on a daily
basis that I thought why not do an
entire video on how to contour highlight
and blush a fair or pale skin tone I'm
about as pale as pill can be I'm as
white as paper so in today's video I
share with you every little secret and
tip I've learned along the way it's been
a long process through a lot of trials
and errors but I think so far I finally
managed how to contour warm up glow and
blush up my face my pale face without it
going overboard or too much and of
course I love my contouring so sometimes
I look like a drag queen yeah if you
would like to know how I contoured
blushed bronzed and glowed up my entire
pale face right here then keep on
watching so before we get to contouring
of course we need a flawless base so let
me go ahead and apply a foundation and
the brush I'll be using for this today
is the tweezer men tweezer men the
tweezers for your eyebrows actually came
out with brushes and one of the brushes
I've been really liking by them is the
contour foundation brush now originally
of course this was created to kind of
sculpt your face with a more cream
product but I love this for regular
foundation application so I'm just going
to take my foundation and apply my
foundation with the contour foundation
brush by tweezerman
and before you ask I already primed so
I'm just gonna start stippling most of
the product onto my face with that brush
and then once you get most of it on it
start buffing and blending it in and I
just noticed that this brush is so
capable of getting the maximum coverage
out of any foundation so with this you
only need the tiniest bit of foundation
or any product you're using and it will
go such a long way it does not sort of
eat up the foundation that a lot of
brushes tend to do like literally take
the most little portion of foundation
and it will go miles and I'm using a CC
cream now and you can see how it's
really covering me up
to really get a seamless application you
can always go in with a sponge and blend
in any traces of too much gunk egde a
foundation now quickly apply some
concealer and for this I'll be using
another tweezerman brush and this is the
pointed foundation brush and of course
again I break the rules I don't use it
for foundation I use it for concealer
and again I'll be bluffing this in using
a sponge then quickly sitting it all
with powder to prevent it from creasing
so I went ahead and filled in my brows
and did my eyes and I made my eyes a
little bit more on the dramatic side
because right now these eyes are fun and
all but you're like wait something needs
to be if you have pill skin and you want
to get into contouring the first lesson
you need to know is to never go too warm
you can contour with powders creams gels
you can contour with whatever you like
just remember to keep it on the a shear
greater side if you make your contouring
products too warm it will actually look
like a warm stripe of brown on your face
just chilling there doing nothing for
you and trust me when I say I've made
that mistake many a time many a times
same goes for bronzers of course if we
want to we can of course go for warm
rich velvety luxurious saturated tones
but that will just look crazy on us in
order to warmer complexions up and to
give us that bronzy feel we have to go a
couple shades lighter and cooler so my
two favorite products to contour with
are number one my Bobbi Brown wheats
eyeshadow this is so great
I think Bobbi Brown is available
throughout the entire planet by now and
I just really love what this does to my
face if I apply this it naturally
enhances any shadows I may have and it
really gives me that structure and
sculpture and another true old favorite
is heroine by Illamasqua of course now
illamasqua heroine is a little bit more
of the warmer pinkier side and wheats is
a little bit more on the gray or greeny
side can you see how the Illamasqua one
is a little bit more warm and brown and
almost pinky and this one Alma is even
more gray and has a greenish tint so
it's totally up to you which one you
prefer I like both I don't mind both but
today I'm gonna go for Bobby Brown for
bronzing powders I absolutely love the
Park Avenue princess pallid by tarte and
this has a bronzing shade right here and
this really warms up the skin without
going too far and another one I really
like is by L'Oreal and this is the glam
bronze and number one and this is a tap
it more orange and saturated but still
gorgeous nonetheless so what I like to
do first is warm up my complexion with a
bronzing powder then once you've done
that you already have a little bit of
sculpture going on and then with the
contouring powder you can really enhance
it so today I'm first going in with my
Park Avenue princess palette by Tarte
and bronzing up my complexion and also
sculpting it a little bit so first I
start right here at the frilly key thing
of my ear that's where I place my brush
and I start going back and forth right
there in that line notice how I also
kind of place the brush from underneath
pressing up to my cheek and this will
really create that depth just keep going
back and forth and do some circular
motions to blend it out nicely and then
once most of the products is on I go to
the corner of my mouth to get that
sculpture now if you feel like for any
reason it's becoming too warm just take
your powder brush and kind of tone it
down a bit and take down the warmth I
also like to warm up my neck area and my
jaw line and then also a tiny bit of
bronzer right at the hairline going back
and forth and then slowly dragging it
down a little bit onto the forehead so
hairline slowly coming down a bit
hairline slowly coming down a bit once
your bronzed up you can already tell
where that sculpture is going you
already see that nice cultured contoured
features coming out and you just want to
enhance them it's tiny bit with the
contouring shade so I pick up a little
bit of my Bobbi Brown wheats eyeshadow
just a tiny bit and right at the base of
the darkest portion of that cheek so
right here that line we started with
that is what you want to enhance you do
not want to create a line going from ear
to mouth because that is drag queens
left drag queens but we're trying to
keep it a little bit right now
today so really softly start defining
that first line you made and blend it
out in circular motions now again if you
feel like it's too much powder brush
let's take it down a little now again I
also like to follow through onto my jaw
line and going to the gym next week it's
happening see see how this is really
nicely sculptured and this is just like
okay we're getting there now us pilsky
muties we got it hard enough as it is
because if we go too hard on the powder
on the contouring shades on the bronzers
we look dirty so fast like you don't
even want to know so if you feel like
you went too far and the products are
showing too much on your beautiful fair
skin tone then go back to your
foundation brush and kind of tap where
you feel like it needs to tone down a
little and that will take down the
extremeness for highlighters I feel like
everything is exactly the same as
bronzers and contour powders because
highlighters on us can look dirty
because they're too bronzy we need
highlighters that are pretty damn white
and reflective and chrome because else
you will not even see us
my favorite highlighters at the moment
are these so Susan's statement skin in
starlight the bombs mary lou manizer
becca shimmering skin Perfector in
moonstone and lastly NYX it's prismatic
eyeshadow in Girl Talk today I'm going
for the NYX prismatic I should and Girl
Talk because it has a little bit more of
a pinky tone and since I have purples on
my lower lash line I feel like it ties
in a little bit better so for
highlighting the main key focus you want
to go for for highlighting is right here
at the tops of your cheekbones I like
going up really close to my eye right
here almost touching my eye and then
blend out over that cheekbone that will
really make you look listening and glowy
other parts of the face that are amazing
to highlight and give yourself that
glowy look with the tip of the nose
Cupid's bow
and right above the brow as you may have
noticed I apply highlighter before blush
because I feel like everything is a
little bit more cohesive if you do it in
that order now for blushes I feel like
with fair skin tones the best color
choice you could go with are light warm
peaches my favorite blush is for my skin
tone and lighter and around my skin tone
our Milani baked blush in Luminoso girl
ass golden high blush anger last chic
pink today I'm going for the golden high
one and I just swirl my brush right in
both colors and I focus blush a little
bit more between the contour and the
highlight so this is where we contoured
this is where we highlighted I go right
in between with my blush and I kind of
melt all three together and because I
have a rounder face I don't really go on
to the apples of my cheeks for blush
anymore because I feel like if I go more
towards the side of my face right here
it just makes me look a little bit more
sculpted I also do like a little dash of
blush over my nose and above my lip and
since we did all of this with powders
you want to take away all the excessive
powders with fix+
by Mac this will take away I'll be gum
to a powder and will make it look like
real skin again just let that dry give
your lips and you're done and that's my
fair skinned beauties is how I like to
contour and highlight my fair skin and
