just say why the hell does she have she
tricked me

at the airport I was like oh my god come

let's do the video that we did with
Mitchell and I was like okay I got to do
half her face yeah and then she gets
when she's like I have a night yeah I
want to change the whole video and how
does it sound if you did my whole I've
been trying to get him to do this since
Halloween remember Halloween I already
wanted you to do it so I finally have
booked my first success of the year
Patrick Starr is transforming me into
Patrick Starr
I can't wait and said do you know what
look you're gonna do with me I will
disclaimer I am NOT Sir John I am NOT my
mama Mitchell I can't wait for the video
that says he could screw up not being
able to speak on her own channel for two
minutes strains you know what the funny
thing is you know who probably edits
those videos wait every time Patrick
boxing I become more light no it's like
not gonna let the seat
you're out of frame now I'm normal then
come in frame I'm late turban and
everything let's go so the first thing
you're gonna do I'm gonna take this
video
Tachi you know what's so crazy is that
I've never used this so
that's right you took a right at the
mouth
oh my god I feel like all you're a
celebrity stars I haven't done anyone
like Kim Kardashian Katy Perry it's
Arabic I asked you to so Madelyn attract
me the list goes on and on and we're
official you just know like everyone's
coming down below yes or no would you do
nikkietutorials makeup it's just too
intimidated because she knows her face
and I can't follow the stars like miss
fame and Sir John yeah I don't know it's
just like you you know what what you're
doing now that we're back with James st.
James I'd like to take the NARS natural
radiant long wear foundation and the
cover FX power play and spackle this on
her face I mix equal parts on the back
of my hand okay so I want more coverage
so I'm gonna go Patrick Starr and take
the equivalent of full coverage
Foundation which is the studio finish
the same thing so what you want to do
for full coverage is we want to take the
concealer mutilated hip can for
nikkietutorials because she loves full
just Irish so until you hit pan that's
when you know that you
I went to hit pan just for you first
time ever in this basic 15 and that
we're gonna do so next I'm going to take
this light peach corrector right so
since we love a full coverage Queen I'm
gonna take all the concealers that she
brought with her
NARS NARS pots Kylie and ex1 mix it I'm
being serious everyone or somebody makes
them spray your brush next I'm going to
take a clean fresh Beauty Blender when
you're working on a drag queen just make
sure you don't get to the ladies what
I'm doing is just pulling back the glue
and just going in favorites on drag race
right now go aquaria cracker Asia okay
and whoever the one is that does what's
after full coverage powder and quickly
under the eye
so next for brows I'm gonna use the
precision brow pencil by NYX in the
color ash brow pencil well she's real
cute and we're done goodbye going for
Pat McGrath Oh God where is she I
haven't launched it yet but it's divine
who isn't your dream list of still
working with God I think he's so cool
today Beyonce channel would be so fun
let's play a game
what will cardi call her kid if it's a
boy she'll call him damn and if it's a
girl she'll color image that we're
trying to recreate a lighter shade right
here have you seen the New Avengers
movie I have and you know what left
before we get into Avengers ok because
this video is gonna be super fresh I
will say if you want to be friends with
Nikki and you happen to see her and you
want to talk about pop culture RuPaul's
Drag Race
Avengers anything that you haven't seen
don't bring it up because she's that
type of girl that loves spoilers I love
spoilers see with the New Avengers movie
infinity war I got so excited to see it
I'm just like oh I need to be prepared
like people told me it's extreme like a
lot of stuff happens and basically I've
watched a lot of like separate scenes
and Linda one of my best friends goes

at this board now next I'm gonna take
one of my favorite color is here from
actual me sources
Daniel did you see a quiet place No so

mistakes that I'm going to make in the
next five minutes Sigma brush next week
