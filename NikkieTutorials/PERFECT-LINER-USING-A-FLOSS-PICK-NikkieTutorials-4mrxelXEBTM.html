am back I have been gone for two weeks
now and it's all because my body has
went to about a month ago I got the
strep throat and that that hurt like and
a girl got antibiotics for that and the
strep throat seemed to go away then a
week later came back then I got this
horrible horrible cough and that turned
into me losing my voice and not just for
a day or two or five
I left my voice for literally two and a
half weeks and it just came back the day
before yesterday so I still sound like
your local drag queen I still sound like
that girl your ex calls after a midnight
I sound atrocious I'm so sorry for that
and I wanted to do my hits and a god
knows for you but talking is making me
really tired because I haven't done it
in two and out the ultimate level so it
feels so incredibly good to be back with
you but today I'm gonna put a new makeup
technique to the test today we're gonna
find out if doing your eyeliner using a
floss pick works now I don't know
exactly who started this trend so if you
do know this please let me know in the
comment section down below so I can put
this person in my description box I've
seen this going around a lot I've also
seen the bobby pin
these are all very Instagram ways of
doing your liner cuz you gotta get those
views dome out yeah
alright so we'll be putting this
technique to the test what do you think
will it work won't it work we'll find
out in a little bit I'm now gonna take
this makeup off then die oh hello there
you caught me Mick so my foundation is
done my eyebrows are done and my
eyeshadow is done and now comes the
moment of truth for these Floss Picks
I'm actually really hopeful I actually
have a very great state of mind about
these I feel like these might be amazing
to help beginners for the people that
are in a rush and just need guidance and
go I am
we really hopeful here so if this fills
me III will cry I will go into fetal
position and cry so here we have my
philosophy and I particularly like this
one because it has the end that really
mimics a winged liner alright so are we
ready okay I'm gonna grab my Mac liquid
last aligner this is my favorite liquid
liner because it stays on through
everything you could be a teenage little
mermaid going through her emo phase and
this liner will stay on in the ocean
alright so when you look at the pic you
want these straight line to go here this
is gonna be your way
wherever the curve is is what you want
to have on top so by no means do we want
to step it like that that's just not
going to end well let's let's just not
do it let's just forget about it you
want to turn that around and get that
straight line coming from so basically
all I'm gonna do is coat the tip of the
pick use a matte liquid liner and then
stamp it on okay we're coating it we
have begun this tests please don't let
us down okay okay here we go oh my god
that's horrible okay let me do that
again
okay we we got something all right now
would be the time to connect your wing
to your lash line and make it a complete
waiting now mind you I have a war make
up in two weeks so pray for me and
because I like my wing to cut all make
Raiders in half I like to create a very
thin flick at the end right now it's
like it's like right now it's poking the
haters we need to cut them yes
all right so I'm not gonna lie I really
like like the angle of the wing I like
where it's going I like I really like
this wing I'm not mad at this wing this
wing is doing it for me like it goes
well with the ship so good about this
wing so normally when I do these tests
and I and I usually what I do is give up
and do the other eye off-camera and give
up the test completely and regret my
life but since today's test is actually
quite successful so far let's do the
other eye all right we got our pick
let's coat it and stamp oh my god that's
atrocious up you're not messing this up
it's been a good day you're back on the
tube it's been a good day to mess this
up okay that's horrible oh my gosh
nothing
all right so I feel like I managed to
pull through kind of save the day on
this one here so we can live we can we
can go on with our lives
and you know no crime today maybe um so
yeah let me apply some lashes let's do
our cheeks and lips together I'll be
right back all right so first thing I'll
be doing for my cheeks is bronze me up
using hoola Lipa benefit you know sort
of as a contour not really but kind of
for blush today I'm gonna use one of the
new Anastasio Beverly Hills blush to
Rios this one is in the color pink
passion and I'm just gonna be mixing
these two together and for highlight
today I'm going to use something new
I've pretty much used ever glow my
collaboration with Oprah cosmetics ever
since it came out and like it's really
hard for me to part ways with it but for
today's video I'm going to try something
new this is by violet boss this is the
pro highlighter rose gold palette I mean
hello there this is sweet this is me
this is so good this is so pretty this
makes my heart warm so I'm going to be
highlighting my cheekbones using this
color right here and maybe just in a
couple of others so kind of like play
with it but for now we're going to use
balloon
oh that is pretty I will say it it
almost like the powders are so buttery
it almost feels like there's oils in the
powders sound cell where it cuz like
powder and oil don't really work
together but these feels so buttery that
they almost feel oily and sometimes that
can enhance the texture of your skin a
little bit more or like it will cling on
to one part of the face and not really
blend out nicely so I just use a more
careful like delicate hand when I play
with highlighters like that but come on
oh she is and at the moment nothing is
more popular than strobing the forehead
I see it everywhere nice healthy looking
for heads that aren't you powdered and
have a lot of glow and reflection and
like strobing so my favorite product for
this is dandelion twinkle by benefit
this has that shimmer capacity but it
isn't overpowering but it still gives
you that strobing looks I would have
called this a blinding highlighter cuz
it needs a little bit of help for that
it gives you that healthy radiance but
it's not too much and formula Sudan
finally diving into the Kylie X Kim
Kardashian collaboration this is the
k'kaw cream liquid lipstick and the
color Kimmy
all we need now is to lock this all into
place I'm going to use my Kat Von D a
locket setting spray I think my lashes
are wet and that guys concludes this
video finding out if a floss pick can
help you create the best wing of your
life conclusion I don't know honestly
the first eye I tried I thought it was
great it's a great guide but on the
other hand the second eye sucked and I
really had to fix it using musculus so
I'm gonna go ahead and say that this was
a fail it's a no from me it is reaching
a level of extra nest that maybe we
should steer clear of but it's fun I
mean I had a lot of fun doing this so we
got that for us so that wraps up this
video for a full list of every single
product mentioned and use good to my
