one of the latest crazy makeup
techniques out there you know we've seen
so many trends and techniques come and
go between the boozy blender to still a
sponge we have seen contouring your nose
with the fork it seems as crazy
technique go around where people really
powdered their faces and then dunk their
face into a bowl of water come out let
it air dry and apparently that gives
them the most natural finish but every
time I see the video I'm like that
doesn't look good at all so we've seen
it all we have seen so many crazy
techniques crazy trends crazy products
and I am here today to talk about a new
one I was going through my Instagram and
I saw this post by Bob Mon Zaid and I
just just watch oh yeah baby she is
doing her eyeliner using a thread she is
mapping out her lines using thread and
then filling in the rest with a brush or
a pencil or an eyeliner whatever she
says I saw this little trick on BuzzFeed
snapchat the other week I feel like
people do a better job because you're
able to make the angles of the wings the
same but I guess it's still cool okay so
I'm already up for failure
yeah and at first my judgy sign came out
and I was like we've got the time who's
got the time but then I figured you know
what this can be a great help to people
starting off with liner you can give
yourself a nice guidance but you know
what I am just here today to try this
technique out with any further ado today
we're going to do our eyeliner using
thread and we're going to see if it's
worth it if it works if it's extra if
it's unnecessary if it's super
unnecessary let's just let's just try it
out oh my god so up close to personal
hello hello alright so we went to rick's
grandma of course when you need thread
you go to someone's grandma and she gave
me two types of thread this one is a
very very thin silky one my mind is
telling me this is a little bit too thin
we never know
and then I have this thicker one but
this is also a little bit more hairy
what what should I go for silk and thin
or thicker and more hairy those the
question I'm going to go for the center
one because then if it completely failed
you know there's always a way out so I
got the thread right here and I guess
we're just going to cut a little piece
off snips and what they did was paint
liquid liner on the thread and then take
the thread and kind of stamp the liner
onto your eyes because I'm already kind
of running into problem number one I
personally always do my makeup using
this handheld mirror but how can you
stand with one hand and then still okay
we're busted out the big mirror so oh my
god I'm starting to get nervous so let
me just see if this actually works if
you go oh my god this is hard
wait what oh my god oh I thought
this was going to be easy suddenly I
don't want to do this video anymore
alright I'm going to grab my thread and
then paint it using liquid eyeliner and
just going to clamp it in between my
fingers I'm just going to paint it
painting just red okay oh okay here we
go
what is that can you reposition with us
oh that is splotchy that is stick it is
really hard to find your angle and then
to place it on really nicely and good
but we came up with this okay now the
goal is to paint that portion again and
create your line going towards your lash
line so that is exactly what we're going
to do so I'm going to put the thread in
between my fingers again so it can paint
no God
okay we're painting again I painted the
thread and then now we go and make our
wing I mean if you want it for guidance
I mean sure I guess so like I don't see
how this is going to look the same on
the other side plus it's just a blotchy
so this payment thread goodbye we now
have to find a way to fix this nailing
your liner is practicing till your arm
falls off nailing langer is never ever
giving up you know there's a light at
the end of the tunnel here and I don't
feel like this is helping us out if
we're looking at it I got my guidance I
know where my wing has to go to I know
where I have to fill it in but still
this side is never going to look the
same as this side and you know what the
best part about this is is that once you
have that guidance you still have to go
back in with a liner and actually finish
the job so that's what I'm going to do
right now
all right so this is what it looks like
once you have filled in that wing and
got rid of all the bumps and little
ridges in the end it looks good but it
is time-consuming so extra okie-dokie I
added some lashes and did my other eye
of course free-handed not using the
thread yeah I think I'm going to claim
this technique as a fail unnecessary and
don't get me wrong I honestly hoped that
this would be the technique for people
to use when they're first starting out
doing their eyeliners or when they're
starting to get into the world of makeup
and want some guidance but this thread
will not lead the way in your guidance
in your path to better makeup let's see
yeah guys that concludes my video I want
to thank you so much for watching you
can follow me on Twitter Instagram
Facebook and snapchat that all iznik
tutorial as always if you enjoyed
watching this video then please don't
forget to give it a thumbs up and
subscribe to my channel I want to thank
you so much for watching
umm I am so glad that I can show you
these techniques and put into the test
and let you know if they're worth it and
if they work and I can't wait for the
next one part of me is scared that the
next one is going to be doing your
eyeliner using a straightening iron
contouring using dog food you know at
this point nothing shocks me anymore so
thank you so much for watching I love
you and hopefully I will see you guys on
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
