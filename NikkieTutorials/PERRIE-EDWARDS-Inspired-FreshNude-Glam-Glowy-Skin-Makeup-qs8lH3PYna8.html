on this makeup look right here it is
what I like to call a soft nude glam
because there's minimal stuff going on
at the eye area I tried to keep
everything really soft and lashy and
girly and then super glowy healthy skin
and neut lips actually I did this look
because I was inspired by this look on
Perrie Edwards from Little Mix I saw
this look because a couple of you
tweeted me this picture asking for a
tutorial and I started doing my makeup
today
sort of following along with Perry had
on her face and then once I was done I
felt like all the attention was so
beautifully drawn to the eyes that
instead of the bright red lips I went
for a nude but you could definitely go
for a red or like a liquid lipstick but
yes also throughout this video I will
try out a couple of new makeup products
from it cosmetics and I'll put a link
below because I got a little promo code
for you so yeah don't forget to use the
promo code down below I hope but other
than that let's just go right on to the
tutorial so I'm going to start this look
off of course by priming so I'm just
going to go ahead and quickly pry my
face for foundation today I'm going to
use the it cosmetics a CC plus cream so
it's actually not a foundation but I'm
gonna use it as foundation and I've
heard such great things about this I've
heard it's moisturizing pore minimizing
color brightening sounds like a deal to
me and since most of you enjoyed the
natural way of applying my foundation in
my previous video I'm doing it again
today
god this easy cream smells so good it's
like a fresh summer day by the pool with
a nice cocktail free concealer today I'm
going to use the it cosmetics bye bye
under-eye I got this because of luster
lux Katie she's been talking about this
so much and I'm gonna try it out today
whoa this concealer is something else oh
my goodness
I'm using the shade light and I just
feel like that is exactly perfect for
fair porcelain skin tones like my skin
oh my god it's covering up everything I
definitely get why Katy loves this so
much now quickly setting everything with
powder so it won't crease I quickly went
ahead and filled in my brows I just did
powder and brow gel only no concealer
again just to make it look a little bit
more natural so let's go on to setting
this whole thing so in order to keep the
face looking a little bit more natural
you don't want to powder too much
because that will become pancake II so
to lightly powder my face I'm gonna take
the it cosmetics bye bye porous powder
also heard great things about this oh
and also I've heard they came out with a
pressed version of this so if you prefer
pressed over loose then definitely check
that out so to keep it a little bit more
natural I'm powdering my t-zone plus a
pet peeve of mine is when hair lines are
greasy they want a powder right next to
the nose and then also a little bit on
the chin and on the sides of your mouth
where you get smile lines and that is
all you want a powder and of course if
you bake wipe away the bake before I
start my eyes I first want to prime and
today I'm going to do that with my Mac
soft ochre Paint Pot as always next I'm
going to go into the it cosmetics
naturally pretty eyeshadow palette and
I'll be applying sheer joy and love all
over my lid up into the crease and for
this I'm using a morphe M 504
with a morpheme 511 I'm picking up a
little bit of a warmth and I'm going to
use this really likely to define my
crease
to highlight I'm taking this color pop
super shock cheek in fanny pack and this
is going on my inner corners brow bone
and lid
and going over top using transforming
pearl by the it cosmetics palette to
open up my eyes I'm applying a little
bit of white I call to my waterline now
to grab this look a little bit more I'm
picking up my cavity tattoo liner in
trooper and creating a super thin line
no wing whatsoever just the line to make
the lashes and everything ground a
little bit more now to finish off all
you want to do is apply mascara to top
lashes only and falsies and the falsies
of using today are by violet Voss and
these are called vamp Tris it's a bronze
the skin a little I'm taking this
palette by morphe and this is the 9bz
palette and I'm taking this color right
here and to make it a little bit more
yellow to bronze me up I'm taking these
two right here just really softly start
bronzing up the cheeks and also kinda
softly sculpt with it for blush ananias
girl at chic pink I'm focusing it more
towards the side of my face and blending
it in with that bronzer we just applied
and blend or mesh the two together and
to highlight you guessed it I'm taking
fanny pack by color pop again and just
going for that ultimate glow today
I want to keep my lips very nude because
I really like how almost cutesy and
girly business without going too far so
for my new lips I'm going to take my
current favorite mute lipstick which is
by melt and it's the color nude and then
let's hop a little bit of colour-pop
lippie stix in the color same and that
concludes the look and that guys
concludes this nude wearable lashy glam
