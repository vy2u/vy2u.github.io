this tutorial inspired by Perrie Edwards
from Little Mix Little Mix recently came
out with their new music video for no
more sad songs and literally all the
girls look so incredibly gorgeous like
they all had tones of red and maroon of
purple in their look and literally all
four of them looked insanely pretty so
today I'm doing a tutorial inspired by
Perry but I also really want to do
Leeanne and Jade and Jessie I kind of
want to do well so please let me know in
the comments down below if you want to
see another Little Mix look from no more
sad songs and if so who let me know in a
comment yeah today we're diving into
this very dramatic red smokey eye I
think it is so captivating it's so
pretty not going to lie I kind of feel
like that snapchat filter the drag one
with the red kind of feel like that
right now but I absolutely love this
look and if you want to know how to get
it on your own face how to do it then
keep on watching
alright so to get this no more sad songs
look started I'm first going to go in
with this way to overprice primer by
Sicily it is called the long-term and
intense double tensor primer I've talked
about this in my previous video it is
crazy expensive but it keeps your makeup
on all day long for a foundation today
I'm going to go in with another really
long wearing product this is the Estee
Lauder Double Wear stay in place and
makeup and I am in the color one and one
this color is a little bit more money
but I'm going to blend it down my neck
and then I'm going to bronze my neck up
later so it all looks cohesive so I
better not see any memes out there
saying that it is a match because it
will
and I've noticed that you have to work
fairly quickly using this foundation
because once it sets into place it will
stay there like there's no chance that
you can move it or blend it out a little
more once it's set it stays now it's
time for concealer
and now I'm setting my under eye area
using my finger blender and the
dermablend powder all right the first
thing I'm going to do is pry my eyes I
have found this amazing new product it
is Mac's Paint Pot in soft ochre I've
never used this before I am so excited
to try this out now I'm going to set my
crease of brow bone area using a bone
color shadow to help lending later on
I'm going to go in with Mac's blush in
mocha and this is going to be my
transition color in the crease and since
this is a very dramatic look don't be
afraid to go all the way up to those
brows now with a clean brush I'm
blending out the edges for the smoothest
most precise blend of life now going in
with Venetian red from the Anasazi
Berkeley Hills modern renaissance
palette and this is going on the outer V
and in decreased and on that nose bridge
is going everywhere
and if after doing that you're seeing a
harsher blend go ahead and go back in
with that clean brush and blend the
edges
I'm intensifying the red using this
Illamasqua eyeshadow in Damon this is
also the shadow that Adam used on Perry
and this is mainly going in the crease
and really focusing on the bridge of the
nose and if at this point in your look
you're like Nicky oh my god it looks
like crap
red is a really hard color to look nice
during the process that I'm promising
you that in the end it will all pull
together now I'm taking this Mac blush
in sketch to deepen the outer corners
and also adding a little bit of black
shadow to it and I'm first packing it on
the outer corners and then with my
blending brush my clean one I blend the
edges on the lid I'm applying Helen YZ
pigment in number 17 you can also go for
the Vermeer color in the modern
renaissance palette but I feel like that
Helen EE pigment has a little bit more
intensity to it
see how that totally brought the lift to
life like we went from disastrous to
hello there on the water line I'm now
applying the Mack cold power I pencil in
feline to get it nice and smoky and then
I'm also playing a little bit in between
the lashes to smoke it out later on a
zueva three to five brush I'm smoking
that out using sketch blush by Mac and a
little bit of black and then going back
in with
illamasqua Damon to warm it up with some
red going in with another Helen II
pigment this one is number sixteen to
light up the inner corner and now to
finish off the eye all I'm doing is a
quick black wing without the wing to
hide the lashes later on for lashes
sidin we'll go in with the Lily lashes
in Mykonos I know Adam use different
ones but these were closest to the ones
that Adam used on Perry so I'm good with
these
her cheeks are not going to go in with
hula light and the hula brush by benefit
and I'm just going to warm up my face
because you need to wind this up first I
start swirling on to my cheekbones kind
of as a contour but not really but kind
of this will give us that warmth now for
a little bit of additional contouring
going to go in with Deaver dial
instaglam Deluxe contouring powder in
number three and my favorite contouring
brush nothing too much although Perry
had quite the sculpted going on on her
cheeks not a little too blush but a lot
of sculpting and bronzing for just the
tad bit of blush and go in with this
kylie one this one is called verily
legal why would you why would you do
that Kylie nearly legal for highlight
I'll be using Kylie cosmetics french
vanilla this is actually me giving it
another shot because so far it wasn't
really all that impressive to me but
Harry had a glow on but it wasn't
blinding so Sally we're not going to one
today as you can see it definitely shows
up on the skin it's just not as like
powerful and like in terms of I want it
to be but you know some people like it
more soft some like a blinding like me
and I like this for people who want a
softer look and then a little above the
brow right there just a chat here for
some luminous and a little bit on the
chin we're not going to do the nose I
know I'm so sad but Harry didn't have
anything on her nose glow wise so we
must resist the urge all right her lips
are first going to line using this
Maybelline Color sensational shaping lip
liner in nude whisper 105
this is actually really sudden color I
love that lipliner now for lipstick I'm
first going to go in with this Charlotte
Tilbury one in pink Penelope or no woo
Penelope pink and now to seal the deal
I'm gonna go in with a setting spray
this is all nighter by Urban Decay and
we will lock this one into place and
that guys concludes this Harry Edwards
