inspired by Perrie Edwards from Little
Mix with their new music video shout out
to my ex this music video is nice when
this music video came out I didn't even
see it myself yet and it got so many
requests from you on Twitter Instagram
just everywhere to do Perry's look
because Perry was isolated the game and
Here I am today finally doing it for you
I love the little stars were gonna be
playing with today they just give such a
fun twist and of course if you're
feeling frisky or you have a party to go
to you're gonna always replicate that
look that the girls had going on with
all the glitter and rhinestones where
they would apply their highway it's just
such a cool cool music video and Perry
looked amazing and I'm so excited to be
showing you this look today hey I think
we got any further ado let's give Sain
the middle finger without any further
ado if you would like to know how to get
this a makeup look right here then keep
on watching alright so the first thing
I'm gonna do for this Perrie Edwards
makeup look is moisturize my face to get
a nice base to work with and I'm gonna
be using this little magic pot right
here this is a new Oprah product that
will be launching January 2nd and it's
in collaboration with one of my best
friends kim tae congratulations baby and
this is still a tester form because I've
been trying to smush Ty's her out for a
couple of months now and I fallen in
love with it and I not only love it as a
moisturizer I think it is perfect to use
as a base underneath your makeup because
it really makes any product that you put
over top grab on to it and really adhere
to the skin so I think it's a great
makeup base and that's why I'm using it
today and no this will not be the final
packaging I cannot even begin to tell
you how good it is to finally be able to
talk about this Kim let me try this I
think 3 months ago and I've been
obsessed ever since but I could've
talked about it now I finally can I love
this stuff for foundation I'm going to
be using this one by Mac this one is
called the pro longwear nourishing water
proof foundation I'm in the color nc15
and this was also the foundation that
her makeup artist used for her for the
music video and I'm applying this using
my Beauty Blender
and for concealer today I'm gonna go in
with the Urban Decay Naked skin
concealer and the color fair neutral and
of course altiplano get in yeah I'd be
the winner damn I'm trying to step away
from using the Tarte shape tip concealer
but after using the shaped a for so long
and then stepping back to another one
it's just such a disappointment like
nothing in my eyes can compare to shave
tape at this moment like nothing and now
I'm going to set my under eye area with
powder to prevent it from creasing next
to set the rest of my face I go in with
this maybelline superstay better skin
powder
I discovered this in New York and ever
since I've been in love with it it just
beautifully sets your makeup and keeps
it on all day long
plus it's affordable I am really really
really obsessed with this one
okay I know with Max should bring white
powder I'm going to highlight my under
eye area using this new brush that I've
been really really liking it's the
stigma baked kabuki f-89 brush and I
think it's the perfect size and width
and density for the under eye area to
just flawlessly apply that on your eye
highlight or just do or just to set your
bake or get rid of your it's just a
really really good under eye brush see
it's just perfect
already I'm not gonna do my brows
off-camera and then it will be back
before I do anything on the eyes I'm
gonna prime to make this look last all
day long and this is my Mac soft ochre
Paint Pot
the first color I'm going to go in with
is by the morphe 35o M palette and this
color right here is going into my crease
and we're softly going to focus this
more towards the inside crease so see
how I'm pulling focus right here on that
inner crease that's where you want to go
don't be afraid to go high up in that
crease if you have a lot of space to
work with
use it now hopping over to this shape
right here for more definition but
softer definition in the crease so we're
just continuing defining that crease we
just don't want the color to be as dark
and intense on this outer portion here
we want the focus to go here on that
inner crease
now with the darkest color of the
palette I'm going to define that inner
crease even more so we're creating a cut
crease definition here and although we
haven't cut the crease really once we go
in with the lid color and really go
against that line it will look as if we
had a cut piece going on all this time
and what this I think you can see that I
really mean that we want all the
definition to be a met inner crease
right here don't be afraid to go all the
way in hopping over to the morphe 35o
shimmer palette and taking the very
lightest color to cut the lid and you'll
see by me going right up against that
line of the crease it will give you that
cut crease illusion and continue
blinding that lid using that same shade
and also highlighting the inner corner
using that same shade using a
combination of the two crease colors I'm
slightly defining the outer V for the
waterline of first going to go in with
these you waste Lynn cream eyeliner in
matte black
and then taking the darkest color from
the crease again from the morphe 35o M
palette and smoking it out and then
we're also winging that out too lightly
for my wink today I'm first lining out
using the Tom Ford eye defining pen in
deeper and fill in using my favorite Mac
liquid last liner all right now with
black shadow is really important to
diffuse and smoke out the outer corner
of that liner and kind of wing it out as
well so that is exactly what we're doing
with the pencil brush I'm softly smoking
that out little by little until it
becomes as a beautiful haze seems sort
of like that nice and smoky for lashes
I'm going to go in with one of my
all-time favorite styles these are the
Lily lashes into style tease and for the
little star I'm putting down a little
bit of lash glue and then sticking the
start right over top
all right first for cheeks let's do a
little bit and by a little I mean a lot
of contouring I found out about this new
product right here this is my road dial
and it's the instant glam compact Deluxe
contouring powder in number three and
this is what it looks like and honestly
if you're using it in New York with
Maybelline and it just it has changed my
world you only need a tiny bit of it it
has the perfect color to make it look
like a shadow as an actual contour as
opposed to like a warm brown muddy mess
and I've been really really liking it so
that's what I'm going to use today to
contour with oh I honestly want to look
so pinched and so stingy and so pull
together I'm going in with this powder
and what I enjoy most about Little Mix
is that they love their glam they are
true British glam goddesses and I love
that I love it when it's the artists
that just obsess over glam like I do is
just connect it connected by birth okay
so we're looking to Tim pull together
that's a really bronze up my face I'm
gonna go in with another one of those
powders but this is number two and this
is a lot more bronzy a lot more warm and
this is perfect for light skin tones
early bronze with so from the contour
I'm using this as a blush but coming
from the contour so it's like a warm
contoured blush bronze
yes and now all is left to do is blind
highlight go all out
so the first highlight oh yes and there
will be two the first highlight I'm
going to go in with is by make up
forever look at this this one is in the
color pro light fusion undetectable
Luminizer number one and the brush I'm
going to use is a morph er 36 I really
highly enjoying this to highlight with
oh yeah baby here we're going baby ooh
baby no stopping now no going back now
we're bloody okay right on the centre of
that to really make a pop my morphe
pressed pigment and champagne nights
this is everything and more and disputed
in your life and just watch how just
softly blinds even more i'm obsessed and
i'm going to highlight the bridge of my
nose using that morphe pressed pigment
alright if for lips you want to go for
one of those classic darker almost
Instagram nude colors and I found my
match in jus a lip cream in the color
Terra
and I think all we need not to finish
off this look is we need a spritz of
setting spray I'm going to use the
makeup forever one and then we're done
and that guys concludes this
