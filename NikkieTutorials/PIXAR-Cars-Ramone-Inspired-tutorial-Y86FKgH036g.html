for the Pixar inspired makeup well this
is the tutorial for it because um I
thought it was funny I hadn't done a
tutorial in a long time so here it is I
hope you like it
um yeah it's inspired by cards um couple
comments uh yellow fire stuff things I
hope you like it and if you have any
questions leave them in the comment
section below and please keep on
watching
okay to start this look off you're going
to apply in face I already applied my
Miss Helen I to the ways and we've got
gonna apply some NYX miss jumbo pencil
and then I'm gonna take some I'd not and
my mere on basic pellet and I'm gonna
take the yellow and I'm gonna apply that
onto my lid and not in the crease
because that is where the purple comes
so that's what I'm gonna do right now
Wow I'm gonna take my 120 palette
finally a look with my 120 palette
everyone is asking me do I look with
your 120 palette okay so I'm going to
take that color that yellow one it's a
sigma 239 brush from the travel kit and
I'm going into the color take quite a
lot and you're going to Pat that onto
that yellow now you're going to cut the
crease and I'm gonna use my gosh truly
brown pencil and let's see start right
there and then wing it out bring it out
and then go in
like that and then I like to take a
little teeny brush and blend it out of
it and now continue with the yellow to
below that line so fill that entire
speeds up with the yellow there you're
going to take the Sonia Kashuk brush and
we're going to take a purple out of the
120 palette and the one I'm using la and
the one I'm using is that purple right
there and I'm taking the purple and go
in that line or above that line and just
follow that line and try to make it as
blend it as you can just do really slow
steps then take your n Sigma 224 brush
also from the Trellick and blend it out
a little bit more now I'm gonna take
these CBS crease duo and I'm gonna take
the small one and I'm gonna take a Mac
sketch multi color and you're going to
follow that line that we made just
follow it
and take that bigger one and blend it
out with more shadow on it so take some
shadow on it and blend it out
yeah I'm gonna take that signup Keshav
brush once again and blend it all out
take some effort for the stuff because
you really want to blend it out
now take your 224 brush by Sigma I'm
gonna go in the purple retrace where you
had the purple
it's coming along now I'm going to take
max gesso but you can take the wine out
of this appellate as well I'm gonna take
the 252 brush or any brush you prefer
for your highlight and this is going on
your brow bone and here we go again
my favorite trick is to blend all those
other colors down except for the yellow
so like here I go down so now I'm gonna
repeat all the colors the highlight the
purple the sketch and then the yellow
and then redo it all again and then I'm
going to show you how to do the lower
lid for the lower lid I like to take the
Sigma treble get 219 and go in gesso
that white color by Mac already went
Clark from the palette and I'm going to
like put this on the inner corner like
crazy like oh my god it needs to be like
white then I like to take sketch with
that same brush but wipe it off and put
it on heavily on the lower lid on the
outer corner meeting the white
and what I like to do is um drag it
under that yellow you see like gasps
three winged outliners purples of yellow
and the darker color now you want to
apply any Langer you like I'm gonna use
my black track fluid line I'm gonna do
that a little bit winged as well I'm
going to apply black eyeliner to my
waterline I'm gonna use just any regular
black and set it with black eyeshadow
then I'm gonna apply some falsies and
today I'm going to use our delts wispies
and then I will be back to tell you what
its Omelas so be right back so I'm gonna
lips I have on my new favorite lipstick
