today's video because I'm gonna be
playing with a magical makeup so over
the last couple of months brands have
been coming up with products where I'm
like how is this even possible is that
magic you're a wizard Nicky stop like
for example this palette right here this
palette is by storybook cosmetics but
when you see it at first you're like
Slytherin so for example this storybook
wizardry and witchcraft palette which is
so so stunning I cannot wait to dig into
this one today think of magical Rose
brushes I mean come on we are in 2017
and in the meantime story book is in
2038 so there's a bunch more magical
makeup that I'm gonna be playing with
today and do my makeup with and I wanted
to do an homage to my homie to my
homeboy Harry Potter
since everybody is saying that my
boyfriend looks so much like Daniel
Radcliffe Harry Potter today I'm gonna
be playing with magical makeup but to
decide where this makeup book is gonna
take me hence why my face is naked as
well I actually want to do a sorting hat
quiz right here live in front of you to
see which Harry Potter house I'd belong
to you and then whichever one wins I'm
gonna do a look inspired by the colors
and like the vibe and hmmm what Harry I
you've made it to Hogwarts which means
you've already bought a wand from
Ollivanders what material is its core
phoenix feather dragon i play this with
me please play this with me and post
your results in the compton below
phoenix feather
dragon heartstring or you inner corner
during the end of year exams you notice
that one of her classmates was using an
enchanted quill oh you bad boy you come
top of the class anyway but they are
second what do you do nothing but if i
hadn't come top of the class i
definitely tell the professor
you will be most heard if a person
called you weak ignorant unkind or
boring I'm gonna go for unkind are you
still playing with me it's been 15
minutes and we still haven't found out
which house I belong to and the winner
with a 32 percent is Gryffindor I am so
excited because now I can play with the
red of the palette so I'm actually
really excited about that outcome today
is Gryffindor inspired magical makeup
day and let's go I'm going in with my
favorite color of this palette they're
red called sorcerer and I'm applying
this from lid into the crease and go
high up Bay because you want to make a
statement with this color and then on a
tiny little brush like this I'm gonna
start buffing out the edges now I want
this ballon out like magic
as a transition color going to go into
that peachy shade called charms and
placing this right over top that line
where it starts becoming a little bit
less beautiful
softly in and then going back in with a
clean blending brush to get a traceless
now because of adding the peach over top
you lose intensity of the red in the
crease so now I'm actually gonna go into
this a wizard and witchcraft inspired
makeup brush so it legit looks like a
magic wand but it's a brush wait for
this one do you see this one it's got a
little s for storybook and it looks like
that so that is pretty much a magic wand
from the Harry Potter world into a
makeup brush and I think that's so cool
so they come in a bunch of colors and
I'm gonna grab the blending one from the
rose gold mine and re intensified the
red with that now I'm gonna go into the
color bewitched and this one is a
beautiful everyday glam color but for
today I'm putting it on my inner corners
and I want that inner corner to be super
intense so I'm gonna go in with a dual
chrome gold highlighter color duo crows
were the first product for me where I
was like when I started doing makeup I
was like is this magic how is it
possible to have like two colors in one
shadow so this brings me back to the og
magic makeup days one of my most
favorite unforgettable moments of the
movies is when Dumbledore flies away
with his Phoenix so I kind of want to do
a sort of magical liner inspired by glow
away meg she is the liner Queen so we're
gonna be starting off with a basic black
winged line and we'll go from there
so here we got our basic wing and now
let's put some magic on it so I'm
starting off with the orange vivid
liquid liner by NYX and this line is
going over top of the black and then
once it reaches the wing it goes under
it so now it's a line going over top of
the black line and then it comes out
underneath here and then you just want
to swoop it out and for the yellow you
basically want to do the same but it's
coming from the opposite way so for the
yellow it starts here goes underneath
here and then goes out there
and now you can always go back in with
the black and perfect where they meet a
little bit more and not taking a couple
of these diamonds and flaring it up a
little so you can definitely put some
lashes on and stop and call it a day
here but I love having that extra
dimension on my lower lash line so I'm
gonna go in with the brown which is
called burrow muck and this is going on
the outer - about halfway in of my lower
lash line from there I go back in with a
sorcerer there red underneath here to
leave some space for a highlight in
there I'm applying the bronzer color B
which but then I want that to be a tiny
bit more yellow to tighten with the the
magic liner so I'm just gonna take that
liner again and add some yellow in
okay time for some lashes they're going
to be applying the Lily lashes in the
style goddess and that will be the eyes
done
okay so eyes are done and looking
magical as ever I'm actually so proud
for not doing a boring-ass look today
now as for my next step this is bronzer
now there's nothing magically wise that
I have for bronzer the only magical
thing I can think of when it comes to
bronzer is that I don't look like a
ghost so there goes that so let me
quickly pry bronzer before we move on to
the next magical product the next step
is contouring and just like bronzer I
don't have a magical contour powder but
what I do have is a magical rose brush
this is also my storybook cosmetics and
I must say this might be my favorite
portion of their entire collection
because just just look at it these have
a way to them they feel luxurious
they look so unique one of the petals
even has the S from storybook the
brushes are red it doesn't get more
fascinating and beautiful than this in a
makeup brush and my favorite part about
this is that they actually work they are
amazing quality brushes and a little
getting used to to the thin like handle
to the thin like roast em it honestly is
like doing your makeup with a magic
brush because it's like doing your
makeup with a rose and I think it's
fascinating and it just it I could so
I'm gonna be grabbing this one right
here to do my contour with today
I will say that they are so pretty that
you don't want to use him
I've had these sins a couple of weeks
after they came out and personally for
me I keep them on display so it's like
my little magical makeup moment but yeah
for a blush I'm gonna use the tiniest
bit of Oprah's might I and another Rose
brush I'm placing it more towards the
side of my face as if it's part of the
eye look and then a for highlight my
original plan was if the quiz told me
that I would be in Slytherin this eye
look would have been green and totally
different and I would have used the pop
luxe glow and the dark highlighter now
this has been going around YouTube like
crazy this is a glow-in-the-dark
highlighter so you put this on your skin
and when you have a black light it
lights up so it's not glow in the dark
as in turn your lights off in your
radiating light it's more so if you have
a blacklight near you and you're wearing
this highlighter you're gonna have like
crazy highlight going on so um I just
wanted to put that out there if we're
looking for a magical highlighter for my
highlighter today I'm gonna go for
something more gold toned like I have on
the inner corners of my eyes if I'm
gonna be going into this palette right
here it's my makeup addiction cosmetics
this is the holy glow Volume one and I
want this Goldy color right here with of
course another rose brush
now for lips of course this is a
no-brainer I have to go for the
brand-new ciaté glitter flip liquid
lipsticks these are liquid lipsticks you
apply them to your lips let them dry for
two minutes and then once you smack or
rub your lips together glitter appears
I've seen so many videos on this and
every time I watched one I was so mind
blown it was crazy so today of course
for this magical look I have to wear one
not sure which one I want I have this
dark red oxblood color right here and
this one is in the color forbidden
Forbidden Forest
perhaps and then we have this darker
purple one which is called fortune but I
am going to go for forbidden because of
the name and it's more red and it will
fit the theme a little bit more perfect
color
and now we wait alright so here it is
dried up now let's Mack once oh my god
oh my god oh do you see that that is
literally the coolest thing ever it is
breaking down a little bit like it's in
my teeth it's all crumbling into my
teeth but holy wizards that's awesome
and that guy's concludes us playing with
magical makeup video I honestly had the
time of my life doing this video because
I stepped outside my box what kind of
turned in something so basic and boring
and turned out into a lot of fun and I
just sat down played with makeup and I
am so in love with all these products
that I use today
I think the palette is stunning I've
been using it a lot off-camera so I'm so
excited to finally introduce it to you
on camera but I just got my creative
juices out of my body right now they're

fulfilled and very happy and I hope you
