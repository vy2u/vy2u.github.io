right back at you so today I have drew
Barrymore here on my channel and so I
know yet she is one of my favorite
people on planet earth and I'm not just
saying because you're sitting next to me
but it's honestly true we'll get to it
later I call her the Meryl Streep the
Elvis the Queen she did of makeup drew
is gonna take a taste of the power of
makeup cake we're we're gonna be doing a
one side of her face full glam and one
side as you know it totally nothing
can I ask you a question does anyone
ever ask you like what's your side and
do you have one I do it's this one so
you don't have a side that you prefer I
mean maybe if you like a more open side
that's your better side but I don't even
know I have the privilege of doing her
makeup yesterday and I would felt so
confident and beautiful and empowered
after you did my makeups I did not want
to take it off last night and it just
it's so exciting
well guess what you're getting them
again today a thing you have to know is
that when Drew gets excited she either
meows or works yeah I also like to hit
and punch when I get really excited to
already I don't know I'll try to contain
but get my insurance ready all right so
without any further ado let's go with
the power of makeup on drew Barrymore
okay so the first thing gonna do is
prime power of makeup everybody we're
gonna color correct I love that color
oh Fenty you did it you really did it so
we're just gonna bring around the
foundation we're using is my flower
Beauty my delusion is like when I was
talking about its elf 3 your favorite
color is it's my tone right now and
we're just bouncing
and now talking about flower beauty
one of the biggest plot twists to me is
that you have had this computer eight
yes we've been in store for seven we
developed it for about a year and a half
which is fast and or at least was fast
in the beauty world that we were
exclusive to Walmart we decided to put
all of our money into our formulas but
there was just the sort of versioning of
YouTube and beauty influencers me and I
could sense that potentially a new era
was upon us and with not a lot of time
and not a lot of money you're forced to
get clever so I said you know what I'd
rather have better formulas and less
traditional marketing that we just can't
afford anyway but I do love marketing
and being Co creative director at
covergirl and into flower beauty I am
raising two daughters while I've done
this love Niki olive got her makeup done
by Damien I loved the old Revlon the
most beautiful girl in the world
campaigns I used to always put those up
on my wall it was about the woman and
not the scenario in the backdrop and
sort of the cleaner you go like this
white backdrop I feel like everybody
feels like they could be here yeah and
when you've got sort of like black gold
rain and like this kind of Zoolander
vibe or you know like girl in jungle or
you know again sometimes what these
companies do I just I don't necessarily
relate to that I'm like a girl who
dances in her closet in her underwear
and nobody needs to see that but do we
know we're very big Honduran I do things
like go from like here it's like they
could double as a parachute if the
buildings on fire your face my god I
wish I could rip it off and just give it
to you so we're just powdering the face
a little seed the nice little
highlighter spots I like to keep those
wet so later on when you apply the
highlighter it's just gonna grab even
more and become even more shine so it
doesn't sit on top of the foundation as
much exactly attaches to the skin
exactly real quick gonna do your brows
now if you're new to my channel hello my
name is Niki this is true I don't do
brows on camera because they freak me
out so right now we're gonna do a little
cut and we'll be right back so true
since I don't want to leave the people
hanging cuz they just missed out on the
brow part I want to make it up to them
by doing a little quiz since Santa
Clarita diet is one of my top favorite
shows it means so as you know Ramona's
also life yes I have a couple of
questions okay and it is called drew
versus Sheila okay
okay question number one
Sheila eats people yeah what's the
weirdest thing you've ever eaten
I had these um like chili salt sriracha
and covered grasshoppers in a margarita
and I thought there's no way I'm gonna
be able to eat this I ordered more it
was so delicious
and then it just like washed down with
the tequila I'm telling you it was
shocking
it tasted like crunchy little morsels of
like Sheila went out and bought herself
a Range Rover
yes are you an impulsive buyer and what
is the biggest impulse buy you've ever
made what is the biggest impossible very
I'm a house I'm not kidding I went and
bought a house once and then sold it
immediately because I freaked myself out
like yeah just just kiddin yeah I mind
yeah I'm doing that ever yeah my
business manager was thrilled Sheila
stuffs her freezer with fresh meats
mm-hmm
what is the weirdest thing you stuff in
there what's the weirdest thing for me
it's lipstick
oh and oh oh it's like Marilyn Monroe
member and 7-year itch she puts her
panties in the icebox to keep cool I
want to do that although in reality I'd
probably never mind
Sheila calls herself the element of
surprise people don't expect her to jump
on people and kill them yeah it is you
know it happens sometimes it does what's
the biggest misconception about you I
definitely have a dark side and I can I
can be like prone to feeling you know
just as depressed as I can mm-hmm happy
and I have to work really hard at being
happy and happy sounds like this kind of
like lofty hippie concept but if you
fight to be happy it takes a lot you
have to earn happiness it is a battle to
get there but it is the battle worth
fighting more than anything else oh my
god amen
Sheila barely sleeps how are you want no
sleep
I do I hate no sleep but you know most
of my life I've been pretty no sleep
because I started acting when I was 11
when you were pushed out early I like
and I came out with like a cigarette no
Martina I was like loves dualist
I do appreciate a good night's sleep
I'll take the like nyquil acne hammer
anytime - I love a good sleeping pill
I love being like goodnight dad you're
later I love like a seizure I'm like
whenever I get the chance to be put
under and like make it real slow there
like backwards from 100 I'm like bitch
if you don't let me get to 50 I'm gonna
kill you this is like the one time I
know I'm gonna sleep without anything
messing it up it's like oh we're gonna
have to do surgery I'm like great
Kavi anesthesiologist cuz I'm there I
had to get like wisdom teeth pulled I
was like I'll be put out for this right
and they're like no I was like no at
this point my life the sad thing is I
take melatonin to go to sleep so do it's
really good ed not you the hell it works
I don't take any sleeping pills drugs
nothing like I'm super clean and pure
I'm on a amazing cleanse there's not an
impurity in my body and
I switched to melatonin it's the best
it's changed my life alright moving on
to eyes so today we're using of course
flower beauty these little costs you
came out I can't believe oh the wonder
less palates and you or even a tiny bit
don't don't use too much yep and the
Glitter is more like a Fleck rather than
a tiny little mica or glitter I noticed
when I was wearing that formula from the
lab while I was testing it a lot of
women
we're pulling my arm and saying what are
you wearing and so I really fought hard
to do that formula cuz it was extremely
expensive for the eyes were going with a
blown-out warm moment so we're using
these two shades right here right now I
am so excited you picked two of my
favorite shades in this collection I
loved this sort of orange e peach and
then terracotta color started you know
that's why I love makeup so much you
know you you play with products you see
what they look like and you're like well
let me play on that I think eyeshadows
in particular to just give you and now
in the current climate which did not
used to be the case two three years ago
is on lip women are wearing green lips
yellow lips blue lips black lives yeah
and it's a new place to play with color
on the lid we're going for this pinky
duochrome e shade mm duochrome this is
I asked her if she's gonna do a makeup
line because I really think there's
anyone more qualified on planet earth oh
I would love to but it scares me it
seems like every other week someone has
a brand someone's coming out with this
someone's coming out with that there's
just so much responsibility and it comes
to that that I'm like I know that if I
ever decide on doing it that I will be
able to handle it and I will know how to
like do all of it but the pressure is on
yeah and to be honest it scares me
intimidation is a good motivator though
that's also very true I always like
doing jobs that scare me like when I
went and did that movie scream I wanted
to do it because I thought it must be
really challenging to act like you're
facing death and hyperventilating and
hysterically crying and I wanted to like
face that challenge and it wasn't about
just doing like a scary movie the script
was so good and I liked the idea of
someone you think is gonna be safe dying
because then all bets are off but I was
like to pull that off and make it real
and not too campy but have that
legitimate genuine like holy factor
and not use fake tears and keep that
level of energy up night after night
after night because it took us a week to
film that one a week a week oh my god by
day three you're like Oh am i dead oh my
god so when something scares the
out of you it's a good thing you gotta
grab it by the balls and do it that's
right swing hard I would love to see
your makeup line good pressure on me
drew no I just think you need to rule
the world
dad you already do so just keep rolling
I'm gonna put you in my bag and take you
home I could fit in it that is all you
should see me when I'm trailing Nicky I
would look like her little we're gonna
stand up just so you see can you believe
there's love yeah when I think of you I
think of experimenting thank you I've
seen you wear it all you've gone from
smoky eyes to the 90s brown lip yeah
- beautiful glowy soft skin soft moments
the bright red yes is first vivid memory
of makeup well I was just thinking when
you were talking about that about my
10th birthday party mm-hmm that was in a
nightclub because I lived that crazy
life definitely a drugstore palette that
had numerous colors of eyeshadow I
remember taking the eyeshadow and going
over my lid and then read ABing it in
the color and starting it here and going
all the way to my temple in like a
straight line it like made me feel so
cool right and at your tenth birthday
party if that isn't like the height of
awkwardness to feel cool because of the
power of an eyeshadow and an
untraditional application of it it made
my whole party you want a true warrior
yeah it's staring out of the rink and
you know how we fill up those bricks so
get ready for round two of drew versus
Sheila Sheila has Joel as a partner in
crime yeah if you would start eating and
killing people
oh what's your partner in crime beat I
volunteer as tribute I was a partner in
crime
are you kidding I'm right there I'll
just like be your a little wing man no
I'll be your wingman that's quite a
wingman Sheila loses body parts once in
a while yeah yeah what's the first body
part you would lose if you had to choose
one I would love if somebody could just
carve
the underneath of my arm so that it
didn't hang like a schoolteacher make a
double appointment like yeah I I'm like
if someone could just taken that off
yeah I'd be really like yeah and then
they could start with my stomach they
could just start like grabbing let's
schedule an extra hour for me thanks I'm
just gonna put it into the universe yes
for Sheila to eat me on season four oh
that's right season three I think we
could still make it happen no God that's
victory imagine it's a huge meal I would
say it I mean that she'd be good for
we're the best meal a person could ever
have in her that that's right Wow what
was your inspiration back in the day
makeup-wise style wise because when I
say icon icon oh my god people know you
for like the 90s lip yes
no I true people on Twitter when I said
that I was filming with you they were
like are you gonna do the 90 lips I
never see myself first sort of think
about myself in an exterior way which
helps you kind of have perspective and
not become a humble asshole so I figure
you know it's best for me not to you
know think about myself and I did love
that era of makeup it was it was a
really fun time thin eyebrows and those
strong kind of chalky brick red and
brown lips they kind of made a big
statement without a lot of effort also
you know the 80s were such a great time
for girls because there were so many
awesome musicians especially men that
wore insane makeup whether it was like
David Bowie or Duran Duran or Boy George
it just kind of had this like all bets
are off everything is welcomed kind of
feel you know and I think it made people
a lot more confident with experimenting
and expression like I said when I think
of drew I think of red lips it is just
it's your color and I have this one
planned out which is fun - yeah popsicle
and especially with the I look right now
but drew equals red I'm sorry
well you know Mac Russian red brings me
back really I didn't even tell you yet
when I grew up Charlie's Angels I was my
religion and there's one scene that
totally made it for me remember that
scene when you were ringing the bell and
we're trying to get like was it like an
eye print yeah and you were in the jury
that scene ivory wanted that I think 78
times and how you were like huh no thank
you for making those movies because and
I know we're we're about to go deep here
but I watched those movies pretty much
every other day my mom hated me for it
because there were three women and I was
like that could be me yeah you know
there's something about the power of
three it's like a trifecta a tripod
there's a real strength
you can't tip it over you feel like you
can't put yourself in there there's room
for everybody yeah just uh with my
head what the Chad oh my god by the way
that I have my lipstick all the way down
my face that's a real half makeup look
because I took half of my face and I
smeared the makeup on my eyes and lips
and I wake up with like half my hair
sticking up straight there's the half
face I look for yeah so this one is the
color scarlet letter
now all we need is my favorite set
explai flower beauty has a seal the deal
this is a matte finish they also have a
dewy finish which i like for the beach
like you said the distribution of the
mist of the spray oh you know how the
morphe spray is like the finest one we
know this is finer than that this is so
rad
see that's the valley girl in me I'm 43
and I'm like this is so rad the power of
makeup right look at that beauty beauty
