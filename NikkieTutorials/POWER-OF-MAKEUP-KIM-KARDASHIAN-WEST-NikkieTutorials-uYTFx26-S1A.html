white under eye yes we did it a little
too white
I will 2011 I got a little crazy a
little heavy with the foundation you
know who you're talking to right now
right because there's a long I wish I
could do that on myself take advantage
of this time and get a lesson on how to
do my makeup erotic let's go down to
memory lane okay
I took a makeup class when I was 14 my
dad put me in a makeup class and it was
Jo Blasco and then dermablend I just got
into that morphe sponge it's so anyone
oh thank you it's just fascinating to me
everyone just gets into the business and
makes such a name for themselves how did
you get into it
I had the flu and I was watching the
hills and I was 14 and I was like look
really beautiful and I was really
insecure and I got bullied and I was
like you know what I wasn't look like
them so I found a tutorial on YouTube
and this girl did wake up and make up
and I was like oh my god this is a world
of beauty and like all these tips and
tricks and like a zombie I was like I
took my bike bought my first like
eyeliner mascara and and after three
months I was like you know what let me
film my own would you want to see it I
do my accent was rough that's what I
love about the internet it doesn't
matter where you are but the fact that
you have that when you're 14 I wish I
had a video like that 14 that's really
cute
were you period what are you doing so my
parents didn't know for like the first
two years I would hide it from them and
my mom would be like where's my camera
where's what I can't find my camera be
like oh yeah my brother found a video
and he's like yeah here you go mom and
I'm like I ran away I was so embarrassed
but they loved it and they were like
since when do you speak English they're
like so confused when did you find that
like passion for me I mean I think every
kid except like my mom was always really
into makeup
it's always the mom yeah and so I would
sit in her room and always just try on I
remember I actually got into foundation
first of hers yeah and I would just put
it all over my face and I remember her
walking in like what are you doing
I was like I know now I'm just copying
you and she would wear red lips all the
time I wasn't really into that I was
just into the foundation when I was 14
my dad said you know you girls are gonna
be getting ready to start wearing makeup
a lot and I don't want you guys to look
crazy so I'm gonna put you in a makeup
class by Joe Glasgow I don't know why
Joe Glasgow I think his fiancee at the
time wore that makeup and found a makeup
artist today I remember we went there
they put us in a room kind of like this
with video cameras and lights and then
they did our makeup and explained it as
they did it and then videotaped it and
gave us the VHS tape when we were done
he's so happy I don't know where I bet I
have it somewhere I know I would die to
have this video and we would watch it
and see how to put on concealer but it
was like the heavy duty like studio
makeup it wasn't like just a light
makeup it was like liner
mask oh yeah and then in high school my
friend would always talk to me about
color makeup like glitters and purples
and blues and greens and then she was
like no my dad she didn't really know
her dad growing up and so when she was
in high school she met her dad so her
dad started makeup forever and he wanted
to just pamper her like all the time and
give her all this makeup so hitting me
we'd go they had a store in New York and
we'd go to the store we'd stay at his
apartment in New York with him there and
we would just remember she would just
get me so much free makeup and I just
remember having so much colored makeup I
was so excited your favorite color this
like turquoise color it was like a
turquoise glittery pot yeah
such like a pigmented shimmer and I
would put it underneath my eyes and I
would always wear I made these headbands
these floral headbands and I sold them
at like Fred Segal and all these stores
and
mm-hmm I would do the turquoise flowered
headbands with the turquoise eyeshadow
I'd always matched Burgundy with
burgundy shadow match it to your oh my
god lunch it's in my little flower
headband how did you meet Mario you know
I was doing this shoot and he was the
makeup artist and it was like I don't
even know if I had my show yet or Simon
was like hey do you want to do this
magazine for my friend the cover and at
that time I was like sure anything you
know right and he was the makeup artist
and I guess they called him the night
before I was as well I'm in New York we
might as well just do it yeah he was the
makeup artist and I just he made me feel
and look so like ethnic and Armenian and
like just so different than anyone else
had yeah and I just loved how I looked
actually what we had filmed because I
had worked with other makeup artists to
know the difference I feel like if
there's one thing that we should all be
very thankful for is for you and Mario
taking away the being afraid for makeup
because so many people are like oh my
god yeah what is all of that and I feel
like you guys were like no it's okay
here's how you do it here's how you look
beautiful with them thank you I feel
like if it wasn't for you people
nowadays with contouring or like
anything like foundation concealer would
be like oh thank you yeah we just
I loved makeup and I was like go do
whatever you want like make it smoky
like I really just wanted more and more
and more
I honestly with everything that I've
done I've never worked harder than on
makeup it's crazy but like I see this
brush and going over your eye and I'm
like when I was younger and I thought
wow that's a beautiful smoky eye you
know I'm doing that smoky eye so do you
watch a lot of YouTube videos not even
makeup bullet i watch what's like a
probably 30 YouTube videos a day but all
on opening toys and making slime that is
my life or watch stupid music videos
like the gummy bear
stupid gummy bear song anyone know what
I'm talking about oh just to annoy you
guys I'll know I'll play it for one
second okay this is what I have to watch
you guys 500 times a day this has 1
billion I can't believe I willingly
played that what is it for how easy okay
hunter near troll my eyes are two
different shapes thank God we did the
power of me what was the hardest you're
like okay after all these years of being
obsessed with makeup I want to give it a
go
what was the hardest ones the colors was
it like the consistency well I think at
first doing a line with my sister's
really prepped me like I just really
wanted something that would be perfect
I'd be proud of I'd wear all the time
just like genuinely product that I love
what's your favorite makeup look like
it's like I know what to do we pretty
well we should come out with the
highlighter should have been called
glowy Chloe
such a missed opportunity
have you ever fallen asleep during glam
I've done glam on the floor sleeping
yeah when I was really sick in New York
and I had to film and I'm like I can't
even sit in the chair and I used to lay
down and even if I'm really jet-lagged
in in France I remember sleeping on the
bed and being like doom I wake up and
wake me up when it's over and I had full
under eye concealer bottom everything
mascara I don't know how you do that no
choice oh I have no idea no clue
great not once not once now but I should
catch up we need to talk because I kind
of want to dye my hair blonde and then I
can do that for Halloween
no I'm gonna do differently because I
can do it with the stripes I had no
makeup artist again two stripes I'm
gonna contouring the contour Queen
that's such an interesting technique I
like that I like it because I can really
build up to how far you want it like
your breathing pattern the circles
2009 called
they want Kim back and this is a new
brush that's an angle it's bigger and I
started with powder contour like that's
how I learn but first we're gonna set
the rest in with the lighter powder I'm
setting the light areas of the face so I
blended over the contour tiny bit we're
really gonna want to intensify that so
you're the first person that's using the
brush palette and the palette
yep that's just my one sample palette go
ahead say it you're the first
my face looks so good I'm gonna just see
if you guys I'm literally just gonna see
if you notice eyes
really
I can't work with them I try to but just
a little bit when I'm not using a lot of
highlight yeah you're talking to the
wrong person when I started doing
wearing highlighter with a bare face
Chloe does that to work out people are
like you look amazing girl it's every
time she works out she does it and I
think that's just what I got to do it
just put highlighter with a bare face
and everyone's like yeah they people
don't get it they just think you're
literally glowing yep that's the trick
of all fucking surgery ready for the
blinding that I'm gonna mix I like
mixing this is my favorite part you guys
we're twins this is a pretty major
highlighter Mario doesn't even have this
like I haven't even given it to anyone
anyone I mean that's pretty glowy if you
ask me I can tell it's your thing now
I'm so excited I'm even more excited
tomorrow
snap Kim that's gonna be my trick no
you're not Chloe with the no makeup
working out and highlighter Niki is so
shady she's only doing half my fucking
face she wants me to go out like this
you love it though
I say let's put a lash on you can choose
maybe that one I'm gonna do when I get
home I'm gonna try to recreate the other
side of the face I'll snap it
seriously the power of makeup I can't
wait for that globe to come out it's so
good and that's it guys the power of
makeup on Kim how do you like which one
do you guys like better I'm gonna watch
this tape back so many times to figure
out how to do this mm-hmm I want to try
