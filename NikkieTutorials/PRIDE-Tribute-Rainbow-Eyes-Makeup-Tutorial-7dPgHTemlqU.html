rainbow makeup tutorial for you guys
in honor of Pride Month in this video I
want you to know that it's okay to be
yourself it's okay to love yourself and
for no fucking reason should you hide
who you truly are something absolutely
tragically happened in Orlando and I
just want to say that my thoughts and
love are with the victims and families
of those affected by this tragedy we are
here for you what happened in Orlando is
unacceptable and we cannot let hatred
win and that is why with this video I'm
earning you to bust out every bright
color eyeshadow you have smeared all
over your face and wear it proudly the
LGBT community has always been so
amazing to me and this just felt like
the right thing to do to share the light
on Pride Month to share the light on
positivity colors loving who you are and
not letting hatred win so I know this
video may not mean much but it's my way
of coping with things I want to thank
you so much for watching and if you
would like to know how to get this pride
rainbow makeup look thank you for
watching so I'm gonna start off by
perfecting my skin using the Too Faced
Born This Way Foundation
I'm not highlighting my face using the
Kryolan TV paint stick in double zero
and to further conceal I'll be using the
it cosmetics bye bye under-eye
and again beauty blending that in
now I'm going to set my under eye area
using my NARS
a loose powder in snow and setting the
rest of my face using my double wear
powder by Estee Lauder alright first
thing as always applying a base to my
eyelids to make this rainbow lasts all
day long and I'm using my Mac soft ochre
Paint Pot and I'm applying this using a
sigma 3d HD precision punch now with a
light matte eyeshadow i'm going to set
my crease to brow bone area to help
blending later on so for the eyes i'll
be replicating this rainbow look i
already did but i'm going to reverse two
colors so everything on the bottom is
going to go to the top and the top is
going to go to the bottom mmm so the
first i should I'm going to go in with
is a yellow and this is my melt
cosmetics in the color neon and this is
going on the inner third of the lid up
to the crease
for the orange I'm going to go in with
Mel Cosmetics radon and with that same
brush which is a zoeva 234 I'm applying
this to the center of the lid you want
to softly swipe it into the yellow which
will give it an amazing blend you can
always flip your brush around go back in
with the yellow and again swipe at the
edges for the outer third I'm going to
use melt radioactive and then with a
morphe M 503 brush I'm softly going to
blend out the edges you want to make
sure that the higher you go up with the
brush the less pressure you use to get a
perfect blend I'm quickly going to go
back in with all the colors to really
get the top portion done it now it's
time to focus on the bottom which is
going to be the top of this lid right
here so we're going to start off with
purple and the purple I'll be using is
by this morphe palette right here this
is the 12 P and this purple is life and
I'm applying the purple using a Cosette
D to 3-0 brush
on the center of the lower lash on will
be using this blue I'm going to stop
about halfway in cuz we'll be creating a
new inner corner for the new in a corn
I'll be using this Oprah fixed line
eyeliner gel in black and a dose of
colors fine liner brush which I cut a
couple of bristles off of which makes it
even thinner and more precise alright
right below the new inner corner I'll be
applying this melt green color and this
is called xenon seen on I don't know and
with mixes white liquid liner I'm going
to trace a new inner corner to make it
even more bamming with Jeffrey stars
weirdo liquid lipstick I'll be doing my
Langer today and I'm using that same
dose of colors fine liner brush which I
cut some hairs off
and now with a white eyeshadow I'm going
to highlight my inner corner to finish
off I'll be applying some dramatic
lashes these are literally lashes
caramel alright let's go on to cheeks
the first thing we're going to do is cut
them and show them that our cheekbones
are on fire
I'm gonna use my Kevyn Aucoin and medium
sculpting powder for this and my morphe
M five-thirty
and as always with a zoeva 142 intensify
it right at the base to really show them
who's cheeks are boss
and then with the paste powder go right
underneath right at the edges and at the
base softly to blend it in and your
cheek bones is to lay the game for blush
I'm going to use dx1 pretty in peach for
my glow today I'll be using a
combination of Jeffrey Stehr speech
goddess and ice cold and for this I'm
using my favorite highlighting brush
this is the morphe M 310
tip the nose to get that Raven nose but
for daytime drag of course the Cupid's
bow for loops today I'm first going to
go in with Geoffrey stars
I knew the lure liquid lipstick
and using the tiniest bit of druglord
right on the center to make it a little
bit more of an hombre
