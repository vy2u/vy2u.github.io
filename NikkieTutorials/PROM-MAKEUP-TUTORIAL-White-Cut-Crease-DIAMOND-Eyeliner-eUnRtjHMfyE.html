tutorial on this / Amish makeup look
right here I wanted to create something
very soft and like elegant but still
with like a very fun twist to it so I
did this white matte cut crease with
rhinestone liner and I was crazy
inspired by this post on Twitter my god
that is pure and utter makeup gold this
post by ms artistry miss artistry it is
so stunning so I decided to take a spin
on that and create my own little twist
on that for prom season I think it is so
so cool and without any further ado if
you would like to know how to get this
prom look right here then keep on
watching so before we start with
anything you want to make sure that you
have a very nice moisturised base to
work with I went in with a couple of
moisturizers like an hour before filming
to really let it soak in so I think now
it's time to kick it up the first
product I'll be going in with is by NYX
this is called the angel veil and I've
heard a lot of great things about this
in the comments section so thank you so
much for recommending this to me and
let's try it out it feels very velvety
and soft my only concern is that it
might be a little bit too silicone II
and soft like it might slip around too
much but like overall it feels good for
a foundation I'm going to go in with one
of my all-time favorite combinations the
L'Oreal infallible total cover in 301
with the L'Oreal infallible Pro glow in
201 and I'll be applying this all using
my Sigma Beauty 3d HD Blender
now as you can see this is a very full
coverage combo so if you like it a
little bit more natural or soft by all
means use the foundation that you know
works for it but I feel like for prom
with all those photos taken it doesn't
hurt to use a little bit more coverage
for concealer today I'm going to go in
with the morphe concealer in the color
sand mmm how good this is combo look I
love the look of my skin right now so
now I'm going to make my under eye area
using my dermablend powder just before
we do anything on the eyes it's really
important to prime and my favorite
product for this is Mac soft ochre Paint
Pot and because this is an all matte
look it is really important to now set
that primer so that's a shadow that you
put on over top later on and doesn't
pull or tug anywhere with a medium warm
tone Brown I'm just defining my crease
from inner to outer corner and make sure
you blend the edges with a clean brush
after
now with the Knicks of white gel
eyeliner I'm going to cut the lid and
make sure you do this as precise as
possible I'm also going to go a little
bit above my natural crease so that when
I look straight forward with my hooded
eyes you still see some of the white
peeking through now I'm going to set
that new crease area using a matte white
shadow by Inglot
and I'm softly blending in that crease
color on the outer third of the lid
smoothly blending it into the white now
with NYX is a white liquid liner I'm
going to create a wing and define the
edge of where my new crease is right now
and I'm going to fill the inside of that
white liner up using iridescent green
teal rhinestone first you want to put
down a little bit of glue and then stick
the rhinestone right over top
to open up the eyes some white coal on
the waterline and remember that crease
color I'm also applying that to the
lower lash line and to seal the deal now
going in with lashes these are Lily
lashes lush alright let's focus on the
cheeks now for prom and especially when
you're going for like an event I highly
suggest or recommend warming up your
skin tone because with all the flash
going on all the flash photography going
on it will really blast away most of
your feature so you want to find a nice
balance where you still look sexy as
hell in real life let the flash
photography doesn't blow everything away
so I like to go in with the hoola light
first to a warm up my skin and also give
my cheeks a little bit more structure so
with circular motions I just start
giving my cheeks a little bit more posed
I'll just give it a little bit of warmth
see how that already gives me more life
and also let's not forget about the
forehead and temples and now the choice
is up to you whether you want a little
bit more contouring or not I never say
no to a little bit of extra contouring
so I'm just going to pick up a little
bit and just at the base of that
cheekbone I give it a little more for
blush I'm going to go for a nice peachy
coral to really living up that face and
I'll go in with this wet and wild blush
in pearlescent pink
there's nothing pink about this foot we
can live with it
these blushes
don't sleep on them they're super
pigmented and fur glow I just I'm sorry
I'm getting repetitive I can't get it up
of ever glow oh the relaunch is so close
I cannot wait for you to get your hands
on this if you didn't get it with the
first launch so let's go in with the
lightest part and blind everyone at this
prom you know really remind people that
you are the one that blinded them all
and then I always like to add a little
bit above the brow and right on the
center of the face because it can look a
little bit weird when you have like
really blinding cheeks and the rest of
your face is really matte so I feel like
as a cohesive like finishing touch
adding that above the brow forehead like
a little bit on the chin it really helps
make it more like believable for lips I
think it's really important to go with
something that you feel comfortable with
and that makes do you feel the most
confidence I feel like of course if you
want to wear a red lip or like such a
statement lip and you've never really
done that before
I don't know if prom is like the right
time to try and adventure yourself
because it might make you feel
comfortable or you might not really feel
yourself so I believe that for prom you
should do whatever you want with lips
that makes you feel your best you now
when it comes to me and this is a
well-known fact I love nude lips nude
lips are my obsession like I cannot live
without them
therefore I'm going to go in with one of
my all-time favorite nude lipsticks that
stays and looks beautiful with this look
this is Charlotte Tilbury Kim kW
alright and adding a tiny bit of
definition using a little bit of lip
slinger on this side alright and now to
finish it all off I'm going to set to my
face using this setting spray by
Maybelline called super stay 24-hour and
that my love's concludes this prom
makeup tutorial I hope you enjoyed I
must say I really really love this like
I had so much fun playing with the matte
colors and then the rhinestones I think
it's very elegant but different and
modern so I hope you enjoyed for a full
