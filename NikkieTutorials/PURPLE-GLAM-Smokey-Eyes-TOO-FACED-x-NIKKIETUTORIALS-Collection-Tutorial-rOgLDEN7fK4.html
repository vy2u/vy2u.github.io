video for me because this is the first
video I'll be doing featuring my
two-faced power of makeup collection and
I wanted to show you one of my all-time
favorite looks creating this palette
featuring wham-bam mostly because women
by the Segway one of my top favorite
colors out of the entire collection and
I wanted to show you a look that I love
rocking I love purple but I also wanted
to make it summer ready so I added a
metallic glossy crow lip and I think
this is so cool for like a summer party
you can always leave the lip out and
make it all about the purple add a new
clip at a dark lip you can do whatever
you want with the lips but we're mainly
focusing on this little bit right here
today this is so crazy but for the first
time ever I'm going to show you how the
power of makeup collection featuring to
face in collaboration with me is going
to look like on my actual face in a
tutorial and this is crazy and oh my god
yeah if you would like to know how to
get this summer ready party summer party
makeup look right here then please keep
on watching alrighty so the first thing
I'll be doing today is using a
moisturizer slash primer I'm going to be
using the glam glow glow starter in nude
glow like I told you in my previous
video this is life I know some of you
went out and bought this after my
previous video and can we just talk
about this scent it is truly honestly
like an orange creamsicle and it is
everything you're just going to buff
that in using my fingers and it will
give us a beautiful luminous glow to
work with and dis foundation and
concealer just glides on beautifully
with this as a base for foundation today
I'm going to go in with the hourglass
these are brand new vanish Foundation
sticks look like that I'm using the
color alabaster on the outer perimeter
of my face
and porcelain on the inner and it's
actually my first time trying these but
so far just playing them to my face
coverage for days I've never felt so
beautiful and then with the hourglass
vanish foundation stick brush I'm going
to buff this all in all right I must say
the coverage of this is unreal look at
that it covers anything for concealer
I'll be using the new Tarte shaped tape
concealer in fair
the first thing I'll be doing for my
eyes is priming them using my Mac soft
ochre Paint Pot and using the color IV
I'm going to set my brow bone to crease
area to help lending later on I'm going
to be using the color justify my love as
my transition color in my crease and for
this and using a morphe m5o to brush
now going to go in with wham bam and
this is going on the inner and outer
third of my lid plus in the crease and
I'm first going in with a zoeva two
three four brush and with my morphe M
514 brush I'm going to drag that into
the crease and when you feel like the
Purple's taking over a little bit too
much you can always go back in with that
pink and bring intensify to make it all
nice and on the little bit playing
sugar-coated
I'll be highlighting my inner corners
using irresistible and frosted YUM
on the lower lash I'll be going in with
makeup and Chia one of my favorite
colors of this palette and smoking that
in using my morphe M 508 one of my
favorite bushes on this planet and my
goal is here to create a very sexy smoky
lower lash line and makeup and chill is
perfect for that same brush and wham-bam
continuing smoking out that lower lash
line and with the tips of the 508 brush
you're going to create a new inner
corner and highlighting the inner
corners using frosted yum again on the
center of my lid I'll be applying
glitter elite glitter from the Too Faced
set
to seal the deal I'll be applying some
lashes and these are Koko lashes in
goddess
alright time for cheeks now putting a
lot of purples and Pink's on the eyes
can really drain the face so it's time
to bring back that life and time to cut
those cheeks I first got to go in with
my Kevin Kwan Lite sculpting powder to
contour using my morphe m5 30 brush and
then following through with my 140 brush
bys the wave of picking up morphed the
contour powder tap-tap and right at the
base of the contour you really want to
intensify it to cut that cheek and then
with your face powder go underneath
around it and even at the base
tap-tap-tap clean it up make it sharp
and to quickly contour the nose I'm
going to go into my favorite nose
contouring brush the morphe 47 and i
showed you this in my previous video you
just want to take a tiny bit of powder
and create two lines hello this is going
to Who am I speaking to and then with
that same brush I'm so lightly and
lightly gonna buff that in and out
and then with the some face powder and a
brush go over top to really really
soften it and take like half of that
down you will be left with a snatch no
all right I'm going to further bronze up
my face and bring back that life using
be chocolate silly brown during the
palette and very lightly start warming
up the tops of the cheekbones center of
the forehead chin area top of now let's
just give yourself that sunkissed look
for blush I'm going to go in with I will
always love you and for highlighter
today I want that really ethereal sort
of magical glow so for this I'm going to
go in with the moon child glow kit by on
excessively Hills and I first gonna go
in with pink art which is like a pinky
color then I'm gonna highlight the tip
of my nose using star which is more of
like a a true silver you know I'm all
about that intense like beacon of light
on the tip of my nose okay and I
actually want that everywhere thank you
I'm going to put blue ice I'm like
mixing this entire palette on my face
I'm mixing blue ice on my cube oh my
therefore lips I want something nude but
peachy to kind of tie in with the cheek
since you livin up the face so I'm gonna
go in with one of my favorite new brands
is you way and this is their lip cream
in pêche which is peach in French and I
probably butchered that
now I'm going to use one of my favorite
glosses a lipped hopper buys you a
called skinny dip this stuff is just ah
and to lock it all and place some chill
setting spray by urban decay and that
