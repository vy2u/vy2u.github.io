so yeah without any further ado if you
would like to know how to get this
purple holidays glam makeup look then
keep on watching all right as always the
first thing I'm gonna do is prime my
face using my Nivea men aftershave balm
insensitive and it is key to keep
blending it in until it starts feeling
tacky so it's really tacky now and
that's when you know you're good to go
and I want like to follow through using
my Urban Decay all nighter makeup
setting spray I'll be using my favorite
foundation today as that will give me
the most flawless finish and I'm talking
about my Make Up For Ever Ultra HD
foundation Stix
I'm applying 1:20 to the outer
perimeters of my face and 117 to the
inner
and blend it all in using a beauty
blender
for concealer I'll be using the it
cosmetics bye bye under-eye in light and
then again blend in using a beauty
blender and then setting everything with
powder to prevent it from creasing this
shouldn't come as a surprise but the
first thing I'll be using is my Mac soft
ochre Paint Pot to prime my eyelids now
with a matte nude eyeshadow I'm setting
my brow bone area and this will help
lending all the colors later on for my
crease I'll be taking this color right
here from this is you a ready-to-wear
warm collection eyeshadow palette with
an Anasazi Beverly Hills eyes shadow
brush and buffing that into the crease
now going into the other saucier Rivoli
Hill selfmade palette and I'm taking the
color hot chocolate and with a morphe M
503 I'm deepening my crease so I first
pack the hot chocolate eyeshadow on and
blend out later for the little using
pink champagne and applying it with a
damp brush
for the iconic purple I'm taking deep
purple and also applying that with a
damp brush
now you one is slightly blent deep
purple into hot chocolate so you get rid
of that gap here
and then deepening again using hot
chocolate on the inner corners I'll be
applying some Urban Decay's polyester
bright eyeshadow and now all you want to
do is grab the look a little bit more by
using some black eyeshadow and fading it
in between the roots of your lashes to
finish up the look I'm going to do is
apply some falsies and these are the
Ardell wispies all ride cheeks now I
don't really remember what I did that
day but we're gonna make it work
we're gonna make something cool out of
these cheeks so first I'm going to
contour using my lorac pro contour
palette and I'm using the lightest shade
course and to contour with I'll be using
the elf blush brush
to highlight I'll be using my honest
answer briefly Hills illuminator in
starlight and I saw desi wet her
highlighter brush before applying her
highlighter and that mayor highlighter
go boom boom and I want my highlighter
to be boom boom so I'm gonna wet that
brush and then
mm-hmm
yes and for blush going to use my
favorite combination Sigma's pet name
and Nymphaea aura powders and I wanted
to do now to lock this all in is spritz
your face with a makeup finishing spray
for lips I'm of course going to use this
awesome Kat Von D combination so the
first color I'll be applying is bow and
arrow and over top of that is a Requiem
