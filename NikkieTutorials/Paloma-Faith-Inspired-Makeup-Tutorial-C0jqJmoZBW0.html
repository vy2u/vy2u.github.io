and I have collaborated on a great new
makeup look inspired by the artwork from
my album a perfect contradiction make
sure you stay tuned to see how you could
create the look for yourself hey guys so
as Paloma just said today I am creating
a look inspired by the artwork of
Palomas new album a perfect
contradiction and I am the cult leader
and the cult leader is known for being
the bad guy I was especially inspired by
his clothes the red I love the red and
apparently the cult leader bought a new
Rolex so that is why I have the gold on
my eyelids so I tried to come up with
these really abstract mysterious cat
eyes with the gold from the Rolex and
then the lips of course inspired by his
clothes I am so excited to bring you
this tutorial so without any further ado
let's go already let's get started hey
I'm first priming my face using the
Becca shimmering skin Perfector in pearl
and applying this all over my face now
I'm going in with my benefit hello
flawless foundation one of my favorite
foundations at the moment and I'm just
first applying it to the skin and then
buffing it in using a sigma foundation
brush oh my god recovering my lip now
going in my favorite concealer which is
max Pro Longwear in NC 15 and I'm just
applying this underneath my eyes and on
the highest points of my face to
highlight
okay
giving you over
now quickly setting my under eye area
using some powder and now I'm going in a
cream color base by Mac this is bamboo
and I'm applying that's because I really
like the peachy orange feel it gives I
especially went for that creamy peachy
feeling because I liked what kind of
twisted gave to my face
Oh
I'm quickly going to do my brows
off-camera and also my other eye this is
my way of making the clear okay on to
ice first I'm applying my base which is
my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot and then
going in with makeup geeks a Peach
Smoothie and applying this to my crease
and this is going to be my crease
transition color now mixing Coco bear
and Peach Smoothie by makeup geek and
applying this to the inner corners of my
eyes to get the inner parts of my eye
sockets more definition I'm going in
makeup geeks eyeshadow in mocha and I'm
applying this as a base for my eyeliner
and I'm sort of sketching out where I
want my cut crease to go to with this
Hey look I can make
now I'm taking Coco bear and this is
going to be right in between color so
it's the color in between Peach Smoothie
and a dark brown mocha and with this
you're going to start blending it out
Nats again makeup gigs corrupt which is
a matte black I'm sketching out the cut
crease even more and I'm finally placing
more definition where I wanted to be so
what I like to do is first sort of
sketching out where I wanted to go and
then with a brush blend it out next up
I'm going in a pigment by makeup geek
this is a liquid gold and I'm applying
it damp to the inner and outer corners
of my lid and with this I'm actually
cutting my crease however now going in
blonds gold pigment by Mac and also
playing this damp to the middle of my
lid and I'm mixing this with the liquid
gold
with my calf and a tattoo liner in
trooper I am doing my winged eyeliner
and I was going for this really nice cat
shaped evil look so I applied that
little pointy to my inner corners and
then just fill it in and with this I'm
also Reedy tailing that cut crease part
just make it a little bit more neat and
and sharp I'm now going in makeup
studios jewel effects in shine and I'm
also applying this damn to the middle
part of my lid above the eyeliner with
makeup geeks mocha I am defining the
lower lash line and then with the Kat
Von D liner I'm connecting that inner
part with the bottom lash line and then
smoking and blending my lower lash line
out with Peach Smoothie
I'm going back in with corrupt to get
the lower lash line a little bit more
definition and then finish off with
false lashes these are by makeup studio
and those are the number Five's for Mike
on trial be using my honest as a Beverly
Hills contour kit and from the kid I'm
taking the most cool tone shade then I'm
going in Sigma's powder blush in cheeky
one of my favorites
this man and then right after that I'm
using my Becca shimmering skin perfecter
pressed in opal this is a new one for me
and apply that to the highest points of
my face and I adore this glow right here
and then because for this look I wanted
some ultra glow I'm going over top with
my Ben Nye limnia luxe powder in ice for
my lips I'm using my Kat Von D
everlasting liquid lipstick in outlaw
and that is the first color I'll be
applying
and then I decided that I wanted the
lips a little bit darker so I went to
over top with another Kevin D
everlasting liquid lipstick and this is
called Vampira or Vampira I don't know
