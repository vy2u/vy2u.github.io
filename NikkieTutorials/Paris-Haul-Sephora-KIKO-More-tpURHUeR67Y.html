and I decided it was time to do a haul
because I haven't done a haul in so long
so last Friday I went to Paris with my
boyfriend and we went really early so we
could see Paris all day long and then in
the night I had an event for a L'Oreal
with the new launch of a new perfume
from Cacharel and then the rest of
Saturday we had the entire day in Paris
as well so that was two days in Paris
and I of course did some shopping I mean
of course I did some shopping so I
bought some Kiko which I was really
surprised about because they had that
like at the corner of the street my
hotel was in when - of course Sephora um
I went to LA today oh and today I'm here
to show you okay so the first thing I'm
going to show you is the NARS narcissist
I palette a lot of makeup brands have
been dropping the neutral palettes like
hot potatoes lately so uh nurse decided
to give it a go as well and they came up
with this narcissist eye palette a
pellet with 15 shadows full of shimmery
mattes
cool cool and warm toned neutral shades
I did a full blog post review on this
palette so if you want to see that go to
my blog nikkietutorials comm I love this
palette so much it's so pretty it's a
great palette it was only 50 euros and
I'm over the moon with this I love this
palette I also went to Make Up For Ever
and I saw another miss fame it's like
every video where I do not do a makeup
tutorial about Miss fame and her
tutorials I love missing so miss fame
did another tutorial and in this she
showed that she uses Makeup Forever aqua
liners to sort of map out eyeliners and
the inside of the eye
if drag queens use it to keep something
on it works because they have to perform
and they have to dance on lip sync from
their lives so if they choose to go for
a product it works so I already had fee
maker Forever aqua liner in red and I
already loved that because it didn't get
off um but I never really made the link
to get a black one as well that would
stay on all day so I got the black aqua
liner by Makeup Forever and it's so good
it's so waterproof it's so smudge proof
I'm wearing it as
black eyeliner today I love it it's so
nice get it next from benefit I got the
Gimme brow because I heard oceanic so
talk about it or her Chloe Murillo talk
about it I heard so many people talk
about the Gimme brow by benefit so I got
light/medium I'm not sure yet if I
really love it I'm wearing it on my
grass today I'm not the shape or
anything that's powder but like the
hairs have this gel on it
it definitely makes your hairs a little
bit more full and it definitely gives it
color but I don't feel like it's um
what's good it's really good but I get
my glove hasn't sparkled up for you
maybe it will come don't know so far
I've used it for two days now it's okay
I'm not like like gobsmacked by it but
um it looks good I think that's all I
got at Sephora actually so let's just go
to the Kiko stuff I am obsessing over
Kiko it has such amazing products it's
so cheap and just the quality of the
shadows and just everything you buy from
them is so good and so pigmented and it
stays on like a dream and it applies
like a dream I love Kiko
so Kiko had this new spring/summer
collection out and it were really bright
sort of cute colors so I couldn't pass
out on that let's just start with the
palette I'm working on a full review on
these from the blog as well so keep an
eye out on nikkietutorials um for
reviews on these I said these are the
street fashion Palace I believe they had
four colors I got two of them the first
one is number one harmonic swing and I
love the packaging it's just I love it
and then when you open it up it looks
like thought so number one has really
nice smoky earthy tones colors and I
love this its pigmented it's implies
like a dream it's amazing it's amazing
ah then the second one I got is number
two and this is addictive song weird
name and this is actually my favorite
from the two I got oh look at that Nicki
colors because you got your warm Browns
you're sort of more egg plenty red dark
colors your Gold's a pinky color a dark
on color.this like this is amazing I
love it
so much and so beaming teeth these
colors apply like butter another palette
but not in the street fashion collection
is the color impact eyeshadow palette I
think for the color impact line they
have like three editions of pellets I
got number two Street tub variation
again I love the packaging it's it's
different it's you don't see this
happening a lot and it just has like the
most amazing shimmery glittery top coat
I shadows are wearing this color right
here on my lids today and I would
definitely use these as sort of like a
top coat or shadow so if you put like a
medium brown base on your linen you pop
this on top you will really get that
shimmer and that's showing that it has
it has one matte color um I love these
then going back to the street fashion
collection they also had amazing eye
pencils and I got three of them these
are the Kiko skinny fit Kajol's again I
love the packaging I love the boxes they
come in this is number two and this is a
mint green eye pencil it's super duper
pigmented it's so soft is so creamy you
blend it out like a dream but it kind of
sets in a little bit as well I don't own
a mint eye pencil and the fact that Kiko
had it just made me scream in the store
I was so happy and I love this color
then I also have number three which it's
when I opened it up is a sort of more
sky-blue color perfect for spring
perfect for summer for example if you
pop this on your waterline and keep the
rest of your look really natural and you
have naturally blue eyes your blue eyes
will pop so much like this is a trick
that I don't remember her name quite
exactly but it spends her sister on the
hills
I think it's deafening she has to do
this all the time by just keeping the
rest of her eyes really natural and then
popping a bright blue liner on her
waterline and it just made her eyes pop
so much I loved it then lastly I got
number four this is another skinny fit
Kajal and this
is a it's a really bright royal blue
color it's sort of like a um it's royal
blue but a little bit more neon and a
little bit more interesting this will be
great as a base for like a really a blue
eyeshadow that doesn't really like do
much and then when you apply this as
amazing it works and just on waterline
and it's an eyeliner and I love this
color
are they not called street fashion oh I
just saw that the palettes are called
street fashion the eye pencils are
called skinny fit and now the lip
product is called rock Idol so I'm not
sure what the collections name is it's
just a spring/summer collection that is
in stores right now onto the lip product
this is the rock Idol lipstick in number
one and these are really matte sort of
satiny lip pencils they look like the
ones from Clinique and all the other
brands that have been copying and such
and such so this is number one a perfect
pretty nude colored oh yeah get one then
I also bought by the mascara department
I already had a super caller mascara by
Kiko in a burgundy red kind of color but
then I saw the purple one and you know
my love for lilac and purple and all
kind of tones of purple so when I saw
the Kiko super color mascara number one
purple I my mind was blown it is so
pigmented it is so bright it is so
amazing I sound like I'm on repeat but
this is something I love Kiko so much it
makes me so excited and then another
mascara that I saw is a top coat mascara
so they had different sort of versions
and and types and they have one for
lengthening they have one for volumizing
separating a top coat to make it like
hardcore waterproof I got the green one
and this is the false lashes concentrate
lengthening top coat mascara and it has
sort of like many tiny particles of
fibers in it that when you apply this
over your lashes that the fibers sort of
mini hairs
catch onto the latch that kind of
lengthens it I can't
really really say that I see like a huge
difference and I quickly want to talk
about the perfumes that I got at the
event from L'Oreal for Cacharel and they
relaunched a new perfume called na e on
e and they included the original scent
that has been way old and I smelled them
at the event and this is definitely a
more um I don't want to say dated but a
little bit more old powdery scent and
then the new one is the unnie unnie
pimia Billy's a new type of scent and
new edition of it and this is definitely
much younger and more fresh and more
flowery I haven't opened it yet because
I'm saving it for later this year when
it gets a little bit hotter in the
country yeah that kind of concludes it
all I loved Paris I love the Eiffel
Tower
CHUM's Elysees holy crap a moly amazing
been there three times and I had so much
fun with my boyfriend and we really
enjoyed it see that concludes my Paris
haul I hope you enjoyed for a full list
