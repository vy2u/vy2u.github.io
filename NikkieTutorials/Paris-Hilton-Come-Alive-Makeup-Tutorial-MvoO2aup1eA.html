inspired by Paris Hilton's and new music
video come alive and she is wearing some
awesome makeup looks throughout this
entire video I absolutely adore the look
that she has on when she's like swinging
on that flower swing it's just so
glamorous and so girly and beautiful but
I thought for today to punch it up a bit
and go for that really beautiful blue
smokey cut crease look that she was
wearing now it was I filmed this video
yesterday as well and it kind of filled
all at once it was so hard for me to
exactly pinpoint what parents was
wearing until I found the Instagram page
of the makeup artist that fit this look
on Paris and I could actually see
real-life shots and the color in her
crease was actually a lot darker and
more intense so then I immediately knew
what to do with this entire look yeah if
you want to know how to get this Paris
Hilton come alive inspired look then
please keep on watching so the first
thing I'll be doing is applying a base
lash primer to of course give my face
something to work with and for that I'm
gonna make a mixture with my max prep
and prime and natural radiance in
radiant yellow and for that extra bit of
glow I'm gonna go with my Becca
shimmering skin Perfector in opal and
I'm just gonna apply the two with my
fingers then because I'm having a little
bit of a dry skin day I'm gonna go for a
more wet foundation that hasn't got a
lot of powder in it I'll be using my Mac
face and body foundation in c1 for this
and to give it a little bit more
coverage I'm mixing in a little bit of
my Mac select cover-up concealer in nw15
and first I'm just dotting that mixture
onto my face and then with my Sigma SAT
brush I'm going to start buffing this in
to further perfect the face I need some
concealer and I will be using the mac
prolongwear concealer in NC 15 for this
and that is going underneath the eyes
and I'm going to buff this the end using
my Sigma F 86 I'm now off camera going
to set this with a little bit of powder
I'm going to use my chanel natural is
finished powder and number 20 Clair and
also do brows and one eye off-camera and
then I will be back
so I already applied to basically my
eyelids to prevent the AI from creasing
and I use my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot
and the first eyeshadows I'll be using
are by Mac and this is contrast and deep
truth and I'm going to be applying these
two on my lower lash line and I'm going
all the way in and all the way out and
then with a little smudgy brush I'm
going to buff that in and diffuse the
edges with those same two colors
I'm making a winged line and I'm
thickening this part up right here and
then from there you want to cut the
crease by drawing a line into your
crease I'm a little bit high up so I'm
going to thicken it and pull it down and
then you just want to continue pulling
that line in and we're going all the way
to the very inner corner and now what
I'm going to do is thicken this up and
give it a little bit more volume and
depth then that with Mac's
copperplate and the teeny tiny bit of
kit I'm going to take a big fluffy
blending brush
and apply those two shades as my
transition blending color right above
that cut crease align that we just
created I know it should have done this
before then now going back into the blue
colors and it's time to buff those out
because we want it to be smoky but cut
and differently don't neglect this inner
corner right here and some love as well
for the lid I'll be taking naked 3 by
Urban Decay and I'll be using trick
that's going ride on the lid leading up
to that cut crease line and you want to
fill this entire blank spot in with that
because Paris had this really nice
duochrome cool tone shimmer at the
middle of her lids I'll be taking sugar
pills a Lewis pigment lose eyeshadow in
lieu me and I'll be applying this over
top just in the middle of the lid
reading up to their crease and that just
gives such a nice unexpected twist I
love that now for that inner corner
Sparkle I was taking my makeup studio
dual effects and shine and lightly dust
that on the inner corners now for the
nice touch of a rhinestone at the end of
the wing of the cup crease I have this
little sheet full of rhinestones I'm
just going to take one and pop one right
at the end of that wing right here and
they're self-adhesive so you don't need
any glue I'll be now applying some
mascara this is my makeup studio
waterproof in 3d extra black and for
lashes I'm going to go with the XO
Beauty Romantics and for lower lashes at
these makeup studio false eyelashes in
number 17
so for cheeks you want to go sculpted
and with a really nice touch of purpley
pink so you know what's coming right now
I don't even know why I still tell you
at this point what I'm using
but for contouring heroine I shadow by
Illamasqua
I also really don't have to tell you
what I'll be using to warm up my face
even more but I will its LMS cos disobey
like a broken record okay and just some
extra warms up in that face then for
blush I'm going to take the Mac blush
ombre in azalea blossom and I'm going to
go right in the middle so where the the
lilac and the baby pink meets and just
add that into the cheek mix give that a
nice pop of pink and then to highlight
we're going to make a mixture with Mac's
mineralize skinfinish in soft and gentle
and x-dimension skinfinish in suburb and
just apply that to the highest points on
my gorgeous sexy paris hilton come alive
makeup tutorial
glowy cheekbone Paris's lips were super
super nude with a little bit of gloss
and a little bit more volume around it
by adding some shadows so I'll be using
the Mac lip pencil in stripped down to
give my lips a little bit massage for
lipstick I'm going to go with Mac's a
myth
and then for a gloss on top I'll be
using the NYC Behr Brooklyn 100 expert
last lip lacquer so that concludes my
Paris Hilton come alive inspired makeup
