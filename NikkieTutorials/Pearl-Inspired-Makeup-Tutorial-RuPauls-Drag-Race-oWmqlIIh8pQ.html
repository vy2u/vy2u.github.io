hey guys thank you so much for watching
and welcome to the first installment of
my drag race RuPaul's Drag Race Season 7
series this look today is inspired by
pearl on the runway that look stole me
from the outfit to the hair to that
amazing outstanding makeup pearls look
was my favorite this week so I decided
that installment number one for this
drag race season 7 series was going to
be on pearl on the runway look I had so
much fun recreating this one so I didn't
have anything that looked like what
pearl is wearing right here so I just
got nifty broke a part of necklace this
happened see without any further ado
let's get started if you want to know
how to get this pearl runway inspired
makeup look then please keep on watching
where we're going to work today is put
down a base which is going to be my
foundation and then do brows do one eye
and then come back in with concealer
we're going to use lots of glitters
today because pearl use the Mac 3d
silver glitter and because that will
probably create some fallout it's
smarter to do foundation first and
concealer after and that way you can
hide all your fallout so I'm going to
mix two phoenicians together the first
one is by Mac and this is Studio Fix
fluid in NC 15 and I'll be mixing that
with the benefit hello flawless
foundation and I'm pure for sure at
first I'm just dotting this unto my face
and with these away val 104 a buffer
brush i'll be buffing this in
now I'm going to move on to brows I'm
going to do them off-camera but I am
going to try and tilt them a little bit
higher up because pearls brows are
really high up and arched so to get
ourselves started the first thing I'll
be doing is applying a base in my lids
to prevent everything from creasing I'm
of course using the soft ochre Paint Pot
by Mac then what you want to do is take
a dark colored eyeshadow and an angled
brush and map out where you want your
wing to go to I personally always aim
towards the end of my eyebrows then drag
that down so I got a little bit of a
shape going I'm going to drag that down
into the crease and then now using the
same products we're going to create a
new crease and then on the sides kind of
whisk it out like this and I'm going to
take my Kevin eat a two liner in trooper
and I'm going to map out a new eyelid so
we're going to do is create this super
thick winged eyeliner that covers the
entire lid and that will make it
optically look like a new eye
then I'm going to fill this entire space
in using my NYC liquid liner in black
and make sure you get every little nook
and cranny then while I'm at it I'm also
going to set it using black eyeshadow
this is corrupt by makeup geek okay now
we're going to work on defining that new
crease a little bit more and taking
sugar pills poison plum and this will be
my crease color so I'm just going to
pack that on on my new crease and start
diffusing it up and out
and with max vibrant grape I'm going to
blend this all out
now with a little bit of black eyeshadow
I'm going to intensify that deepest part
of that new crease even more okay once
we mostly have built our new crease it's
time for the fun part the glitter and
the glitter I'll be using is Mac's a 3d
silver
okay so first I'm laying down a base
this is lits clearly liquid glitter base
then I dip my brush into that glitter
and I put it right on top and you'll be
doing this all throughout the space that
hasn't got anything on it yet and now
what I like to do is go back in with the
purple and the black and just neaten up
the lines a little bit more as you can
see the glitter kind of drizzled down
onto the black and we don't want that so
we're just going to perfect everything
again
so now in order to continue on towards
the lower lashline a first applying
concealer and letting it set I'm cooking
it so that I won't get any creasing so
for my under eye area today I'm going to
go into my mac prolongwear concealer and
then to just highlight it a bit more I'm
taking this Kryolan tv pain stick in
white and I'm buffing this in using my
Real Techniques sponge and then quickly
setting that with powder to let it cook
now using a black eye shadow you want to
create a new inner corner tear duct area
now the same colors I used in my crease
are also going on my lower lash line I
want to connect that to the black right
here and now you want to go batshit
crazy and blend this out like no other
you want it to go super low super smoked
out and blended I'm even now taking
vibrant grape and just smoking that out
super softly and also smoking it right
next to that wing and you guys sit on
that inner part that doesn't have any
products on it yet we're going to apply
the same glitter that we used in the
creased
all right now for lashes I'm going to
stack two together the base flash is
going to be max number two to look like
this
I'm going to stack them using the XO
Beauty feline lashes okay so we've done
all that now it's time to beat this face
so I'm going to contour today using
creams and powders because we're doing
drag today so the cream contour I'm
going to use is by Anastasia Beverly
Hills this is the light contour cream
kits and I'll be using this color right
here to contour with then also my
forehead can't miss that
and because the contour cream is on the
warmer side I'm cooling it down with the
powder later on okay and then with the
YTV paint stick I'm going to highlight
who we got that on now I'm going to set
this all with powder set it all in place
okay and now with my Mac contouring
powders I'm just going to intensify
where I feel like I need more and
highlight where I need more and just
sculpt the space then for blush I'm
going to go for this color pup super
shock cheek in between the sheets mm-hmm
and of course I need a little bit of
nose contouring Who am I kidding a lot
of notes contouring
and then lightly highlight again of
course we also need highlighter and for
this I'm using my Becca shimmering skin
Perfector in moonstone I want to say
pearl her lips pearl where this super
cool toned met jar brown lips so I'm
going to make a mixture between my
essence a long-lasting eye pencil in hot
chocolates and Max lip pencil in stone
and that's all no gloss and lipstick
whatsoever just the two pencils hey you
want these lips to be large and in
charge
yes and I'll slap a wig on and you're
done
