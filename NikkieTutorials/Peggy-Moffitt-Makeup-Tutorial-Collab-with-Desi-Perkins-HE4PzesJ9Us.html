with the amazing deci Perkins here on
YouTube she's one of my absolute
favorite youtubers because everything
about her videos is perfection so we
came up with this makeup inspired by an
icon collab idea
and so deci did this amazing look
inspired by Sofia Lauren and I feel like
there's always got to be this one crazy
bitch in a collab and that's me
of course because look at me so deci did
Sofia Lauren and I did peggy moffitt and
peggy moffitt for me is these sixties
icon peggy moffitt is all about the eyes
she made her eyes huge like like bombard
eclis huge that's not a word I know this
look is absolutely crazy but this could
be perfect for like Halloween
or like an icon inspired party I
probably should label this is Halloween
if you want to know how to get this
peggy moffitt look then please keep on
watching and definitely don't forget to
take out Dusty's Sophia Loren video I
will put all the links in the info box
below and check her out and show her
love okay guys so the first thing I'll
be doing is applying a primer / base to
my face base in my face and we're
talking peggy moffitt today and peggy
moffitt is the 60s and in the 60s there
there just there was no shine there were
no nice and glowy cheekbones there was
it a nice glowy Cupid's bow there wasn't
a radiant glow coming from with it no it
was matte and powder so I based it I
really like to use but doesn't add too
much glow or shine is from Chanel and
this is Leblanc and I'll be just
applying this all over my face the same
goes for a foundation you don't want
something that has a lot of natural
shine to it you don't want something
that looks too wet so you kind of want
to go for something semi met and for
that I'll be using my L'Oreal True Match
and this is the color end one I will
first be placing dots all over my face
to get me started and then with my Sigma
f80 brush I'm gonna buff that in
of course deci is doing Sofia Loren and
everyone knows her and I feel like I'm
like the the underdog that nobody knows
I'm doing peggy moffitt
which i have like a slight obsession for
and I have a feeling because you never
see peggy moffitt tutorials on youtube
so I kind of have this feeling like
everyone is gonna be like who the f are
you doing in this video like it's Peggy
Buffett I like her better than Twiggy so
it's okay you're forgiven if you do not
know who Peggy Moffitt is but I do want
you to after this video check out
interviews check out her photo shoots
because Peggy Moffitt is a legend okay
so once that is on it's time for
concealer and you definitely want that
flawless flawless face because Peggy and
a lot of sixties models have this really
perfected base that was really matte and
really just it was like a blank canvas I
am going to apply my Mac Pro Longwear in
NC 15 dude dude and I'm buffing this in
using my Sigma F 86 okay now comes the
time to do powder and brows and for
powder I'll be using my natural loose
finish powder by Chanel and this is
number 20 Clair it's kind of a mystery
what was on Peggy's brows because the
hair that asymmetrical bob was it was
covering everything it basically hid her
crease and because I do not have a wig
or my hair doesn't look like that I'm
gonna give it a little bit of a spin
today I tried to find pictures of what
Peggy Moffitt's brows actually look like
and I found a picture and they're super
super full and strong I'm like you have
brows under there girl so I'm just gonna
do my brows and make them a little bit
more fuller and stronger and I'm gonna
do that all off-camera now to save some
time and then it will be back okay so
the first thing I want to be doing is
applying a white base this is a jumbo
pencil by NYX and this is called milk
and just blending that in with my finger
then I'm going over top with a matte
white eyeshadow to make it even more
start a light and intense and I'm going
all the way up to the brows now I'm
going to take a little bit of this been
night pigment in ice and I'm applying
that over the white to give it a little
bit of a sheen and again going all the
way to the top no I'm gonna map out
where I want all my lengths to go with a
matte black eyeshadow so I started off
with this line right here and when you
look straight forward you kind of wanted
to lay straight like vertical on your
eyes and then it goes into this really
high up beau arch clumping then I did my
eyeliner line here connected this to
this made my eyeliner blended it out did
some a whole lot of MAGIX
but that is basically how I did it now I
am gonna speed forward through this
because you don't want to talk through
this you want all the concentration to
be at the lines
now it's a really small pencil brush I'm
taking some of that black and I'm gonna
blend it out at the highest points right
here you just want to buff that line out
on top and then kind of blend the edges
towards the sides and then taking a
brush with nothing on it and diffusing
those edges even more now with black
eyeliner I am going to do the line at
top so I'm just gonna make it really
thick and connected to this outer part
right here
so I'm going back with my black
eyeshadow and I'm gonna create this new
inner corner so this new inner corner
it's created by we did this first is by
pulling this straight down and then you
kind of want to make it a point by going
like that you also want to drag that
black shadow all the way so that it
meets up right here and then kind of
coat your roots of your lashes with it
so for the lower lash that's what it did
was drawn in with my Catrice liquid
liner in dating Jo black you just want
to have fun with the lower lashes I mean
you want to place the ones in the middle
going downwards and the more you get to
the sides you want to match them up with
the sides
now for the white to really open up that
eye because that white is what does the
trick to the eye I'm gonna take this Mac
acrylic paint and this is in white and
with that you want to fill up this
entire space this entire new inner
corner that we created so because Peggy
had a lot of under eye jewelry going on
in her photo shoots I'll be taking these
sequins big old silver ass sequins and
I'm gonna pop on right under these crazy
lashes taking a little bit of glue I
want it right there and then simply let
it fall to the ground
and you got some lower I jewelry going
on okay now it's time for mascara and
lashes you definitely want to apply some
lashes because I mean no so the lashes
he'll be applying are by avalor and
these are the strike a pose Peggy
muffets cheeks really didn't get a lot
of love back in the day because all the
attention and I guess time heads go to
these babies right here so what I'll be
doing for my cheeks is giving myself a
little bit more sculpture and a little
bit more you know definition using a
contour shade this is LMS cos heroine
eyeshadow you don't want it take this
too far but definitely do want to carve
out my cheeks a little bit more and
Peggy didn't really wear any type of
blush although it did come across one
shot where she had blush placed right on
the place where we would highlight
nowadays so I'm gonna take a really nice
sweet baby pink color this is by Mac and
this is the Azalea blossom blush ombre
and where we would nowadays highlight is
where her blush was right here isn't
that awesome
I love how you know how things changed
throughout the years
Peggy's lips always were very very nude
like her skin color and with a really
nice gloss on top
so for lips you want to completely blank
them out and I'm gonna go with my new
favorite this is the new glimmer
lipstick by Illamasqua Inti's no lip
liner or whatsoever you just want to
make them nude and then for clothes are
gonna go with whitening lightening lip
gloss in a shimmer of hope such a
beautiful color and that guys concludes
