new video today as you can see I am NOT
in my usual setup item actually in the
hamper whip making this is so crazy
exciting to me because this is actually
the start of a brand new series on my
channel here I want to introduce you to
my newest series glow around the world
as you know is follow me on Twitter and
snapchat you see that I'm pretty much on
a plane every other week and I love
sharing my journey with you and like my
stories so I was like why not bring out
my setup and film on location all
throughout the world and chitchat and
get ready and talk about life these are
like the perfect videos to put on in the
morning and do our makeup together and
it's just here to chill and to get to
know each other a little bit better so
about any further ado I'm going to go
right ahead and do my makeup I have a
lot of new Maybelline stuff here so I am
going to be trying a lot of it out I
don't know if it's going to work out for
me but we'll see and we're just going to
go for it nice glam look alright so
first I'm going to prime using the
jae-hwan jelly packs there is nothing
like it it is makeup glue I'm going to
follow that up using a little bit of the
morphe spray look at stuff so recently
my dark circles have been out of this
world I've been traveling so much where
my dark circles are now at a point where
it looks crazy so I'm going to try this
out is my first time trying it it is
called the Maybelline master camo and
number 15 it is an apricot color for
dark circles for like medium skin tones
so right on Ed's dark area Rama I knew
this I never do this so this feels
really weird for me my life has been
pretty damn crazy lately it's been a
ride there has been a lot of ups and
downs for sure and it's like hard for me
to talk about personal stuff because I
consider myself a private when you meet
me I'm an open book like when I go into
a friendship I give it my all like I
tell it my all like I give you my
everything but you know with you too
I maybe I make the decision to keep it
all a little bit more on the down-low
like I never was one to like do a lot of
vlogging or share my personal life that
much because I feel like there's such a
fine line between sharing about your
life and it's becoming something way
more than that and it's just not for me
I like my privacy I like having a life
that doesn't have to be documented every
single move so opening up for me on
camera is is hard and that's why my
channel I guess has always sticked to
makeup tutorials or pretty much anything
makeup related like it was very hard for
me to like add in a little bit of a
personal touch in there I'm starting to
get better at it because I feel
confident enough to share with you all
because first is the most amazing
followers out there you guys are so
supportive you lift me up you you don't
let me talk shit about myself like you
are always there to you know lift me up
and show me a more positive and brighter
outlook and I love you for that thank
you so much you know if it wasn't for
you guys I I would be nowhere like this
would not be my life this would not even
be reality it would just be a dream and
stay a dream personal life has been up
and down between Rick and I everything
is amazing I love this man so much like
I can't imagine life without him
like even saying this I'm like what if
we one day I don't hope so but what if
one day we break up and I see the spit
in the mic Nikki you never should have
opened up about that I kept your mouth
shut didn't say a thing they know what
it's part of a journey my family however
if you've been following me for a little
bit on my channel I did share with you
that my little step-brother had cancer
and it's been a long long journey and I
feel so weird to talk about this openly
but like it's been a very long journey
and he has a very special kind of cancer
a type of cancer that is
really hard to treat it's a shitty
texicans any type of cancer is shitty
this is like the point to extra shitty
one and he battled cancer for about a
year and things were amazing he cleared
up he was totally clean after about a
year and half a fighting like a champ he
is so strong and this is where it gets a
little you know emotional for me we
found out that the cancer is back and I
don't want to cry about it we found out
that the cancer is back but he is so
strong and it just it inspires me so
much because he's so chill about it he's
like yeah I got cancer but I beat it
last time so I'm going to do that again
I got this one in the bag I'm strong I
got this and I'm going to show cancer
that I'm the motherfucking boss seeing
how strong he is
and so fearless he like wears his bald
little head with so much pride he's like
I want people to know that I'm fighting
this and it's so ingrained like that
little boy is stronger than any person
I've ever met in my life before blending
this in before it dries up and like I'm
plug and he just started his chemo again
and he's taken it like a champ and they
did two scans already and they saw
improvement so they saw that the tumor
is shrinking again which of course is
incredible news but this is only the
start and we're not there yet
they're going to set my under eyes with
the new 50 powder real quick this sauce
has been amazing
so let's go a little patrick Star order
all and set this safe in this Hamptons
heat and that actually brings me to
another fun opportunity I got contacted
by a new sort of website it's called
stand to basically what it is is a
website where you can buy or win a
personal video message from your
favorite creators so I signed up and
basically what it is is there's an
auction so you can bid on a personalized
like video message by your favorite
creator so let's say if you bid on an
auction with me if you're the winner so
it's kind of like your way if you're a
winner you will get a crystal message
from me in a video and you will get it
sent alive to you and then you can
record your reaction and then I can see
your reaction once you've like watched
it and it's just a very very cool
opportunity and I love that to kind of
connect with all of you but here's what
really did it for me all proceeds go to
charity and for charity I went for kike
and kike in Holland where I live is a
charity for children with cancer I mean
if that doesn't hit home hard enough I
don't know what will so basically if you
win or you donate your money into the
auction all money will go to kike for
children with cancer so ultimately it's
kind of helping my little brother so
I'll definitely leave a little link down
below so you can bid on my auction and I
can send you a precise video message and
I'll put all the infidel below ok on to
brighter things I'm in the Hamptons it's
freaking incredible I don't think I've
ever seen such a beautiful ass and just
pass the room care workers contribute to
be here with Maybelline which is such a
huge brand they were literally like if
you want to spend this week in your bed
you know catching up on sleep that's
totally fine if you want to go to the
beach go to the beach if you want to
film tutorials in the bathroom go do
that and I think it's incredible I think
it's so incredible I'm still
thankful that I'm here and that I get to
take you guys with me okay so the
dreaded part has come I'm going to do my
brows off camera because I cannot for
the life of me do brows on camera this
is under eye baking but I let that sit
until I have my top I should have done
so I'm going to look like a fool for a
little part of this video but that's
fine we're with we're with friends here
don't judge each other so I'm going to
do my brows right now and then I'll be
back
remover as done in eyes primed for eye
shadow and today for I said I'm going to
be using beast by Maybelline I know this
is not sponsored Maybelline does not
hold a gun in this room and telling me
to use this I just want to try it out
because I love trying out new stuff
these are the city mini palettes and so
far I've only tried the rooftop bronzers
one and I also mentioned it in my
previous video and this one is more of a
matte little quad palette here and this
is called matte about town so let me use
this to start some definition in my
crease and I'm not afraid for any fault
oh my god that's images what okay it
doesn't a lot of Fallout but like the
pigment is there so I'm not worried
about the fallout because I got that
entire under-eye bankage going on so
whatever is falling down at the end I
can just look away and I'm going pretty
far out and up got hooded eyes so Mama's
going to swoop it out oh my god this is
so pigmented I love it oh and I dropped
it to survive did you love that sound
now with a clean blending brush I'm
going to move out the edges and usually
with a drugstore shadows once you go in
with a clean blending brush and like
smooth out the edges is when you lose
all pigment like everything will be gone
but this is cleaning out nice I'm
nominated for a Teen Choice Award what I
am nominated for a Teen Choice Award
apparently it's all a fraud apparently
the winners are set in stone like some
moment they announce the nominees
so likes to even be a nominee is crazy
to me I remember when I started my
channel and like these Teen Choice
Awards have been around forever and I
remember the Beauty category always
being Andres toys Michelle Phan bethany
mota well
zoella like all the icons of the beauty
industry on YouTube were nominees and
every year candy Johnson and every year
I'd be like that's never going to be me
just see that I got the nomination right
now is beyond my ringtail like I cannot
comprehend so first of all thank you to
all of you that have voted so far you
can vote online on a special like voting
page but it's for the US and I believe
Canada only but if you are not from the
United States or from Canada I believe
it can both by tweeting my vote for like
Teen Choice Beauty Webster goes to make
it tutorials so I put a little text down
below in the description box you if you
want you you don't have to by any means
and I don't know if it actually does
anything but if you tweet this this will
count as a vote please only do this when
you actually want to vote for me I'm not
pressuring you into anything but you
know maybe you know maybe the winners
are set in stone but maybe we can change
their mind a little bit I think I want
to keep this an all match I look so I'm
going to go in with the lightest shade
right here
and I'm going to set my inner lid with
this and blending into the little
brownie shades now brownie could be
Bobby right now really lighting that up
got it put it to well running in to the
ground oh I like Eileen also if you have
not listened or heard Kesha's new song
praying yet can we take a moment this
phone is so pure and so full of emotion
when I first heard it I was amazed by
fish's voice like I've never heard her
sing like this and just the song builds
up to pure and
other emotions release and the music
video is incredible and the song is
touching and moving but empowering and
you feel inspired and you feel like you
can kick ass but it also tells a story
and it also brings you into a certain
mood a mood of pain but it also brings
you to a mood of overcoming the pain and
and being better than the pain and this
song every time I hear it I get
goosebumps all over every time I see the
music video I cry Kesha round of
applause to you what you have gone
through is so incredibly dark so for you
to pull through like this and become
yourself I applaud you that is so
respectable and if you're ever watching
this I love you I want to invite you
over to get glam with me and let's hang
out and if we could ever get Ke$ha on
this channel my dreams will become
reality so now that the tablet is done
it's time for us or for me to I feel
poor together it's time for me to wipe
away the bake with all the fallout and
focus on the lower lashline so still
working with this map about town palette
and going in with this color right here
and a little bit of this color right
here for the lower lash line you know I
love the smoky lower lash line so on the
lower lash line I'm definitely
experiencing quite a lot of it's all out
but again it's easy to wipe away and
like get rid of it but like I do want to
put it out there good although they're
super pigmented they have fallout
alright let me go ahead and apply some
mascara and falsies I don't usually like
hunch down on like you might think for
that okay that is looking a lot better
I feel like lashes and lower lashes
mascara is really going to pull
everything together for a more basic
smoky eye look like this it's time to
bronze we're in the Hamptons
we got it look like we've been in the
Hamptons heat we gotta look like we've
been baked I'm trying
think of what else we can talk about
today all filming with Kim
kardashian-west oh my god
I literally filmed last week with her in
LA and things are a little crazy I put
it on snapchat can put it on her
snapchat like Benny was back at home in
Holland went crazy like they went like
they went insane they were like Dutch
Nicky does Kim Kardashian's makeup and
is like huge which it is but like
meeting Kim she's so down-to-earth and
she was so much fun to hang out with
that it almost didn't feel like I was
filming with a celebrity I know it
sounds great of course I knew you know I
was touching Kim Kardashian's space but
she was so chill and so fun and down to
earth that it didn't feel like filming
with a fucking icon a lot of people have
been asking me Nicki when is that video
actually coming out and it's going to
take a little bit Kim was so kind to let
me try a brand new product that no one
has seen yet on camera and they want to
wait with the video until they have
announced that product so literally my
hands are tied to my back like I have no
say in that like I can't say anything
about that so I can edit the video and
get it ready but it's up to Kim team to
be like okay Nicki we just announced the
product it's okay for you to go live now
so that's why for the most important
thing about this video the glow flow
around the world I'm going to go in with
them alone I'm sorry but I'm going to
mix it with a little bit of flexitarian
by color pop as well everyone knows that
I love a good blow since the series is
called glow around the world
I better be close I love a good Matt I
look and crazy glowy skin
okay we're reaching our end goal here
