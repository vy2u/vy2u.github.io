today I'll be doing my first prom makeup
tutorial for 2014 and it's a it's an
intense one today I'm going to show you
this problem look it features mainly
sort of this beautiful plummy purple
color with golds and shimmers and lashes
and brows and lips and just elegance and
glamour and y'all I did two prom makeup
tutorials before and you can find the
links down in the infobox and I want to
master it look to involve a little bit
more color so that is why I came up with
the purple and the gold this will suit
all I colors all skin tones it will look
gorgeous on anyone so yeah if you want
to know how to get this prom look then
please keep on watching one of the most
important things to do for prom is prime
if you don't find your skin for an event
like this I can assure you that your
skin will look horrible after an hour or
four already and that is all due to
nerves which gonna make you sweat and um
you're gonna like touch your face a lot
because you're like oh my gosh oh my god
oh my gosh that boy looks hot so the
first thing I'll be doing is taking my
Urban Decay all nighter makeup setting
spray and spray my entire face with this
but first shake it don't use too much of
this that's key I found that when you
use too much of this setting spray it
will counteract won't work make it look
like a greasy grease ball from grease Oh
create lightning and I'm going to go
ahead and take mixed natural radiance
prep and prime in radiant yellow and I'm
just going to take two pumps of that and
OH
just let your skin feel amazing
for my foundation today I'll be using my
favorite L'Oreal True Match and this is
n1 soft ivory but if you're someone like
me and you tend to have a lot of red
spots when you get hot or when you're
dancing or just you had tend to have a
little bit more redness in your face
than others do but I'm going to take my
benefit hello flawless oxygen foundation
and this is a number I'm pure for sure
ivory okay so I'm going to mix it two
together to come up with a little bit
more of a yellow foundation and that
will side
the redness throughout the entire day
and I like to adopt the foundation onto
my skin first and then buff it in with a
brush so go ahead and the brush I love
using for this is the Mac 159 and I just
start buffing this in using circle
circle shape motions I don't know just
you know circle it know a little note I
always take my lips because it gives me
sort of that feeling of a blank canvas
and I can really sort of see my face as
a blank canvas and I can do all kinds of
things to it so I blank up my lips as
well so just go ahead and buff this
entire thing in okay so once you've
completely buff that in it's time for
concealer and I'm going to use my
favourites today under my eyes I'll be
using my Mac Pro Longwear in NC 15 and
then to further highlight my face and
sort of give it a little bit more
dimension I'll be using my NARS radiant
creamy concealer in Chantilly light
number one and I just put it under my
eyes and on the inner corner of my eyes
to really lighten that up as well and
then I sort of drag it down of it and go
here and that will kind of lift this
part I also do the tip of my nose and
then I go ahead and take all the other
concealers and I just go and strive
myself up and once you look like a
complete full you want to tap that in
and I'm gonna use my Real Techniques
miracle complexion sponge something I'm
just going to start tapping all that
concealer work in note as I leave these
very inner corners of my eyes untouched
because I feel like the flat surface of
the sponge it's a little bit too big for
that so for the inner corners of my eyes
I go to the point sort of the
Beautyblender point and then work that
in and then once I find it that all in
I'm going to go back to the flat side
and then work that to the rest of my
face
and then what I like to do is with the
sponge which is damp because I wet it
beforehand I like to go into my setting
powder and for that I like to use my
chanel natural loose finish powder
finish loose powder in 20 Claire and I
really buff it into the sponge and then
set my under eye area with that and this
is a great way of making your under eye
area last all day long for the rest of
my face I'm gonna let that sink in a
little bit more and I'm not gonna set
that yet so what I do after prepping and
foundation and concealer is do my brows
and this is a great trick because this
area here where the foundation is on my
brows is still a little bit damp and wet
and if you apply your brow products on
top of that they really stick to the
skin a little bit more because the
product is still wet I will come up with
an updated Bravo Team soon um so for now
just I'm just gonna do them quickly and
cut half of it out of the video now it's
time to set the entire thing and if a
one thing is important for prom is to
set your face with powder if you're not
powdering your foundation it's gonna
smear it's gonna move so I'm gonna go in
a little bit of my chanel natural loose
finishing powder bla bla and 20 Claire
again and I'm just gonna set my face
with powder lightly and I concentrate
mainly on my t-zone so forehead nose and
chin and then I like to take what is
left and sort of set the entire thing
with that okay now on to eyes one of the
most important things to do with your
eyes is prime them of course just like
skin you want your eyes until last all
night long all day long basically and
what I use to prime my eyelids is my
favorite Mac soft ochre Paint Pot to
start off my look I'm going to take max
a lip liner in currant and I'm going to
use that as an eyeliner so with this I'm
going to start making a line as if I'm
making an eyeliner and then go ahead and
take that to the inner corner
and then go ahead and fill that in what
you don't want to do is drag it into the
crease and really map out your crease
with this and when you know what to do
with that is start blending that liner
that pencil and diffusing all the edges
giving it a soft nice blend
you want to leave that inner part of
that eyeliner that you place you want to
keep that untouched you don't want to
blend that part now I'm going to take
makeup geeks eyeshadow in creme brulee
and I'll be starting to blend that into
the crease above that purpley shade and
this will add a really nice pop of
warmth to the look now I'm going to take
a little bit of makeup geeks peach
smoothie and I will apply that above
creme brulee so we go from the lip liner
to creme brulee to Peach Smoothie I'm
going to intensify that purpley shade on
my lid and crease using
illamasqua is forgiveness I shadow to
just go ahead and intensify that lip
liner color with this okay taking that
lip pencil by Mac again called currant
and lining my bottom lash line with this
and now blending this out with a real
techniques brush and really going down I
told you guys this a million times
before but I really like going down with
my eyeshadows on the bottom lash line
because it really gives it a smoky
effect it really grounds the look a lot
more plus it photos if you go lower with
your eye shadow your eyes will actually
look bigger on pictures now I'm going to
set that using that illamasqua
forgiveness eyes shadow again and just
follow along now with a little bit of
sugar pills bulletproof a nap black I'm
going to intensify the outer corners of
my eyes I'm going on the outer part of
my lower lash line which is really
intensifying and darkening that up and
also
here on the outer part of my eye so sort
of into the crease and on to the lid now
for a pop of shimmer and a pop of bronzy
gold I'm going to take this diamond
effects gemstone collection pigment in
gold stone and I'm going to pop it right
here on that spot that hasn't got
anything on it yet and then blend it
into the darkness a little bit for my
waterline will be using Nyx's slide on
pencil in brown perfection and for the
showstopper of the look I'll be
glittering up my eyes using my makeup
studio dual effects in shine I'm going
to take the tiniest bit and apply there
right here over there bronzy gold color
and this will give your eyes such an
amazing Sparkle and then I'm taking a
tiny bit wet and applying that to the
inner corners okay now it's time for
mascara and lashes and for mascara I'll
be using my makeup studio water proof 3d
in extra black and of course my favorite
lashes the Mac 36 what I highly
recommend is contouring your face for
prom because there's going to be lots of
pictures taken and when one of your
photographers chooses to use a strong
flash it will blow everything away so
I'm going to contour using my Illamasqua
eyeshadow in heroine and just just
contour you also definitely want to warm
up your skin a lot of photographers use
that big flash and what that flash does
is also kind of gets rid of all the
color in your face so I'm going to take
my Illamasqua blush in disobey and
really warm up your complexion and where
I normally would say don't go too far
with your bronzer I think for prom you
can add a little bit more because of
that flash and because of all the
photography of course you don't want to
go too far where you look like an oompa
loompa in real life
but you do want to you know add a little
bit more to make it look good on camera
as in real life for blush it's basically
the same
you want to go a little bit further than
you normally would but you don't want to
go too far where you look like a clown
in real life so I'm going to take my
favorite blush this is the blush ombre
by Mac called Azalea blossom and then
apply that as my blush I would rather go
for a pink blush instead of a peach
because flash photography tends to
really make peach look dead and nude
whereas pink is a little bit more I
don't know a little bit more alive and
there now I'm going to give my face a
beautiful glowy finish and for that I'm
using my Mac extra dimension eyes shadow
in a natural flirt and I'm applying this
to the highest points of my face and
then remember that Urban Decay all
nighter makeup setting spray this is the
time to bust it out again shake it okay
so once you've shook it shaked it took
shake you're gonna take a big stippling
brush and spritz the all nighter spray
onto the brush and then stipple your
face now to finish this entire look off
we need a little bit of lip action and
because the eyes are so intense and
smoky and lava booming sexy I'm going to
go for a subtle lip so I'm first going
to line my lips and give them a little
bit more fullness using my lung comb
LeConte or lip pencil in 211 beige rose
okay for a lipstick I'm then going to
use flash pod by Mac I'm going to go for
the nudist nude I have and then as a
gloss I'm going to add a little bit of
Mac's pink lemonade lip glass
