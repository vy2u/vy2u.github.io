is coming the first thing you want to do
is apply a base chair eyelids to bring
your eyeshadow from creasing throughout
the night or the day and my favorite for
that is next soft ochre Paint Pot I'll
be starting off with corduroy eyeshadow
by Mac what I'm gonna do is blend that
through the outer part of my crease and
then softly start blending it in this is
next kit I shadow and with that I'm sort
of continuing by defining my crease so
corduroy is sort of at the outer part
and kid is going on the inner part
continuing with corduroy I'm going to
blend that at the outer part of my lower
lashes lash lash and then I'm gonna go
up into a straight line and we're sort
of going to do the Rihanna where have
you been shape on the outer crease so
I'm going out and then from the point
I'm going back in to sort of get like
that
whoo and also blend some onto your lid
that will kind of make the whole will
come together in the end
taking kick I shadow again I'm gonna
blend this out and make it softer so
just as with the Rihanna video you're
starting up with a really harsh shape
and you kind of want to blend the edges
to make it less harsh but still a bit
harsh just blend that out I'm gonna take
this beautiful oh crap I'm gonna take
this beautiful makeup studio Lumiere
eyeshadow called ivory gold and that is
going onto brow bone for a really nice
strong gold Sheen now I think that is a
little too much so I'm gonna take next
camomile eyeshadow and
go over that and that will sort of make
it more met applying some milk jumbo
pencil by NYX on my eyelids and then of
course blend it out I'm taking this
beautiful penguin by obsessive
compulsive cosmetics OCC called clove
and that is going over the milk onto the
lid and this is a beautiful color I'm
going back with some corduroy eyeshadow
and blending it with the clove because
right now you have a really sort of
weird blend you want it to be a pretty
blend not weird bubbly I shadow by Mac
but it's just really softly going onto
the outer part of my lower lash line not
you thick I'm gonna take some crystal
Avalanche eyeshadow by Mac that's just
going on the very inner part of my lower
lash line a bit I'm gonna take some
black track fluid line by neck and make
my eyeliner with that and for my
eyeliner I'm going quite thick and
winged
and now you're gonna follow that by
adding glitter to like the inner half of
your black eyeliner the glitter we'll be
using is by OCC again and this is called
slate and as my mixing medium sort of
like a base to make it stick I'm gonna
use illamasqua sealing gel okay I'm
gonna explain it first and then show you
because I don't want to talk about doing
this I'm gonna apply the sealing gel to
the first half of my eyeliner first and
then follow by adding the glitter on top
so sealing gel first glitter on top and
then just make it work sealing gel
glitter on top
and you want to kind of blend that to
like half of the eyeliner I'm not gonna
do the wing and then take some dry
glitter and have that on top to really
make it Sparkle you know a party look
isn't complete with that my makeup
studio jewel effects in shine so that is
just going onto the inner corner slap it
on basically I'm gonna take some of my
favorite mac prolongwear concealer and
clean up under my eyes and with this you
can really make that line underneath
sharp you don't have to use tape you
don't have to use anything weird just
take your concealer and make everything
sure for mascara of course using my
favorite makeup studio extra G black
what approved blah blah blah blah blah
blah one I really love lashes for like
big events I'm not really a person who
wears it everyday but from a big events
go for it the ones I am using are by
miss Maduro and these are number 82 s
now for cheeks of course first I would
shape and contour a bit because it's
photos and I want to look skinny for
that I'm using NYX blush in taupe and
then also a bit around my temples to
give me a more bronzed sculpted look
basically neck for a blushing coming in
a little bit brighter than I normally
would because normally with photography
it's mostly flash and especially with
your prom flash oh really blows away a
lot of color and for that I'm kind of
bringing on some more color to my cheeks
to really kind of balance it out the
blush I'm using is love cloud by Mac
then of course I'm gonna highlight my
face because we all want to look glowy
and fresh I'm gonna use something new
for me this is soft and gentle I mean I
realized skin finish by Mac I wanted to
try this one out because it's new for me
and I'm just gonna blend that unlike the
highest points my cheekbones bridge of
my nose don't make yourself too shiny
because then you will look like a
greaseball I'm prom and you
want that and for my lips I wanted to
keep everything a little bit more nude
but still defined because this is a lot
for prom now to make your lips last
longer on prom we're going to use
pencils because pencils you kind of draw
everything in and it really stays put
I'm first gonna line my lips to make
them look more fuller with Mac's boldly
bare lip pencil then on the middle of my
lips I'm gonna make them more
highlighted this is naked liner by Mac
then going over with naked lip liner and
going for fleshpot lipstick by Mac and
going over and I think what I'm using is
Turkish Delight by NARS and that
completes my first picture perfect for
prom makeup tutorial I'm definitely
gonna do another tutorial for problem
but that is more alike on the softer
side and maybe it was like a bright lip
or a full list of every single product
