second look form a picture perfect for
prom series and the last one was a
little bit more extreme and smokey and
today I'm going to do a look for the lip
lovers out there because I got a lot of
requests on Twitter and on the video
itself like hey I love this but I want
lips on prom without any further ado if
you want to know how to get this prom
look then please keep on watching
okay guys so especially on prom the
first thing you want to do is to apply a
base year I'll it's to prevent us all
from creasing and of course I am going
to use my neck soft ochre Paint Pot okay
so the first thing I will be using is
this wet and wild eye pellet and this is
called a vanity let me feel like Natalia
killed
Fanny and then I don't know what she
says and the color will be starting up
with is this amazing brown which
actually looks a really similar to cork
and I'm just gonna start but bringing
some definition into my crease
most of the photography is going to be
flash and flash really blows out colors
and shadows and anything dark which is
nice but when it comes to your makeup
that kind of blows that out too so we're
gonna go a little bit darker so what I
did right here is kind of in my mind I
took this out and then start it by
making a line here in my crease then
going back in and then I blend that out
really softly now I'm going to take a
bit of that really nice dark brown matte
color and this is going on to the outer
part of my crease blend it towards the
middle I'm gonna blend this out of it
with my favorite blending brush I'm
gonna take the lightest matte color of
the palette and highlight my brow bone
with that
for my eyelid I'm mixing this shimmery
color and this matte color together and
that is just going onto my lid and blend
it all the way out so all the way to
this outer corner as well now I'm gonna
take that light shimmery color only and
highlight my very inner tear duct area
what's that now taking mixed copper
plate I shadow and I'm gonna blend
copper plate right along my lower lash
line and I'm going all the way in with
that and I'm just looking that very in a
corner bare the showstopper of this look
is the double winged line so I'm gonna
take a brush I'm just filling the rest
of my lid up and then once I reach like
the outer corner of my eye I'm gonna
wing copper plate out and I'm gonna take
this gel eyeliner by Inglot and this is
number 89 I'm just gonna take my wing to
that upper wing we made before and we're
just gonna keep this eyeliner really
delicate and really really tiny and
small we don't want to make it too
dramatic because our last look was
dramatic as well so we kind of want to
control ourselves this time just
remember to go really delicately really
small with your eyeliner
now these thing while eyeliners are
really really what improve so they are
perfect for prom because even if you're
going to cry or I don't know you're
going to do it prom mm-hmm because of
that it needs a little bit longer to dry
so I'm gonna give this the time to dry
and don't look up because if you look up
it will get in your crease and once it's
in your crease you will not get it off
I'm gonna take this a litte litter lik
litter in Marilyn Monroe and I'm gonna
take they're clearly liquid glitter base
as a mixing medium to make my glitter
stick and all I'm going to do is place
the mixing medium between those two
wings first and then with your brush go
into the Marilyn Monroe glitter by lids
and go on top
and then what works really nice for
pictures is highlights on these very
inner corners of your eye it will really
like make your eyes go like I'm gonna
apply them of the Marilyn Monroe glitter
to my very inner tear duct area as well
remember I'm going to use this Ben Nye
neutralized a cream crayon now to finish
up my eyes all I'm going to do is apply
some mascara and false lashes the
mascara we'll be using is by makeup
studio and this is the waterproof 3d
extra black and for my bottom lashes I'm
going to use another makeup studio one
and this is called the false lash effect
in 4d from a false lashes I'm using the
exact same as the last video these are
the mists into room number 82 you and I
love how long and and just how barb you
like they are so I'm going to apply all
that and then I will be back
okay for me cheese on fritz gonna sculpt
and contour because I'm skinny and I'm
using NYX blush in taupe for that
for blush I'm using the Tarte Amazonian
clay 12-hour blush in over X but no not
over it's just exposed it's not
overexposed I'm just gonna apply that to
the apples of my cheeks and going back
into my contour I'm gonna take this
whisper of guilt extra dimension skin
finished by Mac and I'm just gonna
highlight the cheekbones
okay now fur lips you can do whatever
you want you can go really bright really
dark really subtle so I came up with
some options that you can choose from if
you like really want to go into this
look if you want to make this classic
and really like a Hollywood style kind
of look go for a really nice matte red
color this is box by Illamasqua perfect
red net color if you want to go for a
slightly darker more elegant touch
I would suggest a rebel this is a really
really nice dark sort of berry purple
car I will swatch it for you it is
gorgeous
so that is rebel and this watch right
here is box by Illamasqua now if you
want to go really bright I suggest going
for a really nice sort of peachy orange
color so I suggest starting your lip off
with entertainment pencil by Mac and
that is a sweatshirt right here that is
the feel of orange but if you don't like
orange and you want it to be like a
bright bright peach
grab your Nicki Minaj Viva Glam lipstick
and put that on top and you will get an
amazing like sort of neon coral pink
color and that is what that looks like
and for another bright option this is
sleek's candy-cane lipstick that is also
gorgeous that it's a little bit brighter
a little bit more red than this
combination right here of course you
could go nude or just a gloss but for me
because I really love this I'm gonna go
with that option right there
and this is a little combined with the
Entertainer lip pencil and the Nicki
Minaj lipstick so yeah I really love
this so yeah guys that completes this
picture perfect for problem look number
