going through it's like ever since I
started we our agency the hair course
five weeks ago all I've been thinking
about his hair like I see people walking
down the streets and all if you think
about it's like curling them and just
brushing the hair and teasing the hair
and that combing it's a hair everywhere
for me right now so today I am here to
share with you my Primark haul um and
actually my first Primark experience
because yesterday I went to Primark
Essen in Germany and it was actually my
first Primark experience ever
like it was my first time going to a
Primark ever I don't know I'm clapping
it was so much fun and I bought know way
too much so today I wanted to share all
with you that I bought and my
experiences and what I think about the
clothing and everything so um let's go
did the first thing I want to show you
is this top I'm wearing right now this
is the first thing I'm showing you from
Primark this is a top that I believe was
from the winter collection I was like
that's a little bit cold for the wind
turbine I love it this is a white sort
of lace of sort of mesh if you look like
pearl beads and just shimmery beets and
it's like shimmery when you move and
it's amazing this stuff was only 15
euros and then also this necklace which
I've been searching for for so long they
had it at H&amp;amp;M I know but then when I
wanted to get it it was sold out on
stock and then I saw this yesterday I
was like finally you're in my life this
was six euros six a necklace sixth euros
so just you bite the head of mouth how
do you call head fact it spits off by
the the rush hour off I don't know
so these are the two first Primark
things I got yesterday and I love it
okay so let's go get their brown bag
that just died on me
crap this is not exactly how I wanted
this to go this is a blazer not Wow
okay wait before I continue I am six for
two and why does a bear I sometimes look
like a bear I'm really tall I'm really
wide I'm like I'm like a giant I'm
perfectly okay with being a giant the
problem is I like to wear Blazers
I love jackets I love blazer so in
Holland we are known for being tall and
and wide and big and why for some god
reason we do not have wide jackets like
jackets made for wider people like
bigger people so jackets and blazers in
Holland net no fit for me so in sta
yesterday at Primark I saw this blazer
and I was like well that's not going to
fit me because Germany Holland there's
not really so many differences so I saw
this amazing blazer at Primark and the
sizes go up to 20 which is a 46 I
believe normally we have 46 in Holland
and they're still too narrow I took this
blazer and I just put it on and it fit
perfectly plus I had some space to
actually do this to actually move around
and actually do stuff I almost started
crying in that store I was so happy and
I was like oh my god thank you for
making me fit fit I got this blazer it's
a black matte blazer with leather look
arms so when I noticed that that blazer
fit me I was like I gotta try all the
Blazer so I found this jacket which is
so pretty
um it's sort of like a green and grey
sort of um
oh I never do fashion hauls I'm so bad
with fabric it's from like a sheep and
then it's dyed and then it's fake
because this is not real so this is this
really soft material in green and grey
and dark grey and then again with a
leather look sleeves and this is just so
fun I love this so much and look at that
I think this is
for outside info and I just ah I love
this and I love the colors and I love
the leather another blazer this is
another really classic blazer just in
matte black but it has these awesome
gold zippers at like your waistline and
it's so it's so basic and casual and
great for like parties or for like for
like edging up a look for if you like if
you're cold or something it's so nice
and again it fits me perfectly and I'm
so happy in all their Blazers I bought
are in size 20 and for this green one
it's actually a size 16 which didn't
understand at all but it's a 16 then I
got this amazing sort of eggplant slash
arms blood dress with again a leather
this is quite tight on your body I I got
this in a size 18 because I was like
well this is so you mungus and so wide
and so flowy it's actually quite tight
around the body so what I like to do is
pull it up a bit and make it a bit
shorter and then sort of ruffle the the
stomach area because if you're not in
the mood to suck it all in then you can
let it breathe I got these two belts and
I absolutely love them and again
normally belts I have to get from the
ASIS curve a section but these are
actually in the main collection of the
Primark collection and I love to use
belts like this for like if you have a
really plain dress or if you have to
like pull some attention to the
waistline and just you're I love this I
got some underwear which I'm not showing
you because that is for me and my
boyfriend only so as I told you before I
got this necklace for six euros but also
for six years I got this amazing
statement piece necklace I know there's
fingerprint spots and everything on it
so this is gonna be a hard one to keep
clean but just the statement you can
make with this then also I found another
type of jacket thing this is a leather
body warmer and it's hot it has a zipper
and then right here you have this really
cool detail where you can like make it
tighter I've been wearing this non-stop
ever since we got back here
to date except for this video I love
this is do you call this a body warmer
in American and England as well I don't
know we call it a body warmer here I got
a new purse for only 22 euros and again
leather black with this gold detail on
the side I've been having my person ever
now for like two three years now so it
was time for something new and when I
saw this I was like that has me written
all over it it's just a really basic big
bag with gold detailing on the side and
I like my bags big because I have so
much stuff to carry around with me I
call it my hood scoffer and then last
but not least from Primark and you're
gonna your pants I got a onesie
I've always wanted to one see in my life
never got one never found one and then
there was this whole department with
onesies at Primark I saw like a sheep a
tiger a bear a cow
strawberry they have like all these type
of onesies but then I found half of it
so much I found this Dracula onesie
including okay oh my god I love it
um so it has the collar like Dracula has
as well and then it has a cape that you
can just fly off with with it it has
feet so uh you're actually all tied in
with feet and everything and Dracula's
nose kind of looks like a penis so that
is it for my first and ever Primark haul
