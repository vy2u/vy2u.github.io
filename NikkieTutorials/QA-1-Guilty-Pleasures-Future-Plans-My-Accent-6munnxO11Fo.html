here at nikkietutorials
I'm gonna start doing Q&amp;amp;A video so
questions and answers videos and I've
seen basically every youtuber do this
and I personally love to watch these
videos because you really get to know
the youtuber who's doing video and plus
I just really like answering questions
for you guys and sort of like what do
you want to know from me so starting
today I want to do a reoccurring thing
of Q&amp;amp;A videos here on my my channel and
on my website nikkietutorials comm so
what I did was on Twitter at
nikkietutorials I tweet it like yo I
never say yo I'm gonna do my first Q&amp;amp;A
video on do you have any burning
questions or what I did was if you have
a question for me then you have to tweet
it with hashtag ask Nicki in it quite a
lot if you actually had some questions
for me so what I'm gonna do is look on
my phone look on my phone go to the
hashtag ask Nicki and then go through
the questions and if I see one that I
really like then I'm gonna answer that
and if I think it's crap and I'm not so
also for future Q&amp;amp;A videos if you have a
burning question for me then just tweet
it at me with hashtag ask Nicki and then
I will see it on my Twitter if you
tagged me or I will just go to the
hashtag and then I see the question as
well if you don't have enough space for
140 characters letters you get it if you
want the question to be seen you have to
go to ask Nicki hashtag ask Nicki on
Twitter so yeah okay so before we start
I'm gonna answer two common questions
that I get on a daily basis 3:3 number
one what is your accent and where are
you from I'm from the Netherlands
Holland I live in Holland I'm Dutch I'm
from Holland the Netherlands and that's
it so I'm Dutch
let's get that out of the way number two
how old are you I am 19 years old 19
years old and I started YouTube when I
was 14 I brush number three are you
related to Jennifer Lawrence I wish I
was but I'm not so we got that cleared
out so here are the questions from
hashtag s Mickey what is your guilty
pleasure my guilty pleasure god
I don't really I probably spongebob
squarepants I love that sponge to death
I just I went oh oh I love that show so
much and Squidward is so cute he's so
grumpy I love their grumpy old but I
love him like when smart what was on TV
I just I i'm send out i like you can't
reach me i'm i'm done i'm spongebob all
the way who is your ultimate youtube
crush haha i love you
oh good one don't have one don't have
one I'm sorry how do you see yourself in
five years
in five years I hope I've worked with
vogue at least one time I hope more but
I hope at least ones I want to travel
the world I want to have this amazing
life where I combine my personal life
with work and work is just it doesn't
feel like work because it's doing makeup
and hair all over the world and doing
big shows like the big Fashion Week's
like New York and Paris and Milan and
Amsterdam and all that kind of places I
I want to go in five years I want to see
myself going places for work for big
shows and bhikshu it's them for like
covers and magazines and and assisting
like huge artists and and I want to have
a great personal life as well what's
your favorite food my favorite food is
by my mom and she makes up we call it no
see here in a vanilla and Holland and
it's sort of like rice with um satay
sauce I don't know what that is in
English um and it's not like the typical
nutsy that you get from like the Chinese
take off no we actually make it
ourselves and then we put like like good
stuff in it another good stuff in it and
it's so good and it's like it's chicken
and in so good like whenever my mom
makes that I just I want to eat all the
plates if you could only have either the
Mac soft ochre Paint Pot or NYX blush in
taupe which would you choose
I can't you cannot ask me that there's
like choosing one of your two children
I'd
soft ochre Paint Pot I think okay the
next question is if you can put yourself
in a movie or a TV show which movie or
TV show would it be like if it was like
the legit real world and I could put
myself in it I would totally say The
Walking Dead but I am playing The
Walking Dead game right now and so far I
have died 13 times and I am a level 2
right now I have died 13 times in two
levels that means that if the zombie
apocalypse were to be real I will be
dead as fudge I would have make it 10
seconds into that world of course
somewhere in the back of my mind I'm
like yeah I'm gonna be this tough Jake
who kills all the zombies just like
Andrea or just let me shown and I'm
gonna kill all the zombies I'm gonna
kill all the people that hate me and
this and I'm totally moving like Jay
from geordie shore right now I'm sorry
anybody is banging of course everyone
then the backs of their minds think like
well I'm gonna make it through the
entire apocalypse I'm not it's kinda
tempting to say Game of Thrones and then
be like family of Danny Daenerys
Targaryen that would be awesome
maybe I could be one of her dragons
maybe Jesus Christ
why does every show have one like fudged
up twist to it like I was gonna say to
following but then it would be a
murderer so uh I know what the Real
Housewives of Beverly Hills
I would so be Lisa as best friend I
would so be that yeah if you could have
superpowers what would it be and why if
I could have superpowers it would be
getting ready in five minutes and
looking like super glam that would be
one of them next question who is your
favorite superhero Batman what camera do
you film with I film with a canon 600
when we check a set as a canon 600d and
the lens where i'm looking at right now
is the 24 to 105 millimetres 1.4 l lens
by canon there you go what do you think
of one direction I
in Ghana boy bands are never gonna be my
thing never gonna be my stick boy bands
just annoyed the utter crap out of me
what one direction is the first boy man
who I actually liked a song of they're
cute they're cute but some whatever
search eagle tastic speaker do you want
to do your own makeup for your wedding
hell yeah
and the last question for this Q&amp;amp;A video
my very first one is where did you learn
to speak English this well now of course
my accent is always there I cannot get
rid of it maybe if I live in the States
forever from now on but no and I just
watched a lot of TV shows English TV
shows as a child plus I kind of well if
you do videos every week here on YouTube
in English you kind of get used to it to
talk American English plus I kind of
teach myself like really listen to other
people and how they pronounce things and
of course now and then I still like
fucked up but I'm kind of okay with that
it's kind of funny to me and of course
my accent is always going to be there I
always kind of compare myself to Yolanda
from the Real Housewives of Beverly
Hills because when I hear a talk I'm
like that's home so just watch a lot of
TV shows in English and I also read a
lot of English books to kind of get used
to grammar and everything one tip I want
to give you though when talking American
English really sort of like really talk
yeah cynically submit concludes my first
Q&amp;amp;A video here on you go to toriel's I
said that a million times but thank you

have any questions tweet them to hashtag
ask Nikki and I will see it on my
