so today I thought it would be fun to do
a Q&amp;amp;A video for you I haven't done a Q&amp;amp;A
video in the longest time I went to
Twitter Instagram and Facebook to ask
you to ask me all your questions and I'm
just going to select a couple random few
questions that I like and I'm gonna
answer them so the first one I'm gonna
go to is Facebook from amenda Martell Oh
Game of Thrones looking back do you have
any looks that you were that you now
would consider and oh god no actually I
have quite a few and looking back I'm
like what the freaking hell was I
thinking how did my brain say you rocked
this more importantly why did the
comments say you rock this next question
is Mike Eileen does YouTube ever
interfere with your personal life like
hanging out with friends and family
because being a makeup artist is busy
work and then YouTube on top throughout
the years it has been tough to kind of
do it all together at once to be a
makeup artist to be in the field to do
makeup and hair for photo shoots and
shows and TV stuff and then also be
youtuber and then also having your
family and friends to you know pay
attention to so definitely at first it
was hard for me to combine it all but
you should know that makeup artists
travel a lot and traveling is call time
for me so whenever I'm driving to the
location of the photo shoot I just call
one of my friends and catch up and have
fun talking on the phone I tried to see
my friends most in the weekends or late
in nights because during the day I'm
either filming or on a photo shoot so I
meet my friends and family at nights I
see my mom throughout the day because I
film at home and my mom has her own
beauty salon here so um I try to keep it
up it's hard I kind of neglect people
now in them but I try to you know call
them as much as I can and be in contact
as much as I can but it is it is hard
Billy asks if you could only use one
makeup brand for the rest of your life
what one would it be
probably Mac because Mac has all the
products that you need it has everything
that works is it the most exciting brand
not at all because how can I live
without my brow waves by Anasazi Beverly
Hills how can I live without my Becca
shimmering skin Perfector in moonstone
how can I live without illamasqua heroin
how can I live without
luminoso but if I had to make one
decision a brand that carries all the
products that I would need is Mac it's
not the most exciting brand but it works
she asks tacos or burritos tacos
Betty asks what has been your most
fulfilling experience as a makeup
artists and/or beauty youtuber my most
fulfilling experience has been Mexico I
got flown out to Mexico to do hair
makeup for this huge campaign for swim
KO and so far that's the highlight of my
entire makeup artist career the team the
location the people the the vibe
everything was perfect now if you would
ask me what was the most fulfilling
video as a youtuber to ever do the
creepy clown for last Halloween I went
all out with that video and I had so
much fun with that video that the
lighting and the wig and the contacts in
the blood and the editing I have so much
fun with the editing a Mila asks would
you rather be an astronaut or date a
royalty from Holland I would rather be
an astronaut really because the royalty
in Holland aren't really all that nice
any asks do you wear makeup every day
absolutely freaking not I could not
imagine absolutely not
I used to wear makeup on a daily basis
religiously it's just all I could think
of just wearing makeup getting that
makeup on but you know ever since a
couple of years ago I've been kind of
just wearing makeup for the videos only
and when I have like an event to go to
but like on a daily basis where I have
nowhere to go nothing to do a bare face
honey so those were the Facebook
questions I'm not going to go over to
Twitter and answer a few
affair here's a question by he miyamura
hopefully if you could change your hair
length color texture anything would you
and what would you change it to first of
all I would like freakin get long hair
my hair just doesn't grow it's just this
length is I guess this length is me
forever cuz it just it doesn't grow I
hated so much I love long hair it's oh I
live for long hair and I just I just
can't get it the only options I have to
get long hair is a wig and extensions
and y'all seem to hate that on me so so
Haila
asks if you're not a makeup art is what
will you be doing like what are your
other passions
I've always loved web designing so
creating websites and doing the layout
for that and Photoshop I love pho I love
playing with Photoshop I love creating
things with Photoshop
actually before I did makeup videos I
used to create vectors and vectors are
like um you recreate a photograph with
Photoshop with all these little shapes
it's the most redundant thing to ever do
it takes the longest time to just make a
like graphic picture look like a real
picture and it's all I did before I did
videos it's I loved Photoshop I loved
creating websites so if I didn't roll
into makeup and all that I'd probably be
like a web designer website creator or
Photoshop or retouch or something
something with a laptop Jess asks you
have to give up your contour shadow in
heroine or your Becca highlighter in
moonstone which one and why don't do
this do we okay I would probably let go
of the Becca shimmering skin Perfector
in moonstone because there are
substitutes for that and I feel that LMS
cos heroin is so unique and so such a
star of its own that it's the only star
that stars in that department I just
feel like Becca's moonstone can be
duplicated for something else and I feel
like heroin by Illamasqua can't so I'm
gonna go for Illamasqua heroin that will
stay and moonstone should go never okay
never okay last question from Twitter is
by Kayla and she asks easy tips for the
girls starting to contour I swear I've
been looking like a hot mess attempting
this lol I'm doing a full how to contour
in highlight video next week
pinky swear promise I've been getting so
many requests for this it's finally time
for me to do a video on contouring and
highlighting only so I'm gonna help you
out just you which okay for the last
questions I'm going to head over to my
Instagram the X sepia asks if you didn't
live in the Netherlands which country
would you like to live in America
America Deluxe ray asks have you ever
experienced any life-changing moments I
have one really big one I used to work
as I work at a supermarket and I worked
till I worked my shift till 6:00 at
night and then I went home on my bike
and people were telling that a storm was
coming and I was like terrifying
whatever but the Sun was that and it was
super hot outside when I went on my bike
and drove home and everything was fine
and I was like halfway through and then
this huge thunder started happening
above me it's not raining really hard
and in just like five seconds the sky
went from super happy and sunny and
everything to like hell and I was like
oh that's not great because I'm outside
on my bike and hell is breaking loose
right now
so I have like five more minutes to go
till I was home and then I'm almost home
and you should know that wind was
dragging me across the street it was
raining so hard it was it was SuperDuper
scary and then I was almost home the
wind blows me to the other side of the
road so it literally the wind literally
he picked me up and pushed me to the
other side of the road and that startled
me and then another wind situation
happened and I fell to the ground and
you guys like five meters in front of me
this huge tree falls down in front of me
I started crying I had this huge panic
attack people came out of their houses
to help me because they saw it happening
it's literally if that wind had thrown
me out
five meters more in front of me I would
be underneath that tree probably dead
I'm gonna do two more and then I'm gonna
call it a day as Neen asks are you more
of a day or a night person I am but ask
anyone around me I am by far a night
person do not wake me up in the morning
because you will have problems with me I
come alive at night I can be this The
Walking Dead zombie from 10:00 till like
3:00 in the in the afternoon and then
after that I'm like hello I'm starting
to wake up here follow keV jeans asks
besides makeup family and friends what
brings you the most joy in your life
seeing good blended eyeshadow and fierce
eyebrows does does my dog max I'm so
cliche alright guys so that's it that
