Halloween tutorial of 2015 this is a
look I came up with actually I had no
sleep tonight I did an all-nighter and
around the clock of 6:00 in the morning
this came to me I felt like I wanted to
be queen of the Dead so it's just this
really creepy character but still
glamorous with her crown all her jewels
her hair laid just queen of the Dead I
had so much fun making this look for you
I hope you enjoyed if you want to know
how to get this look right here then
please keep on watching alright guys so
let's get on to it the first thing we
want to do is completely make our face
look dead so you want to go for the
lightest shade of foundation possible
and maybe even add a little bit of white
to it I'm gonna go for the Maybelline
fit me matte poreless foundation in
number 110 and mixing it with white just
a little bit
now remember you want to be dead and now
with a Beautyblender really start
working that in
then also go ahead and apply this to the
neck area and your decolletage now
quickly set it with a powder and then we
can start working on sculpting our dead
face just start sculpting the face I'll
be using this makeup geek eyeshadow
right here and this is called a bedrock
and with this you really want to hollow
out your face I'm going to come in a
little bit higher up come down onto my
cheek and then from there start curving
it in along your mouth and then just
start blending like a crazy person
then also start coming in from your
temples and especially this curve right
here will create a lot of effect for you
we're going to leave the face to rest
for a little bit now and focus on the
eyes I'm going to deepen my eyes using
this color by makeup geek as well this
is called cherry cola and this is going
inside your crease and focusing most of
it on the inside portion right here
blending up towards your brow bone and
see how that creates a lots of depth and
death
then follow through the rest of your
crease and keep it very Brown shaped now
I'm going to apply some makeup geek
americano to my lower lash line and
really smoke it up
here I'm applying a makeup geek
duochrome eyeshadow and blending the
edges sloppily the duochrome is called
mai tai and also applying this color to
the inner corners and I like this
because it kind of feels like this girl
the queen of the Dead was not ready to
give up on her glam on her everyday
shiny pink duochrome color on the inner
corners oh I love how this duochrome
color this one is called black light and
I love how it just gives that soft
Bruzzi feel not going to really darken
everything using black I'm also going to
add in some of the cherry color to the
contour now
I'm now quickly gonna fake bleach my
brows using my Kyle on this is a water
activated aqua color in a really light
blonde color and just believed in brows
now it's time to focus on the mouth area
there are teeth showing but in a really
different way than other normal
Halloween teeth a first adding in some
black to add definition
and now it's time to draw on the teeth
and once you've applied your tooth you
want to whisk and blend it out upwards
and adding depth using cherry cola
now going to go ahead and apply some
more depth using a black eye shadow
after this go ahead and pop your
contacts in drop your wig on your head
put your outside on do some fine
detailing and you're done and that guys
