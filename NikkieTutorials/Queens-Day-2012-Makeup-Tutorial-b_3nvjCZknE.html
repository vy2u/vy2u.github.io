tutorial for our Dutch Queens day and
Queens it last year I sort of did an
intro like this and it didn't really
explain what Queens day is Queens day
it's like the birthday of our Queen and
it gets like celebrated all over the
streets and people get drunk and crazy
and they got all orange red white or
blue I am gonna show you how to get this
really cool orange smoked out eyes plus
I'm wearing nude lips now but I'm also
gonna share on how you can wear it with
neon lips because I know that a lot of
girls and guys like to go all out in
Queens day and wear orange everywhere
even in their panties so yeah today I am
gonna show you how to get this Queens
day inspired look if you want to know
how to do this and please keep on
watching
so as always the first thing you want to
do is apply a base to your eyelids to
prevent the eyeshadow from creasing and
the one I'm using is my Mac soft ochre
Paint Pot the first color going to use
is mext cork eyeshadow and I'm going to
start out by putting that on my lower
lash line and going like halfway in and
then going into the crease as well I'm
gonna take this illamasqua medium eye
pencil in trash which is almost in the
young orange and that is going onto the
remaining part of the crease and just
kind of sketch out your crease on the
inner half now I'm going to take this V
art eyeshadow pail that I got fxh and
Amsterdam and the colors are going to
use are that one that one and that one
I'm just going to make a mixture between
them until I get the color that I like
and basically all I gonna do is blend
out the crease and yes you can go over
that orange eyeliner that is sort of
like a reminder of where we want the
orange to be later on so go ahead and
blend everything out I'm gonna use sugar
pills flame point I shadow now that is
just going on that part where we placed
the Illamasqua pencil and of course
blending out you don't want it to be too
harsh
from that fee start pull it again I'm
gonna use that one with that one and
we're gonna warm up the rest of the
crease with this the more Brown each
side we're gonna warm that up with it
and just remind that you all want to
keep it really really blended I'm
popping some NYX milk jumbo pencil on my
lid and then of course blend it out I'm
gonna take this beautiful golden shiny
eyeshadow back
Lana this is shine number seven that is
going on to the lid this is a beautiful
color
oh my god do you ever feel like gold
eyeshadow is that pretty yes on your
eyelid I'm gonna go back with these two
colors again and kind of blend those
with the gold on the eyelid okay I'm
taking and YX jumbo pencil in milk again
that is going on to my inner corner now
I'm gonna take the outrageous gorgeous
sleek acid pellet and of course I'm
gonna take the orange
duh no Sherlock and that is going
on top of the NYX milk base and that
will really make it pop and I love this
orange neon on the inner corner so
pretty no make the rest of the bottom
lid a little bit more warm with my face
art pellet I'm gonna take mixed
chamomile and nylon eyeshadow and those
two are going onto the inner corners
right here these are makeup CEOs jewel
effects in shine this is a must-have in
everyone's collection and my mom sells
it in her web shop his close mates guys
dot and now what I'm going to do the
gorgeous glitter ish is gonna put that
on the inner corner as well I mean look
how pretty that is just gorgeous for my
waterline I'm using my favorite Ben Nye
neutralizer cray cray and cream crayon
okay I'm quickly gonna apply a winged
eyeliner nothing harsh nothing
complicated so if you really want to
know how to do this because I'm gonna go
really fast through this I have several
videos on eyeliner Lana Del Rey video
Kesha video but I'm going to use my Mac
black track fluid line and just a really
nice simple clean winged eyeliner
all I'm going to do now is apply some
mascara as a base for my false lashes
and a one I'm using is makeup Studios
waterproof 3d extra black this is my
favorite all-time mascara and then for
lashes I'm gonna use these miss adore um
number 42 because I really really love
how wispy and long they are so I'm gonna
apply those as well for a contour
because I always want to look contoured
and nice I am gonna use Mac's
blush in sculpt and I'm gonna mix that
with NYX or Nexus taupe blush and I
always like to go back with the fluffier
brush and blend it out even more for
blush it's really important not to go to
brown or orange because everything is
orange right now my eyes are orange and
gold my lips are going to be orange or
warm nude color so when you make
everything really orange and brown toned
you're gonna look sick and old and done
with it so you want to sort of like
freshen up your face with a little bit
of a brighter blush this is max love
cloud and then of course as a highlight
I'm going to use my face front flash
light highlight powder in double
exposure and apply that on my
highlighting points
now for our lips I have like two options
one is a really nice warm nude so sort
of like on the orange side of nudes or
of course it's Queen's Day and go all
out and apply a orange lipstick
so that is sort of the wearable option
number ones are just a really nice new
color with a sort of hint of orange
peach in it or if you're totally going
up for Queen's Day you can apply orange
lips as well now little side note this
will make it crazy as hell like bright
eyes bright lip shade this is OCC's only
tart and banjee so I'm just gonna apply
there really quickly off-camera and then
it will be back this is the look with
orange lips included I feel a little bit
like a clown now but I know that people
love this on Queens day so yeah

Day inspired makeup look for my duchies
