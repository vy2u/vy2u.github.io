on Queens day and Queens day here in
Dunellen
is a next Saturday the 30th of April we
go nuts
we go all the way out we dress up like
idiots
a big trend in fashion lately is orange
and especially orange lips so um it is
really shocking to most of you and to me
as well to have orange lips on camera
today yeah have fun people drink lots of
alcohol because we can do it here in the
Netherlands so the first thing you want
to do is apply a stirlitz to prepare
your eyes from creasing and the base I'm
using is the beach on the prom
so the Pelham we're using today is the
number 3 BH pellet and I'm taking the
like the top layer of the palette and a
color I'm going to use first is that one
right here so that one and mix it just a
teeny tiny bit with that one and with
the brush like this I'm just gonna trace
my crease by just first going under my
lower lashes just make a stripe then
follow the way out of your waterline go
out like that take a little bit more and
from that outer point go all the way
into your crease and go as far in as you
like this is just a little disclaimer I
want to go far in to make my nose look
smaller and I know a whole lot of you
told me in my last video like you always
do that yes I always do that because
that is what suits my eye shape you
don't have to do it so just from the
outer point go into your crease and just
kind of push it in like that just take a
little bit more and then go all right
in a corner if you like as I said I like
to do it you don't have to now I'm going
to connect it to the lid in here and
make it a little bit round right there
fill it in blend it up now I'm going to
take the two colors underneath the
lightest shade of the pallet and then
take a brush like that and blend it up
so just like you get a like orange
crease and then blend it up with this
unlike mid-tone orange and yellow and
beige enos so just blend that above it
you kind of want to see this as like a
cut crease that's how you can call it
this is kind of cut orange crease now
you can go back with that small brush
and go into the first two colors use and
make it a little bit darker in the
crease if you like or a little bit more
Orange
we're get lower lashline I'm going to
take this color right here that one and
just kind of darken that outer corner of
your eyes of your lower lid now for the
brow one highlight I'm going to take a
lightest color of the upper layer of the
pallet and then just put that on the
brow bone and I'm also going to put that
on to the lid for the pop of gold
glitter on the lower lid I'm going to
take this la splash liquid eyeliner base
for glitter and the glitter I'm using is
from eye candy and it's called candy
coin so it's really easy with this la
splash when you just take that brush and
you put the base on where you want the
glitter to me
and then just dab it into the glitter
and put it on and I swear on my mother
socks that this will stay on the entire
day I mean I've worn both of the like
basis for a glitters
and they stay put like the entire day
now I'm just gonna use a dark brown
pencil for my waterline and I'm gonna
use some mascara okay so for the lift
I'm gonna do them orange and orange is
really hot in fashion lately orange
clothes orange makeup like everything
orange it's fashion lately um so I'm
going to give you some options um you
can choose between the MEK lipstick in
morons
or a moron or more on J or you can use
the OCC lip tar in safety orange I'm
going to use the MEK lipstick in moron
Jorm Orange now I'm going to take some
of that OCC lip tar and safety orange
and I'm actually gonna just Pat that in
the middle just for some fun and that's
it um I know this is kind of shocking
like the orange lips and it's not
helping that it's neon on camera but
here here in the nail ins when it's a
Queen's Day everyone goes out of their
freaking brain they go insane they drink
so much alcohol and they like to go
orange or red or right or blue or okay
