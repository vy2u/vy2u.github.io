to kind of get this image on your brains
I'm wearing a beanie for the first time
in my life I feel so hipster I feel like
clothes and counters on YouTube right
now so today I have a really fun quick
tip for you guys this is how to make
your lips look fuller in a natural way
and this is particularly when you're
wearing lipstick that is because I can't
sort of show you magic tricks to make
your lips look like big and sort of
Victoria from revenge like I can do that
I can however show you how to make your
lips look bigger with lipstick without
it looking like super duper fake this is
sort of like a foolproof way of going
bigger but not going overboard and sort
of like really naturally plumping up
your lips with lipstick okay so let's
just go right ahead to the part where I
show you how this all works take a
shimmery product this is my Mac soft and
gentle mineralized skinfinish and just
sort of go over your lips and sort of
above them as well everyone on this
planet has pigmentation in their lips I
have a really sort of red color right
here and that stops somewhere so for me
it stops in my shape that I have
everyone on planet earth has sort of a
white highlight line above the colored
part of their lips everyone has it if I
google a person right now I can show you
a white sort of highlighting line above
their natural lip color this ladies and
gentlemen is the line that you can
follow over draw to make your lips look
fuller why I put the highlight on my
lips first is to really show you that
line you can see that right here you see
that white line that is the line you can
go over with your lipstick and as long
as you stay on top of that line you're
safe your lips will look fuller more
plump more there but without it looking
too much and this is also sort of like a
guideline for how far you can go with
your lipstick if
you go over this white line right here
you know you've gone too far and this is
sort of like instead of staying in the
colored part of your lips which is like
your natural lip and staying really
close and really small and really tiny
um you go over it and you make your lips
look more plump I think showing you it
would be easier I'm gonna take my lip
mix by Mac in crimson and this is my
favorite red lipstick and I'm just gonna
take that because with red people seem
to understand things faster okay and the
brush I always used to do my lips and
clients lips is the Mac 231 this is
perfect if I would follow my natural lip
so the colored part of my lip my lips my
top lip especially will look like this
so this is about as far as I could go if
I would follow my natural lip color now
can you see that white line still yeah
we can see it that is as much as you can
still put on that is how far you can go
and once I go on top of that white line
my top lip has so much more like body
and volume without it looking too much
so can you just see the difference like
wait so I'm just gonna finish my lips
off right now in my sort of full way by
going on top of that white line and then
you will see that my lips look plump
they look volumize they look really sort
of full but it doesn't look unnatural it
just looks as if you have like Angelina
Jolie lips in a really natural way and
because it's my quick tip on how you can
make your lips look fuller without going
overboard and without doing too much and
let's be honest I did my lips the same
way today and do I look like a drag
queen right now maybe a little but not
really too much because of the lips I
just I don't think though and I do want
to mention that this goes the same way
for your bottom lip as well I have
enough volume in my bottom lip so I only
do it on my top lip but this is how you
can naturally make your lips look fuller
with lipstick without going overboard so
I hope this was useful for a full list
