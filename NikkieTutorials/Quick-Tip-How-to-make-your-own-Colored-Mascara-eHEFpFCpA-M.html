of you are gonna hate this and some of
you are gonna love this um this is more
for the artistic like take a close-up of
your eye makeup or like for a runway
thing we all know the colored mascara
that are in store and we're like that's
cool but I'm only going to use that like
once in my entire life
we all do that I came up with this way
that I saw it via can me from my teacher
skull to sir she takes eye pencils and
she melts the product down and grabs a
spoolie and applies it to the eyelashes
with that technique you can apply any
eyelash color that you want as long as
you have a like like a pencil color of
it so let's say if you want orange
lashes or pink lash just grab a pink eye
pencil and just put it on your lashes so
this is just a quick tip it's going to
be short video I hope and if you want to
know how to make your own colored
mascara out of eye pencils then please
keep on watching
okay so the products you're going to
need for this quick tip are one or two
spoolie z' as police look just like
disposable mascara ones you know those
of course you want to need some eye
pencils and of course a lighter oh I
needed a boom okay so the very first
thing you're going to do is curl your
lashes of course because we're not using
mascara so that lift we have to create
that so we're going to take some eyelash
her lips these are my shoe breath and
just curl the lashes you're going to
take a spoolie this is one by fuze I'm
Pro my mom sells this inner webshop
you're going to take your lighter and
the color you want to start off with
this is max a marine ultra chroma
graphic pencil and really you guys it's
so simple all you're going to do is
you're going to take your liner and heat
up this eye pencil from Mick the marine
ultra one and then put that stuff put
that I pencil on to spoolie and use it
as mascara it's that easy it's really
easy and now quickly applied as a
mascara and you might have to use a
couple of layers before chose out for
the bottom I'm going to do exactly the
same I'm just using a yellow and I think
that with the yellow one you will see
results better on camera
and then after about two or three layer
this is your end result some color
lashes I know this isn't really a
day-to-day look or that some people
might just hate this video because
what's the use of it but it might come
to use when you're like out of ideas and
you want something unusual or you could
just take brown or something if you
don't have a brown mascara I take a
brown eye pencil saying that is all for
a full list of every single product use
go to my website me tutorials comm um
like my official Facebook page and
follow me on twitter which is
nikkietutorials and i hope you learned
something from this i hope you find it
useful if not i don't know
thank you guys so much for watching i
love you and hopefully i will see you
guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
