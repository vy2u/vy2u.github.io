another quick tip video for you guys and
this is called the three wonders of
hairspray first of all I want to
apologize for being sort of m.i.a
because I actually I have a boyfriend
now I know I know I know I know I know I
know stop it yeah so that is why I've
been kind of missing in action and he's
gonna hate me for that because it kind
of sounds as if he is the fault of all
of that it's not because sort of I am I
am I'm gonna be honest I'm kind of lazy
lately I don't know why I just I've been
the lazy mother fudger lately I'm sorry
I'm gonna work on that I'm back so today
I'm gonna do another quick tip video for
you guys because I know you guys really
like these and um today it's all about
the wonders of hairspray again hairspray
always has been one of my best friends
it like chains my flyaways it is amazing
for for your hair and for like if you
have baby hair so like put them down and
make them stay down but what I think
many of you don't know is that we use
hairspray a lot backstage at the shows
as well and today I'm going to show you
three wonders of hairspray that we use
backstage at the shows and um we go I
guess the first wonder of hairspray is
glitter let's say you're out of your
amazing lit clearly liquid glitter base
let's say you're out of it I don't ever
expect to be out of it but let's say
you're out of it and you have to apply
glitter to your eyes to your body to
your eyebrows to you whatever and you're
out and you want a temporarily sort of
solve for this issue ha ha ha
so glitter and hairspray is a win-win of
course hairspray it shouldn't be in your
eyes but um as long as you keep your
eyes closed while applying the hairspray
and then onto the lid and then put the
glitter on make sure that you just open
your eyes after the glitter has dried
and sort of that you feel that it is
there and it's not gonna budge if you
feel like it's sort of still moist and
sort of wet then don't open your eyes
because you will regret it
I've been there this thick and wonder of
hair spray is eyebrows you all know I'm
a huge fan of eyebrow gels
I love brow gels do you sort of give
yourself that really defined sort of
brow look and it makes them look a
little bit bushy and I like bushy brows
I'm sorry my boyfriend has somewhat of a
bushy brow and I'm obsessed with it I
keep staring in and I'm like put that on
my face no I love eyebrow gels amazing
but I tend to kind of go through them a
lot and an amazing tip that we use
vaccination at the shows is hairspray
oh is it almost went in my eye what you
want to do is take your hairspray by
choice
I love the L net by L'Oreal and your
eyebrow brush comb spoolie slowly you
want to spray your spoolie and then
brush them hairs up and this is sort of
like hair spraying your hair but then
the hair on your face if we really
really really want it like up like
really gif that high fashion sort of
brushed up I browse we use like a really
strong hairspray and then exactly do the
same and then brush him up and
absolutely no brow gel is needed for
this step so that is amazing if you're
not like a brow gel person when you
still want your eyebrows to be defined
and upwards I want to stay Edwards
Twilight is taking over my life lately
and then the last wonder of hairspray is
I know a lot of people are against this
but it works and I am going to be honest
you shouldn't do the
every day you probably shouldn't do this
every week but it works and I got this
from a drag queen friend of mine and I
think you can almost feel what's coming
now if you really want to make your
makeup last all night long all day long
take your hairspray and I'm not gonna do
it because I already did it this week
and keep it at a distance because you
don't want it to be too close by keeping
it a fair distance and then spray mm-hmm
and again I don't recommend you doing
this every day probably not every week
but if you have like a really really
special occasion in your like this face
has to be on me the entire time
trust me this will work I know I'm gonna
get so much hate comments for this but
it works I'm sorry it works it's a
wonder so those are the three wonders of
hairspray and that is just a quick tip
for all of you let me know if you tried
any of these out and if you already use
these tips or if we're gonna try these
