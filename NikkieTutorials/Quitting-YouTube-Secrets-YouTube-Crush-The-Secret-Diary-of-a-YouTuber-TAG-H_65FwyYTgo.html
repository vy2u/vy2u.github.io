secret diary of a youtuber Tagget I got
tagged by Sheeran Pharrell here on
YouTube and I loved her video so Sheeran
think is so so so much for tagging me
because I love getting tagged so in this
heck are 12 questions and they're all
about the YouTube life the secret diary
of a youtuber dog so without any further
ado let's go right ahead and answer
these questions question number one how
long have you been on YouTube I have
been on YouTube for six and a half years
now and dusty Perkins here on YouTube
called me one of the oh geez yeah I
definitely remember the old days where
it was all about panacea 81 X Park HP
true lewd Julie G makeup geek is it's
the oh geez man I was part of the oh
geez and it definitely feels good to
still be around and still be doing this
and still improving my style and my
videos and everything and it feels great
to still be here and it's absolutely
amazing that you're still watching me
and that my channel is still growing
after six and a half years because you
would expect a channel to kind of stop
growing at one point but we kind of keep
going question number two is at what
point do you think you will stop now
there has been a point in my youtube
career that I wanted to stop and that
was last year because I was serving this
youtuber rut I didn't I didn't I didn't
have inspiration I didn't enjoy making
these videos anymore until I had this
amazing conversation with a Serina from
beauty lab and we did a collab together
and that same day we had that talk so
that was simply a sort of crisis point
in my YouTube life because that was
really the year that I was like I don't
enjoy it anymore and I always say that
when I don't enjoy something anymore I
quit and thank God I didn't because
YouTube has been so much fun lately I
really feel that the community is
starting to change gears again in all
honesty I really feel like the cute
all girls really took over the beauty
community these last two years and they
really became the faces of the beauty
community and I kind of was disappointed
in the fact that makeup tutorials and
makeup people kind of stood in the back
and you know didn't really get that much
attention and I talked about this on
Twitter but I feel like the beauty
community is finally changing gears
again I feel like it's tipping over to
the make up side again make up this
becoming cool again in the beauty
community and that is something that I
am so so excited about because as you
know I will always be that artist
playing in the corner waiting to play
with makeup and makeup is my life makeup
is my hearts that makeup is everything
for me and it feels so good to see that
the beauty community is changing gears
towards makeup again I think once the
time is right for me to quit I quit I
don't know when that time it's gonna be
but I know personally for myself I'm
having way too much fun with YouTube
right now and my entire life right now
so I'm not letting go of this Christian
number three is the best thing and I
think the best thing about being a
youtuber you can film pretty on top
ugly on the bottom I'm almost always in
pajama pants or my underwear or
something else horrible
and that is a great great thing I really
love that if you do a lot of YouTube
videos you're your own boss you decide
when you wake up to film and when you go
to sleep after you upload it and it's I
really like having to control myself it
feels good being in control you're the
boss you're the boss lady you can you
can you know decide everything in your
YouTube world number four is the worst
thing and for me personally is that you
work alone a lot I'm a people person I
love interacting with people I love
talking to people I love being around
people and filming for videos a week can
get so lonely because I'm alone in my
room and of course my mom is sad
there's and everything but working with
people is so much different than filming
in front of a camera I kind of see the
inside of my little lens right there as
if all of you are packed in it and I am
talking to you but realistically I'm
alone I'm alone in this room I work
alone I edit alone I edit with my
boyfriend because he is it's kind of
really good with editing he helps me
getting the perfect finishing touches
but other than that I work alone so the
worst thing for me is being lonely
question number five how many thumbnail
options do you usually take oh girl so
many I start with my regular poses which
is usually my regular pose is like this
click and once I have those by looking
in the lens and looking down and all
that I kind of play a bit but mmm some
no options I think about 50 question
number six and you're a youtuber crush
female deci Perkins
I mean if I was a lesbian I would be all
about will be all about you dusty oh my
god is that going too far in their
friendship I love Jesse so much and we
text on a daily basis and she's so
hilarious I mean we had these
conversations that people with a
friendship over six years would have for
example so Jesse Perkins if I if I was a
lesbian I would be all up on that and
Mel I I don't I don't really know if
Joey Graceffa was not gay I would be all
up on that I could still be all up on
that if I wanted to he wouldn't let me I
guess question number seven is who's on
your collab wishlist pixie woo by far
I've been wanting to do collaborations
with them for so long and it might be
happening in November Lisa Eldridge I
mean if I could ever do a collab with
Lisa Eldridge my life would be done I
would I could die in peace question
number eight what are you wearing on
your bottom half I just talked about
this but I've actually right now I'm
wearing black leggings and shoes because
I'm actually heading out after taping
this video so for once I'm actually
put together for once the entire image
is what it's supposed to be and if you
want the proof oh my god
leggings and and shoes question number
nine how long until you actually click
record now this depends if I'm filming a
full-on makeup tutorial including base I
just sit in front of the camera put on
my lights which takes about putting on
my entire lighting setup takes about 15
minutes then I kinda toss up my hair a
little bit and that takes about 20
minutes before I click record because I
just filmed the entire thing but if I'm
doing a tutorial without the base it
takes me closer to a whole damn lot of
time because then I have to do base
eyebrows one eye and that takes close to
an hour and then I have to set up my
lights like an hour and 15 minutes
question number 10 how do you feel about
the YouTube community culture I just
briefly talked about this also but I as
I said I like that it's going towards
the make up side of the world again
other than that I think the people in it
are amazing I'm not gonna lie I have met
gurus who I thought thought a little bit
too much about themselves I mean I I'm
just like this down-to-earth Dutch girl
who you know I try to keep things as
realistic as possible I mean I'm a
youtuber and when people recognized me
on the streets I still remember that I'm
a youtuber I'm not an a-list celebrity
I'm not a Beatle celebrity goddamn not
even a V lister I think it's important
to stay true to who you are and be as
humble and real as you can be and I'm
not gonna lie I have met youtubers where
I was like okay take it down a few
you're a youtuber you're not Britney
Spears but overall I love the beauty
community the YouTube community I think
the people in I think most of the people
in it are
amazing so humble so kind so helpful
except I wish that some of the people
here would act normal question number 11
what's your secret to a successful
Channel
I don't really know because I've been
doing this for six and a half years and
I'm at 585 thousand subscribers right
now that is insane but I see other girls
who did YouTube for like a year and they
are already past my subscriber count so
you wouldn't really ask me how to become
the most successful channel because I'm
not but my number one rule is to always
be yourself always stay true to yourself
only put up videos that you are 100%
happy with so many times I wanted to put
up videos and then I didn't because I
didn't like either the end result or the
way I talked or the way I look but I
think the number one most important rule
is to be yourself don't put up an act
because people will look through that
eventually and I think one of the most
important things is good lighting and
good audio
I definitely love a YouTube guru more
when they have good lighting SuperDuper
awesome backgrounds and good audio
that's what I look for in a good channel
and the last question is number 12 who
do you tag now I know a lot of people
have done this already but I'm just
gonna put a few in the info box down
below so that I can actually look up if
they did it already so check it out if
you want to see if you're tagged other
than that oh and I think you get so much

with a camera thank you so much for

much for watching and hopefully I will
