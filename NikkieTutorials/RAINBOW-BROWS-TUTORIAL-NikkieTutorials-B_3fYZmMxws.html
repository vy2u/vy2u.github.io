I've been caught I believe it's time for
me to finally spill the truth it is time
to sip the tea after simply no logical
followed my makeup tutorial one thing
that everybody noticed is that I rarely
show how I do my brows on camera and
that is for a good reason
the secret is I don't do my brows I have
a clone that doesn't form no kitty
pretty much ever since that video people
have been asking me hey why don't you
ever show us how you do your brows and
to me is just one of those redundant
steps that take way too long in a video
if you see it 27 times in a year you get
bored of it that's just how life works
so about two years ago I did my last
updated brow routine and to me I'm like
that's it don't need to do any more
brows stuff but the people disagree so
my lovely glow babies in today's video
I'm finally showing you an updated Bravo
teen but it's not like the brows that I
do every day this is a long intro
considering you all are at the title of
this video already and you all know that
I'm doing rainbow brows so today's video
I'm gonna be doing my brows on camera
just to please you guys to please my
glow babies and to get rid of the
conspiracy theory saying that I have a
clone that does my brows or that I don't
ever do my brows and a guest artist does
inform me that is what today's videos
gonna be all about I'm so excited to sit
down and get creative and colorful and
to kick it up a notch so let's go
alright my face is pretty much gone
because of the coverage lips never heard
of her face she's been missing for weeks
alright so let's do these rainbow brows
and I did want to mention that one of my
favorite youtubers and my favorite
makeup artist Rocio just did a brows
tutorial as well
rainbow brows tutorial as well so please
go check her out I'll put the link in
the screen somewhere so you can check
her out and I just there's little shadow
cuz I love her work so much okay so when
thinking of how a rainbow goes I'm just
gonna pull up my own picture because you
know self promos everything these days
so when I look at my own picture I see
that the warm side I want to do this to
my brows so one brow is a warmer rainbow
and then the other brow is a cool tone
rainbow and then
together they're the full rainbow so I'm
starting off with this one being the
warm yeah so I want this one being the
warm one so I'm starting off with yellow
going into orange them red and a little
bit of purple and then this side the
cool side should be yellow green blue
purple and then yes
so the first brow pomade I'm grabbing by
Kat Von D is that this one right here
this one is called a Scarlett and I'm
starting off pretty much in the center
and then work my way outwards all right
so the first thing I'm doing is brushing
my hairs up so I see a clear line
underneath now dipping my brush into the
products and I only need a tiny bit
probably because knowing Kat Bundy it's
really big we're good and I'm just gonna
start placing a line underneath
so right there just in the center giving
up some more and working it through the
brow brushing the hairs down a bit so we
can see the line there we go and I'm
just brushing it out using soft strokes
to kind of diffuse the edges now this is
a new proud look we're done goodbye this
could be a look
I mean Gucci going in with a little bit
of the magenta color and just continuing
towards the outer third of the brow
almost and the tail I want to make
purple
so just brushing them together and if
you see any of this bumpy stuff
happening over here don't worry we got
concealer we'll carve it out we'll make
it look like perfection just get the
color on and blend it out nicely
purple time this is Roxy purple and with
this one I'm just making my tail and
blending it in with the pink I remember
years ago I believe it was 2011 when I
went to New York City for the first time
in my life and actually going to America
for the first time in my life and I
remember going to IMATS IMATS was the
first makeup show I've ever gone to in
my life and I remember meeting a girl
that had rainbow brows like I'm doing
right now and it's back in 2011 she is
the stunning chocolate girl so beautiful
and just the rainbow brows against her
dark luscious skin was the pure makeup
porn to me this is like a little homage
to her right now we're looking at an
Instagram brow and not just the shape
it's the colors because this literally
Instagram and just missing the white now
I'm going in with the yellow and I'm
putting this at the front not all the
way because I want like little hair
strokes in the front so just fading it
in and then we do the hair strokes
and see how as soon as you start buffing
it in with the red the orange just kind
of pops up and creates that gradient for
you we lost a little bit of our red so
pushing that back in there we go you
know I wonder if a nice little spooley
jiggle will blend it even more for me
and upon further investigation it does
picking up the yellow on a more precise
brush and drawing in a couple of hairs
at the front which you absolutely for
the life of you can trace so skip that
step
so this brow is looking like a pretty
rainbow to me now remember the little
doodoo we made we're gonna clean it up
so I'm going in with my radiant creamy
concealer by NARS we're just gonna carve
this into perfection now an essential
step is that you press the concealer on
to carve it out because as soon as you
start smearing the colors it's going to
mix with your concealer and it's just
gonna become like a little pastel a mess
so you want to stamp two cars and that
will leave the color intact
and now if you're doing your eye makeup
would be the perfect time to patent that
I base that eye primer and continue
using your shadows but that is the first
rain brow done for the other brow like
the other brow I'm starting off in the
center and the center color would be a
blue so I'm going in with a satellite
blue pushing this in this color is so
intense I love it I'm already noticing
how I went too low here as opposed to
this brow but no worries if this happens
to you carve it out with concealer later
going in with the purple again for the
tail nice little spooley action to blend
that is like the magic trick of the
video next up green
and finally yellow
all righty there we go now let's carve
it out and that guy's is the rainbow
brow and nice gradient all across the
two brows and that's you complete the
look I'm gonna go in with the brand new
palette by juvies plays that this is
brand new and it is so stunning look at
it look at this look at it oh oh my god
this is a golden neutrals dream so I'm
not gonna show you what I'm doing with
the eye cuz it's gonna be so soft I want
all the attention to go to the brows of
course I'm just gonna do the most simple
look ever and then I'll be right back
and that guys is my rainbow brows
tutorial sighs tryout video completed
what do you think I think this is so
much fun this would be perfect for pride
this will be perfect for a rainbow party
or like a very colorful themed party
this is for whenever you want to taste
that rainbow so yeah thank you guys so

world don't forget to give this video a
