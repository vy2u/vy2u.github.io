up thinking today I'm going to finally
do a black widow inspired makeup
tutorial question was am I going to do
Iggy Azalea or am I gonna do Rita Ora
and up until like two o'clock this
afternoon I could not make my decision
but time was ticking and I needed to
film something and I couldn't really
decide which one to go for so I was like
why not do a rainbow eye yeah without
any further ado if you want to know how
to get these rainbow eyes then please
stay tuned okay so the first thing I'm
doing is applying a base to my eyelids
to prevent the eyeshadows from creasing
and to make the colors pop a lot more
than they normally would and for this
I'm using Mac soft ochre Paint Pot then
to give my crease some definition I'm
taking Mac's sculpting powder in taupe
and I just take a little bit of that and
start applying it to my crease and with
really soft movements you want to go
from outer to inner corner and then
blend up really softly now I'm taking
the Mac shaping powder in emphasize and
with emphasize I'm highlighting my brow
bone and blending down that taupe color
that we applied previously and this way
it will get an even nicer blend and also
I like to load this up on the inner
corners and blend up right here for the
lid of taking that Mac emphasized powder
again and mixing it with makeup geek
eyeshadow in shimma shimma and I'm
applying this combo to my lid area a
nice light neutral shimmery color to
make the bright color stand out even
more I'm going to start off by taking
Savitch from the Urban Decay electric
palette and I'm applying this color to
the very inner corner of my eye and this
is going to be
in my beginning point of the eyeliner
and you can make this as thick and
dramatic as you want I'm going to go
quite far with it because I love that
next up is sugar pills of flame point I
shadow you want to place a flame point
right in the middle of the line and
blending the edges with savage and you
just want to keep reapplying the colors
until you get the desired intensity and
color payoff and then at the end I like
to wet my brush with a little bit of
water and trace the top to get a nice
clean edge
next in line a little bit of red this is
a love plus by sugarpill and you guessed
it this is going right next to flame
point and again you want to blend the
edges in with the previous color and
just drag that to the outer corner of
your lashes your lash line for the wing
I'm using a purple this is sugar pills
poison plum and you want to make your
wing with this and from the outer point
of your wing drag it back to the red
then you guess it you want to fill that
in and eventually blend the edges with
the red so I'm taking a bit of that red
and reapplying it in between that orange
and the purple to give a really nice
ingredient know what you can do is throw
a little bit of mascara and false lashes
on this look and you're done color today
and you have a really nice rainbow
eyeliner I'm however going to take it
all the way so I'm going to take the
cooler shades of the rainbow and apply
those to the bottom part of my eyes so
for the blue which is going on the outer
part of my lower lash line from my Urban
Decay electric palette I'm going to take
chaos and gonzo and I'm just applying
them really close to the roots of my
lower lashes connecting to the purple
for the green portion I'm taking sugar
pills Midori and Urban Decay's electric
thrash and this is going onto
the middle of my lower lash line and I'm
going to drag it down quite far because
I want to give the lower portion of the
eye this really nice grungy sunken-in
feel and it kind of blends in better
with these sort of eye jewelry then I'm
going to apply later on then to open up
the inner corners a bit more I am
dragging down my new inner corner so I'm
going to create this new inner corner
illusion by just dragging a line a
little bit further away from the actual
inner corner and then to open that eye
up and use my last color of the rainbow
which is yellow and going in butter
cupcake by sugarpill and I like to
really load that up on that new inner
corner that we created you just want to
fill that line up and pack it on on the
inner corner area right here and bam
your rainbow is all the way I am quickly
highlighting my inner corners using that
emphasized powder by Mac then run a
little bit of milk jumbo pencil by NYX
on the waterline there now I'm going to
take this super gorgeous meal decoration
sort of it's not a sticker it's sort of
like a little you know a little piece of
paper and I thought because this has a
really nice triangular shape to it why
not place it on the middle of my lower
lash line and that gives this really
nice sort of you know golden touch to
the look so I'm gonna grab a little bit
of glue place a little dot and you know
put this over top and then we have this
really nice eye decoration going on to
finish off the look I'm taking my makeup
Cydia waterproof 3d extra black mascara
and over top of that my XO Beauty
soulmate eyelashes are cheeks I wanted
to go really bronzy and shimmery and
high-fashion glowy so that's exactly
what we're gonna do today
so first gonna carve out my cheekbones
with my heroine eyes shadow by
Illamasqua
give yourself them supermodel chicks
then tip Browns up my skin I'm taking
this Mac bronzing powder in refined
golden and just taking a tiny teeny bit
of that because we don't want to take it
too far so I'm taking refined golden and
first just bronzing up my forehead quite
a bit and then just you know just it
onto the highest points of your cheeks
kind of showing it with your contour for
blush I'm taking one of my favorites
this is max a launch away powder blush
just taking a tiny teeny bit of that and
popping that on the apples of my cheeks
and then blending back into my contour
this is not per se the brightest of
blushes and that is exactly what I want
because I mean can we look at the eyes
so how am I going to use this a new
discovery this is been night luxe powder
in ice and this just gives the most
beautiful high shine glow ever it's
beautiful for photography like if you
use this on a shoot and you dust is over
the high plains of your models cheeks oh
my god high-fashion glow so I'm taking a
bit right on the highest point of my
cheekbone I'm a oh my god I mean hello
okay so placing it there then also
swooping it right underneath meeting up
to that blue color then blend it out
here and diffuse the edges then take a
little bit more and pack it on right in
the middle and then hello plastic cheek
but we're not done I'm taking more of
that highlighter and brushing it on this
point right here in my nose right a
little scoop is brush it there then I'm
taking a really tiny concentrated pencil
brush and on the highest tip of my nose
and placing a little dot of the
highlighter little dot and that just
lifts your nose up makes it look really
cute as a button makes it look as if you
have a little
button on your nose but I just love
using that trick to give my nose a more
lifted feel for lips I'm going to keep
it nude and neutral and glossy just
because I want all the attention to go
to this creation right here so first I'm
going to give my lips a little bit more
depth and volume using my world lip
pencil by Mac kylie jenner woo woo
then for lipstick I'm using my trusty
hourglass a nude number one femme nude
lipstick this is my go-to nude lipstick
whenever I have crazy eyes because this
lipstick just goes with everything and
then to seal it with a gloss I'm taking
Gerard cosmetics a shimmer of hope and
that guy's concludes this a rainbow eyes
