recreate my first video ever what what
is happening oh my god I've been getting
requests to do a video like this for the
longest time now and um to be honest
with you I was kind of scared cuz mama
life isn't always this fun 7 or 8 years
ago my channel but in all seriousness
today I am here to look back to my first
video I posted on YouTube here ever that
has been 7 to 8 years ago a lot a lot of
things I've changed in 7 to 8 years and
a month ago when I planned winter wonder
week I had this video planned for today
and I woke up this morning to 6 million
and I woke up this morning to 6 million
followers here on YouTube and my mind is
blown I like I can't even handle or
process what is happening here like how
full circle is it that I have this video
planned a month ago and now today when I
have this video planned looking back to
the past and I had 6 million colors this
is so surreal to me thank you so much I
love you so much
so yeah looking back to my first video
ever I love how it started with a black
screen it's like it's a surprise
oh that accent Oh first of all girl that
angle girl that everything so this was
recorded 7 to 8 years ago and when I
look back to my first video I see a very
insecure young girl who has been through
a lot and has no idea what is supposed
to happened to her later on in her life
but I got bullied so much for my height
I'm 62 and when you're a kid and you're
anything but normal
you are weird and you get bullied on so
I got bullied a lot for my height for my
weight for my face it made me so
insecure and it made me so ashamed of
myself almost that I when I started
rolling into YouTube and the makeup
community it was sort of like my it was
like my alter ego I could put all this
makeup on and become this invincible
untouchable fierce and strong woman that
I never could be in real life and when I
look back at this very insecure little
phase right here I wish I was there to
tell her that you know everything was
gonna be all right
oh girl step hug you know yo ass girl it
wrinkles what am i doing shut oh I love
how I almost had an English accent in my
dear Lord circular motion
Oh bury em I love that brand back in the
day I also think it's so funny that I
went for a green look I have never been
a huge huge or like green fan so for me
to do my first video with green eye
shadows like girl what were you thinking
makeup had the ability to show me that
you know I didn't have to beat that
bullied girl who was so insecure and
like not feeling herself at all and I
could be the strong woman as soon as I
just did that powder on and created this
crease I just I felt invincible and that
is what makes makeup so beautiful to me
it's not just the makeup art it's the
part of transforming yourself and
feeling yourself and feeling strong and
invincible and like nothing can touch
you because you have your armor on and
it's not like oh my god you have to wear
a layer upon layer upon layer no but
it's like this armor of confidence and
that is what makes makeup so beautiful
and amazing to me and that makes it so
much more than just makeup thank you for
always allowing me to be myself and for
always allowing me to go a little hand
with makeup every now and then but you
always were there having my back
supporting me show me warmth show me
love and I literally grew up on YouTube
I was 14 years old I'm 22 now I can't
imagine what kind of person I would have
been today without YouTube because it
made me stronger it made me more
confident and it made me feel good about
myself you made me feel good about
myself
alright so enough blabber I'm gonna go
right onto recreating this look right
here I took inspiration from it and
applied the techniques that I know of
today and try to make it modern and of
this time of this Nicki right now that
feels so much better about herself but
we've come a lot especially those brows
girl we've come a long way I definitely
encourage you tweeting your favorite
gurus who've been around for a while to
do this as well yeah without any further
ado if you would like to know how 28
Nicki looks like 26
T Nikki in today's makeup look then keep
on watching
all right so here we both are um what a
freaky difference oh my god all right
baby show me what you got all right so I
already did my base and eyebrows because
I always saw Marlena makeup geek do her
brows and base before filming so to me
that was what I had to do so I don't
quite remember what I did for foundation
or all that stuff I do know that my
brothers were hotness what are these
eyebrows girl what you doing I will not
be recreating this beautiful brow a
break and judging by this photo I had no
freaking clue what foundation was I see
all that redness I see all those pimples
coming through all right you know what
let's do a little dora the explorer here
as always the first thing I'm using is
exactly
to help blending later on I'm going to
grab this Mac powder to set my crease
and brow bone area this is in the color
emphasized I'm going to hop into my
morphe 35o all matte palette and taking
this color as a transition color in my
crease and if there's one thing I wish I
knew sooner it is a transition color
this has really lifted my makeup game to
the next level because everything just
looks so much more blended and perfected
now going in this color right here to
build definition on the outer corners
and I'm doing this mainly to shape my
eye more I have hooded eyes and seven
years ago my eyes used to be even more
hooded because I have such a huge
forehead it kind of lifted my eyes up
with it a little bit so I am thankful
for that but I've definitely learned
that placing definition on the outer
corners is really going to lift it all I
remember using this green pigment by
gosh from the drugstore for the green on
the inner third of my lid looking back
now that had no pigment whatsoever
so today I'm going in with this awesome
amazing beautiful insane eyes shadow by
makeup geek this is called lime light
and this is going on the inner third of
my lid this is everything I always bring
my lid colors way up to mimic a bigger
eye for the center of the lid and going
into this Cosette green shadow right
here this is this is really pretty
and now going in with Mac's femme no are
too deep in that outer corner even more
for the outer corner of my lower
lashline and going back in with that
darker Brown we applied in the crease
and I love how nowadays I'm not afraid
to go down with my eyeshadow on the
lower lash line before I would use to
keep it really small or nothing at all
but now I smoke it out baby
from there and going on with the color
that I also use as my transition color
in the crease and to really open up my
hooded eyes what I love doing is
blinding my inner corners today going in
with the jus a highlighter in the color
ice for an extra touch of yumminess and
going into this makeup geek eyeshadow in
the color epic and use this as a smudged
out liner and lastly for lashes i'll be
using Lily lashes Miami I was so scared
of applying lashes like three years into
my entire YouTube journey a little by
little I started wearing them more and
more and now I can't live without him
um past Nikki thank you so much for just
doing your eyes and nothing else on
camera but reminiscing of the past I
know that contouring was like what
highlighter I didn't even start wearing
highlighter till like four or five years
into my youtube journey hmm what was I
thinking
but how times have changed so I recently
found out about this technique in one of
my videos this winter wonder week so I'm
going to go into my road isle contour
powder and this morphe brush and I'm
just gonna get some of that contour
powder and I'm going to cut my cheeks in
half for blush today I'm gonna go into
joues blossom and for a highlighter I
can't believe I was in a glow getter
before but I definitely am right now I
can't get enough of this this is joues
ice it's oh it's so good I'm gonna go in
with my Sigma F oh six brush ephra lips
I definitely remember always sticking to
new lips if you've been with me since
the beginning you know that with every
eye look I did a new lip and I was
afraid of dark colors brown colors
bright colors it it used to beat nude
and nude only so I'm gonna panda Maj to
that and keep it nude today but of
course it's looking new anything you
want with it you can do red to make it a
super Christmasy look but you can do
anything you want with it I'm gonna go
in with my Tom Ford nude vanilla
lipstick this is so pretty
and then of course they'll lock it all
into place some setting spray and that
