three I'm never nervous for anything and
right now I'm just oh hi guys so today I
have a very very exciting announcement
for you I'm going to reveal something
that I've been working on for so long
now and I'm so excited for you to
finally see this today I am here to
reveal my next collab of my
collaboration please with open arms and
a warm heart say hello to my
collaborator with us this right here is
my collaboration with Oprah cosmetics
and I am so honored that we partnered up
for this and a week off I'm so proud
we literally have so much fun making
this collaboration for you guys and can
I just say I'm obsessed with my box we
worked really hard on it and now you're
going to see my promo shop which were
after really proud of because Rick shot
this say hello to the back of my Oprah
collaboration box over Christmas and I
collaborated on three custom liquid
lipstick shades designed by me one
product that I'm just I'm going to open
it up now and one product that I'm so so
lipping proud of if you watch my channel
you know that I'm all about the glow
like glowing is like the bits like my
existence if I couldn't glow I wouldn't
be here and Oprah and I created our own
highlighter wheel and I am so frickin
proud of this I'm just going to dive
right into this I'm just going to go
show you the products now I the fact
that I'm actually showing you this right
now it's crazy to me so say hi to my
highlighter named ever glow ever glow is
my little baby that I'm so incredibly
proud of because it is truly the most
beautiful glow for every skin tone out
there in ever glow comes a three
blinding highlighting shades one for the
fair makeup junkie a medium for everyone
who's right in between and a beautiful
warm
ron's for all my dark-skinned divas out
there so my entire philosophy with ever
glow is that I wanted everyone to have
the ability to shine makeup haters eyes
out to glow everyone from Mars and back
and make it possible for every skin tone
out there this color right here suits
the fairest of them all like Snow White
got nothing on this one the medium is of
course beautiful on my bronzed babes and
the copper is just under skin tones it's
so rich so captivating I love it so much
but my favorite thing about it is when
you feel that one color is too dark for
you or one colors do you like for you
you can mix and match so let's say
you're right in between the fairest of
them all and the medium shade you can
mix these two together to create your
custom perfect shade that matches your
skin tone perfectly and I feel like with
this we have a globe that fits anyone
and everyone on planet earth I'm also
wearing the lightest shade of ever globe
currently on my inner corners and the
copper of ever glow is on the center of
my lid so if these doesn't work as
highlighters for you you can use them as
eyeshadows next up I created three
liquid lipstick shades and I really
wanted to be there a color for everyone
again and I really wanted them to you
know say close to my style of makeup and
what I really love and makeup so of
course I have to go for my favorite nude
color it's nude but it's not like
deathly and I we also my previous video
where I looked a little looking sealer
lip but I loved it this is far from it
and this liquid lipstick is called nude
potion and to me truly it is that it is
a new potion is just all these nude
colors combined and just this potion
this magical potion came out we have
felt now spell is a second little one
because the base of spell is like a neon
coral Orange but it has a pinky pew chef
reflective metallic anise to it so this
one is a crazy shapeshifter like in some
lights is a true beautiful coral neon
but in other life the pinky metalness
really comes through it's really hard
for me to explain but it's like a weird
twist of
neon coral was like a pinky metallic
sheen it's it rocks my world this color
is very out there I definitely wanted to
include a bright color in there for all
my makeup junkies who live for the color
and that only is this one amazing on the
lips is also stunning as a colorful
eyeliner for spring and summer next up
is coven coven is a beautiful warm
bronzy chocolate color that has a
metallic finish to it so for all of you
waiting to shine from the mouth
it sounds so wrong but to shine from
your mouth you can finally do it it's a
beautiful chocolate color it's very rich
this under skin tones is pure and utter
sexual mist
so this is everything you will find in
my collaboration with Oprah and now
let's just I feel naked these lips are
looking across to you they need a little
bit of lovin and I need to glow so let's
play with these all right so my cheeks
are feeling very left out so let's go
into ever glow and I'm going to go in
with the lightest color first to really
blind them all
alright picking some up with my
highlighter brush let me grab a mirror
okay I can't as a mirror and then baby
going this makes me so unhappy
I think Oprah is definitely known for
creating one of the most beautiful glows
out there I love their formula I love
the Beverly Hills one they made and it
just really convinced me that Oprah was
the right one to do this clever mo as
you know I am super super fair and as
you can see the lightest shade of ever
glow is all right that is one cheek
feeling one hell of a lot better let's
go on to the next and I love that you
have full control over this you can
really build it up to make it you know
but you can also keep them very soft and
subdued and natural and of course you
are
ah will you just look at I'm upset all
right now let's go ahead and see what
the look colors look like on my face
let's first start out with nude potion
and this has made some cameos in videos
before so for those of you with a sharp
eye you've seen this before but let's
just do it against is probably my
favorite
so this is what nude potion looks like
on my face now if you're familiar with
the O for a consistency and formula you
know that they are such a beautiful
beautiful liquid lipstick they stay on
beautifully but they never like dry out
your lips next up is the shade coven one
of my favorites is so rich so deep so
mysterious love it and here we have
coven dark mysterious and sexy and I
must say I'm loving it with these eyes
right here it's like oh now get ready to
see this duochrome e shapeshifter spell
and I will say with this color because
it's got that metallic mist to it you
can have to caress it and senesce it
into the lips to get that perfect Sheen
so so in order to get that full metallic
miss and to get that color shift make
sure you end your lips by doing one
sweep to one side is in this color so
cool and unique I've never seen a color
like this it is so crazy it is perfect
for summer and spring and just imagine
this as a liner this one right here does
need the most love out of all the
products and coming out with it does
need a little bit of a softer hand spend
messing it into the lip but once you
have it on its going to stay there and
it's going to look amazing and
phenomenal and you're going to blind
everyone with your brightness alright so
it put call them back on because it's my
favorite with the eyes but even if
you're feeling frisky you can grab a
little bit of the copper and brush that
over coven the possibilities are all
right so after showing you all of this
now of course you're going to be
wondering okay girl but how much this
