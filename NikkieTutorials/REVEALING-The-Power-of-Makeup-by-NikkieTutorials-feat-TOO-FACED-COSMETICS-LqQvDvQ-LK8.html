like really weird day to me because
after a year of working on it I am here
to reveal my collaboration with - face
to face and I have worked on this
limited edition the power of makeup
collection by me nikkietutorials and
here it is guys here is the box I've
waited for a good year to tell you about
this and to be actually showing you this
and being here in my studio and actually
being able to show it on camera here is
so surreal so here it is the power of
makeup by nikita toriel's in
collaboration with two-phased and we
have created a limited-edition
collection so it's not just one product
it's not just two products we have a
bunch of products this collection the
power of makeup collection comes with
and eyeshadow palette a full-sized
sketch marker eyeliner in black a deluxe
shadow insurance eyeshadow primer a
highly exclusive purple better than sex
mascara and of course my collection
wasn't complete without some glitter and
this is a beautiful deluxe glamour dust
glitter and literally let's start with
what I'm most excited for my palette oh
my god let me let me let me just oh can
you just look at it just just look at it
just for a second just take it all in
take a look so this right here is my
power of makeup palette and it comes
with nine eyes shadows two blushes a
bronzer and of course a glow so let me
walk you through each and every shade
and the meaning behind it and how we
chose this shade and let's go
so the first shade right here is called
ivy and if you follow me on snapchat you
know I have a very cute fur baby called
ivy she is my little dog and she is my
life I love her so much she's a crazy
nut ball
and as you know I always set my crease
to brow bone area using a lighter matte
shade but I never found the perfect
shade for me because I'm so fair and I
feel like with certain textures of
eyeshadows it just didn't really make
the eye should I put over top pop now
with ivy this is one of those colors
that I would put in my crease the brow
bone area - how
blending and to make everything pop a
little bit more it works great as the
primer it works great as like to even
out your skin tone if your my skin tone
it's just one of those perfect eraser
colors it's matte its creamy its buttery
it's just everything I wished for in a
nice light highlighter shade next up is
sugar-coated and sugar-coated I chose
because I just love the pink shades I
mean look at my background I just love
the color pink but I also love my touch
of glam so I wanted a light baby pink
that had such an luxurious and shiny
feel to it and it's infused with these
hi shiny pink sparks it's just a dream
of the eyeshadow plus if you're my skin
tone it's also beautiful as a
highlighter to blind every makeup hater
out there and it's one of my favorites
of the entire palette next to that I
have frosted YUM
so a little thing about this palette is
that I wanted it to be super versatile
so you have your neutrals you have your
glam shiny shades you have your colorful
shades smokey shades this palette is
just so versus how to take on the go
with you or when you're on holiday you
just want one palette to take with you
and be done and I really feel like this
will do that for you so when I chose the
frosted yum I went for silver and gold
as I said I love my glam I love my
silver I love my gold so I went for both
silver and gold so frosted YUM is my
silver which is a very I'm wearing it on
my lids today Frost um and it's just
such a beautiful silver that is like
actual silver and so as I said we also
created a gold this is irresistible
because to me gold is ruthless
irresistible is just a beautiful rich
gold perfect 4 on the lid if you're a
deeper skin tone perfect to highlight
with on the inner corners brow bone it's
just a perfect gold now this is where it
gets fun painkiller you know in almost
every look I do I need my perfect like
mid Brown transition color to blend a
smoky eye like a pro and there are so
many medium Browns out there to use as a
transition shade but I almost felt like
a lot of them out there are kind of
patchy and they don't really
and they just make your blending life
harder so I came up with painkiller and
that's why I called a painkiller you
just swipe it in that crease without
even thinking about it and voila you
have just an amazing transitioned
eyeshadow I right next to it is makeup
and chill and it's sort of the same as
painkiller as with painkiller you just
work it in that eye and you don't even
have to think about it it just does all
the work for you and same goes for
makeup and chill I love you know me you
know me by now I love my warm dark brown
eye shadows and makeup and chill is you
just put it in there and you till you
make up and chill you don't have to
think about it it just does everything
for you
painkiller and makeup and chill are in
my crease it it's just when we were
creating the shades and we were like
picking all the colors and trying to
come up with new stuff hricko's you need
a kind of bluish greenish one and the
entire team goes what do you say so we
go damn he's right we do need a like D
blue almost teal ish greenish color so
we created it and out came a mystic hour
probably my favorite shade of the entire
palette because it's so unique and we
all over to this one so in the comments
let's just say I bow down to you Rick
for mystic our mystic hour is like this
deep mysterious teal blue green shade I
don't know any eye shadow like it it is
super buttery super intense super
mysterious and sexy and to be honest
it's my favorite shade out of the entire
palette because it's just so unique it
is so easy to work with
and stop to just stop the color next to
that wham bam is a very special purple
to me purple is my favorite color I love
everything purple and when we were
creating these shades Jared was drinking
coffee out of the Coffee Bean mug with a
very blinding purple coffee bean straw
and we were creating the shadows and the
first thing I said was that straw
I want that color to be an eye shadow my
palate so we created around five purples
and all of them just didn't
I do it to me and they just weren't as
vibrant and intense as that coffee bean
straw so in came the sixth color and it
was perfection realized this is such a
unique purple because it's bright and
out there but it has this Sheen to it
that makes it even brighter and almost
glowing like just like that coffee bean
straw so wham man has a very funny story
to it and after six purples we finally
managed to get the perfect purple and
it's just okay the last I should have
color I have for you is wanted I wanted
a deep dark black because it's just a
necessity in every palate I feel like
every palate needs a transition shade or
warm brown a black a highlighter and
colors to play around with and I feel
like that's exactly what we did here and
wanted is just a very deep like
in-your-face black shadow that's easy to
work with it's buttery
is everything you want from a black eye
shadow and it just concludes the row of
my dreams all right so those are all the
eye shadows the eye shadows we've worked
on very hard and very long then
underneath we have I will always love
you blush this one right here and
justify my love flush and what I did was
I picked my two favorite two face
blushes to take on the goal and I love
my peach blush I love my pink blush
often I just mix them in-between so they
had to be my palette all the way to the
bottom we have chocolate Soleil bronzer
because I love a good bronze and this
bronze is really nice too because it
actually fits a lot of skin tones so not
just my pill pasty-ass because I'm
wearing it as a contour today and might
I say it looks very good so I just
wanted to bronzer that's versatile for
so many skin tones but still like good
enough for us pill pasties out there and
to conclude my palette of course
I mean can you just Oh ever since the
first chocolate bar came up by two-faced
I was obsessed with this eyeshadow
because I used it as a highlighter all
the time someone they asked me if I
wanted to highlight in my palette first
of all I said are you even asking me
this of course and then I said you know
what champagne truffle from the
chocolate bar palette I want that all
over my face and a bigger pen on the go
and that concludes the power of makeup
palette I honestly think that it's an
amazing palette that is versatile for
on-the-go you have your basics but also
your colors to play around with you can
literally just have your face in one
palette so within the box also comes
this little package right here and in
this package you will find the eyeliner
the shadow insurance
the purple better than sex mascara and
my cool bedroom so I've always been a
huge fan of the better than sex mascara
I use it all the time but of course
since purple is my favorite color we
actually made a very exclusive and very
limited edition purple better than sex
and what I love this for is for on the
lower lashes if you put wham-bam on your
lower lashline and then put this mascara
on your lower lashes it's like a glowing
purple haze of amazingness the shadow
insurance of course it keep your look on
all day long without stress and plus a
little fun trick if you put this on your
nose or your t-zone it will keep your
foundation on longer also we also
included a full-sized sketch marker in
black because I love my eyeliner I feel
like a lot of looks just a lot of looks
out there aren't finished until that
flick of fierceness I think these sketch
markers are super pigment I mean like
look like one stripe super black super
super intense and the tip of it is
superfine it reminds me a lot a lot of
my caveny tattoo liner in trooper it's
full size like it's full size and I
saved the best for last
by cleaner so when you've been following
me for a long time you know that I am
Dutch I am NOT from America I am Dutch
so a couple of years back I would
pronounced glittery as literally because
I
just my tongue would enroll like that
and it just didn't work out so whenever
I wanted to say glittery I said glitter
Lee so we called my glitter literally
literally is so amazing because it's
just it's such a transformer it is a
silver toned glitter with orange burnt
orange gold green purple reflex it's
such a transformer I put it over frosted
YUM on the inner parts of my lids today
and it just makes a look so much more
interesting over top of mystic hour this
just creates this most bedazzling eye of
my life it's just glitter Lee is a
glitter my heart beats faster for and
that concludes my power of makeup in
collaboration with the Too Faced
limited-edition collection we've worked
so hard on this I've worked so hard on

entire two-faced team worked so hard on
this and to be able to share this with
