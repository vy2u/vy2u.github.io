taken me like two years to finally do
this video today I'm here to finally do
my video my take on the new Rihanna
Fenty beauty makeup line first of all
before we do anything I just I just want
to give a huge round of applause to
fenty beauty Rihanna for thinking of all
skin tones out there we literally have
the lightest color all the way to the
darkest color
Rihanna came out with the 40 foundation
shades this is how it should be done
there's not just one skin tone out there
on this planet there's so many
variations there's so many skin tones so
many undertones and it's a shame that
most makeup brands just come up with
seven shades and of the seven shades two
of them are kind of dark and not really
dark so before I say anything about the
sign Rihanna Fenty Beauty this is how
you do it and I couldn't be more proud
this I am actually really really excited
to finally play with this I've heard a
lot of mixed reviews I've seen people
wear a trophy wife everywhere on their
face my order finally came in yesterday
so here I am sitting down and I just
want to sit down try the products on
camera give you my first initial thought
and really tell you what I think and
I've noticed that negativity about this
line is very touchy I'm just gonna do it
like I always do give my honest feedback
but be you know respectful of it also
before anyone says if I say anything
negative about any of the products and
people say well you weren't invited to
the party I was actually invited to the
launch which freaked me the hell out but
I had to be with my family so yeah
before anyone tries to come for that I
was invited couldn't make it and I feel
like we've got it all locked and loaded
now so let's play oh my god I'm actually
freaking out a little bit because I've
been waiting for this stuff for so long
so I'm so excited to finally get my
hands on it I personally always think
it's so exciting that when there's a lot
of buzz about a product or a lot of
reviews out there and you don't have the
products in and then the day it comes in
you can finally try it out for yourself
that first plate I'm
is so much fun so I'm so glad that
you're joining me so let's do it alright
so first off the bat I have this primer
right here this is called the soft matte
pro filter looks like this so I'm gonna
be applying it with my hands and I'm
gonna be using two to three pumps so
this is what it looks like it does have
a little bit of color but once you start
smearing it out it starts becoming a
little bit more translucent let's apply
this oh that smells so good oh my god so
as I'm working it in
I feel the primer sort of becoming a
little bit more dry and full so I really
feel it hugging my pores and like this
scent almost reminds me in Holland we
have the soap for babies which is called
spit sell and it cut the scent
almost kind of reminds me of that baby's
schnitzel scent if you have that in
America please let me know but now that
it is drying I'm starting to tap it in
to my skin and it feels very soft it has
a tiniest bit of tackiness to it like
nothing major but there's definitely
something happening it's more like a
hydrated velvety feeling before we step
into foundation I am gonna be playing
with the sponge now texture wise this
sponge almost feels identical to the
Tarte quickie sponge the softness the
bounds the texture for foundations I
have four colors including the lightest
one which is 100 and I actually really
love the meaning behind this this was
actually designed with albino people in
mind so I think that's amazing and as
you can see the foundation is pretty
liquidy it is running down my hand and
once I start sort of buffing it in I do
see a lot of coverage but it feels very
thin and I actually think number 100 is
too light for me so hooray if you are
lighter than my skin tone which is which
is the challenge you have options
pretty much everyone online did say that
it oxidizes
I kind of want to go lighter than I
initially think I should go 120 actually
was sold out and I'm getting the feeling
that my colors 120 I'm gonna make some
130 and 110 coz 130 looks a little too
yellow and when 10 looks a little bit
too light I feel like I'm 120 but I will
never know until am i excited
oh holy ho-oh
Oh was not expecting this coverage
although I will say it it's not like a
full full coverage it's more like a
medium coverage it's just that initial
swipe is pretty like impressive but then
as you're blending it in it loses a
little bit of its coverage see how
you're like oh my god we're off to a
great start but then once you start
working it and it loses a tiny bit of
that coverage so I am noticing that the
foundation dries really really fast so
this is one of those foundations where
you do not want to take your time and
sit down and like chitchat about life
you actually want to keep on blending it
in before it's dry I am noticing that
sometimes it can look a tiny bit streaky
and uneven so I keep going back in and
tapping it to make sure that it goes on
smooth and opaque damn it dry so fast
see what's happening on my nose it kind
of moves and then you have to go back in
to make sure that it's laying down
properly so I've got the foundation
pretty much worked into my skin right
now now for anyone wondering I have
dried to combination skin whereas my
skin overall is super dry but my t-zone
will get oily throughout the day and
break apart foundation really fast and
looking at the mirror really up close
and personal my skin looks like a velvet
mat there is still a little bit of Sheen
going on as you can see right here but
it's it's definitely matte coverage wise
I would definitely give it a medium when
you start building it up too much to
make it a full coverage I feel like the
foundation
slips and slides a little too much and
leaves you with like little little dents
a little patchy marks and a little holes
like I showed you on my nose and it just
starts looking wrong so it does say on
line that you can layer this to a full
coverage but I feel like you have to be
careful with that because it's gonna
it's just not gonna sit nicely I don't
see any major oxidizing going on just
yet I do see that the longer I'm
speaking the more matte and my face is
becoming great now time for the match
sticks I bought a bunch of colors to
conceal with and I also bought the
little set I will be using however the
match stick in ivory this is the
lightest color and I will say that I
think it's a tiny little bit dark
alright so let's see how it goes so it's
definitely more yellow when it comes to
lightness it's about as light as 110 and
130 mix the foundations because it's a
pretty damn match it's just more yellow
okay so I'm working it in and it's
really dry now again I do have dry skin
so maybe this product just isn't for my
skin type but just doesn't want to blend
into the skin nicely it's kind of laying
on top and the more I try to blend it in
to give it a nice finish the more of the
coverage it's losing because my red does
is coming through here but if you're
oily and your under eyes tend to like
eat a product a little bit this is more
of a dry formula so maybe this works for
you okay now that that is secured I do
want to look into the amber matchsticks
this is a contour stick especially for
light skin if you don't know me if this
is your first time watching me I am the
biggest loser at doing cream contouring
I even did a big dedicated video on it
and you can watch it somewhere over here
on the screen so the only product I can
cream contour with this is the
Clarisonic foundation brush and it's the
only tool I can actually blend out my
cream contour with so I will be trying
it with that today if you are a pro and
if you can do with the sponge but all
means show me how it's done because I
can do it
mm-hmm now that is a contour baby I do
really really like the tone of it it's
not too cool it's not too warm it's not
it's a little bit dark but like we still
have to powder our face so um I really
like this tone actually how much are
we're gonna bet on the fact that Rick
thinks the master rating right now so
I'm not gonna powder my face I'm gonna
do my brows and I'm gonna do my eyes and
then I'll be back to talk about all of
the other products all right so I am
back and I quickly did a very easy eye
look I put trophy wife highlighter the
single highlighter called trophy wife
basically the highlighter that everyone
and their mama is talking about I put
that color all over my lid into the
crease blended up the edges and I put
this one and I put this duo highlighter
called the kilowatt highlighter and
lightning dust and fire crystal on the
inner corners a little bit of brown on
the lower lash line and some lashes and
that's a very very simple I look but
honey it may be simple but it is
striking gold I chose to apply trophy
wife on to my lids because I am as white
as paper and if I would apply trophy
wife onto my cheeks as a highlighter it
would look like Mila took of sparkly
piss on my cheekbones
Dana would I'm completely fine with it
there are a billion and one shades of
highlighter for my skin tone so I'm so
proud and so glad to see that there's
finally a unique and interesting shade
for the deeper darker skin tones of this
on deeper skin tones is absolute life I
know it can pull a little bit green on
some people so definitely swatch it
before you buy it in store at Sephora if
not go look up a bunch of the trillion
billion reviews that have been done on
this launch also quickly talking about
the match sticks I really like the
contour shade I feel like it contoured
me beautifully the match sticks are a
cream to powder finish so what happened
for me with my dry under eyes is that
it'll just look like dry ass paper so
the match sticks a for dry under eyes no
if you are oily if you have oily under
eyes I think these will be way better
they will blend way better sit on the
skin way better for me personally yeah
so before we finally go on to contouring
I'm to do a little bit of quick bronzing
some blush okay and then now for my
favorite part the part I'm so the most
excited for the highlighters this one
right here looks like it's gonna be the
best for my skin tone plus it's on my
inner corners this one is a kilowatt
highlighter in the color lightning dust
and fire crystal now I also want to show
you this one this one looks like a
setting powder but this one is actually
the color middle moon and it looks white
in the pan but the sheen / glow of it is
like a golden yellow gold duochrome
the base definitely is very very white
toned but like the sheen of it has that
golden yellow gold
chrome to it these two right here are
really cute I really like this one to
beam up the lid and to like beam your
skin up these are more like blush
poppers to me when I have a blush that I
want to pop a little bit more this is
where it comes in perfectly to give it
that pump but for today I'm just gonna
focus on middle moon and the duo the
lightest shade but what I'm so excited
for this brush when I saw this brush in
all the finta Beauty videos I was like
and they say it is shaped like a shark's
tooth do you see it do you see it so
first I'm gonna dip my brush into this
side right here oh god no see I told you
the match stick is hanging on for dear
life so any movement and friction is
like disrupting it and letting it go so
I see redness of my skin underneath
coming through okay going in with metal
moon
so even though the brush looks amazing
in all the videos right now it's
disrupting my base too much because of
the matchsticks so I'm gonna go in with
my trusty highlighter brush and try to
save the day okay there we go that's way
better and way softer on the skin and I
definitely feel like Rihanna is known
for her beautiful skin like her ultimate
glow so I'm gonna glow to us up even
more especially with the foundation
being so mad I'm okay with pounding on
that glow okay and now it is time to
finish off the look using the gloss
bombs so let me choose my gloss was then
in my package yes so my lip gloss isn't
in my package and I am 100% sure that I
actually ordered it because I was like
look those glosses going on my lips
pretty now I don't have that cloth going
in with this Maybelline lipstick in the
colour beige babe and then putting a
super sparkly gloss over top to kind of
get that look
so here is an extreme up close and
personal look at the foundation on my
skin after everything is done from start
to finish setting spray everything done
and this is what we're looking at now my
under-eye area is a part that I want to
pick from my brain throw out that we
know I never think about again because
the matchsticks did not work for me I
think overall the foundation is okay but
it's just not for a skin type
it's just I'm way too dry but yeah I
just wanted to give you a very up close
look at what we're looking at for this
and that guy's brings me to the end of
this video I feel like the highlighters
are definitely buildable but I expected
a little bit more they are very glittery
instead of glowy I do like the amber
matchstick to cream contour with with
the Clarisonic I feel like they worked
great it blended up really nicely so I
definitely see myself using that more
and more often in the future now I know
that people who love Fanta beauty love
it hard and any negativity surrounding
the brand they fight hardcore but I'm
just here to tell you about my
experience with the products and just
remember that every makeup product works
differently for everybody on planet
earth what may be amazing to me and a
Holy Grail to me might be an oh god no
to you so every skin every person is
different just the fact that they
launched 40 shades is a huge success in
and of itself so I feel like definitely
Rihanna and Fanta Beauty have given an
amazing example and I hope and wish and
do think that brands will follow but
just I'm waiting for a full coverage do
we finish foundation girls so yeah that
is how I experienced these products for
the first time ever if you enjoyed
