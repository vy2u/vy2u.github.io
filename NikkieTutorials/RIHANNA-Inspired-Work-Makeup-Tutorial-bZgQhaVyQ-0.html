requests I'm finally here to do the
Rihanna work inspired makeup tutorial it
was hard to kind of pin down what she
was wearing because she was either in
the shade or humping someone's leg so I
decided instead of going like literal
recreation to give it a little bit more
of a dramatic spin I made my eyeliner a
little bit more seductive and mysterious
and intense so besides from the eyeliner
I think this is pretty close to what
Rihanna was wearing green lips cream
lips people I had so much fun doing this
look for you and if you want to know how
to get it then please keep on watching
all right the first thing we're going to
do is go in with the Kiehl's ultra
facial moisturizer because my skin still
feels very dry so we need all the
moisture we can get for foundation today
I'm going to try something new this is
by Milani and this is their concealed
and perfect two-in-one foundation and
concealer we all know that doesn't work
the two-in-one foundation and concealer
foundation in number one creamy vanilla
and I'm gonna try it out it's my first
time trying it and I cannot wait to see
oh that it has the pump and I'm gonna
apply it using my Beauty Blender Oh Dan
you got coverage baby oh wow
oh yeah I was not expecting it okay so
maybe don't need concealer with this oh
my god oh my god yes Milani okay so far
very good
for concealer today I'll be using the
Make Up For Ever Ultra HD concealer and
this is in the color white when t one
okay now that you look like you belong
to an art museum it's time to blend it
all in
and I'm going to bake using the bed
night luxury powder in cameo okay so
that is the exact same color as my skin
tone so I'm going to go back in using
the NARS soft loose velvet powder in
snow to lighten it a little bit already
priming my eyelids using my Mac soft
ochre Paint Pot and my Sigma 3d HD
precision brush now I'm going to go into
this bell for your eye shadow palette
and taking this light matte color right
here and with my new favorite tweezer
men blender brush I'm just going to set
that from crease to brow bone area and
why I love this brush so much is because
it's big soft and just it takes up a
really wide range of eye space and it
just it's just it's just what you need
in life as my transition shade and going
back into that Belfiore shadow palette
and taking this color right here and for
this I'm using a Mac 224 and also
blending it out on the outer edges right
here just whisking it up and out to get
a nice elongated eye shape you can
always go back in with that tweezerman
brush and a little bit of that skin tone
eyeshadow and blend the edges to make
them super super soft and blown out from
the same palette and taking this dark
chocolate brown shadow and with my
Cosette s 185 I'm just defining the
outer V
so I'm starting off by placing the most
color on the lid on the outer corners of
the lid and then I want to work my way
up into the crease and start softly
blending it in there and whisk it out
you just want to keep doing this until
you feel like you have reached the
darkness that you like and the blend
that you like for the lower lash line
we're going to go into that same dark
brown color and the tweezer men line
glider brush and I'm just really going
to darken and smoke out the lower lash
line with this I really love this brush
because you have such precise color
application yet you still have the power
to blend it out with this brush I mean
look how to find and precise that lower
lash line is just with this brush with
the color pop gel liner in swerve I'm
going to make my waterline black and
then going back in with a dark chocolate
color to smudge the black out and make
it even more smoky now it's time for the
amazing glitter this is Mac's glitter in
gold and as my mixing medium I'll be
using the lit clearly liquid glitter
base and applying it with my little
brush the tweezerman shader brush so
first I'll lay down the mixing medium
with the same brush and then press the
glitter over top
you
for that gorgeous eyeliner first going
to start off using the Tarte so fine
micro liner on the inner corners then
making the outline of my wing using the
tattoo liner by Kat Von D and filling it
all in using my Sigma line ace in legend
all right not to finish off the eyes my
eyelashes need a good curl and today
I'll be using this rose gold tweezerman
eyelash curler and this one especially
is for round your eyes and it's rose
gold so all aboard on the curling train
and we're off okay perfect now some
waterproof mascara to hold that curl her
lashes up using the House of lashes
temptress whispies alright time for the
cheeks now this was kinda hard to find
out what Rihanna was wearing because she
pretty much was in the dark this entire
video so just like the eyes I kind of
made my own spin of it I'm also going to
do that with the cheeks so first I'm
going to contour using my medium
sculpting powder by Kevin tequan and my
favorite contouring brush the morphe m5
30 for some additional warmth v2 faced
milk chocolate bronzer in light/medium
and my Cosette number one brush for
blush I'm going to use the tiniest bit
of Mac's modern Mandarin and because
it's so bright you really want to use a
light hand and the first we'll be using
is my Cosette number two
for a highlighter I'm going to use a
combo of Becca moonstone and Anasazi
Berkeley Hills a sunburst and together
this is just one big lusciousness and
we're gonna go for that ultimate glow I
see a lot of gurus on YouTube also
highlight like above the art of their
brows and just the whole shebang so
today we're gonna do the whole ship I'm
gonna get a different brush than I
normally would today I'm going to use
the motives fan brush looks like this oh
yeah so this is the motives fan brush
and it is a little bit more dense and
thick than my morphe one so I just want
to try it out
oh boy haha it packs on the glow ho ho
hmm oh my god China can see this and I
live in Holland okay I see how can you
not see this I see you holy biscuits I'm
gonna highlight the tip of my nose and
my cupids bow just set everything and to
get rid of all the powder I'm going to
step my face using my makeup forever
mist and fix her lips of course we're
gonna go for those green iconic lips
that Rihanna were in her music video and
this is my color drain and this is in
the color IV and if you know me my dog
is called ivy so when I saw that this
lipstick was called Ivy I was like meant
to be meant to be see it noble lip liner
know anything just coloured raine ivy
and I do have a discount for you if you
want to save some dollars for a color
train use code Nicki one and you'll get
some dollars off alright ready for the
battle I've never worn green lips and
I'm kind of nervous
