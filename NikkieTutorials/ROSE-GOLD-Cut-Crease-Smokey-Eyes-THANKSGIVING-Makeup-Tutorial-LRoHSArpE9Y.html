look right here I wanted to create
something fierce glam just knocking
everyone out of the park for
Thanksgiving makeup look and this is
what I came up with
I created this duochrome pink Cup crease
like really fierce eye makeup look and
it played with a lot of new products for
this video today I'm and I must say I
really really like it I know I didn't
upload on Wednesday because I was sick I
I think I had the flu or something it
was a really really bad cold but I'm
back and better and I'm playing with the
Hooda Beauty rose gold palette today
I've heard a lot of things about this so
I'm gonna play with it today and see how
I like it so yeah if you would like to
know how to get this look for
Thanksgiving or for whenever you want to
slay your face and knock everyone out of
the part and rock everyone's socks off a
look if you want to know how to look
like that then keep on watching please
please please alright so since we want
to look glowing and moisturized and
beautiful for Thanksgiving
the first thing I'm gonna go in with is
Kim ties wonder lush in collaboration
with Oprah again this is a tester form
I've been with her through this process
since the beginning so um this is not
the final four it's not its final form
but this moisturizer is just amazing it
leaves a glow it leaves you looking
beautifully taken care of it's just life
and more ah life all right now for
foundation I'm going to go into a new
product this is my la girl and this is
called the pro coverage HD long wear
illuminating foundation it looks a lot
like makeup forever I have the color
porcelain right here but they also came
out with a 1-1 la girl yes yes and yes
you are representing as ghosties out
there I love this I love this you can
lighten any foundation or concealer with
this I love that this is perfect what
it's so revolutionary thank you for
breaking the rules
thank you oh my god that coverage Oh God
Elle my girl I see you it has a lovely
dewy finish what it asked overage now if
only they could just follow their own
revolution every break of rules by doing
a white concealer as well that will
really make my day I will say though the
foundation remains very wet like do you
see how it's almost wet like I have wet
skin like I'm sweating I'm not sure if
I'm the biggest fan of that I kind of
like it when it sets down and becomes a
little bit more dry this is still very
very wet for conceal are gonna go in
with the Kat Von D locket concealer
creams in l1 and l3 and I've heard that
these are a little bit more dry so I'm
trying to counteract the wetness of the
foundation with the dryness of the
concealer
let's see if this will make it a perfect
mixture of wet and dry
and now I'm going to set my under eye
area to prevent it from creasing
all right now I'm gonna set the rest of
my face using the Maybelline better skin
super-state powder in ten but my fear is
with really wet foundations when you set
it with powder it kind of moves the
foundation right before you said it
leaving it looking very disrupted and
like messy so my fear is that that will
happen so before I go in with my powder
just make sure that it's in parish and
ready to be set with powder you guys I'm
so sad I had such high hopes for this
foundation once I first applied it I got
so excited because it has beautiful
coverage but it just remains so wet all
right so the first thing I'm doing as
always is priming using my soft or group
Paint Pot by Mac
I'm not gonna go in with the Hooda
Beauty rose gold palette and going in
first with the color shy
we're just blending this into the crease
to build our definition and as a
transition color for all the depth and
darkness that will come in later and for
this look we're going to go all the way
into the inner crease and all the way
out now using the color bossy I'm going
to deepen and intensify that and again
taking this from inner to outer corner
natural really cut the crease we're
going to cut the lid by using Pro
Longwear concealer by Mac and with this
we're going to really clean up the lid
going right up against that crease color
to cut it
and I'm gonna set that all using angelic
now I'm going to blend and smoke out
that Cruz just a tad bit more using a
mix of bossy and man-eater alright now
I'm going to create a wing using my Tom
Ford eye defining pen in deeper from
there you want to create your basic wing
and filling in using my favorite Mac
liquid last liner in black
and now from that wing I'm going to
swoop one clean line into the cut crease
and now you want to softly buff black
above that line to give it a nice blend
for the lower lash I'm gonna go back in
with bossy and just smokin up that outer
lower lash line and then on the inner
corner and going back in with angelic
and as a transition right in between
going in with henna going into this
beautiful morphe highlighting palette
and taking the two pink shades to
highlight my inner corner all right all
we need not to finish off our lashes and
I'm going to go in with the any tude of
snobby lashes and for my lower lashes
I'm going to be using the Mac extended
play gigablack lash
all right eyes are done and looking
beautiful for Thanksgiving or whatever
your wanna okay so now we're gonna go
over to contouring oh I'm so obsessed
with this powder this is my Road aisle
and it's the instant glam compact Deluxe
contouring powder number three it is so
good I'm just gonna sink in those
cheekbones with this cuz honey it sticks
given we will be eating so we want to
carve those cheeks out to look spotted
and also doing my jaw line with this and
if you don't have a jaw line like I do
we're gonna create one actually quick my
realness
all right now for blush you're gonna go
for a nice mix of peach and pink this is
my Sigma they create one of my all-time
favorite blushes called the aura powders
this one is in the color Nymphaea and
I'm gonna use this new brush right here
it's a yellow gold handle these are
brand new morphe brushes they launched
on November 25th and this is the Y one
just that yellow gold here okay so we're
gonna blush up nothing too crazy because
the eyes are like pretty pretty intense
but you definitely do want a hint of
that niceness okay and then for
highlighter I am really really obsessing
over those two Pink's that is also
applied to the inner corners so I'm
going to apply those as my cheek
highlight so ina is another one of those
new brushes by morphe this is the why 14
and this is such a perfect highlighting
brush I'm going to go in with the
darkest one first to put some to put the
foundation down to put the to ground it
yes so I put that color down to get the
color of the pinkness really going but
then to blind it I'm gonna go in with
the lighter pink one just on the center
of my highlight portion to make it just
oh that's what I'm talking about
this in real life looks like magic like
it's beautiful on camera don't get me
wrong but in real life it's just a tap
it more intense of a pink so crazy cool
alright for lips I want to create a
really cool glossy metallic finish
so as the base I'm going to go in with a
beautiful nude this is by Maybelline and
this is in the color 5:30 hot sand
and then over time going to go in with a
product that has fascinated me for the
longest time
these are who is she cosmetics lip
hybrids and these are a mix of a gloss
long wearing stain / liquid lipstick I
can't even explain it it is so magical
if you follow them on Instagram a mind
blown and they make a lot of really cool
metallic colors so I want to go in with
this color right here it has a pink it
looks like the highlighter that I'm
wearing and that one is called mystic
st. and make it more metallic with the
color Sinclaire see how that is like a
rose gold metallic taking it hmm what oh
my god that is stunning love that color
uh and then right on the center I'm
gonna apply that rose gold metallic
called Sinclair what oh my god I want to
