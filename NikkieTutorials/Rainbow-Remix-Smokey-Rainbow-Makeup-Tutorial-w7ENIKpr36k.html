to see today I'm going to do a video on
sugarpill cosmetics of eyeshadows and
penguins and stuff and I'm also
featuring a Dutch website which is
called enchantra dot NL and they carry
nail polishes and they carry these
really handy dandy cool beats tattoos
which I'm wearing right now so I made a
look with a finally a smoky coloured
thing and now these B tattoos are so
cool but seriously they like glow oh my
god this is like the coolest thing for
even Halloween for my duchies for
Carnaval or I don't know where you want
to use murmur oh you see oh it is
freaking fantastic hope you guys like it
and if you want to know how I fit this
then please stay tuned
so the first thing I want to do is of
course apply a base I use my Michael
taught nude eyeshadow base which is this
one right here excuse than is then I'm
going to grab some NYX jumbo pencil in
milk and apply that to my lid and just
take my ring finger and blend it out
the first shadows you want to grab are a
black and this color right here by
sugarpill this is called and let's see
if this camera really is that good
this is poison plum oh my god can I get
I'm going to grab a black color now you
can use bulletproof by sugarpill that's
a matte deep black I have that but I'll
let it drop and then I throw it away and
then I set it on Twitter and then I was
like use it as a pigment but then it was
gone already
oh my grab any matte black you have just
take a teeny bit just like that onto
your brush and then go into poison plum
and go with the same brush go in that
too and then you have this like purpley
dark black color and that is the color
that is going on to your lid so Pat that
on can be even darker actually so just
put that on to the lid now want to brush
off and go into poison plum only and
right in the crease smudge that now this
color is called love plus by sugarpill
and it is a bride
dark or not really it's a bride true rat
color you guys were like she's gonna say
True Blood back into the and with a 226
by Sigma this is my favorite blending
brush I'm going to go into love Plus and
you want a teeny bit bit
this because these shadows are pigmented
as your mother's socks so I have some on
my brush and then I go into the crease
and just like you're gonna um go into
the crease and then go up now go too far
up because then you will look like a
clown as if you don't look like a clown
with this but you know what I mean and
just blend it up that was the 217 by Mac
I'm going to grab some poison plum and
some of that black color and I'm going
to go into the crease and extend it up
so now you're going to blend a darker
color with the love+
now I'm going to take dolly pop by
sugarpill and this is a bright bright
neon pink and with a 224 that we use to
blend those two colors together you're
just going to go into it like one or
twice okay twice is even too much so
you're going to just that off and then
go right here above the red and I'm
really almost not touching my skin
because then it will be way too
pigmented and it's working now I'm going
to grab some vanilla by Mac this is
going to be my base for my highlight
colors I'm going to grab a 275 by Sigma
and go into vanilla and go onto the brow
bone and just blend the color is done
I'm also going here to the inner corners
I'm lining up so just like that you can
go in here as well and blend it there to
take a butter cupcake by sugarpill this
is a bright bright bright canary yellow
I use this with my Harry Potter tutorial
as well I'm going to graph that 220 for
my Sigma and just take some and this is
going right here into the inner Croesus
what I would call it so right here and
that's going to make a nice rainbow
effect we all love rainbows don't we now
I'm going to grab Sol our white by Mac
and so our white is like you're just
like well so plane well it's a really
beautiful color it's like a gold Sheen
and I'm going to grab my 275 again and
this is going over the brow bone as well
for a gold Sheen this is gorgeous
let me tell you gorgeous over dark skin
colors because with that gold Sheen it's
really going to pop on darker colors for
Dale
we live we're having a lot of colors
going on I'm going to start off with my
214 brush by Sigma I'm going to go into
the poison plum the purple and the black
again and this is going on - let me get
my hand mirror and this is going on to
the outer corners and a little bit in go
into the poison plum - purple only hi
right there now I'm going to grab a sim
things in thin angled brush I'm going to
go into the black and the poison plum
and line all the way in like that and
now it's time to pop on some colors I'm
going to grab another sugar pill color
this is called um what the hell does it
say it's called after-party mm-hmm and
pop this onto the inner corners
then grab Midori Midori and that's a
green color also by sugarpill and with
that same brush but I just wiped it off
take that color and go under after party
so go right under it and then to make
that outer corner a little bit more
interesting I'm going to grab a 2:19 my
Mac or Sigma or anyone you like I'm
going to grab that red color this is a
love plus just a little bit and smoke
that below that black and purple color
and then wipe that out really really
well and then take your butter cupcake
again go into that and go under it and
butter cupcake can be smudged all the
way out to here now for the last step
this is actually my favorite step of
this entire look I'm gonna grab this
pigment called lumi by sugarpill and let
me tell you this about lumi lumi it's
just like teal shiny blue a sheen shine
and um the great thing is I use this
almost every day on my normal makeup
routine lumi if you apply luni wet to
your inner corners no matter with what
look you're wearing you will have a
grade inner high light that shines blue
teal green it's amazing I will do a look
soon with it for a normal makeup with
that on the inner corners it is amazing
so if I could recommend one single thing
from the entire sugarpill site I would
get lu me because this is my fave I'm
gonna grab some eye drops
and I'm going to make the brush kind of
wet not completely just a little bit
damn
and then I'm going to go into illumi my
favorite color and then just take some
and apply this to the inner corners and
here as well so just inner corners and a
little bit up and then you're done
add bead tattoos so the cone add
professional bead tattoos and they come
in things like this and they have
different designs and um I am going to
use these for today
so this is a bee tattoo and then you
just apply this they're self-adhesive so
you're just gonna pinch them on and then
it stays on oh my god don't you think
that that is like seriously uh it's like
the coolest thing ever oh my god I love
this and then they have like little dots
as well so I'm gonna grab like some dots
and just place them wherever I want them
so that is what I apply to that side and
there we have that side so the only
thing left is lips and you can see it
coming from me with all of this going on
you don't want a lot a lot going on to
your lips in my opinion so that
completes this um really early Halloween
Carnival
I don't know I'm playing with color I'm
playing with sugar pill and B tattoos
look um something about enchantra they
carry nail polishes as well this is I
just wanted to show you this one because
this is my favorite that I got this is
China glazes Atlantis and it is a green
teal color with 3d glitter oh my god I
hope you guys like this tutorial if you

what
chewing and I'm going to wrap it up
because this is way too long I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
