stupid didn't do my first tutorial for
fashion it's that now let me explain to
you what these tutorials are there is a
new magazine in the Netherlands and I am
their like beauty video columnist and
it's so freaking cool that they asked me
to do this so from now on every two
weeks I will post a fishiness that
tutorial and in these tutorials I kinda
make a look inspired by that months like
theme of fishiness that it's really cool
that they asked me to do is I'm so
freakin honored like so in the
fashionista tutorials I won't be able to
tell you any brands but I do show you
some swatches and then you can get
something that is close to what you have
also go check out fishing ISTA where if
you can buy it so today I decided to do
a fifty sort of look and this is mainly
inspired by Rebecca from The Vampire
Diaries I have been got smacked killed
with all the requests for it I got so
many requests to do a Rebecca from The
Vampire Diaries
like was it 20s or 50s I don't know like
a really old look I absolutely love it
it it reminds me of Marilyn Monroe and I
tried to do some finger waving which
absolutely failed but I don't care so if
you want to know how I did this look
then please keep on watching okay the
first thing we're gonna do is I'm gonna
take a penguin that is just like your
skin but just a little bit more shimmery
I'm gonna take a big one that is a sort
of like this color say if you have
anything like this in your collection go
ahead and grab it and I'm just gonna
apply that onto my lid and onto the
inner corners of my eye then we're gonna
take a white eyeshadow like this and I'm
going to pop that on to the inner
corners of my eyes to really open them
up
I'll get that for the crease I'm going
to take a really nice gray taupe color
and a really nice mid brown color and
I'm going to mix the two together and
then just apply those into the outer
corners of your crease so right here is
where you want to apply them and then
take us close again and go down onto
your lid and blend it in let's take a
blending brush and take that big brown
again and blend it out of it and then
I'm going to take a really big blending
brush and make it softer what I'm not
going to do is take a gel eyeliner there
are a lot of companies who do them and
I'm just gonna take a really small nail
art brush but I'm gonna use it for
eyeliner and then I'm just going to do
that Lauren Conrad eyeliner but that is
also really really nice for this Rebecca
look just a really really small thin
line and then wing it out
and then from like the middle of that
wing we just made go back in
and then fill it in and do your thing
and they connect the two parts
I'm not gonna curl my lashes with my
eyelash curler and apply some mascara
and then I'm also going to add some
false lashes to really give the eyes
that really like elegant feeling and the
lashes I'm going to use it look like
that just really long and pretty and Wow
okay friend of lipstick I already
blanked out the lips completely so you
really can make the red pop the red
lipstick I'm using is a really really
nice bright red just take the brightest
red lipstick that you have I'm going to
take this color right here
and that completes this Marilyn Monroe
Rebecca from The Vampire Diaries like
fifties inspired makeup on this tutorial
most exclusive for fishing this stuff so
yeah go check out the new magazine that
I mean it's so freakin cool that I'm
actually in a magazine if you live in an
island go take a look at it because I'm
in it
so thinking is so much for watching I
love you and hopefully I would see you
guys next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
