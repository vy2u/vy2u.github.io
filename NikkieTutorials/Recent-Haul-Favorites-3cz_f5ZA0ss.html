haul for you guys and it's not just all
it's kind of a collective haul I bought

bought from all the haulage that I did
but before we start I want to thank each

thousand subscribers that is insane to
me that is unbelie-- and I don't know
what to say it is thank you so much
thank you so the first thing I want to
talk about is jewel mint and it's kind
of like up-and-coming in youtubeland
where you have jewel min and everyone's
doing videos about it I ordered some
things from jewel women um and since I
got this I've been wearing them for like
every single day
jewel mint is a style icon Kate Bosworth

turn bring you designer jewellery

basically on the website of jewel make
you you have a little quiz and you just
you like choose your answers and then at
the end you can sign up for free and
then they match jewelry items to your
stuff a couple of weeks ago I got a
couple of things and number one is this
amazing necklace I've been wearing it so
much for so long since I got it to me it
looks a really really fin tidge then
another really neat thing and I talked
about this on Twitter is earrings alike
that you put this piece you put that
piece in your ear and then this little
bondage thingy that we have right here
goes right there and the
have a earring like that and every time
I wear people are going crazy on the
earring and then another favorite that I
got is this ring and I don't know why
but it reminds me of Pirates of the
Caribbean
a lot it's like this I don't know it
reminds me of pirates so that's it from
gentlemen that are my favorite items
that I got and on to makeup so I went to
Mac a couple of weeks ago and I splurged
I have a discount card from that which
is 40%
and so I splurged I'm gonna show you
like for items that are my favorites
from the entire lot that I bought the
first one is the strobe cream from Mac
as you know I love my cream highlighters
I loved you with skin so I got the
strobe cream and the strobe cream is
really neat it has like do you know that
foundation that Mac used to have it's
called hyper real and it had this pink
sheen with the got discontinued of
course because they always discontinued
good stuff but with the stroke cream
that is the same like pinky sheen you
probably can see it but the strobe cream
is the same pink Sheen that that fine a
shin has so if I want this like hyper
regal foundation ish like finish I think
my stroke cream mix it with my
foundation I'll put it put it on before
I do my foundation I love strobe cream
then also big favorite is Black Tide I
shadow from Meg it's like carbon but
with lots and lots of glitter in it
absolutely adore it
now also got this eyeliner pencil
eyeliner from MEC which is called auto
auto to blue the outer and it's a
eyeliner like that and it's really
pretty in blue look is really neat I
love it so the next thing I'm going to
show you is Illamasqua and Illamasqua
has been growing on you like no other I
ordered some of their eye pencils a
couple of weeks ago and I used to
some shoots that idea of photo shoots
and I absolutely fell in love so I
splurged because I have a 40% discount
at LMS Caswell I splurged and I ordered
almost all of their eye pencils is this
right keep all my many pencils and look
like half of it is illamasqua some of my
favorites are your called a bow which is
a really nude another favorite is coax
which is a light like blue eye pencil I
have never seen a light like baby blue
and then Brant it's amazing
Sophie which is amazing black it's I
used that on the photo shoot I can't
show you the pictures dad because we
have to keep it a secret I use Sophie
and we make this like grungy
black eye it was amazing I did all of it
with Sophie and some black eye shadow
it's amazing a neon orange pencil this
is called trash I've never seen a
company company do that amazing another
favorite from Illamasqua is the sealing
gel and the sealing channel is like a
mixing medium but it really turns
anything into skin glue it basically
turns everything into a waterproof
liquid so I use some eye shadow and I
mix it with this and applied it as
eyeliner it stayed on the entire day
another favorite of Illamasqua is on
your eye shadow look at that look I
don't and then the last thing that I
really love is just very m100 color it's
called baby pink I'm wearing it all
right now I'm obsessed with this all
I've been wearing it for like days weeks
the necklace is from jewel men amazing
uh the earring amazing the strobe cream

did for you I just wanted to show you my
favorites from the last couple of weeks
