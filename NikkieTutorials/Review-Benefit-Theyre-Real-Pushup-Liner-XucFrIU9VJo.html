benefit and they're real push-up liner
I got flown over to San Francisco two
months ago they flew me over and there
was a 3-day PR public relations event
where we could really get to know this
product a lot more so with this we found
we met five artists including Lisa
Eldridge so that was absolutely amazing
and I loved the trip I loved everything
that the benefit team organized for us
and it was the best PR event I have ever
been to like they took care of us so
well and the event was amazing so on day
three they revealed to us that they were
going to launch a new product called
their real push-up liner that this is
additional to the their real mascara so
these two are sort of the winning combo
in benefit size I've gotten a lot of
time to test this products out really
well because I got this in San Francisco
two months ago and it only got released
to a couple of PR people a couple of
weeks ago so I really have time to work
with it and try it out and I think today
is the perfect time to tell you all
about my experiences with it how I like
it do I like it
do I recommend it what are the pros and
what are the cons I'm going to talk all
about it today in this review so this is
what the product looks like up close and
it just has benefits they're real
push-up liner written on top and then we
just have all these kind of jigs and
then this is the lid you screw it off
and then here is where the magic happens
it does have an orange stopper now Lisa
Eldridge told me to put this in every
single time you've used it or else the
product will dry out eventually and I'm
kind of sticking to that because when
Lisa tells you something in real life
you follow that so this is what the tip
looks like and it has that really nice
sort of round edge here and then the
sharp sort of slanted eyeliner point you
get product out by twisting it and what
I found is that twisting it two times is
more than enough one twist doesn't give
enough product but two just gives you
right amount to get you started with
I've also noticed that once you've
clicked it up two times you have to work
from it straightly onto your
it's not like a gel eyeliner that you
first debit on the back of your hand a
little bit no you twist it two times and
go straight to your eyes because I found
that if you do not go to your eyes you
kind of don't have enough product to
work with and it tends to sort of smudge
and look uneven so what I'm going to do
is I'm going to twist two times one two
and then wait a little for products to
burst up so with the derry-o what I like
to do is start by placing it in between
the roots of my lashes you can tell I've
waited too long applying this straight
to the eye so it's already dry this is a
product you have to work with very
quickly try that again so I'm just
starting by placing that close to the
roots of my lashes and getting a nice
even black line there I'm going to make
my wing and this is fairly easy because
you just have to place it onto the skin
and kind of drag it out of it and then
you will have your wing there in just
seconds it's also really nice about this
tip so you can really easily with that
sharp point take it to the inner corner
and fill in okay so this is what we have
going so far I'm just going to take
another click and then try to finish it
all off towards the inner corner I'm
really working that into the roots of
the lashes I find it quite hard to get a
nice solid sharp line because the
product dries quite quickly you have to
work with it so fast that if you're not
fast enough you get these little dry
bumps and it's just not smooth and just
it's not gliding on so after working
with the product for about five minutes
this is what I'm left with it is
definitely a really nice cat eye line
but if you look closely you can see that
somewhere it's more opaque than other
places and along the edge of the line
it's really bumpy and dry looking
so this is what the liner looks like
after playing with it a little bit more
after giving a couple of more chances I
do see that tugging the eye helps to get
it a little bit more smoother but then
in the long run causes wrinkles so don't
feel really comfortable doing that
technique it is better than we started
with it it's a lot smoother right now
and it is black but I do feel that it's
not even coverage everywhere we do miss
a couple of spots of pure blackness it's
not as smooth I kind of miss that ooh so
that is a little look at how it applies
now if you're wondering how did you get
it to smooth after all I went over it
with a liquid liner I went to San
Francisco and I saw this product for the
first time and I knew it was going to be
huge because I know this is going to get
hyped so much but I feel like it's not
the perfect product for application on
yourself
I do find this to be amazing on others
for models clients as long as you are
applying it on someone else this is
amazing at least for me as a makeup
artist there's a certain way of holding
my models eyes when doing eyeliner and
holding my own eyes for when doing
eyeliner so that is sort of the
difference for me so if you ask me is it
the easiest liner to work with on
yourself this would be a no because you
could just see that the edges are not
totally sharp and smooth and I kind of
missed that opaque even coverage but for
some reason this works like magic on
models clients you can work it in so
amazingly precise in between the lashes
you make a thick cat wing with it you
can go dramatic with it it's it's it's
really hard for me to say that you have
to get it for yourself because I use it
on my models only and not really on
myself so that is basically the only con
I have about this one all the rest of it
is positive this stays on like a rock
you can wear this to the pool you can
wear this to the beach you can wear this
in the rain you can wear this everywhere
because it stays on like a mother once
it's on is not going anywhere I also
like putting this on as my base on my
and then just the same as I did today I
put this on as a base and I take my
Catrice liquid liner in dating Joe black
which is my all-time favorite right now
and I go over it to smooth out and
sharpen out the edges but that is not
what you wish for in an eyeliner to buy
an additional eyeliner to make it work
better that's not how it works
however if you do do that it's awesome
because that's what I'm wearing today
and I know this is gonna last like a
rock now because this stays on so well
then if it also created a their real
remover because this is a bitch to get
off let me tell you that you will not
get it up with a makeup wipe you will
not get it up with cleansing milk you
need either the beef a sort of the the
blue and the oil sort of if you have to
mix it in between that sub works like
magic or you have to use the their real
remover what I like to do is put some of
the they're real remover onto my makeup
wipe this is what we're starting with so
you know and then start making movements
but as you can see this bitch makes a
mess like the more you work it in the
gray or you'll become that's a little
downside to with that once you take it
off and once you have to take it off it
will be a little bit of a mess you will
look like a raccoon a drunk for Coon so
yeah in a nutshell it's a great product
it is really really really long-lasting
I love the design I love that they came
up with that accuflex tip it's a really
awesome tip d cons however is that it's
kind of hard to get a nice sharp edge of
your line um it's it's kind of hard to
get even coverage everywhere because the
product and of lumps up in places and
then doesn't apply in other places so
it's kind of hard to get it opaque and
even I also wish that benefit gave us a
little bit more time to work with the
products I give you 30 seconds and this
is dry this bad boy retails for $24 and
will be available at Sephora and any
other places where benefit is available
and it will be part of the permanent
line so that's it I hope you enjoyed for
