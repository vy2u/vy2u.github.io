May and her new single is coming out in
February and to celebrate that I am
doing a lady Gaga inspired makeup look
and I got inspired by the Grammys where
she wore the pink like Illuminati thing
around her eye and then I went to got
her daily and um I saw a picture of her
at a concert with fans posing and she
had one eye with this in gold and one
normal eye and I fell in love with the
picture the problem is I don't have gold
rhinestone so I made it silver and yeah
we're just acting crazy with the wig and
stuff this is appropriate for Halloween
and carnival as well if you hate wigs
you can just take the wig off and then
you're bald you can just rock your
normal hair and be Gaga five so if you
want to know how to get this diamond -
I'm ask then please keep watching
the first thing you want to do is apply
a eyeprimer cheer let's prevent your
eyes from creasing and I use my BH
Cosmetics eyelid primer the first color
we're going to use is this piece of our
pallet that I used in my kitchen video
as well and we're going to take the
color right there so next to the white
I'm going to take a MEK 252 and I'm
going to take that color and apply that
to my lids I'm going to grab a sigma 224
and I'm going to go into this color
right here so to color under the white
we're gonna use the crease trick that
lady I always use this she starts out at
the outer corner then goes over her
crease and goes under her eyebrow so
start at the outer corner go all the way
over your crease and go like that and
Lady Gaga uses this technique a lot and
we all know why because I told it in
other videos as well by going further
into your nose line your nose will look
smaller now I'm going to take Ben Nyes
Lumiere pigment in LX one ice and this
is going on to our brow bone to
highlight now for the lower lash line I
use that same color that we use in the
crease on the other eye I have this
silver glitter and the silver glitter is
by makeup studio and it's called jewel
effects in shine I'm not going to apply
that to this eye because this is
completely getting covered with all the
rhinestones and I don't want it to be
like a silver overkill so I thought it
would be fun to give the other eye some
silver glitter on the inner corners and
then just decide the eye mask but if you
want to know how I applied this glitter
I took some two way gel from makeup
studio and I applied that too
the parts where I want the glitter and
then the glitter on top and this glitter
is available at my mom's web shop and I
did my mom's makeup yesterday with this
as well and I loved it so now it's time
for eyeliner and Lady Gaga has a matte
eyeliner so we're going to take a max
black check fluid line with a sigma and
you are called a Sigma e65 small angle
brush
once you have that killer Lady Gaga
eyeliner on grab some concealer and a
concealer brush and make them only
really sharp underneath now it's time
for some white eyeliner I'm going to get
mix pure white chroma graphic pencil and
of course my favorite trick is to take a
lighter and make it warm so it stays on
your lid all day okay now it's time to
curl the lashes with your favorite
eyelash curler and I'm going to use to
scare us this is makeup studios of
maximum volume and on top the luminous
carbon light by L'Oreal and now it's
time for my favorite part and I've been
waiting to do this for like always I
don't have gold rhinestones but I do
have silver so I am going to make the
the luck eye mask silver but you can do
it in pink red gold rights to blue
anything gonna pop some eyelash glue on
my desk okay so we're just gonna do it a
tweezer men's I take a right zone I put
it in the eyelash glue and then put it
on
keep on going and this is something it
should look like once you're done that's
really good otters we know that Lady
gaga um loves new lips but she wants
them a couple of tones darker than our
own skin tone and we're going to do that
today and I'm gonna grab my Smashbox um
lip pencil in pro pro and what you
basically want to do is just the line
your lips and fade it a little bit
inwards and once you've done that you
have those Gaga nudes lined precious
lips and once you have your Gaga wig on
and your Gaga gloves you're ready to
rumble so that completes this Lady Gaga
Grammys with a fan inspired makeup look
and this is especially for her new album
that is coming up in May
I guess born this way so thank you guys
so much for watching I love you and um
