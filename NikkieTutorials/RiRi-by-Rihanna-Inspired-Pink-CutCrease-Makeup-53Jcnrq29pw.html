inspired by Rihanna and Rihanna came out
with a new perfume called RiRi and lots
of you guys actually send me tweets or
Instagram messages or Facebook messages
asking me to do a tutorial inspired by
this lovely pink cut crease makeup so I
took inspiration from those ads and
created this pink cut crease winged
liner romantic fierce Chloe skin makeup
look I must say I really enjoyed doing
this look so if you want to know how to
get this look right here then please
keep on watching so the first thing I'll
be doing today is priming my face using
my Nivea man aftershave balm in
sensitive this contains glycerin and
glycerin makes products stick to it so
once you apply this to your face all the
makeup that you put over top will
actually stick on to that glycerin all
day long and then I follow through using
my Smashbox primer water abusing the
hourglass fill fluid foundation in
porcelain and mixing that with Born This
Way ivory by Too Faced and I'm working
this mixture in with a Beauty Blender
for concealer I'll be using my naked
skin concealer by urban decay in fair
neutral and I'll be working this in with
a real techniques sponge
and quickly setting it with powder to
prevent it from creasing before eyes the
first thing I'm going to do is prime
them of quartz using my Mac soft ochre
Paint Pot to start off our cut crease
I'm taking this a warm mid brown color
from the jaclyn hill morphe palette and
with a morphe and 506 i'm starting off
by cutting my crease and i like to go a
little bit higher than my natural
creases just follow the shape I love
this morphe brush for a soft cut crease
this because it just really defines that
line of the crease but still keeps it
soft to blend that out I'm taking the
morphe m5 14 and the same eyeshadow
color I'm just blending it out softly
now taking a warm chocolate color and
the same more feet M 506 and just
defining that Cup crease even more for
the lid I'm going to take this morphe
35n bright pink color and mixing it with
this one from the Jaclyn hill favourites
morphe palette a little bit and using my
Mac 242 I'm applying this onto the lid
and also cutting that crease even more
for the lower lash I know taking natural
beauty and best friend
from the tartlet from the tart tart foot
pellets and with a Mac 228 i'm just
buffing this in and to highlight the
inner corners i'm taking this nyx
prismatic eyeshadow in girl-talk and i'm
applying that using a morphe 36 for my
winged liner and first using my Kathleen
D tattoo liner in trooper just to
outline the shape and then filling in
using my NYC black liquid liner to
finish out via course hate some falsies
so the full C's of using are by house of
lashes and these are called boudoir and
for my lower lashes i'm using the mac
upward lash upward black mascara okay
for cheeks the first thing i'm going to
do is warm up my complexion because I
want to look warm and bronzy so for this
I'm taking the Tarte Park F Princess
contour set and I'm taking this this for
blush I'm going to use this girl lab
blush in over rose and I'm going to
swirl the two together
Ariana's blush was focused mainly on the
outer sides of her face so instead of
going on to the apples of the cheeks you
just want to follow along with that
bronzer you just applied
and then to highlight a first going in
with that Knicks prismatic eyeshadow in
Girl Talk and just a tiny bit of that
will go on the highest points of my face
and then blending the edges by going
back in with that blush brush which she
just applied your blush with and they'll
beautifully blend the edges back into
nonets nests for lips it's super easy
because Rihanna didn't really wear a
really bold in-your-face crisp lip it
was more so a fun playful pink color
really naturally blotted in and not
applied really crisp and clean so for
this at first going in with my dose of
colors love potion lipstick and apply to
the center first smear lips together and
then what's your finger start working
that in and then for a little bit of
gloss over top I'm going to use these
Sigma tender lip gloss like this and
