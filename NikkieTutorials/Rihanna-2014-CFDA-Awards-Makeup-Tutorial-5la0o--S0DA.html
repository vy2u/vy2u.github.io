tutorial on Rihanna's look at the 2014
CFD 8 Awards I know everyone and their
mother has done a tutorial on this here
on YouTube but I just when I saw the
pictures
of course my eyes first went to dem
boobs and dead-ass in all honesty I say
when you got it flaunt it I absolutely
loved haryana looked because I mean if I
had that body but not only was everyone
talking about her dress everyone was
also talking about her makeup because
that was a drop-dead gorgeous she was
wearing these super sultry sort of topi
purpley greyish silverish eyes smoky
eyes and as soon as I saw the makeup I
was like ok tutorial so if you want to
know how to get this look then please
keep on watching so the first part I'll
be using is by Mac prep and prime and
this is the natural radiance in radiant
yellow hence the yellow dot and I'm just
going to put this all over my face for
the foundation I'm again going to make a
mixture with my L'Oreal True Match in n1
and that Mac select cover up concealer
in nw15 I am really liking what this
does to my face it makes it so flawless
so I'm going to mix these two together
and apply that to my face using my
makeup geek Foundation stippling brush
and I'm just dabbing that onto my skin
and then really buffing it in and I just
love how absolutely flawless this makes
my skin look ok right on to concealer
for this I will be using my Mac Pro
Longwear concealer in NC 15 and to
further highlight and bring out features
in my face I'll be using my Mac prep and
prime a highlighter in radiant rose
looks like that and as always the Mac
Pro Longwear I am applying in this sort
of Halfmoon shape because I find that
the UM sort of Kim Kardashian triangle
doesn't really work for me prep them
prime
all righty and I'm going to blend that
in with my ring finger
I'm not going to set my under eye area
using my chanell natural lose finish
powder in Clair 20 i'm not quickly off
camera going to do my brows and for that
I'm going to use my Anastasia brow Wiz
in ash blonde and a couple of eyeshadows
and brow powders and if you want a
full-on tutorial on how I do my brows
you can actually check back to my last
video because that was an in-depth brow
tutorial updated property so if you want
to see how I do my brows then go watch
that video I will put the link in the
infobox below as well so gonna do my
brows right now and also go ahead and do
one eye and then I will be back for eyes
I already went ahead and applied a base
to my eyelids to prevent that I shadow
from creasing and I use my Mac soft
ochre Paint Pot for this because
Rihanna's eyes were surrounded by this
amazingly gorgeous soft warm brown color
I'm first gonna apply that all around my
eyes and the eyeshadow we'll be using
for this is makeup geeks creme brulee
and I'm going to start applying creme
Brule right above my crease and softly
blending it up I'm also going to blend
this right here on the bottom lashline
because the look was so soft and Smokey
and hazy it's totally fine to go as down
as far down as you want now it's time to
build some definition in the outer V and
crease and I'm starting off with this
palette from softbox this is the a tude
palette and I'm going to take this color
red here and with this I'm going to
start building definition in my outer
part of my crease blending inwards and
not going up super high yet I also
definitely want to blend this down onto
the lid and kind of just start building
your definition here I'm going to blend
it slightly with the creme brulee by
makeup geek and a little bit further in
but nothing way too much before I
continue I quickly want to highlight my
entire eye and going back into my
softbox a tude palette and I'm taking
this color right here and with this I'm
highlighting my brow bone and blending
it with creme brulee my makeup geek and
while I'm at it I'm also going to touch
my inner corners here from that same
palette again I'm going to go into the
black and I'm going to start building
this up at the outer V so I'm just going
to start dusting some of that black in
but keeping it mainly tail halfway of my
eyes don't go any further in and then
with the same black I'm going to run it
along my lower lash line and really work
it in there you want this to be soft
smoky and hazy and then once you're at
the bottom you can flick it up to meet
with the crease and that will kind of
get your shape going for my lid color
I'll be taking another makeup geek
shadow and this is the one we'll be
using and this is prom night I'm just
going to Pat this all over the remaining
part of my lids that hasn't got any
shadow on it yet and I'm also blending
this up to meet in the curry so give it
a little bit more sparkle and pizzazz
I'm gonna take a pressed pigment by Mac
and this is called jet Couture and I'm
picking some of that up with my finger
and Pat it on top of my lid but I find
this to be a little bit too harsh and
dark so I'm going back in with my prom
night and I'm really lightly patting
that on top so I still get that glitter
and shimmer Sparkle from jet Couture but
I get the color from prom night I'm just
relaying some of the black on my outer V
and crease just to grab the look a
little bit more and also going back in
with a little bit of creme brulee and
reapplying there where it's a little bit
too sheer I am going in with an essence
long-lasting eye pencil and this is
black favourite this is a great job for
any long-lasting waterproof eyeliner for
on your waterline it's a great one what
I'll be doing with this is reaming this
along my entire lash line area so this
is really hard to do on camera
so I'm going to put it on my waterline
and I'm going all the way to the inner
corners now with a little tiny brush I'm
going to take prom night again and put
this on the very inner part of the lower
lash line I'm going to take more of that
black shadow and I'm going to place it
very closely to the roots of my lashes
sort of as an eyeliner but on this outer
part here I'm going to apply a little
bit more I'm going to try to make it
look as if the black comes from that
outer V and then goes all the way to the
inner corner as an eyeliner so really
pack on the black on this outer corner
here and then from there sort of line
your upper lash line to highlight my
inner corners I'm going to take another
softbox palette
this is creme de la creme I'm going to
use these two highlighting shades right
here and just highlighting my inner
corners with this it will really help
opening up your eyes with a smoky eye
this trick right here okay so now it's
time for mascara and lashes and for
mascara I'll be using my what approved
3d extra black mascara by makeup studio
and for my bottom lashes I'm gonna take
the Mac extended play gigablack lash and
for my falsies I'll be using these by XO
beauty
Shen's EXO's brand and these are the
feline and I am over these so for cheeks
I notice that Rihanna wasn't really
wearing a sort of typical pinky light
blush so we're only gonna sculpt and
bronze &amp;amp; Glow a little bit but that's it
we don't want anything else so let's get
cracking I am going to contour using my
Illamasqua eyeshadow in heroine just
like opens oh you just wanna you know
sinking in those cheeks a little bit no
damn girl oh no na there are the cheeks
oh no no sink in I think in a nutshell I
spent half of my life contouring let's a
give us a really warm bronzy haze I'm
gonna go into my you guessed it
illamasqua disobey
watch dropping washes brushes and I'm
just gonna warm my cheeks up a bit
Rihanna was only wearing bronzer and
warmth and of course like what the hell
am i doing and then to give myself that
beautiful glow I'm gonna go back into my
sauce box creme de la creme palette and
I'm just slightly and lightly gonna take
this color right here just a little tiny
bit and highlight oh my god that is oh
god that's gorgeous Jesus I'm even going
to sort of dust it under my eyes because
I've noticed that a lot of celebrities
on the red carpet nowadays highlight the
under eyes with the shimmery color like
crazy that's different cheeks okay okay
so we've got these amazing eyes and
cheeks and skin done now it's time for
lips there was a very obvious lip line
going on with Rihanna so I'm first going
to line my lips using my Lancome LeConte
or beige rose pencil then for lipstick
I'm going to take this color by Chanel
and this is a heady use and to give
myself that really beloved to us look
that Rihanna has as well I'm just going
to take a lighter concealer and tap that
in Moodle and then for lip gloss I'm
going to take the NYX butter gloss in
fortune cookie and that guys concludes
