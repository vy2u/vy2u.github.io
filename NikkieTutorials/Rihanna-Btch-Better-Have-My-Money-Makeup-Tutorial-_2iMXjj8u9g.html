on this makeup look right here this is
inspired by Rihanna's new music video
bitch better have my money I love this
music video because Rihanna is just
batshit crazy in it and I love that so I
decided to recreate the look where she
is about to cut murder the man she grabs
his knife looks at it all fiercely and
then she's about to cut someone so that
is the look that I'm doing plus I'm also
collaborating with an XO Shannon here on
YouTube and she is recreating the look R
ariana is wearing the purple blue lips
and the eyeliner that scene cuts by
really fast but the look is gorgeous
they definitely don't forget to check
out Shannon's video I'll put the link
down below and you can click here in the
screen and it will take you to her video
show her love go comment tell her I sent
you and just share the love so without
any further ado if you would like to
know how to get this Rihanna bitch
better have my money
make a book then keep on watching
alright so the first thing I'll be doing
is priming my face so that my face stays
intact all day long and for this I'm
using my Nivea men aftershave balm
insensitive now if you're new to my
channel you're like what so this
aftershave balm contains a lot of
glycerin and glycerin makes products
stick to it so if you apply this as your
base the glycerin in this will keep your
makeup on all day and after working it
in for a while you will feel it becoming
tacky and then it's what you want
after that I like to follow through with
my Smashbox primer water for foundation
I'm using this Cogan duo aqua foundation
in 213 and mixing it a little bit with
the Kogan doe moisture foundation in
0:12 and to apply it I'm using my morphe
e6 brush you want to apply this in a
nice stippling motion
for concealer I use the Urban Decay
Naked skin concealer in fair neutral and
first just underneath my eyes and then
go crazy and applied wherever you think
you need it war paint and then with my
Real Techniques sponge and blending that
in then setting it with powder to
prevent it from creasing the first thing
I'll be doing is applying a base to my
lid to prevent everything from creasing
and for this I'm using my Mac soft ochre
Paint Pot and I'm using a zoeva
concealer buffer brush for this
the first eyeshadow going to go in with
is by uh Nastasia Beverly Hills and this
called orange soda and this color will
act as our transition for in our crease
and i'm using a morphe M 504 for this as
the main color I'll be using love+ by
sugarpill and with a morphe M 513 I'm
just applying that to the crease
and I'm barely touching my skin with the
brush and because of that you will get a
really nice blend on its own of course
it will need some more blending later on
but but just slightly touching the skin
it will do most of the work for you then
here on the outer corner you want to
wing it out a little bit then you can
always go back in with the orange soda
and diffuse the edges
I'm also concentrating the red on the
outer portion of my lid now for the lid
I'm going to use Mac's new dazzle shadow
in let's roll
because these shadows are kind of hard
to work with as a base I'm going to use
a glitter glue this is my lid and this
is the clearly liquid glitter base I'm
going to use this as a base of the
shadow over top and that will really
make it pop
I with the tiniest bit of a nostalgia
Beverly Hills rich velvet I'm just
darkening the corners and the crease
for the lower lashline I'm first
applying love+ the sugar pill again and
this time with a Mac 228 then with a Mac
213 I'm softly blending the edges then
with rich velvet and the morphe M 508
I'm just darkening the roots of my lower
lashes to highlight the inner corners
I'm taking to makeup geek foiled
eyeshadows this is whimsical and where
am I in the spotlight now with a little
bit of black eyeshadow at the morphe g28
I'm just darkening the roots of my top
lashes on the waterline I'm applying
this hourglass one-point-five mechanical
gel liner in obsidian just to you know
get that smoky effect going all you want
to do now is finish off with mascara on
top and bottom lashes and some falsies
and the falsies I'll be using today are
by Lena lashes and these are called
Bianca and if you use code
nikkietutorials at checkout you will get
50% off to warm up my face and first
going in with this Mac bronzer in give
me Sun and just start bronzing up your
complexion to contour I'm using heroine
eyes shadow by Illamasqua and for this
amusing a zoeva 105 luxe highlight brush
for blush your going to use this blush
by Gerlach called golden hi but mainly
this terracotta terracotta e color here
and to highlight of course mary-lou
manizer by the balm because rihanna
looked super super glowy and dewy and
that is exactly what we can create with
Marylou
so my highlighting brush today is by
morphe and this is the M 501 I'm not
sponsored or whatever with more feet I
just got in a lot of new brushes buy
them today and I am trying them out and
so far I am loving them for lips I'm
first going in with Mac lip pencil in
current
and then to fill in I'm going to use
this color pop ultra matte liquid
lipstick or ultra matte lip gloss and
this is in the color LAX
and that guy's concludes my Rihanna fish
