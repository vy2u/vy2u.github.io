on Rihanna's signature look ever since
she got a blondie and also her
performance on the Grammys it's the same
look I love the Grammys and I love
Rihanna when I hear her accent oh my god
talk talk more speak say more do it so
if you want to know how to get Rihanna's
Grammy performance slash ever since she
got a blondie look then please keep on
watching watching so if you want to know
how I got this look then please keep on
watching
so as always I'm going to start off with
Mac's Paint Pot in soft ochre and I'm
going to apply them as a base to my
eyelids the first color going to use is
cross-cultural by Mac and I'm going to
start off by applying this onto my lid
close to the lash line
none of the tick makes coorg eyeshadow
and I'm going to blend that above
cross-cultural going down into the
cross-cultural because you want to give
it that feeling from going to a darker
color to a lighter color there isn't a
lot of crease work in this it's just a
really nice gradient up now I'm going to
take this the Donnelly's blending brush
and blend cork up
now I'm going to take this mech pikmin
in naked deep dark which is a really
nice warm skin tone color and I'm going
to apply that on to the lid to really
make it a nice shimmery soft smoky look
now I'm going to take max chamomile and
Dez alight and I'm going to mix the two
and apply those as a inner corner
highlight now for the water line I'm
going to take Urban Decay 24/7 glide-on
eye pencil and I'm just going to put
that onto my waterline and tightline as
well I'm going to make a really teeny
wing on the top just to make the
eyelashes look fuller basically and then
I'm gonna take max mystery
blend that out to make it softer
I'm also going to put some mystery on
the bottom lashes as well to smoke it
out a bit
okay now that applied the Urban Decay
eye liner once more just to really make
it black okay so once you've done that
it's time for mascara and the one I'm
going to use is really lengthening and
volumizing the one I'm using is makeup
sitios waterproof 3d extra black mascara
I talked about this in my haul of
January it's amazing it's the bomb and
for my bottom lashes I'm going to use
makeup studio mascara in false lash
effect for D extra black
so per lips I'm going to use one of the
most gorgeous lipsticks Mac has ever
made this is Prince Noir and it is a met
dark event B red I love Prince nor
Prince noir is going all over the lip up
we're going to do that today
so this is the top lift not just do the
bottom and make it even so that
completes this Rihanna signature dark
edgy look since she got her blonde hair
and her Grammy performance look so I
really like this it's so edgy it's so
different I love it with light blonde
hair I love it with all skin colors and
stuff so yeah I like this I hope you
