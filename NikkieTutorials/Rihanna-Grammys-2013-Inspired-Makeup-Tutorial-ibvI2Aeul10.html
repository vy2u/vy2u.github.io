look inspired by Rihanna's at 2013
Grammys look and I absolutely loved her
look like she had three different
dresses and I loved every dress and I
loved everything about her I I was
watching it with my wife with my
boyfriend again I'm sorry I should stop
the bragging I'm sorry so we watch the
Grammys together and basically whenever
Rihanna came on I was all about gosh
I'm a lesbian for now I'm sorry I need
so today I decided to recreate that look
and before we start I of course want to
tell you I said I do not look like her
at all
I mean not at all so yeah if you want to
know how to get the 2013 Rihanna's
Grammys look then please keep on
watching I know I'm done
so it's always the first thing you want
to do is apply major eyelid super
compact sort of increasing and I am
using my neck soft ochre Paint Pot the
day that this will change will probably
never come oh let's make discontinues it
then we're going to kill them there's
people mad and then I'm going to take
this NYX slide on and glide on and
whatever on pencil in pure white and
we're gonna highlight the inner corners
of our eyes with this or I'm going to do
mine with this and then with a small
brush start blending that out and making
it look natural and soft so I'm going to
take texture eyeshadow by Mac and this
is the perfect sort of warm crease color
for this look I want this you softly
want to bring some definition into that
crease and then mostly focusing on the
outside and then working your way in but
not too much and now with the bigger
blending brush I'm going to take it by
neck as well and then make the entire
crease even softer it is really softly
then go all the way in so with your
texture you want to stay around the
outside of the crease and with kid you
can blend it all out and go all the way
in I'm going to take a bit of tech
sure again and run that along my lower
lash line but not too hard or too thick
because underneath it wasn't a lot of
definition but still a little bit of
definition because with Flex photography
kind of blows everything away and when
you don't apply anything underneath you
will kind of look sick sick sick so a
little bit on that lower lash line is
always ago now taking sable eyeshadow by
Mac this is going onto the outer corners
of the lid then blending up till the
crease and then sort of in the middle of
the lid as well now that it makes
expensive pink into sable and kind of
mix the two together and then apply that
to the lid as well you supply that to
like the middle and somewhat of the
inner part and this color oh my gosh and
then mixing and matching again then nice
pearl Sheen eyeshadow in mango and I'm
going to mix that with expensive pink
and then go ahead and apply that to the
inner part of the lid and kind of give
everything a nice gradient effect I'm
gonna give everything a nice blend
because it deserves to be blended we
found a black brush in the hopeless
place so you get this entire look that
sort of celebrity and perfect
professional feeling I'm gonna apply
some teeny tiny particles of glitter and
this is max oppressed pigment in light
touch this broke so I'm not gonna open
it in front of the camera but um this
has the perfect sort of like miniature
sort of particles in it and of glitter
and it's insanely pretty and trust me
when I say this is gorgeous
and to finish up my eyeshadow I'm going
to use this Mac pigment in vanilla and
this is going onto my inner corners for
some extra sparkle and glow and then
blend it out for eyeliner I'm going to
use my trusty old neck like neck fluid
line if where the eyeliner you actually
want to kind of keep it really simple
all the way into the inner corners right
here but we're not really gonna wing it
we're gonna give it like the tiniest
tiniest amount of a wing but we're not
gonna like go demi lovato
so remember don't add a huge line here
because if you make this too long your
wing will be too long and you want this
wing to be really really subtle and
short itch
and for the waterline I'm going to take
another Nixon glide on and slide on and
whatever on pencil and this is jet black
they're just kind of smudge that on to
sort of the lashline so not in your eye
but sort of on the border throw like the
edge and I'm just going to apply some
mascara this is my makeup studio
waterproof 3dx or black and then of
course some lashes to finish it all off
I don't know which ones these are but I
believe they are from the Katy Perry
lash line I'm not sure I'm going to try
to find it out but this is all I have in
my drawer so I don't know where the
entire packaging is of it but I think
it's one the Katy Perry line I'm pretty
sure I can send out Sam from the lips
and Rihanna were an amazing sort of
matte red like classic red lipstick I'm
gonna line and fill my entire lip in
with Mac's red lip pencil and then on
top Rihanna's favorite lipstick by Mac
Ruby woo it's a known fact that she
loves Ruby woo so we're going to use
Ruby woo today
against the fur blush I already
contoured my face using my NYX blush in
taupe and my LMS the blush and disobey
um so if you're thinking well you're
naturally skinny today no it's already
on for blush Rihanna had a really nice
glowy sort of cheek there wasn't really
a lot of color just a lot glow so I'm
going to use my neck warm soul minimize
blush and just put put it on and that's
why highlighter I'm going to use my
Mac's extra dimension skin finish in a
whisper of guilt and then just more glow
there you go with your glow so that boys
and girls completes my Rihanna look at
the Grammys 2013 material things so I
want to thinking is so much for watching
