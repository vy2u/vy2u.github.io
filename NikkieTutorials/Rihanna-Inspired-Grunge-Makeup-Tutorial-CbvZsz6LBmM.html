inspired by a picture that Rihanna
instagrammed it was a picture where she
said I love my fans they're so creative
and it was Rihanna with really really
dark brown lips the super grungy hair
and grungy eyes and I felt so inspired
to do a tutorial inspired by that look
it's oh I'm so ready for this look today
so I don't know if she actually wore
this look somewhere or that it is
photoshopped what I do know is that I
love this look and I'm creating it for
you today so if you want to know how to
get this look right here then please
stay tuned alright so the first thing
I'll be doing is applying a base to my
eyelids to prevent everything from
creasing and am using my soft ochre
Paint Pot by Mac and I'm applying this
with a zoeva 142 concealer buffer brush
now I'm going to take Mel Cosmetics blur
and mix it with unseen also by melt and
with a zoeva 228 I'm going to start
applying this to my crease and first you
want to focus most of it on the outer
part of your eyes and then keeping the
shape quite rounded on the outer edges
and then whatever is left on the brush I
start applying closer to the inner
corners of my eyes and making that nice
rounded shape also now I'm going to go
in makeup geek spoiled eyeshadow in
flamethrower and this is going on to the
outer third of my eyes blending in with
that rounded crease shape so you want to
flick it up and then with a brush blend
the edges into the crease so
flamethrower will also end up in the
crease a little bit for the lid I'm
taking makeup geek spoiled eyeshadow in
grandstand and this is going right next
to flamethrower onto the lid blending up
to the crease also and you can go as far
in as you like with this one
after the very inner corners of the lids
I'm taking this color pop super shock
shadow in I heart this oh and the burst
I've been applying all these widths is
stood 234 by zoeva this is going right
on the inner part that inner third and
I'm blending it into grandstand for the
lower lash line again taking grandstand
by makeup geek and with these away fat
226 I'm applying this all over my lower
lash line so from outer to inner corner
and a little bit blended down and then
because I want a little bit more
definition I'm taking a cold dark brown
and I'll be applying this on the outer
corner of my lower lash line and the
brush I'm using is de 237 by zueva any
dark brown will work you just want to
darken this part right here up a bit
because it will give it a little bit
more definition to the eyes and they get
ground and look more wearable for that
awesome in a corner Sparkle and first
laying down a base with my NYX jumbo
pencil in cottage cheese and I love this
for very fair skin tones to highlight
the inner corners with because there's
not a lot of products that actually
reflect on us I like putting this down
as a base to really catch the light and
then to really spark it up and taking my
jewel effects in shine by makeup studio
and that is going right over top now
with an angled brush and a dark dark
brown almost black shadow I'm running it
across my lash line to grab the lashes a
little bit more and to make my false
lashes blend in
so finish off the eyes all I'm going to
do now is the place and mascara to the
top lashes only and some policies and
the photos I'll be using today are by
Mac and these are the 36
all right on to cheeks so I already did
some cream contouring pre-filming so I
already have a little bit of sculpting
going on but I'm going to enhance that a
little bit more using my Illamasqua
eyeshadow in heroine just to intensify
it a little bit more and to make it look
a little less orange Rihanna's cheeks
looked really bronzy in the picture so
I'm going to go in to refine the golden
bronzer by Mac and with this further
warming up my complexion oh and the
brush I'm using is by makeup video and
it's the sl1
for blush with the buffy brown sheer
powder brush and the the balm hot mama
blush I love this color hot mama I'm
just taking a little tiny bit because
this one is pigmented mm-hmm and this is
going right onto the apples of the
cheeks and then blending back into the
contour and then to highlight I'm using
my favorite highlighting powder Becca
shimmering skin Perfector pressed in
moonstone so first this is going on to
the highest points of the cheeks to get
that glow going oh I love it so much
then once I've got that also the bridge
of the nose like that then we're going
to take a pencil brush and dip it into
the highlighting powder and I'm applying
the highlighting powder to the very
highest tip of my nose just to lift it
then also go ahead and highlight that
Cupid's bow and then your a highlighted
god the for those awesome dark brown
lips are first going in with an eye
pencil this is by essence and this is
the long-lasting eye pencil in number
two hot chocolate looks like that it's
dark brown
and then because this is a little bit
too cool tone and then leave them a bit
too dark for what Rihanna was wearing
I'm going over top with a colour-pop
lippie stix
and this is pitch and it has a really
nice warm undertone so this is going
right over top to get that warmth and
once you got that on that concludes the
look and the guys includes this Rihanna
