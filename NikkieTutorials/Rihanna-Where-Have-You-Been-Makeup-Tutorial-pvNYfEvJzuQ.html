on my favorite Rianne aware have you
been makeup look it's the red one where
have you been has been my favorite song
ever since the album of Rihanna came out
I have been obsessed with it and I love
I love them somewhere in the end in your
face that's like oh my stepdad and my
best friend's dead they're like changing
a window or something or something I
totally don't get with my blonde hair
gonna be a little bit noisy now and then
if you want to know how to do this
Rihanna where have you been red makeup
look then please keep on watching
so the first thing you want to do as
always is a PI a base here islets to
prevent this eye shadow from creasing
and the one I'm using is Mac soft ochre
Paint Pot the first eyeshadow we'll be
using is Mac's cork and I know I'm using
this way too much in my videos so what
you're gonna do with that is just bring
a little bit of definition into the
crease because once we add the red and
stuff it can look really flat and you
want to bring some depth into not death
depth in that crease and then at this
outer point right here kind of wing it
out and go back in as a base for my red
eye shadow I'm gonna apply a water
activate it sort of paint on my eyelid
this is design pro xstream color art and
passionate red and with that thing
you're going to make your basic shape
for the red and we're gonna start up all
the way at the inner corner going into
the crease and you want to be really
really delicate with this because if you
mess up you will look like Batman gone
wrong now not Batman spider-man and then
work your way up to the middle at the
crease and at the lid with it as well
and you want to make sure that this is a
straight line you don't want that to be
all wobbly and ugly when you're coming
near like the outer third you're gonna
wing it and then make the bottom blend
up towards to that you're gonna blend
the edges a bit to make them a bit
softer
for my red eyeshadow I will be using
sugar pills a love+
and just go over the red paint with that
just set it now to start off for the
black I'm gonna use mystery and spiced
chocolate and I'm starting off with
brown to sort of map out my shape and
then go back over with the black that I
was just going onto the lower lid then
from the outer point I'm going up from
that point go back into the red
now fill up that gap and then start
blending into the red I'm gonna take a
matte black eyeshadow carbon by MEK for
me I'm gonna go and smoke that along my
upper lash line not too harsh because
you don't want to take away the power of
that red because that is really like the
showpiece of the look I'm gonna take
cork by Mac again I'm sort of gonna play
with this crease because right now
anyone can tell that this is way too
harsh and you want it to be sort of soft
but harsh so just keep blending those
edges and make it look soft and harsh at
the same time and I'm gonna take my
sweet chestnut eyeshadow now this is a
limited edition one so if you don't have
this a really close one is makeup geeks
burlesque and I'm applying that's like
the middle closer to the lashes and then
going into the brown so not really
disturbing the red of more like in the
middle and then going out now I'm gonna
repack that red love plus by sugarpill
on because the red has to be the
showpiece of the look so make it pop I
feel like a goth spider-man I'm gonna go
back with my black and make my lashline
a little bit more smoky I'm gonna take
Urban Decay's 24/7 glide on pencil in
zero that is going on to the waterline
make it black as you can and then for
this inner corner make a point like that
now I'm going to take my carbon and
misery and from that point drag it along
the lower lash line
and now with carbon really make that
lower lid smokey and Arabic inspired or
Arabian inspired now once you feel like
this is too thick just take a concealer
brush with some concealer on it and just
kind of make it smaller
now Rihanna was wearing a really nice
inner corner silver highlight and my
favorite for that is makeup studio as a
shine and jewel effects so I'm gonna pop
that right right right here that gap
between the liner and the red right
there because it's pretty as hell and
then kind of blended up towards the
crease oh it's so bad as awesome
prettiness gorgeousness oh I'm not gonna
apply some mascara which is my favorite
mascara by makeup studio waterproof 3d
extra block okay now for your brows now
kind of do them how you normally do them
just make them a lot darker and bushy so
for me they are darker plus bushier and
for like the three strands that come out
I'm going to use mystery eyes shadow and
make it a little bit lighter with court
and just add three strands on like the
beginning of your brow and they can go
out as hell like stripes one
to
three it's that simple
now for ticks you want to be bronzed as
hell so first I'm gonna contour booth
with the sculpt powder by Mac and then
also your temples you want to be really
really bronzed for this look and then
I'm gonna take a bit of Mac's refined
golden bronzer and runs up the skin even
more and then you also want to be super
glowy for this look so I'm gonna take my
favorite whisper of guilt extra
dimension skin finished by Mac again and
just hi like the crap out of your face
every ellipse you just want to be really
really nude so I'm just gonna take some
of my lip erase and blot that on top and
then for a lipstick I'm using my
favorite flash pot lipstick and I like
to blend that in with my finger so yeah
