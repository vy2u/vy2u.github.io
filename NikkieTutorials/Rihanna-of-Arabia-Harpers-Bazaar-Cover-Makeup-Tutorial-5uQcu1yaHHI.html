tutorial inspired by Rihanna on the
cover of Harper's Bazaar and the sort of
the editorial was called Rihanna of
Arabia so we got this really sensual
graphic smokey eye liner look which is
really extreme and really it's for the
Daredevils out there and then her
signature red rear lip and then the
bronzy glowy skin I absolutely love it
plus I have gotten so many requests for
this look so I just had to do it for you
see ya other than that let's go right
ahead and go to the tutorial first
things first gonna apply a primer /
moisturizer to my face using my Mac prep
and prime natural radiance in radiant
yellow so now it's time for Foundation
and Rihanna did wear somewhat of a more
you know covered matte base so I am
going for my L'Oreal True Match in n1
because it has that matte feel but it
still glows does anyone get that and
then as always I'm applying this using
my makeup geek Foundation stippling
brush mmm I'm covering my look okay then
on to concealer I don't even have to
tell you what I'm using but I will this
is my Mac Pro Longwear concealer in NC
15 and I'm just gonna you know conceal
and then because I want a little bit
more of a stronger contour I'm gonna go
with another concealer this is L'Oreal
Lumi magique
Stilo touch the Lumia a touch of light
highlighting pen you could go English as
well and this is number one light and
I'm just gonna you know school to my
face a little bit more and is always
going to work this in using my F 86 by
Sigma
all right now I'm gonna set this entire
thing is in my chanell natural is
finished powder in number 20 Claire so
I'm gonna go ahead and powder do brows
and one eye off-camera
and then I'll be back vivid then they'll
will be back grammar grammar so the
first thing I did was prime my eyelids
using my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot and
I'll be going into my sauce box a tude
palette from the palette I'll be taking
this color right here and this color
right here and with that you want to
slightly build some definition into the
crease the tiniest bit and mainly on the
middle of the crease so we're not
blending outside here and outside here
but just mainly keep it here on the
middle and blend up then from that same
palette I'm taking this creamy color and
with this I'm highlighting my brow bone
blending that crease color out even more
and also lightening up my inner corners
quite a bit again same palette taking
this red brick color right here and just
applying the tiniest bit of that on my
lower lash line and softly blending that
down
don't make this too concentrated and too
much there because all the attention has
to go to that eye shape that eyeliner
the eyeliner I'll be using is by L'Oreal
and this is the perfect slim super liner
I am so happy with this one because it
actually worked talking through this
part is going to be quite hard so I'm
gonna you know just kind of work it out
a bit the first thing I'm going to do is
make this line right here so this is
fundamental to sort of you know
determine the shape you're going for
what you want to keep in mind is that
you want to look at your waterline and
kind of drag that out and it's easier to
start up a little bit shorter with your
line than going wait so long at the
beginning because you can always
lengthen it a bit more at the end okay
from this line you want to go into your
crease and kind of make
the sort of the hill down a little bit
further down that you normally would
okay once I got that I want to map out
my crease and you want to go a little
bit higher and rounder up in the middle
of your crease and steeper down and with
a loop up again so I'm going to look
straight forward into a mirror and map
out where I want my crease to be and
kind of want to make it a tad bit higher
than your crease but not too much then
from there connect this point at that
point and then little by little you want
to add a stroke to fill it up a little
bit more until it looks right I'm going
to just add the tiniest bit of stroke to
it because it's a little bit too steep
for me now and I want it to be a little
bit more flat what if I worked best is
to now do that in a corner and then
connect that to the middle of the crease
what I'm going to do is look a little
bit down and then just draw in this
triangle
and then from that point go into the
crease and then for now leave that shape
to rest and fill this entire thing in
and then you can really look at where it
needs a little bit more and where it
needs some less okay so as I said now
it's the time to totally perfect that
shape I can tell that if I compare it to
the finished eye that this swoop right
here is a little bit too low Plus this
line can be a little bit longer so I'm
going to try my hardest to match this
eye as much to this eye of course if you
made a little booboo you can always take
some concealer this is my mac studio
finish concealer in NC 15 and a
concealer brush and just clean up any
edges
from the same softbox pellet of taking
the black and with this I'm going to set
the eyeliner on my waterline I'll be now
using my smashbox always chopper
waterproof eye pencil in raisin and with
an angled brush in a little bit of the
black eyeshadow again i'm gonna smudge
the line really closely to my lash line
and stop about right here okay so I
think I'm pretty content with that I'm
gonna go on to mascara I am gonna skip
false lashes because I think they have
no use because it's all their black
shape and a little of the flash is not
gonna help it one bit so for mascara I'm
going to use my waterproof 3d in extra
black body makeup studio and then it
will be back okay so for cheeks you want
to go really sculpted and brontë with a
little bit of a summary glow so in order
to achieve that I'm going to contour
using my illamasqua eyeshadow in heroine
then I'm going to add that summery
bronze using my Lancome star bronzer in
number three just really softly warm up
the tops of your cheekbones with this as
well as the middle of your forehead
blending down and your neck for blush
I'm using my Mac mineralized blush in
warm soul then for my highlight I'm
using Mac's a soft and gentle for lips
you want to go for a very striking matte
red lip and for this how fitting I'm
gonna go for Mac's RiRi woo it might not
be my favorite lipstick but it's
matching to today's theme
oh my god heavens why is this lipstick
so dry anyone who wears this on a
day-to-day basis I applaud you because
