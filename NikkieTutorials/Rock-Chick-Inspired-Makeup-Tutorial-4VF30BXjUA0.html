rock chicks or like they're really tough
girls and um just because I didn't want
to do just a black eye I added some
glitter so you can go out with it and um
I did my hair really really wild as well
yes so today I did a look unlike the
rock chick inspired stuff and um I'm
going to include some pictures of
wearing a gloss on top because if you
apply a gloss on top of this look it
will become greasy and it's going to
crease and that will like make it even
more rock Chikara also in this video
we're using the 120 palette from BH
Cosmetics again
I usually with Christmas - and this
thing I love you I love you but if you
want to know how to get this like rock
chick glittery outgoing look then please
keep unlocking locking yes lock on then
please keep on watching if you decide to
not put the gloss on your eyelids after
you've done the look then please put a
primer on your eyelids to prevent the
eyes from creasing and to do that you
can use BH Cosmetics eye on lip primer
so if you use this it won't crease and
if you don't it will crease a little and
then you add the gloss and it will
crease a lot so today we're using d bh
cosmetics palette in number three again
this is what it looks like and we're
going to start up with the most black
color right there the first thing I'm
going to do is I'm going to take this
piece I'm Pro on number five brush and
I'm going into the matte black color of
this palette and you're going to define
your crease first so take a brush and
define your crease
you
now connect it with the bottom part of
your eyes like so now blend it out a bit
and go into exact color so 1 2 3 in and
1 2 3 up and with that color you're
going to blend above the black
now with a 217 with nothing on it just
blended even further now I'm taking a
mech 217 and I'm going back into the
black and we're going to blend the black
into the brown
now with this stargazer angled brush
we're going to apply a eyeliner to our
lash line
now we're going to take a brush like
this and we're going back into the black
and we're going to make the lid black
until like a space like that just to
open the eyes up a little bit more so
don't completely close it off so go in
and stop around there to highlight we're
going to take this lightest color here
that's my bed in a part of her I a
little bit more opened up we're going to
grip this color right here that one okay
now that color then we applied onto the
brow bone that is going on to the inner
corners as well so go ahead and do that
now for the lower lash line I'm going to
grab this brush again and we're going
into the black again and just make your
lower lash line completely black and
smoke it down the glitter that is going
on to like the inner parts right here is
a Max reflex pearl reflex pearl and to
make it stick we're going to use makeup
studios to weigh down
but first I'm applying some of the to a
gel to the parts where I want it and
then grab the glitter and put that on
top okay now for the lower lashes um I
have this amazing glitter is amazing I
mean it looks like a mermaid in a jar
these glitters are actually meant for
nails and I was in The Hague with a
friend of mine and we went to the market
and then I saw this and I went crazy so
actually these are nil glitters so if
you wonder like where I'm going to get
this try searching web shops with a
chunky Neal glitter so it isn't meant
for your eye but if you take it up
really carefully nothing really can
happen so with a brush like this and to
wait out I'm going to apply this glitter
again I'm putting the two way gel where
I want the glitter to be
I'm coming home so all that's left to do
is smoke the water line with urban decay
24/7 in zero this is the best eye pencil
ever and um on my lashes I'm going to
use makeup studio maximum volume and
voluminous carbon black and with a new
lip color of your choice your look is
done um but again if you don't like new
lips just put on some darker gloss or a
brighter gloss I think that with this
eyes you need lips but it's up to you
take some Elizabeth Arden 8 hour cream
and if you put this on your lids um it's
gonna crease and it's gonna look gooey
and shiny and I love this
I had a Twitter icon um a couple of
months ago with like a really wet eye
and people ask me what I used
thank you guys so much for watching um
yeah uh keep Rocking don't stop in I
love you good bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
