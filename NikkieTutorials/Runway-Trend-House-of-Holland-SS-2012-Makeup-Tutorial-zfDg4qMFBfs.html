on spring summer house of Holland the
runway look I absolutely love it it's so
grungy but still this will make blue
eyes pop like no other so today I
decided to do another runway look so if
you want to know how I did this look
then please keep on watching so the
first thing you want to do is apply a
base to your eyelids to prevent this
eyeshadow from creasing as always and
the one I'm using is soft ochre Paint
Pot from Mac okay so the first color
going to use is this one my face front
and this is called every kata and then
on top to make it a little bit lighter
I'm going to use L'Oreal's color and
fillable number two and this is
hourglass beige first I'm going to take
that face from I shadow I'm going to
apply that onto my lid and by the way
this eyeshadow is available I'm swept
shop heads close mates guys duh and now
just putting it out there there look at
that is a little bit to oranjee I'm
gonna place that will real color on top
to make it a little bit more lighter now
that I take this Illamasqua I pencil in
Rohde and this is a really warm orange
color and I'm just going to make a line
into my crease for some definition
now I'm going to take a brush and blend
that out now I'm going to take to really
warm orange colors this is face front
token which is a beautiful shimmering
copper color and I'm going to take max
saffron eyeshadow I'm gonna mix it too
but take a little bit more of the face
one color and I'm just going to blend
that into the crease on top of that
illamasqua pencil now just take token
only from face front and just go on top
and blue line it in and I'm gonna take
my favorite blending brush which is the
MEK 224 and I'm just gonna blend this
out softly now going back with my
L'Oreal infallible color in our class
beige and I'm gonna go back onto my lid
to make it a little bit more light again
now I'm gonna take this Illamasqua
pencil in Sophie and there's a great
cause behind this definitely go check it
out on the Illamasqua website and what
I'm gonna do is trace a line under my
eyes just fill it in and make it black
and then at that point right there go on
into your upper lash line like that now
fill this entire space in
now I'm going to take another face front
I too know this is called printed and
with printed I'm just going to set that
black eyeliner we just place then just
take a pencil brush and blend it out a
little bit so it's not such a raccoon
ish vibe over there we want to look like
supermodels not super vicunas now I'm
going to take a nude eye pencil this is
uh what is this this has been nice
neutralizer creme crayon and red
concealer number one and I'm gonna pop
this onto my waterline I'm not gonna
curl my lashes with my Shorea
eyelash curler and a little teeny bit of
mascara on the top lashes for that I'm
using makeup studios water-resistant
volumes gara okay for the lips and
models were a really nude nude beige
live almost as if they're a lips were a
little bit dead for that I'm going to
use Inglot pella that I have this is
their freedom system lipsticks stuff and
we're gonna take this new color I don't
know which color uh which number it is
but I will put it on my website and I'm
just gonna dab that on so you guys that
