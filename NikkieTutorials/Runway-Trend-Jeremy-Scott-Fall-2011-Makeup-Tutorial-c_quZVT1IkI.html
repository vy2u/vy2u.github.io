shower and I felt like going crazy on
color so a couple of months ago there
was Fashion Week and Jeremy Scott did
this amazing show with really bright
colors and Meg did their makeup with the
pace charts so the PR from xnt their
face charts and I tried to recreate that
look today so basically you have three
types of looks you have the blonde girls
with the greenish look you had the brown
haired girls with this look and some
girls had orange instead of the red um
so yeah today I'm doing this extreme
color Jeremy Scott Fashion Week look
which is the long one and if you want to
know how I did this then please keep on
watching okay so the first thing we're
going to do is we're going to take a
bright bright orange eye pencil on the
max HR they use genuinely orange or some
things on now safety orange paint stick
it's like a paint stick in a bright
bright neon color I don't have that so
for me I'm going to use the Illamasqua
eye pencil and trash and just start with
putting that onto your lid only and up
to the crease but not in the crease then
I'm going to take a really really small
brush and blend that evenly onto the lid
and blend it a bit in the crease and
with that same brush I'm going to take
max rule eyeshadow and I'm just going to
set that on to that eye pencil now for
the crease they used a cherry lip pencil
from MEK I don't have cherry but I do
have red so I'm going to use a red into
the crease first is make a line where
you would start an eyeliner with and
then go all the way into your crease so
as you can see I now hit that red liner
in my crease but I feel like it's too
small so I'm going to make it thicker
and go up to make it bigger
here once you have the eyeliner on
you're going to blend it as well and
blend it up in short strokes now going
to take mixed pigment in basic red this
is a sample that I have and with the
same brush just set that red lip pencil
now I'm going to take with my pigment in
primary yellow and this is another
sample I'm going to put that primary
yellow on my brow bone and Pat it on or
else you will get fallout okay what you
want to do now is blend that red into
the yellow and the yellow into the red
and to help you do that you can I use
some blending brushes I'm going to blend
with the primary red pigment I'm going
to take some of the rule and then go
back with the yellow just keep blending
until you like it and I blend it all the
way up to my brow the red because that
is what the models had and just blend
that baby boy for the lower lid they use
electric eel eyeshadow from Mac and I'm
just going to pop that onto the lower
lid and make it sort of like an Arabic
shape so first make a stripe going like
that like that and then from that point
right there go all the way right there
see how you just make it like a rebek
inspired eyeliner with blue
alright and then the last thing I'm
going to do is put some primary yellow
pigment on to that little white corner
that is remaining okay what I'm now
going to do is put some mascara on this
is 202 and nachi from Mac on the water
leg I used a white pencil this is pure
white chrome graphic pencil from neck
and then I'm going to put some lashes on
I don't have the mech ones that they
used so I'm going to use the makeup
studio number 17 for the lower lash line
because they have lower lashes as well
and once they are on I'm going to put
mascara on top of those to make it more
like there and then on the top lashes
I'm using makeup studio number 18 which
look like that okay bear in mind that my
eye shape is totally not ideal for this
look the perfect eyes for this look will
be um when a girl has almost no brow
space I have a lot of space between my
crease and my brows and this look will
be perfect for girls with not a lot of
room between the cruise and the break so
for on the lips the face chart said that
they had thinned your mane on and myth
so I'm going to do exactly that
for a full list of all products to use
go to my website accusatorial calm you
can see the face chart over there as
well I love you thank you guys for
watching and hopefully I will see you
guys next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
