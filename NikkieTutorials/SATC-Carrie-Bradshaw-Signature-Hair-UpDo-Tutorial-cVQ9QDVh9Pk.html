on Carrie Bradshaw Sex in the City a
signature updo she always has that like
really slicked back hair really nice big
perfect hair bun so yeah if you want to
know how to get a really high perfect
bun then please keep a watch okay so um
this is my hair I like how do I color
than you too but it's like when you
haven't washed it for two days two day
hair second hair 6 second hair I'm
saying this is second day hair um but
the fun thing about this hairstyle is
that you can it doesn't matter if you
just washed it if it is greasy as hell
because you're gonna pin it back and
make a big like bun anyway so you're not
gonna see any grease or stuff maybe
sometimes grease is even better than
just the clean like really clean hair
Carrie has this hair saw a lot in the
seasons and in movies and I absolutely
love it and what we're gonna start off
with is the best thing about this book
is that you don't have to prep your hair
and prepping is like put mousse in it
put any type of product in it that's
gonna make it that's gonna give the hair
more texture what we're gonna do and
this is probably the hardest part of all
we're gonna make a ponytail as high as
you want the bun to beads and you want
your hair the hair right here to be as
flat as possible as tight and flat up as
possible to help you with that there are
several versions out there in the
industry that are designed to give it
like that smooth polished look I'm gonna
use a Mason Pearson if you're wondering
what that this that is my name because
when you're on the set with the team
sometimes one person in team is a freaky
as a liar and takes her stuff so you
have to put your name on it so the first
thing you want to do is just take your
hair and gather it all and just put it
in the ponytail
as high as you want it that is how high
the button is going to be and make this
as as tight and smooth as you possibly
can
and I know why Sarah Jessica Parker love
this because it instantly gives that
lift to your skin
I'm not gonna take some kills gel to
make it nice and flat and there's no
flyaways um Carrie Bradshaw didn't
really have this she sometimes I had it
really slicked back but sometimes like
really frizzy as well I'm gonna do the
really slicked back one so I'm just
going to take some clippings I'm gonna
clip them around and then I just have
more hair to work with
now you just have to I with my hair back
and forth hair once you have that the
magic piece of this tutorial is coming a
hair donut and with a this is like the
vesting inhibit ever you can decide on
your own how high and big you want to
make the bun if you take to of course
gonna get bigger if you take one's gonna
get smaller but the thing is you just
want to gather all your hair again and
put the hair going up around it like
that I think I'm gonna add another one
just to look you see and that is to I
think I'm gonna go over to I mean it's
Carrie Bradshaw you can do anything with
her and all you want to do now is divide
all of that hair around these hair
donuts so you're going to take apart
right here I'm gonna take apart like
that you're gonna lay down like that
over the hair donut and then you just
pin it back so the hair donut is covered
I'm gonna take a you can for that I'm
just gonna tuck the hair in and you
wanna lay it around the hair donut and
then pin it down just with the you pin
kind of push it in so it's stuck
and just do that to the entire thing
okay once you're done you're gonna have
a cart that is not going anywhere that
is what you want because you're going to
rip that part around the bun to make it
nice and finished off so you're just
gonna pin that down as well
okay now I'm just gonna add some
hairspray to the entire thing to make it
nice and smooth
and that is how Carrie Bradshaw does her
signature really high perfect bun of
course if you want to make it more
memorable of course just use one hair
gonna I absolutely love it is this such
a statement of course it's a little bit
too big for me I should have used one
hair done' but again it's fun to see
what it can do um so yeah if you have
any questions leave them in the comment
