dressing up as a Chanel from scream
queens but with a little twist I wanted
to show you my twist on the helix liner
that has been going around and I made it
a devil's tail yeah you see it it's a
devil's tail wrapping around my winged
eyeliner and I'm dressed up as a Chanel
and I'm feeling this
I absolutely with a passion love scream
queens so I just had to do a tribute for
Halloween this year so without any
further ado if you would like to know
how to get this whole look right here
then keep on watching alright guys so
let's get this scream queens devil look
started so the first thing I'm gonna do
is go in with a primer this is my girl
Leia Gold primer and I'm gonna be
applying this to just mmm
to just lift my face and give it that
amazing luxurious well primed feel for
foundation I'm going to keep it safe and
go with what I know will work and will
last all night long I'm gonna go in with
the Too Faced Born This Way in ivory and
Oprah absolute cover in point 5 this
combo truly is like magic to me because
it lasts all day long and it gives me a
beautiful flawless finish
for concealer of course I'm going to go
with my all-time favorite my ride-or-die
my Tarte shaped tape in fair
and now I'm going to bake my under-eye
area to highlight and set it for the
entire night and I'm just going to set
the rest of my face to look flawless on
birch all right face done on to the eyes
I'm first going to prime using my paint
pot by Mac and soft ochre now set
increased sobral bone using porcelain
eyeshadow buy more feet to help lending
later on
now going into the more feet little
eyeshadow palette in Kokomo kheh
and I'm going to be taking this color
right here as a transition shade in my
crease and we're just going to use the
shade as a transition shade inner crease
to add some soft definition but mainly
as our blending color
now moving along to that color right
next to it to further deepen and
intensify that crease starting out by
placing that color and the brush on my
outer third and then gently sweeping it
into the crease of further declining as
we blend for the lid I'm going to be
taking the morphe 35o palette and taking
this color right here to highlight the
lid and the brow bone
and then going back in with that little
morphe brush and blending the edges of
the light shimmery shade and the crease
shade now go ahead and pick up that
light shimmery shade from the 35e
palette again and blind those inner
corners for the lower lash line I'm
hopping over to the little morphe i
shadow palette in coffee toffee and
using this color to smoke out my lower
lash line
and this is going all the way to the
inner corners first I'm going to add my
black wing using my Tom Ford eye
defining pen in number one deeper and
you want to make this wing longer than
you think from that line drag it on back
to the lid and now filling in the blank
space using the Mac liquid last liner in
black like that Congrats
you now have a black wing line ready to
be devil eyes for the devil liner I'm
going to use the acrylic paint by Mac in
basic red and this tiny teeny detailed
eyeliner brush by Jack's Beauty line in
number two and the devil liner should
come from the base of your lashes wrap
around the black liner go we rounded go
around it again we wing it out and we
give it its little tail
so notice how right now the devils till
is a really wrapping around the black
liner that's why you want to cover the
middle section of the tail with black
liner so that it looks like it's
wrapping around the liners see I'm going
to finish this look off using some
lashes by Lena lashes these are in the
style Tina and also playing some bottom
lashes and these are precious by house
of lashes
for contour today of course I'm gonna go
in with my Kevyn Aucoin
medium sculpting powder people always
ask me why I don't change it up but
honey when it ain't broke why fix it
because this is amazing and I'm gonna be
applying that using a new contour
favorite this is the morphe 4
I was a little bit skeptical before
using it whether I would like it or not
but I fallen in love with it because it
just really quickly and easily defines
and cuts the cheekbone and it's it's
everything and of course I'm also going
to do my jaw line cuz honey cleaning it
up sharpening it making it fun Lala's
for blush you're going to go in with
this beautiful one by Mac this is in the
color Spellbinder and another favorite
new brush this is the e3 buy more feet
and this combo this color of this blush
and this brush it's like mmm heaven on
earth it's so quick and easy yet so
beautiful and satisfying like McDonald's
for highlighter today I am so excited to
share this with you the LA girl strobe
light strobing powders are phenomenal
this is their lightest color 120 watt
which is very damn light and then this
is another favorite the 100 watt and
especially together they make for a
stunning glow they're super affordable
and the quality and formula is amazed
I'm just gonna blind the red devil away
with my clothes
I mean like are you flipping kidding me
today and I'm sitting that all into
place using my white charcoal setting
sprayed by Bo chef for lips are going to
keep it simple because I want all the
attention to go to the devil eyeliner
and I'm going to go in with the jus a
lip cream in melon first oh my god that
is a stunning color
well damn you know what I thought I
wanted to go in with another color but
I'm obsessed with this color right here
so that is the look and that guys
