on this makeup look right here which I
oh I love it it's just so catty and
whiny and smoky and I I love this makeup
look it was inspired by Selena Gomez at
the 2015 AMAs she so laid that look
honey and the performance we call girl
Selena was definitely my top favorite of
the night she looked gorgeous I love the
pop of copper and red so I was inspired
by her makeup look to create this look
right here so yeah I need further ado if
you would like to know how to give this
Selena Gomez inspired makeup look then
watching as always the first thing I'll
be doing is priming my eyelids and I'm
using my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot for
this and I'm applying this using a sigma
3d HD precision brush then with a light
cream colored eyeshadow I'm setting my
crease and brow bone area and this will
help me blend the shadows I put in the
crease a lot easier for my crease I'll
go in with the Urban Decay blush in
video and makeup geeks cherry cola eyes
shadow and with a morphe and 505 I'm
first blending this into my crease but
mainly on the outer part and winging it
out
then with a zueva 220 brush I just
softly blend the edges now with cherry
color only and that same brush start
building up definition going in with
Mac's a little lusty blush and this is
the exact red tone that Selena had on
her outer crease and inner crease so I'm
going to apply that to the outer and
inner crease and i'm using a morphe g17
for this and this way you can just make
everything a little teensy bit more
bright for the lid up first going in
with Kat Von D's metal crush eyeshadow
in raw power and I'm applying this with
a Mac 239 following through with this
next prismatic eyeshadow in fireball
and for a pop of peach I'm using this uh
Nastasia Beverly Hills illuminator in
peach nectar and with a zueva 234 that
is going on the inner third of the lid
for the lower lash line and going back
in with fireball by NYX and then with
that Mac blush and a Sigma e 15 I'm just
adding more red to the lower lash line
now I'm going to apply the Urban Decay
24/7 waterline pencil and legend to my
waterline and now directly to the roots
of the lashes apply some black shadow
now it's time for that beautiful smoky
liner so first I'm going in with my Kat
Von D ink liner in trooper to make my
lines and then fill in using my Sigma
line ace in legend
once you've got that line now you want
to grab these the wave a 322 and smoke
it out with a black eyeshadow all I want
to do now is finish the look off with
some lashes and these are hooded beauty
Audrey and a little trick I always do to
get the inner corners lifted is I come
with a tweezer from above and kind of
bend them straight out so I just go to
that root gonna stick it straight up
kind of lifted up
and then what also helps is just with
your finger and a push out of so they
lift up BAM four cheek Selina didn't
really have much going on on the apples
of her cheeks
it was mostly contour and warmed up with
the blush and lots of glow so first I'm
going to broaden up my face using this
Too Faced endless summer 16 hour long
wear bronzer and the brush I'll be using
for this is a morphe m5 27 just lightly
contour and bronze up your face with
this bronzer or any bronzer you may have
I love this bronzer so much it's not too
orange it's not too yellow it's not too
dirty and then what I always like to do
is take a big fluffy brush and just buff
everything in even more so it's
traceless and blend it in and just look
good now for a highlighter today I'm
going to go in with Anastasio Philly
Hills star light illuminator and I'm
using a sigma high cheekbone highlighter
fo3 brush for this and then also
highlight the tip of my nose the bridge
of the nose and my Cupid's bow and then
for blush I'm going to use Urban Decay's
blush in video again the same that went
into the crease and I'm just taking a
little bit because the Urban Decay
blushes are super pigmented and a Sigma
s 37 brush which I really love for blush
lately and from the contour kind of go
up to the highlight and kind of diffuse
everything together but don't really
come forward to the apple of the cheek
because Selena definitely didn't have
anything
so just keep it on the side like a sob
bitch look at that hole now all I'm
going to do to finish this off is spray
my face using these skin and Naevia make
a finishing spray I love this one get
rid of the powder look her lips are
going to use this Urban Decay liner in
naked Urban Decay Naked lipliner and
this is the exact color I'm looking for
so I'm also going to fill in the entire
lip with this
and then only in the center a little bit
of melted sugar by two-phased and then
finished off with the gloss and the
gloss I'll be using is my current
favorite by Sigma this is the lip
eclipse in Seal of Approval and that's
it guys that concludes my Selena Gomez
