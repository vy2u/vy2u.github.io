hi guys today I'm here to bring you my
September hits Anna God knows I'm so
used to seeing October already but we're
just in the midst of October let's focus
on September so throughout the month of
September I had some great new favorites
and I've been really playing around with
the stuff and I've been really falling
in love with it plus I haven't oh god no
so let's shake Luis and get the juice I
don't know what I'm saying
let's go so the first product I want to
talk about is by girl and this is called
the allure gold primer no the allure
pure radiance concentrated with pure
gold primer gold primer now I found out
about this product on glam life gurus
channel and Tati was talking about it
and she talked about how it totally
lifted her face and it completely
changed the tightness of her face and it
just looked more radiant and I was like
sold sold and sold thank you so I've
been trying this for like a good three
to four weeks now and I am obsessed I
feel like it keeps my makeup on longer I
do see that lifting and tightening
effect that Tati is talking about I
personally don't really notice any
change with my pores it doesn't fill
them up it doesn't make my pores look
smaller so it doesn't really do anything
for larger pores it's just to lift
radiates it is definitely a luxurious
product it is not cheap but with that
comes that you only need a tiny tiny bit
I take two pumps and I don't even wear
makeup on a daily basis so this will
last me for a lifetime
I'm very addicted to the stuff and I
love it I do quickly want to address
that some people said that gold is that
for your skin and I believe every part
of gold that is the low 24 karats is bad
for your skin but this is 24 karats so I
think we're safe next up is a skin care
product I've been obsessing over this
bowshot Tsubaki Beauty oil I'm so
excited to share this with you it
promises to hydrate and replenish
leaving skin smoother softer and more
supple now when I first tried this out
I have used so many moisturizers and my
skin has gradually shifted from oily to
dry combination so I get really dry
patches and like really oily t-zone it's
the worst it's like come on skin make up
your damn mind what do you want to be I
applied this at night and I found myself
the following morning feeling super soft
and plump not bloated not in a negative
way but my skin felt and looked more
plump and more even and just ha I think
this is one of the best oils out there
to make your skin a lot more soft and
hydrated plus it gives you that supple
plump feel and look especially for me my
chin and jaw area is like the worst the
following morning it will just feel so
soft and even and smooth I'm obsessed
with the stuff it lasts for a really
long time I hate products that just
disappear into the skin I want to feel
that moisture on top of my skin it makes
it look super oily but I don't care
about that because it is amazing oh
another product my Bush I really quickly
wanted to talk about is this white
charcoal mattifying makeup setting spray
this is my second bottle I love this
stuff this is a setting spray for your
makeup to lock it in and have it on all
day long but why I like it so much is
that it is mattified now of course I
always go for that blinding glowy look
but I want certain parts of my face to
be blinding and glowy so I like a matte
base a matte powder base with blinding
cheeks tip of nose Cupid's bow but I
want everything I put on for the rest of
my face to stay there all day long and
just not budge or move and I feel like
this motion makeup setting spray really
helps with that it totally locks it into
place it gets rid of a powdery look it
just melts everything together but it
keeps you matte which I love because I
love matte phase blinding areas the
bottle is huge you will do so long with
this I love it
alright really quickly going back to a
new favorite skincare product this is by
tatcha and this is the polished classic
rise and zine powder and
I got this because of Manny here on
YouTube you talked about it in was that
a favorite was it his right or die tag I
don't remember so he talked about it and
I went out and bought it for myself and
at first I was like what is this even
doing because it is so a micro-thin
it is truly like a rice powder it is so
thin and you have to wet it and then
massage your face with it and at first
the first time I tried it I was like
what is this what does it even do
who pots yes but after giving it some
more opportunities to do something for
my face I felt like it gave me the
softest scrub it's really gentle but it
still gets rid of like any loose skin it
just gets rid of every dead skin cell
that is on your face but it's really
soft and gentle plus I also feel like it
takes away any leftover makeup on your
face it just cleans you up and it leaves
you really nice clean and glowy and
shiny almost so right after I wash my
face with cleanser then is when I will
go in with this powder and go in with an
extra little boost of cleaning and a
little boost of scrubbing and I just I
love the results I feel like my skin
cleared out a lot after using this and
I'm a fan moving on to Joo hua has been
really fast Li and quickly rising on the
top of my favorites list I went to Paris
with GE and it was such a magical
experience so two products really
stepped out in the sunlight for me
first of all this launched yesterday but
I've been playing around with this ever
since Paris this is their new eyeshadow
palette it is called the essential matte
and shimmer eyeshadow palette and it is
a beautiful stunning neutral palette it
has seven mattes and five shimmer
eyeshadows and it costs $40 and it's
just $40 worth of amazing neutralness
now I'm the type of person to tell you
when you have the 3500 by morphe you do
not need any other neutral palette out
there but I feel like this quality and
just pigmentation and and ease of
working with really sells this palette I
think the color range is perfect this
black
does not play games it is so intense
this warm brown color is what my dreams
are made of because I look I'm wearing
the pallid on my eyes today I love it so
much I was lucky enough to play with
this for a little longer than the rest
of everyone in the world and I feel so
privileged and it really got me to play
with this palette and try it out and I
must say I really really do like it I do
have a little tiny bit of an additional
like suggestion to future palettes I
feel like this row right here is a lot
of the same colors I would have liked it
more this top row was a little bit more
diverse but other than that I think this
palette is awesome and I just feel like
that for the 40 dollars you pay for this
you get such high quality product I'm in
love with this palette another product
by Xu Wei which is a highlighter I've
been obsessed with this we got this in
Paris it's been it's abused and used
this right here is a citrine highlighter
now we got this in Paris and ever since
Paris it's pretty much the only
highlighter I've worn on my face I am
obsessed beyond words obsessed with
citrine it's just a blinding it's just
everything you want for a glowy face let
me tell you when I first saw this I was
like that's gonna be too dark for my
skin tone but it has a beautiful way of
blinding but not becoming stark and to
offsetting against the skin it has a
lovely golden warm undertone which
totally blends it into the skin and just
makes it look like magical magical
unicorn powers it's an amazing
highlighter it's one of my top favorites
and ever since Paris is the only one
I've used and a highly suggested it just
sold out right now so why am I even
telling you about this next up I found
this out because of Lee Dickinson here
on YouTube I have pronounced that right
but Lee told us in a recent video that
she has been obsessed with a new way of
setting her brows and she learnt this
from another youtuber so this right here
is by Mac this is the false lashes
Maximizer now this is one of those
classic white primer mascara to just lay
your eye
she's with Lee and the person she got it
from
we're so genius to use this as an
eyebrow gel now when I first heard this
I was like girl you crazy but I went to
the airport I walked across Mac I was
like you know what I'm just gonna buy it
and try it out in Paris
I feel like Paris it's a trip where all
these favorites happened let me tell you
I applied this to my brows and I could
push them into every direction I wanted
them and they stayed there this is to my
knowledge the most powerful brow setter
of life this will survive everything and
anything and what I like I have really
sparse brows so I like to push the
Front's of my brows to each other to
give him a more bushy and natural feel
and with the Anastacio one with so many
brow gels I felt like it went to that
direction I wanted a two but eventually
just started going back into my natural
hair direction with this it just pushes
it into that direction you wanted to and
it just stays there and it makes your
brows look flawless and a flake for the
entire day the only downfall with this
product is is that it has a white cast
so what I do is when I take the brush
out I scrape the brush against the side
of the little container and that takes
most of the product off but enough to
coat your hairs with and to make them
stay there all day long I love this
stuff and highly obsessed with it ever
since I've gotten it I was like look at
my bushy brows next up also discovered
by Lee the same girl that introduced me
to the MAC Cosmetics
I brought Rick another I brought Rick
she gave us was if you are sick and
tired of dip brows or you feel like you
are a blonde and they never get your
tone right try out this Mac Paint Pot in
Taylor gray so I did and this has been
everything for my brows though you only
tap your brush into this once and you
have more than enough for one brow and I
just used this to fill my brows in with
and I feel like the undertone and just
the entire color of the brows is perfect
for light fair skin tones with blond
hair or if you just want beautiful taupe
brows this is perfect for that it's a
Paint Pot so it's
meant to last and I feel like it
definitely last the entire day for me in
the past before my brows would get oily
with certain products but with this it
just stays there it's a Paint Pot so
it's gonna stay there the entire day and
I'm really really liking this so ever
since Lee and her video this has been on
my brows and I'm obsessed and that were
all the hits for the month of September
for me I really really love these
products and i really suggest you giving
them a shot all these products I just
mentioned I obsess over and every time I
get to play with them again I'm like it
gets so happy and excited on the inside
I'm like yay so if you asked me if
spilled enough love let's spill the tea
what is my oh god no this month oh yeah
no my oh god no this month is from
benefit now benefit recently launched an
entire new brow collection and I feel
like they really really really really
slayed that collection like they went
full in I feel like most of the products
are amazing but there's this one product
in there where I'm like why did you even
make this let's just get it out the way
there I love the new brow collection but
this product right here they need to
draw this is the Bravo conditioning
primer by benefit and this promises to
condition and prime your brows and even
make your brows grow fuller so me with
my sparse brows I went oh my god give it
to me right now so I tried it for three
weeks nothing I was like is hair even
still growing here is anything still
happening here nothing grew anything
more than usual and using it as a primer
I feel like once you go over top with
product it starts to flake and become
this like flake City it's a mess I just
feel like the applicators a little too
big as well and it's just this gel
primer and it does nothing honestly it
does nothing and if you applied as a
primer it stays wet too for so long so
you have to wait there for a just to
start doing your brows and then once you
actually start doing your brows it
flakes off and becomes a flaky mess and
it's just I do not see the use of this
product claims of it making your brows
grow faster not for me and just this has
been a huge disappointment for three
weeks I was like go girl
do something did nothing goodbye so that
is it guys that were my hits and oh god
