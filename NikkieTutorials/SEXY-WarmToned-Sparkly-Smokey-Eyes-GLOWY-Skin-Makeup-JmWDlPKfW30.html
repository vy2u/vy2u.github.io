ordered some new Anasazi Beverly Hills
eyeshadows off of Sephora and they came
in yesterday and they truly inspired me
to come up with this makeup look right
here it's a very warm toned 60 smokey
eye with a glitter pink and silver
glitter and then I wanted to do
something different for the lips so not
go with like a typical nude or like a
dark or like a red so I went for like a
cool toned pinky nude which totally
contrasts with the eyes and I am totally
living for it I went for my cool girl
hair so yeah if you would like to know
how to get this makeup look right here
then keep on watching alright guys so
the first thing you want to do is
moisturize your skin so you have a nice
base to work with and my skin is still a
little bit dry from all the drama that
happened last week so prior to filming I
again went in with this olavo superfood
ease comb cleansing oil it's a two way
product it can be used to take your
makeup off with as a like break up oil
but it's also great as a serum which is
what I use it for and again I went in
with my most hardcore moisturizer I know
of beauty sleep cream by olavo as well I
do however I want to minimize the
appearance on my pores a little bit so
I'm gonna go in with the pores no more
pore refiner primer by dr. brandt and i
love this line by dr. brandt so I bought
it and I'm gonna try it out today and
I'm only gonna spread this out on my
nose and on my chin area cuz in those
areas my pores are the largest ones with
a little bit of a tint goes very soft
oh holy baby Jesus that really I don't
know how but that like filled up all my
pores but still has it looking hydrated
instead of like normally when you use
creams like this it gets rid of the
pores but it always ends up looking so
dry and like dehydrated but this looks
just like your pores have disappeared oh
my god this is awesome for foundation
today I'm gonna go in with the Milani
two-in-one foundation and concealer
conceal perfect foundation and I'm in
the color 1 creamy vanilla now I really
really really like these they have
amazing cover
which they stay on beautifully my only
downfall with it is that it accidentally
so I'm going to mix it with a lighter
foundation and then I'm just going to
work it in using my beauty blender for
concealer I'm going to go in with the
Make Up For Ever Ultra HD concealer in
y21 and making it a little bit lighter
using my Kryolan TV paint stick and
double zero and again as always blend it
in using your Beauty Blender
and now baking using the NARS soft
velvet loose powder in snow all right
first thing you want to do as always is
prime and I'm going to use as always my
Mac soft ochre Paint Pot I'm applying
this using a sigma 3d HD brush my
favorite brush to apply my Paint Pot
with with this Kiko high pigment
eyeshadow in number one I'm going to set
my brow bone and crease area to help
lending later on the first eyeshadow be
going in with is by on the sauce Everly
Hills and this is in the color custard
and with a Mac 224 I'm just applying
that into the crease
now I'm going to go in with dis Anasazi
Beverly Hills eyeshadow in rosette and
this is going on the inner and outer
third and I'm using a Mac 239 for this
now going in with blazing also by
Anasazi bravely hills and with a Cosette
185 brush I'm gradually blending this
from the rosette color
and then anything that's left on the
brush you drag over the crease to get
some sort of connection going here but
keep it very soft you guys and then you
can always go back in with custard and
just slightly above blazing at that
warmth back in I'm going to Rhian ten
safai those inner and outer thirds using
rosette by Anasazi Beverly Hills again
and mixing it with beauty mark on the
center of the little be applying metal
by Anasazi Beverly Hills and doing so
using a Mac 242 but damp an over top
I'll be applying this gorgeous pressed
glitter by glitter injections and these
are best just patting them over top and
I'm putting them right over that metal
color and then for extreme payoff a
little bit using my pinky on the
waterline we'll be applying this makeup
geek full spectrum I pencil implementing
this onto the lash line
and now with my tweezerman align glider
brush and rosette only I'm going to buff
that in and on the inner corner I'll be
also applying an amazing glitter
injections glitter and I don't exactly
know the names but I'll put them down in
the description box and to finish off
this eye look all you want to do now is
apply some falsies and these are the
hood of beauty naomi's okay we're gonna
do it the crispy method again by just
looking straight forward and placing the
lashes from up top dropping the corners
off at their destination and they should
be on the time has come for you to cut
those cheeks okay now I'm gonna cut my
cheeks I'm gonna contour my cheeks using
my Kevyn Aucoin medium sculpting Edmond
sculpting powder mm-hmm and using my
favorite contouring brush by morpheme IM
five-thirty
and to make it really sharp and precise
i'm gonna go in with my face powder
which is my mac nw15
and my morphe m4 for four and with this
you can really cut the cheek and clean
it up this is sort of like baking
without the excessive amount of powder
but with the cleanup never bronzer I'm
going to use something that a subscriber
recommended for pale skin this is the
cover FX bronzer in sunkissed and it
looks like it will be amazing for fair
skin tones so I'll be applying that
using my Cosette number one brush and
just to kind of warm up the complexion
okay that is gorgeous oh my goodness
that truly warms up the face in such a
soft and delicate yet banging way I love
it thank you for recommending it for
blush I'm again going into the Ofra
blush palette because I really like it
imitation and for the color today I'm
going to go in with that one and that
one I'm using my Cosette number two
brush for this I'm just kind of wash it
up
and for highlighter of course moonstone
because it never lets me down
applying it using my morphe and 310
also doing my tip of the nose
take that haters and my Cupid's bow I
mean we focusing like those true I don't
know stripes going up okay now it's time
for lips and this is a little bit hard
for me because I feel like so many lip
options go with these eyes so I have a
bunch of options first I want it to go
with Requiem by Kat Von D mmm I love it
next option is setting cream by coloured
raine Bachelorette ooh got a rusty vibe
up in here soul makes it more edgy and
Marsh mellow mix it less edgy but still
edgy I can't
okay Breck weum I'm going to go for
Requiem by Kat Von D just because I feel
like it will make the look a little bit
more playful okay I'm making it a little
bit more nude using milkshake by Anasazi
I like it and that guy's concludes this
warm sexy smoky eyes and cool tone lips
