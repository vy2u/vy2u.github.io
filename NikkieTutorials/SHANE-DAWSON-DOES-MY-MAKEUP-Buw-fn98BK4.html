light bulb
Oh anything reviews I'm so just close
everything I'm truckin oh right Dottie
Dottie bar blotting so first what we're
gonna do is we're gonna blow it and
we're just gonna block all around the
face and cover all the imperfections
although there are perfect so we want
everything to look
the same color we we wanted all to be
like one shade yeah I've seen makeup
gurus do that where they like put it
like in random places mm-hmm I know
let's kind of stupid but then they were
like well if you had a makeup artist do
your makeup like on set for something
and they had an annoying kick like that
and you decided like four hours do you
know where concealer go mm-hmm oh and
some art queens get ready oh you did
that so well so this is just so that
everything looks concealed which is
where they get the name from make them
sorry contort powder / powder first

be fucked yeah this is this is a llama
