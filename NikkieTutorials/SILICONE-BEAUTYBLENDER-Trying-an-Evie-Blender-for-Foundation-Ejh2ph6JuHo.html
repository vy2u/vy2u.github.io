another review on a foundation Africa
nadir and this one I've actually seen
going around a lot of the internet it's
a silicon beauty blender all right all
right let's all gather our minds let's
get together imagine a beauty blender
like see it now try to see it in a
silicone version that's when you get
this this right here mmm that's why you
get so today I'll be doing a first
impressions and demo on just a little
sponge right here this right here is
called an easy blender and it's
basically it's basically a rubberized
silicone beauty blender now what makes
us different from the civil offense is
that this one actually has texture to it
the civil sponge is smooth and like
there isn't a dent in there and this one
actually has a lot of texture on there
it actually kind of looks like an old
granny skin it claims to perfectly blend
it is hypoallergenic silicone it won't
absorb makeup and it cleans easily and
no more shame okay now the easy blender
started off with a huge like Kickstarter
project and I actually donated money
into the project because I really wanted
to see this being realized they're
actually patent pending right now I
think I've donated around $60 to get two
of the sponges I haven't gotten those in
yet but the PR for the brand send me a
prototype so with the prototype one I
have here it has a sticker theme around
the center of the sponge all finished
and actual realized evie blenders won't
have this I just want to put that out
there a tip for application the e V
blender works best if you swipe on the
product and bounce to blend it cleans
with the makeup wipes soap and warm
water or a paper towel and rubbing
alcohol you know what I am super excited
I've heard a lot of things about these
so I cannot wait County on my face
alright alright so it doesn't say
anywhere that I need to you of course
you don't have to wet it Nikki get you
before we go in I like to it is 1:00 in
the morning right now so I'm not wearing
this anywhere but I do need a little bit
of like moisture so I'm gonna go in with
the Urban Decay b6 vitamin infused
complexion priming spray just to give my
like skin ready for the k-cup for our
foundation today I'm going to go in with
my fail-proof Lancome Lancome I would
say Lancome Patti dull 24-hour makeup
and I'm in the color 100 ivory neutral
this is quickly becoming my like holy
grill because it's like so long wearing
yet it still makes me look like a more
natural pancake and supposed to like a
case of pancake with like all the extras
on it all right here we go the ebee
blender I'm going to dip it into my
foundation and like I said first well
it's got a little like dent here so I'm
thinking it's intended for your finger
to go in there right so I picked some
fantastics a lot of foundation up and
we're going to swipe it in first that's
a lot can we evenly distribute oh no we
cannot
okay we're swiping it and okay we're
swiping the foundation and this feels
very soothing okay okay and then bounce
to blend bounce to blend so immediately
what I'm noticing is that it is making
my foundations super max like the
Lancome 24-hour makeup one is known to
be kind of matte but it starts to have
super luminous and like healthy but
right up the bat applying it with the
sponge it turns Mac I'm also losing
quite a bit of coverage as opposed to a
regular sponge nothing like where I'm
like oh my god like where's my coverage
but like I can notice that it's like
less than 10 oh the sponge looks gross
right now look at that
oh my god okay let's grab a little bit
more for the other set swipe it on
slightly slightly okay okay and then now
let's start bouncing to blend so like
you would with any other like beauty
sponge like you tap it in kind of harsh
tapping it into the skin it kind of it's
a little harsh on the skin it's like
what really feels like you're stuffing
your face with a dildo it is
transforming the foundation in something
oh how do people do it how do people
have their brows done and go on with
foundation after and not mess anything
up it's I cannot get that down how do
people do that so I will say that I
missed a little bit of preciseness with
it because it's like a lump of silicone
I don't know I'm looking really dry like
my face is looking a little dehydrated
it could use some moisture I mean
usually this foundation makes me look a
plus like this foundation makes me look
like an a-list celebrity and right now
like my flaws are coming through my
redness is coming through and I never
have that issue using the Sigma blender
or a beauty blender or I'm not sold on
this yeah I like it all honesty I feel
like when these like weird sponges come
out people use it for a week and then
they're like it won't let me go back to
the beauty boner because that was the
life I always feel like these trip but
they're like trends like these
applicators last for like a week and
they get really popular and then they
die down and everyone's like it's so
good to be back with my Beauty Blender
you know what I'm saying
I feel like there isn't a lot that can
beat the finish and the beauty of a
Beauty Blender but let's keep going all
right so let me go in with some
concealer okay let's cancel the forehead
because I cannot deal with like messing
up my brows oh my god it makes anything
I put on my face looks so dry and
dehydrated
and why is it good for the texture it
looks disgusting is it because of the
texture that looks like a crusty toe
ours way too hard on design makeup to
mess this face up so you better pull
okay under-eye we have arrived oh my god
you guys my face is not having it I look
dry crusty and like it's not even
blending the concealer in because it's
making it so dry what the concealer
hasn't dried up yet and like as soon as
I touch it with the sponge it like makes
it dry it's so weird
I've worked way too hard on these brows
at 1:00 in the morning to deserve this I
wanted to bake using this sponge but you
know what I'm going to do I'm going to
rinse my Beauty Blender and try to save
this alright so I washed my Sigma
Blender sponge and some sticks plus I'm
going to try and reactivate like the the
concealer and like foundation because I
need to save this it's so weird because
it's like whatever the sponge touches it
grabs all the oils from it and like
makes it dry so I'm thinking that this
actually might be amazing for oily skin
because you know you want that madness
and that longevity or like when you have
dry skin like me I feel like it's too
much and like there's too much texture
on that sponge so let me see if I can go
in with my okay so I just make any more
I might be doomed here ya know that ya
know that foundation is like caked on
it's like dried in and kcon like it
won't move
so that again tells me that this might
be amazing for oily skin I think I'm
going to have to remove my foundation
start over with my face makeup
then give you my final thoughts all
right so I finished you my makeup and I
am so glad that the Sigma sponge was
there to save me after I took it all off
and did it again so what do I think
about the Eevee blender I am NOT a fan I
am honestly I'm really disappointed I
had really high hopes for this because
with the sillas punch I was like it's
too smooth for like you know to fall in
love with it
so when I saw that this actually had
texture that made me so happy because I
think that is I think that's a really
innovative like smart idea but like I
feel like this one has too much texture
like I said before it is whenever the
sponge touches product it's like it's
soaking up all the moisture and makes it
matte so for me and my dry skin this is
an absolute no-go but I can imagine when
you have oily skin that this is amazing
for that so unfortunately the Eevee
blender did not break the internet for
me to break my skin existence it was it
was it was not a fun experience for me
like I'm so sorry what do you think of
the ebee blender and let me know in the
comment section down below
if you think it would work for your skin
type as always if you enjoyed watching
this video then please don't forget to
give it a thumbs up and subscribe to my
channel I want to thank you so so so
much for watching and going through this
with me and yeah I hope that the next
big foundation applicator trend is going
to be a little bit better for my skin
type in my needs so there's so much I
love you and hopefully I will see you
guys on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
