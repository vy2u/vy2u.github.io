on this crazy look right here crazy I
came up with this look for like all the
festivals that are coming up like
Coachella that's the old accessible I
know in this stage so like Coachella and
I wanted to create something very
festive and like glittery and
rhinestones because I feel like everyone
that festivals is like glitter
rhinestones everywhere of the face now
of course if you find the lower lashes a
little bit too much you can always leave
that kind you can add more to your
face you can do more to your lips you
can do what it feels like lip rings with
liquid lipstick that I see everyone
doing right now see how the
possibilities are endless and this is
just my take and yeah I hope you like so
without any further ado if you would
like to know how to get this look right
here then keep on watching alright so
the first thing I'm doing is / rhyming
with a way too expensive primer now I've
talked about this I think it's
ridiculous that it has this price work
for foundation today I'm going to mix my
q favorite my Lancome tat idole ultra
24-hour makeup in 100 ivory neutral and
the SI water Double Wear in one and one
and I'm applying it using my Beauty
Blender
okay I'm about to say something really
crazy but for the last month I've been
using the Sigma blender B sponge and
I've got really used to like the texture
and like the bounce of it and it is
quite a lot softer than an original
beauty blender and now working with an
actual Beauty Blender again is so weird
like it changes the texture of my
foundation it absorbs a little bit more
product than the Sigma sponge so after a
month of like religiously using and like
full dedication to my Sigma sponge going
back to an actual Beauty Blender it's
crazy it's like I can actually see and
feel the difference compared to the
Sigma sponge so I might go back to that
in the next video also did we spot that
little tail lie right there come on
Necker Island
I never tan like I am as white as paper
I pretty much when I go out in the Sun I
burn because I'm a vampire no I just
nothing happens well something happens I
burn I get red I become a lobster but on
nicker Island
I was out in the Sun one day the rest of
the trip was pretty cloudy and I got a
tan it started red I mean it started red
but I do have a little bit of a tan line
right now and I feel some type of way
about it I like especially my mom loves
it when I have a little bit of a tan and
when I got back from Necker Island she
was like yes I'm so proud of you I'm
like mom it's a tan also on Friday I
want to upload an extra video where I
show you how to do like the
longest-lasting base ever and I'll also
share my setting spray trick with you in
that video so definitely we know if that
is something that you want for me to do
on Friday because I believe Coachella is
this weekend so if I get that video up
on Friday maybe it can help some people
with Coachella keeping their foundation
on all day so let me know now with my
finger blender I'm going to be
my under-eye area just go in with the
primers of all primers and Mac soft
ochre Paint Pot as a transition color my
crease I first gonna go in with this
greyish nude color and what does for
softly placing that transition shade
that is going to make everything look
more blended and precise later on and
then at the end of every application I
go in with a clean a blending brush to
smooth out the edges now I'm going to go
in with this grayish brown color and
this to deepen the crease a little bit
more
and again going back in with that clean
blending brush to smooth out the edges
going in with this darker purple a
neutral brownish grayish I don't know
what to describe this color to deepen
the crease even more now going to go in
with the NYX white eyeliner and with
this I'm going to cut my lid and
essentially the crease as well and this
will determine where our Y crease line
will go to so I'm picking it up on a
very tiny brush and a little by little I
just map out where I won't be line to be
kind of sketch it out and since I have
hooded eyelids and I like for this line
to still be visible when I look up I go
a little bit above my natural crease
then about two quarters of the way in
dip down and dip back out again it's the
only way I can explain it so take the
curve of that crease line a little bit
more down to your actual lid and then
scoop it out and up now I'm going to go
in with the NYX glitter primer and with
this I'm mapping out where I want my
glittery silver lid to go to so with the
brush first map out the shape of where
you want the silver glare to go to and
leave some space for a white line in the
crease that's what we did all this work
for and then go ahead and pack the
silver glitter on
now with mixes white liquid liner I'm
going to intensify that line and sharpen
it up a little bit more so just you know
softly glide over that line to get it
nice and precise going back into that
perfectly dark grayish brown color from
the crease and applying this to the
lower lash line and then leaving a
little gap do you apply some white
liquid liner after to open up the eyes
more and on is a wave a three to five
brush I'm just going to smoke and blur
that out a little bit more using the
same color a little bit of white coal on
the waterline and then now I open up the
inner corners using the white liquid
liner by NYX
it's time for some falsies I'm going to
apply these flow their lashes in Natalie
on my top lashes now for the thumb part
the lower lashline i'm going in with
three silver rhinestones i make up
forevers followed by three of these
little cluster lashes by urban decay to
spice up the lower lash line and make it
a little bit more unique so first I go
in with a little bit of glue and follow
with the rhinestone and the lash this of
course is inspired by one of my favorite
Queens on RuPaul's Drag Race Season 9
pheromone the first thing I'm going to
do for my cheeks is we're going to go to
a festival so we want to look bronzed
don't like hello there so I'm going to
go in with my hula life and the hula
brush by benefit and we're just going to
grab this and literally warm up this
complexion because I might have to
analyze but my face still ago
now a little bit of additional
contouring because I like to be sculpted
as the genie Pajama putting up a jenna
fudge for blush I'm again using the
kylie blush inherently legal the name is
plenty but the color is stunning
now forego of course I'm going to go in
with ever glow you want to blend
everyone at that festival you want to
blind the artists you want to blend them
all now sadly the collaboration with
Oprah was out of stock it is now sold
out but I am trying my hardest
I'm begging upper management at Oprah to
bring back all the items individually I
have no idea if I can pull this off but
a lot of you guys have asked for this
and of course I want to make this happen
for you so I'm trying my hardest
I'm really trying fingers crossed and
let's hope it works but I'm going to go
in with the lightest color and a little
bit of the medium shade on this morphe
r-36
- blind let's go weird when I do my glow
I get so excited and I get tingles on my
inside I'm telling you guys ever glow
and never gets boring like
now for lips I feel like the eyes are so
intense you can pretty much do whatever
you want
usually I would go like you want to keep
it nude but you're at a festival and
people have like the craziest going
on on their eyes and legs face like
everything so you can go with a nude
with a pink with a red even like a
brownish color like that crease that
would be nice I'm just going to keep it
more on the neutral side so I'm going to
go back in with that color sensational
lip liner by Maybelline in 105 a nude
whisper I really really like this in the
previous video that I did so we're going
to go back with it and then to finish
I'm going to go in with the nude Kate
Charlotte Tilbury
lipstick
like that so of course you want to set
your face because you want this to last
and then again in Friday's video I will
show you all the tips and tricks to
setting your face with a setting spray
I'm just going to keep it normal for now
