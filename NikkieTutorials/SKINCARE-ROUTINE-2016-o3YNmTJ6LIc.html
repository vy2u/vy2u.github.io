that has been so requested lately and
just so many people asked for this and
even when I did my 2015 tapas and God
knows people were like but where's the
skincare so I figured today would be the
perfect day to share with you my
favorite skincare products and
everything I do to get my skin in the in
the state that it's in first and
foremost I do feel like I need to do a
little bit of a disclaimer that I pay a
lot of money and pay a lot of attention
to my skin because I feel like when your
skin is on point your makeup will look
on point and your pictures and selfies
and wherever you may be will look on
point
I think skincare is so important and I
don't mind paying more money for it
because if I know that the product may
be a little bit more expensive but it
does what it should be doing I'm okay
with that so before I get any common
saying oh my gosh this is worth over so
many dollars or Euros I know and I'm
okay with that because I'm willing to
pay the price for better looking skin I
should also probably tell you that I
have combination skin on my t-zone
I am oily and everything Ram not oily
I'm super dry and I mainly get super dry
around my eyes like directly next to my
eyes is so dry and around the corners of
my mouth basically the outer perimeter
of my face is dry and the inner
perimeter is oily so throughout the
years I've tried so many products and
I've had so many habits and I finally
feel like I found my regimen that works
for me because my skin has been pretty
good lately
and sometimes you will see a lot of red
spots and whatever on my face in a video
and that is because I'm a picker I
picked my face a lot and I have a bad
habit of picking my face before I film a
tutorial because I feel like it gets rid
of all the nasty bumps before a tutorial
but then what happens is I get all these
red spots on my face and then people
think I have horrible skin which
actually I'm pretty happy with my skin
and I'm okay with my skin and I think my
skin looks pretty good but I'm a picker
and especially before filming tutorials
so if you ever see a lot of red spots I
just picked all right so let's jump into
the products and let's get started so
the first product I absolutely swear by
is this right here by tyro
and this is called their double phase
makeup remover and I swear to you guys
this is the only stuff that will get my
hardcore eye makeup off in seconds it
removes glitter eyeliner but the best of
them has the flashes eyelash glue and if
you have House of lashes eyelash glue
you know exactly what I'm talking about
so this just gets my eyes completely
clean and I just used to come Pat's I'm
working into the eyes and when I'm
wearing liquid lipstick and it's really
hardcore I also use this to get it off
because this will get anything off so
any remover that has to blue stuff and
it will probably work for you although I
have noticed that with some they burn a
lot and they really irritate the eyes
and if you like with this one it doesn't
make your vision blurry it doesn't
irritate the skin around it and
especially because I'm so dry around my
eyes I want it to be super gentle so
this works amazing for that and I
absolutely love this I swear by this and
this is my holy girl I makeup remover my
favorite face makeup remover is by bozhe
and this is the makeup breakup cool
cleansing oil and I got into this
because so many people recommended it on
Twitter so I looked into it I ordered it
and tried it and it's the best oil to
get your makeup off with on planet earth
it will just break down the makeup in
just a couple of seconds so you just
massage it into the skin and then I like
to add some water to really break down
that product then wash my face wash
everything off all the cool cleansing
oil all the Tyros stuff just wash my
entire face and then Pat my face a
little bit more dry and then I like to
go back in with boscia and do it another
round to really get everything clean
rinse off with water again and then I
know that my entire cake face for the
day is gone now of course I wear a lot
of makeup and especially in front of
these cameras I feel like it can always
go a little bit more than in real life
so when I'm on camera I polish it on I
pile that makeup on and I think it looks
fabulous
so sometimes the cool cleansing oil by
bozhe does get everything off but I
really want to make sure that my pores
are SuperDuper clean that's what I like
to go in with the olavo skin rebirth
cleanser and this is a special cleanser
that has assets in it that really
cleanse your pores so I only use this
two times a week so whenever I feel like
I've worn so much makeup that day that I
just feel like my pores need that extra
a little bit of lovin I guess a skin
rebirth cleanser to really get my pores
clean and to really you know get that
makeup out and that doesn't mean I skip
on this it's just an extra additional
step okay then I wash my face with water
and then it's time to tone to get your
pH levels back to neutral and to get
your face ready for moisturizing my
favorite toner at this point is by bosha
and this is the balancing facial tonic
and I switched toners a lot so I'm not
going to say this is my Holy Grail
because I actually ordered a new one a
couple of days ago and I'm waiting for
that to come in but I feel like so far
this toner has been doing a great job
and it's not if you know I have that
skin rebirth to really cleanse my pores
and I feel like toners are just great to
get that extra fresh feel so we've taken
all that makeup off we have toned and
it's now time to moisturize the first
moisturizer I go in with then is by Hana
and this is their first aid defense
cream and don't ask me what's in this
one I feel like this clears up my skin
even more I just feel like it really
adds that layer of taking care of your
skin but still helps it get clear and
clean I don't have a lot of stay about
it just that if I do not use this in my
regimen in my routine I notice because I
find my skin not looking as clear and
healthy and when I do use this it's just
it's right it's right after that I like
to go in with an oil this is viola bow
as well and this is their essential
cocktail oil in renewing I know they
have three types of the essential
cocktails and this one is renewing and I
find that this just really helps lock in
that moisture and give me that nice baby
but soft skin and I especially like to
use this on my dry areas to really lock
in that moisture and to get a little bit
of extra moisture where I need it after
that it's time
another moisturizer I pile on the
moisturizer and this one is also by
Boscia and as you can tell I'm an alibi
boscia
hooker this is the boscia supercharged
overnight moisture this just gives your
skin that XR boost a baby but soft skin
it just gives you so much moisture and
it feels a little bit greasy but the
morning after when you wake up your skin
feels so soft so soft it's almost my
favorite moisturizer but my favorite
like my top top top a for moisturizer is
the one I'm about to show you my top top
favorite facial cream slash moisturizer
is vile a beau and this is the truffle
indulgence cream and it smells like
truffles I'm telling you if I did not
have the truffle indulgence cream I
would be so sad in life because this
just does the most for my skin it just
makes my skin super soft super clear
super moisturized nourished just perfect
just perfect when I'm telling you you
need a little bit of truffle indulgence
in your life please trust me because it
is so amazing whenever friends are over
or back in Mexico I I like gave this to
the team to try out and everyone the
morning after was like my skin feels
amazing and it smelled so good this just
feels like a truffle infused dream I'm
trying to think of ways to tell you how
amazing this is because it's so it's the
bomb it's fire it's hot fire not
lukewarm fire it's hot fire if I could
absolutely only recommend you one
moisturizer to get after this video get
truffle indulgence because I do not know
if they ship internationally though so I
might be I might be hurting you really
bad right now those are all the products
I used to cleanse tone and moisturize
now concerning taking extra care of your
skin there are masks and scrubs and
whatever you have that it is and my
absolute favorite mask to get my skin
SuperDuper clear is by glam glow and
this is the super mud clearing treatment
and I'm telling you this is the only
mask that will get my skin look
poor free this mask is dark gray and it
dries into a light charcoal gray and
once it starts drying it will see all
these spots and all these dots that you
will see on your skin are your pores
your pores that are getting sucked clean
and I like to leave this mask on for at
least 30 minutes to really suck all the
nasty stuff out if you do a lot of
traveling and your a lot in planes
planes and pores do not go together
I feel like whenever I'm on a plane
flight that is more than two hours my
pores just open just BAM like you can
walk into my pores that's how big they
are so after every long flight I want to
get back to the hotel this will go on my
face to give myself poor closed and
looking fresh and clean now as far as a
mask that really brings back the
moisture and brings back the softness to
my skin I really like this one bio lab
oh and guess what this is the truffle
indulgence mask so that amazing
moisturizer the truffle indulgence cream
they also have it in a mask
I just slather this onto my face put
like a really like a really good thick
layer on there keep it on for at least
like an hour to really lock in that
moisture and to give my face a baby blot
soft skin it makes it feel so soft so
Norrish so so to clear my pores glam
glow super mud and to nourish the face
and give it back the moisture that it
deserves a la beau truffle indulgence
masque and that's it those are all the
products I love using for my skincare
that is my skincare routine that is my
skincare holy grail regimen and again I
know I use a lot of products please
don't give me any hate for that because
I will not change it and it works for me
it doesn't have to work for you every
skin is different some people totally
react super different to whatever
product I may recommend but this is what
works for me and throughout the years
I've experienced that this routine works
for my face and I think that's also why
I haven't done a skincare routine and
still along an updated one because skin
is so personal
I'm just sharing what I'm using because
a lot of people want to know but I'm not
saying that this will work for everyone
because every skin is different
