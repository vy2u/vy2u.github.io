doing a snapchat Q&amp;amp;A today don't even
know how to open them on snapchat we
asked you to send in your video
questions so then we can answer them
live here on camera and you can see your
pretty face back on here it's like
Inception
and then we answer your questions so
that's all we're going to do today and I
thought let's go what if they're
offensive
do I still answer them you're offensive
back to them
let's see you're not talking
you have to dog you're not talking
either why am I not hearing you I think
she said something along the line I like
matter favorite and makeup products ever
what's your all-time favorite make it
put it ever I didn't bring it with me
right now but that would probably be the
Nivea men aftershave balm really right
now either it's the best primer ever
it contains the second most used
ingredient in it is glycerin and
anything you put over top of glycerin
makes it stick so if you use the
aftershave balm as the primer makeup
stays on all day
really and I would everything she's a
beauty genius whole credit for without
my favorite makeup product ever I read
your last show da I actually like a good
foundation I have a hard time finding
good foundation I love Buddha is just
like me we love our cupboard yes Vulcano
we're like mask it off do you know one
of my favorite foundations is the
graftobian really I love it yes
looks so good over to them yes full
coverage seriously it's like when you
take it off it's like taking off that
feeling of that honey ha ha Nia
underscore Sharif said how do you think
a 16 year old should wear makeup for
makeup because I love love makeup I
don't want to look like I'm trying too
hard on too old for my age it's a
devotion yeah that's a really good one

at me I started when I was 14 with I
feel like when you're younger try to
give it fresh show your skin show your
MA
Brow's don't pluck your Ramos yeah don't
click around and for the worst hey I
feel like yeah I just keep it friend
yeah I just do everything work on back
glow just glow it up yeah blow it up and
maybe save me from like harsh lines like
that maybe you don't do like too much
lip liner or like or don't contour too
much I mean you're 60 yeah a whole
nother life you know we're using yes you
do oh well she's you you know what
really keeps me motivated the people who
leave supportive comments you know you
have the haters but the people who take
their times out of their day to tell you
how much they love your work and how
much they love you that means so much to
me and that really keeps me going and
then also I have a really nice
supportive boyfriend keeps me going back
being together it really keeps me on
track so I feel like the people who show
you their love is what I'm here for I
love it so good it's nice - underrated

mm-hmm I use your it's always too dark
for me yeah yeah their foundations can
be dark
I like this is the original Makeup
Forever HD - did you try that no I like
that one too the hard stuff in my beauty
industry I really want to do I don't
know where to start
I'm also a big fan of you guys so I
really like to know where you start up
because I idols oh oh so how did you
start out uh I actually start blogging
like five years ago yeah are you started
that's how sorry I was blogging yeah I
wasn't really doing too much of a
YouTube thing I was just blogging and
then we kind of created products out of
that and I think that's kind of what
helped us so that's kind of how we
started I think we kind of saw like
where we wanted to go and we just focus
on that and that's kind of how happened
okay so last question for me there we go
okay
actually I am so planning to come to
Australia and then when I'm in Australia
I actually want to do New Zealand as
well and fun thing about it is when you
want to go to Australia you have to come
to Dubai so I'm gonna make you do yeah
oh my gosh so we're gonna have her here
again I'm gonna like make sure that she
stays with me and like I'm gonna kidnap
her and we're going to so much totally
yeah I'm free
okay last question for me my question is
what is the best way to cover pimples
for a neck for a day night out from
normal stuff on my night I always think
people just do it afterwards like do
your makeup and then just
like cover the pimple afterwards because
you maybe if it's an area where you the
contour maybe to mix it a little bit
yeah yes to do it I don't do it while
you're doing the makeup do it afterwards
I also feel like if it's a really bad
one you can who concealer on first then
powder it and then put concealer on
again over top and then powder it yeah
yes okay kkap there's Katie can
pancaking they're all necessary in the
world of unique
alright cool oh we hope you guys enjoyed
