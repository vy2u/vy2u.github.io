be super fun to do a snapchat question
and answer video I've seen Amanda do
this I've seen Gigi do this I've seen
desi do this so I felt so inspired to do
this because I loved watching their
videos doing these snapchat Q&amp;amp;A so I
thought why not ask everyone to do the
same with me so I posted this video on
snapchat this morning guys I'm doing a
snapchat Q&amp;amp;A later today so please send
your questions through a video here of
snapchat and maybe you'll see yourself
in my video I look so different so a
bunch of you did actually send in your
question so let's just go right ahead to
the first one and let's answer this
stuff what's your favorite string you do
besides makeup my favorite thing to do
besides doing makeup is hanging out with
my friends and family I am probably one
of the most biggest fanatics of going to
the movie theaters I love watching
movies with my friends especially when
they just came out in theaters also I
just ordered a Nintendo 3ds extra large
with Pokemon and I can't wait for that
to come in because I know that will be
my next obsession because I played it
till it died as a kid I was wondering if
you've ever used any of the unique brand
products the 3d fiber mascara the eye
shadows any of those and what you think
I have never tried the unique products
because I I don't like the way they are
marketing their brand it's like they get
all these girls to harass almost these
beauty gurus or whoever they encounter
on the internet and I'm just like no too
much I just don't believe in their way
of showing their brand to the public and
it almost leaves a bitter taste in my
mouth because it just feels to pusher II
so no I won't try it I want to try it I
don't want to try it high school what
what did you say
so so so much um my question is if you
were to have a day dedicated to yourself
what would it be love you a day
dedicated to myself gosh the day
dedicated to me would probably not be on
my birthday because I feel like that
would just beat you unoriginal I
probably go for somewhere the sixteenth
of a month because I really liked the
number sixteen I'm so probably like in
summer so June sixteenth would be
nikkietutorials day hi Niki I want to
ask you have you ever thought Oh doing
videos in your native language I I I get
this question all the time if I will do
videos in Dutch and I will not because
when I started out doing my YouTube
videos I was inspired by so many
American gurus that from day one I
wanted to be like my idols like those
American beauty gurus and to be honest I
get this question on a daily basis but
for now I do not feel like it is gonna
happen in the near future but who knows
maybe in the later future thank you so
much I am not damn beautiful there is
there is a lot of stuff happening here
and I did wake up like this I love
Germany you're gorgeous
oh yes work that girl I don't know it
just kind of with the powers make up the
the fame kind of really started to roll
I do not feel famous I do not think I'm
famous whenever people say I'm famous
I'm like no bitch no I'm not famous it's
so much fun to just note that the
community of my channel has become so
much bigger and it's just so crazy to
know that so many people are watching my
videos nowadays and I do not feel famous
I don't think I'm famous and so I don't
know how to become famous all I can tell
you is to just be yourself love yourself
stay true to yourself and just make fun
videos okay next one you'll
why aren't you talking why does the text
Oh
what is your Holy Grail makeup item that
you can't live without oh oh let me tell
is there more is there more
what was that it Oh first more I love
you too
oh there's so much action in the
snapchats my favorite product that I
cannot live without is my Nivea men
aftershave balm insensitive I've talked
about this so many times but this truly
is the best primer you could ever think
of if you don't know this aftershave
long contains a lot of glycerin and
glycerin makes stuff stick to it so if
you put this on as your base and put
your makeup on over top the glycerin
will really stick onto the makeup making
it lasts all day long and so this is the
best makeup primer you could ever wish
for and with that this my makeup slides
off in a couple of hours and with this
it just stays on all day long looking
flawless and beautiful and I've left
this stuff Heinicke how do you get
makeup from America because I live in a
nylon stew and it's kind of hard to get
makeup from America because the shipping
costs are so high and by the way I love
watching your videos and I've got to set
it up right thank you I love your brows
sometimes it can be really difficult to
get products from the US the states to
another country so first and foremost
whenever you want to order from a
website that is us located make sure in
the shipping policy that they do ship to
you know international addresses I of
course I'm a little bit privileged
because I'm a youtuber and I work with
be are lots of times brands in the US
send me a PR care package so I get the
products even though I do not live in
the States so I'm privileged in that but
I know from Shannon that there are so
many websites that you can use and they
ship it to that website and that website
ships it to you I do not know the names
of these websites but you definitely
have to do some research but there are a
couple of websites that can take like a
us-only website take their order and
send that order to you
I was wondering I've got four children
my anguses three months
and I tend to get dark circles do you
have any advice for person of my skin
type so for women of color it can be a
little bit harder to counteract the
darkness so my number one trick is
warmth first warm that darkness up with
a warm toned orange maybe lipstick
concealer whatever you have laying
around I personally recommend a lady
danger lipstick by Mac you just put that
on the darkest first set it with powder
then go over top with your regular
concealer and then blend it in and set
it and the darkness should be gone
without it making it look ashy who is
your favorite Disney Princess my
favorite Disney Princess
always and forever will be Mulan that
bitch was fierce yes Emma Shu I love to
Mushu a Nakia we just want to ask you if
you ever want to have a baby sometime a
girl oh that is such a tough question as
of right now I do not think that I'm a
person to have children because I love
other people's children but I don't see
myself becoming a mother then again I
love other people's babies and I like it
for like I like that for a day but not
for a lifetime I'd rather be an awesome
you know
auntie auntie I don't know what you say
a lot I'd rather be awesome auntie Nikki
for a day and not be mom for the rest of
my life and I know a lot of people might
not agree with that
it's just I'm like Carrie in Sex in the
City I just do not see children for me
working
any woman brands that you recommend so
some most videos you use high-end burn
makeup so low-end brands that I
absolutely adore are Milani
I mean luminoso is my child I don't want
to have any children but luminoso is my
child so there definitely are a couple
of low-end brands that I really love I
just did not show them in my tutorials
as much and I definitely have to change
that around because I realize now that
not everyone can always buy my high-end
stuff so I'm working on it
sorry I'm in bed I just woke up but what
would be your favorite liquid lipstick
brand like of all time well good morning
to you first of all so my favorite
liquid lipstick brand
I have tried almost all of them and I am
not sponsored in any way I'm not even
affiliated with the brand but honest
Saskia Beverly Hills
makes the best liquid lipsticks of the
entire market I feel like with anasazi
Beverly Hills the lipsticks are not
drying they say actually they actually
stay on like like like oh my god they do
not crack
they do not crumble like I have tried so
many liquid lipsticks throughout these
last couple of months and the best one
by far for me are by Anastasia Beverly
Hills and that's my honest opinion okay
I'm from Brazil
oh absolutely love you thank you and I
was wondering if you may do one come to
Brazil sometime of course I would have
come to Brazil I did not even know that
I have so many subscribers in Brazil you
have analytics for your YouTube page and
my number one most view country is the
States but on number four is Brazil and
that just blows my mind because Brazil
has all these beautiful voluptuous women
with this beautiful asses and boobs and
everything and I'm like why
with that beautiful ten you have are you
watching Casper the Friendly Ghost right
here last one for today and I just want
to know if someday you can see my video
with your boyfriend like my boyfriend
does not make
zag or deploy frente who you I know it's
so hard to get Rick in front of the
camera we have been together for two and
a half years now and we're getting the
key to our apartment next week but so
far in those two and a half years I
could not have you know convinced him to
come in front of the camera it is a
miracle when he lets me snapchat him so
if you follow me here on snapchats you
will have seen his face a couple of
times but overall he will not jump in
front of a camera he is more of the I'm
staying behind it I'm the fourth behind
the camera and it's so hard to get him
in front of the camera though I'm
definitely trying to get him in front of
the camera but I feel like if he really
doesn't feel like doing it I have to
respect his decision and I will not push
it too far so yes I'll keep trying I'll
keep trying to convince him to do a
boyfriend does my makeup tag or a
boyfriend tag but I will not push him to
the limit so let's just wait it out see
what he will do in the next couple of
months once we have her apartment and
you know he sees me filming all this
everyday and then maybe one day we'll
get lucky so that guys were all the
questions from my snapchat today if I
missed any I definitely want to do these
more often these were so much fun to do
so yeah just follow me a snapchat that
is nikkietutorials and then keep an eye
out for when I post a video again for a
question and answer video here on
YouTube so thank you so much for
