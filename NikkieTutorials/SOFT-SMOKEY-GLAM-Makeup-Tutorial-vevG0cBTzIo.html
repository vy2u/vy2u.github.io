time to go down hello people hey guys
today I'm doing a tutorial well so
here's the thing a couple of days ago I
had a little help from someone in a
certain feature of my face and I hadn't
got that help done in about a year now
so I felt like it was time for some more
help against and usually when I get that
help that I need
it only takes two to three days for
swelling to go down but mama I'm still
looking like Kris Jenner on that
vacation I am aware of the fact that it
is pretty intense I feel like a Blowfish
but a cute one because I got my glam on
so today that inspired me to do a Kris
Jenner inspired makeup tutorial I'm just
really excited I really love Chris's
makeup it just looks so sophisticated
and glam and it's a little bit more
mature which I love this is just a fun
video where I try to make the best of my
face as much as I can alright guys the
first thing I'm going to use today is by
Becca it is called the first light
priming filter they recently launched it
and this helps making you look more
awake it perks up dull skin I heard very
very good things about it so I'm going
to prime with it today over feels really
nice oh my god it smells like lemon and
I love lemon oh good alright now going
to follow through using this Urban Decay
quick fix Hydra charge complexion prep
priming spray try to try seeing that
after one use
okey-dokey and now let's get glammed so
I was watching
Tapia's video where James Charles did
her makeup and James started off by
applying concealer to the nose areas
first because he felt like once you went
in with the nose contour it kind of
rubbed away all the foundation
I know I've never talked about this but
this is the main reason why sometimes I
have a beautiful nose contour and
sometimes I just don't even try because
most of the times when I go in with that
brush and I contour my nose it's gone
like it has disrupted the base it is
patchy messy it's got holes in it it's
not a cute look and when I heard James
say that I was like oh my god that's
what I have so I am so excited to try a
set me today his technique as I'm
putting down a layer of concealer first
so that when the foundation does rub
away you still have a layer of concealer
having yo Batgirl I'm going to go in
with the makeup forever camouflage
palette and I'm probably mixing these
two shades right here on a sigma p88
brush it's just focusing on the nose
all right for foundation today I'm going
to go in with the hourglass foundation
stick this one is in the color alabaster
and I've seen this going I look nose
less and I've seen this really blow up
on YouTube lately and I think believe it
or not every time I've useless I used
too little because so far I liked it but
I wasn't blown away by it
but I've seen other people use a little
bit more believe it or not than I do and
so I want to give it another girl
because people love this foundation and
I will get him crazy right now
I call it Ark and then with my over at
little Blender sponge I'm going to bust
a solid and then every time I feel like
my sponge gets a little too dry I hop in
with my avian spray and spritz spritz
spritz I love this stuff
I'm already starting to like the finish
of the foundation way more now that I
use a little bit more so see sometimes
less is not better more is better or oh
my god I can't get over that how big my
lives all right now it's time for some
concealer I'm going to go for my
favorite art shave tape I know you're
going to sick and tired of every guru on
the Internet it's talking about this but
babies it is like I'm shook by the
courage of that power glass stick like
it is no joke
and as he'll lock it into place and the
Senate using mine ARF loose powder in
snow for the creature first going into
the brand-spanking-new a royal peach
pallid by Kylie cosmetics and going in
with the color stir base burst and with
a bigger blending brush I'm just softly
defining the outer portion of my crease
now going in with the color sandy to
define the outer V even more and I'm
using this Kylee blending brush for it
that came with the royal peach palette
so serves I'm laying down the color on
this outer portion of my lid right here
and softly start using circular motions
to buff it in one of our level you can
start adding more of that shadow to work
your way up into the outer V and crease
now Christmas definition usually lies
within her lashline and the outer
corners so really try focusing on that
for your look hopping over to one of my
all-time favorite palettes by G way I'm
going into this color right here to to
find that outer portion of the eye even
more and of course you can go as dark
and intense as you like Christmas to go
ham or soft so I'm definitely going for
the ham one today
okay now that we've really built focus
on that outer portion here it's time to
focus on the lid give it some love from
that same g-way palette I'm going to use
this color right here for the lid I
think this color is the perfect crisp
color because it is glam and it has
shine but it is nothing over intense or
dramatic you want to meet that color
right up against the brown that we
applied earlier for that extra bit of
Juche I'm going to take this starlet
powder by Makeup Forever and applying
this to the center of the lid only and
this can be applied super crazy intense
but when you use a thin light layer it
just catches the light beautiful Eunice
back into the shoe a pallet and taking
that chocolate dark brown and with an
angled brush and the smoke of my lash
line this is really going to give you
the Christian or soft smokiness
and intensifying that some more using
black like that the perfect amount of
smoke for the lower lash I'm going back
into Joey's cast a shadow and placing
that all the way from the outer to inner
corner and that was the smaller blending
brush I'm softly smoking that out on the
waterline I'm applying a little bit of
jus a cream eyeshadow crayon in Barack's
this is stunning on the waterline and
lastly a highlighting the inner corners
just a tiny bit time to wrap up these
eyes in some lashes these are the new
bouncing Bombay lashes and of course no
dinner look is completed without a ton
of lower lash line mascara
hmmm the glam is starting to come on and
I feel way better this cold can suck my
left toe so great
what another to do is contour and we all
know that the Jenners and the
Kardashians love their contour so today
I'm going to go into my makeup geek
contour palette and I'm going to go in
with these two colors right here they're
the two lightest colors and for my brush
I'll be using this one by Sigma this is
the s 90 and basically I'm just going to
tap it in both the colors lightly only
need a little bit and cut that cheek now
I actually want to try something
I feel like this Sigma one is almost too
soft to do contour with and the morphe
you want is the hairs of the brush
aren't necessarily drier but I like the
texture of this I think a little bit
more so I'm going to do the other side
with the morphe one yeah the morphe one
just gets it on a little easier and
faster and it's easier to blend the
contour out using the morphe one so if
you want to use a large fan brush for
contouring I definitely recommend the
more few ones all right now for a nose
contouring moment of truth moment of
truth
I really hope James trick works for me
as well I'm going to go in with this
dose of colors a shader brush and a hope
and pray I always like to contour it
right here we're going to zod we're
still on for it here to give you a
little bit more of a button know
something about a little much I know
and then also right here
right there right that's it that's what
I do and then I wipe half of that away
all right let's see if it does without
giving away the foundation and all the
hard work we're going to contortion all
right now I'm going to bronze up my
complexion a little bit more using this
right here this is by four dial
it's the instaglam contact deluxe
bronzing cutter number two and this
morphe e3 brush and I kind of use it as
bronzer and blush because Kris Jenner
doesn't really wear a lot of blush all
right let's clean up this contour the
makeup section this is just loose powder
and you applied red underneath your
contour to make it sharper but mostly to
clean up this area and get rid of any
shadows or any mess and while we leave
this here doing its thing it's time to
blow now salving enough unfortunately
for me Chris loves your glow but it is
subdued and and and classy it's it's
it's a beautiful glow that looks like
she is glowing from within so it's not a
moon see me all the way here from Earth
Here I am so sadly for me today I'm
going to have to tone it down a little
which is fine so I'm going to go back
into that jus a palette and this color
right here looks perfect
to highlight with yes exactly so it is
giving me a lovely lovely glow but it
isn't blinding which I know I know
that's that day but you know sometimes
it's nice to go a little softer who
would have ever thought I would say that
a nice glistening glow that isn't too
too crazy all the haters out there
exposure we are right and I'm going to
follow through with the same shadow to
highlight my nose Chris does highlight
her nose it it's just just like her
cheeks not as vicious and insane now one
thing the Kardashians and the Jenners
all love is a blinding Cupid's bow so
I'm going to go into this Tarte Pro glow
to go pallid I'm going to go into this
color birth and we're really going to
blind that Cupid slow because they love
giving that cubes awesome love okay now
again
softly remove that powder and we're left
with a clean beer and now as for lips I
seen Chris wear a lot of lip she kind of
alternates between Matt and super super
glossy but sometimes it's like a nude
sometimes it's a light brown sometimes
it's a bright red so she loved her lip
products she created kylie jenner so
then she loves it so I have these new
hourglass lipsticks right here and I
went for the most like like the brownie
nude so we have these two right here so
I'm going to go for believer oh wait on
the lips it's actually kind of like mama
Jenner definitely wear something a
little bit darker than this so I'm going
to go back into idealist so we're
definitely getting there it's just not
Mama Jenner right now so I'm going to go
a little bit darker okay okay here we
are okay that's okay that's the spot and
one thing all that Jenner's and
Kardashian's love is putting on so much
of applause but one thing in particular
they put like a glue of gloss right here
just a little bit above the Cupid's bow
so just a little bit above it and that
is going to give you the optical
illusion of having fuller lips it is a
little bit crazy I feel like it is cool
for own photos but in real life you can
definitely see like a goop of gloss
killing on your keep it slow but you
know we're doing
that we're doing we're going to go a
with skinny-dip live topless first okay
here we go the Cupid's bow moment and
then kind of go like this and correct
here like that
that is a kardashian-jenner mouth and
that guy's concludes my Kris Jenner or
is a Khloe because I feel like I look a
lot like Chloe Dao my Kris Jenner
