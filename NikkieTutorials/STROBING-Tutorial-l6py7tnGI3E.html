lot a lot a lot a lot a lot I've been
getting a lot of questions on Twitter
Instagram Facebook on my channel watch
there is this new makeup trend going all
around Instagram Pinterest wherever you
want to think of you see this face of
Kim Kardashian with this heavy contour
on and then a model with lots and lots
of shine and it all says bye-bye
contouring hello strobing and because of
that everyone has been asking me what
the hell strobing is and today I will
show you what strobing is and don't get
your hopes too far up because strobing
basically is highlighting your face to
the max it's like your typical glowy
skin but six levels up it's taking your
glow levels from ariana grande to Mariah
Carey or is it the other way around now
basically all what strobing means is
highlighting your face dashing a little
bit of blush on and throwing all your
bronzers and contour shades out of the
house so today here on my channel I put
it to the test is it worth it is it
better than contouring you be the judge
let's go on to the tutorial okay so
first strobing the first thing you want
to do of course is highlighting we're
not going to use any bronzer no
contouring powders highlighter and blush
only so the highlighter I'll be using
today is by Becca and this is champagne
pop and this is actually the color that
Jacqueline Hill created for Becca this
is champagne pop and I'll be using it to
strobe my face today so the brush I'll
be using is by Rev II germ and this is
their blush brush and basically when it
comes to strobing all you want to do is
just highlight the the shiznit
out of the face places you want to
highlight when you are strobing our
middle of the forehead tip of the nose
Cupid's bow chin highest points of the
cheekbones underneath your contour lid
inner corners and brow bone so let's do
that so I'm taking champagne pop and my
revered Room brush and let's just get to
town in highlight first of all most
important one is the top of the
cheekbones right at the tops of the
cheekbones go ahead
and glue yourself up and I'm going to
use champagne pop as my base and then
intensified a little bit more using the
ball mary lou manizer over top just in
certain areas so that is highlight
number one tops of cheekbones then next
up is center of the forehead and this is
a tricky one because um this will make
you look oily quite quick but hey we're
all about that strobing life now so
let's just try it
next up underneath where normally your
contour would be right underneath you
want to highlight so for me what is here
okay that does nothing but okay chin
just a chin above your brows at the
highest point so above your arch now
also hit the tip of your nose and your
Cupid's bow and then lastly your brow
bone brow bone and then also they say
your inner corners inner corners and I'm
still mixing champagne pop and Marylou
now lastly you want to pick up a little
bit of blush and give your cheek a
little bit of a flushed feeling so I'm
going to take one of the blushes from
this morphe 9b blush palette and just
smile and put it on the apples of my
cheeks and then blend back do not
contour with this and then to finish off
you have to take some fix+
and switch your face to get rid of any a
powder that may be lying on top of your
skin and just to transform it into this
glowing perfection and then guys you
have been stroked this is what strobing
looks like without contouring anything
just the glow and the blush and that
guys is basically all with strobing
means it's just highlighting your face
to the max will this work for people
with oily skin pal now mm-hmm
do I think this is a fun technique apps
it gives your face somewhat of a more
fresh feel plus it makes you just it
makes you look super glowy and radiant
budge is that anything new absolutely
not
