winter wonder week day number job
yesterday video number one went up and
your response were just overwhelming so
amazing yesterday we had a lot of fierce
cut lines alot so it was a bit drag
--is-- I saw the Commons yes I was
channeling my inner Trixie hotel so for
today I wanted to create something very
sexy not too harsh
it is super bronzy and beautiful now of
course this is gonna fit perfectly for
Christmas but this is also keeping an
eye out for New Year's Eve just
flawlessness and just sexiness and I'm
so excited for winter one week day
number two if you want to know how to
create this makeup look for the holidays
or for everyone it's the lay-by we then
keep on watching
the first product I'll be using today is
by Mac this is a strobe cream and they
recently came out with a lot of new
colors and this one right here is called
peach light and it just gives you this
amazing glow and I love what it does to
the skin like foundation blends
beautiful you with it so that is what
I'm using as a primer they have one more
color called silver light which is like
my favorite because it's so blinding and
it makes you look beautiful but this one
is like a softer version which is good
too for foundation I'm going to keep it
simple today I'm going to go with my
holy grill mac nourishing waterproof
foundation and using a Beauty Blender to
buff this into my skin working on this
5ed here
for concealer today I want to go in with
the Kat Von D's I always forget the name
the Lockett concealer creams and I'm in
the color L 3 and L 1
and as always I'm baking my under-eye
area to prevent it from creasing and
brushing away the bake using my favorite
Sigma s 89 brush
I really have to find a different primer
during winter 150 because I'm gonna be
using this all week I'm using my Mac
soft ochre Paint Pot to prime my eyes
but go ahead and use whatever you want
first I'm going to go into one of my
all-time favorite morphe i shadow
palettes the 3500 matte and I'm taking
disc over here as a transition in my
crease and using circular and windshield
wiper motions I'm giving it a flawless
blend
not going to slightly darken that using
this shade right here and just swooping
this color using a more detailed brush
from left to right on the inner third of
my lid I'm applying this Cosette eye
shadow right here and go and right up
against the crease using a flat shader
brush then giving that a little bit of a
pop using this Maybelline eye shadow in
New York silver I'm obsessed with this
right here on the center of the lid I'm
applying this Pat McGrath labs copper
double of five pigment and I like
getting these on with my fingers first
for maximum pigment and then finessing
it using a brush and finish it with this
warm bronze also by Cosette on the outer
corners
for the lower lashline of taking this
cool-toned
deep brown right here and leaving a
little gap open for some highlight on
the inner corners and of course go as
the low with this as you like and I have
this beautiful sparkly pigment right
here and that is going right on that
open gap that we left out on the inner
corners and finishing off by putting a
little bit of that silver on the inner
corners ephra lashes today I'm going in
with the Lily lashes in the styled can
okay it is now time to contour the
cheekbones because our eyes are so
beautifully sculpted we also need some
of the sculpted on our cheek edge I'm
gonna go in with an old favorite just is
by Kevin Kwan it's the medium sculpting
powder and I always see people use
brushes like this to do their contour
with and I'm always so fascinated by it
because I'm like how how do you Val so
today I'm gonna try for myself this one
here's my morphe it's the m1 for three
okay
tap it in I guess and then oh that's
vicious
okay now we have a line now how do
people let this out kind of flat against
the skin buff it in oh I see I see him
liking this Wow that makes it really
fast and really sculpted let's have more
wow I almost don't have to clean up
underneath anymore it's so clean I like
this for blush and gon go into the oh my
god open for blush I'm going to dip into
the morphe 9 and blush palette and I'm
gonna keep the blush a little bit more
toned okay so I want to rectify
something yesterday my blush looked
intense as cheb angle angling I had some
difficulties with the color balance of
the video so I saturated it too much
everything looked fine when I was
editing it but when I uploaded the video
to YouTube
it kinda added another layer of
saturation making me look super red and
super saturated so today I'm going to
keep it down with the saturation in
editing and I'm going to keep it down
with the blush right for blush I'm going
to use this color right here with a mix
of that color right there
for megalo today I'm so excited to
finally be using this on my channel I
had to keep it a secret for so long
a couple months ago on snapchat I was
the first to show Yugi ways new
highlighter which is called ice and it
just it looked beautiful and phenomenal
and it took a little longer for them to
finally launch it but tomorrow ice
highlighter buys you a is gonna launch
finally and it is it's the wet dream of
highlighters alright so let me swatch it
for you
oh my glowing god it launches tomorrow
morning 11:00 a.m. Pacific Standard Time
get on it because I have a feeling this
will be gone fast
Oh normally I skip this cheek on camera
the baby
it needs more air time Oh alright now
time for lips and I thought about this
but the options are endless you can go
with this super dark one super nude red
you can do whatever you want with these
eyes so by all means if you disagree
with the choice I make for my lips today
you can totally change it to your
likings but these eyes make me feel very
sexy and there's one more thing that
makes me even sexier which is high shine
matte nude lips so what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna apply one of my all-time
favorite nude lipsticks this one is by
melt and it is called sex now this is
super super pill now again if you don't
like that if you're not about that life
don't be like that don't do it just skip
it but I'm gonna do it because it makes
me feel sexy baby
all right because this is a little too
much a little too milky I'm gonna go in
with a lip pencil this one is one of the
Mack Mariah Carey ones it's called new
ombre and I'm just gonna make this work
because it's a little hefty and applying
a little bit of Juiz rose quartz powder
highlighter overtop I've done this one
time for my channel and I just love what
it does to a new lip and it makes it
last all day long and just just way to
do everything just a
I am totally aware that this may not be
for everyone but I love it and that
completes this look so I'm now gonna
finish off using a little bit of my Holy
Grail NYX do we finish makeup setting
spray just a spritz and that guys
