tutorial again it has been so long since
I did a tutorial so today I'm doing an
inspired slash recreated a look of Sarah
Jessica Parker in New Year's Eve on the
end scene you all know what I'm talking
about
lupard saw her look was absolutely
amazing like in the end when she blinked
I was I blink again Sarah blink her
entire look was natural but a little bit
smoky but when she blinked down it was
purple it was absolutely fabulous it's
really wearable for Christmas for New
Year's Eve for anything that you want
basically for a party or just if you
like a purple blink so you guys if you
want to know how I did this look then
please keep on watching ok so the first
thing you want to do is apply a base to
your eyelids to keep all of this that is
going on top of your eyes to stay on the
entire night on Christmas or New Year's
Eve or the day you wake up next to a
stranger and you're like what did I do
it I said the still looks good and the
base that I'm using is by MEK and this
is called soft ochre Paint Pot so the
first thing i shadow wise is just to
bring some definition into your crease
now I just take a really nice contouring
shade for your eyes socket to just make
it a little bit more deeper the color
I'm going to use is cork by Mac to kind
of just define your crease and make your
eyes look a little bit more sunken into
your for a really nice gold touch on the
lid I'm going to use max honey lust eye
what I'm going to do is a pipe wet first
so k see that part that is a little bit
more shiny that is the part where I made
my eyes with a whip you don't want to
make the entire eye shadow wet because
you might ruin the eyeshadow and to make
my brush wet I'm gonna hit mac's fix+
and then just apply that to your lid
then with a dry brush I'm gonna take the
dry part upon us and kind of go on top
for a little bit more shimmer because
honey lust is really really shimmery oh
my god
look at that okay now we're going to
focus on the purple to get that look to
get that purple first I'm going to apply
a dark purple base as an eyeliner to my
eyelids and for that I'm using a lip
liner by Mac and this is called currants
and what I'm going to do with currants
is just line my eyes
really really tiny wing and then
connected to the liner now we're going
to take our bright as purple eyeshadow
this is a sugar pills poison plum which
is my favorite bright purple eye shadow
I want to say eyeliner it's not I got
this perfect brush for it this is the
stigma eyeliner brush from the mrs.
bunny collection and this is the perfect
size to work with that and what I'm
going to do with poison plum is just
first go on top of that liner so what
I'm going to do is take the big brother
of their brush that I just used and go
into a little bit of poison plum and
blend it up
especially on this outer corner right
here kind of wind that eyeshadow out a
little bit more and blended onto the lid
and a little bit into the crease I'm
going to take a 217 from Meg and blend
that out or point out a little bit more
because you do want to give it that a
lift by making a wing which you do not
want to make it a really big big wing
wing now with a really small eyeliner
brush again from Sigma I'm gonna go and
add a little bit more definition to my
lashline and for that I'm going to use
Mac's sketch and I'm going to place that
really closely to my lashes so I'm going
to use a liquid eyeliner this is Urban
Decay's ecstasy and no not XTC but
really like ecstasy and this is super
duper bright now what I'm going to do is
just take a little bit of this and go
really likely over the purple and this
will make it go on fire and mainly focus
on the inner corners of your eyes and
kind of blend it in so it's not really a
liner for more of a blended liner so for
jellal really I'm going to take another
awesome brush by Sigma this is the
angled the small angle brush and with
that I'm going in sketch again and
another brush sketch into the 1st or the
outer half of my lower lash line so it
kind of makes a point like that you want
to get this really small you do not want
to make it too smoky and then just kind
of meet that up with you line on top and
then I'm going to take a really nice
matte white color just take an or like a
cream color I'm gonna highlight the
inner corners of my eyes with that just
to kind of open everything up a bit okay
so data started what you want with your
eye shadow what I'm now going to do is
apply a black kohl to my waterline and
my top waterline so you really give it
that nice little tree effect and I'm
also gonna apply some false lashes these
are the red cherries number one
okay now fur lips we all know that Sarah
Jessica Parker loves to outline them
with a somewhat darker lip pencil for
that I'm gonna use next stone lip pencil
now I'm gonna be really really soft and
they look at with this because if you
apply too harsh
you will look like Pamela Anderson and
that is not what you want and then I'm
going on top with a really nice nude
color between those two I'm going to
make those so yeah thank you guys so
much for watching for a fullness so of
every part that I used go to my website
nikkietutorials comm and again thing

and hopefully I will see you guys next
