Scarlett Johansson's commercial and
photo at for Dolce and Gabanna
the one perfume and I believe this is
the lace edition so if you want to know
how that this look then please keep on
watching so just like every video you're
going to start off your look with a base
to prevent the eyeshadow from creasing
and the one I'm using is my Mac soft
ochre Paint Pot okay so the first color
I'm going to take is from this sleek own
natural palette and I'm going to take
this color right here and I believe that
is called hello that camera hello hello
so as I said I'm going to take this
sleek out natural palette and I'm going
to take this color and I believe that
it's called taupe it was barely
noticeable but scarlet had a little bit
of definition in her crease so from the
sleek own natural palette I'm going to
mix a couple of colors I'm going to take
this color right here and I'm going to
mix it a bit with this one right there
and then to make it softer I'm going to
take that color as well and just really
like we apply some shadow to the crease
for a little bit more definition okay
now going to blend that and I'm going to
take that color again and then baby worm
color and I'm just gonna make it softer
just so it really looks natural and is
if it's supposed to be there you see
this is way too much so I'm gonna take
that warm color only and I'm going to
blend that out okay then on the middle
part of Scarlett's lit she was wearing a
really nice a white shimmery highlighter
for that I'm going to use this Ben Nye
Lumiere I pig went in ice I'm just gonna
put that on the middle of my lid it will
also kind of make this look really wet
and glamorous that was a really sharp
angled brush I'm gonna put that on the
inner corners of my lower lid as well to
make my eyes more
now with the pointed brush like this I'm
going to go back into the pellet and I'm
going to take that water color again and
just a really really tiny teeny bit of
the darker color and I'm going to bring
a little bit of shadow really close to
the lower lashes you can stop here put
mascara on and put your favorite
lipstick or lip gloss on and you're done
I'm gonna do the certificate eyeliner
that she was wearing it was really clean
and simple and for that I'm gonna take
my Inglot AMC eyeliner gel matte in 77
and then let's take a really small
eyeliner brush like this so I'm gonna
start off at the inner corner at the
inner corner you want to keep it as
small and just as crisp as possible
okay and now I'm just gonna make the
wing
now this is basically I want to keep it
really small and really clean but I kind
of failed on the other side so I make it
a little bit thicker on that side but
this is what you want but I gotta make
this of it because then I have even eyes
okay now going back to that Oh natural
pollen I'm gonna go back in that wormy
beige color and I'm just gonna take a
little bit of it and I'm just gonna put
that on the inner corner right here to
warm the look up a bit okay to open up
the eyes even more I'm gonna take this
bed 9 neutralizer cream crayon and this
is perfect for like a nude waterline so
I'm gonna put this on my waterline and
yeah okay now I'm gonna curl my lashes
with japonesque eyelash curler and then
put some mascara on and the one I'm
using is makeup studio maximum volume
and then she had a little bit of
definition on her lower lashes the thing
is if you use black on your lower lashes
this look will be so much more harsh in
so many ways so you want to keep it
really clean and fresh underneath so
what I'm gonna do is I still have a
little bit of definition on a lower
lashes but not black so I'm gonna take
this Mac eyebrow gel and the dial and
you're just gonna just tap that onto the
lower lashes just like so that's what
I'm gonna do right now and then it will
be back friend the lips so I'm gonna
take everything off my lip chart now
like that and then I'm gonna take this
any luck a lip palette that I have and I
gotta take these two colors I'm gonna
mix them I already mixed them a bit as
you can tell I don't know the numbers
out of my head so I will put that on my
website and give tutorials calm and I'm
just gonna take those two colors
take a really pink bomb this is sleek's
frosting lip balm sorry guys that
completes this Scarlett Johansson the
one lace I believe commercial and photo
and makeup tutorial for a full list of
all products used to go to my website
