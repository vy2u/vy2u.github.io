again the weather has cooled down and I
can finally film a tutorial in my room
the heat will be back in a couple of
days but I'm just here filming that
makes me so excited because I'm done in
my basement if not in my bathroom just
in my room welcome to today's video
today it's gonna be all about Selena
Gomez's come &amp;amp; get it music video this
is my take on her look that she was
rocking in that video I got so many
requests for this on a daily basis that
I finally decided to do it I love this
look I love the eye liner love the
lipstick love the music video love
Selena so yeah without any further ado
if you want to know how to get this come
get it make a book then please keep on
watching so it's always the first thing
you want to do is a pie mix your eyelids
to prevent I should for greeting and I
am using my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot so
the first eyeshadow I'll be using is by
Mac and this is called Samoas silk and
I'm going to apply Samoas silk all over
my lid up until the crease and I'm doing
this because Selena had quite a lot of
warmth going on on the lid so I'm just
gonna apply warmth to my lids as well
for the bottom living of the take max
eyeshadow in dark edge and apply this to
the outer half of the lower lid and then
from there drag that out till the crease
so you sort of get your starting point
for your crease none that take max
eyeshadow in texture and then from that
point that you just made go into your
crease sort of wing it out and go in
your crease and then also blend that
down to the lid AHA shape round girl
never take texture and mix it with kid I
shadow by Mac and then apply this to the
inner corner of your lid up till the
Cree
I'll leave the middle of your lid with
the Samoa silk only taking Samoa silk
again and with this I'm going to blend
out the crease oh and I'm mixing it a
bit with kids who just start blending
that crease out and making it softer and
especially with Samoa silk you can warm
up this outer part of the crease because
when Celino is sort of like grinding the
ground and looking up you can see that
right here she had a really nice soft
warm color and that is Samoa silk
okay mixing dark edge with texture I'm
just gonna darken that outer crease up a
bit reveal it I'm not going to take max
pigments in ten and with this sort of go
over the border of Samoa silk and
texture so kind of in the middle of
those two and then same goes for the
outside now I'm going to take this color
star jewel shadows toss effect in number
two oh and take just a teeny tiniest
amount and put that on the middle of the
lid for a nice touch of glitter and then
to further the glitter it up I'm gonna
take my shoe Amira eyes shadow in
glitter bronze and just go on top and
blend that out for my inner corner
highlight I'm gonna take max Blanc type
and just kinda highlight the inner
corners with that nothing too drastic um
I wonder later we'll be using the NYX
slide on pencil in jet black and just
apply that all over just everywhere on
the waterline even the inner corners and
then kind of blend that in with dark
edge okay now it's time for the eyeliner
and it will be using my Mac fluidline in
black track and all you want to do is
make a sort of really thick cat eye and
then also connect the bottom and make a
point towards the center
and that is how you can sort of get that
really nice Arabic pointy eyeliner
okay just mixing a little bit more of
dark edge with the liner now okay now
it's time for mascara and false lashes
for my top lashes I will be using my
makeup studio what approved 3d extra
black as always ever matte bottom lashes
I'm actually gonna use a burgundy
mascara and this is by Kiko and this is
the super color mascara in number 5
which is a brilliant burgundy color and
I love this and therefore false lashes I
will be using these velour lashes in
knotty me and I love the packaging of
these false lashes of the Lord is a
great false lashes company so I will be
applying Noddy me on my naughty eye
liner eyes so yes okay so for lips it
was actually kind of tricky because in
the music video Selene I had so many
filters and effects on her face that
sometimes her lips were like a deeper
sort of blue red and then they were like
an orange red and then they were like
really bright red so I did some
researching on the trusty old Google
people you should try google ones and I
saw backstage photos of Selena's makeup
and entire look and everything and her
lips were a bright almost orange toned
bright red lipstick so for that I'm
going to take my Mac lip mix in red not
crimson because crimson is too dark and
too sort of blue toned and red is sort
of like really bright and a little bit
orange toned so perfect for the Selena
look
further cheeks you want to keep in mind
did you just want to keep it really warm
and bronzy and sort of like an indian
goddess so I started out contouring with
my NYX blush in taupe my five but then I
bronze up my face using my Mac refined
golden bronzing powder and I love this
bronzer for blush I made a mixture
between narcissus Gina and Mac's little
bust area Rose mineralized skinfinish
for that perfect glow that Selena Gomez
had going on as well wow I almost
up that sentence but I didn't boo boo
and to achieve Selena's beautiful glow I
use my Mac pigment in vanilla and I use
that on the highest points of my
cheekbones i'ma nose and keep above this
kind of everywhere just give herself
that glowy
clonus and that ladies and gents
completes my selena gomez come and get a
music video inspired tutorial finally I
get one because I got so many requests
for this it's kind of sick and it's kind
of cool because so many of you wanted to
