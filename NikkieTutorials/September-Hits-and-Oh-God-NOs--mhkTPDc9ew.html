late September hits I know God knows I
already made a entire sort of blog post
on this so if you want the full detail
go to my website nikkietutorials com
there will be a blog post called October
equals insanity October is going to be
super insanely crazy and that's because
last week I was named spokesperson for
hair and makeup for a TV show here in
Holland which will air in March so for
the month of October I I've been busy
with we are agency learning hair
teaching Abby Academy doing this new TV
production which is absolutely out of
this world amazing I just got called by
my Booker and I'm doing a photo shoot
with someone so very awesome at a Sunday
I'm shooting with that person and then
I'm also doing million yachts which is
sort of like a luxe version of Deal or
No Deal and then I have my boyfriend and
I have my family and I have videos to
make on youtube I have blog post reviews
to make I have so many things to do and
it's so crazy
so before I start with my September hits
and oh god knows I want you guys to know
that October is gonna be a little bit
sporadic there's gonna be videos now and
then and then for quite some time
nothing and then videos again and then
quite sometime nothing other than that I
am planning on doing Halloween tutorials
because it's October I'm a beauty guru
I'm here on YouTube for five years now
what I have to do is Halloween tutorials
and I love doing Halloween tutorials
Halloween tutorials are one of my
all-time favorite things to do so I have
planned five to seven looks to do this
year other than that if you want to know
what my September hits it a dog knows
art then please keep on watching the
first thing I'm starting with is this
Catrice and made to stay inside I
highlighter pin and I made a full blog
post review on this so you can find the
link down below in the infobox this is a
nude I call makes you stay inside the
eye so on your waterline normally I
spontaneously use my Ben Nye neutralizer
cream crayons
when I use those that get to Commons one
common is I can never find these where
do you get them and two is these did not
stay on the water line so a couple of
weeks ago I found the Catrice made to
stay inside
I highlight your pen and this is a
waterproof nude-colored
and by do I know I did not get my lips
done
I know ever since I did that flog where
I was like I want to get lip injections
people are like have you gotten them
done already because your lips look
plumper no it's just the natural duck
face I like to do on photos next are the
MEK acrylic paints and these are all the
colors I got I have to thank my good
good good good good friend Joyce for
this Joyce is one creative mother fudger
she makes the most amazing pieces she's
my personal Alex box
she is my one of my bestest friends ever
Beth I've always seen Joyce using these
acrylic paints I just love looking at
them already because they're so goddamn
gorgeous but recently George when the
public's choice of art at the dark
makeup Awards and she used some of these
on her model and I just I was what is
that choice but if that helped me just
like she did with vanilla pigment ever
since I saw her wear of Anila pigment on
her cheekbones there hasn't been a day I
didn't wear it on my cheekbones so now
she told me about these and all I got
I'm so excited I like to kind of live on
the add to now and then so I use two
colors that are not I save on my eyes
today so my eyeliner today is an orange
eyeliner which is red or it's not red
it's called basic red acrylic paints
mixed with primary yellow so these two
together make this eyeliner also firm
off I've been from love I'd be loving
this Mac also from love I've been
macking this pigment know also I've been
loving this pinguin by Mac a crawl of
crawled it crawled upon me I've been
loving this pigment called basic red and
I actually have to think Lisa Eldridge
for this Lisa Eldridge
we all know her lover she did a full
blog post on what makeup she used on the
covers for love magazine and wonderful
models was wearing this beautiful sort
of velvet matte red lip I'm stuck red
lips love red lips I love them matte so
uh so what Lisa did was she applied some
Ruby will lipstick to her models lips
and then padded basic red pigments on
top to give it that really velvet matte
finish now this ladies and gentlemen is
absolutely stunning it transforms any
luscious shiny red lipstick into elf elf
of mint goddess out-of-this-world
experience for other lipsticks I've been
loving this month's are the Maybelline
divots
I've been waiting so long for these to
get to Holland I saw all these blog
posts on American websites like oh these
are the new Maybelline Vivid's
and I was like oh I'm Nikki in Holland
and I can't get them so four colors
arrived in Holland and we have number
nine ten
shocking Coral 9:12 electric orange 904
wild rose and I know it's you fuchsia
flash which is actually my favorite so
these pivots are absolutely amazing I
love the payoff I love the pigmentation
I love the colors I love the finish and
if I don't like the glossy sort of
finish it gives at the end I just take a
Mac pigment that is close to it just
like the trick with the basic red and
then just transform it into a matte
velvet sort of gorgeousness as you could
see in my Primark haul I went to Essen
Germany and when I cut out from that
video is that I also got some Beauty
things one of the things I got is my p2
and this is the sand style polish in
strict this polish right here oh my god
I'm actually wearing it on my nails
right now but it's tipped us out don't
judge don't judge I love this color so
much it's just like a a a jewel just
sparkling on your nails and just every
time you look at it you're like haha
from Bobby Brown I've been loving this
blush called pink coral number 31 I
and just it's the perfect mixture
between pink and peach and coral it's
like the perfect sort of mix of colors
and hues and just I love this I love
this for spring it's great for winter
when you want dun dun slushy pops cheek
pop cheek who remembers that I feel
loving my earrings which are from
forever 21 and if you look closely one
says yes and one says no I've learned
this to one of the shooting days for the
TV show and the host was talking to me
and he was like where you're thinking
Nick and I was like yes and when I
wasn't agreeing on something he said I
was like no my last hit for the month is
my classic specs and classic specs
contacted me they were like we have seen
you wearing glasses in videos I was like
that's really rare I actually wear
glasses in my videos but thank you for
noticing
classic specs is a website where if you
live in America you can choose up to six
frames some glasses glasses normal
glasses you can choose six frames and
then you can let them send them to your
home and then you can try them on and
then if you like one or two or three or
four you can buy them but if you don't
like and we can send them back in
America had the sending back thing and
the sending to your house thing is free
if you're international that costs money
but classic specs was so kind to offer
me two glasses so I could choose two
from their website and one of them is
actually a perfect fit I accept I love
it it's called the P oh boy these are
really huge sort of nerdy P oh boy
glasses I love them they have a really
nice grey with light grey and sort of I
don't know it's a charcoal it is really
big I'm gonna go blind no it is really
big but I kind of love going big because
I feel like with glasses lately it's not
so much about wearing glasses anymore
it's about making a statement and these
are so big and so nerdy and so vintage
that I love these the classics
was also kind enough to give me a promo
code to give you guys $10 off of your
order and let me check
use the code Nikki youtube so Nikki and
I KK ie Nikki YouTube on the last
checkout page to get $10 off of your
order $10 will be taken off and you have
$10 to spend on a vivid lipstick go
check it out the frames are only $89
whereas if you go to like an optician a
frame would be like $200 so enough love
spent for the month of September it's
time to spruce up Hall it is time I'm at
the halter spa and our time for the Oh
God
oh yeah no duh first oh god no this
month and it's actually from this month
October but I'm gonna include it in
September is Rihanna's new music video
pour it up
I like Rihanna I think rihanna is cool
as edgy she's pretty but one thing I
just do not understand about Rihanna is
why is the urge for you to be different
and edgy always turning out to be some
kind of no for example her new music
video pour it up I I kind of liked the
idea of her being like this big ass pimp
in her chair and then with these Paul
dancers in the water and then twerking
and twerking and twerking it was just so
ratchet
it was so no and just her her entire
sort of outfit and hair and just I'm
kind of getting tired of Rihanna of it
because the whole mecca's medics
collection was kinda it's all permanent
it's already promote it's all it's just
I'm kind of Rihanna tired
damn girl know her it is sick and all
God know is Miley Cyrus and I think I've
set this far and again onto the next one
and that's actually all the yo God knows
I
