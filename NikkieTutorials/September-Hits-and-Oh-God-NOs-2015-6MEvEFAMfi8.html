the hips I know God knows I feel like
with this on I belong in the world of
Game of Thrones probably as a hooker but
I don't care it's been such a hectic
month because Rick and I got a puppy her
name is ivy I want to show her with all
the love in my heart but she's on the
vacay with my brother because tomorrow
Rick and I are leaving for LA because I
have a very big special secret project
going on and I hate it when people do
that because when people say that I want
to know what they're up to you
but I really I cannot tell you but it's
gonna be it will blow your socks off but
my first favorite of the month is ivy my
little precious ivy I made her an
Instagram you should follow her her
Instagram is Ivy tutorials just like her
mommy but Ivy my next hit of the month
is a losing weight as I told you I think
a couple of weeks ago here on my channel
I started working out with a personal
trainer and we've been training for five
weeks now
I'm starting to feel more and more
confident I've lost a lot of weight and
my body is just getting so much stronger
and like I'm creating all these muscles
and every time I work out I feel all
these muscles I never knew I even had I
thought people who worked out were a
bunch of people who just wanted
attention
working out scared me it's so
intimidating to show your most
vulnerable self in front of someone else
and if you work out in a gym with other
people in it I've worked out in the past
but I kind of start slacking and
completely let go of it because I gained
weight and it became scary to me to show
my fuller body at a gym and let me tell
you ever since I started working out my
I'm such a happy dork if you're
following me on snapchat you know what
I'm talking about but I just I loved
working out now so along with training
with a personal trainer it's been going
so well along that time that I just
started 50/50 right here contacted me if
I wanted to try out one of their teas
you see the tea's all over the Internet
to grab YouTube everywhere everyone's
talking about the detox teas ever the
longest time I didn't want to do it
because so many people were talking
about it but you know as I started
working out more with my personal
trainer I felt like I had to do
something about my eating habits as well
so I thought why not email them back and
let's give it a shot
so I received the fifty 28 day detox and
I finished one entire bag of this and
let me tell you I am truly a fan I love
this so much it is first of all it's
just it tastes like a dream it tastes
really really nice and I know I started
working out but I feel like ever since I
started drinking this tea I just have so
much more energy and I also feel that it
helps me lose an excerpt push of weight
it's 100% natural and I just feel like
it really energizes me it's like you get
the energy from coffee but you can still
do eyeliner after you don't get the
jitter I'm just a really great fan and I
know that so many people talk about the
tease you're probably thinking what I
thought of it a couple of weeks ago but
let me tell you this truly is amazing
plus it's just nice it's nice to drink
so it's what's the harm in drinking iced
tea so yeah I'll put a link down below
where you can find fit tea and they ship
worldwide yeah if you want to take a
shot at it definitely do I think it's
really nice and with the harm in
drinking some good as to voci handy my
next favorite is by the balm and this is
the man ice your sisters palette they
already know I'm bloody obsessed with
mary-lou manizer right the bomb but they
now combined all the Luminizer 's they
have in one palette so smart so smart so
this palette contains Mary Lou Cindy Lou
and Betty Lou so it's got all their lou
manizer 's I love them it's just a great
palette I think it's amazing that they
put it into palette so two other
highlighters have been really loving are
by all the salsa Beverly Hills these are
the new illuminators and Anastacio came
out with four colors and my two
favorites are so Hollywood and this is a
almost dead on dupe for the extra
dimension skin finish by Mac and whisper
of guilt
it's like twins and this one is my top
favorite and this is called starlight
which I'm wearing on my cheekbones today
tip of the nose Cupid's bow inner
corners it's such an amazing highlighter
it's like Nyx's girl-talk prismatic
eyeshadow but better it's just a little
bit more on the neutral side whereas
girl-talk prismatic eyeshadow is a
little bit more pinky it hits all the
right highlighting spots next favorites
are these lashes that I'm wearing right
here these are the new Hooda Beauty
Sasha lashes and I don't even think
these are launched yet but I'm telling
you that that by the time they're
launching you need these in your life I
mean look at this look at look at this
look at this next up I really want to
talk about the new Kat Von D metal crush
eyeshadows Kat Von D actually personally
send me these which eye she sent me a
personal note with the package and my
boyfriend and I Rick and I we low-key
lost our we were like wait someone
wrote a note and then we said that Kat
Von D signed it and we were like oh so
the new metal crush eyeshadows are
absolutely fantastic I'm wearing the
bronzy one I'm of course I'm wearing the
bronzer one of my eyes today this one is
called synergy so good I mean so good
but another favorite is this one right
here this is called thunderstruck this
is the most beautiful highlighting color
for pale people or anyone who just loves
a hardcore can you this is the ultimate
highlighter for people who love that
glow this is the most extreme
highlighter you will ever get it's just
so amazing it's just so amazing she came
out with a bunch of bright colors as
well this is called paranoid so amazing
I am so obsessed with this line that can
be created with her team this is a goal
I mean come on do we die next hits are a
couple of brushes the first one to talk
about is the Mac 196 so the matte girl I
always walk to you because she's my
favorite we all have a favorite Mac girl
am i right and she told me about this
brush and really she showed it to me and
I was with who needs that let's be
honest here it looks sad so
she told me that she loves using this
for really watery foundation so let's
say like the really thin watery
foundation with this brush those really
watery foundations really get better
coverage and when I hear the words
better coverage I'm sold now the only
thing I have a big face I have a big
face and with this this is tiny I always
love big brushes for my big face this is
a tiny brush it takes a little bit
longer to work here foundation in with
it but honey let me tell you when you
use this for your foundation your
foundation looks on point the next part
I want to talk about it is I got this
because of desi Perkins
it's the 135 it just makes bronzer and
blush or what it highlight or even it
just makes everything go on so nicely
and so diffuse but still strong and so
strong but diffused I got to because
does he use to you in the video so I was
like I need to the last hit I got for
you is the 24 hour extended eye base by
Mac I got this because of luster Lux
here on youtube if you do not follow her
on YouTube or on snapchat you are
missing out Katie
love you so in one of Katie's tutorials
she told people that how when you wear a
chrome or like a high reflective shiny
color on the lid and when you have
hooded eyes ding ding throughout the day
that chrome color will lift up and it
will start moving and just travel on
your eyes space is it's not what you
want with your chrome this to happen she
recommended the 24 hour extended eye
base to put on first and then put the
chrome high reflective color over top
and that will lock it in place and not
make it move throughout the day so where
you put the chrome with where the chrome
stage it is so true Katie you are a
mastermind this definitely keeps this
definitely works so those were all my
hits for the month of September now
let's go on to my oh god no oh yeah
No
so for my oh god no this month I've been
so busy moving to the apartment and with
Ivy so I haven't really gotten a chance
to hate on a product as much I do have a
little thing of what I mentioned so if
you've watched my previous video which
was the Alana's RA one pay extra close
attention to the background and if
you've not seen the video go check it
out it's my previous video go check it
out and pay extra close attention to
that background so I bought this fabric
that had a tiny glitter in it because I
think I love my glitter and for the
Lana's RA look I felt like I really
needed that tiny bit of glitter because
Lana is fabulous so I wanted my
background to be fabulous as well I
missed some of the glitter so my friend
Sharon and I who is from the first clan
formations video came up with the idea
to buy glitter hairspray because glitter
hairspray has the glitter in it and
therefore when you spray glitter
hairspray on to the background the
sparkle the glitter will just lit up a
little bit more so I bought glitter
hairspray we sprayed it all over the
background and it did not help for
you would think that hairspray and
glitter would make this tacky substance
but the glitter was going everywhere so
my entire studio was covered in glitter
I was covered in glitter eyes II was
covered in glitter
Rick's beard was covered include
everyone who went into the studio came
out with glitter I hate this glitter
hairspray now and if you ever feel like
glittering up your background because
you feel like you're back are needs a
little bit more kick with glitter
hairspray don't do it
save yourself the mess don't do it I
know that's not really a neugog know
like product wise but it just really
wanted to share that with you so that's
it guys that were my hits and goth notes
for the month of September it's been so
crazy and October is going to be even
more crazy but I'm excited so for
fullness if every single product
mentioned and used go to my blog each
