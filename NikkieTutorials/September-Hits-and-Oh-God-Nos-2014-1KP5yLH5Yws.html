September hits is it September can we
talk about the fact that every guru
starts their video like this can we talk
about the fact that Halloween is next
month
I am literally so excited for Halloween
I cannot wait to show you what I all
have in mind I already have a list of
all the things that I want to do plus
I'm thinking about instead of two videos
a week
every Tuesday and Friday for October
because of Halloween I want to do three
videos per week every Tuesday Friday and
Sunday but I'm still working on that
kind of seeing how my schedule works and
if I have time for that but I am I am
trying I'm trying anyways today it's
time for my September hit synagogue know
September has been pretty damn good
actually I filmed a lot of videos did a
couple of shoots I actually did quite a
lot of photo shoots and a couple of
shows where I did make up for and
because of those shows I I found out
about new products and I found out about
products that I really seem to love
lately so let's share the moment the
love the products the first hit this
month is by Anastasia Beverly Hills and
this is the unreality it took way too
long for me to fall in love with honest
I so Beverly Hills but let me tell you
once you do fall in love there's no
going back
so the unreality is an amazing eyeshadow
palette I call this one of the best
palettes for fault it's basically got
all the fall colors you need for a fall
look I absolutely love this two pieces I
love the color caramel Morocco and deep
plum and glisten and taupe I love it all
another uh Nastasia palette this is Maya
Mia another one it's exactly the same
size as amrezy it's the exact same
inside just different colors and this
one also is so good for fall colors like
caramel and Sienna a fresh peach and
warm taupe it's just an amazing palette
it's so versatile you can do so many
different looks with this and what I
love doing is combining the two and
making something pretty out of the tutu
there I love uh Nastasia eyeshadow
palettes but these two really are worth
the hype next is a product that I've
been talking about like crazy recently
it's the Ben Nye Lumiere looks powder
all credit goes to Joyce for making me
fall in love with this because she used
this on a photo shoot we did together
and it should put this on her model and
I was like what is that what did you put
on her face and she was like oh it's
that Ben Nye powder
what a night powder and really casually
she drops oh the white one one white one
so I finally got my hands on it and I
absolutely adore the living out of
this it's so so good it's like a wet
glow in a pot it's so amazing once you
dust is on the high plains of your face
your face just transforms into this
glowy goodness that is so high fashion
and so on-trend and so good and so I
cannot next product is by Mac it's the
emphasize shaping powder I got this a
long long time ago and I never really I
never really you know I never really
felt that love for it it was so super
duper lights plus it has a shimmer and
it's not like a severe shimmer but it
definitely has a reflection to it so
whenever I saw Jaclyn hill or whoever
put it underneath their eyes I was like
but no but recently if you're really
getting into that lighter concealer
underneath the eyes magic a lot of
people are doing it lately and I could
not find a powder that was light enough
to keep it light because I am like I am
like paper I'm as white as paper so I
need something wider than paper to keep
it highlighted and my concealer will be
lighter but then once I would powder it
it would become darker again so I needed
a light powder to keep it light I used
emphasize so I put emphasize underneath
my eyes and sort of this triangle shape
I did it today I did it in a lot of
videos this month and I absolutely love
the look of it now I think it looks
super nicely lifted and highlighted it's
an amazing powder too you know
highlight it's an amazing highlighting
powder so yeah a concealer I've been
loving this month is by Anastasia
Beverly Hills also this is the concealer
in point 75 I don't think I have ever
found a concealer that is so high
coverage so concealing it's still so
beautiful on the skin I used it
underneath my eyes today and to clean up
my lip line a little bit and oh God I
can deal with this I cannot deal with
this it's so good it it just it covers
up like magic and then it stays on it
sets it into a lovely matte finish and
it's just a great great concealer and
mixing this with pro longwear you get
like the the most coverage concealer on
planet earth and I'm all about that for
my face not for my models but for my
face another product by Mac I feel
loving this month are the care blends
essential oils and in in in grapefruit
chamomile and I got this because of a
blog post I recently bumped into and I
ordered it applied it to my face felt
like heaven this is if you have dry skin
and you apply this as your moisturizer
before foundation concealer serums
whatever oh let me tell you your face is
so nice to work with like foundation
just glides on beautifully it just
settles in beautifully it just gives you
the perfect face to work with don't
apply too much rub so because if you
over apply you you slide it a little bit
too much and then you know product
starts moving around too much and that's
not what you want but like three to five
drops of the care blends oil oh mama
you're gonna love it next hit by Mac is
the one two seven one twenty seven brush
and this was part of their new it's a
collection with new powders foundations
concealers and this brush and it's a
really odd one because one side is sort
of like your traditional foundation
brush side and once you flip it it's a
powder brush what I love most about it
is that it's so flat and I normally
powder my face and my models face
with the real techniques of blush brush
but it's so big and fluffy and you know
all over the place that once you want to
really exactly powder one specific area
it just kind of goes everywhere and you
don't really have that control and with
this you just take some powder and let's
say oh I really want to eliminate this
shine right here you just tap it on and
the shine is gone this just gives you
the control over a powder that you look
for in a brush and what I really like
about the two-sided two-faced
you know dealio here is that this side
has a lot more coverage than this side
so let's say you want to pack on a
little bit more powder underneath the
eyes you take this side pack it on pack
it on and what you want to go on the
light route you take the other side and
you sort of lightly powder the face so
if you really want a powder the face to
go for this side if you want a powder in
the face you go for this side it's an
amazing brush I really have to get some
backups before they you know run out
just continue it whatever but it's an
amazing brush I really really like this
one another brush I've been loving is by
zoeva it's the 226 smudger brush and
this is just the perfect brush for the
lower lash line I been using it a couple
of weeks now and it just makes lower
lash line I shadow application so so
easy it just has the perfect size this
the perfect stiffness and width and and
it just it's perfect for underneath and
you can really pack color in there and
you can really you know sink your eyes
in on the lower portion of your eyes and
it's just a great great brush I also
love it for a buffing out eyeliner or
all that stuff it's an amazing wish an
eyeliner that I feel loving this month
is by NYC and it's the liquid eyeliner
in black and you all know I got this
because of crispy and dusty makeup here
on YouTube my girls my girls I love you
look this is an old-school liquid
eyeliner it really is a brush with hairs
the formula and consistency on this one
are great because it's it just glides on
it's really easy to make a winged liner
with this the only con
I have to it is that I wish it was a
little bit more deep and intense it's
sort of like a 75% black once you first
put it on but then after the second
layer it becomes 100% black but I want
something that is 100% black the first
go but nonetheless it's a great eyeliner
and dusty and crispy are so right about
this one it's awesome so the last hit I
really wanted to show you I wrote it
down
black opium perfume by YSL I left it at
my boyfriend's place but the black
opieop the new black opium perfume by
youths and the law is oh mama
when I went and got black opium perfume
the girl who was selling it to me to
hopefully be where once you spray this
on you will never get enough of it and
she's so so right everytime I spray a
little bit of black opium on my body
I just I'm gonna take the bottle pour it
in a bath and sit in it so that's it for
my hits this month let's go on to see ok
No
so my one and only oh god no this month
and it's not by one brand in particular
but it's this step in an eyebrow routine
it's called brow wax and normally I'd be
like oh yeah wax it up girl do whatever
you want to do with that wax girl but no
no no no a lot of people out there love
to apply brow wax to the brows first and
then go in with a brow pencil a brow
shadow a brow gel whatever and for the
longest time I have tried to understand
that but I can't the thing with me is
that if I put my brow products on
without brow wax it just glides on
beautifully it sticks to the skin it
does what it's supposed to do but once I
apply brow wax before all those steps it
just glides around goes everywhere brow
pods don't tend to stick they don't they
don't adhere to the brow it's just I do
not get why people want to put brow
on first and then have all this trouble
of their products on top sliding around
and being opaque in one spot and not
opaque in the other and how is confused
me man and then there is the other
technique where you use brow wax as sort
of a setting gel man you create holds
with that I have tried so many ways to
make brow wax work for me it doesn't so
if you use brow wax and it works
perfectly magically good for you let me
know the secret let me in on that secret
because I don't get it and that's it
