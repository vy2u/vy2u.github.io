look for you I don't know what to call
it yet I'm leaning towards spotlight
glittery smokey party eyes with like
this middle-eastern touch with the
pointy inner corner it's just a really
fun smoky look and it's not as dramatic
and extreme as all the other looks I've
been putting out recently with all the
drag looks so um natural hair smokey
eyes no drag you must be proud see it
without any further ado if you want to
know how to get this look right here
then please keep on watching I'm
actually really excited to film this
tutorial today because I get to play
with all this new stuff and I'm so much
dope okay the first product I'll be
using is of course my hangover
replenishing face primer by Too Faced
just to get me started
then I purchased this Giorgio's armani
fluid chair in number 2 and i got this
because it really appeals to me
highlighting wise I think it's a
beautiful product to highlight the
complexion and to give that really nice
luminous feel so I'm just going to take
a little bit of that and just apply to
my entire face and see if it's really
nice and glow mmm hmm not going to lie I
expected something a little bit more
likely Becca shimmering skin perfectors
this does not do that for foundation
today I'm going to try the Giorgio
Armani luminous silk every youtuber an
instagramer and everyone who loves
makeup in this world has been talking
about this and I'm so glad that I'll be
finally trying it out today okay and I'm
just going to buff it in with my Sigma
f80 a brush
this is a very unique foundation it
applies in a completely different manner
guys I don't know yet it's kind of
highlighting my dry patches I'm not I'm
not sold on this yet I'm going to be
contouring today is in my Kryolan TV
paint stick in FS 31 because I just
loved the way it made my cheeks look in
my previous miss fame tutorial I think
this is a very good contouring shade for
me and I thought that have made my
contour look on fleek in my last video
if you haven't seen it yet check it out
and concealing and highlighting today
will be done using my pro longwear
concealer by Mac in NC 15 and the
Kryolan TV paint stick in 406 so
concealing highlighting
and I'll quickly setting that with
powder to prevent creasing all right I'm
now going to go ahead and do my brows
off-camera and one eye and then it will
be back I will crazy our dough so the
first thing as always is I'm applying a
base and I'm using my Mac soft ochre
Paint Pot the first shade I'll be using
is fun by Anastasia Beverly Hills and
I'm just really easily blending this
into my crease and we're going to keep
the shape very rounded so you want to go
from outer to inner corner and your
highest point should be right here in
the middle on the center of my lid I'm
applying the colour-pop super shock
shadow in EXO I love the shade so much
it's super light reflective but still
natural and glam I love it then on the
outer parts of the lid I'm taking this
Cinderella pigment by Mac called pretty
it up
and I'm going to intensify my crease
more using more honest as you briefly
hill shades this right here is a warm
taupe and this here is smoke and with
that I'm just building up the intensity
let's spark up that center portion a
little bit more I'm taking max reflex in
Pearl just to sparkle it up for the
lower lash line I'm again taking this on
the size River Lea Hills the smoke and
warm taupe shadows and I'm just going to
smoke up my lower lash line on the
waterline I'm applying NYX jumbo pencil
in milk and then lastly with my cavity
tattoo liner in trooper I'm going to
create a little tiny point on my inner
corners to finish off this look of
course we need some falsies and today
I'm going to be a house of lashes kind
of girl I'm going with these siren
lashes on my top lashes and I'll be
using darling lashes on my lower lashes
all right let's focus on the cheeks a
little bit more I'm now going in my Kat
Von D shade + light contour palette and
this is also my first time trying this
it's new I bought it and I'm going to
intensify my contour today using a
mixture of these two right here because
this is way too dark so I'm going to go
for these two right here oh shoot mmm
that's pigmented for bronzer today I'm
going in the Too Faced matte bronzer in
light/medium
for blush I'm going in with the color
pop super shock cheek in trickery and

nude and glossy I really want to try one
of my new honest eyes of revelry Hills
