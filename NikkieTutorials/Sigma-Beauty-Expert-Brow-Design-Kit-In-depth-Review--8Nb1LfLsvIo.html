Netherlands has broken it's here it's
summer that means two things one yes I
can get a tan out too it's almost
unbearable to film videos in my room
again when it's summer and I have to
film a video it feels like my skin is
dripping off just like now so if you see
something falling off it's me so today
I'm going to do an in-depth review on
these Sigma Beauty Expert brow Design
kits I'm really excited about this I saw
some pictures of this on Instagram and
on Twitter a couple of weeks ago and
immediately it sucked me in because I
was like a kit for your brows is genius
so as I start off with every single
review the packaging I like the
packaging it is it's different it has
this painted girl on it with chrome pink
eyebrows and then Beauty Expert bra
design stigma and then in the back it
tells you what kind of ingredients are
in it it's just like a kit a book kit
thing and this is what it looks like on
the inside the Beauty Expert bra design
kit contains all of the arching shaping
and grooming tools needed to achieve the
most beautiful and defined brows
included in the kit are 5 brow powder
shades Bella Chloe
Scarlett Natasha and Valentina the e75
angled brow and e81 dual ended brush a
jewel and the brow pencil jewel and a
brow gel dual ended highlighting pencil
small medium and large brow stencils a
tweezer scissors and a sharpener for
like a radio person I'm gonna okay we
got a pack now I love that some of these
products are pink I am a sucker for pink
it's a good scissor well no complaint is
that it is too big plus it has a curve
in it so let's say you're gonna cut like
this you're gonna get like a longer part
in the front and like a gap on the
middle so you kind of some maneuver your
way into using the
scissors I mean it's a good scissor it's
sharp it works cuts but I just don't
like that little teeny tiny curve in it
for the tweezers again I love that there
are this sort of purpley pink I am a
sucker for that but again I am not
feeling the curve in it because I am in
love I've been using this for four years
now this is a l ux Lux tweezer and I've
got this for four years now and I love
that it is so straight and so like cut
like strictly cut with the stigma
tweezer I just I don't really know how
to hold it in my hand and I just I feel
like the curve in it makes it harder to
hold it sort of so when I pluck a hair
it kind of breaks off I don't know I'm
so used to my Lux one so it might just
be me it might be perfect for others
then on to the Browse stencils I hate
these
I hate brow stencils it doesn't matter
if you thick my system intricate son
estas yeah I don't care who it is
I hate brush stencils I feel like when
you really follow a browse stencil it
kind of looks as if you glued on your
eyebrows as if you like son I round the
ground you were like hey you're gonna go
on my face now my philosophy with
eyebrows is that you have to look at
your face I hate it when people say well
you have to start your brow right here
and then it has the end right there and
the highest point should be right here
I hate it when people say that what I
believe in with eyebrows is just looking
at a face looking at your own face and
just see what looks good on you I mean
if you have a really wide nose and
you're gonna start right here your
eyebrows are gonna start way back there
as well so please people if you have
somewhat of a wider nose don't go do
this your breaths will start way here
well they should be starting here the
highlighting pencil now this one I
really really like and this are a matte
pinky highlighting color and
shimmering gold color now I really love
these problem is I do not like them for
my brows I love this matte pinky shade
for as a base on your eyelids or in your
waterline to open up things and I love
love love the shimmering part it's
amazing for inner corner highlights for
on the lid for a highlighting face I
love it just not for under my brows I
actually did my brows with the kit today
and I used the matte pinky shade as a
highlighter underneath now when I first
used it I felt like it was a little bit
too harsh a little bit too pink a little
bit too there but as I look in the
mirror now I actually start to really
like it underneath that we have the brow
pencil we have a dark side and we have a
medium side the quality of the pencils
are amazing they are soft smooth and
they are pigmented aren't too harsh or
too much you just stroke some hairs on
and it looks like you have a brown your
hand underneath that we have a sharpener
now I really like this because it has a
big old hole so this will fit with your
NYX jumbo pencil or any big sort of
pencil that you have then right next to
that are the powders there's an amazing
range of colors they're pigmented they
don't crumble up in the pan i I love
them they are super duper good
underneath that is a brow gel you have a
clear side and you have a colored side a
tinted side I use the clear one today
and a couple of days before and it
really makes your hairs stay put also to
ten-to-one it isn't too dark it isn't
too light it gives definition to the
hairs of your brows then less than at
least in the kit is a brush and this is
the brows beauty eyebrows brush you have
one side with a slanted eyeliner sort of
type of brush and you have a spoolie
side overall I am a big fan of this
palette I just have one little tiny
thing that i really suggest a sigma if
you break apart the eyeshadows and sell
them individually so Bella
Chloe Scarlett Natasha and Valentina
break them apart and sell them in
Julie so you can just take your color
that is good for you and just put it in
your and your kid in your in your
routine bag other than that I think it's
an amazing kit it is super super super
helpful for beginners out there you kind
of have everything that you need would I
recommend it to others definitely if
you're a beginner perfect if you want to
experiment with your brows perfect if
you're a makeup artist and you want more
colors for in your kid perfect but just
keep in mind that the packaging is kind
of big for in your suitcase or whatever
