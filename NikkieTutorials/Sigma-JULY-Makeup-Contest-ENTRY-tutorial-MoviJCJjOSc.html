Sigma contest entry for July um the
contest was all about creating a look
for a certain dress and the dress is in
the sidebar because I don't want to
include it in my videos I feel like
stealing it so it's in the sidebar so
check it out and you needed to create a
style for that track so what I did was a
burgundy and purple glitter liner look
and I seriously love this look it's
great for going out but I think it's
great for that dress too and stigma
thank you so much for this great contest
and what's so much fun it was one of the
most fun looks I've ever done next to
Deanna's contest but I really like it
and I hope you like it too and if you
want to know how I did this keep on
watching so of course your first step is
to apply a base to your lips and I'm
gonna use my miss hand
oh I forgot to take it I'm going to use
my miss hand I shadow base and on top
flat to make the colors pop I'm going to
use some NYX milk pencil look how short
it is okay so the first step is to apply
your lid color and I'm going to use a
max 7 taupe and Sutton's hope is a taupe
color mmm
I'm going to take a station brush and
that is going on to the lid and pack the
color on like that now I'm going to take
glam Couture Hershey's kiss and it looks
like a brown with the gold glitter but
the weird thing about this is is that if
you blend it it becomes this burgundy
reddish color and that is exactly what I
want so I'm taking that on a blending
brush and I'm going to work that into my
crease and on the outer corner and stop
her out there then go any further in and
just make it darker and blend it in and
all that good stuff
God don't go any further in and then
just blend it out
go up
now take any black matte color you own
and I'm going to use one from the nasty
bitch palette from bitch-slap Cosmetics
and I'm taking that for that CVS aqueous
wash to do and um this is going on the
RV so work that along the quiz to darken
it out of it and then take the bigger
one that one and blend it with the
others and then take some more make it
as dark as you like now I'm taking that
tiny Kashuk blending brush and blend
that black out now you are going to do
your highlight and I'm going to use this
252 brush and go in gesso by Mac and as
you know gesso is that white color my
favorite color by Mac this is going on
your brow bone and blend all those other
colors down and I already told it in my
previous videos but this is my favorite
way of blending because you blend all
the colors down and then you repeat the
other colors and it will have so up will
be beautiful beautiful beautiful
beautiful so plan it to your brow bone
and blend it down so now you're going to
repeat all the colors I'm not going to
repeat on the sentence hope I'm a litt
then I'm going to repeat the Hershey's
kiss on my crease then I'm gonna do the
black then the set until the Hershey's
kiss the black and you keep doing that
until it's like this and it's really
pretty and then
we'll tell you how to do the white in
the inner corner to yellow Roylott and
the rest so keep on watching if we're
the inner corner take gesso and pack it
heavily on the brush and this is going
on your inner corners now take you to 22
by Mac and take fierce bitch
kaleidoscope wheel by Nikki from Nick
shop and go in that dark purple and this
is going in your crease too and since
this is the 222 you will have to take
like no effort to blend this in it goes
automatically so I had to turn on this
light above me because it is pouring
outside not normal but anyways you
applied that dark purple in your crease
and now for the lower lid you're going
to take some black and you're going to
smudge this to half of your lid and then
take gesso and pack it on really heavily
on that in the corner now for the fun
part for the purple glitter you're going
to take Mitchell Cosmetics baddest bitch
purple pigment
and take any small shader brush and take
some of that pigment this is going on
your lash line this is going to act as a
base for your purple glitter so once you
have that purple on you're going to take
bitch love cosmetics umm purple glitter
and this one is amazing and this is
going to cover a net purple show so
apply it and I'm going to use a lot of
this because I really want that purple
to like be an eye catcher so
once that first layer is dry I'm going
to apply another layer and another layer
so I'm going to let this dry and if
you're going to recreate this look
listen to me
keep your hat like this and don't look
up if you look up the glitter will be in
your crease and you won't get any way
it's so pigmented it won't go away so
look like this I'll look like a freak
but look like this because else it will
ruin your makeup so let it dry then I'm
going to do my mascara this is so weird
the false lash effect by um Max Factor
and then some black eyeliner on your
waterline then I will apply another
glitter liner let that dry and then I
will be back to tell you what is on your
lips so keep your head like this be
right back
so on my lips I wanted to keep it
neutral since the eyes are so booming do
you notice it's lighter again the rain
stopped but anyways um I used one 34
darling by gosh I have neglect this one
since I got myth by Mac but I still love
it I love love love it
so that is ami with Sigma thank you for
this great contest to dress she was
wearing looks beautiful and I thought
anything could match it so I did this
and I liked it and um everybody wish me
luck in the contest I hope I win and
know it's watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
