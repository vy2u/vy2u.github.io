back-to-school look um let me do a
close-up it's just a really um natural
look with a lot of shine on the eyes and
some new lips it's just a really simple
look um the eyes and the lips will take
about ten minutes to do I did do my
foundation already so in in total it
will be like fifteen minutes twenty
fifteen to twenty so if you want to know
how I did this look then please keep on
watching so the first thing I already
did is applied a base to my eyelids to
prevent the eyeshadow from creasing now
especially when you go to school you
want to apply a base your eyelids to
prevent the eyeshadow from creasing
because um in between classes you might
get sweaty so the one I'm using is my
Mac soft ochre Paint Pot and I
absolutely love that one the first color
I'm using is this eyeshadow from makeup
studio and it's called ivory gold now
this is my favorite eyeshadow from
makeup studio ever it's just so darn
pretty so with the brush I'm just going
to put it on the inner corners right
here to open up the eyes and then also
underneath then blend it onto the lid
and I'm also going to put it on my brow
bone that looks fantastic love it now
I'm going to take this makeup city or
eye shadow again I don't have a number I
will put it on my website tutorials
comment I'm going to mix it with this
Mac quad with this color and the color
is called angel Flay and I'm just
putting that color on my lid
and then I'm just taking a blending
brush and I'm blending it out into the
crease okay what I'm going to do now is
take some black waterproof eyeliner and
line my top lip with it okay I know you
want to do now is crumble lashes I'm
using my dip enhanced eyelash curler and
some waterproof mascara
I don't like waterproof mascara better
because it holds the curl a little bit
better I'm going to use my makeup studio
water-resistant of Volume Mascara so I'm
going to do that and then I will be back
for the lips now for lips you can put on
any color that you like because the eyes
are so soft and so natural um I like to
keep it all kind of into soft tones so
I'm going to take my favorite MAC
lipstick this is I know the shape of it
is like oh and this is next playing coy
lipstick and I'm just going to put that
onto my old lips and then just the
bottom lip only and then just like that
and then just um blend it out so that
completes this back-to-school look it's
just a really pretty soft shiny I was
just some new kind of lips so I hope you
guys enjoyed that if you have any
questions leave them in the comment
section below on my website they give
tutorials on there's a full list of all
products used plugs when I'm wearing
them is a lot like nails and stuff um
yes so I hope you enjoyed I love you and
uh stay in school or um don't when
you're 14 Adam big good kids it will it
will be good for you in the lung oh yeah
