tutorial on my sort of everyday summer
look this is an everyday look that I
tend to wear a lot lately it's natural
but it has sort of that glamor feeling
and I love glamour so good leather all
the way if you want to know how I got
this look then please keep on watching
so of course the first thing you're
going to do is apply a base your eyelids
to prevent everything from creasing and
the one I'm using is neck soft ochre
Paint Pot then I'm going to take shade
ster blush by Mac and I'm actually going
to use this in my crease because this is
such an amazing color so just start by
simply putting that into your crease and
then with a bigger blending brush I'm
going to make that softer and blend it
out taking next chamomile eyeshadow
using that as a brow bone highlight and
with this brow bone highlight it's the
perfect time to even blend that shade
stir even more to really make it perfect
therefore my eyelids I will be actually
using three products and I will be
starting off with the makeup geek
glamorous eye shadow and homecoming and
I'm going to mix the two together I'm
going to start putting those on to my
eyelids and just all the way and these
two colors are so pretty together it's
like the perfect soft bronzy tiny color
let's make that even more gorgeous I'm
going to take this pigment by Mac called
blonds gold and this is going over the
lid as well for an even more amazing
gorgeous shine goes over the makeup geek
eyeshadows and oh my dear Lord this is
so pretty okay taking a bit of shade
stir and a to makeup geek eyeshadows
again and I'm running that along the
outer corner of my
lower lashline just to give it some
depth then taking blondes gold again and
that it's going onto the middle of my
lower lid and then blending to the inner
corners and out and just blend it all
over for my eyeliner I will be using
Mac's fluid line in dip down and I'm a
little trick for people with hooded
eyelids like myself is to make your
eyeliner wing and just do a wing like
you always do but instead of going all
the way in with your eyeliner just make
it really really thin and stop in like
the middle and that way you still get
that eyeliner feeling but you're not
covering up your entire lid and you can
still see the shine that you have
applied before
and this way people with hooded eyelids
can just wear eyeliner as well without
covering up their entire eyelids now for
my waterline I will be using this bend I
knew tral Iser cream crayon and then
last but at least I will be applying
some mascara to really get those flirty
long lashes and the one I'm using is by
makeup studio and this is the waterproof
3d extra black appear for the cheeks I
decided to go just like I normally do a
lot of shying a lot of contour and a
little bit of blush and I decided to go
a little bit warmer to sort of give it
that more bronzy summer feeling as a
contour I used a NYX blush in taupe and
I took a little bit of that shade stir
that we use for the eyes as well then as
a blush I used Mac's pink tea blush
which is absolutely gorgeous it's
natural but it still gives you that
natural like flush and then as a
highlight on my cheekbones I am using my
favorite extra dimension skin finish in
whisper of Gil by back for my lips I
decided to keep it really natural so I'm
using my favorite new lip combination
first I'm blanking on my lips as my lip
erase by Mac so I'm just sort of
blanking them out and then on top of
that I'm going to use hue lipstick by
Mac so that guys completes my simple
summer makeup tutorial for summer thank
