thing you want to do like always is put
a primer on your eyelids to prevent that
I shadow from creasing and I'm using my
Michael taught nude cream eyeshadow so
the first pigment of makeup studio I'm
using is called taupe taupe taupe taupe
and with a Mac 239 I'm just popping that
on to the lid yeah just go on to the lid
go a little bit up into the crease and
go like halfway in then I'm going to
take another pigment and this is called
amethyst with this and just pop that on
to the remaining space of the lid and
just go into the crease as well I'm
going kind in the middle for some
sparkle I'm not going to take my Sigma
small taper blending brush to up the
e-40 5 and I'm going to mix the amethyst
and the taupe together and put that in
the crease after the highlighting points
I'm going to take max vanilla and makeup
studio ivory gold this is my favorite
eyeshadow they have and first I'm just
going to take a vanilla eyeshadow and
pop that onto my brow bone and I'm going
to take some ivory gold and push it
right on top and this is this is like oh
my god
this is a the most amazing gold Sheen
ever like ever now I like to take that a
45 again with taupe only and mix it with
the ivory gold so I have no
sheeni blend now with that 8:45 again
I'm gonna take another pigment and this
is called topaz and this is like oh and
um this is going on to outer corners of
the look just to life deepen it up a bit
and to give it a little bit Brown cuz I
always love brown brown it's the way you
want to go down okay so as you can see
on the inner corner I have a really big
highlight as well just to open up the
eyes with the fake lashes and stuff so
I'm going to take the same BH Cosmetics
brush in the same vanilla and I'm just
going to pop that into the inner corners
only now actually for some fun fun a
Rebecca Black I'm gonna take this
gorgeous pigment from Illamasqua and on
camera it looks just plain white but you
can see you can see it um it has a pink
glitter in it and I don't know how they
made it but look that is in it oh oh oh
I'm gonna take some of that pigment and
it's called stetic if we're the lower
lid I'm actually gonna take Mac Swiss
chocolate and I'm gonna mix that with
our lovely topaz again and for that I'm
using a fake mega brush I got on eBay
mmm I'm sorry it was just when I started
out it was like oh I need some mick
brushes and then i bought a lot on the
ebay and then I found out they were fake
and go like halfway in and then because
I'm the bottom I want out shimmer as
well I'm going to take topaz and pop
that on top damn I like going hanging
move aside okay so for the last like
eyeshadow step I'm going to take alum
asked us um I pencil in
here you are it's called um innate and
it's a white pencil and I'm just going
to pop that onto the inner corners of my
eye to open them up like even more and
then set it with a shimmery shimmery eye
white eye shut out and I'm going to take
this makeup studio palette and they have
a nice shimmery white one to set it with
for the lash line i'm actually using
gosh um truly brown velvet touch
eyeliner okay what i'm not going to do
is align my eyes with a blue liquid
eyeliner i'm using mac's super slick
liquid eyeliner in signature blue and
eye lashes i'm using are the mac member
h don't know how you guys do it but i
always apply lashes with like a hand
mirror and then my mom and the surprise
for me she was like nick nick we're
going to put some new stuff in her shop
look at that it's a model mirror
look it has oh hello and take this
mirror with you like um if it's dark
outside and you're like oh I really
really want to do a touch-up right now
but you don't have a mirror with you you
just take this and because it's dark you
pop it alone so my mom sells this mirror

harmonica and I got it from hearts and
crew no I got it from love hearts and
crosses up come or I would put the link

want to do is the blank time out with my
lip erase from neck and then I use this
pencil this is by NYX and it is called
dolly pink so I'm going to put that on
me right now

you either love or hate this color I
love it so I'm just going to put that
one on so you can keep go like this and
just put some powder on top to make it
mad or put some gloss on top to make it
glossy I'm actually I'm going to take my
illamasqua pure pigment in static again
