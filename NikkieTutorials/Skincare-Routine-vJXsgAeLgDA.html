back room zucchini here the camera is
pointed towards the mirror so I can look
at my selfie to see what I'm doing um I
really should look look how how really
smart I am right now
and that is what you call a setup
okay guys so today I'm going to show you
my skincare routine and it has been one
of my most requested videos ever like
since I started YouTube people wanted to
know what do you use on your skin before
I'm going to start I'm going to show you
my new friends
this is Hank yes and this is my name
it says Nikki I will put links on my
website for where you can get these and
stuff like that
I never said the videos how do we move
so everything I use for my skin is in my
mom's webshop my mom has a webshop which
is called s cosmetic a heisman - now so
the things that we'll be using our
cotton pads the play B face makeup
remover Dermalogica dermal clay cleanser
Dermalogica multi active toner water an
intensive moisture balance moisturizer
by Dermalogica as well yeah okay so the
first thing I do is I take off my
glasses and I'm take out my contacts if
I wear contacts that day that was such a
stupid English sentence I always take
six cotton pads - for the toner on my
face I can't even see the camera I'm so
blind and for for my eyes in my face so
with the despre or the this is
make up video you just have to shake it
because it's shakable I just take two
cotton pads squirt some of the blue
stuff on it and if you look at my eyes
today I'm wearing a blue glitter with
this it's with this it's off in like
three wives like you know the gosh the
liquid eyeliners the color ones when you
scratch your eyeballs out the liner will
still be there with this it actually
takes everything away so I'm just going
to do my eyes gone can you see it I did
one swipe and it's gone and now to ask
era and I line it in my eyes Oh
once I have removes my eye makeup with
it once I've done that I'm going to do
my face makeup I'm going to grab this
Dermalogica dermal clay clothes off and
um this works like the best you
only need a little teeny bit like but
and then just grab another cotton pad
decide it on the cotton pads and then
get rid of her face makeup and your
eyebrows like those we use and then once
that is all gone I like to go over my
eyes one time more and everything then
what I always do and what I really like
is clean my face with water I love water
yeah you're probably once it is but I'm
going to wash my face with water now oh
wait tank go away
there's like a towel and try it once
you've done that with the water you're
going to take the toner and what toners
do is like
minimize your pores or close them I
don't know in any way they look smaller
well let's say it's kind of good
actually and I'm going to get the last
cotton pass and remove any makeup that
is still on this will get anything gone
that was still there look but I'm not
going to do is take a q-tip and get the
dirt out of my inner corners right and
then the last thing is moisturize and
moisturizing is so important for your
skin it makes your skin non dry stuff
like that you know it's just good for
your skin so I'm going to grab intensive
moisture balance by Dermalogica best
freak'n moisturizer ever so I'm going to
take the moisturizer and just put it on
my face now I have combination skin I
have a really early t-zone and really
dry patches on my chin on my jawline and
what I use to make those dry patches
really moist and moist
I use a Dermalogica rep bari Air Bari
air repair and you don't need a lot of
this you just need this under spots that
are dry so I'm going to grab the Berea
repair stuff and put it on your dry or
reals so that is how I clean my skin
that is my skincare routine and then if
any day my skin is a little bit drier I
just

skin every single day every day
