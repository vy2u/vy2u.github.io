tutorial featuring the sleek ultra matte
dark pellet when I first got this pellet
I didn't really like it but when I
started working with it the powders like
the eyeshadows really weren't that
powdery and like loose and chalky as
sleep normally is it's been super super
hot in Dunellen slightly and even now
it's really hot and I've been wearing
like mascara and that lip gloss and I'm
just not sure I don't wear a lip gloss
I've been really like really soft colors
and I was like I'm gonna go goth today I
want to go edgy I want to go dark I'm
just not gonna give a crap about it so
without any further ado let's go through
the tutorial and all yeah of course the
first thing you want to do is to pi/8
base to your eyelets tube depends the
eyeshadow from creasing and the one I'm
using is my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot I'm
gonna start out by using minted I called
by Mac the sort of but aligning that on
my lower lash line
and quite thickly because this is sort
of like an edgy Goffe look so we can go
quite thick underneath I'm gonna leave a
really small spot open and that is gonna
really work nicely with the green
glitter highlight later on I'm gonna
take the dark green eyeshadow from the
sleek ultra Metz dark pellet and with
that eye shadow I'm just setting that I
cold I'm taking a smaller brush and
filling up that wine as well remember
that spot we want to leave open for
later on and then with the green start
winging it out now taking max chroma
graphic eye pencil in marine ultra and
with that you're gonna cut your crease
and I'm gonna go all the way in
I'm gonna make it slightly thicker I'm
not gonna take this dark navy blue color
from the sleep palette and with that I'm
going to set the mech marine ultra
chroma graphic pencil
now I'm gonna start blending it out and
going up with that marine color only for
now
and you really want to take your time
blending this look because it's a matte
palette and met eyeshadows are one of
the hardest things to ever blend and now
I'm going to take this sounds like jeans
colored eyeshadow from the palette and
I'm going to start blending that above
the navy blue so that is sort of going
even higher up and yes
I'm even going all the way to my nose
line right here because it's nice and
edgy but just keep blending and
reapplying we're gonna line I'm going to
use this beautiful purple color and
really simply just pack that on to
deliver leaving this outer part free I'm
gonna take the dark navy blue again and
mix it with the black and I'm gonna put
that on my outer remaining corner that
is free I'm gonna go back into the jeans
blue and believe that crease out a
little bit more it's all about blending
people and I say that a lot in my videos
lately and I should get a new dictionary
or something that should be very well
smooth it out I'm even going to take a
bit of that gray color to blend the
crease out even more it's really lightly
buff the edges now I'm going to go into
the white and just a tad teeny bit of
that cream color and with that I am
going to highlight my brow bone and now
is the perfect time to whip that white
highlight color blend down the blue as
well because
look is so so mad I'm kind of missing
shimmer a bit I'm gonna take this mag
eyeshadow in crystal Avalanche and
highlight my brow bone with that just to
give it a really tiny bit of humor so
for my glitter I'm using the obsessive
compulsive cosmetics OCC glitter in mint
and my base to make it stick is deal it
glitter clearly liquid glitter base
first just putting the glitter base
where a woman glitter to stick to and
then I'm gonna go into my mint glitter
by OCC and go over that and I'm filling
up the gap that we had earlier and just
blend it to like middle of your lower
lash line no I love glitter smokey eyes
for my waterline I'm going to use the
Mac chrome graphic eye pencil in NW 25
in NC 30 and then for my mascara I'm
using the usual which is the makeup city
of mascara in waterproof 3d extra black
from it takes that first contoured with
NYX or NYX blush in taupe so that is my
contour then as a really really soft
blush I didn't apply a really whole
bunch of blush because the eyes are so
dramatic I used pink tea by Mac and this
is a really nice neutral color so you
set us a blush and then it's a highlight
I use the face frond flash light
highlight powder and auto focus this is
insanely pretty and my mom sells it in
her webshop so please go check that out
mint for my lips you have a lot of
options you can go if you really want to
make this like golf you can go so dark
and for that I suggest this Mac lip mix
in Burgundy and then it's the most
gorgeous dark deep red burgundy color
ever it's way darker in the pot that on
the skin I mean how gorgeous would that
be with this looks I also love to mix a
little bit of belladonna by OCC into the
mix to make it a little bit more purple
or just belladonna alone for a really
nice bright purple lip but for what I'm
wearing right now this is Miss a
lipstick by Mac which is sort of like a
dead lip color for dead people base
please I would describe the color as
being a zombie in the walking dead but
you got lucky and you became like a
pretty zombie and you can still wear
miss and then on the like the middle I
like the inside of my lip I put this OCC
lip tar in digital lists and then I
recently saw Peter Lutz new video and he
did a really cool trick with like a
highlighter on this Cupid's bow and like
right there so I did that with my
whisper of guilt extra dimension skin
finished by Meg I put that on my Cupid's
bow and then also here in the middle
saying is that completes this tutorial
featuring the sleek ultra Metz dark
palate and the colors are insanely
pretty I love everything you could go
really dark like I did today you can go
really lightly so this is definitely a
must
