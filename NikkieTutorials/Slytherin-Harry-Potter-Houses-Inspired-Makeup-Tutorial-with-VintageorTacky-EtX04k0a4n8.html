tacky Korra are going to do the second
installment of the Harry Potter houses
inspired series and today vintage or
tacky is doing the Gryffindor look and I
am doing the Slytherin look and we both
decided to go really out with this look
we wanted to make it extreme we wanted
to make it like outgoing high fashion
catwalk photography makeup so today I'm
silly right now when I think of Southern
I think of these dark mysterious bad
girl to like have nothing but evil in
their system and they want to they want
to kill you and they want to know wanna
they wanna kids fold them more probably
um this is not wearable for outside the
house I will not do grocery shopping
with this I will not go to my grandma to
say hi with this also don't forget to
follow Lord and then a low stripe
Voldemort 7 on Twitter oh my god I swear
to God
Lord Voldemort 7 is tough 20 on Twitter
you like he's like Lord Voldemort he's
my master I love you thank you guys for
watching and I will see what that song
they're just bad with the fact that I
look like a freakin to split personality
person today we're not applying the base
like we always do to prevent it from
creasing because in the end I'm just
going to put a gloss on it to make a
crease but um today we're going to use
two base to make the colors pop and
stick to the lid so the first step is
immediately going to make you look crazy
so the first step is to apply a green
dark shimmery shadow to the lower part
of your eye
um yes the lower part of your eyes so
I'm going to grab Mac's humid and we're
going to apply this under our eyes so
we're just going to take the color on
the 224 and then just do this just go
under your eye go all the way in and go
down do not be scared to go down with
this now we're going to do some extreme
definition into the crease um with
photography and like photo shoots it's
really pretty when you apply your crease
color right here it makes on the Patriot
it makes it so freakin gorgeous so with
Mac's which I found just going to grab
my 226 my Sigma and I'm going to go into
the color and you want that applied is
under your brow bone like the beginning
of your brow you want to make like a
depth thingy right there then blend it
over under your brow even further you
can go down as well then just um make it
darker right here it really brings that
depth into your eye and it really makes
on photos it's beautiful now with the
same wedge color in the same brush I'm
going to go on to Mike
a little bit above the crease actually
just make it more smoky and smoldering
and you can connect it with that part
right here that you just made now I'm
going to grab some jumbo pencil in milk
by NYX and just put this onto the lid
just a little bit to make the darker
color stick to it then I'm going to take
Amex embark and with a 239 I'm just
going to put it onto all lid and a
little bit up into the crease
you can even take that 226 and go into
embark and just put this into the crease
there for the brow bone highlight I'm
going to take vanilla by Mac and with my
239 or 275 by Sigma I'm going to apply
that put it alone and also apply this
right here and to the inner corners of
your eyes now we're going back to the
lower lid I'm going to grab this on to
14 by Sigma I'm going to go into M mark
first and I'm going to smoke this a
little bit more closely to my lashline
and of course don't be scared to smudge
it a whole way down then I like to take
my 219 my Sigma and go a little bit more
into embarq and smoke it more down then
I like to make it even darker with a
2-14 brush and carbon my Mac which is a
black now you can reapply some of the
unit with the 224 and to make that blend
nicely you're just going to take this to
27 and smoke the edges out and for a
nice highlight under to agree I'm going
to grab aqua vert by Mac so I'm just
going to apply that right under that
humid back to the lid and we're going to
make that even darker with carbon the
black onto the lid now you can do
whatever your I smoke it a little bit
more and make it a little bit darker now
because fluid Lorena's green and silver
I'm just going to
some silver glitter ish type stuff to
that Vanilla's thought we made so I'm
going to grab this makeup studio shine
jewel effects and I'm just gonna it has
a really real it but I'm just going to
put my finger on to itch knock it over
and then you have some to your finger
and then pop this right in that inner
corner then I apply some black tech
fluid line to the waterline and some
mascara and don't be neat with the
mascara doll if you like make some
smudges all of your eyes that's it's
perfect now that you look like a
mentally unstable person you're going to
lighten up the lips it's gonna grab my
um let me raise my Mac I'm just applied
and then I'm going to apply some cram
divot lipstick on top from Mac then I'm
going to make that a little bit more
alive with this Ben Nye creme Rouge
wheel and I'm going to grab this color
right here that color just a little
teeny bit and just get that on top so
