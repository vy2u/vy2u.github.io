with one of my all-time favorite
youtubers Chloe Morello it's a huge
honor to be collabing with her today so
today we decided to come up with a
summer versus winter tech because
Australia is summer right now it's
actually bloody hot there I've heard
Chloe
is there in Australia in summer and I am
here in Holland where it's winter so we
thought it would be really fun to sort
of do her sort of side of the world with
summer so a summer look and sort of my
world world half of the world winter
Holland definitely go check out Chloe's
summer video as well you can click on it
right here she looks so starting so
definitely go check out her video and
subscribe to Chloe and give her love so
yeah without any further ado if you want
to know how to get my winter look then
please keep on watching so the first
thing you want to do is apply a baster
I'll it's you prevent the eyeshadow from
creasing and for that I'm using my Mac
soft ochre Paint Pot okay now I'm going
to take my bubbly Brown rich chocolate
pellet and I will be using these two
colours to bring in some depth in my
crease so just take a really nice big
fluffy brush and start defining your
crease a bit so try to keep your crease
as nice and soft and blended as you can
now from a little reckon zip palette I'm
going to take a little bit of unspoken
and unbridled and width adding on the
smoke of my lower lash line
and I'm gonna go quite heavy on this
part because I love it when smokey eyes
have that really sort of grungy edgy
feeling by going like really far down
then with an angled brush bring it in
all the way to the inner corner but
leave a really small gap open for a
highlight later on now with a pencil
brush go in this light color from the
bubbly Brown palette and with this kind
of smoke it down and make it more grungy
now I'm gonna take unspoken and
unbridled again and with that I'm gonna
connect
bottom to the crease by just flicking it
in there and also bring a little bit
more definition into the outer part of
the crease right here and now with a
brush
softly start blending that so you see
that sort of harsh line right there you
want to make that soft by blending it
now for that stunning lid color I'll be
using illamasqua or pigment and I'm
actually going to mix that with
illamasqua stealing Jalen oh just look
at that oh my gosh that is so stunning
oh I want to take a bath in this it's so
gorgeous okay so once you got that take
another brush and go in the pigment dry
and then Pat this on top and really Pat
it on because or dry is sort of like a
really dusty glittery pigment so you
don't want fallout with that because
then your entire face will be covered
with glitter and you don't want that so
for this really cool denim blue eyeliner
I took my Mac acrylic paint in Mereen
ultra so I'm gonna make my eyeliner with
this and then to set it because these
can sort of dry release sticky for that
I will be using this eyeshadow right
here I've talked about it before in
tutorials um I don't know where it got
this room and I don't know the brand all
I know is that it says mystery and
literally all you want to do is make a
really sick winged out eyeliner okay so
this is sort of what it looks like and I
take that shadow and set it and that
will deepen it up a little bit more as
well
and I'm going to take my Lancome lecrae
on coal in black coffee for the
beautiful inner corner highlight it will
be taking my illamasqua sealing gel
again and then take this pigment this is
by diamond effects and this is the
gemstone collection and this is the gold
stone so again make a mixture and apply
that to the very inner corners of your
eyes
so I already did some contouring to my
face and for that I used my trusty old
illamasqua eyeshadow in heroine I only
had this for about two months and I've
already hit pan that is how much I love
it and then to put some warmth back into
my face I use my Illamasqua blush in
disobey just to sort of buff out their
contour and give me some warm okay then
for blush I think it would be really fun
to sort of pair these really intense
deep eyes with a little bit of color so
I'm going to take my Illamasqua blush in
naked rose now for highlighting I'm
going to take my latest obsession which
is Mac's extra dimension eye shadow in a
natural flirt it's like a vanilla
pigment but a little bit more warm and
it's it's oh okay and now something I've
learned from a drag queen here on
YouTube is miss fame and what she does
is place sort of like a mini dot of
highlighter with a pencil brush on the
very highest tip of your nose and then
will just make your nose look so cute
and and small so with a pencil brush I'm
gonna take max a silver dusk iridescent
powder and then just place that little
dot right here on the highest point of
my nose and a little bit on the bridge
of the nose as well look at that look at
that that is so totally cute so for this
look I want all the attention to go to
my eyes and that sort of denim blue
eyeliner so I'm going to keep the lips
very nude and natural and what I'm going
to use for that is I'm first going to
line them out with my favorite Bobby
Brown pale pink lip liner so just to
sort of give myself a little bit more
body then as a lipstick I'm going to Pat
a little bit of Illamasqua obey on top
and this is a really beautiful sort of
Barbie peachy color and then an take a
loss this is also a new obsession
this is Rimmel London's apocalypse lip
glass in phenomenon and it's just the
perfect new color
and that guy's completes my part of the
