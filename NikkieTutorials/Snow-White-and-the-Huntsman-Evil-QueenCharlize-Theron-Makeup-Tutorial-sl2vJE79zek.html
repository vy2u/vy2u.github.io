hey guys so today I am going to do a
tutorial inspired slash recreated by
Charlize Theron in Snow White and the
Huntsman 2012 I first of all Kristen
Stewart how could you do this - I
actually no I don't care all my eyes
were looking at this movie were at
Charlize Theron I love her when I grow
up I want to be Shirley's she is
gorgeous I was like every time she was
on screen I was it go lesbian I'm gonna
be a lesbian from now on no shame I love
the sort of wings
smoky eye that she was rocking the
entire movie um I love her and this
video is dedicated to her and her role
as the Evil Queen I even got me a sort
of crown a evil crown Etsy is your best
friend if you want things like this
without any further ado if you want to
know how I got this Evil Queen look from
Snow White and the Huntsman then please
keep on watching so of course the first
thing you want to do is apply a base
your eyelids to prep the eyeshadow from
creasing and I am using my Mac soft
ochre Paint Pot the first colors I will
be using for my crease are mixed kid and
cross cultural with the two I'm just
going to start defining my crease and I
like to go all the way in just because
my eyes are slightly hooded and I find
that when I go all the way in they just
look slightly more I don't know open and
more defined
now take cross-cultural only and blend
this along the outer part of your lower
lash line and you're just going to wing
that out following your lash line and
this is going to be your wing for the
shape of the look now going to match
that with my crease and that is our wing
and now I'm going to take kid only and
I'm going to make the edges of this
crease super duper pretty and blended
you do not want it to be this harsh
because then it will look like a cheap
queen she's a classy evil queen with a
nicely blended crease that's where she
is also right here with that wing make
sure it's not too harsh you want it to
be a pretty wing I'm going to take a
bigger blending brush and blend that
even more and just make sure that it's
really nice and soft but it still has a
beautiful wing now I'm also going to run
cross-cultural along my lash line sort
of thick on the outer corners to give it
a more smoky effect I'm not going to use
Mac's museum bronze pigment I'm going to
blend that on the inner part of my lid
blending up into the crease and going
towards the like sort of beginning of my
iris and I'm also going to blend some of
the outer part sort of on the other side
of my iris and then blend it to the
middle and into your crease for my
eyelid i'm using this crush metal
pigment by Mac called Aloha and I'm
taking it comes with um sort of a
lighter side on top a sort of topi
lighter side and a darker taupe and I'm
going to use the darker one and I'm
going to put that onto the middle of my
eyelid and blending into the museum
bronze pigments for my brow bone
highlight I am using mixed chamomile
eyeshadow the bottom the bottom for my
bottom lash line I'm using Mick's rump
I'm just going to smoke this along my
lower lash line giving it a beautiful
Goldy bronzy smoke this thingy for my
inner corner I am using a bit of nylon
eyeshadow for my waterline I'm using my
Urban Decay 24/7 glide-on eye pencil in
zero make that nice and black just like
Kristen Stewart's heart and I'm going to
curl my lashes with my shoe or a eyelash
curler and I'm going to apply some
mascara and the one I'm using is my
makeup studio what aprove 3d extra black
so I already did my cheeks prior to
filming and the products I used were for
contouring
is my NYX blush in taupe because I
always use that as a contour and to warm
up and bronze my face a little bit more
I used my Illamasqua blush in disobey um
and Shirley's skin is actually pretty
bronzed in the movie although it's all
about being fair in some parts of the
movie she's really really bronzed I'm
like what is the point of this movie
anyways for blush I use the gorgeous Mac
warm Sol blush this is a key item
everyone should have it and of course
because you know I love my glowy healthy
skin I used my neck extra dimension skin
finish in suburb and I put that on my
cheekbones right there formulas are
first going to define them a little bit
more and I just I'm going to use the oak
lip pencil by Mac
now I'm going to take max lip mix in mid
tone nude and just Pat this over your
entire lip and that guy's completes my
Evil Queen from Snow White and the
Huntsman 2012 2012 look I love Charlie's
in the movie and I'm a big big fan of
hers so this was all dedicated to her in
the movie and um so yeah if you want a
