I'm doing a tutorial on a runway show
from me you me you I have no idea when
it was I just saw a picture online and I
fell in love with it it was this really
soft clean eye and bright bamming
booming gizumon cumin mmm red lips sweet
- guys try to recreate that look and if
you want to know how I got this entire
like good for cooker if you want to know
how I did this then please keep on
watching so the first thing you want to
do with really bright red lips is to
keep everything on the rest of her face
really neutral because um unless you're
going for that look you can go for like
heavy smoky eyes lots of blush eyebrows
lips and all the stuffs and all the
magenta but I really love the cleanest
and the like um like rest you put in the
face when you only apply like a strong
lip and like the rest is really natural
so the first thing I'm gonna do is
another take my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot
soda palette we're using today is the
Naked palette from Urban Decay I finally
got my hands on it and fern eyes I'm
just gonna keep it really simple I'm
only using two colors and the main color
we're using is smog that one now I'm
gonna do is they connect 239 go into
smog and put that on to the lid then I'm
going to take a 217 my Sigma and blend
that into the crease
I'm going to take a Mac 224 and go into
naked I'm just gonna blend that above
the smog just to keep it just to give
the eye a little bit more depth we're
pretty low really it's really easy I'm
just gonna take smog again and put that
on the lower lash line as well and go
about half way in look for that really
nice inner corner highlight I'm going to
take been nice
looks powder penguin in ice I got a
hitch hey Mary I'm just gonna take my
pinky and dip it into that ping mint and
all I'm gonna do is push that into that
inner corner right there then blend it
in a bit I can't put a waterline I'm
using a nude eyeliner pencil this is
Illamasqua zazow they quickly curl the
lashes this is my japonesque power
eyelash curler and then for mascara i'm
gonna use the max hot
oh-ho-ho 10 achi hot hotter naughty a
little trick to not get any mascara onto
your eyelids if you don't have any
eyeliner on is by just lifting your lid
up and start putting mascara at the
roots so once you let it down again you
don't have to do the roots anymore so
there's no way that you can touch the
lid okay what I always do with lips is
first completely erase your color to
make the lipstick or the lip liner that
you put on top pop I already applied
some Megillah the pen poured the first
thing we want to use for direct lips is
the rat lip pencil from neck read from
it so all I'm gonna do is align my lips
and fake it a little
in words
okay so once you got that I'm gonna make
a mixture between mix or Ruby woo lips
and to make it just a little bit more
bright I'm gonna take my axe or Nick's
ear Ross eros eros and all you want to
do is just apply it over your entire lip
liner and the rest of your lip so that
ladies and gents completes this um you
you emails runway inspire look it's just
a really easy I and just really bright
booming burning bright red lips print

know my blush there and all the other
stuff in it that's on me today thank you
