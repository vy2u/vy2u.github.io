my February hits and God knows and I was
rocking this look right here and I got
so many tutorial requests for this that
I actually was kind of blown away by it
I was like so many people want to see a
video on this I can't handle can't deal
can't no so it's taking me a couple of
weeks on finally getting around on doing
this tutorial but today I'm finally here
to do it for you so today I'll be
showing you how to get these soft smokey
eyes with a copper liner which I really
like and then of course the purple lips
so yeah if you want to know how to get
this copper sparkle eyes with purple
lips and then please keep on watching so
I already prime my eyelids using my Mac
soft ochre Paint Pot and now I'm going
to start sculpting the crease using this
color from my Bobbi Brown rich chocolate
palette so I'm just softly going to
start building that up in the outer part
of my crease and then slowly start
working to the middle of my crease and
then whatever is left towards the inner
part of the crease and I'm going to
blend that out using this color from
that same Bobbi Brown palette and just
using soft windshield wiper motions I'm
diffusing the edges for the bottom I'm
going to take my lorac unzipped palette
and for that amazing unspoken and I'm
applying this to the entire lower lash
line and I'm being quite you know
vigorously with it I'm going to blend it
in all the way and I'm also not afraid
of blending that down so really sinking
that eye in and making it look smoky and
sultry and sexy and then I like to take
a little bit more of the color and then
connect the bottom to the crease really
simple like that and then going back in
with my blending brush and giving all a
seamless blend we're the little going
into that same unzipped palette and with
taking unattainable and undiscovered and
I'm just mixing them
with my fingers and then with the
fingers go to the eyes now quickly I'm
going to highlight my inner corners
using under cover and just back it on
there and blend out of course now
quickly apply in some Ben Nye
neutralizer cream crayon in ultra light
across the water lines and now for the
star of the show I'll be taking next
pigment in copper Sparkle which is so so
so gorgeous and to make it a liquid
eyeliner you need a mixing medium and
for that I'll be using my Illamasqua
sealing gel and then mix it around and
today have a nice little mixture alike
bath and then start applying that as a
liquid liner on to the eyes and I'm
going all the way in with this and quite
thick as well because I love the drama
and I'm not going to wing it or anything
I'm just going to go all the way to the
outer edge here and then just kind of
end it of course if you want you can add
a wing do all kinds of crazy stuff with
it but I just really like that sort of
pop of copper there and all you want to
do now is the Python mascara after that
and I'm going to do now is apply some
mascara and for that I'll be using my
makeup studio waterproof 3d extra black
and my Mac extended play gigablack lash
okay so for the cheeks I already did
some contouring and it is my Alaska
eyeshadow in heroine for that to further
bronze up my face I use my Alaska
disobey blush and then now for the blush
I'm going to make a nice mixture between
this blush ombre by Mac called Azalea
blossom and a tiny tiny bit of currently
sub blush by benefits and that looks
like that and just you know the apples
of the cheeks I'm barely putting
anything on I just want all the
attention to go to the eyes and the lips
so and I really want to give my
complexion that beautiful glow a shine
so for that I'll be using my pigment by
Mac called vanilla nose up darling what
is with all the drag forces today I
don't know I feel like Alaska and then
also okay and then for the absolute
start of this video the purple lipstick
it's going to be illamasqua SPSP
lipstick and it's so absolutely stunning
and I love wearing this and that is
exactly the lipstick that I was wearing
in my February hits and God knows I'm
gonna apply this with a brush which is
totes groundbreaking
and that guy's completes his fun and
easy copper eyes and purple lips
