on this look right here okay so first I
wanted to do really really soft eyes all
about the lashes and then he come out
BAM lip but as I was recording this
video and I did my eyes and I applied
the lashes out of nowhere
glitter came around the corner you know
glitter is always near when I'm around
let's be honest so out of nowhere
I applied silver glitter to my lower
lashline I kind of started living for
that by the time I had to do my cabal
bam bright lip I was like no I'm not in
the mood to do a Kabam bright bow lip
right now so out came this very soft and
nici terms angelic glitter lashes you D
look see the previous two episodes of
winter wonder we kept in such glam like
I literally threw the glam at your face
and today we're gonna take it down a
couple of notches and keep it more soft
and super super easy anyone can do this
I'm telling you anyone can do this face
yeah episode number three of winter
wonder week is gonna be all about simple
soft and gellick glam if you want to
know how to get this makeup look right
here then keep on watching so of course
we're going for that flawless finish
today and instead of always going for my
Nivea men aftershave balm today I'm
going to mix things up a little bit and
show you different options so the first
product I'm going in with is by Marc
Jacobs and this is the invisible
undercover perfecting coconut primer and
what I personally love about this primer
is that it feels a little bit more thick
and you really feel it hydrating your
skin and therefore it makes it perfect
for drier skin and it just really gives
it that luxurious feel to apply makeup
to to minimize the appearance of my
pores I'm gonna go in with this Tarte
clean slate primer and I'm going to tap
this into my skin because I've been
watching desi Perkins all morning and
she loves this stuff and she told me to
patch this in instead of
i'ma follow you boo since my skin is
going to be such a huge feature of this
look I wanted to be flawless so I love
changing things up just not these sticks
so I'm going to go back into my makeup
forever
Ultra HD foundation Stix I love them
ride or die and that is what I'll be
using to achieve a flawless base so
again folks outer perimeter 120 inner
117 blend in using your Beauty Blender
for concealer I'll use another writer
dye it cosmetics bye bye under-eye in
light and like I said skin will be such
a big feature of this look so go ahead
and highlight with that concealer and
really get it to an A+
so really now also using it as a
highlighter and again you know it so I
like to do everything first and then my
eyes last don't know why let it work for
me
so from the lowest point of where you
applied the concealer work your way up
towards your eye and I really buff it in
now you want to set your under ice using
powder to prevent it from creasing we
call it baking
and then I also like to bake the size of
my nose because I get shiny they're like
1.2 seconds so mama needs to Bank get
all up in there baby
and now would be the time to do your
brows and that's exactly what I'm going
to do right now off-camera okay so the
eye look is super minimal but we still
want it to look flawless so first I'm
going to prime using my soft ochre Paint
Pot by Mac and for this I'm using a
sigma 3d HD precision brush now I'll be
taking the lightest shade from the urban
decay naked smoky palette and that is
called 13 and with a zueva 220 brush I'm
just going to buff that all over my
crease and brow bone area now taking
that same 13 color and mixing it with
the shimmery lightest shade high and
with a zoeva 234 I'm applying that all
over the lid
for the crease that we mixing two shades
from the Too Faced chocolate bonbons
pellet and the colors we'll be using our
pick and prolly nee or something like
that and almond truffle and I'm blending
this in the crease using an Anasazi
Beverly Hills blending brush for the
inner corners I'll first apply a layer
of NYX jumbo pencil in milk and set that
using Mac's
eyeshadow in nylon to open up the eye
I'll be applying the color puff cream
gel liner in exit to my waterline not to
help hide the line of the lash band I'm
applying the tiniest line of eyeliner
just on the inner third of the roots of
my lashes
after lashes I'll be using these true
beauties right here these are by head of
beauty and they are called Raquel
and then really lift him using your
fingers by pushing at the base of the
lash and then the front kind of push
tray forward so it doesn't go up as much
because I like these lashes better when
the front is more straight outwards and
the outer corners more up so you get
they're really nice with my Urban Decay
heavy metal glitter liner in glam rock I
just add a couple of glitters to my
lower lash line
okay first thing I'm gonna do for cheeks
is contour because tis the season to
look sculpted as and for this I'll
be using NYX taupe blush and with a new
favorite brush this is my morphe and is
the m5 3-0 and I just randomly used this
for yesterday's video like during
filming inside I was dying because the
contour went on so good so again that's
the morphe m5 310 and if you use the
code Nikki you'll get some dollars off
so soft
really just buffs that contour in so
softly so nicely love the thrush then to
give my face some warmth I'm using the
Too Faced milk chocolate bronzer and
applying it with a Mac 135
for highlighter today I'll be mixing my
two favorites
number one pearl by Becca of course and
secondly the UH Nastasia triple eels
illuminator in starlight and together
this will make a softer version of the
pearl with the still ball mass and using
it with my new favorite highlighter
brush you saw it yesterday this is the
morphe m3 10 I'm telling you a
highlighter will never look as good
Ready Set glow
oh I am dead I am done I am slayed
goodbye doesn't so fast to him like up
up elbow
for blush I'll be using my aura powder
by Sigma in nymphaea and the Sigma
spotlight destra f 37 brush my favorite
blush brush and just blend it in with
that contour and highlight right in
between and then diffuse the edges and
then lastly you want to spritz your face
using a makeup setting spray to get rid
of all the excessive powder and look
even more glowy and for this up using
the Mario Badescu skincare facial spray
rosewater facial spray because I want to
keep this look very natural and soft and
really all the attention to those crazy
lashes and the glitter underneath the
eyes I'm going to go for a nude and
first I'll be lining my lips using
world--it pencil by Mac
okay now we're going to fill in using
pure Hollywood liquid lipstick by
Anasazi Beverly Hills
and then overtop milkshake liquid
lipstick goodbye on the slopes of
Beverly Hills as well and that guys
