which is totally inspired by Valentine's
Day I wanted to do a classic Valentine's
Day look but with the twist so instead
of going for that pin appear a lip and
the black liner I went for it's smudged
out glittery pink eyeliner a little bit
of elongation on the inner corners a
beautiful matte red lip and glowy skin
to seduce no dates if you have a
Valentine's date and it's the first time
you're meeting make sure you go swimming
to show how impressive your makeup
skills are cuz it seems always want to
do nowadays on the first day just go
swimming in a wet bitch you take me
swimming cuz I got my waterproof makeup
setting spray come for my face we good
we got this face on forever with all
jokes aside I am really excited about
this look today I hope you are too and
if you would like to know how to get
this Valentine's Day in Niki terms soft
look then keep on watching alright the
first thing I'll be doing is priming my
face using my Nivea men aftershave balm
which I know is sold out in a lot of
places now but just wait for it to come
back at base for foundation today I'm
again going for the ex1 cosmetics invisi
wear and a lot of you seem to like this
foundation on me in the previous videos
I'm using it again I love this one I did
get a lot of questions asking how I made
it work this entire range of foundations
has a warm golden yellow undertone to it
which my face is pink but the rest of my
body has a yellow undertone so it works
out so the lightest one f-100 is by far
the most neutral one but it still has a
strong more yellow golden warm undertone
I love using this foundation you know
I've seen so many gurus use it all the
time and I never knew how to get it to
my destination in Holland but there's
finally a website that ships it
internationally for free and that
website is called look fantastic calm so
if you really want to try out the ex1
metics
invisible foundations and you have the
skin tone for it go give it a try
in a little trick of - when the base
foundation is a little bit too dark you
can always delight in the entire complex
up with a lighter concealer for
concealer and use the tarte maracuja
creaseless concealer in fair and mixing
that with a little tiny teeny bit of
Kryolan TV pin stick in 0-0 and blending
in using my Beauty Blender
I'm going to bake using mine our soft
velvet loose powder in snow
four eyes then priming using my Mac soft
ochre Paint Pot for the crease I'll be
using Barcelona Beach by makeup geek
cosmetics and lending this in with a Mac
224 brush for the little using Mac's
vanilla pigment
and also playing a tiny bit on the inner
corners from the morphe 35o palette and
then start up with this hot pink right
here we're going to smudge it out using
this beautiful pink right next to it and
a zoeva 240 brush and with that angled
brush I'm creating a soft wing and again
also blending that out over top of the
pink smudged out Langer I'm now applying
this Urban Decay heavy metal glitter
liner in Jung show for the lower lash
line I'm taking Barcelona Beach again
and that's same small 240s away the
brush with tarts so fine micro liner I'm
going to add a tiny bit of a black point
to my inner corners to elongate the eye
to finish off the look all you need is
some falsies and I'm using the Elevation
lashes in a thrive oh for
all right for cheeks the first thing I'm
going to do is of course contour because
you want to look snatched on your date
for this I'm going to use the Kevyn
Aucoin
sculpting powder in medium and I'm
contouring using my favorite more if you
brush the morphe M 534 blush I'll be
using the ex1 cosmetics blush in natural
flesh which I think goes perfectly with
this entire look and I like these
luscious I use the peach one in I think
two videos ago and I really like the
pigmentation plus your cheap which is
nice so with a Cosette number two brush
I'm just gonna spark up my cheeks a
little bit more that's a beautiful color
and for highlighter today for the
beautiful Valentine's Day glow and then
I used crushed pearl by Anasazi briefly
Hills and also highlighting the tip of
my nose and my Cupid's bow
and lastly following through with a
little bit of makeup forever missed it
fixed
for lips I'm going to go for the classic
match red and I just got this color in
this is Jeffrey star Red Rum and perfect
color perfect color so that is going on
my mouth
like that and that guy's concludes a
soft Valentine's Day makeup look with a
twist I hope you enjoyed for a full list
