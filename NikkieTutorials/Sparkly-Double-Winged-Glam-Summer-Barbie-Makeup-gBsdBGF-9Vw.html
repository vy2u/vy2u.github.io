tutorial on this makeup look right here
this is a double winged sparkly double
winged eye makeup with glitter and then
the super fun summery lip and glowy skin
it's what I like to call like a fun
glamorous summer party makeup look
something looks like that to me so this
is also the look I was wearing in my
hit's and God knows my previous video so
I got you yeah so without any further
ado if you want to know how to get this
makeup look right here then please keep
on watching alright the first I'm going
to do is apply a base to my eyelids to
prevent everything from creasing
and I'm using my soft ochre Paint Pot by
Mac in my crease I'll be applying a
mixture of two eyeshadows the first one
is by honest all separably hope the nail
it just it just broke the wound is fresh
the first eyeshadow I'll be using is by
Anasazi Beverly Hills this is warm taupe
and mixing it with babyface by makeup
geek now this looks like such a light
color which it is but I'm like lightest
paper so on this this is a beautiful
transition shade and I'm applying this
mixture using my Sigma e35 and then with
warm taupe only I'm just deepening that
crease up a little bit more on the lid
I'll be applying this Inglot pigment
this is 180 and I'm applying this with a
damp brush
okay then for underneath I'm taking this
noir eyeshadow by Anasazi Berkeley Hills
so first I'm going to draw a line just
underneath my inner corner and then also
go ahead and connect it to the actual
lash line and then also on the outer
corner you just want to create a little
gap in between the top line and the
lower line and we haven't applied the
top line yet but you know what I'm
saying then just go ahead and fill in
that entire lower lash line then to
soften that line I'm taking warm taupe
again and just going right underneath to
smoke it out a little bit now time for
the top line I'm just going to go for a
half eyeliner so I'm gonna make my wing
go halfway in and stop there this is a
great way for hooded eyelids because it
actually leaves space open to be seen
instead of eyeliner only so just wing it
and go about half way in and then I fill
that in using my black liquid liner by
NYC okay now for it in between on the
blank spots I'm going to take this heavy
metal glitter liner by Urban Decay this
is Midnight Cowboy and this is going
right in between the lines
okay now a newt liner on the waterline
I'm gonna do this off camera because I
can't do it on camera because I will put
my eyes out now on two lashes the false
lashes I'll be using today are by Lena
lashes and these are the Leticia lashes
all right the first thing I'm going to
do for cheeks today is contour as always
I'm using my caveny shade and light
palette for this for bronzer my Tarte
Park s princess contour palette in
number one that's the bronzer do they
sell this one individually because the
highlighter broke out of my palate and I
and the blush is pretty but I don't care
about it too much I really want to get
the brands are individually for blush
I'm going to use a little bit of
gorillas group girl ass peach boy blush
I'm going to make a mixture between
between the two and to highlight my
Becca shimmering skin perfecter purest
in moonstone because we all will glow oh
why does highlighting make everything on
earth okay like a okay like you could
throw highlighter on Pooh and I'd be
like oh the glistening the first thing
for the lips I'm going to do is line
them using my NYX lip pencil in natural
looks like I'm going to put it over top
is uh Nastasia Beverly Hills liquid
lipstick and this is the color baby pink
and that guy's concludes this double
wing to sparkly double winged summer
party look so for a full list if every
