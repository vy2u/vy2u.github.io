on this look right here I felt like
doing something different I said stick
last week and that's why I missed my
Sunday upload I'm so sorry about that
I was so sick and I still have a cold
but I'm back I survived I didn't have to
say I'll be back because I'm already
back so I was watching all these makeup
tutorials in bed had nothing else to do
and I was inspired to create these grey
sparkly purple smokey eyes and then
these darker nude gray toned lip um I
dick it feels absolutely great to be
back so without any further ado if you
would like to know how to get this look
right here then please keep on watching
for eyes the first thing I'll be doing
is applying a base to my lids to prevent
everything from creasing and for this
I'm using my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot
and I'm applying this using a zoeva
concealer buffer brush then with a
morphe m-5 13 and the Stila eyes are the
window shadow palette in mind I'm taking
this taupey color right here and this is
going right into the crease from inner
to outer corner and you just want to
build up the intensity especially since
this is going to be our only crease
color then pick up a little bit more and
concentrated on the outer part of the
lid plus the outer portion of the crease
from the same palette I'm mixing the
taupe with the brownish color right
underneath and for this I'm using a more
feet m5 11 and just to blend it out and
get a transition color in my crease I'm
also going to pop that taupey color on
the inner third of my lid
and on the center of the lid I'm going
to take this Stila magnificent
magnificent metal foiled eyeshadow in
rose quartz metallic rose quartz and at
first just applying that as a base right
in the center where we don't have
anything on yet and then over top I'm
going to apply on the styles in Beverly
Hills pink champagne eyeshadow right
over top and that really makes pink
champagne pop and stick because of that
base with the rose quartz metallic rose
quartz and then blend the edges in and
you have this fantastic lid highlight
that was a morphe M 507 I'm just going
to blend in that highlighting color with
the taupe color a little bit more for
the lower lash line of taking my morphe
35o brush i'm going to make a mixture
between these two purple shades right
here and this is going from outer to
inner corner with a damp brush
intensifying the outer lower lashline
corners with this purpley blue color
all that is left to do now is highlight
the inner corners and for this I'm
taking the foiled eyeshadow by makeup
geek called whimsical
all I'm going to do now to finish off
the look is a place of mascara and
falsies and false it's double using
today are by lena lashes and these are
called kendall and if you use
nikkietutorials the code nikkietutorials
you'll get 50% off all right for cheeks
first i'm going to warm everything up
because i feel sick I need my bronzer
right now this is Mac's mineralize
skinfinish in give me Sun which I
definitely need my son
I feel like plenty of bronzer and warmth
to the skin really does this look a lot
of justice because I feel like these
eyes can be quite draining so bring that
warmth back in really helps making this
look more wearable yes I don't know what
it was going to say there for my contour
I'll be using my cats and D shade and
light palette and I'm using these two
shades wait note these two shades right
here
for blush I'm going to use my trusty
guerrilla golden high blush and then of
course the finish to face some
highlighter and I'm using my memory lou
manizer by the balm come through
highlighter about what's being at the
general emma was gonna follow em for
lips at first aligning my lips using my
NYX natural lip pencil
then from lipstick I'm going to use this
color pop liquid lipstick in trap

cool toned purple smokey eyes and lips
