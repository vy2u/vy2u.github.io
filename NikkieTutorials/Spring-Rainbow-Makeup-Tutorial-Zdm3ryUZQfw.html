sort of like a rainbow spring look it is
pretty damn out there it is bright it is
not for the people who are subscribed to
me for like the natural looks
oh and I'm not bald I have hair I just
painted out though today this is sort of
like an editorial fashion bright spring
makeup this could be worn into summer as
well and if you're daring enough you can
wear this to like grocery shopping but
it wouldn't recommend it if you want to
know how I got this look then please
keep on watching
so the first thing I'm going to do is
apply a base to my eyelids do you
prevent this entirely crazy eyeshadow
from creasing plus the colors will pick
up better and they they show better the
one I'm using is soft ochre Paint Pot
from Mac and I'm gonna apply some NYX
milk jumbo pencil as well the first
eyeshadow I will be using is after party
from sugarpill
and this is going to the outer half of
my lower lid so just if you like cut it
in in-between like in the half who want
to do the outer have blue now I'm going
to make a mixture between sugar pills
Midori as in the sleek asset palette I'm
going to take the neon green color and
that is going onto the other half that
has nothing on it yet so like the inner
half of the lower lid and then blend the
two together
Mac's alumi eyeshadow this is going to
be very inner corners of the eyes and
then blend it with the green as well now
I'm gonna take next kid eyes shadow and
with a really big brush I'm gonna give
some shadow to like the part of my nose
so like the bone that goes to your nose
I'm gonna enhance that and make a shadow
there this is a technique that is used a
lot in like fashion industry because it
gives that really nice a model eye this
is sugar pills poison plum I'm going to
go into my crease and go like halfway in
as well
I'm going to make it a little bit
thicker and bigger I'm going to make an
eyeliner with poison plum as well and
you can make it quite thick
now with the blending brush I'm going to
blend this out and make it even more
extreme I'm also going to go into a
point to goop that really nice oven
guard like fashion feeling and he was
kind of blended out
this is sugar pills fling points and
that is going into this very inner
corner right here really enhancing that
like trick that they use a lot in the
fashion industry by doing that inner
part of the eye as well
closer to no sign and then of course
blend it out now with the purple I'm
just kind of gonna mimic this shape that
I have going on than the other eye so
just make it a little bit more extreme
and winged out and blend with that
orange that we just edit I'm also going
to blend this outer corner with the
purple okay and as you can see that this
top part is so much more blended than on
the other eye so what I'm gonna do is
just make this softer and blend it all
out okay once you have blended that
you're gonna go back with some of the
colors to make them more vivid again
because blending can really tone down
some colors I'm gonna take my X jumbo
pencil in milk again I'm gonna apply the
two like the part that hasn't got any
way to color yet and blend that out of
course and then I'm gonna take the neon
yellow from my sleek asset palette and
that is going on top of that part right
there and once you meet that purple kind
of blended in now I'm going to take the
purple off the acid palette and go over
that eyeliner again and then also on
this outer part blend it through with
the yellow it's all about blending and
reapplying colors blending reapplying
colors blending reapplying colors
especially with bright looks like this
all you want to think about is blending
and reapplying colors for that really
nice strong look winged this blue bottom
thing up into the purple
a bit I'm just gonna give everything a
quick blend and reapply colors like we
did with the entire video for my
waterline I'm gonna take max chroma
graphic pencil and delicious and to
really make that stick I'm gonna use a
lighter quickly for a brow bone
highlight I'm going to use pink opal
pigment from Mac and this will give a
really nice texture to the wood because
this is like an iridescent like pinkish
sheen and I'm just adding that to like
the highest point of my arch and then
blend it out
okay I'm not quickly gonna curl my
lashes and apply some mascara and the
mascara I'm using is one a proof 3d
black by makeup studio you can apply
some false lashes I'm going to do this
because I like to look better with that
false lashes so I'm gonna do them at
scale right now and then I will be back
now if I was booked for it like
this with like really crazy eyes and
like LOI and shaped skin my normal go to
lip will be a really nice nude nude
don't for that I'm gonna use a max flash
pot lipstick this is my favorite new
lipstick and that completes his rainbow
spring look though yeah I think you guys
