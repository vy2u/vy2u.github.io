on st. Patrick's Day it's an inspired
one if you're going to celebrate st.
Patrick's Day I have a lot of fun and
let's go on to the tutorial and that was
like such a yeah that's good I always
make the worst faces in my life when I
do videos
so the first thing is always what you
want to do is apply a base to your
eyelids to prevent that I should of
increasing and the one I'm using is
always soft ochre Paint Pot for Mac okay
so the first color I'm going to use is
this one my Mac and this is called kid
and what you're going to do with kid is
just apply some definition to the crease
not too much just a little bit okay now
I'm going to take this beautiful product
by v-sign Pro and my mom actually sells
this this is of a extreme color art
paint it is a water activated sort of
paint product perfect for like a base
this is the earth green and what I'm
going to do with that is apply that as a
base to my eyelid and then with the soft
and fluffy brush you're going to blend
that up into the crease of it just to
soften the edges okay now I'm going to
make a mixture between Max's nails it
must and sugar pills Midori and I'm
going to apply those colors to the inner
and outer parts of my lid then with
those same colors I'm going to blend
those into my crease and I'm first
making a line and then from that line
I'm going to fill up my crease
I'm gonna take a bit of next femme
noubar and with that same brush just
make the crease a little bit darker the
crease only I'm gonna take velvet Moss
again and mix it with sour lemon and
then blend that above the entire lot I'm
gonna take this beautiful Inglot pigment
in number 84 and this has a really nice
duochrome to it and that is exactly what
we need and I'm gonna apply that to the
middle of my lid first is really packing
it on there and then slightly blending
it to the outer corners I'm gonna take
that first green aqua paint again and
what I'm going to do is start making a
line on my lower lid close to my lower
lash line I'm filling everything in and
then we're gonna create a liner from the
bottom so I'm gonna go up like that and
from that outer point go back into your
lid
and then with a q-tip make the end
softer now that brush with the pain wipe
that off of it and then smudge that
aligner
into the lid like so of course I'm going
to set that with some eyeshadows that we
use before and I'm actually going to
make a line towards the inner corner of
my eye but leave one little spot open
right there for a highlight
for an inner corner highlight I'm going
to take max a nylon eyeshadow and I'm
going to mix that with face fronts /
light highlighting powder in autofocus
this is an amazing product and place
that as an inner corner highlight now
I'm going to take this gosh Velvet Touch
eyeliner in green devil and that is
going on top of the waterline okay what
I'm gonna do now is curl my lashes with
my shoe
amaura eyelash curler and apply my
favorite mascara this is the mascara by
makeup studio called what approved 3d
extra black I'm you can apply fake
eyelashes I'm not going to biz my eyes
they are a bit hooded so when I apply
fake lashes you will not see the
gorgeous green shimmer on my lid so do
whatever you like I'm not going to do it
so I'll be right back
so for your lipstick can apply whatever
you like you can apply a bright bright
red you can apply a bright bright green
yellow orange or just a nude like I'm
going to do because I this is BAM and
this is this is supposed to be like I am
I just really wanted to go for bright
green eyes and soft mute lips so for my
lips I'm using Mac's fleshpot lipstick
this is one of my all-time favorite nude
lipsticks for girls with my skin tone
and then optional it why did I do the
piece on jasmine honey sheen supreme lip
glass by Mac this is a beautiful soft
shine not true ever going to do that if
I end up having shine in the intro and
the outro I did it so yeah guys that
