another snapchat inspired tutorial and
today I was inspired by the strawberry
makeup look can we just talk about the
fact that snapchat is killing these
filters right now they are so so good
the only thing I have an issue with
snapchat start adding lashes to these
filters they had these balm as makeup
looks and then they don't have lashes so
today I decided to take inspiration from
the strawberry makeup look from these
snapchat filters and because in my
previous life I was a drag queen um I
added lashes because I felt like big
luxurious of fact lashes just fitted
this look so much yeah I kind of took my
own spin on this look and had fun with
it and if you would like to try this
look at home then please keep on
watching alright so the first thing
we're gonna do for this look is block
out our brows why because in this
snapchat filter you can't really
determine a brow because it's covered by
the entire eye design so we're gonna
cover a brows so it's time for the
trusty old Elmer's glue stick we're just
gonna get rid of these and have all the
space we want to work with and blocking
brows is actually not as intimidating as
it looks all you need is a washable glue
toothbrush clean one please and a
blow-dryer okay so what we're going to
do is take the glue stick and brush our
hairs towards the center of her face and
then go back in and brush everything up
and nice and flat nice towards the
center of the face
then face and then go back in and brush
it up then you want to go in with your
toothbrush
now wait nice and flat on the surface of
your skin as flat as possible so by
following the direction of your hair you
can get it as flat as possible so
following the growth of the hair plate
flat in that direction like that and now
take your blow dryer and make a dry and
go back with another layer
okay so I glued down both brows and that
way you would do is set it with powder
so it locks it in place - just gonna
grab a powder puff and press the powder
in to that brow to lock in the glue for
foundation today I'm going to use my
trusty Make Up For Ever Ultra HD
foundation Stix I'm going to use 117 on
my brows and in a perimeter of the face
and 120 on the outer
and 120
and blending that in using my beauty
blender
and now what we're going to do is apply
some concealer / highlighter to bring
depths back into this face
and again you guessed it by now
and I'm going to set my under eye area
using my NARS powder and snow in
ascending the rest of my face using this
sephora powder
this brush by morphe has been really
changing my under eye setting area it's
the morphe 49 and it's just the perfect
density to set the remaining part of the
under eye area plus blend in the baked
in such a beautiful soft manner
oh this brush is doing it for me lately
alright so reporter brows got rid of
them did her base looking snatched and
flawless it's time for the strawberry
eye alright so I took one shot of my
face with the eyes without wearing any
makeup so I could really see what the
filter did to my face we're gonna start
off by creating our black wing I guess
but first base I know people always get
so excited when I use the base I never
used before today is not that day soft
ochre Paint Pot by Mac is going on my
eyes now because we need all the help we
can get in the blending department and I
take a white shadow this is one of the
palettes we'll be working with today
this is my morphe and this is the 35c
palette I'm just gonna grab the white
and because we're working with a larger
area I'm again going back in with a t-49
the one I really like we're just gonna
set all over baby
I think I'm going to start off with the
black liner which is very concentrated
on the inner corners but blurry on the
outer so let's do that and I'm again
using that 35c palette by morphe and I'm
going to go into this color right here
in the black and we just gonna wing it
so look up there then bring that back
into the lid
now going in with the morphe 35o b
palette which has all these amazing
bright colors that I'm obsessed and I'm
going to go in with this green color
right here on the lid as totally fine if
you mix it with the black for now
because we'll go back in with the black
later on and smudge it out and make it
perfect so we got this that lid baby and
now going back to the 35c palette and
grabbing this yellow the yellow is sort
of a center eye catcher so we're going
to apply to the center of the crease
here it gradually comes from the green
and now is the part where I can get a
little bit scary we're going to go in
with a red slash coral and that blending
wise can be a little intimidating so
we're going to start off with the
transition color from the 35 seed
palette let me go back into these two
shades right here and we're going to
start blending it onto the brow bone
mixing with the yellow kind of working
your way over onto the brow and
diffusing up and then from b35 beep how
I'm going to grab some of the reds and
really intensify it going back in with
the yellows to re intensify it and blend
with the red
okay now let's focus some more on that
liner so we're going to smudge it out
mainly on the outer corners here and
then now with my ardency in punk or rock
on liquid liner I'm going to create a
new inner corner alright and now with a
green we're going to add the Leafs
okay now with next liquid liner in white
I'm going to create the seeds
so to complete this eye look we need
some lashes so just in like my glitter
Lian tutorial they did not add lashes
and I did and for this look as well I'm
gonna add lashes and today I'll be going
for the scarlet lashes by hooded beauty
you know what very close if you ask me
alright so I quickly finished up my
other eye and what it also did is added
1/2 the inner half of my 301 lashes on
the outer corners because I just feel
like that really transforms the look I
also added one more lash because I felt
like it needed another leaf lash and now
we're gonna go on to contouring so we're
gonna cut the cheeks cut the nose snatch
this face and sculpt like a goddess so
the brush I'll be using for this is my
morphe m5 30 which is my favorite
contouring brush and my capital guan
medium sculpting powder and I'm going to
go a little higher than I normally would
really snatch that face
for blushing coming up with a nice
peachy pink this right here is my maca
it's called what I fancy all right
believe it or not I'm not going to add
any glow to my cheeks because I like
them like this but I am going to add a
glow tube tip of my nose forehead
Cupid's bow just I might do it on my
cheeks anyway and if you're wondering
I'm using pearl by Becca now for lips
you want to go for the brightest almost
electric red you have in your collection
and kind of taper out the edges so I'm
going to go with these two by Oprah this
one right here is called ultimate red
and this one right here is called Venice
and together this will really pop and
I'm just going to apply it straight from
the wand and then with the brush taper
out the edges
