inspired by Harley Quinn from the new
movie Suicide Squad but I wanted this
look to almost be as if Harley was doing
some researching online for a night out
and she looked up her favorite makeup
tutorials so this is Harley Quinn but
glam this is Harley Quinn super glam for
a night out with the Joker and the
Suicide Squad I had so much fun creating
this look for you it's totally something
way different for me and yeah if you
want to know how I got this look right
here maybe for Halloween or for a
Suicide Squad party then please keep
watching all right so the first product
I'll be going in with is my glam glow
this is the glow starter in nude glow
this stuff is just amazing to make your
makeup just go on perfectly and flawless
but my favorite thing about this is that
it smells like an orange creamsicle just
it's like it when you open the spot it's
like summer and I want a creamsicle
right now I want my body to smell like
this so I'm dotting that onto my face
and then blending it out okay and then
I'm just going to start blending this in
using some fingers just bought it from a
store there are these super limited
edition chunky fingers and this will
give you like a beautiful radiant glow
that will shine through throughout the
day for foundation today I'm going to go
in with a mixture I'm gonna mix my
beloved old-school Kogan Joe 213 aqua
foundation this foundation used to be my
jam back in the day and I'm bringing it
back because it is flawless but I do
want to make it a little bit more pale
so I'm going to go in with the Urban
Decay all nighter foundation in point 5
and I'm applying this using a morphe g36
brush
well damn and I went a little paler if
that was even possible with my
foundation today because Harley does
rock a very pill based which I love
she's representing this oh you know just
a light layer of sheer foundation to
make you look like a natural beauty for
my under eyes and first gonna go in with
the Urban Decay Naked skin color
correcting fluid in pink and I'll be
using this to highlight mainly the inner
corners of my eyeballs and going with a
beauty blender to blend that in tap tap
and done and now with Urban Decay's
naked skin concealer and fair neutral
and just going to highlight and conceal
my features and you know the drill by
now and setting my under eye area with a
loose powder to prevent it from creasing
now with my beloved morphe m 444 and my
alumina silk powder by Giorgio Armani
I'm just going to set the risk of my
face you really want to make sure you
use tapping motions when applying powder
so many times I see people with a lot of
redness in their skin buff their powder
in and what that will do is kind of
erupt the base and mess up the base that
you work so hard on and brings back the
flaws and the redness so if you find
yourself bringing back some of the flaws
after applying your powder try patting
that powder in as opposed to buffing the
powder in and with my morphe 31 I just
like to set like larger areas of my face
or just pretty much everything and to
brush away my baked and highlight my
under eye area I'll be going in with
Mac's Shivering white powder and mixing
it with emphasize to make it a little
tiny bit less harsh just like that all
right now let's focus on these eyes I
just wanted this look to give that
Harlequin going on a night out look
super glam super beautiful but still
with her signature like smeared out
smokey eyes to show these bitches that
she is the crazy boss up in here but
still very glam so the first thing I'm
going to do is to prime my eyelids using
my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot to help
blending these colorful shadows I'm
going to set my crease to brow bone area
using a matte shade and I'll be using
Ivy from my Too Faced power of makeup
palette because for me it's the perfect
color to do that with
all right so on the right side of my
face I'll be applying the red makeup and
on the left side of my face that'd be
blue so let's start off with the red I'm
going to go in with a love plus eyes
shadow by sugarpill
this is a beautiful true pigmented but
read read I'm going to be applying this
all over my lid up to the crease and
applying the shade using a zueva 2 3 4
brush and with pigmented channels like
this you want to go very easy very
slowly because if you go in with too
much eye shadow at once it will just
kind of go everywhere and you will have
fallout everywhere and it's just one big
nightmare
I suggest grabbing a little bits of
eyeshadow and really building it up to
people just clean this possible I'm
going to switch over to a morphe m5 13
brush to blend the red into my creases
and up a little bit of that eye shadow a
little bit and touch off the excess and
with this we're slowly but surely going
to blend it up and I want this super
light diffused smoky halo eye effect so
you want the color to be most
concentrated on the lid but then once
you reach that crease that has to like
blow up like a dream so take it slowly
use short circular motions and go so
lightly up into that crease and blow it
up baby okay same brush same eyeshadow
we're going to drag that shadow down to
the lower lash line here and then we're
going to do the signature smeared out
look come back on to the lower lash line
here
and boo and baby and now with that same
rush same shadow just a tiny teeny bit
of it we're gonna do the smeared out
look so you just want to place the
blending brush flat onto your skin
you're gonna drizzle it out all right so
now you kind of have the gist of what
Harlequin would apply your eye shadow
like this is like a true Harlequin shape
but now we're going to make it a tad bit
more glam by adding some steps into this
look what I'm going to do is pick up a
black eye shadow and kind of darken the
outer corner here to bring in some depth
I'll be using the morphe 35c pallet one
of my favorites and with a more feet 17
I'm just going to smudge some black
close to the lash line you know I almost
want this look to be as if Harley Quinn
was watching some makeup tutorials on
YouTube and trying to like up her look a
little bit that's what I'm going for
today all right so while Harley was
watching this makeup tutorial a beauty
guru taught her to apply a beautiful
shimmering eyeshadow to the inner
corners of her eyes so that is what
she's doing I'll be applying the engli
pure pigment in number 75 to my inner
corners
a tiny bit of definition on the lower
lashline using a more feet 13 ein and
some black shadow and lastly she's
finally experiencing the life of false
lashes so the lashes I'll be using today
are by Lily lashes and I'll be using the
style Hollywood and of course every glam
look needs some glitter so we going in
with the Midnight Cowboy
heavy metal glitter by urban decay and
this is going on the inner third of the
lid and that is essentially what I had
in mind for the eyes so really keeping
it in that original Harley Quinn smoky
eye shape but added with a junk load of
glam so I'm going to do the other eye
same way with blue tones now for the
blue portion I'm going to go in with the
35 vibha by morphe and taking this shade
right there same techniques apply as
with the red
and since we use gold glitter on the
red-eye I may apply silver glitter on
the blue-eyed alright moving on to
cheeks I am gonna contour a little bit
cuz we know why I'm gonna use my Kevin
of Kwan alight sculpting powder with my
morphe and five-thirty brush and I am
going to contour my nose very lightly
using the morphe 47 brush this is my new
favorite brush to contour my nose with
so quick and precise so I'm just going
to pick up a tiny bit of the powder tiny
bit and I'm just going to create two
lines and then with that same brush I'm
softly very softly blend that in and
then with a big powder brush and some
face powder I'm gonna tap over top to
soften it and make it less harsh now of
course if Harley watched any random
makeup tutorial out there she knew she
had to be a plain highlighter at this
point and I'll be using the artist
Couture diamond glow powder in cocoa
bling
all right every tiny bit of flesh I'm
going to go in with this really bright
pink blush right here buys you a called
peony and I'm going for this color to
kinda tie in that clownish sort of
effect as her love for the Joker
everybody you want to go for a beautiful
vibrant matte red so I'm going to go for
these you a lip cream in Fez bonbon
something okay locking it all in place
with some Urban Decay chill makeup
setting spray and now on the red side of
your face you want to apply the word
rotten right here and a little heart

Squad harley quinn inspired glam makeup
