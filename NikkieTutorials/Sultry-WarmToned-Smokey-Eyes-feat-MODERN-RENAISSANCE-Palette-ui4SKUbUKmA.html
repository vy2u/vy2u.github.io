with the beloved modern Renaissance
pala by Anasazi Beverly Hills when I got
this palette I'm gonna be honest I was
like that's a lot of red but then when I
finally started playing with it I am
loved I think the modern renaissance
spelled by anastasia beverly hills is
really really cool it has a bunch of
warm red tones and warm Browns but it's
so versatile II can do so many looks
with this so today I went for the super
glam red smokey eyes with the pink touch
and some glitter some humongous false
lashes and metallic lips because I'm all
about the metallic honestly cause all so
in this video I'll be using a lot of new
products some products I've never used
on camera before but if love before and
some products I've never tried so this
video is gonna be a wind of fresh air
with new products on camera so I cannot
wait to show you how I did this and if
you want to know how I did this then
keep watching all right so throughout
today video I'll be trying a lot of new
products and I'm so excited to share
with you my first impressions so the
first product I'm gonna go in with is by
benefit this right here is the total
moisture facial cream this is my first
time applying this on camera I've been
using this for about two weeks now a
real life and I'm really enjoying what
it's doing for my face before applying
makeup I would have really used it as a
moisturizer for my skin care but I do
think it moisturizes the skin perfectly
for makeup so I really like it for
makeup moisturizing for foundation today
I'm going to go in with this girl and
one this is called 10 new the perfection
which is a high friend I think that's
pretty close time proof foundation
ultimate lasting perfection I got the
color 2 which I feel like this will be a
little bit too turn out a little bit
this will be too dark for me so gonna
mix it with a lighter foundation
something very new for me the start here
isn't our teeth brush and we all
recognize our toothbrushes because they
look like little like Bobo's shower
heads and this right here is the fluenta
oval number 8 and I'm just going to pick
up some of the foundation on that brush
this you're just gonna foundation and
face up and I swear using the artiste
brushes for your foundation is one of
the fastest ways of doing your
foundation because you literally just
brush it on and the brush does all the
work for you and what I find so amazing
about these brushes is they really give
you the most coverage you could wish for
in your foundation other brushes are
like a Beauty Blender you get a lot of
coverage but sometimes you feel like the
brush or the product you're using to
apply your foundation with it kind of
takes away the pigmentation and coverage
that the foundation provides what this
it just keeps the ultimate amount of
coverage in the brush and you just smear
and apply it on and it does the work for
you it's it's amazing for concealer I'll
be trying to new ones today the first
one is gonna be by amazing cosmetics and
this right here is the amazing concealer
in ivory and then also the brand new
tart shape tape contour concealer in
fair and gonna mix it to first going in
with the amazing concealer on the inner
part of my under eyes that's white I
love that a grant that appreciates us
pasty goes out there and the tart
concealer right here on the tops of my
cheekbones and to blend it in I'll be
using my new morphe Beauty sponge I have
no idea what this is called it's a black
one and I'm I'm throwing it actually new
sponges other than the Beauty blenders
always kind of scare me because the
Beauty Blender is the only one that is
like so soft and blends concealer in
like perfection so any other sponge kind
of scares me because usually they're
harder and more rough and they kind of
take away foundation and leave like
patches and holes in your base but so
far this morphe one looks looks really
good okay moment of truth under-eye area
okay that is looking beautiful so far
DeBakey I'll be using my NARS powder in
snow and again I'm kind of afraid
because with beauty when you have like a
nice tip to go underneath your eyes with
this doesn't okay so not going to lie
really impressed with this it is harder
to go underneath the eyes with this so I
might not use it for powder but so far
it's it's really nice now with a loose
powder and my morphe 51 brush I'm going
to try the Alyssa Ashley technique she
picks up way too much powder douses it
all over the face then bust it in and
then wipes all the excessive powder away
okay so too much powder too much nuts
are buffing it in and that is how she
sets the face to blend in my under eye
area I'm going to go into the Mac
Shivering white powder and with this I'm
just going to brush away the Bakke and
highlight my under eye area
the first thing I'll be doing as always
is priming my eyes using this paint pop
by Mac called soft ochre with more fils
porcelain eyeshadow on the set my crease
to brow bone area to help lending later
on and doing so using a Mac 252 brush
let's dive into the Anasazi Beverly
Hills Modern Renaissance pillow I'm
going to go in with the colorbond fresco
first and with a morphe m5o 4 brush I'm
just gently applying that to the crease
as slow and steady start adding more
layers of bun fresco to create more
depth you can always go back in with
porcelain by morphe and that mac 242
brush and clean it the shape and the
blending if you've gone too far up or
you're just not feeling what are you
seeing this is kind of your eraser all
right now going into this beautiful
color right here called Venetian red and
with my favorite lower lashline brush
this one is by morphe I talked about
this in snapchat this is the M 508 this
is perfect to pack on color on the lower
lash line from the palette I went in
with red ochre and I'm using back here
on that outer corner to meet in that
crease and then with a little more feom
514 I'm just going to blend and buff
that in the outer corners
now going in with a small synthetic
angle brush and creating a new inner
corner on the lower lash line to cut the
lid I'm now going in with the mac
prolongwear concealer in NC 15 and this
is like cutting the crease but we
already put a crease in so by cutting
the lid you mimic a cut crease and to
cut the lid up using a sigma lip lo5
brush overtop i'll be applying for
mirror and of course you want to stay
inside that cut lit line on the center
of the little vo pine this is you a pink
pearl powder eye shadow and on the inner
third of the lid I'll be applying this
Stila metallic rose quartz
quickly highlighting my inner corners
using porcelain by morphe again alright
and on the waterline vista for a
colorful shadow and liner in white
alright all that is left to do now is
apply some beautiful gorgeous lashes
these are my new bouncing called Bella
and they're my new obsession they are so
full so fluffy so amazing yes
so we've just modern renaissance our
eyes it's time to modern renaissance are
cheekbones the first thing I'm gonna do
is contour this is already on my face
cuz I didn't realize I wasn't filming
yet I'm using break up by makeup geek on
a morphe M 530 brush and I'm just gonna
mimic what I was doing
okay so what I did was I just swooped
break up right here in the hollows of my
cheek da da da da da da da da cut and
then with my zoeva 142 up a little bit
more of break up contour powder by
makeup geek and i focus on the base
right here and then if you do that if
you focus on that base there and then go
in with a face powder and clean up
underneath at the edges and even on top
of the contour itself you have so laid
your contour I just told everyone that
but I wasn't recording alright and then
from blush I already put a little bit on
I'm using the new makeup geek blush in
hard robe I love this color so much it
just matches these eyes perfectly so I'm
also going to warm up my face a little
bit more with the blush by blushing at
my forehead yes people it's a thing and
a little bit on the chin area to
highlight today I'm going to go in with
the Pat McGrath Tyler this is the pinky
of the two this is the peplum graff
lab's
iridescent pink 0:03 pigment highlighter
now I know this isn't really gonna boom
everyone's eyes so I'm going to use this
as a base highlight and then lighten it
up after
see how that has a really nice pink
reflective it's for my personal taste
it's not blinding enough but like if
you're like into like not blinding
people with their highlight then this is
perfect for you whoo you guys I'm going
to say something I'm not as in love with
these as I hoped I would all right with
my sleek solstice palette and pick up
the lightest shade and just bling up
that highlight a tiny bit more now
that's the shine I'm looking for then
let's not forget about the and that's it
for the cheeks nice and blinding all
right for lips our first going in with
the Too Faced melted matte liquid
lipstick in OnPoint
and then over top for a metallic shine
I'm going to go in with the violet of Oz
shade liquid lipstick shirred going in
with the Milani materialistic metallic
liquid lip cuz I need a more alright all
we need now is some setting spray and
today I'm going to change it up a little
I'm going to go for chill by Urban Decay
