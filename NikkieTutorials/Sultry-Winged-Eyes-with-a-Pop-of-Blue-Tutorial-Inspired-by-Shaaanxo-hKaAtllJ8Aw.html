with Shan EXO here on YouTube and I'm
absolutely honored and thrilled to be
doing this today because I've talked
about Shannon a couple of times before
how much I loved her videos how much
inspiration she gives me and uh it's
just an honor so you'll be collaborating
with her today so for our collab we
thought it would be fun to do one look
from one another so Shannon took
inspiration from my Khloe Kardashian at
the Oscars makeup tutorial and she did
her collab video on that and I took
inspiration from Shannon's get ready
with me Lord
VIP concert video I'm a big sucker for
any video that Shannon puts out because
I love how she always puts that glamour
in her looks so yeah if you want to know
how to get this look then please keep on
watching and if you want to know how to
get Shannon's look inspired by my Khloe
Kardashian Oscars video then go check
out all her links in the info box below
and of course you can click on the
picture so um yeah without any further
ado let's go so I already went ahead and
prime my eyelids and I use my neck soft
ochre Paint Pot for this I know that
Shannon used a different Paint Pot but I
just the soft ochre is my child
the first eyeshadow we'll be using is by
makeup geek and this is called creme
brulee and with that I'm going to start
defining my crease this will also act as
a transition color later on and then
with a bigger blending brush I'm just
going to diffuse the edges and blend
even further up you really want this to
blend into nothingness
for the livin gonna take a little bit of
a little racks unzipped palette unspoken
and as I said this will be my lid color
and then of course you want to blend
this in to each other perfectly as well
so I'm taking a bigger blending brush
and I'm blending the darker Brown into
the lighter brown and I'm going to take
this Lancome eye pencil and this is
called number 10 deep water blue and
I'll be running that on my waterline and
then also blending down on
the actual lower lashline and then with
a brush I'm going to buff that in then
I'm slightly going to take it on to the
outer part here and blend it on to the
outer corners now I'm going to create a
mixture between Mac's contrast eyeshadow
and makeup gigs of Duchess and I'll be
using this combo to set the pencil and
to smoke it out even more this will also
get the blue a little bit more of an
intense smoky vampy look instead of the
bright bright blue and because I like
that to be a little bit more bright I'm
going to take makeup geeks Neptune and
go over top now to give the list a
little bit more shine and possess I'm
going to take this the bomb over shadow
pigments in if you're rich I'm single
and I'm just gonna take a little bit
with my finger and dust that over my lid
and I'm going to highlight my inner
corner using lorac unzipped palette
under cover and a little bit of makeup
geeks ice queen and what I'm now going
to do is apply a thick bold a luscious
winged eyeliner using my Catrice a
liquid eyeliner in waterproof
to finish that I look up we're going to
need some mascara and lashes and for
mascara I am using my makeup studio what
a brute 3d extra black and four lashes
you know it by now it's my favorite the
Mac 36 so far the cheeks I already
contoured using my illamasqua eyeshadow
in heroine and Shannon had a beautiful
bronze going on so I'm going to try to
mimic that and for that I will use my
illamasqua blush in disobey and I'm just
going to take a big buffer brush and
just add some warmth to my entire
complexion because extreme dark smoky
looks like this can really drain color
from your face I'm going to punch some
color back in using my Kiko rock
attraction blush in number two guitar
rose and then to give my complexion a
beautiful glow Ally's dis Kiko blush
rock attraction blush again in number
one pearly rock for the lips Shannon
kept everything really nude and glossy
so I'm first going to line my lips
making them look a little bit fuller
using my Lancome lip liner in number 211
beige rose
then for my lipstick i'll be using mac's
pure zen and then for a little bit of
gloss I'm going to use Mac's lip glass
and talk softly to me
and that guy's concludes my part of the
