tutorial inspired by the summer sunset I
I've always wanted to do a look inspired
by the sunset I kind of wanted to go a
little cuckoo with my makeup today
because I wanted these cat smokey
extreme eyes a little bit dragged a
little bit extreme okay a whole lot
extreme but I was just in the mood for
something extreme and out there and
color all inspired by a summer sunset so
if you're interested in learning how to
get these summer sunset cat smokey eyes
then please keep on watching the first
thing I want to do for this look is of
course prime / moisturize and what it is
a new product for me this is the Mac
complete comfort cream I bought this
yesterday I actually can't wait to try
this out because I heard nothing but
great things about this some super
stoked so apparently this is one of the
best moisturizer / primers for the face
to get it really moist and just just
really even and just soft and just
perfect for makeup application looks
like that it smells just as amazing as
all the other fix+ sort of products I'm
just gonna very soft I'm just gonna you
know put this into my face it feels very
very soft feels pretty good it's a lot
thicker than my natural radiance in
radiant yellow it still feels very
nourished and very good for makeup
application later on okay now let's go
on to foundation today I'm going to go
for my face and body by Mac in c1 and to
give that a little bit more coverage
here and there I'm going to slap on a
little bit of the Bobbi Brown Skin
Foundation stick in zero parcel in first
I'm going to apply the face and body and
really buffing that in with my makeup
geek Foundation stippling brush
and I've talked about using this
combination before and I think it just
gives you the most perfect natural
perfect coverage because it covers
everything but it's not too much so this
is my face of body on and then wherever
I needed I'm going to apply a little bit
of the skin foundation stick I'm just
buffing that in with the same brush but
then using more stippling motions
instead of really buffing it in now so
for concealer and for that I'm using my
Mac Pro Longwear in NC 15 and then as
always with my Sigma f80 6 I'm buffing
that it
yes okay I'm just quickly going to set
that with my Janelle natural loose
finish powder do my brows and one eye
off-camera and then I'll be back I will
be back the first thing I did was
applying a base to my eyelid to prevent
ashes from creasing and to make the
colors pop a lot more and I use my Mac
soft ochre Paint Pot for that so now I'm
going to take this makeup geek eyeshadow
in yellow brick road I'm going to start
by applying this color to the very inner
third of my lid going up to the crease
not taking a bit of sugar pills butter
cupcake I'm applying that over top to
intensify the color and why I applied
yellowbrickroad first is because I find
butter cupcake to not really stand well
on its own but paired with this shimmery
yellowbrickroad color it's perfect
now going in sugar pills flame point and
you guessed it that is going into the
middle also going up to the crease and
to blend it with the yellow you kind of
want to place your brush on that sort of
line where they meet and kind of go back
and forth like this and they blend
really easily so you hardly have to do
any work for it next sugar pill color
this is dolly pop and that is going on
the outer third meeting up with the
orange I was the sorry but another sugar
pill color this is poison plum and with
poison plum and kind of going to make my
shape by creating an outer V so making a
little line here and from there going
into my crease and they also want to
start blending that with the pink then
for my transition color I went into my
softbox a to a pellet and took this
color right here and mix it with makeup
geeks chickadee and those two colors are
going to go right above the other colors
we placed into the crease to kind of
settle it a bit more I'm going to start
buffing the crease out
even more so here on that outer part on
that outer half and slightly but really
you want to flick it out
and then bring it back in I'm going to
take a matte black eyeshadow and what
I'm going to do is first trace my lower
lash line with that and then with a
little bit of the purple connecting it
to the outer part here and then you want
to look down and create this new inner
corner like that I know it looks really
strange right now but it will tie in
together at the end and now you want to
diffuse colors underneath that so I'm
going in with my purple and putting it
on the outer part here and blending up
and now going in with a little bit of
orange and continuing that just make it
really smoky guys now with a blending
brush and a little bit of that pink I'm
going to pull this pink out and up to
really give it that cat shape okay and
now it's time to do the eyeliner work
you want to make this sort of Indian
Bollywood inner corner point and then
just make a really thick cat winged
eyeliner and um just follow along so
first going to put that inner corner in
using my super liner by L'Oreal and you
just want to do so by pulling out that
inner corner then tilting your head back
and making that line now for eyeliner
I'll be using the Catrice liquid liner
in dating Jo black and just go liner
crazy with this
and then as a finishing touch I'm going
to take a white liquid liner and draw a
little tiny mini line between those two
new inner corners we created okay now
it's time to do all the lash work for
mascara I'll be using my makeup studio
water pour 3d in extra black for my
lower lashes I'll be using my Mac
extended play gigablack lash and for
salty I'll be using the EXO Beauty
glamorous Tess what's an extreme look
like this
I think sculpting the face makes it that
much more interesting and perfect and
just unique and amazing and oh my god
you need two contouring in your life so
for contouring today I'll be using the
Ben Nye contour shade number one blush
then almost gonna bronze up my face
because with such a sultry look you need
some warmth in there um you know what
I'm using I'm not even gonna bother it's
hella Baska so for blush I'm gonna go
with a new favorite this is the
hourglass um
lighting blush in dim infusion I am
loving this maybe and placing that
somewhat higher up on my cheekbones more
on the back you want everything to be
lifted with this look the eyes are
totally lifted now you want the cheeks
to be lifted as well and of course on my
channel a look wouldn't be completed
with a little bit of glow I'm gonna go
first with the double cindy lou manizer
and this is just a little bit more
peachy and pinky and more opal shaded
and I definitely love that with this
entire look so I'm going to take a
little bit with my fan brush and just
highlight with that first and it blends
beautifully as sort of a blush
highlighter so this also will give you
that amazing glow from within look can
you see that shine right there it's not
overpowering but it's definitely they're
making it really glowy from within and
then for my nose and Cupid's bow I'm
going to go with a soft and gentle by
Mac
okay for lips because the eyes are so
pulled up and intense I want to go a
little bit easier on the lips today I
first gonna line and give them a little
bit more fullness using my Bobbi Brown
pill pink lip pencil for lipstick I'm
gonna tap on a little bit of Mac's myth
just a really neutral out the natural
color of my lips and then on top I want
to go with color your smell lip gloss in
coral craze and that guys concludes my
summer sunset smokey cat eyes and makeup
