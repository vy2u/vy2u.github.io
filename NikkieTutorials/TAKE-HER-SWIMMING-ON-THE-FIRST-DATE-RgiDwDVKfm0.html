video to me cuz today my channel hit 3
million suprise
oh my flippin god I cannot even believe
this this one so fast and it's it's it's
blowing my mind so from the bottom of my
heart I really want to thank each and
every one of you for supporting me
showing me all this love and support and
just amazingness and thank you and I
love you so I've been doing YouTube for
around seven to eight years now I've
been here for a long long long long long
long time and in these seven years I've
seen a lot of comments come and go and
one that really stood out to me lately
is that's where I take her swimming on
the first date I've been doing a lot of
traveling I've been going to the states
to LA New York and when you're on a
plane a lot and you make a lot of hours
your mind starts to wonder cuz I mean
how much is there really for you to do
on a plane trust me when you have three
long-haul flights in one month you've
seen all the movies you know what food
is coming and pretty much there isn't
anything renewing anymore
oh and I play this game I'm oh my god I
have to show you guys this game I've
been playing this right here is best
fiends I'm obsessed with this game and
basically you have to watch you have to
go like that and then kill this mean guy
right here he's an asshole
so he's the bad guy and then you have a
team of five little cutesy beasts and
that is your team and you can make him
grow and evolve and just make them
stronger to kill this backer it's it's
so addictive you guys look see if I
connect all the flowers it's going to
kick the bad guy
BAM I'll put a link down below on where
you can get this game trust you'll
become a junkie but what I'm not playing
a game we're not watching a movie you
know your mind starts to wonder and I go
wow if this plane crashes can I swim
because you're so tired from the flight
you start thinking about all the stuff
that's connected to in here like if I
swim will my makeup last I'll be dead
but will my makeup last you know and
then you start thinking about like
waterproof makeup and how like girls who
do synchronized swimming keep them
synchronized swimmers how the hell do
they keep their makeup on it's like true
magic to me so today in order to
celebrate three million I thought why
not try the best waterproof makeup
tutorial ever by recreating a
synchronized swimmer makeup and
synchronized swimmer makeup will really
take your makeup to the next level you
know they they don't really care about
blending they don't really care they
just want to make a statement and then
with the backseats the back rows back
there they want their makeup to be lit
for the back row they just want to make
a shock and I love the philosophy that's
all about me as well I'm like I'm like
makeup has to be shopping I love that
philosophy so today in order to take my
makeup to the next level for 3 million
oh my god I thought why not do a
synchronized swimmer inspired makeup
tutorial or two the first I'm going to
do a foundation no one will see in the
water but it's for ourselves so we're
kind of gonna go quickly through skin
because you know we're pretty much in
the water a lot of people will see it
but it's for and ever you don't apply
too much you want to keep a light and
soft like I just did you know just buff
it in with the brush work return okay so
we've got that on here's where the true
fun begins we're gonna play up our eyes
and remember you want to make an impact
for those back rows okay so for the live
we're going to start off with a
beautiful soft blue just to show these
bitches
the water who's boss and remember back
rows so when you're in the back row of a
swimming pool your eyes tend to look a
little bit smaller so instead of
following your natural crease right
above it lid for the front row back row
okay now I really want to cut the crease
using a defining purple and remember
make an impact so from the inner crease
cut the Cruze and sweep up yes okay now
with a white we're going to increase the
size of our eyes just to keep it light
you know for like grocery shopping in
the pool mm-hmm you want to make sure
that both sides are so even cuz your
eyes will look wonky don't want that and
with a pink I'm gonna trace underneath
the white mm-hmm procession okay so
because we want to win the gold medal
some gold juice perked up those brows
babe and now it's time to start adding
all the definition using black so we're
going to do brows lashes now because
lashes won't last long in the water you
paint them on
okay of course you need a fierce winged
wings make me happy
no of the more of this art I see the
more I think you know take me swimming
on the first date I'll show you my
makeup skills bitch so we're going to
contour and normally I would blend it
out nicely but you want to make an
impact natural beauty is the key to
citizen like have you seen my beauty I
fuck with your natural beauty
synchronized swimmers always wear these
like clamps on their noses to keep the
water from coming into their noses so in
order to get that pinched and perfected
effect you draw new nostrils up to the
tip of your nose to make it look like
it's perfect and for lips you want to go
red the color of the pool after you slay
your enemies okay so after a couple of
final touch-ups your makeup is done you
are ready for this date you have taken
that level of synchronized swimmer
realness and we got this we got this
take me swimming baby take me swimming
and now of course I'm going to show you
that once you're going on this date and
you are wearing this amazing makeup it
will last
hey guys so today I'm doing a tutorial
on this makeup look right here I have no
idea what I'm going to call it yet but
it's a fun one because I'll be using a
lot more affordable products than I
normally would</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
