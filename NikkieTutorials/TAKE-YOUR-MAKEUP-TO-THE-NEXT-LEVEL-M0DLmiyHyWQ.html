take your makeup to the next level
cuz no matter what you do you feel like
your makeup skills suck and you need to
improve them I'm here to help you you're
at the right place you're good to go
let's go tend to go in with Foundation
and the thing with foundation is don't
go natural nobody wants natural we all
want to make our faces look like plastic
so I'm just gonna take a little bit of
foundation like so like so and then just
evenly apply to the face just a little
bit more for a little bit of extra
coverage you want to tap your face and
take notes the closer you get to your
eyes are do you want to slap it the
biggest Instagram trend as of late is
contouring and highlighting so today
I'll be showing you how to do it like a
pro first grab yourself a cool tone
brown shade to carve out your shadows
yes I sometimes tend to forget where I
need to place everything so I like to
write it down yes I forget that too so I
like to write it down
and of course highlighter yes now
continue this I'll throw at your face
and make sure you get your best features
let's totes mcgoats not forget about our
nose contour I want to go thin and sexy
and the most important step is to create
a little rounded dot just on the tip
make it look like a penis all you want
to do now is blend this in softly I feel
like we need more blush there we go to
set my highlighter I'm now taking some
loose powder and cooking this to make it
look extra flawless and natural you want
to set this awesome contour using a
contouring powder that is not too orange
awesome you're doing great now it's time
for the next big trend eyebrows you want
em to be full bushy and super natural
so I'm gonna start out by defining my
first couple of hairs to get that hair
like feel beautiful and just continue on
defining that lovely luscious brow
watchout Cara Delevingne I'm coming for
you and you want to try and make your
brows look as symmetrical as possible
now it's time for the eyes and the
biggest trend for the eye department is
eyeliner so grab your liquid liner and
create the most beautiful flick of your
life beautiful let me zoom you in a
little and on the action from there you
want to bring it back towards your inner
corner now in my inner corner fill in
the blank spots make sure you look up
when it's drying and I just feel like we
need to even it out a little bit more
just a tepid higher now for the lower
lashline you want to create a new inner
corner to make your eyes look bigger
make sure it's really soft and natural
look how big my eyes look and to really
open up the eyes I'm taking a white
liquid liner and just filling in the
blank spots perfect now go on to the
other eye and again just as your
eyebrows make sure they're symmetrical
therefore the last
end of this video and to take your
makeup skills to the next level kylie
jenner lips so first I'm just starting
off with a very neutral skin tone brown
color to just define and give myself a
little bit more volume the key is to
just heighten your Cupid's bow just to
keep this Bell alone and that will
naturally make it look like you have
plump lips oh yes
only go out on the top of your lip not
on the sides because if you go out on
the sides of your mouth it makes it look
like a clown mouth now I don't have the
money to afford any sore lip pencil by
Mac so I'm just going in with a nude
color now my lips have never looked
better to complete this look all you
want to do now is apply some falsies and
I'm just going for let me grab my
natural ones if our lashes were actually
going to place the lash upside down and
this will give a very fun unexpected
natural twist living and that guys is
how you take your makeup to the next
level bye bye oh goodness oh God alright</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
