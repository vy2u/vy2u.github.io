latest hottest tools to apply your
foundation with you know lately we've
truly seen it all we've seen condoms
we've seen tampons we've seen balloon
we've truly seen it all like everything
like everything but in today's video
I'll be showing you the four latest
hottest trends to take your foundation
application to the next level really
elevate your skills as I would say so I
already gone ahead and did my brows and
do my eye makeup so let's get
crack-a-lackin' and let's show you the
first hottest product to apply your
foundation with you know sometimes when
you are looking for the next best thing
you can look far you can look for miles
you can look for ages you can look
forever but sometimes the answer is
closer than you think
sometimes that answer is in your fridge
that answer today is guess which a
pepper now little known fact about me I
love peppers I love them a snack and not
only do they bless my heart as a snack
they're also the perfect foundation
applicator why why why why when you look
at the pepper surface it is smooth it's
got little ridges every now and then
that gives it a nice skin like texture
it is an absorb product it is luscious
and it just it works alright so let me
grab a little bit of foundation and I
definitely suggest using the pepper on a
larger areas of your face I would never
really recommend it underneath your eyes
we'll come to that later but the pepper
is great for bigger surfaces so what's
going to do is dip it into the
foundation
I know people out there may be skeptical
but you will be a true believer after
this once you see what happens you're a
believer trust me so it's best to start
smudging in the foundation using the
pepper smudge it in okay and then when
you feel comfortable enough start
tapping it in
and as you can see that leaves you with
a traceless beautiful finish so that is
trick number one if you have a pepper
lying around
why wasted don't eat it use it for your
face next up kids toys must be a section
of the sir that you usually ignore if
you don't have children and if you're
past the age of 27 but sometimes kids
toys have hidden secrets so here we got
cute little jig digit with the surname
so here we got the wife sassy dogs
around the secret lies the practice what
what is this movie called the secret
life of Pat I think her name is digit or
did you digit and now again you might be
a negative Nancy at home watching this
video being all judgmental and but
listen to me when you look at this
girl's tail you see that it has a nice
round touch to it
again her tails got a little bit of
texture to it so just like the easy
blender it will give you that skin like
texture and Bom Bom all right so doing
the same picking up some foundation
using Mama's tail so just like that and
here we go again
first I like to smooth in the foundation
take your time and it might look a
little patchy in the beginning but trust
me when you start blending and patting
it in a beautiful coverage okay now will
be the time to start tapping and as you
can see I am left with total and utter
flawlessness
and now I told you you might be
skeptical in the beginning but once you
see these results you will look for
items anywhere in your house hope that
it will go viral in you your famous
alright last one at least for the
foundation part let's cover our forehead
eye again kids section it's where the
magic happens play-doh and not just any
type of play-doh but for rosin play-doh
Olaf play-doh so in this box of magic I
found multiple colors of play-doh in my
or glitter
because you're extra and you need that
type of extra notes in your life glitter
play-doh and of course you can go the
easy route and grab your play-doh
transform it into a Beautyblender shape
but how amazing would it be if you had
your play-doh in a Beautyblender shape
but with something to grab on to maybe
oh love head so let's get all very do it
yourself at home let's grab the play-doh
oh my god it looks like snow so what
we're going to do is Moulton I sip for
foundation then once you have your ball
you're going to grab Olaf and stick them
right in there all right so now we've
got the ole blender I'm so good at this
we're going to grab the hola blender dip
it into your foundation and slay and the
perfect thing about the play-doh is that
it doesn't observe any product okay you
the soul all right now you might be
asking me okay girl but what do you use
for concealer for concealer we're going
to use one of the latest trends I feel
like everyone has one laying around in
their house a pop socket this one just
happens to be in the Illuminati ones
that has nothing to do with me nothing
you know all those things that chained
awesome better watch out for concealer
of course going to use my shape tape and
then we're going to blend it in using a
pop socket again the smooth surface it's
smaller it's just it's what you need
when you want to take your makeup and
especially your foundation and concealer
application to the next level
hmm
all right now all that is left to do for
me is finish off doing my eyes and blush
and lips and then it will be back and
that guys is how you can take your
foundation and seal our application to
the next level on April Fool's for a
fullness of every single product
