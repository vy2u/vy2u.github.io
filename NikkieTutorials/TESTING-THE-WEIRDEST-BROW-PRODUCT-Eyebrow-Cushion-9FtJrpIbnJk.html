fun first impressions video on a product
that I've been seeing going around and
I'm so excited for it
unless you have lived under a rock you
know that foundation cushions have been
quite the rage mmm mainly last year a
little bit into this year I feel like
we've slowly stepped away from it but
now hmm iconic London has come out with
brow cushions
barão cushions you say yes brow
cushions so when you think of a
foundation cushion you think of
foundation in a sponge in a compact you
press your tool into it and you apply to
your face and you're done this is the
exact same for the brow product so
iconic London came out with a two-tone
set in three colors so right here it's
got the compact when you open it it
comes with a little brush right here and
then let me show you the two tonus of it
all look this is a cushion a cushion for
the pushin and basically what iconic is
promising with this is that you get the
most realistic hair strokes with this
product because you can push a brush in
really hard for a dramatic effect or
really lightly for really light effect
like any product let me see what the
internet says you can get the most
written yet we talked about that it is
fast drying so it doesn't smudge plus
it's long wearing it lasts up to 24 24
don't wearing makeup for 24 it is
water-resistant vegan and cruelty free
it includes vitamin E to help stimulate
hair growth for an added boost and for
the ultra thin angled brush it has been
specifically designed for the formula to
make them the perfect pair so in today's
video I'm gonna put it to the test I'm
gonna take a fun ride with it because if
you know me if you've been on my channel
before you know that brows are so
everything to me you mess with my brows
you mess with me you touch my brows you
touch me you talk nasty back my brows to
talk to nasty about me I take my brows
very very seriously it's so for a
product you have such high promises I
can't wait to smoothing this onto my
brows and see how it works all right so
welcome to my
it is a lot to handle but it's here to
stay so for the brows i'm gonna be using
the medium kit because oh my god I
spilled some on my wrist when swatching
and it's impossible to get off which is
a good thing but also not because so for
today's demonstration try out first
impressions first looks I'm gonna be
trying out the medium kit because I like
my brows a little bit darker that's just
the way I like it
you can like yours with male q can like
yours with sugar I like him with a
little dark okay so in the little kit
comes this brush right here and like the
description said it goes perfectly with
the kit is specifically designed to go
with the kit so let's find out okay Bear
Rao here we go first I'm going to brush
all the hairs down because I like to
start at the top and I'm going to dip it
into the darker of the two and I like a
dramatic brows I'm gonna dip quite
fiercely into that cushion
holy that is so precise work it to the
front oh my god it's actually really
easy to use so far it's got amazing
pigment but what I'm most surprised
about is how precise and sharp it is
okay dipped in again slightly to build
it up here oh my god oh this is gonna be
a good day out here for the tail ah you
know what this is gonna be amazing for
okay if you've watched my video with
Patrick you know that I do the hair
strokes at the beginning like hair hair
hair
this is gonna be heaven for that like
pure magic heaven so I've got the top
filled out and that was actually really
quick and easy look how sharp that is we
don't need any concealer with that it
dipping into the dark color again and I
find that you only need a tiny bit a
little bit goes a very long way
what what on planet earth I'm just
following the shape of my brow connect
up the tail dipping in again to bring it
to the front no stress I've got no
issues this is going amazing so now
we've got the top and the bottom filled
in plus the till is now actually a tail
and now no longer non-existent so now
I'm going to fill in using a mixture of
both the dark color on the outer edge
and the lighter color more towards the
front okay it is a little bit dark I'm
not gonna lie it's a little darker than
I expected so for the next brown I'm
gonna do with this I'm gonna go for the
lighter shade because now that the
entire brow is filled in it's leaning a
little dark but again I I don't mind I
like a dark brow I don't like it with
milk or sugar just dark so now that we
have the entire shape filled in and
we've got things going for us it's time
for my favorite part the hairs but I am
gonna change brushes for this because I
feel like although this brush is really
sharp and precise I wanted it to be
sharper and more precise than that time
for Valentina oh yes in love babe I'm
breaking up with you I'm marrying this
product we're done guys usually I use
okay I start off with pencil then I go
in with two brow pomade then I go in
with the gel then I'm going with the
concealer I use five brow products to
achieve this to achieve this I am now
gonna conceal a little bit to sharpen up
right here the concealer I like using
for this is my Mac this is select cover
up in nw15 and my Claire's brush because
Claire's brush is the best freshness
I'm not gonna do the other brow
off-camera and do a very fun I look off
camera because oh hello you caught me
MIT glance so I finished up doing my eye
makeup and I am mid baked but I just I
felt lonely and I want you to join me
and of course I'm tuning you in into my
favorite part highlighter it doesn't get
any better than highlighter and also
brows completed again they are dark but
look how crisp and clean and so I'm
gonna be highlighting using glazed donut
my collaboration with Oprah cosmetics
it's this one has come a long way I use
this daily when I'm not wearing makeup I
still wear it as like a glow because
what I love about this one it's
buildable so you can do very very sheer
or you can send signals to Mars
her lips are gonna go with the makeup
forever liquid lipstick in the colour
101
and then for a class I'm gonna use these
you a lipgloss in the color divine and
finishing with some setting spray all
right and now that my entire face is
done this is what the brows look like
and like I said I love it so much I love
it love it love it the claims of it
being very precise and the most hair
like finish you can wish for I actually
agree with this definitely looks more
like actual hair strokes than when doing
with a powder or a brow pomade I feel
like a brow pomade is a little bit too
much a brow powders a little bit too
little and this is like the perfect
in-between product to give you that hair
stroke finish I think I really like this
you can push it in hard to get the most
and you can push it in lightly to get a
little list I think the product is
awesome
I think the brush I like I like the
sharpness I like the angle of it the
only thing I don't like is that it is
this type of brush I'd rather buy a
separate brush that has this brush top
here that has a long handle to really
place it in your hand nicely right now
it's a little bit too short for my
liking and the I mean who doesn't have
like a spare spoolie laying around
somewhere so I feel like if they come
out with a separate brush that is this
brush but long on a long handle that
would be amazing and I would be the
first to buy it it retails for 33 euros
which I've questioned hold on
holds on Siri how many dollars is 33
euros did you add a new voice so overall
usually they go down I think this is
around $35 you get two colours for that
two brow colours for that the brush the
packaging which has a mirror for if
you're on the go I think it's worth it
again with every review I do money it's
totally up to you I cannot say if
something is worth it for you because if
you think $35 is a lot of money for a
makeup product then it's a lot of money
for me
I can't be the one saying well go get it
because you know it's $35 it's totally
up to you it's such a personal
preference I personally think it is so
so worth it and do with it what you want
other than that I am sold on this
