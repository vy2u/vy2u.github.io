a playtime video using a brand new
morphe eyeshadow palette they came out
with the 3502 second-nature palette and
as you can see warm tone alert this
palette right here has a 35 very warm
brown copper red shimmery champagne
shades in there and basically feel like
warm tones this is your holy grill so
today I'm gonna be taking the palette
out for a spin I created this look right
here with it
it is glam it is fall a s it is so
intense so warm but so sultry and sexy
at the same time I'm like really feeling
my look right now basically we're gonna
bust out the warm tones introduce
ourselves
introduce our faces to fall I'm so
excited it's seven o'clock in the
morning and my brain is fried let's
let's fry it some more with powder and
glitter and so much more let's enjoy
this look and bye
alrighty so the first color I'm going to
go in with is tan so I start by packing
it on the outer corner here and I really
start building up definition for this
eye I want it to be super sexy and
smoked out and very delish so it's all
about the blending for this so pop that
color on first and we'll focus on
blending after with a clean 2 to 7 brush
by zueva and I'm gonna buff out and
smooth out the edges
now going in with one of the most iconic
shades of this palette fire and applying
fire to the outer third kind of meeting
up with that Brown and smoking it into
the lid area going in with the color
rustic this is a stunning very pigmented
copper shimmery shade and this is going
on the lid blending into fire you really
want to bring in that rustic shade do
you want that rustic shade to blend into
fire like it's saying I own 51% of this
eyelid on a Lux II 237 brush I'm not
gonna buff out those edges because it's
looking a little sharp okay then outer
corner is looking a little bit weak so
let's intensify it using chestnut just
packing it on blending it out packing it
on blending it out grabbing a Smashbox
full coverage shadow brush and going
back in with chestnut and defining the
lower lash line and making it smoky baby
stain brush going in with 10 and for a
little bit of glam going in with pure on
the inner third of the lower lash line
and you know somehow I just want more so
I'm going in with the black of the
pallet this one is called Wiz darkening
that outer corner up more now let me
tell you this black is very intense so
go little by little because go little by
little trust me
going in with one of my absolute
all-time favorite holy girl highlighter
shadows this is festive gold by Melchior
cosmetics and this is going on my inner
corners and this is going to transform
everything alright some intoxicating
lashes by flutter lashes and this look
for the eyes have done
hi so as I'm working on my face here um
here are some overall thoughts about the
palette number one it's so pigmented
it's crazy like this palette legit feels
different than all the other morphe
palettes it reminds me quality wise a
lot of the jaclyn hill palette which
makes sense because jacqueline did
curate some of the colors in this
palette jacqueline helped morphe create
this palette it's it's not a
collaboration but she helped pick colors
and help pick formulas and she nailed it
again she nailed it with her own palette
and this palette again I'm loving this
entire morphe rebranding situation
because the brand is starting to look a
little bit more luxe it's starting to
feel more luxurious the quality is
getting higher and higher while the
quality for its price already was pretty
crazy but now they feel creamier they
feel smoother they have even more
pigment and I'm living for blush and
going in with the Ofra blush in might hi
and if you follow me on snapchat which
I'm now verified on snapchat I have my
own little emoji Jim's Charles says the
emoji as well so let's see who is the
true glow criminal kidding I'm totally
kidding but I do have two sparkly glow
emoji right next to my snapchat name
which is naked tutorials and I don't
know it it feels pretty cool and I'm
just really thankful that so many of you
actually follow me on snapchat and keep
up with my life and as I I'm a pretty
private person and I don't post
everything with snapchat I always try to
keep all my social media channels very
positive because there's already so much
 happening in the world already so I
like to keep things light and positive
and happy and for so many of you to
follow me on there even though I don't
post as much as other youtubers or other
snapchatters that means a lot and I
can't thank you for that enough so thank
you for highlighter I have to use glazed
donut my collaboration a highlighter
with Oprah cosmetics this has been
restocked so if you haven't gotten your
hands on it yet you can do that right
now
and since this is a very fall AF look I
am going there with the lips as well
this is morphe a liquid lipstick in the
colour nibble and then because I'm extra
and it's never enough I'm going in with
this Kat Von D everlasting glimmer veil
and this is in the color rocker and this
is hopefully gonna be very very pretty
first time trying it oh my god oh my god
holy God that's what my heart is feeling
200 excuse me while I die
all right setting spray and we're done
and that guy's concludes my video
playing with the brand-new morphe 35o 2
palette i think if you love warm tones
this will be your holy grill it
literally has every shade of warm brown
in there it's got a lot of coppers it's
got the Reds it is so much warmer than
the original 3500 so if you're all about
that look no more you found your Holy
Grail palette now like I said I also
feel like the quality has improved
greatly we're the previous morphe
palette any good absolutely is this
better
yes because a does remind me quality
wise of the Jaclyn hill palette and that
was like their top quality palette out
there my only little side note is that I
wish we could have taken out one of the
medium warm Browns and add in a very
blinding highlighter shade something
with a very nice golden sheen something
that I put on my inner corners which
wasn't from the morphe palette maybe
perhaps and other than that it's just
personal preference if you like the
color so you're gonna love them if you
hate the colors you're not gonna be all
about this one this palette is launching
October 12th which is tomorrow it will
be available at morphe brushes com
online plus in their store and it
retails for $23 35 shades for $23 plus I
know everyone everyone's gonna say this
but if you want to save some money there
are a billion and one affiliate coats
out there for morphe I want you to use
whoever you like best I want you to
support your favorite youtuber by using
their discount code so you save money
you support them if that is me if you
want to support me my affiliate code is
Nikki and I KK ie it saves you money
online plus in their Burbank store but
again only use it when you want to
support your favorite youtubers and if
you don't then and then don't like
literally then don't so yeah it is now
seven o'clock in the morning I am ready
to take this makeup look off and gotta
catch a plane to Los Angeles and
actually really set to take this off
because I'm living for this look it is
full AF so as always if you enjoyed
