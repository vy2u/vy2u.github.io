today's video is a video that I've been
dreading since forever if you know me if
you follow my channel you know that the
color green makes me mean you know that
the color green is my least favorite
color when it comes to makeup and pretty
much in life I don't know what green has
ever done to me to make me feel this way
but it just makes me feel this way so
I've been hyping up this challenge for a
couple of months now but every time I
got around to doing it I quit
walked away ran away from my studio and
never looked back the color green gives
me anxiety the color green makes me
nervous but most of all very unhappy in
today's video I'm gonna grab the color
green by its balls and make it work
somehow so since I actually never buy
green makeup let me actually find some
green makeup okay I'll be right back
green glitter all right so I have my
green products I think and now it's just
time to get ready with me and face this
green makeup challenge it's it's not
really a challenge it's just a makeup
tutorial of me just using green if you
hate the color green like I do let's
enjoy today's battle
alright so the first thing we're doing
is focusing on skin because this will be
the part that I'll probably enjoy most
cuz it doesn't involve anything green
yet now I know some of you will go use
the green color corrector no they're
already enough green for today so the
first product I'm using or actually is
applied to my face already this is a
brand new moisturizer that I thin loving
it is by the brand q ms q ms and this is
the moisturizing balance moisturizer
this stuff is so good you only need the
tiniest bit and it gives you that
beautiful radiant glow
so that is on my skin right the nails
for primer I'm using the Itachi silk
canvas I feel like I haven't been
talking about this on my channel but
this is currently the best primer of
2018 because it just blurs everything
out it makes everything look so smooth
for foundation today I'm going to be
using the brand new NARS natural radiant
long wear foundation in the color Mont
Blanc and the powerplay foundation my
cover effects I like to add this in to
add more coverage and this is in and 10
I want to know who of you watch the
Eurovision and are big fans of it
actually earlier today on my Instagram I
did an Instagram live with Eleni from
Cyprus who is if you've been following
me on social media you know that she is
my absolute favorite this year that song
that performance is killer so I'm
definitely rooting for Cyprus and I
saved the Instagram live for 24 hours so
if you haven't seen it head over to
advocate tutorials to watch the
Instagram live featuring Cyprus girl
Eleni
and I want to know who you are rooting
for other favorites of mine are Bulgaria
I like Lithuania who else do I also like
Finland song but Cyprus by far my
favorite like so good fuego for
concealer of course and going in with
the Narciso 7 time since I did an actual
tutorial for concealer and going in with
Nara soft matte complete concealed
and setting the under eye is using the
fit me loose powder by Maybelline the
secret to any good eye shadow look is
the pea Louise base so I'm priming with
this for the eyes and on a Mac 252 I'm
just patting this onto the lid to
activate this product you want to Pat it
so go ahead and Pat it now I'm gonna go
into this Apple green shadow color by
Inglot and this is going into my crease
picking it up on a Mac two to one brush
and creating a rounded shape and to
diffuse the edges I'm just using soft
circular motions right at the edge of
that shadow I also go for a very blown
out smoky eye look kind of day so the
further you take this out the more smoky
it's gonna look if you're not too
comfortable with that just keep it
smaller and don't smoke it out as much
now picking up this color by Melchior
cosmetics this is in the color
Citronelle and I'm lending this right
above the green we just applied and
doing so on a morphe m5 fourteen brush
this is really going to give you that
smoked out blown out look now taking the
darkest green shade from this angle
appellate and darkening the outer corner
and doing so on a separate Mac two to
one brush and I make sure I pat on the
color as opposed to buffing the color in
so we're patting on because we want that
pigmentation not to buff out this edge
all you have to do is use soft circular
motions
zip him back into the P Louise base with
a Mac - five - and cutting the lid
okay took him that apple green color
pushing it back over on top of the P
Louise base and also going back with the
darkest green for the center of the lid
I'm taking this pigment right here by P
Louise it's a green pigment this on the
lid is stunning picking it up on an
honest as a Beverly Hills number
eighteen brush and packing it on and
then taking this color right here which
is a white highlighter shape but it has
a green duochrome
and this is going on the inner third
going in with Mac minted ichael as a
base for the shadows on the lower lash
line and I'm just smudging this on and
leaving a tiny little slither of skin
left to highlight later on going back in
with that Inglot dark green shadow and
taking the crown Pro c510 brush to apply
it and since we're going for that super
smoky look notice how I rounded it out
and went very low with it here so we
also have to apply the blending shade
around that too on a crown brushes C 527
brush I'm just dragging that green color
all the way into the inner corner and
then finally opening up that inner
corner using the tiniest line of white
liquid liner finally four lashes some
Lily lashes in lush
and on the center one tiny little lash
to add some definition Oh
oh my god for how green this is I
thought I would hate this but this is
starting to grow on me it might be that
I went for a super blown out smoky eye
look so it definitely gives me more of
like an editorial kind of drag look but
I am liking this so far what is
happening to me all right so I
definitely want to bronze my skin
because of all the greens it's kind of
making me look a little washed out so
I'm going in with this Mac next to
nothing powder in medium dark casually
trying to make my seven head of forehead
even though I will probably only got
close to a six head time for a little
hint of blush just a tiny bit pairing a
coral cheek with a green eye is so good
to me right now and then highlighter at
last I'm going in with that greeny shade
that I used for the inner corners too
because I feel like it will really tie
everything in with each other so let's
do that
okay okay you know this is sort of
turning into a glam Hulk look and I'm
here for it now when it comes to lips
there's options believe it or not we
have into beauty midnight wasabi which
is this which might make it a little too
green I mean I'm finally liking some
green on my face I don't want to kill
the experience then I have color train
IV I'm like
a lot and finally Kylie cosmetics trick
which is like a dark green blue ish
color I should probably go for the IV
one cuz it excited me when I said it
post my dog's name is ivy so this one's
salon oh my god I'm pushing my
boundaries alright some setting spray
and we're done you know what I don't
think I did all that bad and I might go
as crazy essing I'm really digging this
look would I wear this outside with this
lip absolutely not well this would be
perfect for Instagram probably hopefully
give it a like the overall look it's a
mean Hulk suddenly this became the
Avengers infinity war hulk glam look so
thank you so much for watching as always
never forget to give this video a thumbs
up if you enjoyed watching it and don't
forget to subscribe to my channel I love

will be hopefully a fun video too bye
