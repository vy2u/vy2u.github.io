to the most wonderful week today is the
kickoff the start of winter Wonder week
2017 if you're new to my channel hello
it's so amazing to have you here every
December every year I have a special
week and we called a winter wonder week
and is a week where I upload a brand new
video every day for seven days and today
is number one I guess what this year I'm
gonna make it even more special because
I have a really really fun surprise with
every winter Wonder week episode so
every day I will be doing a giveaway
towards the end of the video and my
original plan was to kind of build up
and let the end of the week have the
most amazing prizes out there but I must
say that today's giveaway is pretty lit
as well so you definitely don't want to
miss it so every winter wonder week day
there's a giveaway towards the end of
the video so you don't want to skip
anything and if you skip this intro all
the way towards the outer of this video
just for the giveaway you're mean and
rude and you shouldn't live your life
like that but I understand please do
come back because you don't want to miss
out on the good stuff which is the
makeup so in today's video I'm gonna be
doing a video that has been so requested
for me it has been so it has been such a
thing for me because I've been dreading
it since I started doing makeup you
probably read it from the title already
but today's video is gonna be my natural
makeup challenge again if you're new to
my channel um hello my name is Nikki and
I am a full-coverage glow Queen addict I
love a full coverage layer I love the
k-cup I love all the makeup the more the
merrier I'm not the channel that people
really go to for natural makeup tips so
natural makeup I can do it I mean I can
do it I've been working as a makeup
artist for so so long now and whenever I
do a photoshoot on models or I work for
TV people do natural stuff and I can do
it it's just not my favorite thing to do
and so when I have the option to do my
own makeup I take it on so
in today's video I'm gonna treat myself
like I'm my client I'm gonna trade
myself like I'm my model and if you
follow me on snapchat or Instagram
stories nikkietutorials you know that
over the last couple of weeks I've sort
of been experimenting with this I've
been trying more natural looks than
people on Twitter have been going crazy
because they were like wait you do know
how to do it what is this so today's
video is my natural makeup challenge
welcome to winter Wonder week day 1 and
let the natural makeup commence real
quick before we begin can you tell that
I'm doing a natural makeup look so I
stacked on the jewelry I stacked on the
earrings I looked at this hair
holographic backdrop I'm gonna
compensate for not wearing a makeup
Factory on my face today oh my god I
don't even know like where to start
right now because I'm used to like
priming and then we'll play them alright
let's start off so the first thing I'm
gonna do is go in with my Hooda Beauty
angel-food No so the first thing I'm
gonna do is go in with mesh you a
essential hai covers alright the first
thing I'm gonna do is to walk on my sir
I'll just aside the first thing imma do
is prime and I'm gonna be pregnant well
there's two options well there's a lot
of options when it comes to makeup but
these are my two options right now what
I like to do when going for a more
natural look is really glowing it up
because you want to blind them to sort
of like not make them see that you're
not wearing all that much makeup my two
favorite options for this are the
amazing cosmetics illuminate primer
highlighter in glow I've been really
really loving this because I put this on
and my face is super duper glowy but it
also keeps any oils at bay another
option is strobe cream by Mac this one
is in the color silver light but I feel
like strobe cream by Mac just gives you
moisture and adieu and not really
anything priming wise so I I'm gonna mix
the two I'm gonna mix it too isn't it
weird how I can literally feel sad that
I'm not doing like a full glam look
right now
so used to the fact that when I sit down
in my studio that something very intense
and glam is about to happen on my face
and now there isn't and it's very hard
for me to adjust and sort of give up on
the full coverages I feel like this is
turning into a documentary on me being
addicted to full coverage Ness the
reason part of the reason why I love
full coverage foundation is because
often you'll see that my ears are super
super red this is the same for my entire
face region when I get hot or it's warm
in a room I get red I used to get
bullied so much during PE for getting a
red face and I was so ashamed and every
even now to this day when I work out and
I'm not wearing any makeup
I'm I don't ever wear makeup when I'm
working out but like when I work out and
I get that red face I always feel so
ashamed and self-conscious but I kind of
learned to let go in the gym but for
day-to-day life I rather cover up the
redness because it makes me feel
insecure what I want to do is conceal
definitely my under eyes and like any
like shadowy stuff on my face so I'm
gonna be starting off with the Charlotte
Tilbury retouch her now any product that
you feel like needs a little bit more
coverage in your routine apply to the
skin and let it sit there for a little
bit any product that you let dry on the
skin a little bit more will get more
coverage and more opacity all right so
now take them a beauty sponge and daven
it in although there's like literally
almost nothing to dab in I don't like
this I want to stop doing this challenge
and whip out the glitter now so my under
eyes crease and my eyes just in general
crease like crazy so I do have to set
that with a powder if I'm going for full
coverage or a natural coverage I need to
powder my under eyes because if I don't
they will look like trash
and lightly sitting around my nose using
the laura mercier
mache Mercy Mercy Merce somewhat using
the loose powder to kind of DAB on the
shine let's focus a little bit on brows
I'm just gonna put a little bit of brow
gel in them this is by Dior this is
called the Dior show bold brow mascara
brow mascara and I'm just gonna brush
this through the hairs and define using
a little bit of concealer time for eyes
and for the eyes I like it to be super
super bear but highlight it and a tiny
bit of a lash so first that's prime so
I'm gonna prime my eyeballs using some
soft ochre Paint Pot by Mac so for eyes
I mean is one of my favorite palettes on
the market The Deuce by gvs place and
first I'm going to add a little bit of
definition using this shade right here
on the outer portion of my eye and this
is called berry mousse and this is going
mainly right here on that outer portion
for literally the tiniest bit of
definition
now I'm a highlight like crazy first
gonna go in with this color right here
and then a little bit of that color
right there as well to give a pinky er
fresh highlight first I'm hitting it on
the inner corners now I'm starting to
like this video hello we have arrived
into this channel now we're talking
literally give me anything reflective or
shiny and I'll be alright I'll be okay
like see how that totally lives up the
look like all of a sudden I have
forgotten about my red cheek my red
jawline alright on to more fun stuff I'm
gonna curl my lashes and put some
mascara on them to bring back some depth
into this face into this blob of flesh
and if you don't know what I'm doing
right now I am heating up my eyelash
curler because I have very straight
lashes that don't want to stay up if I
curl them so this is sort of like using
a hot curling iron on your lashes so
make sure it is okay to the skin I mean
you can curl it up to heaven to keep it
there right at the gates of heaven then
I go in with a waterproof mascara to
hold that curl up with the wrist okay
and then for a photo shoot earlier I cut
up a couple of wispy lashes and what I
did was I put him on the outer portion
of my eye to sort of still get that
flick of an eyeliner without the
eyeliner so putting three very wispy
lashes towards the end of the eye gives
you that nice little swoop and will give
your eyes a little bit more definition
see what that is doing it's giving you
the feel of a very cat I like a lie nerd
cat I but it's just a couple of flashes
towards the end of the eye I love this
trick right here this made the video
alright the light at the end of the
tunnel is in sight so now I'm gonna
bronze my face you bring back some color
and fur this is going to be using medium
dark next to nothing pressed powder by
Mac for blush I definitely want to bring
back that glow so I'm gonna go in with
this right here this is my Mac this is
an extra dimension blush in fairly
precious and bring back that natural
radiance slash flesh I also kind of
graze it over my nose to bring back
color over there as well and I'm
definitely not holding back on the
highlighter either so first I'm gonna go
in with these yvonne cheese slime
highlighter which i just did a video on
and this gives that very natural do enos
to the face so I'm gonna put this pretty
much everywhere and then wherever I want
more of a glow I pack some nylon
eyeshadow by Mac over top notice how my
spirit is so much more uplifted now that
we have reached the stage of
highlighting and I must say after doing
blush and bronzing and doing the lashes
I am not noticing the less of a cover to
anymore but anyways let's uh this
highlight
all right so I've almost made it towards
the end of this natural makeup challenge
all that awaits me are my lips and I'm
going to go for a nude glossy lip first
I'm going to line using these you a pink
champagne shimmer long-wear lip liner
then a nice new lip and on top the fancy
beauty gloss balm infinity glow
and last but certainly not least setting
spray and that guy's concludes this
natural makeup challenge it has been a
ride but oh my oh my we have made it
towards the end so in the end I
definitely like what I'm looking at I
feel like the eyes are so soft and
flirty I mean I could have gone with a
little bit of a shorter lash but I mean
who cares at this point I feel like the
skin looks very dewy and healthy
I could have toned down the bronzer a
little bit again this is such a huge
step for me in my makeup routine because
I always pound it on and today it was
such a change to like keep it light and
to not go all the way so I hope some of
you are proud of me because I I kind of
really am proud of myself for not taking
it on and actually doing this challenge
