post and it will tell you what to do to
enter yourself for this giveaway right
here and if you're in the mood to see me
compare a drugstore full-coverage
foundation to my Holy Grail foundation
then click on the video that appears in
the screen right now it's a nice little
battle I make a battle you knew this
step was coming hah the fit me loose
powder in Oh 5 I'm gonna set my under
eyes with that first we're gonna pry my
eyelid using this select cover-up
concealer by Mac this is not soft ochre
paint pop it I've been seeing a lot of
UK artists use this as a primer so let
me go ahead and try it too the first
shade of going in with is by the Zulu
palette by Juvia splays and it's the
fiery orange and I'm applying this into
the crease using a zoeva 2 to 7 brush
and go ahead and buff and blend that out
big once that is the pie to go in with
the yellow and apply just a little bit
above as a softer transition and doing
so on a Mac two to one brush and you
definitely want to keep your brush very
soft to the skin so don't put too much
pressure on it just very small feathery
strokes this is one of those looks that
looks atrocious till the very last step
which is flashes so if at any point you
are recreating just looking you're like
oh my god what is this nonsense wait
till the very end don't give up apply
the lashes and boom it pulls it together
honey same palette going in with the
purple and because we have applied the
orange the purple is not going to grip
onto the lid as much as you would do it
on a clean base a trick to make your eye
should a super super pigmented is by
applying them over something sticky aka
the concealer which was our first step
but because we have applied the orange
we have lost that stickiness so you will
see that the purple looks very faded and
messy until we go back in with something
sticky to get that power back does that
make sense
so for this first portion it's gonna
look very very messy but then we're
gonna fix it a couple moments later I'm
basically using the purple as a next
transition step for the darkest color on
the lid
okay on the outer and inner corner of
the lid on going into the dubious place
magic palette and I want to go in with
this shade right here and I'm applying
it right there but because we have lost
all stickiness from applying the shadow
over top of the base I'm reapplying a
bit of that concealer to get the
stickiness back for maximum coverage and
I personally love this shade even though
it's hard to blend but I love it because
it's a different twist than the usual
black now I'm cutting the lit using a
little bit of that same concealer and
I'm doing a spotlight smokey eye so it's
just focused on the center still working
with the jus villa's magic palette and
taking this shade right here to set the
sides of the lid that we just carved out
so going on this outer portion here
blending it in and also on the inner
portion here and also blending that and
now this look is finally starting to
come together it looked like a very hot
mess all this time but now we can see
something coming to the horizon and then
on that center portion I'm applying a
bit of the NYX glitter primer and then
finally sticking the hollow glitter
overtop a hollow party
all right quickly highlighting my brow
bone and highlighting my inner corners
using an icy blue highlighter shade
smoking out that waterline using a black
hole this is my shoe and setting that
and smoking it out using a black shadow
and mine is also Baiju vias place called
Chad alright oh it's been very long and
intense but you made it and it's finally
time for lashes these are dull Beauty
lashes in Eva okay so I think this is
one of the most extravagant looks I've
ever done in my entire career
of course inspiration is taken from
Mitchell and Stacey Murray makeup artist
on Instagram those two are like my
biggest inspirations and when it comes
to makeup and basically I was channeling
them so I hope I do them proud as well
as well as Christine Hollow Queen so
focusing on the face now the bronze next
to nothing powder in medium dark brush
doing it we're on zoom bronzing grows
font or and while we're at it
creating cheekbones where there aren't a
nice glowy blush on those apples and
working it back and for my clone that'll
be taking this dull beauty dull light
highlighter and shine note like a
diamond it's called like it just see
that like a diamond and then to finish
her lips I think it's smartest too
because this is so intense
let's focus on this and not anything
else except for the glow so I'm gonna go
for nude glossy lips I just feel like it
will give the most balance
so first going in with the shoe a long
wear lip cream liner in pink champagne
shimmer my favorite and then from
lipstick I'm gonna take this L'Oreal
Bhama urban Safari nude lipstick bomb oh
oh man boom ah
oh man artists bomb ah
and then over top to add some color and
depth this Fenty beauty lip gloss in the
color spits a cosmic gloss cosmic gloss
in the car spacesuit and to seal the
deal some settings brave and that guys
is this magical New Year's Eve glitter
