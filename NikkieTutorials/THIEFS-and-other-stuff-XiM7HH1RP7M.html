stuff and it really pissed me off
like so as some of you might know I play
soccer at this team and yesterday we
needed to go to another team to play
against them and we won and when we came
back into our changing rooms we found
out some things were stolen sorry dog
with like um just like a lot of you had
my sock so this other girl on my team
came like wait wait my thoughts are gone
too and so the other girl on my team
came with a Colin like worth my vest so
we find out my socks and two of my other
girls teens socks and that's were stolen
and then I opened my bag and my wallet
was gone it had everything in it it had
my bank card in it it had my ID card in
it it had my head mine it had my school
passed and had my discount cards from
different stores it had money in it it
had my first dates cinema ticket still
in it
so right now me and my mom are going to
cancel my band car together new ID card
get new discount cards get a new school
pass on you can read like what is so
funny about stealing someone's socks a
vest and a wallet there's another story
and that is quite funny actually the
last two weeks
everyone in my area I found out about my
videos everyone knows it right now the
entire school knows it all my friends
knows that know it all my teachers know
it my family knows it everyone knows it
and I am pretty happy with that actually
but with the case of my wallet now
stolen it might be freak who did it you
never know so yeah well that's stolen my
entire area knows about my videos
because I was featured on the front page
of YouTube which is um I also got some
random stuff to show you guys I'm gonna
do a look with this as an eye catcher
because this is the beast black
cosmetics glitter and purple and um I
seriously did I
I wear it almost every day I have this
new color combo which is really neutral
but this makes it really popping bright
and pull so I'm gonna do a look on that
and you guys are going to love this so
get your hands on this before I post it
so you can immediately do this look so
get this at the link in the sidebar also
I have this new eyeshadow which I love
and it's by glamour doll eyes and it is
called chocoholic oh my god oh my god
this is like a deep deep warm brown
bronze color I love it I seriously love
it um a brilliant brunette did a look on
it wit on our blog post and I was like
wait what I have that and I worn it and
I was like I'm also gorgeous this is a
gosh extreme art eyeliner and these are
exact we like the max I'm like liquid
glass liners like this is max molten
soul and this is gosh number eleven Mac
is a little bit tinier and this one has
a little bit more product which is good
because in my opinion the Matt Munns
rock your socks off the gosh ones rock
your socks and pants off I'm wearing
that one right now and I really love it
another thing I got was a new mascara I
wanted to get a new mascara I used my
false lash effect like Max Factor for so
long and I was like it's like the best
mascara for me ever but I wanted to
change you know I like to change things
up a little bit now and then and um I
was going to my on drugstore and I
tested all these mascara out the wand on
my hand and it's just consistency and I
found L'Oreal no one I found or actually
got is the L'Oreal Paris flash architect
and I love this it makes my lashes super
duper long like it makes them
ten times longer than with my Max Factor
so this is the packaging put packaging
really cool then the bond looks like
that like it has a really skinny one
which is quite long and it has curves in
it like really teeny Kurt's you can see
that it has a curve in it
another thing I got are another couple
of contact lenses from Anniston Holland
this time I got magic blue which is like
um circle lenses you know you know servo
lenses you know and balloon and since I
have greenish blue eyes you can see a
stroke of green and then it starts
blowing so I got these and I will be
doing a look on blue eyes are really
soon with these in and then left best
you guys if you watch me for a longer
time right now in February I did a
favorites video and I grieved about this
Britney Spears fantasy perfume smell and
I had the smallest bottle of them all my
friends my best friend's my two best
friends went on holiday and this that
day would get me a present
and I was like looking I'm going to get
a bracelet or earrings or I don't know
what what they came back
this britney Spears's fantasy is my
signature now I I love it I cannot stop
wearing it ever since I got it and my
old bottle was empty I almost killed
myself because they really loved it but
with two best friends came with this and
look at the size oh my god oh my god
this is my old one which is pretty much
empty it still has a little bit left
why can you see that so it's a little
bit left which I can take out I don't
know how to take it out but I love this
and this is the other one for my
friend's death girls I love you I you
know I loved you before but I love you
even more right now I love you guys so
