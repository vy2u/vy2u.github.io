and just my entire life to go to my your
cast thing tomorrow with my friends I'm
going on holiday I just decided to sneak
in a quick video on my top 10 favorite
summer product beauty product things
things so because I'm leaving for a sort
of sunny holiday tomorrow Spain Majorca
I was like I am going to do my top 10
summer products that I love for the
summer yay so that is what I'm gonna do
today and let's go so the first product
you don't want to live without this
summer is a primer for your face because
if you're gonna put foundation on or a
concealer and everything you want it to
last the entire day with the hot weather
and sweat and everything and just water
and so many moist things so the first
thing on my list is the professional by
benefit and I have multiple primers that
I really like I like the professional by
benefit I like the prep and prime Mac
skin basic features I like that a lot
and I like the Make Up For Ever HD
primer so these three are really good to
prime your face with I do find that the
HD primer by Makeup Forever tends to
break me out quite a bit it's like it
doesn't give me like pimple pimples but
it gives me like like underneath the
surface of my skin sort of bumps and
oozes and I probably shouldn't be using
it for a foundation now of course I get
it that people don't want to wear a
foundation with hot weather when it's
really really hot outside I went up
those people like I either wear like a
shitload of foundation or like nothing
so I just kind of need everything when
I'm going out through the makeup a great
foundation for summer is d-max a
somebody these are my favourite
foundations on models on photo shoots or
like on Bridal makeup or just like
client makeup because this works on
everyone except if you're really oily if
you're a really ugly skinned person then
skip on these but I love these and why I
love these is because these dry in a
waterproof
sort of layer I love the face of bodies
I just I can't get enough of them I'm
wearing it today I'm not mixing anything
else with it this is just face and buddy
on my face this is white and Siwon then
concealer really important concealer is
one of those friends in our makeup stash
that tends to crease on us well it does
mean I found a concealer about two years
ago and this is the Mac Pro Longwear
concealer this stuff does increase
underneath your eyes wherever you're
putting in this is insanely good it just
does increase so that's perfect first
time I stood together with the
waterproof face and body and the pro
longwear concealer you're like base is
good to go for on a hot humid day um to
further bronze up my face in summer I
found a new product by the Kardashian
sisters and like her - answers sort of
like my love-hate guilty-pleasure like
one day I love the Kardashians and then
the other day I'm just like up born I
just like like really there's
legitimately like spit on my wall I'm
disgusting but the Kardashian sisters
have their own makeup line they first
called a Croma Beauty got sued
Kardashian beauty Kardashian beauty has
a bronzer and this is the endless summer
the bronzer it's probably just called
bronzer the Kardashian bronzer and this
is endless summer number 520 and this
little thing right here is so nifty
because you have a darker shade a medium
shade and a lighter shade so you can
just take one of the shades and bronze
your face up or just mix them together
and have like a medium shade I love this
it's really good I love the packaging
it's rose gold and just I really like
this bronzer I never expected to like
something makeup wise from the car -
just and I was just like oh my gosh
Khloe I love this so much a pigment that
I really like for summer is my Mac and
this is blonds gold this is just your
typical sort of like wearable like
champagne gold color this news everyone
it suits me I'm wearing it on my eyelids
today it's just
darker skin because it's a really nice
inner corner highlight for darker skin
ladies and guys and I shadowed I've been
really loving for summer is by makeup
studio and this is number 14 and I know
this might look a little bit chalking
and it is a little bit talking but this
is the perfect ochre yellow color for
summer personally me and my boss the
skull tester we teach a B Academy and we
love ochre yellow for makeup we love it
and Mac had an ochre yellow shadow that
was amazing but it can discontinue than
never to be seen again
but then makeup studio has number 14 and
this is like almost to say when it's
amazingly pretty and just this can warm
up your crease without any problems or
whatsoever I'm wearing it around my
crease so what is around my crease is a
number 14 by makeup studio and just use
a really light hand with this and it's
just perfect and my mom sells it in her
webshop hexose news guys dot and out
another really fun new product is by
collistar and these are the jewel eye
shadow stress effects not stressed but
just I have like a sweaty upper lip it's
like 45 degrees outside right now
sweating my skin off here and these are
glittery creams that dry into a glittery
powder these are a summer must-have this
is the copper one this is called number
one mmm it have made rain don't know and
this is number tun this is a light
yellow gold and this is called number
two serbia so the color star jewel I
shed Olas effects are stunning I did a
full blog post review on these on my
blog and you get tutorials comment I
will put the link down below check that
blog post out for full swatches and
review my go-to lipstick for summer it's
a lipstick I'm wearing right now this is
the Nicki Minaj Viva Glam number 1 by
Mac I don't know if they still sell this
at these stores or the counters or
whatever but you can still get this on
eBay and everything or CCOs
I love this color I've never really paid
attention to it when it first launched
it's just
summer it's bright it's fresh it's this
is my oh so guilty pleasure Britney
Spears perfume and what was this called
fantasy fantasy I have wait for it I
have number one number two and number
three I had four bottles of like a
hoarder it's so sweet and so much like a
sweet sweet candy that a lot of people
find this too much like too sweet and
too much of like candy but I just I this
is my smell guys this was my smell like
I've been talking about this for years
and years and worth is when I was like
13 on high school and like from 13 till
my 17th like everyday and then I just
got over it and now I'm just like
rekindling the love I love a fantasy by
britney spears it's the ultimate summer
scent and it's just it's like a
no-brainer I love this then so much well
you could tell by mouth don't judge here
don't judge and last but not least this
Black Milk clothing bathing suits I love
it so much this is the Sheena queen of
the jungle bathing suit and I oh my gosh
this is so me it is red it has a blonde
girl riding on a zebra on it and this
just screams my name I just I love it
and you can like let your tummy rest for
a bit and the bathing suit in my opinion
and they're so good for your boobs to
these babies so they just kind of crush
your boobs in it if you like them nice
plump effect talking about boobs now so
