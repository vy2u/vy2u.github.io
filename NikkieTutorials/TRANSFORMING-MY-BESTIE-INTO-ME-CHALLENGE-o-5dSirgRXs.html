she's back she Beckett out actually I am
Wow today Kim and I are doing something
really really fun we are going to
transform kim tae in to take a
territorial I'm so excited we're so
we're kind of really nervous right now
we are calling this the transforming my
best friend into me challenge and we saw
this video first on Beauty vixen and
they were so incredibly political
identical I don't feel like we are gonna
okay I just went I got a little tan okay
you know when she was blonde she got a
lot of common things I never agreed we
should insert a picture insert a picture
wow we are going to I so nervous right
now I feel like a really fun
okay so without any further ado we are
going to grab the brushes we're going to
grab the cake mother it on and we're
going to transform you into Kim tutorial
so let's do it
that's me I didn't package oppose it
okay give me one over sister and if he
got like so looking in the distance
ready just palling a slave for dinner oh
oh I feel closer I'm a vision of the
unique first of all go in with the J 1
jelly pack dramatic firming skin was
impressive
so this is like a glue I love well um I
think everyone knows that I love a
really sticky primers because that will
really make the foundation stick onto it
so that's a doing oh look now we're
going to go on to just a tiny bit of
foundation just a little bit you know
because I like a really soft Lyle in
like a breathing I personally love a
good full coverage it like it gets me in
play
said I just feel really good with a good
full beef we're going to do that on cam
as well because basically everything
that I do on my face is also what we're
doing on cam safe look are pretty good
I'm stunning I'm going over her lips see
people always ask me why I do this I do
this because once you go in with
lipstick it pops more I have very
pigmented lips to myself so when I put a
lipstick over top of that it's like
mixing any lipstick with a shade of red
and it just alters it so I always blink
it out so with a full coverage like this
you almost Jo need any concealer but
we're going to ignore that rule because
I love consumer focus dabbing some of
the concealer on so I have a bigger
forehead yours is smaller so by taking
the highlight color higher up you're
kind of you know copying that girl have
you seen mark
girl your face can fit in my forehead
can you see that I was just talking to
Kim Chi who is an amazing drag queen
from RuPaul's Drag Race and we talked
about the fact that we have really big
spaces and I told her that I always look
like the Hulk
photo because it's always like a tiny
face and then there's me and she gave a
really good tips
she's like make sure when you're doing a
selfie with someone let them do it so
they're up front and your side in the
back
that is on you are looking like a blank
canvas
okay ready for it the bank and then now
I'm going to grab some airspun sell
affordable and amazing and we're going
to beat the mug you might have seen this
technique on Patrick or your favorite
blue tall trackers Queens has never done
this so this will literally keep the
makeup on through like mannequins but a
pretty one basically just sets the
foundation so hardcore it doesn't go
anywhere once you go in with your
setting spray and all that I feel like I
use BB cream confetti
so it's going to look powdery until the
very end
because in the end we're going to spray
like a like a matte person and that's
really going to tie it all back in next
move on to brows so mine are on line or
prepare a very soft one okay I can do
this I believe in you I don't
okay
you see I see yeah okay hmm like my
right eyebrow was adopted
I like it a low-key really one Jen
tonight
mm-hmm keep it brush your love is brunch
cinnamon flavor favorite trick creating
the seekers of front
my favorite trick oh yeah I'm seeing off
because our nother thicker than a
cynical this is so freaky I'm seeing my
brow is so weird to see that's a little
of the same route that's my brow are
your Bettis weird
easy breezy beautiful
to see crazy beautiful hurt
preying on to what going in was a medium
brown OD o out of corner rushing some of
this brown it hard to work on Asian eyes
no you just cure a little bit more
limited like space wise but usually on
Asian eyes
I like focusing more on the lash line
and then blowing it out then was up
clean blending brush just going to hit D
I just hope you look like me cuz right
now I don't feel like you look like me
now with the wing I will remember when I
had long hair so basically you could
come in with your own makeup done took
my wig on and call it a day now we're
going to go in with a darker purple ito
t-shaped
to darken the outer corners even more
still good
I'm going to go in with this milk eye
pigment in Gig and we're going to use
this as a base to cut the lid this is
going to be so pretty
oh so we've got the top I'd done this is
a look in and of itself I kick it throw
some lashes on a glossy lip and you're
done very beautiful but to make you look
more like me we need a very smoky lower
lash line which I never never do I'm
never dying you with one new lower
lashes so weird to do to even touch that
lower lash line of yours I'm creating a
new inner corner
now to really change her eye shape I'm
going to go in with white liquid liner
right on that new inner corner you're
doing amazing sweetie so now what we're
going to do Kim is I'm going to have you
put some lion-hearted lashes on
so lashes on right not right now and
it's out right now and now we're going
to Bronk you up I always contour with
the bronzer a little bit as well
that's it brush it whoo now I kind of go
from here to there
so when I contour my nose I always do
the bottom just the bottom that's what I
do and Kim already does what I do when I
contour my nose I do a little shadow so
it gives that button look we already
have that see okay now we're going to
contour just intensifying that a little
Jewish this looks so good
you did such a good job you're welcome
Finn ever blush also higher up to lift
the cheek not necessarily on the apples
of the cheeks because that's going to
bring it down again I want everything to
be eliminated and that is a small brush
on you I like that because you really
have full control over where blush goes
okay for my baby
so for Kim I'm going to go in with the
lightest and the medium shade on my
favorite highlighting brush free Morris
number two girl
yup she's me so this one first this is
Charlotte Tilbury
pillow talk that's a pretty color and
this one on the center two legs and you
can make a pretty light because my new
lips are always light for gloss I'm
going to be using this vivid hot lacquer
and number sixty T's by Maybelline
now we're going to set it and forget it
and I always use sorry Jacqueline
amusing your palate for this I always
use a lot more setting spray because you
saw all that powder that I used in the
beginning and you want to make sure that
that's all melts into the skin and
becomes skin again okay Seifer the wig
going to see how this is oh my god hell
no oh my god Jim Jim your head is huge
Jim is did this freaky we're just
coloring Kim black hair to metric oh my
god
