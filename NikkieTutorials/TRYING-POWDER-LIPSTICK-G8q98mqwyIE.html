day two of winter wonder week I want to
thank you before we start with anything
I want to personally thank you for an
amazing start for day one being an
absolute smasher first of all it almost
broke my record for most views in the
first hour of my entire career so thank
you so much it got so many comments it
got so many likes you guys are going in
on the giveaway and thank you so much
for making this an unforgettable fun and
amazing week and I want to thank you so
much and let's just continue on living
it up here on the channel so Merry
Christmas
today is Christmas so I hope you're
having an amazing Christmas day I hope
you're spending it with family your
loved ones and your friends and I hope
you are stuffing your face with all that
food and what did you get for presents
did you get makeup today I wanted to
focus on a product by Chanel and as you
can see I already did my eyes brows and
mostly of the base and I'm missing one
key thing which is highlighter no I'm
kidding I am missing highlighter but I'm
keeping that for till the end you're
missing lipstick and I bumped into this
right here this is Chanel's pudica I
live live I live free I live I live oh
god this is a lipstick powder I said
wait now this right here is a lipstick
powder a lipstick which is the powder
and I got the color for 10 Russell
pompano and Yaya Yaya I got the color
for 10 Rosso pumping y'know I need help
as soon as I saw that it said lip powder
I was like thank you so when I look
online and go to the Chanel website it
says that this is a limited edition duo
that features a colorful matte powder
that can be worn alone or mixed with the
moisturizing balm for a blurred artistic
effect both on cheeks and lips with as
much or as
intensity as desired we actually took a
look real quick
yes so this is what it looks like bomb
powder and two brushes so today we're
gonna be focusing on this we're gonna be
trying it out on the lips combined alone
on the cheeks maybe even a little bit of
a spruce on the eyes and let's see if
this is any good on winter wonder week
day two because this is 37 dollars so it
better do my laundry and spray perfume
on it too so let's get ready and see how
this goes already so here we are for
eyes today I went for my usual bronzy
smokiness but I added a couple of
Christmasy twists cuz it's Christmas
y'all so when I look at this I see a
clear balm and I see something that
looks like a little blending brush then
it comes with a sponge applicator simply
no logical is freaking out right now and
then with the powder and the powder
let's do a little swatch is ooh that's
got some pigment to it hello oh well
okay we'll see what that looks like on
the lips cuz that's where it actually
matters
alright so I'm gonna be trying this in a
couple of different manners first I'm
gonna do it on top of a nude foundation
lip to see what the pigment is actually
gonna do and I'm gonna apply a dry first
so here we go
lipstick powder is it any good let's
find out so I'm starting off the
toughing it into the inner sort of rim
this is giving me a very k-beauty style
lip they like to keep the lips bare and
then the inner rim has that like fleshy
sort of reddish color and then it kind
of fades out into nothing and this
really gives me that vibe it also gives
me the vibe as if I'm a vampire and I
just sucked on some blood but my nude
lips it's so far so good I feel like the
pigment of the lip powder is pretty
intense but it's a nice opacity where if
you apply one little layer like I'm
doing we're down to my top lip it's nice
and soft but it's buildable which is
good so let's go for a k-beauty style
lip for the first try out because I
never do that and I'd like to see
something different on my face for once
okay so now we've definitely got a
k-beauty lift going on and all I missing
now is a little bit of gloss so I'm
gonna go in with this gloss right here
it's a clear very sparkly gloss that I'm
gonna lay on top of this and this gloss
by the way is by peaches and cream and
it's their lip gloss and the color
diamond and it's one of my favorites
like you see all those sparkles right
this gloss is amazing alright this duo
right here is a winner this should now
lib duo with this gloss by peaches and
cream is ace to do you see how beautiful
that I love this it looks so fresh and
it gives you color on the lips without
going to too far and that's sparkle I
surrender to the sparkle the sparkle
hasn't be dead okay here you go a little
friend you have been a rock star that
actually has me wondering should I do a
cave beauty inspired video sometime soon
like a Korean beauty inspired makeup
tutorial definitely let me know I've
never done something like it it's so
different from what I usually do to my
face so maybe that could be interesting
alright now I want to try it in
combination with the balm so first I'm
gonna pick up the bomb using my finger
and I'm gonna lay it on top of my lip to
get a nice sticky base that's a very
weak balm hello
this by far is one of the thinnest in
consistency lip balms I've ever touched
in my life I mean I'm over here like
okay shadow for $37.00 she could have
made the lip balm a little bit more
thick
like I have been pounding it onto my
lips for at least two minutes now and it
still feels like there's always nothing
there but maybe this is the perfect
formula for the lip palate find out
dipping my brush back into the powder
okay
wait let me actually try this with my
finger too hello and using the brush to
get into the corners kind of stamping
the color onto the bone and this way you
can actually apply it like a full-on
lipstick but it's matte in some areas it
looks a little bit less intense in some
areas it's a little less exaggerated
overall it gives the lips a very nice
velvet touch with it's sort of like a
powdered velvet finish which is exactly
what it is but it actually looks like
that so in some areas the pigmentation
is a little bit stronger it just adheres
to the balm a little bit more than in
other areas but it looks pretty and for
maximum product pickup I just kind of
scratch the brush in there sort of
zigzag the brush in there and that's
when you got full pigment from the lip
powder I don't know why but I'm so
fascinated by this product it looks so
cool it's definitely such a different
finish from anything out there right now
alright so that is what the lip balm and
the lip powder look like combined
stamped on top and it gives you like I
set this very very velvet finish matte
lip so that is what it looks like and
I've been thinking as I'm applying this
I'm like wow this could either be the
most long-lasting matte lip out there
but then when you think about it it's
not because if you get this wet with
water it's a powder stamped on top of a
lip balm get this wet and it's gone like
this will run this will smear this will
go everywhere it's just powder locked on
top of a balm so that's not really gonna
last all that long it feels nice and
comfortable on the lips it's not like
super super drying I have liquid
lipsticks that are so much more drawing
than this and this actually feels like
there's barely anything on there it's
almost like that feeling when you have
lip balm on your lips and you've had it
on for a couple of hours and it's almost
gone that is what it feels like on the
lips right now it's nice and comfortable
it looks nice it's not the most precise
but it looks nice I want to set this
with a gloss and see how it reacts to a
gloss on top and guess what I have
another peaches-and-cream gloss this is
a pinky color and this one is in the
color dolly and I want to stamp this on
top too to see how it reacts
oh hello as you can see it did tend to
the glosso like the powder a little bit
more so did pick it up a little bit but
still on the lips is looking really
really pretty and festive
so now let's keep this on the lips for a
little bit longer and see how it wears
and now I also because it did say that
you can apply this to the cheek so I do
want to spruce up my cheeks a little bit
I feel like there's color but there
could be more color so I'm going in with
this Sigma f-35 and pick up a tiny bit
of the powder when looking at the powder
itself it's definitely nothing like an
eye shadow an eye shadow has sort of
like that buttery feel to it this is
very loose and dry so picking up a
little bit of that on this brush and
sprucing up
oh honey calm it down sprucing up the
cheeks a tiny bit okay not too bad well
I am the color of paper but I feel like
this is almost a little bit too
pigmented for like look you can't even
see it on my brush but then you do see
it on my face so this is a a weird see
how that just as a boost of color and
you didn't even see it on the brush so
that tells you that this powder is full
and full of pigment I want to know what
I do I'm gonna dip my brush into the
powder and work it on too and work it
onto my under eyes here to sort of tie
everything together even that boy that
warmed it up yep its warming it up see
it's warming up the shadows I applied
underneath my eye I mean by no means
would I apply this straight into the
crease and do like a full-on look with
it but I feel like if you have a shadow
or you have a look and you wear like
really warm lips and you want to tie
everything in with each other
you can use this powder to sort of go
over top of what you applied already and
warm it up a little bit like I just did
and it totally works for that yeah so
I'm gonna now put some setting spray on
and give you my final thoughts
alright so these
should now put it I live live live lip
powder and bomb duo I'm really impressed
when I got my hands on this product and
read about it I was like that's never
gonna look good I love how it can go on
the cheeks it can go on the eyes to warm
up whatever you've done already it can
go on the lips you can do a case a
beauty lip with it you can do a full-on
lip with it and put gloss over top I
think this is a very all-round pretty
product but I also don't feel the need
or like urge to tell you that you need
to run out of your house now and get
your hands on it as soon as you can the
lip balm in my opinion could be a little
bit thicker and have more density right
now it's very thin it's not really there
and it doesn't really do much and I
really really like the powder it's a
unique type of powder because like I
said it's thinner and it has a little
bit of kick back into the case itself
but when applied it is pigmented and
goes for miles and you can build it up
and really intensify it so the powder
itself I really like I also love the
color and looking on the website they
have two more colors yeah this retails
for $37 that is on the higher side and
it is a very well-rounded product but I
also feel like you only need this if you
love makeup and you love playing around
with different techniques and different
formulas is this something that you need
in your life as a staple or to just have
in your kit wherever you go yeah and
especially not for $37 and a thin ass
bomb anyways let's move on to more fun
stuff let's move on to today's wouldn't
