Diaries makeup tutorial and this week um
the episode was insane I'm going to
focus on the makeup that Caroline wore
when she is a V you know and she she
kicks dings s I'm also I'm thinking
about doing the Vampire Diaries
unlike episode reviews on my second
channel like talked about the episode
what did we think of hit mo blah blah so
if you want that from me then just let
me know and I will start doing those so
yeah so if you want to know how to get
the makeup that Caroline wore when she
was a bad as a monkey then please keep
on watching
okay so the first thing you want to do
is apply a base to your lips to prepare
your eyes on creasing I used my michael
todd nude cream eyeshadow I always
thought it was a cream eyeshadow base
but it's just a cream eyeshadow it's
called nude and stays on the entire day
I love it and the second thing I'm going
to do is apply some and YX jumbo pencil
in milk just to make that colors the
smoky colors pop and just stay on and
pretty and the first thing we're going
to do is scrub a brush like this this is
like those pencil brushes and I'm going
to UM grab mixed and Mark and with that
color you're going to line your upper
lid so I'm going to start on the outer
corners right here and then work my way
in and the more you go away in the
thinner you wanna apply the shadow tuck
a little on your skin
until you have that and then I'm going
to take his big sister this is a bigger
sized one the same brand and back into
and mark and you want to make a rounded
crease shape because in the and like the
scene with you suck that scene you
really could see that her eyes were
really rounded so I'm just going to grab
that color and go around into my crease
go around then go further in till about
there and then you can make this outer
corner all fade and I'm pretty and nice
then I'm going to grab a 217 my neck and
in embarq again and then just blend
those edges a bit and then I'm going to
grab a 217 my Sigma which is a little
bit bigger and fluffier and I'm going to
grab quark I'm gonna grab quark which
that color and with that brush your
going over your crease to blend it out
so go right here and blend but keep that
shape round don't do weird stuff and
make it I don't know weird just make it
round then with that same brush I'm
going to take work on the sides of the
brush like that and then just blend
further into the lid this will give a
nice gradient effect Jenna really nice
shimmery ish lid and highlight so I'm
going to grab a 239 my Mac
and just just and that's going right
here on to about the half of the lid and
then again you can always take your
brushes and make everything dark again
then for my brow bone and inner corner
highlight I'm going to grab this color
right here this is by makeup studio and
I have like this wide but this is like
an off-white color so I'm going to grab
that I don't know the number of it but I
will put it on my website on the product
list I'm going to grab a 275 to apply it
with and just go on to your elbow and
apply that to the inner corner right
here and then because she had a little
bit of unlike shimmer this to the
highlight points I'm gonna grab this Ben
Nye pigment and this is called um LX one
ice LX my eyes I have no idea I got it
in my starter kit from the Academy I
grab some onto a brush and just put that
on your highest points of your brow bone
and blend it up and also put some on the
inner corners and work it onto the lid
just a little bit so in your corners and
the corners lid just a little bit 360
right now I'm going to grab a brush like
this and go into a black color I'm using
makeup studio again and just really
closely do the lash line make it black
I'm just going to grab a black I call
this one is my makeup studio as well
just line your waterline
mm and then with that same really thin
angled brush I'm going to go into carbon
first and really tightly just line it to
your lash line that's very that's very
fulfilling the verb so that's it for the
eye shadow I'm now going to apply some
mascara by makeup studio my new favorite
and from fakest video again I'm gonna
apply some medium-sized individual
lashes on this side I did about 6 this
because I wanted to believe pact lashes
um see ya around 6 of these and then I
will show you what is on my lips ok so
the lips you wanna on first apply some
lip erase like I always do and then I'm
going to grab this MAC lipstick in angel
thank you guys so much for watching I
hope you enjoyed this video
umm I love the second episode of season
2 of The Vampire Diaries maybe it can be
maybe it can be like I'm a girl maybe I
admit maybe I can be like a girly
werewolf or something
a blonde girly werewolf rah woof um but
I'm still not giving up on the whole
idea of me being um Lexi sister and
coming back for revenge and then
fighting and then finding love with a
really hot vampire or something like
that so anyways thank you guys for
