Diaries book and today is again
Katherine um I think Katherine is my
most favorite person person per ton let
me put my Katherine jacket on before we
start so today we're doing the look of
Katherine at the masquerade ball and
this episode was freakin insane I loved
it and what I loved was Katherine's
makeup she had like this waned outer
crease and red lips which suits Nina
Dobrev amazing for this new effect in
Corel VideoStudio watch if you want to
see how I did this look then please keep
on watching and I love you and bye
so the first thing you want to do in
I steal is to prepare your eyes from
creasing um I use my Michael taught nude
eye cream shadow so the first thing
we're going to do is grab a light uh why
dish a shadow I'm going to grab my fees
are pellet and grip that white color and
apply that to the inner 2/3 of the lid
now we're going to take max quark and
with the same brush just the other side
we're going to go into that eye shadow
and we're going to blend this with the
light color till like half of the lid so
we're going to apply to the outer
corners of the lid and match it up and
blend I'm going to take a sigma 219 and
mystery i shadow by mac and we're going
to make the like cut crease with this so
like the darkest part of the eye look so
what you want to do is follow your lower
lash line up so we're going up up up up
and stop from the outer point of that
line go into the crease like that and
then go as far in as you like I like to
go in a little bit more because I have a
big nose and that makes it look smaller
and this is a cut crease fill it up and
make it nicer and prettier and
appropriate for a ball masquerade ball
not the other balls blendy outer corners
with the cork now I'm on the graph a
Sigma 217 and just go in the same color
and make it a nice blend
now with a MEK 217 go in any black color
I'm gonna grab the black from the piece
of art palette and I'm just going to
darken up the outer corners right here
now with an angled brush like this I'm
going to go into mystery again and this
is going on the lower lash line and you
want to meet it up with the corners you
know keep it really sharp and small so
don't smoke it down the same brush I'm
going to go into cork and that is going
on the middle of the lid and then also
in that white or color again what I'm
going to do now is grab my elements got
precision inked in black and put that
just on the line of my lash line like
that then on my waterline to open up the
eyes of it I'm going to grab a mixed
chroma graphic pencil in NW 25 and NC 30
second random then for mascara I'm gonna
grab L'Oreal voluminous carbon block six
time for the lips and Catherine or am a
Xing rat lips like damn the color looks
good so I'm going to give three options
for a lipstick so you can choose whether
you want Oh like a expensive lipstick
inexpensive and all the stuff option
number one is Rimmel London's 230 red
fever
amazing red color look amazing second
choice is NYX Snow White even amazing
art and then if you want a really bright
red lip you can grab Mac's
rep Mac red now because Katherine Nina
Dobrev is so much more 10 and another
different skin tone color than me um
where was I going with this I'm gonna go
with a little bit of
darker red because if I apply the really
really bright reds I'll look like a
clown so I'm going to go with these snow
white from NYX
and then when you've applied Snow White
to your lips you're done lately a lot of
you wanted to know what I'm wearing on
my cheeks because I never tell you as a
contour I use a Meg blotting powder in
deep dark then as a blush she had a kind
of orangey peachy blush I use the Melba
by Mac as well
and then also by Mac this is from the
champale collection this is judge'll of
me gonna say they're good my complete
says look from The Vampire Diaries with
Katherine at the masquerade ball this
was one of my favorite episodes ever of
The Vampire Diaries and um yes we're
finally going to do it question of this
video
