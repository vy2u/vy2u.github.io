for the tutorial
so the first thing you of course want to
do is apply a base to your eyelids to
prevent them from creasing
I mean vampires are bloody and creepy
and low but they don't have creased
eyelids I love him like at one side I'm
my hello game I'm going to kill you
today no the other side I'm like the
first caller we're going to use is Swiss
chocolate and it's not like your typical
brown it's a really reddish a medium to
dark brown and this is perfect for like
the under color of this look so um it's
a little bit too light so I'm going to
take my 239 my Mac and right next to it
is carbon and I'm going to match the two
of them together and then this is going
all over your lid go all the way in and
you can case them more and work it out
and then go back on top just put on your
lid now I'm going to take a 226 by Sigma
and I'm going to go into you Swiss
chocolate only and this color is going
to be blended all up into freezing all
up to right here as you can see so we're
just going to take the brush and blend
it into the crease and go high up with
this go all the way into here as well
and go up go up go up go up now I'm
going to take carbon the black color
only and I'm gonna darken the lid up
just make a really deep and dark so I'm
going to grab carbon on the 226th and
blend it in now for my brow bone
highlight I'm just going to take a MSF a
mineralized skinfinish by Mac called
light medium I'm going to grab my 275 by
Sigma I'm just gonna go on to my brow
bone blend it down and go inwards and
make that brownish color nice and
blended you can just take Swiss
chocolate and blend it everywhere you
like and just reopen safai that color I
also like to take this color right here
this is from I'm like I don't know how
many years about the college cherry
collection and this is called chestnut
and it's like a reddish color I'm just
gonna go over it lightly to make it a
little bit more redder you don't have to
do this at all but I just like it pretty
low really we're going crazy when they
turn into vampires you see like all
these veins and stuff and I love it so
I'm gonna grab my two 14 by Sigma and
then go into again Swiss chocolate and
this is going to be blended all along my
lower lash line so you're gonna start
right here you go
all the way in and you're going to
include tear ducts as well and it's
going to be a hell of a blending smoking
as hottes like to take it to 19 and go
and switch chocolate again and blend it
down a whole wad now I like to make that
even darker and smokier and like that so
I'm going to take carbon that color to
black and just
smoking even more make it dark and bad
I'm gonna kill you and bite you in and
again go all the way
I like to take that 2:19 again and take
some of that carbon and merge it down
now it's time to do like the veins that
appear when they turn into a vampire or
get mad and it turn into a vampire as
well so I'm going to go back into Swiss
chocolate and I'm going to take a 210
and this is a eyeliner brush by Sigma I
will put a link to Sigma into bottom bar
and I'm going to make that brush wet so
I'm just going to take eyedrops I drops
you know like the eyes you're going to
UM make the brush wet but not soaking
wet you want to work it back and forth
on your hands to make it damp and then
take a corner of the shadow just don't
take the middle or something just take a
corner with the shadow and then with
that brush make veins under your eyes
and really don't be too neat with this
step because it's not like
I do have to say that it is nicer when
you make them kind of connected in a way
like they come out of each other or
something
those are mine just play around with
them don't be too knee and just place
them now I'm just going to take that 217
by Mac again and go back into Swiss
chocolate and sweet chestnut and make
this inner corner of your like eye
reddish with those colors but I'm not
going to do is apply some eyeliner to my
waterline to make it even blacker I'm
gonna use flu I'm by Mac and black track
and some Scarah this is a volume million
lashes by L'Oreal um yeah Fripp's um I
want to keep things really my trouble
again in the Vampire Diaries when they
turn into vampires it's not like they
get like bright pink lips or something
no they're just really neutral but kind
of toned down
so what I'm gonna do is get my I'm just
like grabbing it I'm just gonna grab a
my Mac a lip erase this is a great great
product it's like a lip erase lip balm
it's just like a lip balm that raises
your lip color you use concealer and
stuff up for an out I'm gonna use that
just kind of take my ring finger and um
you does lips out if you want you can
apply some crazy ass contacts but I'm
not going to today I have white ones but
I'm not going to apply them because in
the Vampire Diaries they do not have
white eyes when they turn into vampires
you're just getting really creepy veins
and stuff that's all so that completes
the second installment for my the
Vampire Diaries makeup series I'm going
