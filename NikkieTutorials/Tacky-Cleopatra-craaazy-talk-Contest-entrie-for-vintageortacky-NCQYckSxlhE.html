the contest for vintage or tacky Korra I
love you honey you knew that but um I'm
entering her a contest which is super
fun you can do a vintage look a tacky
look or both and win the grand prize and
I'm totally out for winning the grand
prize so I'm doing but local looks today
this is my vintage look
and this is my tacky look but for now
we're going back to my vintage look I'm
going to explain everything about my
vintage look right there and then we
will go back to this look and then I
will explain everything about my tacky
look so enjoy the vintage look I was
inspired by um Egypt and Cleopatra I
loved Cleopatra she is so gorgeous in
most of the movies I saw that that is
why the black liner and the gold and
everything I kind of saw that she wasn't
always happy to be the Queen so that's
why it made this on black tear with
onion a ransom for her beautiness and
yes that's a long story for this look
but that is basically a gold and black
eyes with a tear of unhappiness in her
life so that is it for my vintage look
and now we are going to my tacky look
oh yeah I just not knock over the entire
gold glitter bottle of OCC oh so for my
tacky look um I was inspired by
self-esteem
um I think when you're tacky you are all
about yourself
and you are trying to get people to look
at you so you have pride booming
glittery eyes with bright booming purple
lips and fake hair and bring it until
you die but that is basically it what is
tacky to me um you can wear this look
with purple lips or you can wear it with
neat lips like this and personally you
know I love my new lip so like this I
could go out into the club
and with the lights on me I could
sparkle the night away and I just really
like the new clips with it but for the
extra drama I like the purple better
again I hoped you liked this two looks
um I really like this vintage look right
here so if you have any questions leave
them in the comments section um please
comment and subscribe
wish me luck for this contest and Cora
you're beautiful I totally love you as a
girl and and as a person as well and I
just love this contest so wish me luck
and thanks for watching
I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
