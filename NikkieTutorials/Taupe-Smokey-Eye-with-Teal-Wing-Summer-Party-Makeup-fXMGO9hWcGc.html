tutorial on this summer party look I
recently received the pure minerals
double eagle eyeliner and I felt so
inspired to create a look around it
because this color is my latest
obsession it's like this teal blue green
shebang yeah I wanted to do something
with this color right here and then make
it appropriate for like a summer party I
came up with this the lips are on
another level but you could totally go
for a new lip or a pink lip or a red lip
or whatever lip you want with this so
yeah that's it if you want to know how
to get this makeup look right here then
please keep on watching so the first
thing I'll be doing is applying a base
to my eyelids to prevent everything from
creasing and for this I'm using my Mac
soft ochre Paint Pot and I'm using a
zueva one-four-two brush for this for
the crease I'm taking this morphe 35 t
neutral palette and I'll be using these
two colors right here and with a morphe
m4 one - I'm just defining my crease now
going in the morphe 35c and i'm taking
this color right here and with a morphe
m4 33 I'm just defining the outer
corners for the little be going in with
this Natasha de Nonna I shadow palette
in number 9 and I'm taking this color
right here and this is called industrial
and with a morphe m4 22 I'm just
applying this all over the lid and then
dampening that brush and then using the
same eyeshadow but damp and what that
will do is just intensify the sheen and
metallic nosov that shadow even more for
the lower lash line I'm going in with
that same dark warm brown from the
morphe palette and with a morphe Mb 18
brush I'm just defining my lower lash
line
smoking it out then for the inner
portion of the lower lashline I'm taking
this color right here and this is also
from the morphe 35c pellet and with a
morphe 36 i'm just applying this to the
inner corners and then going back in
with a dark brown color and blending it
with the blue for a pop of shimmer on
the inner corners I'm again taking that
Natasha de Nona eyes shadow palette in
number 9 and taking this color right
here and this is called aluminum and
with a morphe m3 26 I'm just popping
that on the inner corners the fur liner
I'm going to use this amazing meal liner
that I got from pure minerals and this
is coffee double ego dual and did
eyeliner and this is in the color
Queensland and what I love most about
this is that one side is your regular
pencil so this can go inside the eye or
on the lower lash line but on the other
side it has a liquid liner so for my
liner today I'll be using Queensland by
pur minerals I did this color so much
then to still see that amazing color on
the lid
I'm just whisking this liner out about
half way in and then go ahead and fill
in
oh my goodness I'm obsessed okay I'm now
going to switch over to the actual
pencil side of this eyeliner and this is
going on my waterline so that's it for
the eye shadows I'm now going to move on
to lashes the lashes today are by Lena
lashes and this is the bridal collection
and today I'll be using these flashes
right here and these are called gorgeous
and it quick heads up if you use the
code nikkietutorials over at lena lashes
at check outs you will get a 50%
discount code not 1550 so enjoy and then
to perfectly coat your lower lashes with
mascara
I'm taking my mascara and my zueva 3:22
brow line brush and with this I'm taking
the mascara and coating it on top of my
lashes for the cheeks of first going to
contour and today I'm going to use
something new this is by Inglot and they
have their freedom system palette and
you can choose your own shades so I'm
going to contour today using a mixture
of these two right here yes and the
brush I'll be using for this is the
morphe efore brush then also a little
bit on the jaw line cuz I need it then
to bronze up my face I'm taking this
Tarte Park F Princess bronzer right here
I take this one because it makes me look
bronze but perfect for a light fair skin
it's a really nice bronzer a little bit
on the forehead and with this I also
kind of contour my forehead a little bit
I kind of want to shrink it with it for
blush i'll be using golden hide by
Guerlain goddamn I love this blush for a
highlighter today I'm taking this pur
minerals illuminating powder it's a
highlighter and this is called afterglow
oh hello hello Oh God
Kipps bah and of course tip of the nose
then not to take away any powder I'm
going in with my mac fix+ and just
spritzing my says and I always block my
eyes because I'm scared it will like
bleed my eyeliner or something so I just
always pluck my eyes for lipstick today
I'm going to go in with neon coral
liquid lipstick by Thomas ah superbly
hills I was contemplating whether I
should go for something bright like this
one or my go-to favorite nude combo but
it's completely up to you if you want
all the attention on your eyes cuz I
really love this eye look then go ahead
and put your new lipstick all but if you
want it to be more of a summer party
vibe I should go for a brighter color
and then mixing in a little bit of a
retro coral and that guy's concludes
