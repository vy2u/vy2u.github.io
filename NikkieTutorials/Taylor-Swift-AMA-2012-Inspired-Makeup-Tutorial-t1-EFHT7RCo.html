say this but this is actually going to
be the first time I'm going to do a
Taylor Swift inspired tutorial a couple
of weeks ago were the American Music
Awards 2012 and one person that really
stood out to me was Taylor Swift she was
absolutely gorgeous
her dress was divine her makeup was
perfection and I feel like Taylor Swift
is sort of like America's Sweetheart I
kind of feel like Taylor could date a
hundred men in a row and America would
still be sort of they basically wouldn't
give a crap because it's Taylor Swift so
she could just never mind
and yesterday I'm going to do the Taylor
Swift AMAs 2012 look and it's super glam
and I really really like it and I hope
you guys like it as well so uh keep on
watching okay it's always first things
first I'm going to prime my eyelids and
I'm gonna do that with my neck soft
ochre Paint Pot you didn't see that one
coming did you
I totally changed that intro I first got
to define my crease a little bit easing
next quirk I shadow
I'm just mainly focusing on the outer
part start defining and creating depth
and then slightly go in I'm going to
darken the outer part of my crease a
little bit with Mac's corduroy eyeshadow
and this is mainly stating on the outer
part of the crease sort of blending
towards the middle and up taking
corduroy only I'm going to define the
very outer third of my lower lash line
and just really tiny just give it a
little bit of shadow and then bring it
out towards the crease and then connect
it to the crease as well for the lid I'm
going to use Mac's wood winged eye
shadow and this seriously looks good on
anyone and just Pat that all over I'm
going to darken my outer crease up a
little bit more using that corduroy
again just a teeny tiny bit then I'm
quickly gonna highlight my brow bone
using Mac's
shroom and I'm going to highlight my
inner corners using shroom and Blanc
type Blanc drop instead ah I keep draw
ah ha ha ha hmm for that bottom lash
line goodness I'm going to use Mac's
amber lights eyeshadow and this is
applied very closely to the lash line
and all the way in and this will give it
such an amazing sort of pop this really
makes it look so unique and fun ok for
my waterline I'm using my trusty old Ben
9 utilize your cream crayon alight and
b2 and for the eyeliner I'm using my Mac
black track fluid line and the brushin
we'll be using for my eyeliner is my
physio number twenty two brush and you
just want to make a really nice thick
winged eyeliner go about us thick as you
want I'm gonna go quite thick because on
the pictures that I saw off Taylor you
couldn't really see her lid color
anymore when she was looking straight
ahead so that kind of indicates that her
liner was quite thick so make a thick
winged liner
and then you sort of have a really nice
thick liner like this okay now I'm just
going to put on my she sayd oh perfect
mascara defining volume and this looks
screams lashes I'm just gonna use the
Miss adoro 7 4 7 m okay for the cheeks
normally I would say start off by
contouring with my NYX blush in taupe
and then warm up my face with the
illamasqua blush in disobey I'm going to
change it up a little tiny bit today I'm
going to mix the two together instead of
packing them on top of each other I'm
going to mix them together so I'm
contouring and blending it out to warm
up my face and your temples as well for
blushing on a used a makeup studio
Lumiere blushes in true pink and elegant
beige and put it really sort of in the
center of your cheeks and quite high up
you really want to look blushy and to
give myself the beautiful Hollywood glow
I'm going to use my soft and gentle
mineralized skinfinish by Mac after
lipstick I first going to dab on a
little bit of Kat Von D paint it love
lipstick in Agatha and then blend it in
with your fingers and then on top a
little bit of NARS Turkish delight lip
gloss and that guys completes my Taylor
Swift at the American Music Awards 2012
