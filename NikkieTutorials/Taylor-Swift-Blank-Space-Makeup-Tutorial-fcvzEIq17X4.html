requests to do a tutorial inspired by
Taylor Swift's new music video blank
space and well the first couple of times
I watch that music video all I could pay
attention to was Sean oh so after
watching the video for about 50 times I
realized that the makeup was really
pretty and I decided to finally today do
a tutorial on my favorite look from the
video which is where she's like twisting
and forking that Apple and she's working
the hell out of pet Apple and and the
Apple even spins on her finger and I was
like is this photoshopped or how did
they do this oh my god anyways if you
want to know how to get this a very
pretty Taylor Swift blank space music
video inspired makeup look then please
stay tuned and I also want to kind of
tell I guess that this is one of those
perfect Christmas looks so here you go
alright guys so the first product I'm
starting off with is by Tarte and it's
the clean slate
timeless smoothing primer oh I really
should stop making my face before I film
videos okay so I'm just going to start
rubbing this all over okay then for
foundation gonna mix two together I'm
using the l'oreal true match in n1 and
my hello flawless foundation by benefit
in i'm pure for sure ivory and this mix
the do dole is first going on to the
skin and then with my Sigma f80 brush
I'm going to start buffing this in
okay now I'm taking my mac prolongwear
concealer in NC 15 and I am applying
this everywhere
and I'm buffing my concealer in with my
Sigma f-86 and I'll be using this brush
to buffing my concealer for all the
places that is not underneath my eyes
because I'll be using my micro mini
Beauty Blender the jig for that and I'm
now setting my under eye area using
makeup Studios translucent powder in
number one okay I'm not going to do my
brows and one eye off-camera and then it
will be back for eyes as always up first
starting off with my Mac soft ochre
Paint Pot to keep my eyeshadows from
creasing and just to make the colors pop
and just make everything look good
really the first I should I'll be using
is stone by anastasia beverly hills and
this will be my transition color and i'm
applying stone right in my crease and
i'm making soft windshield wiper motions
to get it in there and then the more
definition I build the further I go up
with it to give myself some darkness
higher up and then I'm going to tilt the
brush like this and kind of wing it out
at the side now going in the bombs meet
matte nude eyeshadow palette and I'm
taking matte Abdul and also taking
makeup geek eyeshadow and stealth
where they zueva 227 at first focusing
it on the outer part of my eyes and then
slowly start building it into the crease
also so you kind of want to look down
with your eyes and brush it on those
sides they get a nice outer corner here
and then tilt that brush up again and go
in the crease then once most of that is
on I take that brush and drag that
bluish gray color into the inner part of
my crease now taking max shaping powder
and emphasize and I'm highlighting my
inner corners with this and also kind of
defining my nose line it's
some morph that same powder and
highlight my brow bone and I was also
the time to perfect that crease shape so
I like having this part here a little
bit more sharp so just with my
highlighting shade right next to it to
sharpen it up the for the lid I'm still
using that shaping powder in emphasized
by Mac and this is going on to my lids
and I blend it towards the blue gray
color
okay so onto the eyeliner I'm using my
Kat Von D tattoo liner in trooper for
this I already make this sign right here
you kind of want to aim for the end of
your eyebrow and then from there drag it
all the way to the inner corners and
fill in
for the lower lashline i'm again taking
those two creased colors and I'm going
to start smudging this in to the roots
of my lower lashes you kind of want to
connect it to that eyeliner here you
don't kind of want to do it you just
want to do that then I work my way
towards the inner corner like a bow then
switching over to stone I shadow by
unsteady Ripley Hills and going even
further to the inner corner and then all
I'm going to do now to complete the look
is use my hourglass mechanical gel liner
in 1.5 millimeter obsidian and I'm going
to tightline with this all I'm gonna do
now is curl my lashes and apply mascara
and finish up with falsies and today I'm
using the Ardell whispies I'm contouring
today using my blush in taupe by NYX I
lost my hair and I should have by
Illamasqua I have no idea where it went
so I'm kind of lost now because what do
I do with that heroine well you've
grabbed hope by NYX Taylor did have a
lovely warm glow to her face so I'm
using my Mac mineralize skinfinish and
give me son - runs up my face even more
then for blush I'm going to use this
Tarte Amazonian clay 12-hour blush in
celebrated and this just gives the
softest hint of color it's such a
stunning shade because in the pot you're
like oh that doesn't really do much and
then once you put it on it just
transforms your cheeks and this really
softly touched softly flushed dream I
like I dig and then from the Tarte Park
F Princess palette cheek palette I'm
taking the highlighter shade right here
and with this I am highlighting my
cheekbones today and I love this because
it's super soft and beautiful I mean
what glow isn't beautiful I mean I think
everyone looked good with a little bit
of a shiny Prada
on the cheeks because it makes the white
glowy for lips you want to go red and a
little bit glossy so first I'm lining my
lips using my la girl endless a
semi-permanent Auto lip liner jeez
Louise and true red oh my god are you
kidding me it broke on me twice already
stop it stop breaking on me I cut this
lip liner let's get very trouble now I'm
taking my Too Faced and melted liquefied
long-wear lipstick in melted rouille and
this is great because it already has
that glossy finish to it so I won't
really have to go in with a different
gloss afterwards
and that guy's concludes this very
pretty Taylor Swift blank space music
