so if you would like to know how to get
this Taylor look right here then please
keep on watching as always the first
thing I'll be going in with is
manipulate balm sensitive after getting
a lot of questions whether I use
sensitive or normal I use sensitive for
foundation I'm going to use my trusty
old combo of next Studio Fix fluid and
kokand o aqua foundation and I'm just
buffing this in using my Sigma s 88
for concealer max Pro Longwear I bought
a new one and first this is going
underneath my eyes mechanics triangle to
highlight and I'm going to follow
through and move towards underneath my
nose and my cupids bow and then I'm
going to buff it in using my Real
Techniques sponge and setting that with
powder to prevent it from creasing the
first thing I'm going to do is apply a
base to my eyelids to prevent everything
from creasing and I'm using my Mac soft
ochre Paint Pot for the crease of first
going in with these away by Coco blend
pellet and I'm taking the color
substitute for love and I'm applying
this straight to my crease using a sigma
e35 and this will be my transition color
and then also you want to slightly wing
that up and out then deepening that
using makeup geek smoke up just start
defining your crease with this a little
bit more and for this I'm using a Mac
217 for the lid I'll take subtle blend
and darkening that using beans our
whites just on the lash line start
darkening that up for the lower lash
line and first going in with these two
colors in the middle and you want to
apply these from inner to outer corner
now it's time to focus on that gorgeous
wing so for this I'll be first outlining
my wing using my Keaveney woods black
background Keaveney tattoo liner in
trooper the first I'm just going to go
ahead and create that inner corner flick
and once you've got that it's time to
create that big a swing and I'm using my
NYC black liquid liner to fill this all
in now with a black eye shadow I'm going
to deepen up the lower lash line and
lastly off-camera I'll be applying a
black hole just to my waterline actually
no let's just add a little bit more
black to the crease to just deepen it up
a little bit more
For Lashes today I'll be using Lena
lashes in Claudia for cheeks is always
the first going to contour using my Kat
Von D shade and light palette this is
such a strong look that it just needs
contouring to bronze up my face I'm
taking the bronzer from this contouring
palette by Tarte this is the park of
princess contour palette and as I said
I'm taking the bronzer for blush I'm
using the girl a golden high blush
mary-lou manizer broke so I'm going in
