tutorial inspired by Taylor Swift's new
music video wildest dreams which is so
good I just love the music video and I
recently got this lipstick by fusion
Beauty called Moulin Rouge which I
wanted to do a red lip look with this
for so long now so this was the perfect
time to do it with so yeah today this is
going on my lips and were inspired by
Taylor Swift's wildest dreams so yeah if
you would like to know how to get this
super nice pinup e glam makeup look then
keep on watching the first thing I'm
going to do for this look is prime with
my Nivea men aftershave balm I'm not
even going to talk why just look any
other video I've done before and I will
tell you and then following through
using my Smashbox photo finish primer
water for foundation you want something
super flawless and porcelain because
Taylor's look was super perfected and
flawless so for foundation today I'm
going to use the aqua foundation by
Cogan doe at first putting this on with
my tweezer men contour foundation brush
and just buffing it in and I'm covering
my lips so that later on the red
lipstick will look hella good for
concealer I'm going to use my favorite
it cosmetics bye bye under-eye in the
color light
and we're going for flawless so I say if
you think you need a little bit more
concealer go for it
nice and perfect now I'm gonna bake my
under-eye area to prevent everything
from creasing quickly to my brows a
little back so since ellipse for such a
key feature of the look I thought why
not start with lips today and then build
on to the eyes if we're to look I'm
going to use this fusion Beauty lipstick
in Moulin Rouge it's actually the fusion
beauty lip fusion plump and shine
lipstick in Moulin Rouge and I got
recommended this by a friend and she
told me it has plumping technology to
boost your lips and give it a little bit
more volume you know I'm all about that
it has a bunch of amazing ingredients
that just makes your lips look kind of
plump and fuller and I like that and I
have a 20% discount code on all fusion
beauty products so click the link down
below to get 20% off so I'm going to be
applying this first and then build on to
the look Taylor definitely had that
classic lip shape going on so you want
to be the highest here and then kind of
swoop down here to give that really nice
heart shape not a heart shape give that
really classic shape
so instantly do you see how it has that
little curve right here that is what you
want to follow that gives it that really
classic vintage touch now fill in
straight from the bullet so as I'm
applying it straight from the bullet I
definitely feel a slight very soft
tingle and that must be the ingredients
that make it a little bit more plumping
and volumizing just like this and now
let's focus on the eyes for eyes the
first thing I'm going to do is primum
using my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot then
using a zueva concealer buffer brush to
buff it in now for my crease up to my
brow bone I'm going to set everything
with a flesh-colored I mean boom colored
eyeshadow and this will help blend out
that crease color later on for the
crease I'm going in these Sela eyes are
the window shadow palette in mind and
for that I'll be using this color right
here plus the color at the top and I'm
going to slightly cut the crease with
this so with my makeup geek defined
crease brush I'm looking straight
forward and applying the shadow right
above my crease so that when I look
straight forward you can still see it
and then at the outer portion you want
to softly wing it out then from the
outer corner bringing that up to that
wing and blend the two together then
with a morphe and for 33 I'm slightly
blending that out then slowly but surely
start defining that cut crease soft cut
crease more and more using the same
colors for the lid I'm going to take
this Natasha de Nona eyeshadow in cream
and this is going on to my lid and also
softly cutting that crease even more
using that color
right up to the crease and sort of cut
it even more and also putting this on
the inner corners for the lower lash
item again using that seal appellate and
I'm using this color right here and this
color right here and really closely to
the lower lash line start bringing in
that shadow and then to really grout the
eyes and give it that vintage II feel
you want to apply a small flick of
eyeliner just on the outer corners and
keep it really nice and cute I'm using
my Kat Von D tattoo liner in trooper for
this
now quickly apply some mascara and
falsies if it takes you want to keep
everything very porcelain e very crisp
very clean very vintage so I'm going to
contour very softly using my bubbie
brown eyeshadow in wheat and my Mac 137
brushed really lightly barely any and
I'm also quickly going to do my nose
ever blush you want to go for something
super bright and pink just get that
vintage pinup you look Cohen if for this
I'm going to use Mac's Paint ro peach
and then a tiny bit just a tiny bit of
glow using the NYX prismatic eyeshadow
in Girl Talk and some of the tip of the
nose
now quickly doused your face and fix+
and the look is done and that guys
