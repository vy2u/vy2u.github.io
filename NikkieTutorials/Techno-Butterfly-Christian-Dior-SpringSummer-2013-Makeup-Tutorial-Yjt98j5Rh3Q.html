because I'm included in one of YouTube's
biggest collabs featuring let me get my
list because I am gonna forget people in
this collab are Pixie woo myself
Dustin hunter Jordan Liberty Smashing
Beauty Pacheco's inna karlie Mosley
lauren luke from panacea 81 and Julia
craft this collab is going to be all
about the makeup from a designer show or
like a campaign or whatever we all had
to do a look inspired by a designer
makeup and if there's one designer
makeup I've been wanting to do for ages
now it's the techno butterfly look from
pepper grass at the Dior spring/summer
2013 a show and this by Pat McGrath
called techno butterfly look has been in
my inspiration folder for so long and
I've been always wanting to do this look
so when I was invited for this collab I
was like okay I know exactly what look I
have to do it's the techno butterfly and
I definitely want you guys to check out
all the other girls in this amazing
collab so I will put all the links to
the videos in the infobox below plus I
will have a separate blog post featuring
all the videos from all the
collaborating that a word now and just
all the videos are going to be in the
blog post so you can watch one by one
but without any further ado I can't wait
to show you the techno butterfly look
inspired by Pat McGrath at the Dior 2013
spring/summer show alright so the first
thing I want to do for this look is
apply a luminous radiant base and for
this up using my L'Oreal Lumi magique
pure light primer and this will really
get that glow going for you because it
has a lot of shiny particles in it which
I think look very pretty because it
makes you look very glowy and very
radiant and
luminous but sometimes it can be a
little bit too much so be careful with
it for foundation today I chose my face
and body by Mac and this is c1 and then
once that's on I want to give it a
little bit more coverage here and there
and for that I'll be going for my Bobbi
Brown Skin Foundation stick in Xero
porcelain but first say some body and as
usual I'm applying this with my makeup
geek stippling foundation brush
and that combination makes your skin
look super natural and perfect but
without going too far with it plus I
love that glow that face and body gives
you to further conceal I'm going to use
my Mac Pro Longwear NC 15 as always and
as always blending that in with my Sigma
f80 6 ok now I'm going to set my face
loosely so not too much powder we want
to keep that face of body glow going on
I'm gonna take my Chanel natural is
finished powder and I'm a 20 Claire for
that and then I'm just gonna do brows I
know the brows and this look are a
little bit more natural so I'm gonna try
plus I'm gonna do one eye off-camera and
then I will be back okay so for eyes the
first thing what it did was prime my
eyelids using my soft ochre Paint Pot by
Mac and the first eyeshadow be using is
wisteria by makeup geek and I'm gonna
pop with Syria on my lid and with this
I'm going to build the shape that I want
for this look gorgeous look what I
notice is that they went straight into
the inner corner meeting up to the nose
bridge
oh no purple on my nose so to kind of
went straight out and then straight up
so it sort of becomes a square on the
inner corner of your eye so I'm gonna
take this up and then from there go in
my crease again and right now it looks
absolutely horrendous I know but it
works out in the end
so I took a more wisteria and blending
that up till the crease on this very
inner part here then with an angled
brush I'm going to determine where I
want the outer wing to go to and you
want to match them pretty good I'm just
going to go a little bit more flat than
following the waterline and same thing
for that outer part here you kind of
want to drag it straight out
that I know shocking you wouldn't want
to do this on a day-to-day basis but for
now you want to I am going to fill that
entire space up and then for that outer
part you kind of want to flick it out
softly so kind of blends into nothing
now with a blending brush I'm going to
work on diffusing the edges and making
them a little bit softer and also going
a little bit higher up but you still
want to keep that sort of square shape
and for the inner corner here I like to
flick it on to the nose bridge and
softly flick it up to the beginning of
my brow really take that color and flick
it onto the side of your nose and up to
your brow and then for that outer corner
here just diffuse and soften up the
edges a bit you also in the pop that
color on the very inner corner so I'm
just going to add that right there and
then connect to that shape to that
square here taking a little bit of sugar
pills poison plum and whip this I'm
going to add some depth on that inner
corner and just you know kind of overall
just everywhere then for a slight touch
of blue I'm gonna go with Illamasqua
imagined and lightly dust that over the
lid then I wanted the slightest bit of
sparkle on the lip because I'm keeping
the lid bare and for this I'm going to
take my makeup studio dual effects in
shine and I'm just taking a really tiny
bit and popping this onto the middle of
my lid and then blending up to the
crease then you want to wipe the brush
off and kind of soften this up a bit a
little bit just like that now it's time
for the showstopper of the look the
crystals I picked three colors that I'll
be using today and I got them at bay
stage in amsterdam backstage and Amster
themselves so many amazingly coloured
swarovski crystals and they have them in
different sizes so I wanted a medium
sized green oil one so I picked this one
I also picked this really small green
one it's the same color as that bigger
one and then the same size as that green
but just in a crystal pinky color and
the shape you want to follow for this
look is put some smaller ones here on
the very inner corner then surround your
crease with the bigger ones and then
blow out with the smaller ones again and
then some bigger ones mixed into that
but you just want to keep the biggest
ones in your crease the smallest ones on
the in corners and blow up with that as
well
and what I'm going to use to make the
stick is my duo eyelash at youth oh and
then a very neat trick that I picked up
is with a q-tip you want to wet it and
then once you press it onto the crystal
they actually stick on to the q-tip and
you can just pop it on to the glue and
now just with the q-tip and the crystal
place it where you want to place it
so this is something you should be
having at the end I'm just gonna double
tap them again to secure them what I'm
going to do is really carefully curl my
lashes and add a little bit of mascara
this is my waterproof 3d extra black by
Omega Studio and just on the top lashes
because you want the bottom to be really
clean and bare and then the butterfly
techno butterfly wing eyes are completed
I guess so for shakes do you want to
keep everything really clean and healthy
I'm gonna however do some contouring
because I think my face doesn't look
complete without some contouring so I'm
gonna do that and today I'll be using my
Illamasqua eyeshadow in heroine then for
blush I want to use a new product that
just came in today this is the hourglass
a lighting blush in dim infusion and
I've been loving this product for
forever so I'm so excited to use it
today so I'm just gonna take a little
bit and pop this on the apples of my
cheeks and oh my gosh
it's such a healthy glow from within
color I love this and then for a
highlighter today I want to go for the
Becca shimmering skin Perfector in pearl
and on top of that a little bit of the
bomb's mary loumanizer so first gonna
take the Becca one with my finger and
slightly tap that on where I want to
highlight I also want a little bit on my
nose Cupid's bow and chin
and then as I said with the bombs
mary-lou manizer and a fan brush I'm
just going to take a little bit and
slightly dust this over that for lips
you want to go for a really nice
flattering nude with a little bit of
gloss so what I'm going to do is just
take out this entire color using a
little bit of Mac's myth I just want it
to be super nude now with my finger I'm
going to tap a lot off then I'm going to
take a little bit of the hourglass femme
nude nude number one lipstick and just
to add a little bit of color into it and
I do definitely want that Cupid's bow
highlights we're really stark and
intense so I'm going back with my the
balm mary lou manizer and my fan brush
and just going over one more time or
just want that to be really intense and
then for a gloss I'm going with a little
bit of my color your smile whitening
lightening lip gloss in buttercream just
a little bit
