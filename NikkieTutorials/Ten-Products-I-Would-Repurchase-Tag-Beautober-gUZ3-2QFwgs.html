you guys that in October I was going to
upload a video every other day and call
it Utah where well you guys hello and
welcome to bu Tober this month I'm gonna
post a video every other day and it's
gonna be so much fun it's gonna be a lot
of work but it's gonna be so much fun I
think I really I can't wait for like few
Tober so welcome to beauty over the
first video for Butte Ober is going to
be a tag and it's going to be the 10
products I would repurchase tags um this
has been going around for quite a while
now and I thought this will be so much
fun to open you tobert with so what this
tag is all about is sort of like you
lose your stuff and then you have to buy
ten of your ten of your most favorite
products to kind of build your kit again
what's up with these tags and US beauty
gurus losing everything every time like
with the 20 dollar makeup challenge
we lost stuff now with the 10 products
of repurchase tag
we lost stuff as beauty gurus are losing
everything nowadays I grab ten products
that I cannot live without and let's go
with number one the first is my makeup
for ever HD professional primer I
basically use this all the time I use it
on a long workdays where when my
foundation to look good all day I use it
before filming because these lines can
get really really hot I use it more than
my Mac prep and prime skin base massage
this is a way better job it keeps my
foundation on longer for about two or
three hours longer so um the first thing
I would definitely repurchase and can't
live without is my makeup forever
actually primer for my foundation
therefore foundation I was really torn
up between my Neutrogena Healthy Skin
Foundation and my Chanel perfection
Lumiere now I had to go for my Chanel
perfection Lumiere because quite frankly
I cannot get Neutrogena here in Holland
we don't have that here I always buy it
when I'm in the states or when a friend
from the states comes here and I would
repurchase it but I couldn't because I
had to buy a ticket for
like a thousand euros to New York or
something and that yeah so the second is
my Chanel perfection Lumiere foundation
in 12 beige rose it's a little bit too
pink for me but I can live with that I
can't live with that because the
perfection Lumiere is a little bit more
dry I didn't have to go with a powder
normally I would go crazy without a
powder but with the perfection Lumiere
I'm kind okay with it
I do definitely need my concealer and my
concealer of choice is my OCC obsessive
compulsive cosmetics concealer again I
think I could only choose like one color
so that will be I yellow one so yellow
one from the OCC concealers is my
favourite eye I talked about the Laura
Mercier secret camouflage concealers but
to be honest
OCC concealers are like so much better
they are pigmented creamy blend in like
a dream and it's seriously this is like
Photoshop in a jar therefore my eyebrows
because I basically don't have a lot of
hairs I have to fill them in I have to
you the one I chose is my Anastasia ash
blonde taupe brow powder duo I used a
darker color for the ends of my brow and
then fade in with the lighter color this
has been my Holy Grail brow product of
the year basically therefore iachino
this was coming this is my Mac soft
ochre Paint Pot I cannot live without
this I use this in every every single
video a couple of videos back and set up
my I'm gonna use myself Paint Pot as a
base to present the eyeshadows
increasing I said quite natural pain pot
because I use a different color and
people were like what you did not use
soft ochre what the hell are you stick
are you feeling okay is everything okay
with you did you get a check with the
doctor because I'm sure you're not okay
it's perfection for me it makes your
eyeshadow stay on all day long
imperfection and I just love love love
it it's such like a like a child to me
okey and the NYX is the eye shadow and
because you can't really choose like six
colors I went for my Holy Grail neutral
palette
this is my feast art number one
eyeshadow palette and this goes with me
everywhere to a shoot to it show to you
B Academy where I teach now um I use
this all the time basically when I don't
know what to wear I read this one I know
I don't use this allotting videos that's
because it's quite hard to get
international so I'm kind of like
staying away from it because not a lot
of people can get it so that's just 12 I
shadow and counts as one oh then I also
cannot live without my Ben Nye
neutralizer cream crayon and light and
p2 this wakes up your eyes in seconds
like when you apply it it's like ah oh
wait I often get questions from girls
like okay I was so sleepy what can I use
to make myself look more awake this baby
it's like heaven is is objecting like a
ray of light onto your eyes the mascara
I chose is makeup studio waterproof 3d
extra black again uses every day it is
the first mascara ever in my entire life
my 18 year life that it makes my lashes
look longer more volume eyes curlier
just better this is the first mascara
like I got this because my mom sells it
in a rep shop and she was like honey we
have to do mascaras trying now you know
you can have them seriously I opened
this up I looked at it and I was like so
I tried it on the day after and
literally my jaw dropped onto my desk
like I wasn't what is happening to my
lashes I got curled I got lengthened I
got volume eyes and I'm obsessed and in
love ever since this is my Holy Grail
mascara so the one and only mascara I
would ever ever ever repurchase is the
mascara waterproof beauty after like
product number nine and number ten are
for my lips the first is my Elizabeth
Arden 8 hour cream I sometimes wonder
what my life will be like without this I
would be such a depressed chapped lip
person it has a really distinctive smell
but it's bearable you get you soon like
after two days and it just it's like
it's like chapped lips put it on
beautiful lips it can put this on wounds
you can put this on you tattoos you can
put this on your eyelids you get that
really rock chic sort of like a glossy
stain your lips their product number 10
the absolutely last product on my list
is my lip erase by Mac and I use this
every time I go somewhere Basel clean
when I'm on the train or when I'm in the
car with my mom or when I'm going
somewhere my friends will know ask my
family as my friends they know
everywhere I go it's like you will see
me doing this I'm just dabbing my lip
erase on right after we drank something
right after it switched off it's like I
have to take my lip erase and I'm like a
lot of people at B Academy where I teach
they smoke and when everyone is smoking
I'm just sitting there and like with my
lip array something look Oh such a
beautiful weather I love it I've been
using this like for years now and I'm
obsessed with it so those were my ten
