back from my holiday in Tenerife I had
an amazing time I had so much fun with
my best friend I gained about 12 pounds
of cocktails McDonald's and pizza
it--and a bit I even have tan lines on
my body I never have talents on my mind
because I'm pill as a frickin paper so
I'm really proud of myself so today I am
here to show you everything that I
bought there I'm not showing you all the
clothes we just threw her in the washer
now because they were dirty I'm gonna
show you my new makeup and some other
stuff that arrived while I wasn't on at
home first of all just let me say that I
really really miss you I feel like a
part of me was gone and now it's back hi
it's a camera
No so let me tell you Tenerife is cheap
as hell
they don't have taxes and on top of not
having taxes they also give you
discounts on top of that price so that
is like amazing and I just broke my nail
and I didn't know that Tenerife was so
cheap so I went there kind of not
expecting to buy a lot of stuff and boy
was I wrong
brands like Chanel and YSL and perfume
and all that sort of stuff Lancome and I
was so cheap so I kind of splurge a bit
um I went on a lipstick Drive there it
was kind of sick I bought four along
come Rouge and love lipsticks and I
absolutely adore them the thing about
them is is when you see them in the
packaging they are matte but when you
swatch them they become this sort of
glossy beautiful shiny color and this is
this is number 377 N and this is so
pretty
I also got number 351 B and I love that
they're met in the packaging but once
you put them on your skin and get really
glossy but they're still pigmented gonna
stay on like a dream so I'm really
really look at this this is a purple
when you put it on it becomes is really
bright obnoxious like purpley pink and
then I also have number 340b and this is
so pretty for in summer and this is
the perfect coral color for summer so I
am absolutely loving the Lancome rouging
love lipsticks I think they have a
really interesting texture and I love
how they are so glossy and summaries at
simple airport I got the feet of feet
alumnus Evita Lumiere aqua foundation by
Chanel and this is in the lightest shade
this is number yep this is number of
this is number 10 days and this is I
believe their lightest color I have
nothing bad to say about it just that it
is a really small bottle for quite big
of money then I also kind of lipstick
from she now called the rich cocoa
powder d and this is what it looks like
I'm gonna put it next to the Lancome I
got this because of Lisa Eldridge I have
been on a Lisa Eldridge likes verge
lately um I got home from Tenerife and I
was so tired and I just blamed my
macbook to my TV and then I can watch
like the OP top on my TV Si and I was
bored and I was tired and I didn't
really have any like puffs to do
anything so I put on weight so Eldridge
and I just kind of soothe and relax and
enjoy her poise and her techniques and
her beautiful videos I am a huge fan if
you don't know where you should be
ashamed and by the way my voice is kind
of weird because I have been addicted to
nasal spray for seven months of my life
right now and I stopped using it in
tenerife like four or five days back and
my nose is all messed up so if I have a
really weird voice today is because of
my addiction to nasal spray which I
stopped now is really hard especially at
night and yes people actually do get a
duty to nasal spray it's very common
actually
how many updates in its video I want to
quickly mention that I bought two new
microphone and I slept my leg I want to
quickly mention that I bought two new
microphones for my videos one for on the
camera and that is going like right on
top right here and that is the zoom h1
and
for voiceovers for when I do like
fashion shoots and stuff for fashion
shots shots nut shoots shop through my
videos I always want to have that like
radio voice so I bought a blue Yeti
microphone so that is all coming in the
mail later this week and some tomorrow
so I can't wait to play with it and
finally have good sound and not hear the
fan of my macbook or the streets or my
dogs or my mom it's just me and my voice
only going on one channel I also fell in
love with their illusion to UM baked
eyeshadows these are like cream
eyeshadows that stay on like a dream and
they are so pretty I got two and my
favorite is the number 89 if this young
and I'm wearing that on my eyelids today
and it is such a beautiful like sparkly
gold gorgeousness and I also got number
86 and that is called that is wow that's
really hard this is called a bluey and
this is sort of like a dark red sort of
burgundy glittery color and then the
last thing pro chanel is this palette
and this is called the number 34 a cold
steel
my French sucks the a commotion y'all
call me I shadow quell it and this is
gorgeous
I've never owned a like high high-end
eyeshadow palette and this is my first
from Chanel and I love it from east and
along I got the to shake nap I don't
know if that was right but this is like
the most hyped up concealer highlighter
ever in the world everyone and their
mother is like oh my god so highlighting
concealer love it I used to shake that
on touch my kids so I got this in number
two and um so far it is pretty good but
you gotta have really good skin if you
have dark circles and you want to hide
this with it it's not gonna work it's
more of like a highlighting concealer
product it's not really concealing but
more highlighting I'm not the biggest
fan of it yet but it's coming
then I bought my favorite perfume in the
biggest size possible that they had
and that is product candy this is my
favorite stand my favorite perfume I
just I recognized it in five miles from
someone else like if someone like in
China is wearing it right now I can
smell it here that's how much I love it
then also in tenerife they have these
amazing bracelets here's our bracelets
like ball nugget bracelets and as soon
as I saw these I was like I need all of
them so I got my favorite colors I got
sort of this gold rose gold color I got
black of course I got a bright citrus
yellow
I got a graphite sort of gray gunmetal
gray I got a red and I got a bar of
silver then I look at these two
bracelets at our hotel our hotel was
conquistador in playas just a baby puss
in Tenerife it was a really really good
hotel with a lot of lot of pretty men so
um that is all my stuff I am so happy to
be back I miss you guys so so so much oh

talk English because I don't know
