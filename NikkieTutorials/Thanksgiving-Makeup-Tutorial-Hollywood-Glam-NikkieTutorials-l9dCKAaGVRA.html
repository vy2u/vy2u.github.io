to finally do a Thanksgiving makeup
tutorial I actually came to believe that
I've never done one in six years on
YouTube I've never done a Thanksgiving
makeup tutorial so today is that day
I tried to twist old Hollywood glam to
modern Hollywood glam and that for
Thanksgiving so if you want to know how
to get this Hollywood glam Thanksgiving
makeup look then please stay tuned
alright guys so let's get to it I'm
first prepping my face using my Mac prep
and prime natural radiance in radiant
yellow and Becca shimmering skin
Perfector in moonstone
now I'm taking Mac's Studio sculpt and
mineralized moisture foundation both in
NC 15 and applying it to the face and
then buffing in with my favorite
foundation brush
next up for concealer I'm using Mac's
Pro Longwear also in NC 15 and then
buffing it in using my Sigma f80 6 I
love this brush so much oh my god yeah
now quickly going to set my under eye
area and do my brows off-camera next I'm
taking Mac soft ochre Paint Pot to
prevent the items from creasing and then
moving straight over to NSA Beverly
Hills eyes shadow in bone and applying
that all over my eyelids and inner
corners
not taking honest tests a Beverly Hills
shadows in de-rate and dusty pink and
applying that to my crease and blending
up
going back in with bone I am
highlighting my brow bone and I'm also
really controlling my crease color with
this I can really shape it going back in
with a little bit of dusty rose and just
re intensifying and blending that crease
out even more just make it really nice
and smooth I'm applying the same colors
from the crease to my lower lash line
and I'm connecting the sides to my
crease by doing what you're seeing on
the screen right now huh
and then it's time for the eyeliner I'm
using my Kat Von D tattoo liner in
trooper my favorite and I'm just making
a really thick bold winged eyeliner I'm
starting off on the inner corners of my
eyes and working my way toward the
middle and then placing a line aiming
towards the end of my eyebrows and then
connecting that line to the main line on
my lash line fill it up you've got some
amazing eyeliner this Thanksgiving no
holiday look is completed without a
little bit of sparkle so I'm using my
makeup studio dual effects in shine to
sparkle it up time for some mascara nude
eyeliner and my Mac lashes in number 36
and let's move on to cheeks to sculpt my
face I'm using Illamasqua eyeshadow in
heroine
now I'm taking this Kiko bronzer and
warming up my complexion using that
ain't it pretty
I'm using Bubbe Browns blush in soft
Crowell to perk my cheeks up
and highlighting using my favorite
pigment by Mac vanilla
look at that shine girl I'm taking world
it pencil by Mac for my lips and I'm
applying it as a lipliner and filling my
entire lips in with it and then going
over top using velvet teddy lipstick by
Mac and then to give it a little bit
more of a peachy soft feminine feeling

illamasqua lipstick in over and that
