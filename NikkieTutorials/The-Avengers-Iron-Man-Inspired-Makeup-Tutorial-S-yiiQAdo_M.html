finally my first installment slash
episode of my Avengers tutorials series
I've been planning this for months I've
been announcing this for weeks and
finally it's here at the first one and
first up is I hope this is clear this is
Iron Man um he is actually one of my
favorites
besides Thor because Thor is just my I
just I love Tony Stark and I love his
suit so today I am gonna do my
interpretation on his colors and style
and everything and without any further
ado if you want to know how I got this
look then please keep on watching so the
first thing you want to do is apply a
base there I'll is to prevent the
eyeshadow from creasing and the one I'm
using is my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot I'm
not going to take this Mac Beth mask
shade and smoke eye shadow liner thing
and I'm gonna take the darkside and with
this I'm gonna start defining my crease
by cutting it with an eyeliner Oh Gary
room with Gary
now you're going to blend that out with
your brush of choice and just blend it
out and make it softer now gonna take
max sweep chestnut eyeshadow and from
the makeup studio 18 color eyeshadow
palette I'm gonna make a mixture between
these two bottom red colors and that
little mixture is going over that bath
mask liner now leaving sweet chestnut
out of the mix I'm gonna go and blend
this all up
and I'm going to go a pretty far and
pretty high because this is not an
actual look at all this is more for like
a show
Barbara highlight I will be using my
Inglot palette and I'm gonna use these
two colors now I don't know the names or
the numbers because I couldn't put it
anywhere so I will put that on my blog
the main highlight in color is going to
be this one and then just to make it a
little bit more golden yellow I'm gonna
use that one and then just start
blending the red a little bit more and
make it a little bit more extreme for my
eyelid I'm using that yellow engli color
again and I'm taking a bit of the yellow
from the makeup studio eighteen color
eyeshadow palette this is going all over
the lid for my bottom lash line I'm
gonna use this red from Inglot again the
number will be on my blog and I'm mixing
it with a little bit of sweet chestnut
again they also blend it right here on
that outer third with the yellow or the
gold or however you want to see it using
the same colors I'm gonna make a line
towards my inner corners
I'll leave the first spot open now I'm
going to take these fronts acrylic apple
torch artistic pigment and that is going
on top on my lower lash line or my lower
lid or whatever Tony Stark wouldn't mind
if I set lower lid or laughs fine for my
inner corners I'm using my OCC obscure
pigments I'm gonna and on top of that my
jeweler FEX in shine by makeup studio
then all that is left is to align your
lashes softly with a mixture of a black
eyeshadow and sweet chestnut or whatever
sort of dark burgundy color you have
that's my brother with his best friend
acting like a fool or is it Tony Stark
who knows them I'm gonna run a little
bit more of that Inglot go color along
the highest points of my cheekbone this
just kind of for me completes the look
but of course you have to blend it out
you don't want it to be like stupid now
just gonna curl my lashes and apply some
mascara and the mascara I will be using
is my makeup studio would proof 3d extra
blackboard the chrome or the steel that
um Iron Men has as well I'm actually
gonna use a sheet of Neal Rock and these
are like the minks like stickers for
your nails and this is a metallic red
and I thought this will be perfect to
kind of resemble the chrome or the steel
of his suit so I'm gonna cut a little
curve out of one of the nails and then
just stick it right there under my eyes
at the corners for a nice sort of
finishing touch okay so before we did a
lips let's hop to the cheeks first eye
contour it with my NYX blush and I can
up NYX blush in taupe then to warm up my
face and give me a little bit more of an
healthy glow I used my disobey blush by
Illamasqua
as a blush and I used is really really
lightly I used the Mac tres Gold blush
and this is a really nice bronzy shine
and I used that really what we because
does all is really shiny as well and
then for the gold highlighter I already
told you this but that is from my Inglot
palette that I custom made and I use
these two colors with the emphasis on
that one right there
for my lips I'm gonna use MAC lipstick
in pure Zen and then I'm going to go
back into my Inglot palette I'm gonna
make a mixture between those two again
and I am going to highlight my lips with
that
and that guy's completes my first
