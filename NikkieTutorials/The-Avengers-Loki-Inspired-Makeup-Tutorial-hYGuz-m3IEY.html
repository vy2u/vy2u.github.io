second Avenger series tutorial today on
the menu is Loki gorgeous beautiful Loki
hotness definitely runs in the family of
Thor oh he's adopted hotness just
runs everywhere um so yeah today I am
going to do my second Avengers look and
today is Loki he's not an Avenger he's
the bad guy but I love him I love his
colors I love his his badassness so
today is Loki so if you want to know how
to get this look then please keep on
watching okay so it's always the first
thing you want to do is apply a base
here I was to befriend your eyeshadow
for creasing and the one I'm using it's
my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot use it every
video okay so the first I shadow so
we'll be using our Mex femme Noir and
velvet Moss and I'm gonna make a mixture
between the two and this will be the
perfect low-key green color okay I'm
gonna start off by making a line as I do
an eyeliner so two wing and then I'm
going to go into the crease with this
and I'm gonna make it really really
graphic and sharp and when I look
straight into your mirror and make sure
that you get your natural crease
okay now go ahead and thicken that up
still using the same colors
not going to take a little bit of sugar
pills Midori with that I'm slightly
gonna blend my crease up and you want to
be really really gentle with this
because if you go too high up here or
your symmetry will be gone and it will
all just look weird so make sure you're
blending that really softly and don't go
too harsh because then you have so much
more chance of like really messing it up
taking a fluffier brush blending that
even further up and again really gentle
and soft
okay so now you can really see a line
between Midori and the two matte colors
that we used so I'm going to take velvet
moss the greener so the Selvig Moss is
this one and I'm going to blend that
sort up in between so sort of in-between
the mix to make it all look more blended
okay we're going to leave this for now
and we'll come back to that later on now
I'm going to take that dark crease color
again and apply that as an eyeliner
now I'm gonna take this Illamasqua
pigment in or and I'm gonna apply this
all over my lid where the green hasn't
touched any space yet so any place that
is still bare covered that up with the
Illamasqua pigment in or and then I'm
gonna take this Ben Nye pigments in ice
gold and it's a really nice gold shiny
color it's really messy so make sure
that you clean your room after because
glitter will be everywhere I am applying
this to my inner corner right here and
then blending it out and then also a bit
here on the middle of my lid okay I'm
not gonna reapply some of the green on
my eyeliner and in the crease sort of to
bring back the power into the look
because right now it can be covered in
the glitter or I don't know what to make
sure it's all nice and vibrant and now
taking my Laura Mercier concealer in
number one and I'm just gonna make this
line right here SuperDuper sharp I'm
also gonna run that under my eyes
because some of the pigments may have
come down and I want everything to look
nice and perfect and clean I'm gonna
line my waterline with my Ben Nye
neutralizing cream crayon in the light
and PTO and then that's a finishing
touch from my el Hembrough NARS
eyeshadow duo I'm gonna take the gold
color and I'm gonna put that on my inner
corners as a pop of highlight okay and
that's just gonna curl my lashes with my
few more eyelash curler and then for
mascara I'm gonna use two this is the
makeup studio waterproof 3d extra black
and on top to separate my lashes a
little bit more on the Museum of curl
also by makeup studio and I'm gonna do
my top lashes only so for my cheeks I
already did them prior to filming and
for contouring I use my NYX blush in
taupe uses all the freaking time as the
blush I use NARS luster blush and
it's a really nice natural peachy shiny
blush and to highlight my cheekbones
really nicely I use the max mineralized
skinfinish in lightscapade and soft and
gentle and a little trick to make your
face look more natural and more glowy is
to just take a stippling brush one like
this and then spray it with mac's fix+
sort of like that then bounce it on your
hand and then go over your face and this
will make it look really really really
natural because you're taking away all
the powders that are laying on your skin
so it gives you a really nice glowy
natural touch for my lips I'm just gonna
use my foundation brush and any
foundation that is left in it is now
going onto the lips and then I'm just
gonna dab a little little teeny bit of
pink pink
wet-and-wild lipstick on top and I'm
just gonna dab that and not too much
because I want a really really neutral
lip and that ladies and gentlemen
completes my low-key Avengers inspired
tutorial I hope you enjoyed for a
