that's been going around here on YouTube
for quite a couple of weeks now and this
is the beauty things I suck at tag this
is gonna be so much fun
so with this tag it's all about showing
your sort of beauty flaws and what you
kind of will use sockette I actually
suck it quite a lot of things and if you
want to know what I suck at then please
what I suck it I know don't let your
mind go there No okay so the beauty
thing I suck at number one is and I'm
looking oh my I love my iPhone case I
love it so much just thank you Oh
anyways you didn't think I suck at
number one I cannot for the life of me
do semi messy looks I cannot do the kind
of worn in look that a lot of makeup
artists use that term I cannot do it
with me my look has to be like perfectly
like Photoshop blend it like I blend
till perfection or it has to be a
fashionable mess when people say like
I'm gonna do a smoky eye now with some
eye Kohl and then I'm gonna blend it out
with my finger I'm like I can't blend it
out with my finger I need a brush and if
I don't need a brush I need like gloss
on the lid I need like smudges all over
the lid I can just do like blended with
the finger and just be like it smudged
in sworn-in can't do that it's ah ah ah
mascara smudges on the lash line every
day every single day every makeup
application session I smudged mascara on
my lash line it's just I cannot prevent
it I've tilted my head all the way back
until I had no choice of breaking it I
tried the credit card I tried the the
the card that you put on your lid and
then you just put the mascara on the
card
I end up with mascara smudges on my lash
line I just can't get it out of my hands
it's just like mascara lash line tinted
moisturizer and pin point concealing on
myself now what I like to do for like
when I have clients do makeup on or when
I have a model
really really good skin and she only
needs a like a really tiny bit of
coverage
I put tinted moisturizer on like a
really really light coverage foundation
or tinted moisturizer and I pin point
concealing like I pin I pin it I point
it point the concealer on it and blend
it away I cannot do that on myself
my face is I just need like a shitload
of makeup or nothing it's sort of like
the same as the messy look in the
perfectly blended look I can't find a
way in between like full coverage makeup
or nothing I just need I can't because
when I do like tinted moisturizer and
pin point concealing on myself
I just feel unfinished I feel weird
wearing fake lashes on a daily basis
fake lashes and I never really got along
like I've been doing makeup for for five
years now I think the first three years
of my entire career I didn't touch
lashes I was like and I've mastered how
to put them on now and then on clients
and on models but it's just it's such a
hassle and it's such a process and plus
I feel like they're so heavy on your
eyes and I'm like uh-uh
what round lipstick it's just poo it
looks like he ate a to-go bag of poo I
just faked hands horrible at it because
I am as white as a paper I am as white
as a cow you know fake tanning on meat
just looks orange I look like an oompa
loompa I look patchy and it looks
unblended I just don't know anything
about fake tanning the only thing I know
about fake tanning is from snog marry
avoid there is wearing of my fake tan
info from fake tanning at me I just
don't know I don't know what I'm doing
so I don't do it the last Beauty thing I
have for you and this is a hair thing
doing updos on myself and not messing up
the back I can make it look really good
in the front but in the back it just
looks like a war zone I'm kind of good
at hair in my opinion I can do what
nice hair but myself the back of a knob
do oh girl Oh child yeah so that were my
beauty things I suck at and I actually
