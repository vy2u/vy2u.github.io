know I just felt like using colors kinda
inspired by like carnival colors in Rio
de Janeiro yeah I just basically I just
felt like using colors today yeah I'm
using my BH palette again today um I got
a lot of questions you do another video
with it because everyone's like oh
finally you're doing something with the
palettes and um yeah so today I'm using
it again and yeah if you wanna know how
I got this really bright look then
please keep on watching thing you want
to do is apply a base to your eyes to
prevent your eyeshadow from creasing and
I'm using my BH Cosmetics eyelid primer
today I'm using my BH Cosmetics palette
again and the first color we're going to
use is a mix we're gonna make this pink
right here in the brightest pink with
this purple at the top right here and
with the Mac 239 I'm applying that to do
lid now for the crease I'm going to mix
um this color right here so the color
with this color the dark brown one so
I'm first taking that lighter brown
color and applying that to the crease
and also make that in the outer V right
here before we're gonna take the dark
brown color I'm going to go in this
orange right here and blend that Brown
up on the Sigma 226 and then I'm just
going above the brown and with this you
can go as far in as you like as you know
I like to go pretty far in okay I'm not
taking a dark brown color to show you
and we're going to intensify that outer
so just make a strike going down a
little bit more your strop and then go
into the crease and you can make this as
dark as you like I like to make it set
me dark blend it with the pink and just
blend it into the look for the highlight
on my brow bone I am taking this white
color and the color underneath and apply
that to the brow bone and take a big
fluffy brush and go in the color
underneath the white only and blended
down this will give the orange a nice
Sheen for the inner corners I'm taking
this yellow right here and I'm applying
that to the inner corners are really
heavily so I just dump it on and blend
it in there's a little bit into the
inner corners of the lower part of the
eye I'm now going to take some concealer
and a concealer brush and what I'm gonna
do is I'm going to make a really sharp
line on the outer edge for the lower
lash line
I'm going to take that dark brown color
that we apply to the crease and apply
that to the bottom lash line as well
sup around there now take the brightest
red up the palate I can show you but
there's own really true red in it and
I'm gonna take that one and I'm applying
that in the middle of the yellow and the
brown and that completes everything we
need for eyeshadow now I'm just gonna
line my waterline with Urban Decay 24/7
in zero and curl the lashes and put some
mascara on and this is my favorite
makeup
studio maximum volume mascara so I'm
gonna do all of them right now and then
it will be back aboard ellipse X for the
lips you can actually go anywhere you
want you can do news for nudes
I'd suggest the kissable lip colors from
Mac this is Bhumi or and Chong say they
both would work fine with this look you
can apply a bright red this is crimson
lip makes my Mac you can apply an
amazing orange color this is safety
orange by OCC um you can apply a dark
dark red lipstick this is my favorite
this is my sees many Pennock black rose
or you can go on the bright side of life
like the title and I'm actually going to
use a lime crime lipstick in century
fuchsia then I edit Mac rebel on top to
darken it up a bit because I like darker
colors on me better um so yeah that
completes this um really bright like
carnival Rio de Janeiro inspired look
yeah I just felt like using bright
colors today
