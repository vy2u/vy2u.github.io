didn't think I would do another one of
this this year welcome to view Cimber
how would you know I really want to
thank you guys for all the love and
support you gave me in Butte Ober which
was back in October I felt so loved and
so supported I was like I need to do
this again this year imbue cember and
the rules have changed a little tiny bit
to make it a little bit more easy on me
I will upload a video every other three
days so not every other two days but
every other three days so let's say I
post something on Monday I won't post
anything on Tuesday and Wednesday but on
Thursday did you get that that way it
will be a little bit more good for me to
not overwork myself and stress out so I
kind of get a lot more time to work on
better videos so today it's a video
number one from Houston bur every time I
see tags going around on YouTube I'm
like I need to come up with one of those
because I feel like tags are so much fun
and you can really get to know that like
the beauty guru that you're watching I
had so much fun coming up with the
questions and everything so um today
we're going to do the December tag I
wanted sort of like a band bang no bang
I feel like I'm interviewing myself in
my own talk show right now welcome to
Nikki lately okay question number one
what do you love most about December
what I love most of our December is one
the beautiful picture so you can
Instagram when it's snowing I love
Instagram lately and I feel like when
there's snow everything looks pretty
except you have to drive in it and that
it's not so pretty I love the coziness
and the warmth December has here in
Holland um it's sort of that entire I
told this my mom like last week we were
walking down the streets and you can
really feel that that vibe of December
is coming and you can feel like everyone
is really supportive of each other and
everyone there sort of like this vibe
out on the streets in December it's like
this five I can't you have to feel it
it's lovely
okay question number two what is your
favorite perfume to wear with the
holidays I love really sweet assertive
mysterious sort of smells I came up with
this combo that I've been loving for
about a week now and I really want to
wear this throughout this month and with
the holidays as well this is Victoria's
Secret pink with a splash a soft and
dreamy all-over body mist this is my
signature smell for the last couple of
three months everywhere I go and I put
this on people are like Oh Nikki that's
Nikki hi Nik
so I always use that but I wanted to
make it a little bit more sort of
mysterious and for that I use the
hypnotic poison by dior and this is the
essence ooh and question number three
which three products can't you live
without this December so in December I
am all about warm colors shiny warm
colors and just warm and the first thing
that came to mind was my amber lights
eyeshadow by Mac this is literally the
most beautiful eyeshadow mec has in my
opinion it's super duper shiny it's sort
of a bronze copper shine it's super
pigmented it's beautiful
and this is the first thing that came to
mind then also in the month of December
I love glitters and sparkly things and
this is um you guys know this this is
the makeup studio dual effects and shine
I use this with almost every look I just
put it on my inner corners or on my lid
and I'm good to go and I'm sort of all
dazzled up for like the holidays or the
month of December so this is sort of my
Sparkle go to you and then because I
basically eat like a crazy person this
month I also really want to contour so
this is sort of a combination of
products these are the NYX blush in
taupe and the Illamasqua blushing
disobey and I use this to contour the
hell if my cheekbones do look somewhat
skinny Christian number four what is
your go-to look this month is a winged
eyeliner red lipstick tell us it really
depends with me but normally around the
colder days I like to really warm up my
look because I feel like outside is
really gray really cold and blue so I
kind of walk around like a freak show
with bronze eyeshadow
amber lights on my lid and dual effects
in shining on my inner corner so my go
to look for December is sort of sparkly
bronzy smoky soft ice and then when I go
out or at night I just at highlighter
sorta put a round right now it's just a
little bit less they're crushing number
five what is your most favorite glittery
product and can be anything I was really
turned up between a really glittery
scarf that I have and I love but what
actually one was my OPI golden eye nail
polish I've been wearing this in a
couple of videos of mine and this is
this is like Christmas in a bottle it's
gold it's foil it's yellow it's
absolutely amazing so this one from my
glittery scarf question number six show
us your favorite ornament from your
Christmas tree now this is for all the
people that actually have a Christmas
tree I went shopping a couple of weeks
ago and they already it was like mid
November they already had like Christmas
tree decorations and ornaments then I
kind of bumped in to this little guy
right here this is a cupcake sort of
packaged in this really cute sort of
glass holder and I can't wait to put
this in our tree I'm filming this in
like the last week of November so our
tree isn't up yet question number seven
which candy are you going to eat too
much of this month to really touch
things one is even up already that's
called paper notes on paper notan I
always want to talk English and then I
have to say something Dutch it's like
the first three times it's like paper
nota and paper notes are sort of like
these are like cookies but better and
smaller and with Sinterklaas always
comes tight eyes tight eyes why isn't
there an English word Thai chunks Thai
chunks right the packaging says Titans
but these are sort of like really they
well when they I cannot explain this
these are sort of cookies but really
soft and old ish so tight Taichung tight
eyes and paper
is what I eat all the time from November
to like February question number 8 what
is your favorite December / holiday
related movie or TV show to watch home
alone one two three and four and is
there a five already me and my brother
watch home alone three all the time the
part where the parrot it's like singing
in the shower and then the villain comes
in and then he sees that the sort of
poster of the naked woman left our asses
off when we were younger so home alone 1
2 &amp;amp; 3 are my favorites and then 4 is
okay but my favorite probably is number
two and three question number nine what
do you really hope since I has wrapped
in a present for you this year I
actually bumped into this gorgeous ring
a couple of days ago and it is super
duper expensive but I kind of feel like
I need this ring it's rose gold it has
three diamonds and it's really small and
cute and sort of elegant and nice I
really want a ring that I can wear
full-time so I read this one full time
and I really want that other one
full-time but the price of it is 350
euros so I kind of when I saw that price
I was like oh my poor poor heart but I
really really hope Santa comes up with
that for me this year and if he doesn't
do that he better come up with a
shitload of neck or a shitload of
brushes or a shitload of candy to make
me feel better
