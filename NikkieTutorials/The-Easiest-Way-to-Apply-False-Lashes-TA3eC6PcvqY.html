how I like to apply my eyelashes my fake
eyelashes and um let me tell you if one
person sucks at doing eyelashes it's
just I I've been doing makeup for like
four to five years now
and I think three years into doing
makeup I still can't manage putting on
those damn false lashes and I just know
that the struggle is real I think
putting on fake eyelashes is such a
intimidating sort of process and it's
just it scares people and it definitely
scared me I never really wore false
eyelashes in my looks because the one I
just couldn't bear like the process
because I sucked and - I just the
struggle so I'm going to show you a
really easy and quick way of applying
false lashes in a way that everyone like
everybody on planet earth can do it and
I will assure you that you will manage
to put lashes on after this video then
please keep on watching now if you did
not manage to put the lashes on we might
have a problem okay so here we go the
lashes I'll be using today are by Miss
adoro
and I got these at IMATS New York about
three years ago and these are the seven
for 7ms and they're just really natural
and full and fluffy so the biggest rig
that helped me and will probably help
you as well is cut the lashes you can
cut them in half you can cut them in
three you can cut them in four or five
sticks you can't cut them in as many
pieces as you wish as you desire but you
have to cut them so for example when you
would apply a full strip like an entire
full strip of one of these lashes there
will be a lot of tension on the corners
causing them to lift up very quick and
when you cut them the tension sort of
gets released from the corners and there
won't be as much tension on them sort of
getting rid of the entire lifting
cornice problem in a hole so what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna take one of the
lash isn't going to take the one for my
right eye I'm gonna cut them in half
again you can cut them in three whatever
you desire I'm gonna go for a half half
because I just like the way that
works so I'm going to get my little
scissors and cut them in Tov this is
about half way in and snap oh my gosh
and the glue I'll be using today is by
duo this is the eyelash adhesive and
clear you also have a black one don't
really never really centered into that
world my little trick is before you do
mascara already apply some glue to the
lid of your eyelash package and this is
what caused a lot of frustration when
applying lashes is that my lash glue
wouldn't become tacky and sticky and it
just wouldn't stick on to my eyes so
what I found work best is if you apply
some eyelash glue to the lid of your
eyelash package and just let it stick do
your mascara even maybe do it before
your eyeliner but because I already did
some eyeliner and mascara work today
it's already on for a couple of minutes
so I did that just give it time to
become tacky before I apply the lash I
do want to tell that eyeliner is always
a good option a good flake like a nice
black flick will always help you sort of
you know conceal your flaws eyelash wise
so for me the routine will always be
glue put it on your eyelash package let
them become tacky do your eyeliner
optional if you're going for a liner do
your mascara and then do your lashes
okay so now that we've got that covered
I'm going to take the outer part of the
caught lash and I'm going to take
tweezers
I cannot apply lashes with my fingers I
cannot do it with special lash
applicators I just use tweezers I put my
tweezer right at the base of the lash a
little bit away from it I then just take
anything pointing near to me this is a
lip liner by Mac and with the point of
the tip I'm going to go into my glue and
I'm going to cover the lash band and
what I found is the more glue the worse
and the less glue the worst you kind of
want to go in between you don't wanna
overload the lash band with glue you
don't want to you know tap it down a
little bit no you just wanna a good coat
and especially get those corners and it
kind of flap it around a bit then what I
do is take my hand mirror and my lash
and I looked
into that mirror and I place the lash as
close to the roots of my natural lashes
on the outer corner now once you've
placed it there let it rest don't touch
it don't start playing with it yet
because what you want to do now is let
that part where the lash hits the glue
let that kind of settle in a bit let
them know each other a little bit you
know let them have their first date you
know let them speed date for a little
and then once you've went to first base
which is kissing you take your tweezers
and then you can start pulling it really
close to the corners and as you can see
with just the slightest tap of my finger
it just kind of adheres to the skin
already without really doing much now
I'm going to take the remaining part so
if you have three parts start with the
outer corner work your way in and do the
same with the gloom hand mirror look
down place lash on skin let it rest
don't touch
let them go to that first base let them
kiss let them meet each other and then
with my tweezer putting the corners in
the right era area I don't know and if
we're the very inner corner you want to
take your tweezer take the tips and kind
of stamp it on to the skin like that
then again you know it just hit that
ground and just hit that base now let
them get to know each other let them
make them stick a little bit with my
fingers I'm going to tap the tips of the
lashes really pushing it onto the flesh
onto the skin and especially with that
inner corner you kind of want to look
away and tap it on to that skin really
press it on there a ladies and gentlemen
your lash is on you did it you succeeded
you finished this level of makeup and
I'm so proud of you and that guys is how
I like to apply my false lashes and this
is what really helped me master the
eyelash process throughout the years
because I sucked
applying lashes
I started doing makeup its Savior it's
it's eyelash Savior say that concludes
