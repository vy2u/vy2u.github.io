today I'm gonna do a tutorial inspired
by the new promo images from the Hunger
Games and this one is from Katniss
Everdeen Jennifer Lawrence I love her so
much
she's like the queen of 9gag right now I
saw these images and I saw Katniss or
Jennifer and I saw the makeup and it was
so amazing and so colorful and so the
Hunger Games then I just had to do this
tutorial so today I'm all glammed up I
even tried to match my hair to hers so
today I am here to do this look from The
Hunger Games from the promo images so if
you want to know how to get this look
then please keep on watching so of
course the first thing I'm gonna do is
apply a base to your eyelids to prevent
the eyeshadow from creasing especially
when you're a girl on fire things seem
to get a little bit crazy here and there
I'm going to use my Mac soft ochre Paint
Pot as usual but I'm gonna use a brush
for it now because I have used so much
of this that I can no longer retail with
my fingers I have to use a brush for it
so it's almost done it's almost done I'm
gonna start up with this slide on pencil
by NYX and this is called a tropical
green and with this you want to start
lining your lashline
then take an angled brush and blend the
edges softly and just make it a soft
line this will get the look some depth
later on okay quickly gonna take kid
eyes shadow by Mac and with this
undefined the inner part of my crease
and sort of my nose line normally I
would do this to somewhat make my nose
look smaller but for this look I'm doing
it to add warmth to the look and make it
a little bit more wearable because if
you do all of this without the brown it
kind of becomes this sort of 80's mess
but when you apply that Brown here it
becomes a really nice wearable color I'm
going to take a face powder and quickly
Matan down my brow bone and inner
corners further that I will be singing
this turquoise blue color by Inc
and I will put the number on my blog
because I don't know it out the top of
my head and I'm gonna mix it with a
little bit of Mac steamy eyeshadows and
just start patting this on to the lid
and blending up until the crease then
I'm gonna take sugar pale smokey or
muchy or mochi or whatever the mochi
mochi oh she is and slightly blend up
between the blue and the lid color now
taking gravel I should have my Mac and
start blending this onto your lower lash
line and for now keep it simple don't do
anything weird yeah okay now with a
really sharp angled brush sort of lying
that gravel color like sort of a little
bit below your inner corners
so that sort of keeps you left with like
this gap and that is exactly what you
want because from a distance it will
kind of make your eyes look bigger plus
it just drag queens do it and when drag
queens do it it's okay
in my opinion I'm gonna mix that sugar
pill Moche color with that gravel color
and sort of make a mixture and then
blend the lower lashline with that okay
so this is kind of hard to explain but
with that gravel color and kind of gonna
take it out and then put it back into
the crease so from underneath I'm gonna
go up and then back in and that will
kind of give you that nice shape on the
outer corners
and now of course what you want to do
with that is add more color and blend it
out nicely so that is exactly what I'm
gonna do right now I'm gonna take my
Inglot color again and mix it with
gravel and then put that in my crease to
blend it out I'm gonna blend it out even
more using that mochi color or Maki
whatever by sugarpill it's a lovely
color but how the hell do you pronounce
it and I'm gonna darken the entire outer
part up with gravel only by Mac just to
give it more depth and I'm also gonna
run that along the roots of my lashes
for that pop of shimmer on the very
inner lid
I used a color by Mac called aqua vert
and that is what I'm gonna apply to that
spot right now and just put that on the
very very inner part of your lid to the
crease and then kind of blend it in to
the other color remember that little
drag queen tip that like that drag queen
corner that we left out good because I
almost did for that it will be taking my
makeup studio jewel FEX and shine and
pop that right in between those lines
and like on my inner corners for a pop
of sparkle oh you should see my desk
right now it is one big mess Gail came
right in and ruined everything for me
and peeta from calling my desk PETA
okay Firth II waterline I'm going to
take my slide on pencil by NYX in jet
black and what I'm gonna do is apply
that to my order line right till the
point where that drag queen tip starts
stop what I'm gonna do right now is
apply some mascara and the mascara that
we'll be using is my waterproof 3d extra
black my makeup studio and on top I'm
gonna use my benefits they're real and
then after that I'm gonna apply some
falsies these are the Miss adoro 7 4 7
mm okay so for the rhinestones now
normally I would take rhinestones and
put some eyelash glue on top of them and
then stick them on but these that I got
are actually self-adhesive so I don't
have to do anything with these I just
have to pick these up put them on my eye
and I'm done and it's literally just
taking your tweezer picking up one of
the silver rhinestones and then just
sticking it on so that is basically all
to it
so prior to filming I already contoured
my face and what I guess we that is
pretty well known by now it's my NYX
blush in taupe and my illamasqua blush
in disobey to warm up my face a little
bit more for blushing cheeks themselves
Katniss or Jennifer Lawrence wasn't
really wearing a whole lot of stuff
there was a really nice glow though so
I'm just gonna warm up my cheeks a
little bit more making a mixture between
Mac's mineralize skinfinish in medium
deep which would be perfect for
contouring a bit as well or warming up
the face and then I'm gonna mix it with
a sex appeal by NARS and that will make
a really nice sort of wearable warm
color and to really give myself that
amazing glow we're gonna take max
pigment in vanilla this is sort of like
if you want like a million dollar bucks
glow vanilla pigment by Mac and I'm just
placing that on the highest points of my
cheekbones the bridge of my nose and my
cupids bow and working my way up and
Fred will lips were just keeping it
really nude and simple because all the
attention has to go to the eyes baby so
for my lips I'm gonna take my YSL East
and the LA Rouge Phillips pearl lipstick
in number 107 and I believe this is
called impetuous beige oh and I love
this lipstick so much so I just put that
on and that tributes completes my The
Hunger Games Katniss Everdeen promo
