insanely crazy bright look this is
inspired by the Hunger Games
that capital a inspired tutorial with
like crazy neon colors and something
maybe even if a trinket would wear I
decided to throw some some voltage
feelings into it as well so this is sort
of my editorial Capitol look for the
Hunger Games I even did my hair like
crazy I know people are not going to
wear this to like grocery shopping or
like babysitting a newborn because that
newborn will probably die or get really
shocked to not die but really like it
will have issues later on in his life
this is just me having fun
so if you want to know I did this then
please keep on watching
but the first thing I'm going to do is
apply a base to my eyelids brow bone and
underneath to prevent everything from
creasing and the one I'm using is Mac
soft ochre Paint Pot and to make the
bright colors pop a bit more I am going
to use milk by NYX first eye shadows
that we'll be using are sugar pills
dolly pop and Mex irani and those two
colors are going all over my lid and
blended up towards the crease the next
color we'll be using is by England and
this is a body pigment and this is
number 126 now I'm going to blend this
color into my crease and this is sort of
going to be the main like attraction
color for the crease it's going to be
the showstopper of the crease make sure
that you go up as hell is go all the way
up to this brows and work it blend it
into my nose line and this will give it
that really really nice vogue fashion
feeling now going to take Mac's
curl eyeshadow and I'm mixing a bit with
Mac's feather pink and those two colors
ladies and gentlemen are going on to the
brow bone and kind of blending it out as
well you don't want it to be too harsh
and just start making a nice gradient
between the three colors and making it
nice and blended now taking the light
pink from the sleek brights ultra matte
palette and a little bit of sugar snack
by Mac with those two colors I'm
blending the brow bone even further and
even has my brows for my brows I'm going
to use the orange color from the sleek
ultra metz bright palette and to make it
a little bit darker I'm using Mac's red
brick okay now fill in the rest of the
brow to the bottom and then fill it in
then because I feel this isn't
interesting enough I'm going to put a
neon orange red
kryolan aquacolor on top what I'm going
to do is make that wet with my fix+
by Matt and then I'm going to take a
brush like that and because I want to
use it for my brows I'm really going to
go like that sort of brushes get all
like messed up and like boom and now I'm
just brushing some onto the front of my
brow and working to the middle and
because you did this
it looks more like hair instead of like
putting on stuff on your brow that
doesn't belong there and then just go to
like half your brow okay going back to
the light pink colors I'm going to
highlight my brow bone and this is the
perfect time to sort of get great like
sharp brow underneath and just do that
with your eye shadow and then blend it
with the mix of course
okay I'm not just going to take all the
colors I've used and just start blending
and making everything look perfect and
like a nice gradient and my nose eye
needs to be softer so I'm just going to
play with it and see what looks best and
then I will leave that for the bottom
lip for the bottom lid I will be using
shade ster blush by Mac and just going
to sort of blending that along my lower
lash line going all the way in and then
blend it down now because it is a little
bit too Brown I'm going to take my
Inglot pigment and run that along and
over it and that will make it more of
the other colors that we've used so it
totally matches to glam up my inner
corners I will be using this makeup to
do dual effects and shine this is one of
my all-time favorite products with that
on my inner corners then blending it
down and up all that is left to do now
is apply an eyeliner to my waterline and
apply some mascara the eyeliner I will
be using is by Illamasqua and this is a
light yellow and this is called King and
then for mascara as always my makeups
waterproof 3d extra bug I use this every
single day
okay so four chicks are gonna have a
little bit of fun I want to go really
bronze and orange life because it's
crazy and a capital is sort of crazy but
I also want to keep having that sort of
fashion feeling so I'm going to give it
an amazing three-dimensional shine for
the contour and the blush I'm first
going to start off with shades dirt
blush again by Mac I'm just going to
start off by contouring my cheeks and
blending upwards then I'm going to take
coral eyeshadow by Mac and continue sort
of above the contour blending it in I'm
going to take shader and coral again and
I'm going to blend those two on my
temples and then also kind of blend that
point from your eye shadow out to your
temples as well make it a bit more
painting on a feather
pink by Mac again and I'm going to use
that as a blush for the high-fashion
highlight I'm going to use a highlighter
by Mac called suburb this is an extra
dimension skin finish and I'm just going
to blend that unlike the highest points
of my cheekbones first this is
absolutely gorgeous also right here
above your arch of your eyebrow and then
to give it that really cool pinky shine
I am going to use a pigment by OCC and
this is called the Torah and blend that
on top of suburban into your contour
so I am going to apply the Kryolan UV
dayglo aqua color in red
i'ma lips as well this is neon as crazy
the camera's not even picking it up
oh yeah we're doing it oh yeah I love
this so this is a look with the crazy
neon lip now I do not suggest putting
this on your lip if you want to wear
this the entire day because it is
SuperDuper drying like the inside is
starting to brittle off of it because it
is so dry so for photoshoots and shows
this is absolutely amazing but if you
want to wear this the entire day don't
do it for a fullness of every single
product use goes from website these
