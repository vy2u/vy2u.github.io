Hunger Games the Mockingjay part 1 and I
kind of missed seeing these crazy
capital looks because war has begun and
even Effie is now wearing grey
I mean Effie wearing grey I mean come on
I absolutely loved the movie and I loved
I absolutely loved the fact that
Jennifer Lawrence is breaking through
with the hanging tree song every time
the hanging tree comes on the radio I I
go numb like everything in my body goes
numb and I'm like are you are you see
after that movie I was kind of missing
the crazy capital look so I decided to
create one for myself today and this is
sort of like a teenage girl living in
the capital you know getting used to her
bright where it's dials sorta I don't
know so anyways if you want to know has
get this Hunger Games Capitol inspired
makeup look then please stay tuned oh
and the wig is by hair he goes love hair
he goes check him out on Instagram he
rocks alright guys so even with the look
as this one you still want a prime so
that the look pops and all the colors
that you put on top pop and become
vibrant and bright so I'm still using my
soft ochre Paint Pot by Mac I tried and
trued that I say it if you don't say it
like that I will from now on okay and
let's see how I begun this mess I'm
first going in a sugar pill I shadow
called dolly pop and I'm mixing this on
my very inner crease it's okay if color
comes on the lid we'll focus on that
later but for now apply this to the very
inner crease sort of make a little C
shape with this like that and then go
towards your nose bridge then I'm taking
another sugarpill shadow this is flame
point and with this I'm going even
further to my nose and sort of the
inside of my eye right here from the
right track baby
response then I don't remember then that
orange is also going the normal crease
of the outer part right here ish then
I'm going in my color pop super shock
pressed pigment in slave to pink and a
picking some of that up and applying it
really low to the outer corner of my
lower lash line and then also dragging
it out and back into the crease again
then going back in with flame point and
continuing from that pink and then
taking the pink again and going on my
inner corner now I'm taking sugar pills
butter cupcake and this is going right
in the middle and this can go pretty far
down and also we'll end up with the
other colors then with a fluffy blending
brush I'm taking the butter cupcake
again and I'm applying this right on my
nose bridge and sort of inner corners of
my eyes and then also above that pink
and orange now going in with poison plum
and with this I'm going to start shaping
this entire look and give it more depth
for milodon taking another colour-pop
super shock shadow and this is ratchet
and this is going all the way over the
lid meaning up to that crease over top
I'm applying Anasazi Beverly Hills
eyeshadow black diamond and now it's
time to start blending that black into
the colorful part
then going in with another super shock
shadow by colour-pop I'm on a roll with
these and taking empire an empire is
sort of going from the line where the
black stops and placing it there and
fading it down so you get this really
nice a sort of deep set eyes effect so
right here apply it sort of like a cut
crease okay now all you want to do is
finish off with lashes but before you do
that there's one finishing touch I
bought these little things for nail art
and in our little square it's gold
squares and I thought when you tilt them
a little bit to the other direction they
become like little diamonds so what I'm
going to do is place one mini dud of
eyelash glue right beneath the yellow
and that is where I'm going to apply the
little stud and then quickly taking a
little bit of makeup studio jewel fix
and shine and going over the yellow and
the middle of my eyelids okay so that's
it for eyes now I'm going to apply some
lashes these are the house of lashes
ikonics
and then it will be back okay so for the
cheeks I want to go contoured with a
little bit of blush because my skin is
looking very pale right now so I do want
all the attention to still go to the
eyes but a little bit of cheek is always
good so first going to contour using my
heroine eyes shadow by Illamasqua
then for blush I'm going to use Luminoso
by Milani and I'm applying this straight
on to the apples of my cheeks really in
the middle then for highlighter I'm
going to use Becca moonstone eye I've
been contemplating about bathing in this
product I love it so much and you just
want to add that right here next to
Breathitt smokey eye stops and then
blend it out and also here on the nose
and then I'm actually quickly going to
go back into heroine and I'm going to
define my Cupid's bow right here so
everyone almost everyone naturally has a
shadow right in between here and I'm
going to really exaggerate that
and then for lips I'm going to keep them
nude and then highlight with golds and
add these things that are on my eyes to
my lips also okay so for a lipstick I'll
be using my hourglass femme nude number
one newt lipstick then I'm going to take
the color pop super shock shadow in get
lucky which is a cool toned gold and I'm
applying this to my Cupid's bow the top
of my lip and the middle of my bottom
lip and then again some lash glue and
then three of those weird little squared
of Neill design things on the lips
and that guy's concludes this The Hunger
Games capital a girl inspired makeup
