I'm finally going to do a tutorial on
the Hunger Games this is my inspired
interpretation on the girl on fire
Katniss Everdeen basically when I was
reading the books and I read the girl
fired this is what popped up in my head
my flames are falling off so if you want
to know how to get this campus Everdeen
the girl on fire inspired makeup
tutorial then please keep watching
so of course the first thing I'm going
to do is apply a base to your eyelid to
prevent this all from creasing and the
one I'm using is my Mac soft ochre Paint
Pot okay so the eyeshadow so we'll be
starting off with our mix embark and
Foley and I'm just starting by blending
those at my lower lash line I'm going
all the way in let out a point I'm going
to go straight out and this will sort of
be the direction of where we want the
entire look to go to and taking those
two colors again I'm going to blend them
into my crease and then all the way to
the inner corner this will give an
amazing depth in the end now I'm going
to take sugar pills flame point and I'm
going to blend flame point at the inner
part of the lower lid so sort of the
inner part right here next I will be
using love+ I shadow by sugarpill just
continue doing that and going to that
wing outside okay taking a love+
again and Foley again and mix the two
together with that I'm starting off to
blend my crease especially on this inner
corner because that will bring a lot of
depth to the look taking flame point and
a little bit of red brick eyeshadow by
Mac really going to start blending that
on the outer part it's sort of like
framing the eye just like a frame around
the eye with a bright color now we'll be
using sugar pills butter cupcake next
goldenrod and then also a bit of gold
mine by Mac what I'm going to do with
that is sort of drag out the shape to my
temples and then really sort of make it
a mask so I'm going to drag this all out
onto my temples and onto my forehead I
really make it sort of like a fire I
mean it's a girl fire so
we're gonna blend like wrong fire Oh
fire like that Oh sort of I also wanted
to just punch them right here for a nice
touch later on taking a bit of mix amber
light eyeshadow I'm sort of just adding
that to the mix because of course flames
aren't met you just want to take your
colors and just start blending it out
that's all I can say just blend it out
and play with it and then once you feel
like you're losing colors just reapply
them into the mix I'm going to take some
of the darker color and blend that out
as well I'm applying gold mine eye
shadow to my brow bone as a highlight
only so just apply it as a brow bone
highlight now I'm also gonna pop some
yellow onto my inner corners and blended
up fire gums up wear like warmth goes up
so our eye shadows going up as well the
dupes now going back into the brown
colours we use I'm going to apply a
little bit more definition into my
crease and into that nose bridge light
right here just for some more darkness
it's a matte black eyeshadow I'm filling
up my lid except for like the beginning
part I'm leaving that spot open so sort
of just like a diagonal line to the
crease to leave a part of the lid there
and of course you want to blend that
into the crease and into the mixture as
well I'm even going to bring some black
into that inner part and then blend it
in of course you want to blend blend
level in the one then with the black I
should I'm also really gonna darken up
that lower lash line
so right now I'm just playing with
everything and just kind of blending and
adding colors for my eyelid I'm using a
Jesse's girl i pigmen I don't know what
the name is but I will find that out and
put that on my blog and with a slightly
damp brush that is going on to the lid
part that didn't have any shadows yet
and went back into my black eyeshadow
and now I'm blending that with the
Jessie's Girl pigment to really give it
a nice seamless blend that is the word
of the video people blend BL e and D for
my waterline I'm using my Urban Decay
24/7 glide-on eye pencil you want this
to be as black as a friggin black hole
I'm quickly going to apply some mascara
and the one I'm using is by make ups to
you and this is the what approved 3d
extra black and yeah
the cars a is were resolute liquid metal
by Illamasqua this is a no liquid metal
by Illamasqua don't know name but I will
put that on my blog therefore the
highlighted gold flames
I used design Pro Sonny Gold pro extreme
color art basically all I did was with
my finger I just scooped some of the
product out until it's on the finger and
basically if this was my eye this is all
I did like that I just placed the
product and then sort of blended it in
so that I just took some of this
Illamasqua bronzy liquid metal and I
just did the same and basically all I
did was play with it play with it and
blend so yeah this is it from up close
that is sort of how I played with the
flames and then always on the ends I
kind of did this with my finger to make
a more like blended into my skin but
that is basically how I did it on my
eyes okay I'm not going to take some of
these like gold paper um you know I
don't know the name of it right now but
you know what it is and I'm just going
to stick some random little little
little enemies thoughts throughout the
flames and to make them stick I'm going
to use my Illamasqua sealing gel
you
I first warmed up and shaved my face
with some cream products again and this
is the met cream core Basin orange and I
mix that with bamboo and I set my entire
face with powder and win a little over
with it again with some bronzer the one
I'm using for that is the Lancome star
bronzer number three and then also I'm
going to highlight the freaking crap out
of my face with my extra dimension skin
finish in whisper of guilt by Mac Hollow
and again I already have some of this on
but more is better for this look and
this is really pretty your Cupid's bow
for my lips I'm going to keep them nude
because I kind of do I need to explain
more ultimate color lipstick by Catrice
