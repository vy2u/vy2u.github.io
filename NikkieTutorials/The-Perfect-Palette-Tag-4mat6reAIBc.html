what I got tagged I have seen the
perfect palette tag going round and I
was like okay I'm not gonna do it I'm
just gonna wait till someone tags me and
I waited and I waited and I wait and
then there was Rachel and if you don't
know Rachel Rachel goes by under many
different names we have Rachel
Whitehurst we have 87 days before we
have I call it ambrosia
we have Rachel girl so I want to thank
Rachel for actually tagging me she
skipped me once now she knows so today I
am here to do the perfect palette tag
and in this tag you get eight questions
so you get eight questions about
palettes and then you have to choose to
your answer with a palette and then you
show people your palette okay so no
blabber here we go for more blabber
about palettes first question is best
packaging to tie for Urban Decay's
Glinda pellets because it's so
majestical look at it it has sort of
like a lights galaxy on it and then when
you open it look at that will you look
at that I love the entire feel of this
packaging it's just so damn gorgeous I
love this packaging but I also I also
love benefits world-famous neutrals
palette and there you have I know soft
this girl right here is called I Nessa
and just I love this packaging as well
it's so cute see and it's even a little
bit retro and I'm a bigger for packaging
like this so um it's got to be a tie
between my glinda pellets and the world
famous neutrals palette question number
two best color payoff easy this is
actually not a Pella that you can buy I
actually put it together myself you can
get them in a palette with all of these
colors welcome to my Z palette where I
put my sugar pill colors in one of my
friends Joyce is she got a palette with
all the sugar pill colors in one palette
from sugarpill itself so it does exist
in the palette but I put it in my Z
palette but the best color payoff
hands down is for sugar pills whenever I
need to do a bright look I just
instantly go to my sugar pill colors
because you cannot go wrong with them
they're so pigmented they're so bright
vivid amazing Matt I love them sugar
pill eyes shadows are the bomb.com
question number three is the most
versatile it kind of depends if you're a
neutral kind of person or you're a
bright colored person if you're a
neutral person I highly suggest the fees
art eyeshadow palette in number one you
can see the pan porn on it I use this
til death when I run out of most of the
colors I will purchase a new one because
this palette has been with me for so
long and it has never left me in the
rain in the cold I love this and if
you're a neutral lover this is the most
versatile product ever because you have
your warm Browns your cooler Browns your
black your highlighting colors are
blending crop below but if you're a
colorful person I would say just go for
the sugarpill palette because then color
until you die basically this of course
is a little bit hardcore for every day
so maybe then their urban decay Glinda
palette because it has neutral colors
but it also has a purple and a pink and
sort of silvery duochrome II colors so
it's kinda what type of person you are
next question is best for traveling
again I would go for my if you saw it I
shot a pellet in number one for my
newfound love is the Bobbi Brown rich
chocolate pellet which is also a neutral
palette but it has a shimmery color and
it's just it's all I love this palette
so much it is so amazing so that's for
traveling again if you're a neutral kind
of person then I I think I would go for
the Bobbi Brown one it's smaller it's
less thick than the fees art one I think
I would go for the Bobbi Brown one
biggest regret now holds your panties
that hold your socks because they're
about to drop off donate I will never
understand the hype about the naked
pellets I try I try so hard
to understand and I understand about the
first naked pellet the first one naked
palette number one but the second it's
just I look look at the shadows they
look untouched you know why because I
never touched them yes it's a fun
palette yes you have your beautiful
shimmery colors and everything but like
two eyeshadows and this pellet are met
you cannot you cannot do an entire look
with shimmery colors you cannot it
doesn't work because it doesn't work it
is so overhyped I cannot get over it
next question is best color names best
color names have to go to benefit
because if I just tell you the names of
the world-famous neutrals palette we
have called my buff we have kissed me
I'm tipsy we have it's complicated and
we have gilt
e pleasure and that's just for those
four colors right there and I really
love that and then also the Too Faced
natural eye it has really good names
you have Velvet Revolver sex breath ah
push-up erotica honeypot cacao puffs
okay the next question is least used I'm
so sorry for all the naked lovers out
there I really I have tried it with this
palette I have like purposely putted on
my desk to use it and I would just shove
it away because I didn't want to and
again if you look at the shadows they
almost look untouched it's because I
almost don't touch them the only colors
of the Naked 2 that I really like are
topper but that has followed like no
other I really like Verve and IDK but
other than that I'm I I try the next
question is number 8 which is most used
was loved and desert island and with
that I think they mean that you have to
name one palette your most youths
palette your most loved pellet and the
pellet that you ultimately would bring
to a desert island if you would end up
being there this was hard for me because
between my two babies and that word my
bubby brown rich chocolate palette or my
face our eye shadow palette number one
des retard eye shadow paladin number one
is this is my child I would I would
adopt this as my child I would keep it
as my child i won and if my child so my
most loved most used and what would
accompany me on a desert island would be
the seaside eyeshadow palette number one
just because you have your cooler shades
your warmer shades you're blending
shapes your highlight shades I love this
palette I am going to leave a list in my
infobox on the people who I want to tag
and let me tweet them and uh so that is
what I'm going to do I'm gonna make a
