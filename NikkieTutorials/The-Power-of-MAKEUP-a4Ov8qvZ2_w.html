power of makeup I've been noticing a lot
lately that girls have been almost
ashamed to say that they love makeup
because nowadays we say you love makeup
you either do it because you want to
look good for boys you do it because
you're insecure or you do it because you
don't love yourself I feel like in a way
lately it's almost a crime to love doing
your makeup so after seeing last week's
RuPaul's Drag Race with the half-dragged
half male I was inspired to show you the
power of makeup I noticed a lot that
when I don't wear makeup and I have my
hair up in a bun and I need people and I
show them pictures of my videos or or
whatever looks I have done they look at
me and straight-up tell me that is not
you they tell me that's funny because I
don't even look like that girl on the
picture so with that any further doom
I'm going to do half my face full-on
glam I'm truly going to transform one
side of my face and the other side is
going to be me raw unedited nothing me
just me so let's do it
today I'm first going in with my Kogan
Joe aqua foundation in number 213 it
makes me look photoshopped without
Photoshop that's that's why I love it
same goes for concealer I have dark
circles I want them to be gone
I love browse problem is I don't have
them naturally what is the solution for
that brow pencil
four-eyes I don't like how my eyes are
hooded slightly on the smaller side and
just not as open and awake and fresh so
I like to take a brown eyeshadow and
start building in my crease and most of
the days I don't even follow my natural
crease I just got a little bit above it
and create this new shape so I can
create this I shape or the effect that I
want my eye to give by using makeup here
i'm using anastasia beverly hills
eyeshadow in sun and cognac golds and
taupe eye shadows are my favorite from
the lid so for this transformation I'll
use no other I loved optically making my
eyes look larger so for this I'm taking
my Keaveney tattoo liner in trooper and
creating a new inner corner and creating
a parallel line underneath and leaving
the space in between there
smoke out the lower lash line as smokey
as you want it to be and to open up the
center corners even more I'm taking this
jewel effects and shine by makeup studio
and sparkle it up
and if there's one thing that completely
changes up my eyes its eyeliner and of
course lashes for this amusing the Elena
lashes and these are Bev one of the main
things I get told when I show people a
picture of me with makeup like in my
videos and when I'm without makeup in
front of them in person they always say
but it looks so much slimmer let me
introduce you to the world of contouring
contouring is my religion so today to
sculpt one side of my face I'll be using
the cavity shade and light palette
got a double chin contour that look
at that look at that cheekbones on point
where is the point bronzer because it
gives me the Sun without the damage
Luminoso blush by Milani because it just
transforms my cheeks into heaven and the
bombs mary-lou manizer to highlight her
lips I like lining them today I'm using
boldly bare lip pencil by Mac just to
give the shape of my lips a little bit
more volume then a pinky coral lipstick
this is soft touch by dose of colors and
over top a nude gloss here I'm using the
Rimmel apocalypse lip lacquer in number
100 and that guys is the power of makeup
by no means I want to say that if you
have insecurities so you should just
slap makeup on feel better and just
never be content with your own self I
just want people to know that makeup is
fun and there are no rules to makeup and
if you want to go for that super asked
sharp contour for the day do it if you
want to go for a red lip and crazy
bull's eyes do it there are no rules to
makeup and makeup is there for days when
you want to look hella good and that's
why I love the power of makeup thank you
