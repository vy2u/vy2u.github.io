another tag and this is the princess tag
I've actually not been tagged to do this
but as you know once I feel like doing a
tag I do it just because anybody got
time to be tagged so basically what this
tag is all about is you show your
favorite high-end product and because I
used quite a lot of high-end products I
I couldn't wait to do this tag because I
can actually tell you more about my
favorite high-end products and just I
can talk about high-end products I like
that and by the way this tag is ye-olde
so I don't think I can tag anyone who
hasn't done it yet but get onto it the
first category is foundation and my
favorite high-end foundation is by
Chanel and this is the perfection
Lumiere and I wear the color 12 Bayes
Rose I love this foundation because it
has a medium to full coverage and it's
very buildable so this is great for if
you want to go for a more lighter feel
but you can also really build it up and
make it full coverage I like that it
doesn't have too much excessive shine it
just has the perfect satiny feeling to
it and it's just amazing I'm not someone
to fall in love with a super Dewey
foundations because I feel like they
make you look a little bit sweaty and
this perfection Lumiere by Chanel has
the perfect sort of mix between dewy and
satiny met without making you look oily
and sweaty so as I said it applies like
a dream it stays on like like so well I
think I need my first powder touch-up
after an hour or four or five and I
normally need a powder touch-up after
three hours so that's really good it's a
really great foundation I love it and
check it out for the category concealer
I of course went for the Estee Lauder
Double Wear maximum cover and I'm the
color one and three creamy vanilla I
have this in five I have this in number
seven and I use it on all my models this
covers up any like a humungous
horrendous zit that exists and I can
cover up tattoos it can it basically
covers up anything you want and the best
part of it is that it dries in a sort of
waterproof smudge resistant sort of
sweaty proof sachet
not sashay away Shante you stay so you
do have to work with this quite quickly
because once it dries in and once it
settles it's really hard to move it so
you have to work quickly with it and
then once you've blended it nicely and
it sort of dries and it sets in it
becomes the most amazing formula it
stays on I use this on a photo shoot and
we were outside and my models nose was
getting really red because of the cold I
just dab this concealer on top and you
could not see a thing
so is so you don't see redness with this
you don't see pimples with this you know
it's just Photoshop it's Photoshop in a
little tube I love this concealer so
much the next kind of worry is powder
and you know what's coming this is my
chanel natural finish loose powder in
the number 20 Clair I have no words for
this powder I got this a couple of
months ago and I am absolutely in love
with it it makes your skin look like a
million bucks it just transforms the
skin in a really nice satiny soft shiny
finish without really accentuating like
pimples or anything I heard lots of
great things about the hourglass ambient
light sort of finishing powders but I
heard that they're really glowy almost
at a point that they're too glowy and I
don't like that because I don't want a
powder to mattify me but without looking
like a pancake and what this does this
Chanel's use powder it mattifies used my
face and my models face is but it
doesn't cake up and it just gives that
really nice satin shine and it just
works so amazingly I have no words for
this powder it is expensive but a lot of
product does come in this container so
yeah they come in a bunch of colors and
yeah I love it I love it love it love
the next category is bronzer and for
that I am going to choose a bronzer I
have owned for I think four years I
think I got this in the beginning of
doing professional makeup and hair for
photoshoots and what I'm talking about
is the Lancome star bronzer in number
three and it's no words again um it is a
little bit orange E and it is a little
bit bright but that is exactly what I
want because
when I bronze up a skin on photo shoots
around myself I want it to be um
actually bronzy and I don't want it to
be muddy and sort of grayish and
brownish no and I bronze up a skin I
want you to feel that heat I want you to
feel that summer vibe and I just brush
it some of this Lancome bronzer on the
highest points of the face and I do a
little bit of sculpting with it and it's
so gorgeous and I think I've used it on
like half of all the photo shoots I've
done and look at that there's no pan so
you only need the tiniest bit of this
product and it just gives you that nice
summer glow I love the color they come
in four colors one two three and four
and after four years no pan and I use
this quite a lot so that is amazing to
me I love this bronzer next is blush and
friends I trust my favorite Bobby Brown
blush and this is the blush in pink
coral 31 again this is a product I do
not have words for because it's so
pigmented you only need the tiniest
amount of product it comes in a really
nice matte finish and I just love the
color it's bright it's a little bit in
your face but when you use it the right
way it's absolutely stunning so the next
one it's favorite highlighter and for
that I chose my NARS highlighting powder
in albatross and this is you have to
like this I think you either love this
or hate it because it's a really gold
yellow a shiny highlight but I love it
it's great on fair skin tones it becomes
a little bit too yellow if your deeper
skin tone wise and it's just a really
nice gold like almost true gold
yellowish Sheen and again you do have to
like the color but if you like that sort
of type of magic you will love this for
the category eyeshadow I went for my
bubby Brown rich chocolate palette and
this is my favorite neutral palette
because it just has the most amazing
neutral shades they're not too warm not
too cool toned it comes with an amazing
highlighter shade it has this amazing
warmer Brown a blending color issue
Marie color another shimmery color some
one of them were purpley mixed into
and a really dark color this is my
neutral holy grill palette in my opinion
better than the naked pellets it's
better than the NARS narcissus pellet
it's better than I'd say the a lorac
unzipped palette I haven't tried the
lorac Pro palette yeah but this is my
holy grail neutral eye palette for the
category eye liner I chose my trusty
Makeup Forever aqua liner this is more
of a liquid liner it's not a gel liner
and I'm loving this I bought this in
Paris and ever since I've used it so
many times and it's so amazing it just
applies so nicely and you can really
work with it you can make the like the
sharpest lines with it and it's so black
it's so waterproof smudge proof it's I
love this eye liner for the category
mascara I actually wanted to go for my
makeup studio what a / 3d in X or black
but I don't really consider makeup
studio to be high high-end so I went for
a little bit more expensive mascara this
is by Shiseido and this is the perfect
mascara defining volume and this is a
great mascara for if you have Asian
lashes because I've heard that for Asian
lashes it's the best because Asian
lashes tend to have really short
straight lashes that point down a bit
and with this you can actually get
volume length they stay up it's amazing
and I actually consider myself to have a
bit of an Asian lash because my lashes
are straight they point down they don't
really curl that well before the reveal
lash because I've been using revita lash
now and it has changed my lashes so bail
I mean I love putting on mascara now I
hate it putting on mascara before but
putting on mascara now is just so much
fun because I actually have lashes that
curl that stay up that have legs that
have volume reveal lash is the best sort
of eyelash theorem ever but before I use
revita lash this just a toe mascara was
great because it hold up my curl it gave
me some length it gave me volume and
it's great the next one is a lip liner
and
that you know what I'm going to choose
it's my lip liner by Bobby Brown and
this is pale pink and I use this all the
time I use it almost every day it's just
a perfect color to sort of give your
lips a little bit more volume and a
little bit more body so sort of drawing
a little bit outside your natural lip
line and it's an amazing color an
amazing texture and amazing formula it
stays on really well so the pale pink
Bobby Brown lip liner is the best next
category is lipstick and for this I
chose my ESO la rouge volupte shine in
number 15 and this is actually a color
that I use a lot on a Dutch TV I did
makeup for before I left my agency I did
makeup at mo uni off and that is sort of
a really big fancy edition of Deal or No
Deal and there are girls with the
suitcases with the money in it and I did
makeup on some of those girls and I did
make up a number for suitcase number for
Fleur all the time and this is the lip
color I used on her all the time this is
one of those lipsticks that has an
amazing pop of peach with a little bit
of coral and a little bit of pink so
it's sort of a great natural color but a
little bit more vivid and bright and I
used this on her every week and she
actually got it herself as well because
she loved it so much so great lipstick
the next category is a lip gloss and I'm
actually not a big of a fan of buying
lip glosses separately because I just
don't feel like it's worth the hassle
and the money and just de bucks bucks so
what I'm going to suggest is getting the
Elizabeth Arden 8 hour cream I use this
as a lip gloss you can just dab this
over any lipstick or a lip pencil or
whatever and it just transforms it in a
really juicy nice shiny lip gloss see
look it's amazing plus it's really good
for your lips as well if you have dry
chapped lips this will transform it into
smooth heaven smooth heaven for the next
category its brow product and I actually
find this to be kind of hard for me
because I use eyeshadows for Mac and I
don't consider that to be a real brow
product but if I have to go official and
and you know all that I want to go for
my Anastasia Beverly Hills
brow powder duo in Nashville on taupe
this is if you have my hair color this
is the amazingness powder in the world
so yeah this is a great brow powder duo
it's super pigmented you only need the
tiniest amount of it and in general
Anastasia Beverly Hills has great
products so go check that out
the next one is miscellaneous a candle a
bath goatee tool etc for that let me get
it for that I would say get your shoe
and we're our eyelash curlers these are
the best eyelash curlers on planet earth
on the entire universe like even Sandra
Bullock in gravity knows how good this
is and I think we're going to the last
one yes the last category is nail polish
let me get it my favorite high-end nail
polish brand is Chanel and I have one
favorite color in particular this is
number five to nine graphite and this is
so stunning it looks like a galaxy in a
bottle it has a really nice gunmetal
shiny base but with like green and
champagne glimmer and
and I can't talk anymore
what an amazing nail polish and nail
polishes do tend to chip quite fast so
you need a good top coat with this but
other than other than that it's an
amazing nail polish and yeah the
doesn't get any better so there were all
the categories for this princess tag the
