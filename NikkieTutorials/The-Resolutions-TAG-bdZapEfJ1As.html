ultimate beauty challenge tag and I'm
still waiting for people to do it but I
know that Chloe Murillo and Sheeran
Pharrell are going to do it so that that
made my month because the two of them
are two of my most favorite youtubers on
earth and I just I'm so excited that
they're gonna do the tag so thank you
girls so because of that tag I started
thinking a bit that was really it's sort
of a makeup tag and I also wanted to do
a more talking tag today I came up with
the resolutions tag this is a tag that
you can do every year and you can do
this in like December and January and
eat a little bit into February but it's
sort of for like the end and the
beginning of a year and sort of to
reflect on your year and then look
forward and what's gonna happen so today
I decided to come up with the
resolutions tag and let's go so this tag
consists of ten questions divided into
six and four and six are on looking back
so sort of reflecting the previous year
and four questions are on looking
forward so the first question is name
three things you did this year that
you're proud of I am proud of the fact
that I still have a relationship with my
boyfriend my boyfriend that I got a
relationship with in February so we're
like ten and a half months further now
and we're still in love and I still love
him to death and I'm so proud he's my
first boyfriend ever like a real
relationship a real boyfriend and it's
ten months ten and a half months later
on I'm still like boozing in love I love
him so much he makes me a better person
and I don't really like to talk about
like like boyfriend stuff on the
internet because you never know if
something goes wrong and then you break
up and then you have all these videos
about Tuckahoe and love you are I've
never felt so comfortable and um and
just good with someone I love you so
much another thing that I'm proud of is
that I'm gonna laid out in the open
right here I wanted to quit YouTube like
my schedule whisking yes you're and this
here and then my professional makeup
artist I was getting more hectic and
hectic and I just couldn't deal with
everything all at once anymore a half
fashionista magazine I have so many
things to do and YouTube was getting in
my way I didn't know how to manage to
upload videos anymore
I felt so bad about neglecting you guys
and because of that I started thinking
why not quit altogether just stop
getting their hopes up just stop making
them wait for videos that are not gonna
come and just stop making people waits
at one point I was like I'm gonna delete
my channel I'm just gonna upload a video
saying thank you for all these amazing
years but I can't do it anymore I can't
please you guys anymore then a couple of
weeks ago a good friend now came by
Serena from the ultimate beauty
challenge and we talked and she has a
blog and she came with so many good
advice she came with like tips and
tricks on how you can make a schedule
for yourself and how you can make things
work and I'm happy to tell you that I
will not be quitting YouTube anytime
soon because I loved I love this I love
sitting in my room with my twinkly
background and talking in front of a
camera and having lights shined upon me
I love it I will I just don't want to
stop it and I think I found a way on how
I can go on with YouTube and I think I
can spoil it a little bit already I'm
not just gonna give it away entirely I'm
gonna do that in 2014 but just look at
the dates of my recently uploaded videos
and you will see a pattern so the second
thing I'm really proud of is not
quitting YouTube another thing I'm proud
of is following a hair course and we are
agency I lacked hair skills and I I just
knew I had to be better so I followed a
hair course and I went through I never
gave up never never give up and now
after following the course and finishing
it it's it's an amazing feeling to know
what hair is like how to treat hair how
to style hair how to work with hair it's
it's thank you we are
ceefor just making my life a better hair
place the second question is a name one
thing you wish you had done differently
okay so this is a touchy subject for me
I gained weight and I did not gain a
little bit I gained weight one thing I'm
not proud of and I wish I had done
differently
it's watch my figure a little bit better
it's life is hectic and then you eat
stuff so I'm not proud that I let go of
my eating habits but I'm gonna work on
that okay so the next question I came up
with is what was your biggest highlight
this year my biggest highlight this year
was doing makeup and hair for a TV show
in Holland where I'm actually the head
of the makeup and hair department so
that will air in March I can't wait to
see what they did with it because I've
never been I've been on TV but not like
that
so really excited and I'm just that was
my biggest highlight of the year
question number four what was your
favorite beauty product this year I have
to go for my mac prolongwear concealer I
know big shocker I haven't talked about
it a lot on my channel but it's been
going strong for almost a year now I
wear it every single day if I'm wearing
makeup and I believe it or not I'm not
wearing foundation I am wearing this
concealer only this concealer is
pigmented it stays on like a dream it's
just easy to work with I like the smell
I'd like to formula I like the
consistency I like the colors this is NC
15 but the mac prolongwear concealer
deserves an award
question number five what was your least
favorite product of this year BB Creams
CC creams dd creams ZZ creams BB creams
I hate the BB creams I have had so many
baby creams in my life none of them
worked
I am so hoping that 2014 will be a stop
a stop it right there for BB creams CC
creams dd creams whatever the creams I
am over the BB creams I was over the BB
creams months ago more over it now and
the last question for this segment
looking back is question number 6
and that is who do you want to thank for
being amazing this year my boyfriend or
my mother or my family as a whole or my
dog max but especially my boyfriend and
my mom I just I think I have to go for
my mom because my mom always supports me
and is always there for me and she's so
funny sometimes she loses her memory and
it's so funny it's like mom do you
remember the blah blah blah and it's
just like that ever happens it's amazing
I love my mom and I'm so proud of her
because she has her own beauty salon at
home and that is been doing so well and
she's been doing so good that she could
quit one to one of her three jobs
actually so holy crap mom I'm so proud
of you and Person of the Year is
definitely my mom okay so that was the
looking back segment now let's go to the
other segment which is resolutions so
question number seven is what are the
makeup Beauty resolutions you have for
next year a makeup resolution for next
year is to step away from the Browns and
the Gold's for YouTube because I've been
doing a lot of brown smokey eyes gold
smokey eyes brown smokey eyes and I feel
like all my subscribers and viewers are
like over that we need something new so
a resolution of mine is to play with
more color again because back in the day
my channel is all about extreme and
color and just extreme and then I sort
of graduated to the Browns and a and the
earth tones and now I kind of want to go
back and I know that some of you early
yes some of you are like
question number eight is what are the
fashion resolutions you have for next
year I want to step away from the
leggings stick I am a tall girl I'm six
foot two so finding pants is really hard
for me but now I just kind of substitute
it with black leggings and a short like
hot pants
so you still cover your butt I really
like that style but I've been wearing
that self for a year now and people are
like do you ever wear anything else than
black leggings with hot pants and I'm
like no so a fashion resolution
9 is to step away from the leggings and
hot pants and find something different
Christian number 9 what are your
personal resolutions for next year keep
my boyfriend have last question of this
tags our resolutions Tagus question
number 10 and that is name one thing you
want to check off your bucket list next
year actually one thing I'm definitely
getting off my bucket list next year is
going to London I've been wanting to go
to London for three years I wanted to go
to I meant London and for three years I
had it planned I had it all planned I
the only thing I had to do is book my
flight and my hotel and it just never
happened because something came up and
then something else came up in la blah
blah so next year 2014 London I'm at
London I'm going with Chloe Murillo from
Australia and another thing I want to
get off my bucket list is go to LA
