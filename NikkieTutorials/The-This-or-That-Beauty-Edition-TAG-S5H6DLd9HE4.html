one to do this or that tag I just I saw
this tag going around a couple of weeks
ago and a couple of days ago and
actually I thought at Christmas Star TV
and I just was like since everybody
decided to ignore me with this tag I'm
just gonna do it myself without anyone
tagging me every time I see a new tag
arm around I'm just like hi I'm here ha
no one it's okay it doesn't hurt that
bad so today I'm gonna do these this or
that tag Beauty Edition I don't know if
I had to add the beauty Edition but this
is the beauty Edition so here we go and
before you think like well that is some
kind of slap she Pisa check it you're
wearing it's not because look it has
jewels on it so the first section is
makeup blush or bronzer bronzer because
without bronzer and I look like if I
don't use bronzer I just look like a
dead person and I need that to kind of
contour my faith because if I contour my
face with pink I will look like crap but
if I contour my face with like a bronzer
that is more towards the ashy side I'm
fine lip gloss or lipstick lipstick I
absolutely hate the living guts out of
lip gloss I used to really like lip
gloss but then I just I grew up I became
an adult sort of it's like my hormones
told me like stop the loop plus you hate
it eyeliner or mascara this is a tough
one because I love my eyeliner and I
love my mascara but without mascara I
look like a failed Lady Gaga attempt of
makeup because she always does to
eyeliner without mascara thing and I
really like that but when I do it I just
look like a idiot and I just can't do it
so I think I'm gonna go for mascara
foundation or concealer Oh tough fun
because I love to just put so much on my
face I think I would have to go for
foundation and then double it up under
my eyes neutral or color eye shadow and
I know you all are gonna think that I'm
gonna say color eye shadow but actually
almost
never wear colorful eyeshadow out of the
door like outside the house so I'm gonna
go for natural because I just when I put
natural like a sort of soft smoky eye on
I just feel so damn sexy and brushes or
sponges I'm gonna go for brushes
although I do blend out like blend in my
foundation with a Beauty Blender I put
it on with a brush and blend it in with
a Beauty Blender but I'm gonna go for
brushes definitely brushes ok the next
segment is nails nails OPI or China
Glaze oh that's so mean China Glaze
because I think they have better colors
and OPI is just I love OPI though GOP
long or short no nails I was like what
I'm definitely gonna come for short I
tried the long nail thing I've had the
long nail thing for so long it just
doesn't work when you work in the makeup
industry because everything gets under
it it's gross it's dirty and you just
when you have short nails you can kind
of grab products better and scoop it out
better
so I'm short all the way and I do think
that's more hygienic if you work with a
lot of models so I'm gonna go for like
medium short acrylic or natural natural
all the way I've always hated acrylics
because they just base cream little bit
of yeah to me I've seen some acrylics
where I've been like oh my gosh it is so
gorgeous I want that but most of the
time like nine times out of ten I was
like that is not good brights or dark
rights because when I can't put the
brights on my eyes I'm gonna put it on
my nails so brights definitely flower or
no flower I have no idea what this
person is trying to say with this but I
think no flower because I've never put a
flower on my nail I don't get it next
segment body body stooping body
perfume or body splash perfume lotion or
body butter none because I never use a
lotion er oh I did body butter because I
like the name better body wash or soap
body wash because it's easier to use
lush or other bath company
none because I always get my at the
drugstore
I always thought lush was a candy store
still think it's the candy store so I
don't buy anything there and other like
bath companies we don't have that here
in Holland so I'm just gonna go with
drugstore stuff the next segment is
special okay fashion here we go jeans or
sweatpants I don't fit into jeans
anymore because they're all too short
for me and sweat pants are too short for
me as well but at least they're
comfortable so I'm gonna go for
sweatpants but not outside of the house
because I've never done that before and
I never will because then I feel like
unfinished long sleeve or short I
actually don't have a lot of long sleeve
stuff in my closet
and when I do wear it I just get hot so
easily
I don't like that dresses or skirt that
is so mean that is so sadistic you don't
ask me if I wear dresses or skirts I
gonna no I'm gonna go for dresses
because I wear more tests and skirts
stripes are played stripes flip-flops or
sandals sandals yeah
sandals scarves or hats stars studs or
dangly earrings studs I always wear
studs and the biggest I will go is
probably this and I just don't I don't
like big earrings on me I just feel like
like a 12 year old and I just I don't do
big earrings and when I do I want them
to be like bombastically big necklaces
or bracelets necklaces because bracelets
never fit me because I have huge wrists
cowboy boots are riding boots riding
boots but I never wear any of them so uh
if I had to choose between the two
riding boots but I don't wear them
anyway so riding boots jacket or hoodie
definitely a jacket because jackets make
me look slimmer than hoodies forever 21
or Charlotte Russe we don't have
Charlotte Russe here I've never tried
Charlotte Russe and I love forever 21 so
forever 21 all the freaking way
crumby or Hollister none never been to
any never been to any sex v or Nordstrom
I've been to New York two times out and
I loved Saks 5th it was just I felt like
I was walking like like deluxe heaven
and everything I touched I was like um
touching gold right no I can see it next
segment yeah
curly or straight oh I know I can't
decide because I love both so much these
questions are so mean bun or ponytail
we're both a lot - ponytail yeah
ponytails
bobby pins or butterfly clips what the
hell are butterfly clips hairspray or
gels
long or short well I don't really have
the luxury of having it really long
because my hair this is sort of like its
endgame when it gets longer than this it
just kind of breaks off or just goes
dead I think this is the longest I will
ever get it and I'm kind of okay with
that lengths but it's like a medium so
I'm gonna go with long light or dark
definitely dark side sweet bangs or full
bangs I love full bangs on others hated
on myself though for myself it would go
for side sweet bangs on others full
bangs because it's just so fashionable
and that love that up or down I've had a
period of time where I went up all the
way but now it's down I love down now
because I love down now and the last
segment is random random rain or shine
rain da are they serious with this one
summer or winter summer all the way love
summer some hint hips winter is yeah and
summer is yeah fall or spring ball heart
one because in spring I always wear my
cutesy like floral dresses and in fall I
just look like a like a demonic smokey
eyed biatch the I love bows I'm gonna go
for fall chocolate or vanilla that is so
ah who came up with this chocolate and
the last one east coast or west coast
east because they've only been to New
York and I've never been to like LA and
such so I kind of have to go for like
the east but if I like LA better than
New York then the west but I've never
been there so east for now because I've
only been to New York so that was my
take on the this or that tack I
absolutely loved it they have such heart
