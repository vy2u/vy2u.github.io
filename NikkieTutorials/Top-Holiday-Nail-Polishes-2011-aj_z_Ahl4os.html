though since I've done a video but um it
feels so good to be back and fish you
guys so so so much so much so today I'm
going to show you my top favorite nail
polishes for the holidays you know what
really pisses me off right now I've done
my hair and it looks absolutely amazing
and on camera it looked like crap so
right now I just is just there I hate my
hair so I made the nail wheel with all
the swatches so that way you can
actually see the colors let's start with
number one let's find it the first nail
polish is by China Glaze and this is
called City siren and this is just a
perfect holiday deep blood-red color
this instantly reminds me of vampire's
blood I think this is perfect for
Christmas it's like red but a little bit
more deep and dark for the coffee girls
know just I don't really like a bright
bright bright bright red but I do love
the like dark sultry ones and this one
for that is right here that one then the
second is another red and this is
another China Glaze polish this is
called love Maryland and this is I would
die for this if it was fear factor and
they said eat a spider or you don't get
the Polish I would definitely eat the
spider a tiny one not I do wear it with
a city siren under it as a base because
if you use this alone you can definitely
need like four layers and with city
siren underneath you only need like two
and this is a swatch for love Marilyn
and absolutely amazing glittering red
with silver in it then uh next polish is
another red and this has been my
favorite for years
this is China Glaze Ruby pumps I think
Ruby pumps is one of their best selling
polishes they have and it is right here
on the swatch wheel that one as you can
see just a beautiful sparkling Ruby
pumps
but the next is a really really dark red
this is very soya and this is called Sam
it makes me think of pixie woo this is
your go to dark vampy red color and this
is Sam it's just a really dark red
number five is this D at a Paint Pot
polish and strictly legal and this has
an amazing gorgeous shine to it look at
that it's sort of a spin on that Sam
polish so it's a really dark red it's
kind of more purpley red and it has an
amazing shine to it and a swatch for
that is number five which is that one
and if I move it a bit you see that
shine in it it's really really pretty
okay thanks what I really wanted to show
you it's something really really cool if
I see indie creative creative it is
something they have their normal
polishes and they have effect polishes
and the effect polishes look like this
you have a base color and when you put a
effect on top of it it completely
transforms so let's say if you took a
really really bright hot pink and you
put my favorite because this is my
favorite copper pearl effect on top of
it and I'll let me zoom in for you guys
can you see that pink the copper pink
that is what is going on top of the base
color is absolutely gorgeous and that is
cover pearl then you also have this
really really really cool one this is a
more pinky one and this is called pink
wishes pearl ice watch them over black
for you to really see what they do and
when we look at number six you see the
copper pearl and as you can see it
really just a pink
copper effect to black the number seven
is the pink wishes pearl it's just a
really beautiful purpley color on black
and then this one is by OPI this is
called a designer debitor it's from them
up this collection and I'm actually
wearing it right now I absolutely love
this color it's like a chrome e silver
infuse I just totally threw that so it's
a beautiful like chrome foil silver in
used with orange copper sex in it Oh
now the next one is sort of its brother
this is chanel graffiti and that is the
popular graffiti color um it's sort of a
gunmetal silver it's also kind of
foolish and it's infused with gold and
green shimmer you definitely see that
this Chanel one is a little bit more
boyish and tough then another favorite
that you know I love is the CA another
CJ polish in power dressing my royal
blue I've talked about this in my
previous video this is starlit and in
one line starlit is blue and in one
light starlight is purple and then green
Starla is beautiful and I call this the
Big Brother of her dressing this is
Starla
then the next one is another Chanel
polish this is Billie dawn and I love
this
it's absolutely sex in the bottle this
is a swatch of it it looks like a jewel
to be honest it's just like a jewel on
your hand I love it then the last
greenish color is by so yeah again this
one is called Ivanka and this is just
your typical green it's a little bit
more blue issue though and it has a lot
of glitters and this much of that is
right here that will focus I love this
that makes for going to my favourites
which are the glitters and we're
starting off with Deborah Lippmann this
is one of her famous nail polishes
called
birthday and this looks just like the
OPI one from the Muppets collection and
just do like this one a lot better but
it's just like a party in the bottle so
it's just a really really nice
crazy as mist on your nails which I love
so the next glitter is a really nice
cheap one this is by Milani and it is
called jewel effects and these are like
really big hexagram glitters in silver
these are big chunky glitters again
beautiful new for New Year's Eve it's
just
glitter to the max then the last glitter
but definitely not least is by China
Glaze and this is called snow globe and
this is amazing over white on the swatch
wheel I put it on its own again but it
is absolutely so so special and then the
last last one is a glitter as well this
is so yeah Roxy
now this is a stunner um it's dark it's
vampy but it's bright and it's cool as
well so yeah guys those are all my
favorite holiday polishes of this season
so if you can see I love my dark vampy
colors I love my bats I love my greens
but I don't really do love the glitters
as well everything is available online
