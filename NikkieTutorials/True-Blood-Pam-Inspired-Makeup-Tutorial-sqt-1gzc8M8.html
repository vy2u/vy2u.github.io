tutorial that I've been wanting to you
for five years now since true block came
out I was a big fan and I always wanted
to do a true love tutorial makeup
tutorial but their makeup was every
season it was like it was cool itself
but not like makeup tutorial worthy so
then two weeks ago cam was wearing a
super cool silver smokey eye with like
these bright orange red lips and I
absolutely love Pam so today I am going
to do a Pam inspired True Blood makeup
tutorial it's a bit much it's a bit drag
--is-- it's a bit Pam with a hint of
love again I just really really love
this so um if you want to know how to
get these really cool smoky silver and
the bright red lips and then please keep
on watching
so the first thing you want to do is to
play a bass to your auto it's to prevent
your eyeshadow from creasing and the one
I'm using is my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot
we're going to start off with defining
the crease of it with two darker grayish
colors this is max mr. e and this is
print and I'm going to mix the two
together and I'm mixing a bit of makeup
these unexpected eyeshadow in the mix
because it will make it a bit lighter
and I'm just really gonna start defining
my outer corner of my crease with that
and slightly going further in then I'm
gonna start blending those along my
lower lash line as well to know where we
want to go to with our shape you're
gonna go up following your waterline and
this will determine the shape of the
entire eye look then from the point go
back into your crease and this is your
new starting point for your crease
taking a bit of next copper plate and
makeup geeks latte I'm going to continue
blending the crease out with the really
soft blending motions and the more you
go in the lighter your strokes are going
to be the lighter your payoff is going
to be but the big fluffy blending brush
and blending it out even more you really
want this Cruise to be as blended and
perfect as possible I'm going to take a
black I call this is illamasqua selfie
and with that I am going to line my
upper lid
and then just start blending that line
out to make it a nice smoky black line
with the outer part I'm kind of going to
wing that out into that point of my
crease and this blue for the little but
we use they make up beats booing I shout
out and just pack that on to the lid
over to black for the first part and
once you reach the middle you kind of
want to go above the black liner taking
just a matte black eyeshadow I am going
to smoke that along the lash line just
like we did with the eyeliner but now
with an eye shadow it's a kind of read
Arkin that line right here and again I'm
kind of going to that outer V again with
the black to make it a nice eye shape as
the brow bone highlight i will be using
Mac's
chamomile eyeshadow and with that you
can really blend your crease even more
I'm making it look even more perfect
after that just take your blending brush
again and just make sure that that
crease it's perfectly blended I'm almost
not touching my skin but I'm still just
like blending out the edges to make it a
perfect blend reapplying a little bit of
that bling eyeshadow by make a peak onto
the lid because you really want that to
be blingy just like the name for the
bottom lid I'm taking mr. egan and a
little teeny tiny bit of makeup geeks a
lot a really darkening B lower lash line
with that I'm blending it a bit down
taking my black again and darkening that
up even more you want your water like to
be as black as possible for that I'm
using my Urban Decay 24/7 glide-on eye
pencil in zero
as an inner corner highlight I'm taking
the Sigma highlighting pencil from their
new perfect browsed kit and this will be
launched on the 23rd of July let's set
that with a bit of the bullying
eyeshadow again I'm gonna take a bit of
my OCC concealer and I really really
love this one and I'm just gonna clean
up under my eyes a bit and make that
bottom shape really work okay what I'm
now gonna do is curl my lashes in a
place of a Skara the mascara I will be
using is by makeup studio in this system
what approved 3dx or black and I used it
every single day and it's my favorite
bag for false lashes because she
definitely need false lashes I mean Pam
without false lashes is like Pam with
her face rotting off no even then she's
wearing false lashes so ones I'm using
are bad miss adore oh and these are the
number 82
so from its I decided to go with max a
lady danger lipstick and it might be a
little bit too orange for a little of
that she was wearing in episode number
five but I don't really mind I love me
some orange red so you can also go for a
bright pink that is what she was wearing
in episode number four with these eyes
exactly the same so it's just it's a
really fun smoky look and you can like
put whatever kind of lipstick color you
want with it you could go nude you do
anything you like I always love when you
reach that point you look like you have
a massage hello
so I chose to do my cheeks after lips
because the color of the lips is pretty
damn out there so I kind of wanted to
see what it did with the face like color
wise and all that stuff I read a contour
my face a bit with NYX blush taupe now
I'm going to warm up my face a little
bit more with illamasqua disobey powder
blush warm of my face a bit then as a
blush I would like to keep it a little
bit more natural but Pam in True Blood
had like a fiery bright pink blush on
I'm not brave enough for that right now
so I'm gonna make a mixture between
Mac's pink tea and a bit of dumb ding
again and apply those to the apples of
my cheeks and then of course you guys
know that I love highlighter the more
highlighter the better so I'm gonna take
my Mac suburb extra dimension skin
finish and just give me that million
dollar bucks glow so yeah guys that
completes my pen from True Blood Season
5 inspired makeup tutorial I must say I
am so happy I finally did a true but
look because I've been wanting to do
true but for so long but their makeup
