tutorial on this is it Halloween look
right here honestly I don't know how we
ended up here but we ended up here so it
basically all started with these right
here these are the face lace by sillas
cotton and these are what they call
holographic stickers holographic makeup
stickers so these are for decoration I
also have a sheet here for holographic
liner bo listen if there's one thing
simply illogical taught us this is not
hollow this right here it's iridescent
unicorn poop so these stickers are here
initially inspired me to do a
holographic iridescent unicorn fairy
look and then the stars happened and
then the wig happened and I don't know
how we ended up here but we are here
without any further ado let's go right
on to this tutorial and let's paint and
have some fun sit back and enjoy the
stupid school brushes are pretty just
artifice like I'm going to be taking
this warm tone purple mixed in with the
cool tone purple right next to it it
will be focusing this definition on the
outer parts of my eye and also dragging
it into the crease
now for definition on the inner part of
my crease I'm going to go in with this
oldish pinkish color here and on a
Brazilian tools 776 brush I'm just
deciding it slightly now as you can see
the edges are a total mess we cannot
live with this let's fix it going in
with a clean blending brush and just
wiggling my brush right at the edge
where the eyeshadow stops and just like
magic it will smooth it out
all right cleaning that edge up using a
little bit of concealer I feel like once
you have cleaned up that side it really
shows you where you still need a little
bit of blending for me that's right
there time for one of my favorite things
to do when doing my makeup
cutting the lid using select cover up
concealer by Mac I like with most of my
looks I go a little above my natural
crease to show the look even when I look
straight forward with my hooded eyes
and sitting that lit using fossil from
the juvie s place magic palette smudging
some of that purple closer to my
lashline for the lower lash line I'm
going back in with those same vibrant
purples and from outer to inner corner
we're just going to smoke it out and now
darkening the outer third of both my top
and lower lid with some black I think
we're going to curl my lashes and put
some mascara on and some falsies and
then we'll have fun and the falsies
amazing today are by an etude and they
are called fairy
alright lashes on now this is where the
trouble starts now here are they what
they call holographic stickers they're
more like an iridescent unicorn boss but
like okay and their line and my number
one problem with these is that these are
so sticky that they will not get off
your tweezers so I experimented a little
bit on the other eye and what works best
is putting down a little bit of lash
glue first so it actually has something
to stick onto you to kind of grab it
from the tweezer and that way it will
stick on but take your time for this
it's hard so I'm going to be starting
off with this one in the center for my
inner corner go see
oh no sis I feel like the inner core no
one makes such statements where a simple
brown smoky eye and Pops's on that inner
corner and Kabam you seal the show all
right the longer one is going in my
crease please stay oh all right so it is
definitely a struggle to get these on so
baby once they're on holy crap all right
time for the face I know this is a
really boring step but a necessary step
bronzer and we're going to be creating
like this mystical mythical mystical I
don't know this fairy-like haze with a
glow and blush the first bronzer
for blush you're not going to go in with
the honest cause their blush trio in
pink passion and just mixing the colors
and kind of like a haze around the eyes
I'm going to add some pink
all right so now that it is kind of like
a haze around the eyes it's time to glow
so I'm going to go in with the Kat Von D
alchemists holographic highlighter
palette and I'll be going in with this
color first which is called pink opal
alright so we've got these really
unicorny fairy cheeks going on so let's
focus on the lips and wrap this look up
because it's 5:00 in the morning I'll be
going in with this Kat Von D liquid
lipstick in oh god muñeca Lemonnier cos
moon Yakka when Yaga
booyaka booyaka yeah
and going over top with some of these
duochrome e shadows okay honestly don't
know where I'm going with this look
right now but it feels kind of good so I
just can't stop
I think I'm done and that guy's
concludes this I don't even know what to
call this fairy unicorn oil slick
holographic liner look what I do know is
that it is now 4:43 in the morning I am
really tired but I have so much fun this
is what I love about makeup you can
