my channel to talk about the following
Little Mix is the best band with the
best makeup of life who just wanted to
get that out there just before we
started today I was vastly inspired by
Perrie Edwards once again loves this
woman and she was rocking a pink and
black cartoon liner done by her makeup
artist Adam Burrell and I am obsessed I
do not have the eyes for this I have
hooded eyes when you hear cartoon liner
and hooded eyes you wouldn't really mix
that together but you know what makeups
got no rules no matter what kind of
shape of eyes you have if you love
makeup
you should just apply to your face your
eyes to whatever you want to apply your
makeup and enjoy the process of it and
just enjoy the transformation so even
though I have hooded eyes today we're
going to be trying the cartoon aligner
trend so without any further ado if you
would like to know how to get this
Perrie Edwards cartoon liner inspired
makeup tutorial then keep on watching
all right so the first thing I'm going
to be doing is priming my face although
all the attention is going to go to the
cartoon liner you fill in your base to
be perfect so first I'm going to go in
with this farce Ollie unicorn essence
oil and literally everyone on instagram
and goes like yeah buddy
literally everyone on Instagram uses
this in a very sexual way and I want to
say for myself is it actually works it
actually does something to make your
makeup last longer or if it applies to
more beautiful so let's do it
so hot so sexual I got a lot of good or
rotten Oh another smell Charlie nose
smells candy it has a nice moisturizing
feeling that is slightly tacky but like
I feel like the skin really absorbs it
usually when I apply oils they really
stay on top of my skin and don't really
sink in so as soon as I go in with
foundation it just it's it doesn't mix
well and like it goes on streaky and I
feel like the oil is blocking the
foundation from sitting really nicely on
the skin or with this one the unicorn
since I feel like it's almost gone so we
shall see for foundation I know I am so
boring Lancome Holy Grail and applying
it today using a morphe sponge yes
coverage oh my god this coverage is
unreal so for everyone who is new here
hi my name is Nikki and I am obsessed
with full coverage foundation it's the
best I don't know if it's because it's
up first all the oil but like it looks
really nicely blended in my skills like
a million books and I don't know if it's
because of the oils that it made it go
I'm really smoothly and nice but I am
like I wouldn't see you for concealer
you go in with an oldie but a goodie be
it cosmetics bye bye under eye and
blending that in using my morphe sponge
again
and I'm going to set my under eyes with
powder to prevent it from creasing and
to highlight the first shot I will be
working with today is nylon by Mac and
I'm going to highlight my brow bone and
inner corners with this and since there
is little to no eye shadow work in this
look you really want to be lined that
brow bone and inner corner go in with
this tart clay play palette and taking
the lightest color called solstice and
on a Mac 252 I'm just setting the entire
eye area and I'm blending in the edges
with the shimmery nylon color and on a
blending brush I'm just diffusing a
little bit of my contour shade into the
side of my crease for the tiniest bit of
definition I'm going to go in with the
NYX vivid bright slit liner in the color
vivid petal and this is going to be the
base but this can be any color you like
if you want yellow blue green orange
whatever do what you like
now very carefully tracing the outside
of the pink using this blank ultra-thin
liquid eyeliner pen this is really thin
and precise but go ahead and take your
time for this and little by little I add
strokes around the pink and the best
advice I can give you for this look is
take your time work in stages and just
trust yourself
so we kind of have like the general out
right now and now is when you want to
perfect the thickness and then go back
in with the pink to sharpen up
like that and I am pretty damn proud of
this I have hooded eyelid so as soon as
I look straight forth
see how my hooded crease is forcing this
line down that is just my anatomy you
know with every liner out there doesn't
matter if you're doing a cartoon liner
or just winged eyeliner there is a point
where you should look at your creation
and be like this is the best I can do
for now i'ma move on and I'm at that
point right now going back into that
Tarte palette and taking the color stone
and dunes four on the lower lash line
and applying these two colors on a small
detail dubious place brush and bringing
the color about halfway in and on of the
Ray Morris number nine brush I'm going
to smoke that out oh god I love having
hooded eyes look come on come on for the
waterline I'll be going in with this
Marc Jacobs liner in pink of me okay
time to wrap up these are the any tooth
fairy lashes so pretty
sorry went ahead and started Brogdon up
this ghostly face and I'm doing so using
my hull alight by benefit and the hula
brush every video I do this I try to
like change it up a little bit but it's
just my Holy Grail browsing routine that
it's really hard for me to like break
that routine this ys4 head could use a
little bit of lovin at the same shade of
contouring that I used in my crease also
now apply to the cheekbones not a job I
bet this right here baby is face to
reshape in the brush now that'll go in
with the most soft blush of life this is
pink tea by Mac and it looks like
nothing in the pan but on the skin it
just reacts in a really nice way it just
looks naturally bomb on the skin see the
hint of pink for highlighter today she
is there
Oh baby how I've missed you I forced
myself she is new and different
highlighters for at least three four
videos but it's gotta go back to my baby
I created her I'm her mom so I'm gonna
go in with my ever glow highlighter bio
frustrated sis and I'm gonna go in with
the lightest color too you know swiftly
blind everyone on my Ray Morris number
two brush my favorite highlighting brush
of the moment
so we'll say the goat of the
highlighters the goat all right for lips
I'm now going to go in with this Mac
liquid lipstick this is in the color so
me
and this morphia liquid lipstick and
Sasha going right on the center okay
that is almost the exact same color and
I thought it was way lighter
now let's seal the deal using some
setting spray I'm going to be using the
milk solar spray which is an invisible
match makeup setting spray and that
guard please close this tutorial on
