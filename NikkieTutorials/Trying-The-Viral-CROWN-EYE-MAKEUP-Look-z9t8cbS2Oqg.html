tutorial something new on my channel
here I've been seeing this crown I
makeup look going really viral on
Instagram lately and I am obsessed and I
know a lot of people have done
recreations of this and the genius that
started this trend off is Marissa
Melbourne and she actually did a
tutorial on this look herself so it was
really helpful to actually know what you
helped by the creator of this all but
the reason I am calling this a try out
like trying this makeup look is because
I had no idea what the hell I was doing
I mean I never practiced this look I had
no idea what I was doing so I couldn't
really be like well now guys we're going
to do this and this and it works like
this in this I have no idea what I was
doing so it was really hard for me to
explain I know this isn't the most
natural everyday kind of look but
actually you know what screw that I'm a
queen and people may seat up on my
eyeballs nan every day my ass I want to
wear this every day for the rest of my
life so yeah I really tried here I feel
like a queen let's all feel like Queens
and let's get this video oh my god oh I
can do this I can do this
the first product I'm going in with is
by Mac this is soft ochre Paint Pot and
don't judge me alright now going into
the hooded Beauty rose gold eyeshadow
palette and taking the color shy for in
my crease and we're just using this as a
transition color so make sure you blend
and blow that out like a queen
from Suva beauty I'm now picking up this
maroonish purplish shade I have a no
idea what this is called but I'll put it
down below and this is going more into
the crease to deepen and give more depth
now this is such a beautiful color from
the crease I'm upset and then going back
in with my arc 40 by morphe and just
blending the edges not taking hooda
beauty's bossy eyeshadow and this is
going all over the lid blending into
that beautiful crease and using a morphe
e36 I'm also smoking bossy on the lower
lash line
and then with a bdellium tools brush in
number five for two I'm extending and
creating a new inner corner
and then now it's time for the fun part
the crow now with max select cover up in
nw15 I'm going to cut out where I want
my crown to be and for this I'm using an
Anasazi burbly Hills to wish brush and
it's super important to take your time
for this
I'm going to go for 6 crown points so
kind of space them out nicely so we have
room for crystals and jewels but you can
do however many points in the crown you
want and I'm focusing on the outline fur
and then I'll fill in after but they're
just focusing on the on the tips of the
crown
alright now let's now fill it all in
now I'm taking makeup geeks hot pants
eyes shadow and setting most of the
concealer of course you cannot reach the
ultimate tip of the crown but we're
covering that up with glitter later on
for glitter I'll be using this one by
certify and of course you need a base
for that and as my base I'll be using
the beauty bakery sparkles glue and this
is a very tedious job first what I'm
doing is covering the tips of the crown
using the glitter glue and immediately
after setting with the glitter
and now covering the remaining part of
my lid with glue and following with the
glitter and now let's take our crown to
the next level by jeweler rising is that
a word by adding some jewels to it so
I'm going to add a small pink ones to
the tips of my crown and bigger orange
gold ones right in between and I'm using
this handy little tool called the
crystal katana
to pick up the rhinestones with this
side right here and my nail artist uses
this and it just picks it up right away
without any hassle but first plopping
with some glue where we want the jewels
to go
oh pretty but I feel like these aren't
blinding enough so I'm going to coat
them with a little bit of white
and then right in between big ol orange
one and to spice up my inner corners I'm
adding a couple of dots to my new inner
corner now all I need is some lashes
these are the cases Beauty lion-hearted
by my best friend Kim Chi are you say hi
are you my queen
all right so we got the curls on our
eyes I feel magnificent so now it's time
to give our face a little bit of lovin
so I'm going to warm and bronzed I'm
using benefits hoola in light and I'm
using my morphe m4 and no skip that the
morphe m14 3 this is my favorite brush
to bronze and contour with so I'm going
to load it up with blue LA so I'm just
going to start warming up my face
are we really loving this I'm like I'm
feeling so warm and summery with it and
I never wear bronzer so it's it's a good
feeling and this literally smells so
good I cannot deal it's insane
okay a little trick I did because I like
the light on your eyes but sometimes
it's a little bit too much like going
with my bronzer a little to kind of warm
it all up so sometimes it's too much set
me the most unnatural bitch on YouTube a
little bit of forehead just a little bit
get that sunshine all right and then you
can stop there but I'm going in with a
little bit of contour because I'm not
being a queen but my kicks don't look
like acquainting so with that I mean
high up and powerful so we're gonna
cause my cheeks to make them look higher
up and powerful I know I'm getting super
super boring blush wise but like this
covergirl one has been it's just been
you know hitting all the right spots for
me it's going to pick it up with a more
feet
five and just more on the outside of my
sheep I'm just going to add a tiny bit
of warmth but nothing too much can you
see how it's a barely there blush but
like it's barely there but it does
something and that's when people's
exactly what a woman let this blush for
my highlight today I'm going to go in
with ever glow 9 days until this
launches my collaboration with Oprah
cosmetics them so oh so excited alrighty
and then further list was my favorite
nude nude potion I am telling you guys
I'm so excited and thankful for the
amazing response to my collaboration
announcement with Oprah cosmetics like
your love and support like it made my
year like you guys were so supportive
you loved the colors you cannot wait to
blind with ever glow and it means so
much and I just want to say thank you
and then I must be honest my lips feel a
little bit left out with all this going
on on the eyes so I'm going to top my
lip off using the lip topper buns away
called frostbite so now all that is left
to do is set our face using some setting
spray and I have this new one here and a
lot of you asked me to try it out this
is my cover effects this is called the
illuminating setting spray now what this
is is it's a setting spray with
illuminating particles in it so what
this will do is make you look even more
glue and a lot of you have been asking
me if I like this I do not know I'm
going to try it out for the first time
right here right now so let's see Oh
misty oh my god the mist is so fine I
barely feel it on my face I don't know
when to stop now I feel nothing it's not
even wet is there change am i more glowy
oh my god you barely feel it on the skin
of anything happening I feel like it
added a soft luminous touch I might be
seeing things this might be my mind
playing with me but like yeah so I
definitely feel like my face is a lot
more radiant and like healthy look and
that guys concludes this me trying the
crown makeup look that has been very
