turquoise with gold stone meals tutorial
for y'all I came across a super cool
photo of this mani on the internet
recently so today I decided to try it
out and recreate it so without any
further ado let's just get right at it
I already primed my nails using a nail
hardener I'm now going to apply a base
coat to make this many less as the long
as possible
now take your favorite turquoise nail
polish now I didn't know this but it's
actually quite hard to find the perfect
one this one right here the first one is
to Mantee and to green so that's a no-no
the third one right here is to blue into
dark you really want to find something
that's right in between so on the middle
we have our winner the perfect turquoise
color for this mani now just go ahead
and apply to post to each nail
you want to make sure this is as dry as
possible you will see why in a bit now
comes the fun part take your little
plastic bag and kind of squish it
together and make some wrinkles and
dents into it but just keep in mind that
it shouldn't be too precise and perfect
have you ever looked at a turquoise
stone and where the dents and all the
things like precisely and perfect place
on it no okay now put the gold nail
polish onto that plastic back with all
the dents and wrinkles into it that you
made and dab it a couple times onto that
white paper this way you won't have like
thick gold blobs on your nails
now dab the plastic back with a gold
polish onto your nails now this is why
your nail polish should be dry if it's
not dry you will end up with dents and
like creases in your nail polish and
it's just not pretty and that's it
finish up with your favorite top coat to
make this many less for days and that
was it guys super easy right if you end
up trying this mani please tweet it to
me at nikkietutorials
thank you guys so much for watching and
hopefully I will see you guys next time
bye guys mwah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
