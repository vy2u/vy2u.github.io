look that I like to call the Safari
twisted it sort of in spell I got this
necklace from jewel mean I know
gentleman is a really touchy subject on
YouTube because people are like oh my
god Jimin send it to you now I hate you
god damn
I took videos with jewel men before and
everyone was ok with it like what's the
problem now so a couple of weeks ago
jewel men send me an email again asking
if I wanted to have a new necklace or a
ring or bracelet or whatever they sell
and I was like duh of course so I chose
this urban Safari necklace and it's the
embrace your Wilder side with our
version of a high fashion adventure once
a trend and forever a staple Safari chic
has reappeared on the runways I chose
this urban Safari Nicholas my gentleman
I absolutely love it and I'm noting that
because they make me say anyways go
ahead and check out the link down below
to send yourself up for a jewel omen if
you want to sign up for it I believe
it's $30 where was I I got this necklace
and I was so inspired by the name
actually urban Safari so I decided to do
a look inspired by going into a jungle
or going on a safari and having this
tropical cool I look if you want to know
how I did this then please keep on
watching so the first thing you want to
do is the PI 8 base to your eyelids to
prevent this eyeshadow from creasing and
the one I'm using is my soft ochre Mac
Paint Pot the first thing I'm going to
do is to apply some definition into my
crease with Mac's sketch and I'm just
going to define that outer part of my
crease then softly I'm going to further
blend it into my crease now going to
make a mixture between mex texture
eyeshadow and soba the my gonna blend
those two right here in that line of my
no sign sort of so really here on the
inner part and that will give
an amazing sort of fashion feeling and
then once you've got that then blend it
further into your crease again take it
over the next Foley eyeshadow I'm
further going to define that outer part
of my crease and blended inwards going
back into sketch I'm going to make a
start point for my eyeliner and I'm
gonna wing that out and now just use
sketch as an eyeliner along your lash
line
then of course fill that in and then
from that outer point go into your
crease and make that darker go ahead and
darken this complete outer third part
and really darken it up and blend it
into the lid and then I'm gonna go back
into my texture and my soba and just
start blending the edges really nicely
for my lid I'm not taking my NYX jumbo
pencil in milk placing that onto the lid
where I want my pigment to go to and
then of course blend it in the penguin
I'm going to use is by Inglot and this
is number 84 and it has a beautiful
green duochrome
and I'm just placing that all over my
lid where the white from the NYX jumbo
pencil is as well okay now I'm gonna
redefine that outer part a bit more
because I feel like I blend it most of
it away with my new Inglot pigment I'm
quickly gonna highlight my brow bone
with Mac's chamomile eyeshadow I'm not
going to take this gorgeous Catrice
eyeshadow and the name of this is talk
like an Egyptian and I absolutely love
this I bought this for my 20 dollar
makeup challenge video and I've been
using it so much ever since I love this
so what I'm gonna do with that color is
place it right here on the very inner
corner and then blend it into that
Inglot pigment right here for my lower
lash line I'm gonna make a mixture
between sugar pills poison plum and face
friends gumball I am going to run this
along right lower lash line just the
middle and then blend it down a bit I am
going to make a line going
in Word and then go back and also with
poison plum I'm going to make that
second eyeliner just like that there for
my green inner corners I will be using
this color star liquid liner in number
24 I'm just gonna fill in that part
right here so we left open with the
purple and then I'm also kind of gonna
make a wing in it and then really softly
blend some purple underneath that a
little bit more I gotta take a bit of my
favorite OCC concealer and I'm just
gonna clean up under my eyes to make the
shape work and make everything look
perfect
for my waterline I'm going to use the
bed net neutralizer cream crayon in
light mp2 and for my mascara I am using
my favorite what a prude 3d extra black
by makeup studio so I'm gonna do that
right now and then it will be back so
for my cheeks I first started contouring
with my NYX toe blush and I warmed it up
a little bit more with I can open it and
I warmed it a little bit more with LM s
cos dis ablai blush just in the mix then
to give my face a really nice warm glow
I used the Illamasqua bronzing duo in
glint and risk or Raisa
right to hug Rissa ha wrist huh right
huh I don't know and then of course as a
highlight you know it's my Mac extra
dimension skin finish in whisper of
guilt formulas I didn't want to go too
bright or too extreme because I really
feel like when you're in a safari you're
not wearing like bright red or pink lips
not that you will be wearing this either
but you get it first gonna blank them
out a bit with my Mac lip erasing pill
then I'm topping on that Python color
crushed it lipstick by Mac and then on
top of that for a little bit of gloss I
am going to use the Mac Resort life lip
jelly and this is from their Disney
Villains collection from a long long
long time ago and I'm only gonna apply
this to like the center of my bottom lip
oh I hate with glasses and lip jellies
and stuff because they're always so
sticky
so you know that completes this Safari
twisted inspired makeup tutorial all
inspired by the urban Safari jewel mint
necklace that I'm wearing right now I
absolutely love it so you think I got so
