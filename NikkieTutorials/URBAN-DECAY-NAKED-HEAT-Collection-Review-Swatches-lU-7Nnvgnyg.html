review slash demo Szechuan splash first
impression on the highly criticized
already naked heat collection by Urban
Decay so much has been said about this
collection and people were saying that
the presentation was off and that was
just a horrible palette we've already
seen so many warm tones out there why is
there more and you know makeup is such a
personal opinion it's such a personal
thing something that I love in a shadow
and look for in a shadow might be
something that you hate in a shadow so
that makes makeup really really personal
I always feel like you got to try it out
for yourself to see if you like it or
not so that is exactly what I'm doing in
today's video today's video is going to
be a little bit of playtime using the
naked heat palette plus two liners and
the lipstick and we're just going to see
what the pigmentation is like on me does
it blend out easily
how are the lipsticks how are the liners
we're just going to have a little bit of
fun and play time and see what this
collection is all about alright first
I'm going to go in with the color
Cayenne and this is going on my inner
and outer corner and then blend it out
and in doing this using a makeup Shack
brush
so now the colors just kind of there the
messy Queen we want to blend this out
but can we just say whoa pigment so on a
clean Oh 421 brush which is a clean
blending brush I'm going to now blend
out the edges now I'm going to be mixing
the colors chaser and soft and I'm going
a little bit above where I placed
cayenne for a nice transition and I'm
doing this because I want the overall
warmth and shape of the eye to go a
little bit higher up but I don't want it
to be as intense as with Cayenne so I'm
doing it with softer color and also
slightly placing some of that in the
center of the crease time to really turn
up the smoke going in with ashes and
darkening the inner and outer corners
even more and doing so on a very
detailed blender brush by Julius place
and especially when working with such a
dark color here on the inner corners I'm
barely touching my skin the product is
very landing on my eye so it gets a
really smooth and soft application for
the center feel that I'm going to be
going in with scorched and a tiny bit of
dirty talk
and again I'm playing with super
pigmentation here there's a tiny bit of
fallout going on but this is what I
expect with super shimmery shadows like
these and you literally brush the
fallout away in two seconds so I am
really pleased with that the waterline
I'll be applying the 24/7 glide-on eye
pencil in alkaline and even dragging it
a little bit on to the roots of my lower
lashes to blend it out later and
surprisingly this pencil is a lot more
purple than I expected
it doesn't matter we're now going to
blend it out with a really tiny brush
picking up ashes and on and swea go oh
my god this is so hard and Fuego
together and smoking the lower-left-hand
out with those and I'm really turning up
the smoke with this dark lower lashline
to spice up that inner corner and going
in with dirty talk and just putting it
right there to create sort of a new
inner corner like I always do and to
finish a little highlighter on the inner
inner corner and to finish I'll be
applying the illamasqua visage lashes
Michelle visage ah I love these ashes so
much
all right let's focus on the cheeks
before we go in with the lips first of
the bronze using this never use this
just watched it this is my hourglass the
ambient diffused bronze light so I've
never tried this please be good to me
it's a little bit more red tone it's a
little bit more red toned than the
benefit hoola light but I'm not mad at
it if you're looking for a bronzer that
isn't through that light and is a little
bit more red toned
try this one for blush I'm gonna go in
with x-rated by Kylie cosmetics focusing
this more towards the side of my face
higher up so instead of the apples more
backward and for highlight today I'm
gonna go in with this Illamasqua one Oh
do you see what is happening on your
screen right now this is insane and this
highlighter is called oh my god oMG very
sitting I going in with my current
favorite highlighting brush my Ray
Morris number two oh no come on show up
oh no come on come on
we're all rooting for you come on we
were all rooting for you all right going
in with the BH spotlight highlight
palette this color right here it's been
tickling all the good parts
fur lips from the three new launches in
this collection I'm going to go with
fuel but I do want to mention that heat
is my absolute favorite color of the
entire lip collection he's like a
metallic warm copper it is so beautiful
but I feel like with these eyes is going
to be too much too much I know this
first coming out of my mouth never heard
of but I feel like with this look it's
going to be too much and too fallish and
we are in summer so let's keep it more
in the heat hot the heat naked so going
in with fuel pigmentation
and I do want to add a little bit of
pizzazz to this lips I'm going to go in
with this gloss buys you a this is a lip
hopper in San Tropez and of course to
seal the deal some setting spray and
that guys concludes my playtime with the
new Urban Decay Naked heat palette plus
the lipsticks and the eyeliners and
overall I think this is so worth it you
know half these colors been done
absolutely can you find cheaper
alternatives to this palette absolutely
3500 by morphe easy I think first of all
the packaging is insanely stunning I'm
obsessed with it this also by far is my
personal favorite Naked palette out
there because it's got its warm colors
I'm all about the warm colors if I could
wear a warm tone list for the rest of my
life I would be a-okay with that so of
course I'm going to love this
I think the quality of the shadows are
very very impressive the maps have a
rich pigmentation they go on like buttah
they blend out really easily using that
clean brush technique that I taught you
and overall I think the shadows are
really really good I feel like the
shimmer shades do come out best with a
little bit of a thicker base underneath
to really make them go pal and the only
fallout I have noticed so far is what
the shimmery shades but that is to be
expected when they are so highly
concentrated in pigment so overall the
quality of the shadows insane the
packaging is a total win for me so do I
recommend this palette I absolutely do I
just personally know I can tell that
when I first go in with the shadows to
say with the dubious palettes I feel
that I'm going to use this more often I
don't know how many times that I feel
like this is going to become a staple in
my collection the three lipsticks I'm
also highly impressed by I love the
colors the metallics can't go on a
little bit streaky but I recommend
applying one layer than blotting
applying a second layer and you should
be a pink and ready to
and last but not least the liner's also
love this formula I've always been a fan
of the 24-hour glide on pencils because
they actually stay on and I think these
two colors are perfect so even though
this launch has gotten quite a bit of
criticism I of a stay I'm a fan I am NOT
sponsored or paid to say that you could
see the pigment for yourself you could
see how all the products played for
itself and I am a fan now like I said if
you think this is too much for the naked
palette you can go to morphe save a lot
of money but in the end it is the brand
and the packaging that you're paying
extra for and it's up to you if you're
willing to do so so by all means go find
this palette in a store swatch it for
yourself play with it for yourself and
make up your own decisions and I'm just
sharing mine other than that that wraps
