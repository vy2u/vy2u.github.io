impressions slash demo on this beauty
right here urban decay recently
announced that they will be releasing a
naked ultimate basics eye shadow palette
now I'm not gonna lie when I saw this I
kind of lost my shade because I am such
a sucker for neutrals like anything
neutrals especially warm neutrals like
doo-doo-doo so when I saw that they were
coming up with this I was so excited to
buy one for myself and to try it out and
to let you know here on my channel what
I think of it but this morning I opened
my door and my mailman was like urban
decay so first and foremost I want to
thank Orban in case so much for sending
this out and letting me try this I think
it's so so cool when brands
let me try their products I also kind of
feel like I look like a doctor
hello ma'am glam problems I can help
anyways so we're talking about this
beauty right here the Urban Decay Naked
ultimate basics palette and it looks
like this first of all I think the
packaging on this is absolutely insane
this is that type of packaging where you
just feel like it's such a luxurious
amazing product and because it's a
neutral palette you want the packaging
to kind of lure you in there are so many
neutral shadow palettes out there that
when a palette has amazing packaging
like this it kind of helps me pick that
team faster than the other one with
their sucky packaging now on the inside
we find a very high quality good mirror
this is like a true top-quality mirror
where you can actually do your makeup
with on the inside we find 12 brand new
eyeshadows these are eyeshadows that are
brand-new for this palette only they
cannot be found anywhere else in any
other palettes or Urban Decay or as
singles on the top row we can see more
pinky Mavi dusty pink like purpley
shades and on the bottom row we find
warm Browns a gray black and a more
yellow toned highlighter color all these
shadows in this palette are mapped with
the exception of blow which has a lovely
nice soft shimmer to it now basically
when I get new products and I really
want to put them to the test I do a cut
crease because with cut creases
lending is so precise and you can really
tell if a pallet is up to par if it
blends out a cut crease nicely so that
is exactly what I did today
off the bed I know that Urban Decay
matte shadows are super buttery
pigmented and intense and easy to work
with so I kind of felt like this palette
would be just that for example if we
look at the morphe 35o palette or
basically any other neutral palette out
there the matte shades are kind of more
on the dry side and more powdery with
this Urban Decay palette all the mats
are very buttery and almost had this
like cream texture it's not a cream
shadow whatsoever but it's so buttery
that it almost feels like a cream I
think the pigmentation on this palette
is OK there were some shades that
totally knocked me out of the park I was
like holy crap that is pigma right there
but there were also shades where I was
like oh I expected something darker and
more intense for example the top row of
this palette I expected all the colors
to be a little bit darker once I applied
them but they turned out to be lighter
so that kind of messed with my brain
especially instinct you will see it in
the demo later on but I applied that to
my lower lashline expecting such a like
umph lower lash eye color and it just
looked a little washed out I think the
color range of this palette is perfect
because you've got your warms neutrals
cool tones darks highlighters my only
little tiny niggy Negi downside to this
is that blow is such a beautiful color
but I am pale as paper and on me it's
like my skin tone with the shimmer so I
if I could wish for a lighter shade that
would pop unpeel Pacey's out there like
me I would not be mad at that I had
minimal to no fallout with the shadows
on my cheeks I find this palette to be
very beginners friendly because you have
all your neutral stones in there and
they're easy to blend out but I'm going
to be honest if you have like me 12
neutral palettes out there there is not
really a point in getting this unless
you're like a great urban decay fan and
you like supporting the brand another
thing that comes into play is that this
retails for $55 for $55 you get the
pallette the mirror 12 brand-new shades
and a little brush now this brush is
actually really nice the short side of
it is really great to really smudge
colors in there and the other side of
the brush I don't really like I really
don't like this side of the brush this
side however BOM so that altogether
retails for $55 and I have been informed
that this will launch September 18th
now with that any further ado I think
it's time to hop into the demo and see
how these shadows work on my skin how
they blend out how they apply what I
think of them just the entire Shaban so
if you would like to know how these work
on my eyes then keep watching all right
so the first thing I always do no matter
what I'm using over top is applying my
Mac soft ochre Paint Pot as a base
alright now I'm going to be dipping into
the color blue
to set my crease and brow bone area to
help blend the shadows later on okay
right off the bat I do notice a soft
Sheen it's a little darker than I would
like it but then again I'm pay less
paper so for me it isn't really going to
brighten my brow bone just gonna set
that base than how blending later on but
usually I like them a little bit lighter
to help brighten up my entire eye area
but this one is just a beautiful shimmer
as my transition shade today we're using
the colors nudie and commando and I'm
just going to brush that into my crease
for some definition and again as my
transition shade and when I picked up
the colors with my brush powder didn't
really blow up in the pan which I feel
like a lot of pilots nowadays do alright
once we have that transition right there
I'm gonna go in with extra bitter and
this is the shade I'm looking forward to
the most because it just speaks to me on
the spiritual level and this is going
right at the base of where we just
applied the transition colors yep that
is a beautiful color so I like to really
build up my crease so I take a little by
little a really build definition with so
far the pigmentation on X or bitter
fantastic so picking up a little bit
more and really starting to intensify
that deepening up the outer edge of that
crease even more now using a lethal so
far really enjoying working with these
shadows but especially this lethal color
can look a tiny bit streaky in places
but all you have to do is just blend
like a pro and you'll be good I'm going
to cut the lid using some Pro Longwear
concealer by Mac
and I'm going to set that entire Lydia's
in pregame and going over top using blow
with lethal I'm just going to define the
base of the cut crease a tad bit more
with instinct I'm not going to define
the lower lashline
okay this color is leaning a little too
powerless for me I expect it like a lot
more like darkness from it and it's like
this dusty brownish pinkish color I
don't love it isn't that the weirdest
when you expect a color to be so intense
and then it comes out kind of sheer and
less dark than you expected it to be and
you're like wow to add in that darkness
I'm going to add a little bit of lethal
and continuing defining that lower
lashline using faith to really grab the
look this needs some winged liner and
I'm going to use my latest obsession the
Tom Ford eye defining pin for Langer is
what dreams are made of
ephra lashes today I'll be using the an
etude assassine ashes alright so I know
this video is all about the pallid but I
always get so bummed out when I watch
one of these videos and they do eyes
only and I'm like what what did you use
for highlight what do you use on your
lips so I'm gonna show you highlighting
lips for my glow today I'll be going in
with the artist Couture diamond glow
powder in cocoa bling and I'm going to
pie it using a damp morphe Beauty sponge
oh my god
alright and then for lips are gonna be
using the Beauty bakery lip whip in
gingersnap and these are the most budge
proof liquid lipstick I've ever ever
tried in my life these will stay on
until you take them off and to lock this
look in place for the rest of the day I
think it's only fitting to use one of my
favorite Urban Decay's setting sprays
I'll be using chill and that is all I
have to say about this palette guys I
think it's a really great neutral
palette if you don't own too many
neutrals yet I think the consistency in
formula is very buttery and very easy to
work with but if you have a lot of
neutral colors I don't see the point of
getting this so if you don't have a lot
of neutrals I give this palette a full
yes if you have be 35 oh the kylie the
Shannon the mani I would say mess so
that's it guys I wouldn't think you guys
