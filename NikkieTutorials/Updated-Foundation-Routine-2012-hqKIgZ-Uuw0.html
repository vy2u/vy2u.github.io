highly highly dammit oh I always start
touching my hair and then I'm like I'm
looking in a few frame like it looks
good no so ruined so today I am going to
do a highly demanded updated foundation
routine I already had one like perfect
glowy finish tutorial it's right here um
I like that but I is way different
products now so yet if you want to know
how I do my skin lately like in the last
gazillion trillion billion videos um
then keep on watching this is me with
absolutely no makeup on just a
moisturizer and moisturizer actually is
step number one in any foundation
routine that I'm going to show you on my
channel moisturizer is probably the most
important thing that you can do to make
your skin look good moisturizer is a
must even though you feel like you don't
need it trust me on this one in 20 years
will be very very thankful I personally
have a really extreme combination skin
my t-zone is extremely oily like three
hours in I get oily as crap there right
here on my jawline and everything that's
basically not my t-zone and a little bit
right here I am as dry as sand and for
years I have been searching for the
perfect moisturizer I have been a fan of
Dermalogica but then my mother started
using Hana and how that is something new
for me
I am absolutely loving it at first I
didn't like it but that was because I
was using the wrong moisturizer
now the moisturizers that I love our
personal choice Juvenal cream by Holland
I love the packaging I love what it does
it's just it's really moisturizing plus
it's a little bit for wrinkles I am
eighteen years old I don't need anything
for wrinkles yet but better be early
than late this is sort of my step number
one moisturizer that I apply every
single day I use the touch of silk and
I've showed you this before in a
favorites video and I absolutely love
this stuff at night I
is more as a like really deep
moisturizing cream and for that I use do
remodeling cream by henna or ha-ah
it's way thicker than the touch of silk
but it's just so just when you put it on
you feel your skin like absorbing it and
just getting all of it out and just like
a lot of Shar I really did that so
before I started filming this video I
applied my personal choice by all that
and my remodeling cream because my skin
is a little bit dry at the moment so I
used that and also my mom will start
selling on that products in her webshop
starting July so will giving us updated
on that on Twitter or my facebook page
so my mom will start selling all of this
in July now depending on where you're
going to do throughout the day you can
decide to wear a primer or not because
my t-zone gets really really oily like
three hours in I always apply a primer
my favorite primer is the Make Up For
Ever HD primer professional you just
take one pump that's all you need and
then just put it on your t-zone and then
anything that's left on the rest of your
face just blend it in I always let that
sink in for a bit to really make it work
instead of just applying everything
right after excuses gorgeous hairdo I've
always been a huge humongous fan of the
Mac face and body I use this on photo
shoots all the times basically all I use
on my models I always use face and body
white because basically every foundation
that there is out there is too dark for
my skin tone in New York I discovered
Neutrogena Healthy Skin Foundation in
number ten classic ivory this is the
best foundation mixed with my face and
body it stays on your skin for hours
like in New York you do a lot of
blogging and it stayed perfectly on even
after IMATS as of lately I started using
this BB cream by Misha and this is
called the perfect cover BB cream in
number 21 I love
to mix my BB Creams into my foundation
mix to give it a little bit more of like
a treatment then I start mixing them all
together with my favorite foundation
brush which is the sadhana lays flat top
buffer brush I start buffing that into
my skin and I focus mainly on the parts
where I'm really really red don't forget
to blend down to your neck for my
concealer I use my Mac Pro Longwear
concealer and I got this because jump on
twice a day I just apply that right
under my eyes into these inner corners
because I tend to get dark there as well
and then anywhere where I have some
breakouts I apply it at home and to
blend it in I use my Beauty Blender and
this is dim so I wet it before and then
squeeze all the water out and when it's
damnit just smooth out that concealer
like a dream and with this I kind of
blend in my foundation a little bit more
as well because I find that with a damp
Beauty Blender it really goes like into
your skin it really blends it in and
makes it perfect
after concealer I always like to powder
and my favorite powder is by Kryolan and
this is their transparent powder first I
take my Inglot for SS brush take some of
the powder and first I set everything
under my eyes because that is where I
tend to crease first then I take my Real
Techniques blush brush and this is a
dream for face powder and I start
powdering my face always just a powder
brush in this motion especially if you
have really wet skin and you apply your
powder like wiping it with the brush all
you're basically doing is wiping that
foundation that you just bounce
perfectly in your just wiping it off
again which is going to show the redness
again after this I start doing my
contour my blush my high
for today I'm just using my NYX blush in
taupe for a contour blush I'm going to
use my Mac launch away blush from the
hey sailor collection and as a highlight
my favorite whisper of guilt extra
dimension skin finish by America's well
so I'm just going to do some quick blush
and contouring and then I will be back
that is the last step I love to use a
finishing spray just to keep it all on a
little bit longer what I love is the
skin the navy a finishing spray this is
absolutely amazing
at first I didn't think it worked little
disclaimer you have to shake it I
haven't shaked it for one bit when I
started using and I was like oh my god
you suck and then what I like to do is
just do like a couple of sprays and that
will also get rid of the really powdery
finish of your like powder that you
apply so right now
you have like really beautiful perfect
skin so yeah guys that completes my
updated foundation routine as of lately
