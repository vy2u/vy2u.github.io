today I am doing a Halloween my first
Halloween tutorial of the year on this
vampire princess or a queen look I got
blood shattered smoky eyes got a a
droplet of blood on the corner of my
mouth and it got this bloody choker
necklace situation going on I feel very
vampy so today is the start of Holi week
and in Holi week we have a bunch like so
many Halloween tutorials coming up and
if I'm in the mood and if I can make the
time I might even go a little bit
further than a week so who knows so
today is day number one and today I was
inspired by Juliana on Instagram and I
had the honor the pleasure of filming
with Juliana for my makeup like this
series with Maybelline back in New York
and that video actually went to be
yesterday so if you want to see that
click somewhere in the screen and I saw
her do a blood shattered eye and it
really inspired me to take inspiration
from that and create a smoky look on it
plus I was inspired by a couple more
friends of mine who I'll talk about in
the video later on but I am so excited
that we are here today we're gonna have
so much fun this week
this look is definitely more on the glam
/ sexy side I definitely want to show
you a wide variety of looks this week so
um yeah if you are in the mood to be
sexy and glam for Halloween but yeah but
still a little bit freaky then keep on
watching alright so the first thing I'm
going to do for this look that I do not
know the name of hit is go in with a
primer this is my jae-won jelly pack and
ever since I bought this it's been a
favorite and I can't put it down this
will make my makeup last all day so
especially during Halloween you want to
be scary all night lay all night for
foundation today I'm going to be mixing
as always I'm going to be going in with
my all-time favorite Lancome patty doll
ultra wear and a new launch right here
this is by G way this is called the
essential high coverage cream foundation
now this
a punch this has so much coverage and
you only need the tiniest bit and I
really like mixing it in with other
foundations to really get it there and
to give it that longevity this one lasts
forever and it launched today it is
available right now so they come with a
bunch of shades I know they're coming
out with 10 more shades really really
soon but um
this combo is gonna be it today and
we're covered now this overall is pretty
intense of glam wise it's not as scary
as some might wanted to but I definitely
wanted to make a good mix of wearable
glam scary frightening I wanted to mix
it all this Halloween so we're starting
off with something a little bit more
glam of course inspired by Julianna and
that's why for this look I am following
my natural skin tone can you go lighter
absolutely but I'm not going to today
because I want to keep the overall look
a little bit more wearable and glam as
far as those words apply to my channel
it's just not very seriously how full
coverage is this mixture right here and
because the G way foundation is a little
bit more matte and satiny it lasts so
much longer glam so much concealer I'm
just gonna start buffing in a bunch of
random randomness because I've stepped
away from the tart shape tape because I
found it to be too dry for my skin's my
under eyes looked cracky and just to not
not in a good way so it was time for me
to say goodbye and move on with my life
and so I am trying out a bunch of stuff
to see if anything will give me the
pleasure of shape tape and yes I'm
talking about shape days hmm this could
be a Halloween looking on of itself
setting my under eyes using the
Maybelline fit me loose powder in number
thighs
now like I said this is full coverage
Halloween scary glam so I'm now going to
set my face using some Cody airspun and
my damp sponge I really press it in
there and if you're looking for a trick
to make your base last all day long go
have a damp sponge like this one and
apply your face powder with it like that
this will bake your face in such a
flawless way it gets rid of the plans of
pores it's just it's everything you want
on the lift first I'm going in with this
NYX lid lingerie matte in the color
white it doesn't have a color does it
have a color that to the bone and I'm
applying this to get some whiteness
going to make all the blood pop so apply
it straight to the lid and then go in
with a brush and blend out
now going into taco eyeshadow by
sugarpill to set the lid with a whole
lot of white going into this mehron
paradise palette and taking this a red
color right here called red picking that
up on a little texture sponge like this
now if you're like what what is that I
think we've all seen these very
texturized sponges for Halloween and
I've just cut a little corner out of it
to match my eye but this is basically
what we'll be using for the
blood-spatter with a tiny bit of the
face paint on that sponge I'm gonna
stipple the blood onto my lid and kind
of work it out gradually like a smoky
eye
see how it almost has the shape and
intensity of a smoky eye where it's more
intense here and then it kind of
splatters out
that's why Twombly now with this Makeup
Forever aqua liner in the color 10 I am
going to create a wing after applying
that wing you want to set it and make it
a little bit darker using this oxblood
red color from the Jovians place the
horan to palette now you can totally
leave it as is but I want it to be a
smoky blood-spattered eye so I really
want the blood to be part of the smoky
eye so I'm going in with black shadow
and really diffusing the outer corners
and diffusing it even more using their
red color from the Sahara to palette and
now we're gonna focus on the lower lash
I know basically I'm gonna take this
color right here so it's a mixture of
that red color and the black and put it
on the outer corners of my lower lash
line with this Marc Jacobs pencil in
fine wine I'm going to extend my inner
corner and a little bit of pink of me on
the waterline to finish all you'll need
is some lashes and these are the flutter
lashes in intoxicating
all right eyes are done and I must say I
am living it is a classic blown out cat
smokey eye but with blood it's
inevitable on use it I'm not even gonna
talk about that adding some bronze
because we're not a ghost mm-hmm
I look like a ghost or town but we're
not a ghost we're going for glam some
additional contouring for blush I'm
gonna go for something nice and pink
this is the Sigma lady slipper or a
powder you know what let's carve out
that cheek a little bit while we're at
it and for highlighter I also want to go
a little bit more on the pinky side so I
have this BH black light highlight sixth
color palette and I'm gonna be
highlighting with the pink right here
called OnPoint and highlighting the
highest point using strobe the white
therefore lips I'm gonna go in with this
color drained liquid lipstick in the
colour swerve
and then to tie the entire look together
I saw my good friend Luna dude this for
Halloween do you see so I definitely
want to add this to the look to tighten
with the blood on my eyes a little
triplet a little droplet of blood on the
lips all right now to finish off this
look I have this right here this is my
go get glitter and this is a diamond
bloody choker and I thought this would
be the perfect finishing touch to this
very bloody look so this is a carefully
peel the clear sticker it's a sticker
from the plastic sheet and then do your
thing so here we have it so if you just
like you get what I want to go with this
