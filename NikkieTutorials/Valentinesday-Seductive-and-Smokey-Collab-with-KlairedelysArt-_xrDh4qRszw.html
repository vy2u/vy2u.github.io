Valentine's look and this is sort of the
more seductive vampy look for when
you're going clubbing on Valentine's
there or something I don't know I just
really like the colors red and black
together today I'm doing another collab
with Claire girlies aren't here on
YouTube we did one with Halloween and I
love doing it with her that Sun is so so
so wrong like in so many ways this is
Claire's look I absolutely love it with
our beautiful little smiles and our
beautiful eyes and a beautiful face and
Claire's just so pretty I love art so
definitely go check out her video the
link is in the bottom bar and also when
you click on the photos that just were
there then you're going to her video
yeah if you want to know I did this then
please keep on watching okay so the
first thing you're going to do is apply
a base to your eyelids to prevent this
eyeshadow from creasing I'm gonna use
soft ochre Paint Pot from egg okay now
I'm going to take my AK jumbo pencil in
milk and I'm just applying that softly
over my lid to really make the colors
that go on top stick to it and pop now
I'm going to take this BH Cosmetics 26
colors neutral palette and I'm going to
use this color right here and make it a
little bit darker with that color right
there and I'm just gonna pop that on to
my lids and I'm going to apply
Illamasqua is wolf into my crease with
this Sigma brush and I really want to
make the shape round so I'm not really
gonna make a wing at the outer fee so
I'm just gonna make it around so just
maybe see it as a see I'm making an
outer C then blend some of the eyeshadow
onto the lid and just put it in the
crease now I'm gonna take this makeup
studio 18 eyeshadow colors palette and
I'm going to
that Brown right there and I'm going to
smoke out the crease with that a little
bit just smoke it up a bit and just make
it a little bit more blending it out
then we're going to take my favorite
blending brush by Mac which is the 224
and Max cork and blend that out and make
sure that when you're blending it out
you don't make it pointy then you really
want to keep the eye shape round and
then we're gonna go back into woven just
darken everything up a bit again okay
now for this awesome red wine ish color
underneath I'm gonna go back to the bhp
lit and I'm going to take this color
right here where's my finger ah there's
that color right there they're deep wine
color and I'm just basically gonna make
a line underneath my eyes and then smoke
it out I'm also gonna go down quite a
bit because I really want to make it
this like gothy seductive look so first
off just place a Chado and then blend it
down okay I'm gonna make that a little
bit more red with my makeup City up
olive again and the color I'm using is
that one right there this will make it a
little bit more reddish and vibrant so
go ahead and blend that underneath to
really make it Fred okay now I'm gonna
take the black out of the makeup city of
pallet and just smoke it down the lashes
to make it a little bit more vampy and
again seductive this also will make the
rent so much more wearable okay then I
want to smoke the upper lashes a bit
more so I'm gonna take the black again
and just do this thing that I did on the
bottom but then just do it on the top
just on black to eventually hide the
false lashes as well
now I'm gonna take some birch while
healthy mix concealer and clean up under
my eyes and then I'm gonna set it with
the powder as well okay now I'm gonna
spice it up with some copper Beijing
later
this is OCC's basic litter this is one
of the most amazing glitters I've ever
seen in my entire life it's so pretty
and to make that stick I'm gonna use la
splash eyeliner base base but that's it
it says base honey booboo child
okay all I'm gonna do now is put some
black eyeliner up in my waterline that
will really make it seductive and
wearable because black and red is really
pretty together friends I'm going to use
the Urban Decay 24/7 glide-on eye pencil
in zero then I'm going to use some
mascara and apply false lashes and a
mascara I'm using is by bourgeois and
this is the volume fast and perfect
mascara and look this is so pretty
you're gonna love it it rotates it goes
other way too and I must say it's an
awesome mascara not just because it
rotates but the formula of it is really
good as well and it really holds curls
and then I'm gonna put some false lashes
on and these are the red cherry number
76
I'm going to use Mac's flash pop
lipstick and this is a really nice mint
new color for lighter girls like me and
then you can make it a little bit more
pinky with Maxine Jermaine I am not sure
if I'm going to do that yet maybe my
Kuzak
and just because I really want to turn
this into a really glamorous look I'm
gonna apply some lip gloss and I know
you guys I never run across are you're
like what and those boss I'm using is my
Mac also and this is called underage so
