makeup tutorial in my previous fall
makeup tutorial I mentioned homegirl
lipstick by Kat Von D and how I really
wanted to do a tutorial using that soon
well soon came quicker than we all
thought because it's here already see
this is what I came up with for today's
fall makeup tutorial so if you like what
you see and you want to know how I got
it then please stay tuned so first thing
I'm going to be doing is applying a base
to my eyelids and this is going to help
prevent the eyeshadows from creasing
plus it's just going to make everything
look a lot more vivid and intense and
just overall better really and for this
I'm using my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot
then I'm going in the UH Nastasia
Beverly Hills Miami appellate and I'm
taking the color warm taupe and with a
zoeva 228 crease brush I'm just focusing
this in my crease going from inner to
outer corner and this is going to be our
crease definition color and I absolutely
love warm taupe from the Miami appellate
because it gives definition but it's not
too warm
nor is it too cool toned it's just the
perfect Brown really then with days away
VAT 234 Lux a smoky shader I'm picking
some of warm taupe up again and I'm
focusing this on the inner part of my
lid sort of the inner third and blending
up to the crease so that they meet and
then I'm also focusing it on the outer
third so you leave a nice clean gap in
the middle you can even focus it in the
crease a little bit more to give it some
definition but you just want to keep
that middle part bare and with a fluffy
brush go ahead and blend that out and
soften the edges really importante so
for the middle part I'm taking the UH
Nastasia metallic luster liner and this
is liquid gold this is one of
my favorite products at the moment so
you want to look down and paint this at
the middle of your lid I kind of went
off center damn with the brown we're
just going to ignore that so once you've
got that in the middle you want to take
a pencil brush this is by Sigma and you
want to diffuse the edges with the brown
actually I'm going to add a little bit
more Brown here because off-center then
I'm going into my uh Nastasia Beverly
Hills Taman address your face palette
and it has a color called the blush
which is the perfect color to highlight
that liquid gold pencil even more so
with the same brush I'm taking blush and
going over top slightly so we can blend
the edges a little bit better with the
brown now for the lower lash line I'm
again picking up a warm taupe and we're
mimicking the top on the bottom so warm
taupe is going on that outer part of my
lower lash line meeting up with the
Brown here that outer corner and then
I'm also applying it to the very inner
part of my lower lash line and again
leaving that middle part bare and you
guessed it going back with that liquid
gold pencil applying it right to the
middle and applying blush from the
tamanna' dress your face palette over
top so we've just repeated what we have
on top to the bottom then I was taking
one of my favorite sparkles this is
makeup studio dual effects in shine and
I'm going to add this to the places
where I applied the liner to give it
some more sparkle and pizzazz and then
I'm also going to punch some on the
inner part of my eyes to Sparkle it up
and open it up and make it more more
now I'm picking up a little bit of uh
Nastasia Beverly Hills waterproof cream
color in jets and basically what I'm
doing with it is drawing a really small
and precise line covering the roots of
my lashes to give the look a little bit
more depth and to make the false lashes
that I put on top blend in nicer so it's
just do camouflage the lashes and the
brush I'm using for this actually came
with that Maybelline liquid note gel
eyeliner set it's actually great for you
know doing all types of eyeliner work
okay now what I'm going to do is finish
off with mascara and false lashes so I'm
going to take the makeup studio
waterproof 3d in extra black as always
and for falsies today I'm using the XO
Beauty is a fangirl lashes so for the
cheeks I really want to go sculpted with
a little bit of a flush surrounding the
cheek and lots and lots of glow because
I love glowy skin really dark lips and
these sort of you know alright so as
always I'm taking my Illamasqua
eyeshadow in heroine to contour for
blush I'm using one of my old favorites
this is an arse a sex appeal blush I
love this one it's so understated and
natural-looking yet it still gives the
face color and it's still you know peps
up the skin it makes it look really nice
and natural and pretty and this one from
a highlighter slash glow today I'm going
in with my favorite pigment by Mac
called
vanilla and I'm applying this right
underneath the side of my eyes and then
blending on to the highest points of my
cheeks then I'm also focusing this on
the bridge of my nose and in this little
dent right here and then on the highest
tip of my nose I'm drawing a little dot
with the highlighter okay that's a
little intense
let's not forget Cupid's bow and those
little things that go up and just the
tiniest bit on the chin then now it's
finally time for the showstopper of the
look which aren't the lips let's go the
lipstick I'm using today is of course
homegirl by Kat Von D I promise I will
use it soon soon came quicker than we
expected it to be soon see I'm going to
apply homegirl straight to the lips if

to apply lipstick like a pro I will put

ah applying dark lipstick is so
nerve-racking it's ah okay focus you can
do this then because I want to go for
that high glamour touch I'm going to
apply a gloss over top of this I'm
