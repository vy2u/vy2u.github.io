tutorial on this I call it the vampy
vixen it includes a lot of reds and
pinks and purples and it's just a super
seductive fall look and I just I was
really in the mood for glitter so I
popped it on the inner corners see yeah
without any further ado if you want to
know how to get this fall then P vixen
makeup look then please stay tuned so as
always the first thing I'm starting off
with is applying a base to my eyelids to
prevent everything from creasing and I'm
using my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot for
this now I'm taking makeup geeks
unexpected and cupcake eyeshadows and
this is going straight into my crease
and I'm going for a rounded shape today
so once you reach that outer corner here
you just want to round it out then I'm
gonna blend that out using on estancia
Beverly Hills blushing eyes shadow and
I'm just using a big fluffy blending
brush for this this is the one by zueva
then to deepen that crease I'm taking
sugar pills poison plum and a little bit
of Anastasia Beverly Hills a beauty mark
and this combo is going super finely is
that a term I'm making it one sketch
that into the crease so it gets more
definition and it gets a hint of purple
and then I'm taking makeup geeks
wisteria with a blending brush and I'm
just gonna feather this up and out so it
gets a little bit more of a lie lucky
touch fix it a little tad bit softer and
we're girly for the bottom lash line I'm
taking beauty mark again and we're going
to create this new inner corner and this
is something I love to do but especially
when applying glitter to the new inner
corner area because it completely
changes up the eyes the first in place
in beauty mark to the roots of my lower
lashes
now once I'm like halfway there it
switch over to a really slanted precise
angled brush and I create a new in a
corner now mixing sugar pills poison
plum with makeup geeks wisteria I'm
blending this in on the outer part of my
lower lash line and this to get more
purple in the look and if you're in the
mood for it it goes super low with this
I'm gonna because I really like that
smoke dab bottom-heavy
feel and then while you're at it
connects it to the top portion of the
eye and then now I'm going in a Sigma
blush this is the modesty powder blush
and really softly I'm gonna blend this
in at the highest points of my blending
so sort of where my blending ended I'm
applying it right there to add some pink
and then also here on that bottom
portion alright for the lid I'm mixing
two colors by Anasazi Beverly Hills
these are frosted lilac and touch of
lilac you just want to apply this to the
lid all the way up to that purple that's
course and then here at the sides just
kind of blend it in and then I like to
go in with a little bit of the purple
and blend the two seamlessly for the
glitter I'll be using OCC's glitter in
pink and my mixing medium today is gonna
be the clearly liquid glitter base by
lit and with this you want to fill up
that new inner corner and then your
grace with this fabulous new inner
corner I love this trick so much alright
and now all is left to do is the
eyeliner and for this I'm using my
favorite Kat Von D tattoo liner in
trooper
because I have hooded eyes I'm gonna go
about half way in so when I look up you
can still see some of the lit space okay
to finish off the eyes it's time for
mascara and falsies and for mascara be
using the waterproof 3d extra black by
makeup studio and for falsies I'm using
the Mac 36 false lashes okay so for the
cheeks I'm gonna go sculpted and really
rosy and kind of warm actually and of
course lots of lots of flow so the first
product I'll be using is Illamasqua
eyeshadow in heroine this to carve out
my cheeks and everything then for blush
I'm first going in with a little bit of
Illamasqua kiss and this is super dark
from my fair skin tone but exactly what
I want I'm just taking the tiniest bit
and I'm blending it in with my contour
so right here a little bit above it I'm
gonna start blending it into the sides
of my face more so that gives our cheeks
are really nice warmth now so give it a
little bit more of a blush II feeling
I'm again taking that same stick my
blush that we used before this is
modesty and this is going more so on the
apples of the cheeks and for my glow
today at musing my Ben Nye iced Lumiere
looks powder boo by oh okay and the free
lifts were gonna go super super dark and
matte so frizz I'm just gonna line and
fill in my lips using night moss a
little bit pencil by Mac
and then with lingering kiss lipstick by
Mac I'm going over top
