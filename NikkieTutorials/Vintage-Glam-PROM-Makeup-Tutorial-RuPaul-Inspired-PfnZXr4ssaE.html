inspired makeup tutorial this is
inspired by season 7 episode number 5
this is my next installment for my
RuPaul's Drag Race
series and for this week Rou came down
the runway and I fell in love everything
was pure perfection RuPaul was the true
winner of this episode so I try to tone
down the look a little bit so it's more
appropriate for let's say prom or even
like Christmas we're in April now but
we're already talking about Christmas
this is just a very fun glamorous old
Hollywood glam look and I absolutely
love it
rue stole me this episode and I didn't
have bunny ears so I made this so yeah
if you want to know how to get this
RuPaul inspired makeup look perfect for
like prom or whatever kind of event you
have to go to then please keep on
watching all right so the first thing
I'll be going in with today is a new
product for me so this is my first time
trying it out this is the Smashbox
primer water I've heard so many great
things about this so I'm going to try it
out today oh my god that smells amazing
it's not wet but it's actually tacky so
I think this is great for foundation to
really lock in and grab itself onto the
skin hmm I like okay now time for some
glow using my Dior glow Maximizer and
for foundation today I'm going to go
into my Kryolan tv paint stick in g19
one I'm blending this in with a brush
to contour musing be Kyle on TV paint
stick in FS 31
and to highlight another kryolan tiffy
pain sick this is 406 and again blending
this in with a brush alright and now
quickly setting that with powder to
prevent it from creasing alright I'm
quickly going to do a soft nose contour
and brows and one eye off-camera and
then it will be back so let's get
started on the eyes the first thing I'll
be doing is sketching out where I want
my winged liner to go to and I'm doing
this with a matte dark brown eye shadow
now I'm taking on Asus a Beverly Hills
eye shadow in fun and with this I'm
going to start defining my crease
carving out the crease so I'm just
taking this what is this the Sigma small
tapered blending brush and I'm just
defining my crease then I'm going to be
bringing it all the way in to the inside
portion of my eyes and with a fluffy
blending brush I'm softly going to blend
that out
then I'm going to deepen the outer
portion of my crease using another
Anastasia Beverly Hills eyes shadow this
is a smoke
so with this I'm just darkening the
outer portion of the crease and lid just
the outer portion and then the inner
part of the crease needs a little bit
more warmth and for this I'm taking the
Anasazi Beverly Hills eyeshadow in
caramel for the lid I'll be using honest
as de Rivoli Hills eye shadow in gold
rush and this will mainly be going on to
the middle portion of the lid meeting up
to that crease so you want to leave this
space open right here now for that inner
third I'm using this makeup studio
SHINee effects pigment in golden light
and this is going right here also going
up to that crease and with this you can
actually cut that crease a little bit
and then for the inner corners I'm
taking this Jesse's girl I dust and I
don't know the name so I'm going to have
to do a little bit of research right on
that inner corner boom and then also
connecting this to those lid colors now
it's time to complete the eyeliner
to define the lower lashes just a tad
bit I'm taking smoke by anastasia
beverly hills again and this is going
right here on that outer corner really
close to the roots of my lower lashes
and connecting it with the eyeliner to
sparkle up my inner corners and first
taking my makeup studio jewel effects
and shine and then for a little bit of
actual silver glitter i'm taking max
glitter in silver to open up the eyes
even more i'm taking a white eye pencil
and out to finish off these eyes all you
want to do is apply lashes to your top
lashes only and today i'm using the
house of lashes iconic lashes for cheeks
of course we did all our contouring
already so i'm just going to bronze up
my face a little bit more using the give
me sun bronzing powder by mac yes for
blush you're going to mix two the first
one is by the balm this is down boy
blush and of course Milani Luminoso
for highlighter today I'm of course is
in my Becca shimmering skin perfecter
pressed in moonstone
yes mama ephra lips of course you want
to go for that classic red so today I'll
be using vanity rain by colored rain
I've been loving the color drain liquid
lipsticks so today I'll be using the red
and that concludes the makeup so I'm not
gonna do my hair real quick and then it
will be back and that guys concludes
