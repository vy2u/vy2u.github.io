installment of my RuPaul's Drag Race
Season seven series today is episode
number two and my favorite this week was
violet chachki I was inspired by her
runway look because she had this
gorgeous jumpsuit on tailored to
perfection with her tiny little waist
I loved it she were these super nice
smoky almost pinup eyes and then these
red and pink ombre lips which totally
stole me and I love this look so yeah
that's it if you want to know how to get
this violet chachki from episode number
two from RuPaul's Drag Race Season seven
makeup little eye where was i if you
want to know how to get this look right
here then please stay tuned for
foundation today I'm going to use the
Mac Studio Fix fluid in NC 15 and I'm
buffing this in using my Sigma s 88
then for now I'm going to leave this as
is and I'm going to skip over to browse
and one eye and then it will be back to
show you the other eye okay it's always
for the eyes I'm going to start off by
priming them I'm using my Mac soft ochre
Paint Pot this is all you need for
private in your life you're born naked
the rest of soft ochre Paint Pot so just
like our Perl tutorial I'm not going to
take max a sketch I shadow and I'm going
to use this to map out where I want my
new eye to go to so starting off with
this huge winged eyeliner line from
there we're good on to the lid I make it
really thick okay so once you got that
you also want to map out where you want
your new crease to go to okay so once we
got that sketched out I'm going to go
into makeup geek scoop all over my boobs
I'm going to go into makeup geeks
corrupt which is my favorite matte black
eyeshadow and I'm going to fill in that
new eyeliner shape and we're going to
build that in that's all
that was a pencil-shaped of blending
brush I'm going to blend out sketch in
my new crease with sketch so I'm just
going to start diffusing and blending
out that line just as if we were
blending out our regular crease we're
just doing the same with our new crease
now I'm now taking melde's blur
eyeshadow and this to blend everything
out
now mixing sketch by Mac with enigma buy
melts I'm going to add this to blend
sketch out even more and also give it a
little bit more warmth for the little be
using Mac's feather pink and this is
going on the parts of the eye that
doesn't have anything on it yet so right
in-between the new crease and the black
liner
and then using Anasazi Beverly Hills
bone I'm going to highlight the inner
corners okay I'm now going to conceal my
under eye area just to clean everything
up and of course to conceal and
highlight and form a concealer today
I'll be using my pro longwear concealer
by Mac and highlight it and make it even
lighter I'm going to take my creole on
tv' pin stick in white a quick place
setting that with powder alright now for
the lower lash line the first thing I
want to do is extend your inner corners
to optically make your eyes appear
larger what what are you doing so for
this I'm using my Kat Von D tattoo liner
in trooper just to extend that inner
corner now for the lower lash line I'm
again taking sketch and I'm placing this
on the outer corner of my lower lash
line and for now you want to stay close
to the roots of your lashes and blend
down but then with a pencil brush you
want to drag it underneath the black
line and sort of leave a little space
open for glitter
now I'm taking my makeup studio jewel
fix in shine and that is going right in
between and once you've got the glitter
on your eyeshadow and all that is
completed so now I'm quickly going to
apply some lashes and then it will be
back I'm going to contour today using my
Kryolan derma color palette and it has
all these really high coverage
concealers in it and I'm going to
contour using this color right here and
this color right here forehead and I'm
going to buff this all in using the Real
Techniques expert face brush let's
create a beige rainbow here and of
course I'll be deepening this with a
contour powder later on and I'm going to
highlight my nose and contour my nose
and highlight the other parts I'm going
to highlight using my Kyle and T V paint
stick and whites let's just just you see
what I'm doing just just watch
okay let's highlight
you
alright let's blend this in
therefore blush anthony's bobbi brown
pink coral and for my highlight i'm of
course using my Becca shimmering skin
Perfector in moonstone violet were
completely matte lips so the only
products I'll be using today are lip
pencils so first off I'm going to line
my lips using Mac's red lip pencil
because her outline was red and then it
gradually went into a hot - neon pink so
we're going from red to neon pink the
next pencil I'll be using is by also by
Mac this is candy yum-yum lip pencil now
all you want to do is slap a wig on and
change your outfit and you're done and
