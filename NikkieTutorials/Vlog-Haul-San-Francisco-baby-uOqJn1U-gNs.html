long time ago so you might have been
missing two videos of my last week
because I didn't upload two I was in San
Francisco since a nan thought it would
be fun to share with you what happened
in San Francisco and what I bought of
course because as soon as I posted a
picture on Instagram if it was like do a
haul I will so this video is just gonna
be a sort of like a vlog slash haul San
Francisco video so a couple of weeks ago
I got an email from benefit Holland to
be one of the few to go to San Francisco
for the major launch of a new product
that benefit is launching in May and the
PR girl from benefit Holland told me
that she could only choose two people to
go to San Francisco and she chose me so
I was one of the two of Holland to go
and that would like I cried balls like
oh my god
so my stuff on Sunday and Monday as
today that I leave the flight was an 11
hour flight so then I arrived at San
Francisco Airport and I get this driver
who has this like card in his hand that
says hello gorgeous
and I totally walked past him because I
did not feel gorgeous or whatsoever so
then I saw buddhahood a beauty from
Instagram walked to that sir with the
car the driver that said hello gorgeous
and I could hear her say oh are you the
driver for the benefit event and I was
like oh that's me too so then we
walked to the car and then the driver
tells us all about San Francisco me and
Hooda and um he drops us off at the
hotel the hotel I was staying in was the
ritz-carlton holy it didn't even
look like a hotel it looks like like a
monument it was not like from the
outside no way that it was a hotel so I
am in my hotel room and I just kind of
take in what is really happening around
me and I start crying because this is
the first time that I get flown over to
like San Francisco America and for like
such a big event I just start bawling
like like waterfalls
out and I'm just so thankful and happy
that I'm there so after the balling I
take a shower I do my makeup I do my
hair and then I text my good friend Elba
Mayo and we spent my first night
shopping and eating and doing what girls
love to do Elba is an amazing sweet
gorgeous girl I love her and Elba thank
you so much for like guiding me through
San Francisco and for the good food and
someone's ringing the bell then the next
day in the morning we had a Venn affair
and it was so nice because we actually
went to benefit headquarters and there
were like little there was a fortune
teller there was a picture booth so in
the morning we have two benneferre with
all those nice little things right there
and there also was food so that was a
little bit of brunch slash lunch as well
yes and so then after that we have free
time and I decided to go around San
Francisco with hooda with a beauty from
Instagram and we got American cupcake
and we got uh Sephora
I will talk about that later we just
drove around San Francisco with our
driver and we just ate in and out which
was my first internet experience ever
and then I meant vintage or tacky I met
Cora which was like what I didn't even
expect to meet her on this trip so that
was absolutely amazing
I met her husband and her best friend as
well those who were so much fun and we
had so much fun like walking around San
Francisco we got lost because we were
looking for a place to eat food and then
we actually ended up eating subway after
that I had to hurry back to the hotel to
change my outfit because in the nights
with benefit they rented the entire
Alcatraz Island and I'm not just talking
like the prison or like the tour know
like benefit rented the rock and what
they did was they put pink lights
everywhere and then we would get a tour
through the island and then at the end
we would get the audio tour that
everyone can get there and then in the
top of Alcatraz in the hospital where
actually the prison is like in the
hospital in the top of the prison
and there were pink lights everywhere
and there was a party we partied in the
hospital of Alcatraz I was really
intrigued I was really like interested
in what Alcatraz is all about of what
happened there so I could kind of feel
that most of the girls who were there
kind of were like okay we're on this
island it's a little bit scary just walk
and get it over with but I was like
almost the only one there who actually
wanted to know you know what happened
there before it would like what was
going on there so when we did the tour I
I was like the only one asking questions
I was the only one showing interest to
the ranger who was doing Meritor and
it's so funny because every time I asked
a question I could hear people think
shut up already I was the last one to go
into the audio tour because I was
chit-chatting with the Ranger said that
the tours and actually the Rangers told
their ranger group that I was a girl who
wanted to know everything so now I
officially have a name with them as well
so I went into the audio tour and I was
at the part where they just escaped
Alcatraz and then they had to stop
because because I was stopping everyone
from the party because they had to wait
till everyone was upstairs in the
hospital and I was keeping everyone up
so i had to stop with the audio tour in
Alcatraz after the part that they got
out and then once I got up in the
hospital if they could start the party
and again I could feel people thinking
like oh there she is
the following day was the launch of the
new product and we met Lisa Eldridge
there and a lot of great great makeup
artists as well but I met Lisa Eldridge
first thing Lisa told me was well what a
great skin you have I was like great
never ever complaining about my skin
again so yeah we had the launch in the
morning and then after the release and
the launch of the new product which we
can't talk about until May 1st we had
free time again and then the next
morning I had
with Jessie and Lisa Lisa Eldridge and
her assistant and we just did some chit
chatting and then it was time for me to
go back home so that is the vlog part of
San Francisco I love Tim Francisco the
people are really nice I loved the sort
of the defy and the laid-back feeling I
should just stop talking about because
you wanna know what I bought so the
first thing I want to talk about it's
the tard all met pellet and I am loving
this I'm wearing it on my eyes today in
my crease and this palette just has the
most amazing nude colors with a little
bit of purple here and then it has a
blush color and it really really
pigmented black and you're really
pigmented dark brown and I must say I am
loving this so much so in here is the
product from benefit that they're
launching in May which we can't talk
about until May first
so can show you next I want to talk
about the hourglass ambient lighting
powder powder powders when I first
walked into Sephora I saw that they had
our left so I was like the powders so I
first got ethereal light which is this
color right here it's just a really nice
light color with a really pretty glow to
it
and they use this to stuff my entire
foundation and then I also got the fused
light which is a little bit more yellow
and a little bit more golden toned and I
got this because Cora from vintage or
tacky told me to get this she was like
girl you got a theory Oh light why
didn't you get diffuse flight it was
like because the Thira light matte just
me more and then she was like what yeah
the feels light has yellow so that
fights retinas and I was like oh Kim get
it I got the Urban Decay all nighter
makeup setting spray because of Alba she
told me this is awesome I did spritz
this all over my face right before I
went to the Alcatraz party carolita
worked I got the Becca shimmering skin
perfecter in Pearl and this is going
into my kit for photoshoots because this
has the most amazing sort of Dewey shine
and I really want to apply this to like
a wet face and on a powdered face and
that is what I do go on to it I lost
highlighting on shoots I love giving my
models like like the perfect glowy like
Dewey's
and I think this is gonna be awesome for
that from Tarte
I got the Amazonian clay 12 hour blush
in a doll face I love the Tarte blushes
they are so pigmented they stay on like
a dream they blend like a dream I have
overexposed but now I have doll face as
well and let's just say that I'm really
loving this blush I really love it oh
yeah I got the anastasia beverly hills
dipbrow pomade in blonde because
everyone and their mother on youtube has
been using this and i think i'm gonna be
the first one who says that i don't like
it i doesn't work for me like the color
it's way too warm and like it just
doesn't apply evenly and and and this
will probably end up being a no god no
from Stila I got these stay all day what
a prove liquid eyeliner in amber and
this is a really nice sort of brick-red
orange liquid liner and it's so sick
because you just apply wait I'm barely
gonna touch my skin BAM this liner is
super super pigmented it stays on so
well I wore it as an eyeliner to the
Elco chest party and I got lots and lots
of compliments on it and I love the
color because it's great for blue eyes
and I love it from Sephora I got a
colorful eyeliner in waterproof and this
is the blue one and this is called pool
party and I got this because elba told
me to get this she has this color as
well and basically the color you see
here is the color of the liner it's
super intense bright royal blue and it's
amazing I have a lot of fun issues that
you can't get in Holland starting with
the Revlon Colorstay combination oily
skin in 110 ivory I've been using this a
lot in the past but um it got old and
had to get new ones but it didn't go to
America so it didn't have them so I got
that I got a backup of the Neutrogena
Healthy Skin and what's the color ten
classic ivory I've been using that for a
long time as well had to get rid of it
because it was getting old and that also
got the L'Oreal True Match
in neutral soft ivory and one and I used
this just when I started using makeup
like I used the true match foundation
just when I started using makeup and
then I just you know try different stuff
and never really looked at it again
until I was at Walgreens in San
Francisco and I saw this and I'm wearing
it today so if you're wondering what my
foundation is today is right this right
this right here I also got the Mac
marelize moisture foundation in nc15
I've been obsessing over this foundation
because it's so glowy and healthy
looking and it's you only need two tiny
as a bit of product and it just covers
up beautifully
so another foundation so yeah this is
all I got the last thing I want to show
you is at the benefit so the the
headquarters event from benefit there
was a really cool dude who did
caricature drawings I was thinking that
right caricature and right before I sat
down in front of him I told him make me
look nice and curvy and pretty and he
did I want you to meet my alter-ego
Mickey the drawing I mean come on love
them kids so that's it that's it for my
