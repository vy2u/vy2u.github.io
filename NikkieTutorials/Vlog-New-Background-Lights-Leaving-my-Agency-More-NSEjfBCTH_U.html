fun to do another vlog I did one a
couple of months ago and it was about
tailbone terrors and lip injections and
all that kind of a jig and a lot of you
seem to kind of like those videos so um
you asked for more vlogs and sort of
more chitchat II sort of talking flock
so here I am standing on my chair in
front of all my lights and uh talking to
you so how are you all doing I hope
you're doing well I hope your day is
being fantastic so I should get probably
tell I got new background lights I got
two umbrella lights and I actually left
the umbrella off so I don't really know
why I got the Arella lights so I have
one right there and I have one right
there and I'm from eBay a couple of days
before New Year's Eve I discovered
Shannon from New Zealand Shan ik so here
on YouTube and I was just so upset you
guys know her she has over 600,000
subscribers and she has a really sort of
like cute and perfect setup and is
really clean and light and white and she
has the ring light by the way everyone
has ring lights nowadays I wish I could
fit it in my sort of I have a wall
behind the camera so I can't really fit
anything like a lot of stuff there so I
can't believe like their but ring lights
everywhere in view the community but
Shannon its oceanic so obsessing over
her videos like the way she talks and he
send her lighting and her background and
I just I was so sort of drawn in and
sort of like how did she do that so then
I found her setup video with her
lighting and her camera and everything
and um I saw that she was using two
umbrella lights to light up the
background I was like I love my
background I love the twinkling lights
and I know Christmas is over and dealt
with but I want to keep my twinkling
lights because I love for twinkling
lights I love the purple and the peach
there but I wanted something new because
I've been dealing with a dark background
for ever now I've been doing YouTube for
almost 60 years now five and a half at
this point and I've always had dark
backgrounds so when I saw that Shannon
lit her background up with a
hello light I was like that's perfect
solution so I ordered the same eBay sort
of umbrella lights that Shannon has and
I put them up and I actually I kinda
really do like it what I really like
about it is that um colors of my
skintone and colors of makeup sort of
pop a little bit more whereas before you
had the dark background and I was as
light as snow and then you sort of it
was like too much contrast and I feel
like with this background you sort of
have more like an angelic feeling and
sort of more a pop of color like you can
really see what I look like and maybe
that's a really bad thing but I kind of
do like it I also I noticed that in all
my videos this side of my face was
lighter I never understood why basically
I was gonna get new lights for my
background so I was like I'm just gonna
replace these two as well I have a
softbox here and a directional light
here um and I know it's it is so stupid
I noticed that this softbox light had
like 40 W what we call it what in
Holland so this had 40 watts and then
the directional light at 12 so I was
like oh that's why all of those years
this side was light and this side was
not so light so uh please say hi please
welcome my new background lights and my
sort of new feeling of nikkietutorials
and I hope you enjoy please let me know
what you think it's definitely a really
good sort of change for now and I really
like that and um yeah before you ask
this is a makeup tutorial I just
recorded for a collab with Chloe Morello
and that is going to be uploaded this
Tuesday I'm so excited Chloe Morello has
been one of my favorite youtubers for so
long and I just I love everything she
puts up and we text a lot together and
we're going to I'm it's London together
so I was like let's do a collab together
so this is my look for the clip it's a
really a smokey eye it has a denim blue
eyeliner which I love and it just adds
that pop of color so this
look we'll be going up on Tuesday and
then I will give you a kind of a sneak
peek it's cold first it's warm sort of
and if you know what I mean then sort of
think where I live and where Chloe lives
I'm not going to give away anything else
but this Tuesday those videos will go up
and I'm just so honored to work with
Chloe and just collab with her and I
love her and clips so you don't have to
ask me what is on my lips or what is on
my eyes you will all see this Tuesday
speaking of Tuesday how are you liking
the new uploading schedule two videos
per week it's uh it's been a little bit
hard for me to kind of keep up but uh so
far right now I have I have mastered it
and I'm doing good and I'm really liking
I like the sort of steadiness that um
like I just know when to upload and I
know when to edit and you know when to
film and just it's it's it's definitely
a really good feeling to have that
schedule and have you guys know that two
times a week on Tuesday and Friday
you'll have a new video from me and then
also kind of brings me to an early oh
god know for January is that a lot of my
videos have not been showing up in your
subscription boxes and it kind of pisses
me off because I work hard on my videos
and it put a lot of effort into them the
December it's and God knows did not show
up in your sub boxes I have a feeling
but I'm not too sure that my fashion
milk behind-the-scenes video did not get
in your subscription boxes in my last
video with my good good friend Joyce I
have a feeling the didn't show up your
sub boxes either and I'm not complaining
I'm definitely not complaining I'm just
pissed off that people don't see what I
put up because I put so much effort into
it on a regular my videos get about
55,000 views or higher and um these two
videos like the fashion look one is at
23,000 which is amazing and so much and
um the video with Joyce which is a
Yankee Candle haul is now at 17,000 I
believe and I feel like 55,000 17,000 I
feel
it's not in your subscription boxes and
I'm not here to bind it but oh my god
I'm not getting enough view to know I'm
just pissed off because I want people to
see those videos because um I only put
up videos that I personally really like
and if I don't like something I don't
upload it so everything that I've put up
here on my channel it's something that
I'm proud of that I'm happy with and
then when people can see that or can't
like receiving from their subscription
box it just pisses me off to fix this
you can go to manage subscriptions here
on your YouTube account and then you
search for me nikkietutorials and then
you have this option for email
notification and you check that on so
when you want an email every time I
upload something you check that on and
once my videos up you'll get an email
with like- toriel's uploaded bah bah bah
bah bah bah ok so enough with that I
left my agency the agency who I was with
for makeup and hair assignments and jobs
and shoot such shows and TV stuff and
everything I left that agency um it's
sort of a private matter so I won't go
into detail too much but let's just keep
it at it wasn't working any longer I had
to follow my heart and sort of listen to
what my heart was telling me and my
heart was telling me to go so after like
months of crying and not feeling myself
I decided to leave my agency and to no
longer work with them and that was
really hard because the the owner of
that agency is the woman who taught me
makeup who taught me the things of the
world in makeup and she taught me so
many things and it was so heartbreaking
for me to kind of leave her and leave my
fun colleagues I was with them for two
and a half years and it was time for me
to go and um that brings me to the next
part so by leaving that agency that also
means that I left B Academy
and this is really hard for me because I
love to teaching but I am no longer a
teacher at the Academy in Amsterdam so
um if you're going there to learn makeup
from me I won't be going there anymore I
won't be teaching there anymore you
won't see me there anymore
I've been getting a lot of emails about
hey I wanted to I'm from this in that
country and I want to fly over and stay
in Amsterdam for a couple of months to
go to the Academy and to learn makeup
from you now of course I highly suggest
going to be Academy is one of the best
makeup schools in Holland but if you
wanted to go there to learn makeup from
me um I would say do not do it because
I'm not there anymore
but hopefully one day I will have the
possibility to start my own Academy /
school and then you can all fly over you
can all sort of learn makeup from you in
real life and everything so I know in my
last vlog I talked about lip injections
and a couple of videos after that I got
questions like did you get the lip
injections because your lips look
plumper and fuller well thank you so
much that you say that they look plumper
and fuller but they actually don't
because I never got the lip injections
although Chloe Morello just put up a
video on a new technique of sort of
applying fillers to the lips and um that
really that really caught my eye because
I was like ooh now that look is good I
don't know like I have full lips from
myself like my lips are really full but
I just want my top lip to be a little
bit fuller just a little bit more so
yeah that is all I have for you today
this is fun I should do this more often
maybe I should do one every month thank
you guys so much for watching if you
want to follow me on twitter facebook
Instagram that all is sneaky tutorials
you know it by now
thank you and uh hopefully I will see
you guys this is going up tonight
hopefully I will see you guys on Tuesday
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
