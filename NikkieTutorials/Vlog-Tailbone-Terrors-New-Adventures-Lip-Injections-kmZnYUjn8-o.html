NOT here with a makeup tutorial not here
with a giveaway I'm not here with hair
tutorial story or whatever I'm here to
talk I missed you guys and I know I've
been kind of slacking on the videos and
sort of like the tutorials but I miss
you guys
so before you guys ask the makeup that
I'm wearing it's for a session ista
Magazine tutorial it's how to make your
I cannot tell you that in about two or
three months so this will be in the
magazine and then on my blog as well I
always post all the fashionista
tutorials on my blog and making
tutorials calm so just to get that out
of the way so how are you guys doing I
have been really hectic my life has been
really sort of crazy hectic and lots of
fun things and also lots not so fun
things let's start with the negative
stuff I guess I have bruised my tailbone
and I have rooted for like two years ago
and that because I sat wrong I went to
go down on a chair and then I I kind of
it just was really weird i sat down in
the wrong position and then I couldn't
sit anymore and then took a couple of
weeks to get away and then for years
like two years I didn't have any
problems with my tailbone whatsoever it
always was a little bit sensitive but
not like I can't sit on it and then ever
since last week Saturday it's just
excruciating it's just so bad the pain
is so bad I'm high on like ibuprofen and
 right now and I have this sort of
pillow that gives it rest but it's so
annoying because you have this like
constant pain in your ass and it's so
annoying in a dress you like mentally it
drives you so crazy and tired but
hopefully in a couple of weeks that will
be gone I don't think it's broken
because I read on the internet that if
it's broken you almost pass out from the
pain I have pain but do not pass out
from it I think that's it for all the
negative I I have fun stuff to
share with you guys
sort of like I've been wanting to tell
you I told you guys on Twitter this
morning I've been lately for the last
couple of four or five months I've been
thinking about getting upper lip
injections and I'm ready for the piles
of to get thrown at me right now
but I just love the look of that I've
seen Chloe Murillo here on YouTube I've
seen so many people on dr. 90210 on e I
like my lips a lot I think my lips are
okay but I just want my top lip to have
a little bit more fullness
I just want my top lip to do this I just
want my top lip to be a little bit more
volume than plus so for the last four or
five months I've been really sort of
like daily thinking about it and trying
to like do the duck face and see what it
will look like did I just I think it's
not like it's not permanent it goes away
after like a couple of months so if I
don't like it in a couple of months it
will be gone and nothing has ever
happened but I just I kind of feel like
I need to do this too like if it's good
I'm gonna be like so happy that it's
good and if it's bad it's like lesson
learned never again and I know plastic
surgery and all that kind of shizzle is
a little bit is a whistle here I use it
I mean like so many gurus have gotten
plastic surgery by now and I'm like I'm
the only one left out I want it so my
question to you is have you ever gotten
lip injections if so what is your
experience and do you still have them
and what's just tell me about it another
thing I want to talk about is that I I
believe in always renewing yourself
I always there's this one philosophy
that I sort of live by is that you're
never done learning every day you'll
learn something new is it from like
personal experience work experience
every day you learn something new and as
they makeup and hair artist I always
feel like especially an hour sort of
branch of work it never stops there's
always new
pens there's always new colors and
always these sort of new techniques and
there's always more to learn and in
Holland here you do not get booked for
makeup alone in Holland you have to be
able to do hair and makeup so yes if
you're perfect with makeup fine great
for you but you're not getting booked
because in Holland you need to be able
to do hair and makeup because if not
you're too expensive to get booked and
then bye-bye so what if we know this
thing a lot lately is that my hair
skills are not what they're supposed to
be um it's kind of hard for me to say
that because I've been working in this
industry for three four years now and
for three four years every time I'm on
set like with makeup I'm like come on
come at me I can do anything when it
comes to make up almost everything not
everything but when the time comes for
me to do the hair I get this sort of
like insecure feeling in my tummy and
it's just like you're gonna fudge this
up Nikki and I'm done with that feeling
I don't want that feeling anymore and um
I thought that it's time for me to
really get on my hair game and really
learn how to do good photoshoot hair so
starting on the first of September I'm
gonna follow the hair course at we are
agency that's an Amsterdam and I'm I'm
really excited but I'm kind of scared
too because I don't want to fail and
it's it's an exciting sort of new phase
in my life I really want to get the hang
of hair I will not be at the academy on
Sundays anymore because I will be at we
are Agency to learn hair but I will be
teaching at the academy on Mondays now
so from Sunday I went to Monday and that
also is really new for me because on
Monday there's a lot of traffic to
Amsterdam and I hate traffic so that's
gonna be a whole new buzz for me did you
guys have any new sort of life goals or
are you like ready to learn something
new or what did you learn today just
leave it in the comment section below I
just want to make this video sort of
like a talk with each other video
because I missed you guys
I did one day of Hollins exhale model we
did the press shoots so the press
releases and the promo images and all
that kind of stuff I did makeup on the
girls and I will show you some pictures
right now I did four lovely girls and
they're all beautiful in my eyes and I
love doing the makeup and we had this
really really fun location which will
you be able to see next Monday so for my
Dutchess if you want to see the new
season of Holland sex humble that starts
this Monday on August the 26th on RTL 5
at 9:30 you might see my hands doing
some makeup or just anything like that I
was wearing neon green nail polish so
I've been busy with like makeup jobs and
just kind of renewing myself I've been
busy with my boyfriend because I still
have my boyfriend I still love him and I
know I get so many requests to get him
in front of the camera to do the
boyfriend does my makeup tag or the
boyfriend tag whatever the tag with the
boyfriend included in it I'm really
trying but he doesn't want to go in
front of the camera he just doesn't like
cameras that much so I I'm just like
daily on the daily basis I'm like when
should we do the boyfriend does my
makeup bag and then he's like we're not
doing it I'm really trying guys but yeah
he might not turn around on this one
next week on my channel nikkietutorials
it's gonna be a fun week because Lady
Gaga came out with her new music video
applause which I absolutely love the
song the music video was awesome it was
just like Gaga went through vogue saw
some inspirational pictures and was like
okay I'm gonna do all of that in one
video so next week on my channel I'm
gonna do three videos inspired by the
applause music video and I'm gonna call
it Lady Gaga applause week on
nikkietutorials other than that I really
think that's it I'm really hungry now it
is about 4:30 now and I'm gonna go drive
off to my best friend and we're gonna
have french fries and just all this kind
of
unhealthy stuff so yeah think again so
much for watching I hope you guys
