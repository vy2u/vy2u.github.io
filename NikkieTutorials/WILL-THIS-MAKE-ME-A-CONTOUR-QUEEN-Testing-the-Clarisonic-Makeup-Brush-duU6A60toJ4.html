something you need to know about me
actually if you've been following me on
my channel for a little bit you know
that I cannot cream contour and it pains
me everyday I am confronted by Instagram
makeup artist cream contouring the shit
out of their faces you know and every
time I see these posts I it hurts me I'm
in pain because in my head I know that I
will never be able to do that until my
subscription box a couple of weeks ago
transformed into ten videos about the
Clarisonic foundation brush I am
convinced I have watched about every
video that has been made about this
every video shows me that foundation
goes on beautifully and people love it
for that but the number one reason
people love this right here is because
it blends in cream contouring like
nothing else before and watching those
videos all I could think was really
really it is finally happened to me so
yeah saying my life depends on this tool
is putting it nicely I am just really
excited about this when I saw all these
videos I had to have it so I got my
hands on the Clarisonic Mia 2 and the
foundation brush so in today's video I
want to see if I can go from cream
contouring trash to a cream contouring
queen all using this device right here I
think if I feel like I have to show you
what it used to be like I'm going to do
one side using a sponge the sucky way
and it's going to be my first time
trying this out seeing if it works for
my skin in my face as well and we're
just going to have fun and see if I can
go from trash to terrific so I brought
you a nice up close and personal so you
can see every little nook and cranny on
the states all right so this recently
came in this is my Smashbox and it is
called the studio skin shaping
foundation and what this is is one side
is a foundation stick and the other side
is a soft contour so I thought this
would be perfect for this video because
we have two Sundays
in the contouring all-in-one so this
isn't this the why this ladies and
gentlemen is 0.5 and it is orange as why
effects a warm toned in what world is a
point sized person that warm tone all
right never mind we're just going to use
the contour for that for a foundation
I'm just going to stick to the youth
so for foundation today I'm going to go
in with the Lancome patty doll ultra
we're in 104 a little bit of extra
coverage this donessa my Rick's vision
cream cover oh wait but first primer Jay
one jelly pack this is the business okay
here we go
yes coverage
where is that so wide um I would love to
tell you why my foundation is looking so
white on camera today but there's no I
don't know we're just gonna have to live
with it all right let's do a little bit
of concealing and then we're going to
play okay
so my entire face is now a blank canvas
so this is what my face looks like after
primer a lot of foundation and concealer
now it's time for the moment of truth is
the Clarisonic the ultimate tool to do
cream contouring with I'm going to do
one side using a sponge so you can see
where it goes wrong for me and once I
using the Clarisonic so we can compare
okay let's start off with the Smashbox
stick oh I cannot explain to you how
unnatural it feels for me to do this
feels bad okay forehead cream contouring
I am as you can see I'm really really
fair and when I cream contour or just
powder contour my forehead too much I
look like I've been playing in the mud
since 1994 oh oh oh god oh god oh this
is going to be terrible
I am not touching the note2 cream
contouring the nose on me soon all right
so what I would usually do now grab my
sponge and work it in but listen it's
not going to work in so I'm gonna start
diffusing she's already happening what
it does for me is it grabs the product
picks it up in the sponge keeps it for
like a couple of seconds and then it's
like oh I can drop it up here and what
happens is I get a really uneven
patchy mess although this this is not
too bad look ridiculous already oh god
oh god I am in a crucifying pain see
that's what I mean okay that is canceled
I'm hoping I am praying that the
Clarisonic is going to do wonders on
this side so it can bruise this light up
a little bit as well alright Clarisonic
I choose you
okay here we go
oh wow okay whoa
first thing I'm noticing is that it's
shedding so when I compare the
Clarisonic side to my side it keeps the
product way more concentrated and in one
place the blended out so you still get a
lot of definition but it's moved out I'm
also really really happy that it didn't
mess up my foundation underneath usually
when I run into with external products /
tools is that they mess up my foundation
underneath so much that my redness comes
back through but not here okay Wow
okay I'm not mad at that so going and
with a little bit of foundation to
soften the edges I'm not mad at this at
all look how far down the sponge took my
contour and here it is still in place
and snatched until
you
I do want to note that I'm barely
touching my skin like I'm really letting
that tool glide over my face what I that
is not that oh my god what um yeah I
don't think it's that hard to see the
difference like you can see that it's
more concentrated but blended out and
still in place and here just kind of one
everywhere and I look like trash I'm not
broke okay okay now fix this side for me
please fix it oh that tickles
oh my god it's like I'm massaging my
eyes with a dildo alright I'm not going
to set everything with powder to to seal
the deal but so far so good
oh hey I'm home alone and do my makeup
and aboard so I'm just putting on the
camera to talk to you but here are my
eyes finished and this is what my skin
looks like after doing the powder and
like eyebrows and everything and this is
how much of the contour shines through
with all the powder on top and you know
I use a lot of powder so I must say that
I am pretty damn obsessed with the look
of this contour right now down a
day-to-day basis yes I do wear more
contour than this so I will have to go
over top with a powder contour to make
it all a little bit more intense so I'm
going to go in with a little bit of hula
light and the hoola brush by benefit to
add a little bit more warmth to the
complexion and to Rhian tents aside a
little bit more of a contour see yes I
think I am most surprised about my
forehead like usually cream contouring
the forehead is going to make me a look
just going to make me look like dirt and
I feel like now I finally have that like
instagram-worthy bronzed forehead for
highlighter today I do want to play with
the new Bali highlighter by Oprah I know
this is going to be too warm for me so
I'm kind of going to use it as an
underlying base forever globe
so volley is definitely really warm on
my fair skin tone but I kind of like how
it makes the blush can pop and then
because I'm obsessed and clearly I've
got issues going back in with ever glow
then for lips we're going to go in with
the kylie vacation collection velvet
liquid lipstick in the colour bear
and I do want to be very glossy and
summery today so I'm going to go in with
this right here this is by Becca it's
called the liquid crystal glow gloss in
the color sand pane dream a Bellini you
see that
it's alright guys so my face is done and
this is what the end result looks like
using the Clarisonic foundation brush
also used for cream contouring by most
people now here's what I'm thinking I
think this tool in and of itself amazing
the way it blended up my contour amazing
but at the end of this road I'm
questioning myself if I'm a cream
contour person I find myself having to
go back in with powders after two-ring
intensify the intensity of it and while
I'm added why go in with a cream contour
you know when I can do it all with
powder that's stupid I'm making this
entire video about wanting to be a cream
contour queen and now that I have the
possibility to become one I don't know
if it's for me if it's intense enough
for me because your girl likes a contour
if I have to go back in with a powder to
make it more intense why not do
everything with powder plus another
thing that really ties it in for me as
well is that the clarisonic mia is
expensive it's 169 dollars and then I
believe $35 for just the foundation head
as well that's a lot of money for
something that I'm going to intensify
with powder later on anyways is it a
great product does it work absolutely is
it necessary now I am thankful did this
product that it's given me more
confidence in cream contouring whenever
I see someone cream contouring now
online I'm like I can do that too with
this I don't know guys what do you think

down in the comment section down below
if you think this is worth all the money

let me on the comments down below
