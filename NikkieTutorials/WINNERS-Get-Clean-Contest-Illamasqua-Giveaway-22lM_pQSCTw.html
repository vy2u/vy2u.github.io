video for the winners of my get clean
context and the Illamasqua giveaway but
before I do that there's an app on like
the iPad and iPhone and it would like it
records when you talk in your sleep and
when you make weird noises but I got the
wrong one so I got the one where you
couldn't upload your like weird sound to
the Internet um I did get the new one
though but I just wanted to let you hear
like this night what I did is so freakin
scary to hear yourself talking your
sleep just one more time it's like I'm
getting possessed and then I'm like
throwing it out again okay that's enough
jibber-jabber um today I'm here to
announce the winners for all my
giveaways and stuff like that last week
on Thursday
it was my three year anniversary on
YouTube um I've been on YouTube for
three years now I just want to say thank
you so much for believing me for
watching me for having fun with me um
we're at 97 thousand subscribers it's
insane and I told a friend of mine once
once I reach 100,000 subscribers which
is going to be like never I'm gonna do a
collection video and now it might
actually happen let's start off with the
winner of the illamasqua contest to give
away the winner already has been
contacted so it has no use for you to
just create a new account with something
like the name no she already knows she
won and she already has surprises I
think but the winner of the illamasqua
giveaway of the medium eye pencils is
Sarah
Zoe style and she has been contacted
already so Sarah congratulations I hope
you love the pencils as much as I do I
am obsessed with them I'm sure you're
gonna like them so congressional
separately get clean contest it was a
hard one um I was planning on giving
away one Scrabble ring but it ended up
having like over a thousand comments a
couple of video responses it was insane
and all the like homes were so
inspirational and I'm so proud of you
guys for telling yourself why you are
beautiful it just touched me so much
some of them even made me cry because I
always do I even cry with Pokemon
instead of a1 Scrabble ring I'm gonna
give away three I did it this way um I
chose one comment that I liked best
I did one random comment and one random
video response because with the video
responses and what it's it felt like
really like wrong to me to choose one
video response because she was the
prettiest without makeup no so I just
hit that randomly and as well as a
comment and then one comment I really
liked so here we go here are the get
clean contest winners the winner for the
comment that I picked is from Miss
anonymous 57 and her comment was I am
beautiful because I am me and no one
else now I know that a lot of people set
this in the comments and I'm so proud of
you for saying that you are beautiful
because you are you but she was the
first one with that comment so she had
to win because she was the first one
with this so that's the most fair to me
then for the video response this was
random
as I told because it felt wrong to me
just to choose one the winner is C and 2
0 0 9 8 and she was just too cute she
was so if she kept on smiling throughout
the entire video and that
it was just too cute and then for the
last winner which is the random comment
winner and I had this on my phone
because there was a long comment I loved
it so the winner of the random comment
is some part when to pronounce it sub L
o c.h.l.i
who luckily lovely because I'm 19 years
old
a little chubbier than the others and
I'm a damn proud of it baby if I walk
down the street I see just tiny girls
made out of bones and skin and all
wearing the same clothes
for me going out there and showing
everybody that I'm happy with my weight
even if I do not fit into their schemes
makes me feel beautiful that touched me
the hell out I'm really proud of you
holy luckily now if you didn't win
please don't shoot me please don't make
plans do you like this and a bomb to me
or something I just it was too hard
over 100,000 comments the giveaway also
