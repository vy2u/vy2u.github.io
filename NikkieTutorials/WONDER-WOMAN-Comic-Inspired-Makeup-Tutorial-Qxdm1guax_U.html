on and I'm mostly inspired by the comic
and to celebrate the premiere of the new
Wonder Woman movie I wanted to do
something to celebrate because there's a
female director and they broke records
and I think us as females should be
really really proud of this and this is
my way of celebrating by paying homage
to her character in the comics also I'd
like you to know that yes I am naked no
I've got I just had so much fun with
this look right here I think it's
perfect for a DC Comics party for
Halloween for if you want to go see the
movie without all the stripes it's a
really fun look to do so without any
further ado if you would like to know
has gets this Wonder Woman comic look
right here then keep on watching all
right let's get this Wonder Woman looks
started first we go in with this oil by
she way this is called the daily
clarifying treatment oil and I've been
really liking this to sort of hydrate my
face before we go in with all the layers
oh what a missed opportunity I should
have dropped it on my face like
Instagram I will never be a professional
for foundation today i'ma go in with my
trusty Lancome pan
easel alter 24 hour makeup in the color
100 ivory neutral I am going to change
the application up a little bit though I
saw someone use a Mac 169 brush for
foundation and I was fascinated because
I've never seen this brush used for
foundation just for contouring and blush
so why not tested bad boy for the base
this is really scary to me because I
haven't used a brush for foundation in
months see I'm not really in love with
this because it leaves streaks I will
never understand how people can still
use a brush because it leaves me streaky
I never mind we need to sponge up in the
air flip get rid of the streaky does are
we seriously if you can do a flawless
base with a brush I bow down to you I I
just don't know how you do it without
the streaking for concealer today might
arest see my beloved shape tape by tarts
and I'm going to make my undereyes to
make sure there's no creasing throughout
the day plus it's nice and highlighted
first thing first for the eyes if you
want your eyes to last whatever you're
doing with this look you know if you're
into fetish don't talk to me so in
order to make sure that this look will
last all day long you need a base this
is Mac soft ochre Paint Pot use it and
I'll go them into one of my all-time
favorite palettes the morphe 35o are and
taking these two colors for in the
crease and when I makeup Shack blender
brush I'm just going to define the
crease with this and blow it out and
we're going all the way towards the
inner corner using these shadows if you
want depth everywhere and now you might
be thinking maybe what happened you used
to be my fave and now you can't even
blend your edges that's because I've
been using this new technique recently
where you just apply the color with one
brush and then the magic trick is to go
in with a clean blending brush and
diffuse the edges and I've been really
liking this way of working recently it
just blows out the edges so perfectly
and traceless Lee I love just going back
and forth on that line
back and forth and soften it baby
basically what this technique has done
for me is I become much more confident
in my blending skills now when I have a
color that is really daring and in my
mind I go home about how the hell I'm
going to ever blend this out I know that
with this technique I only need a clean
blending brush to go over the edges and
make them trace force and it just works
it's like magic so for anyone out there
who is insecure about their blending
just get a clean blending brush go over
the edges and everything will blend like
magic it works every time now I'm going
to back in and Riaan ten suffice some of
that crease work because with blending
you have the tendency to loose almost
power or of the color and all you have
to do is simply go back in and reinforce
it I'm highlighting my brow bone and
inner corners using nylon by Mac as the
base for my gold shadow on the lid of
first gonna go in with this milk makeup
eye pigment and hotel lobby and on a Mac
242 I'm really going to cut out where I
want the gold to go and I'm going to
stop about halfway in this will give you
a fabulous half-cup crease look for the
gold of using this luscious shade from
the 35 our palette as well
and just like with the crius you want to
blend out the edges softly into the
brown all right pipe for a killer wing
this is by Oprah it's the fix line
eyeliner gel in black and I start my
liner off on the inside part of my eye
and work my way outwards you can make
your wing as thick or thin as you want I
like a big fat one so that's what I'm
doing today not to enhance that cartoon
feel and go over to the blink ultra-thin
liquid eyeliner pen and with this I'm
cutting my crease very delicately that
comes the trickiest part of this entire
eye look we're going to create a new
inner corner like this first I'm going
in with NYX white liquid liner to trace
where I want my new inner corner to be
after that I'm going back in with my
blink eyeliner pen and start up tracing
the outside and if there's a brand out
there that you know that makes a white
liner that doesn't crack like this NYX
one I love the coverage but look if
cracks and it crumbles so I have to go
over that to get rid of all these like
weird crack looking things going back
into the morphe 35o our palette and
taking this color adhere to smoke out
the lower lash line
and with a smaller more precise brush
delicately bring that towards your new
inner corner and with the blank line
your pen I'm just going to trace a soft
line at the roots of my lashes all right
time to seal the deal on these eyes I'm
going to be applying the new bouncing
Bella lashes all right time for some of
the necessary cheek stuff and after that
we'll have fun so first we're going to
bronze my face up because I'm giving
castor a run first money but also
keeping in mind all the cartoonish lines
will be adding later on you want to get
those lines a little bit of depth
although it's 2d and very flat I'm going
to get the optical illusion as if
there's like a filter of two divas on
top of me makes no sense but it does in
my head all right tiny bit of contouring
to add to the illusion for blushing a
little with a little touch of pink this
is well peachy pink this is Kylie barely
legal and forego I wanted to go with
something very golden and unusual and
I'm going to go for the makeup addiction
cosmetic holy glow Volume one and it's
got these beautiful colors and do you
see this golden sheen one uh-huh we're
going to blend with that
holy Sh I fish my freaking Lord
Amazonian craziness oh my god okay we're
done I can't function anymore
we're going to do pop art lips and a pop
our face so by all means you can do a
red lip with this and you're done call
it a day and go to the movies and see
Wonder Woman and support this or if you
want to do this for let's say Halloween
or a party costume party now is the time
to bust out the fun stuff the liners and
create a pop art base so I'm going in
with this liquid lipstick by morphe
called morphe now using that same gel
liner by ultra I'm going to outline that
all right now it's time to add our
highlights using the creme Li NYX white
liquid liner again and major shadow
- Jordan Hans without her and her
guidance I would have never been able to
come near this so all kind of goes to
Jordan for this so now that we've got
that it is time to add pop our details
with black lines to our face and
anywhere there's a prominent shadow is
where you want to add a line
and of course some highlights at first
are going to outline her crown using
black and fill in with a gold water
activated paint this part of sonar
before and tarnish oh my god it kind of
looks like a really where you to brow
and to finish of course the red star all
right time for a wig and we're done and
that guy's concludes this Wonder Woman
strip cartoon character inspired makeup

Halloween or like I said whatever set is
