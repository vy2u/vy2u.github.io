tutorials and I am back here with a new
video for you something no I am not
wearing anything on my lips except for
foundation today but all for a very good
reason because today I'll be showing you
the brand spankin new Pat McGrath matte
trans lipsticks and this one is really
special to me because Pat McGrath is my
idol if you don't know who Pappa Grethe
is she is the one who invented pretty
much all the trends she has done all the
covers of all the magazines she is for
pretty much most of the fashion shows
like the big fashion shows the creative
director behind the looks she is the
mother of makeup so Piper Graf has
always been my number one inspiration
like her creativity is out of this world
so when I got the chance to fill with
her a couple of months ago to be Serpico
plus-sized model for her campaign for a
new launch that she was doing it
literally felt like working with my
personal God so it doesn't come as a
surprise that I screamed really loudly
when Pat asked me to come back for a
second video focusing on the matte trans
lipsticks so a couple of weeks ago I
went back to New York City and filmed
another campaign flash video with Pat
and her team have actually gifted me the
matte trans lipsticks that day and Here
I am today
pretty much just showcasing you the new
colors and how they look on my lips and
what I think of them and just all of
that good stuff in a little playtime
video as always my opinions are
completely and 100% my own if I do not
like a color or I do not like the
consistency you'll be the first to know
I even told Pat her pink highlighter in
the past has never been a huge huge
favorite of mine and it actually wasn't
oh god no so that kind of tells you that
you know I am not bullshitting you guys
yeah without any further ado I think
it's time to look at these pretty pretty
beautiful babies right here and try up
on the lips all right so welcome to my
face I'm James Dean James and this is
transform indicating yes the
foundation lifts will be gone in a
little bit so looking at these brand new
lipsticks by Pat McGrath first of all
the packaging is out of this world it is
luxurious it is chic it is high-class
and just beautiful now I'll tell you
right off the bat my favorite favorite
part about this entire collection and
this is this is what makes Pat a genius
as you can see when you hold the bullet
the lips the gold lips are up front and
when creating this design Pat told me
that she always wanted the gold lips
right up front when someone is applying
the lipstick so what she did is she had
new machines made to do the following
usually when you twist up a lipstick is
just twist up like this and the lipstick
comes out so if you twist the gold part
of the lipstick it comes out straight so
all right let me show you that again so
when you have the gold lips up front
twist the gold part twist it twist it
twisted and the lipstick comes out
straight I do want to know though
because when I first opened these I was
like oh my god let me try that again and
I twisted the black part when you twist
the black part it comes out naturally
but when you twist out the gold it comes
out like magic and you have to lips up
front
when you apply the lipstick I think it's
genius the lipsticks are going to be
sold in sets of three or in a set with
all the colors plus as singles so
there's a set of three mutes which is
called skin show it also comes with a
bright set and this one is called color
blitz and then the last set is all about
the vampy dark colors and this one is
called vicious venom so enough talking
about the lipsticks let's get down to
the action and actually apply them onto
the lips I'm going to be starting off
with the nude set and I'm going to be
starting off with the color 1995 usually
when I do lipstick swatches on camera I
put a layer of foundation on because I
have really pigmented lips myself but a
lot of you have told me that you're
scared that that will alter like the
finish or the application of the
lipstick so for today's video I'm going
to take everything off my lips and just
fill it in over a bear lips and
my lips are so pigmented this will right
up the bat tell you if the lipstick is
committed or not
all right foundation off time to apply
the first color so that is my top lip
done and what I can tell is that the
formula is really really thin but packed
with pigment so this is what 1995 looks
like on me definitely one of those my
lips live better shade it resembles my
natural lip color a lot it's just a
little bit more Brown and muted I
totally did colors like this on the lips
they're natural and nude but it still
gives the lips some staff so I really
like this color and what's the word
about this lipstick is that it feels
really thin like it barely feels like
you're wearing anything but it's packed
with color intensity so yes next color
is ohmy inspired by Naomi Campbell
and here's what Oh me looks like on me
it's more of a red nude neutral I
personally myself think it looks long
with this I look right here and the
entire look going on so this is a more
vibrant nude color and formerly a
texture wise it's just the same as 1995
it is a little bit creamier and you can
tell by the little bit of extra shine on
the lips when finished so this one is
the little creamier still beautiful
nebula
next day line is flesh three and this to
me looks like a straight-up dark reddish
burgundy color this by no means will be
a nude on my skin tone but on deeper
complexions this can be phenomenal as a
nude
pregnant honestly the pigment undies are
just insane
one slice as I kind of predicted this is
a very vampy dark burgundy reddish color
on me I love this I love this for fall
for winter for nights out also as I'm
taking them off
I see no no staining that's that's my
natural lip color so I budged up the
line of my foundation a little bit so
I'm going to go in with a little bit of
concealer and just kind of fade the line
oh I love this so much more I love this
so much more I feel like whenever I put
lipstick over top of really nude lips
she's gonna pop no we can't do it
because no gosh let's go over to the
bride set against out with this one
Elson which is a beautiful crimson red
whoa it just glides on I mean it's
honestly a swipe swipe done it's so
packed with pigments trust me I want to
be critical on these lipsticks I want to
be critical and give you parts of it
that I don't like the only reason for
now that I can think of you not liking
this lipstick is because you do not like
lipstick very it looks like Christmas on
my face isn't this the classic Christmas
makeup look a little bit of glitter
neutral smoky eye red lips mmm all I
need is like Christmas lights in the
backdrop so okay here we have full panic
which is a bright ass fuchsia
it looks a little bit more red on me
than I initially expected it's still a
very fun party color I know some of your
going to ask like why are you acting so
surprised about the formula and like the
colors and the consistency I only wore
three colors for the video with path and
I didn't wear the others my lips were
done by Pat herself or her amazing
amazing makeup artist Adam so I didn't
get to play with them myself actually
applying them onto my lips myself so
hence why I'm loving this experience and
loving seeing all these colors okay last
in line obsessed with an exclamation
point at the end
oh I love this color so much it brings
me back to that day it reminds me of
lady danger by Mac in color a lot and I
think this is one of those perfect
summer colors to really you know get
that Sun on your body and I think this
is one of those colors that looks
amazing on fair skin tones medium what's
in between
dark deep deep dark the deepest dark it
looks good on everybody it's gone they
go on beautifully they go off
beautifully without sinning it's all
right time for the dark colors now I
feel like we're finally going to hit a
critical point of the video because if
there's one thing that a lot of brands
do wrong it's dark vampy colors they
always go like you need two coats or 16
you need to wear a lip liner underneath
please brands always ask us to do more
for it because they're hard they're
insanely hard to nail and like they're
they're hard to apply so the first color
gonna go in with is antidote and this is
beautiful purple okay moment of truth
finally a critical point why he arty is
so good
okay so we finally have found one color
that's not completely opaque like the
other in one go so this does need a
second swipe once it's on is beautiful
and purple and intense but this one does
need a little bit more of action going
over top so we have finally found a flaw
a feedback link an antidote that it is
just the smidgen tiniest bit less
pigmented than the other one here we
have deep void oh my god is that is that
black it looks like a very cool set and
like suede very purple like deep darker
it's pretty much black no notes not
black on the lips it's a very deep deep
deep dark purple Wow suddenly this video
got so emo I definitely noticed a
difference compared to the others and
it's even creamier than Oh me and I
don't remember what other color that was
but it's even creamier than that and
with this one I see a little bit
actually let me finish this look before
I judge this one is definitely the
creamiest I do see a little breakdown of
pigment right at the edge of the lips I
feel like this one is a little too
creamy for the color this is the only
one I am a little bit afraid of running
or moving whereas with the others it's
thin and light and satiny matte where I
feel like it's secure enough for a
lipstick but this one I feel like
eventually it's going to go places it's
it's my lip color again it's crazy
how these do not stay okay last one up
the bunch the nice color is mcmenamy's i
no idea what that means
and this one is my favorite of the dark
set I feel like if there's what let me
let me just save this until my end
conclusion it's less of that creaminess
that we just have with deep void and for
the wealth of color looks really fun
okay so here we are and I just put on
obsessed again because I think obsessed
is my favorite color because I so
overall when I look at these lipsticks I
see beautiful packaging very forward and
innovative thinking by getting the
lipstick bullet up straight up so you
have the lips always up front when
applying the lipstick I know I set this
like a million times in this video
already but again the formula and this
one is like pure lipstick magic
it's absolutely non drying on the lips
and after swatching all nine of them and
I list feel fine sharpening when I have
just watched nine Kylie cosmetics liquid
lipsticks my lips will literally fall
off and to never be seen again
here are a couple of things that could
make or break your decision to buy these
or try these or not in all honesty I
think that deep void was the weakest
contender out of the bunch with antidote
being a runner-up for that title
all others are creamy and tensed and
super fun to work with
another thing that's crucial is that
these are high-end lipsticks now I am
NOT able to look into your wallet or
look into your lifestyle but singles
retail for $38 now that is a lot of
money for lipstick money that I am
willing to spend on this lipstick
because this is truly and I'm not
bullshitting you right now this is truly
one of the best lipstick formulas I've
ever tried in my life but $38 is a lot
of money for lipstick and I'll let you
be the judge of that if you think that
is too much you think that is too much
if you think that is worth it do you
think that is worth it everyone is so
personal when it comes to high-end
makeup or luxury makeup and everyone is
different some stick to drugstore some
stick to high-end and I will let you be
the judge of that me personally I think
it's
now with that said trio's retailed for
$95 and if you want all the lipsticks in
one bundle you will pay 275 dollars so
that is for all of them so overall if
you ask me these are an insane
recommendation they are a luxury gift
and they are packed with lipstick magic
I am I am pretty much in love with you
so these babies right here go in pre
seal tomorrow on petha grats calm they
are available July 19th at Pat McGrath
calm so that's no more pre still they'll
