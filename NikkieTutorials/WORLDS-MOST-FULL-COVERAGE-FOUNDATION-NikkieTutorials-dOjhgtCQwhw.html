requested and exciting video I'm gonna
be trying world's most full coverage
foundation what oh how could I be so
rude Mia I wanted to say hi everybody
so this foundation right here has been
buzzing the web and somehow I just never
got around to trying it out but like as
the months progressed I got more and
more requests for it so here is finally
here's the day here's the day where I
finally try out world's most full
coverage foundation so the foundation is
by the brand derma Col derma called film
studio the Randolph prog makeup cover it
claims to be waterproof but has an SPF
of 30 and hypoallergenic there's one
thing I want to say before we start off
I got so many tweets from derma Coles
Facebook page with my power of makeup
video like the photo like the half-half
promoting this perfect timing derma Col
please explain to me how I could have
used that foundation for my power of
makeup when today is the first time
actually trying it out are you
advertising fake news
are you lying whatever you like but like
you lie no no derma Col you never asked
me to use that picture I never try it
your foundation before so what you're
doing is lying to your following that's
not okay so you've had a surprise my ass
or you're gonna get it all in good fun
of course but I do think it's a little
weird / shady that they would use a
picture of me without asking and without
me even wearing the product to promote
their product that's not okay with me
and yeah I just wanted to get that out
there so when you open the foundation up
it actually comes it comes with
instructions all right you ready Mila
Deutsch name post schedule what polish
people say no one say no no no English
yes clinically tested hypoallergenic
high covered derma call makeup cover is
one of the first cover up makeup
products release on the world market
okay its formula was developed in
errand off film studios in Prague for
professional makeup artists and
subsequent subsequently sold in
Hollywood it was only sold in Hollywood
it's unique creamy consistency
containing 50% pigments heights I know
babe
Heights an even skin color and blemishes
smooth ins out the skin and gives it a
velvety matte appearance and down it can
be used on the entire face and body for
color correction lightening or darkening
skin tones or for professional makeup
applications such as photography
modeling and special occasions well I
might so have a special occasion today
and I'm gonna bring you with me I'm
gonna it's gonna be one of the first
times I'm actually gonna like vlog I'm
shooting for a Dutch webseries today and
it's gonna be a long-ass day so I need
to see how long this lasts and when it
starts looking bad and everything so I'm
just gonna take you with me so you'll be
joining me today derma coal makeup cover
is water-resistant and has been journal
ah Jack Lee tested it is suitable for
all skin types you know what I think
it's enough of the talking I think we
should get down to the business and
actually try it out I ordered two
colours the colours I ordered are 207
and 208 this is what the packaging looks
like it is gold
you don't like gold
I believe these retail for $12 on Amazon
but I had to order these from a Dutch
webshop because Amazon hates me and it
doesn't want to trip to my house see it
would that any further adieu I think
that was the longest intro of my life so
let's get down to the coverage alrighty
so this is what my face looks like
straight out of the shower I put a tiny
bit of moisturizer on because I cannot
live without moisturizer with my dry a
skin and that brings me to the following
subject I have dried to combination skin
so meaning my skin is very dry very dry
but somehow my t-zone is oily so
throughout the day when there's
foundation on top it will break apart
throughout the day like after like 6 to
7 hours maybe even 5 I see like product
becoming shiny and breaking apart on my
nose so we don't want that and that's
why we're testing this out
it comes with a little opener like that
so you got a kind of like forced your
way in so see how like just like
medicine it's like closed off so you got
it I am going to be applying primer I
want to treat this foundation like I
treat all my other foundations when I am
wearing foundation I'm wearing primer
I'm wearing a shitload of powder and I'm
baking because this will ensure for me
that it'll stay on as long as possible
so I'm gonna treat this foundation like
no other so the primer I'll be using
today is jae-won jelly pack this is
amazing it's like a makeup glue this is
so sticky that anything you put over top
is really gonna last so just apply that
and proud baby and once you're done
priming let's go down to the foundation
I'm gonna be applying it using my morphe
Beauty Blender sponge
I put color 208 on the back of my hand
I'm gonna dip my sponge into it and here
we go oh wow
oh she thick what Oh
oh my god oh my god I
I'm so amazed I don't know what to say I
dipped my sponge in taking quite a lot
of thinking I'll probably need more than
I think that dip pretty much covered
like half of my face already this is
insane when I'm looking at the
consistency and how it feels on my face
she's thick this foundation is
definitely on the thicker side but it's
not uncomfortably thick you know how you
have foundations that when you put them
on they just feel like a mask this is
like a comfortable thick like you feel
it covering you up but it's nothing like
oh my god oh my god it feels a little
bit waxy almost almost like a little mu
C but the coverage just keeps going and
going and go I haven't dipped back in
this is absolutely insane I think the
color is a little tiny bit too pill for
me which i think is amazing because I am
white s paper so anyone lighter than
paper which is pretty much like
see-through paper um you got a match
this is 208 I know they have 207 but
swatches online showed me that 207
actually looked darker than 208 but I'm
just amazed at all of this right now
it's covering up everything this can
cover up family members that I don't
like
oh my god and just like that my face is
removed you actually Mila scratched me
and it's like a little scab right now so
I cannot remove it it's just gab it's
not it's not it's not what you think it
is I went from a red flustered mess to a
blank canvas it doesn't get more like
even than this it's oh my god I don't
know what to say if this lasts long I
might have found my Holy Grail Holy
Grail Holy Grail full coverage
foundation because this covered up
everything I mean I can cover up haters
with this I'm gonna be like Shh you're
gone
weirdly enough I also feel like it is
hiding my pores
it's a veil like a cover it's like
beautiful
whoa and then now I'm gonna bake my
under-eye area to make sure it does
increase throughout the day and I'm
gonna be quite honest with you this is
my biggest fear because this consistency
is a little bit more waxy I do have a
little feeling that it's gonna move and
like break apart throughout the day but
only time can tell it's a let's see
all right under eyes are set and now I'm
gonna set the rest of my face using some
loose powder and a powder puff and
really press it in it's also one toned I
love it I love it I feel like a blank
canvas I want to paint my face I want to
go the extra mile even though I can't
because I have that show today so I
can't go all out but like I am loving
this I'm not gonna do my brows and eyes
off-camera and maybe I'll come back when
I'm about to do my cheeks to bring back
all the dimension but so far really good
really good it really impressed so this
is what my face looks like after the
whole shebang I am in love so far so
this is the end result doing my makeup
using the derma coal foundation as a
base and I will say the following things
if you're a light coverage kind of
person this will be extreme for you the
first time applying it not me personally
you know I love my full coverage so I am
used to it I am used to a thicker layer
a more intense layer to kickin it up on
my face I'm making it look flawless if
that's not you the first time putting
this on you're gonna be shocked coverage
wise I think it looks fabulous
and even after doing all my bronzing
contouring blush highlight I think the
color is a really really good match it's
a little bit more pale and neutral I'm a
little bit more yellow and just to
teensiest bit warmer but I think the
color match is pretty damn awesome other
than that it completely got rid of any
pores it just it's like a beautiful
blank canvas veil and I am obsessed so
I'm praying that this will look good
throughout the day I am now about to get
picked up for my ride to Amsterdam and
then I'm gonna have a full day of
shooting for that Dutch web series and
I'll do check-ins and I'll show you what
it looks like and I'll see you in a
little bit so I'm now
set well almost sunset I just got my
hair done it changed my life I'm wearing
pajamas cuz I'm gonna be filming in bed
with Fred fred is my friend and we're
gonna do a really really fun episode but
here is the foundation after almost
three hours
I haven't powdered anything I just
changed my lip up and that's about it so
no powder no nothing it's not creasing
in my nose it's not creasing anywhere
I'm not shiny well it's a good shiny
highlighter - I'm good
300 marks so we just shop the show my
foundation still looks really good
no powder what time is it 7:00 just got
done shooting and so it's been on for
about five hours now and this is the
time after all that laughing I did kind
of see that crease
it's creasing in my smile nice and a
little bit this is so real right here
it's starting to break down a little bit
it's not necessarily shiny or anything
it still looks good but it is breaking
apart right here and right there
and that's usually where it breaks apart
for me so I'm a little disappointed that
it didn't last longer than other
foundations but just gonna go in with my
first powder of the day kind of toning
I'm thinking that it's really good still
five hours let's see how it holds up
alright so it is almost midnight and
that means I've been wearing this
foundation for pretty much like nine and
a half hours now and I want to take my
makeup off it's been a long day and I'm
done but my final verdict on the derma
coal foundation world's most full
coverage foundation it's really not that
long-lasting I can have long ass like 12
to 13 hour days with my Lancome
foundation and my Estee Lauder
foundation and it will look flawless
till the end until I take it off this
however I see breaking apart on my chin
it is creasing in my smile lines it is
creasing in this little little nook
including of my nose and overall it's
just starting to look worn and it's just
starting to look old and cakey so
definitely after the 7 hour mark is when
I started noticing that it started
looking a little bit more cakey a little
bit more dry it started breaking up and
placed this especially my chin and my
nose are having the hardest time right
now holding up so am I going to use this
foundation in the future solely by
itself
maybe for filming maybe when I'm doing
that tutorial and I want even more
coverage than usual but what I mainly
think this is gonna be my holy grail for
is making any foundation in my
collection more covering so let's say I
have a foundation that I love the
consistency and texture and everything
up like the longevity but I just want a
tiny teensy bit more coverage I feel
like for the future I'll definitely add
a tiny drop of this to give it that
extra mile I will say though under my
eyes it looks flawless so what the
baking it looks beautiful so I'm even
thinking maybe I'm gonna start using
this as concealer because my under eyes
really look really really good so for
the future I think this is gonna be a
mixing medium for other foundations and
a concealer for me but just by itself
purely itself no and that pretty much
