wave cleft ever hey guys so today I'm
doing a little playtime sort of tutorial
first impression slash review all the
new magic Khalid bhai dubious claims as
you know devious place is my favorite
eyeshadow brand they create pure and
utter magic it's like it came out of a
unicorns ass it is so insanely good and
it's so affordable and today they came
out with the magic palette and looked
like I taught about you but at and
diarrhea every single time when Juvia
space comes out with new palettes I am
so fascinated by all the color combos
because I would have never thought to
put all these colors together but
somehow they work so did I'm going to
take this palette out for a spin I want
to try it out see what I can do with it
you can already see what it did with it
spoiler alert
and basically just sit down and have fun
with it and see what the colors do see
what the pigmentation is like and yeah
so without any further ado if you would
like to know what this palette can do
but keep on watching the first color are
we going in with is nunna
and picking this color up on a ramus
number 9 brush and defining my crease
with this and we're going to go from
inner to outer corner and once you reach
that outer corner you also want to swoop
it out and that's time for my favorite
blending technique taking a clean brush
and just wiggling at the edges to make
it nice and smooth and this color is so
loaded with a color pigment I felt a
little scared if I was ever going to be
able to blend it out but with this
technique it just blurs like magic going
back in with Nana Andry intensifying the
colors in the crease and of course blend
the edges again
now with max select cover-up concealer
in nw15 I'm going to be cutting the lid
and creating basically an entire new eye
shape and a little trick for it if you
have hooded eyelids like I do go a
little bit above your natural crease so
that when you look forward it still
peeks through a little bit and you have
a way larger looking eye
and now setting that with one of my
favorite colors of the palette
Osen
now with an angled eyeliner brush these
away about 3:15 I'm going in with Nana
again and really christening up that
line of the new crease for my weight
today I'm going to go in with the urban
decay razor-sharp lenger in gold rush
and going right over top with another
favorite color of the pallid Nubia
time to focus on that lower lashline I'm
going to work as akia
and Nana on my lower lash line and
leaving a little gap open on the inner
corner to open up my eyes even more I'm
sorry but this payment is so rude it is
so disrespectful
it is so pigmented you only need to then
like I said we're going to leave a
little spot open to put liquid liner and
later on white to open up the eye and in
yesterday's video I talked about my
issues with the NYX white liquid liner
and everybody recommended this Urban
Decay one it's another razor-sharp liner
and this is in the color bump and
apparently this doesn't crack so thank
you at putting this on that little gap
and once you put the white on there it
will really open up the eyes and so seal
the deal on these bellow lashes I knew
bounce them ever since yesterday I have
fallen in love with them again I really
like what they did in the Wonder Woman
look so here we go
alright time for the cheeks I first
going to bronze up this is a standard
step nothing new air this also nothing
new here for a little bit of contour
today I'm going to go into the naked
skin shapeshifter palette by urban decay
when you open it on this side it's got
powders and then once you flip the
mirror over you got cream
I already powdered my face oh no creams
here so we're going to go back go back
to the powder powder and I'm going to
grab this color right here to do a
little bit of contour just tiny bit
nothing too much okay that's brown oh
God subtle isn't isola okay so that is a
serious shade of brown let's tone that
down a little bit for blush I'm going to
go in with a teensy bit of x-rated blush
by Kylie cosmetics for highlights today
I'm going to go in with this BH
spotlight highlight palette this is so
good this is affordable blinding and
everything and today I'll be using these
two colors right here oh I don't know if
it's because it's as fresh but ever
since I've been using this brush for a
highlighter everything has been so
intense and so good so I don't know if
it's the brush well the product is
amazing but like because of the brush it
goes on so smoothly and so we're
selectively I mean you can do your
makeup in the reflection of my cheek
for lists today I want to go in with
this new Maybelline product this is a
liquid lipstick that stays on look no
look nobody's business this is the
maybelline superstay matte ink and this
is in the color oh five Royalists I saw
this on Karen's channel I loved study
and the swatches did not lie or she
could barely remove these from her lips
in her arms and that's what I know I
will really like something so let's
apply this to the lips
my guard collapses quick little play
time using the new juvie s place palette
the magic palette I love your so much I
absolutely adore this baby right here
and I think the possibilities with this
one are LS you got your warm tone colors
you got your cool tone colors this color
right here
I think this palette is a must-have like
any other dubious place palettes they're
affordable I still don't know how they
do it such an incredible formula for
such an amazingly low price it it's
Ludlow glue
all right so for a fulness of everything
product mentioned and used throughout
