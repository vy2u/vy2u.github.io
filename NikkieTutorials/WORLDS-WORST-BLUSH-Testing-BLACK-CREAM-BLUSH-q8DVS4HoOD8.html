days ago I was doing some online
shopping and of course when I go online
shopping I go ham I buy all of the
makeup i buy stuff let's make as I'm
scrolling I'm like look at this stuff I
need more in my collection
please so I stumbled upon the Givenchy
noir
revelatory or blush wait let me actually
try this I stumbled upon this cream
blush right here it is by Givenchy
Givenchy Givenchy Java gagaga Noir
driven a dude said that so alright so in
English this blush is called revealing
black blush and in friendship pronounce
it as alright so today I'm gonna be
trying out this blush and this blush is
a cream black blush meaning yes when you
squeeze this out you get a black blush
and then the magic behind it is that you
work it in and then a new color arises
to the surface so I thought that was so
cool for today's video so I'm gonna zoom
you guys a little bit closer into my
face and we're gonna be starting off
with foundation to get a nice base going
and then we're gonna be applying this on
a wet base and on a dry base so let's go
ahead assume you guys in and let's get
ready alright so before we do anything
some necessary primer this is amazing
cosmetics illuminate primer highlighter
in glow
all righty so that is applied and worked
into wolf Jim and I love how it has like
a really nice cooling effect to the skin
also so let's move on to foundation I'm
gonna go ahead and apply my usual layer
of full coverage foundation right now I
want my skin to be flawless I go worse
means I am I love it
for concealer my favorite NARS soft
matte complete concealer in number one
light one
all right and now let's work that under
I in and then we're gonna bake right
after but don't drag your bake too low
down because this is a cream blush so
you want to have that witness of the
skin to blended improperly well on one
side of the face because we will be
trying it on a dry face to later on
all righty so that is the base worked in
and then baked with the under eyes and
now let's actually play with the
revealing black blush eye as you Vaughn
she and okay so this is what the tube
looks like it's a pretty big tube like
if you loved this product this will last
you for a bit so I'm gonna be trying up
the west side on this side and the dry
side later on on this side so what I'm
going to be doing is I'm just gonna be
placing a couple of dots on my cheeks
and then I'm gonna try and work it in
with a brush I'm nervous I haven't seen
anyone use this yet so this might go
horribly wrong this part of may be
horrible it might not even show up let's
see how this goes okay in a 1 cert
brushing it looks great to me brushing
it in that's doing nothing oh my god
that is erasing my foundation that is
amazing what is this what I'm planet
earth am i doing okay so as you can see
it added a really tiny tint of pink but
it's mostly very shadowy and grey and it
erased all my foundation like all my
foundation is gone okay we can do this
we can know this a little bit more and
then fingers let's do fingers fingers
fingers fingers fingers please
oh that is not blush that's my
actual skin color we are witnessing my
skin colour coming through my foundation
again it's surprisingly really really
oily so I feel like the oilier the cream
blush is the more it's gonna mess up
your base underneath and it's that is
exactly what's happening here it's
technically called the made-to-measure
pink blush and online it says that it is
a black blush with a ultra soft powder
gel formula
I read oils that reacts to the pH and
levels of your skin so I guess the
higher your pH levels the pinkier the
blush is and the lower the softer and to
apply it it says to just directly apply
to the cheek and then blend it with
fingers or a brush and it has dried in
now and I feel like now that it is dry
it's a little bit more pink but and my
foundation is moving again
it's literally removing all my base
products do you see that beautiful soft
line of gradiation into the beautifully
applied people why do I feel like that
cheek is getting pink here and pink here
whoa there we are beautiful I have a
slight feeling that we can all agree
that this does not look flattering on me
isn't hold on babe can we have a methyl
zoom oh yeah baby oh yeah oh boy
mm I've never looked better I love how
the tone of pink matches my skin so
perfectly hmm all right so um here we
are I feel like this is oh my god it
looks so bad so Rick just came in and he
was like are you sure that is how you
use the product I was like babe I
followed the instructions that's how you
do it this is what it's supposed to be
it's so horrible so the Givenchy blush
noir leveler to can go and eat baguettes
thank you I have never in a long I
haven't I haven't played with a product
that let me down so badly in so long
this looks so bad and I tried to blend
in the edges into my foundation but it
created it just showed of my bare skin
please' made it super super pink and
like I have like these edges here that
you cannot get rid of anymore I don't
know who on their team was that guys
guys guys oh let's get all together guys
I have found our treasure I have found
the product that will make us go boom
team I was a little drunk this weekend
but I think I figured it out we're gonna
make a cream blush we're gonna make it
black and then we're gonna slap some
sexy French words on it and we got
ourselves the products of the year team
