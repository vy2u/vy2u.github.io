a party really fun but before I go to
this ting I have to rent about this uh
product um yesterday I did this haul
from cosmetics home so calm and it got
lots and lots of great feedback and um
it got lots of great responses and um in
that hall I showed you a two-faced a lip
injection yesterday I I I was here
because this is where I am my entire
life already um I was like oh I need to
do my gloves and I need to do my lips
and I was like oh let's write a lip
injection because the color is really
pretty and I put on my concealer for my
new lips and I put on that benefit
cupids bow sac and then I took this and
I put it on my lips I was like wow
that's pretty yeah it's pretty well
pretty and then this happened how I did
not know that this was a lip plumper I
love lip plumpers I love my Mac
bountiful plush class I love my I don't
know what it is but huh lip plumpers
plump your lips with a teeny
tiny tingle this makes you feel like a
Thousand Needles attack your lips like
and it hurt like hell basically and when
I did was that just my hand and I did
this you know like get it off my lips
and it still hurt like hell and what I
didn't notice was that an hour late
later my entire hand was swollen and red
at the places where the glove has been
and I took some pictures for you to
prove it

fetish for needles in your lips plus
swollen lips then get it if not</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
