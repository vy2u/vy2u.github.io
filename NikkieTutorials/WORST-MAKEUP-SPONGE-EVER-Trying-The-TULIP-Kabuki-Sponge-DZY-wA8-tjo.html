now I can't look at myself right now I
never do my eyes before foundation and I
look like a creep hey guys so today I am
here to do a first impressions on a
sponge that I ran into and it has it has
possessed my brains and I don't even
know what to do with it I have to get it
out of my system I have to do a first
impressions video on it today I am
talking about the Ricky's a tulip kabuki
sponge yes Rick and I were in New York
last week and we went to Ricky's and I
saw this and I was like what the fuck it
looks really weird
it doesn't resemble a tulip not even one
bit I'm from Holland
I could no it doesn't look like a total
but you know it seems like every other
week we have a new trend we just dealt
with the scylla sponge and now we're on
to the Ricky tulip kabuki sponge um my
first honest and real thought with you
is that I feel like this is not gonna do
shit for my face basically I think this
is gonna suck hard so the tongue kabuki
sponge retails for ten dollars actually
comes out of the black holder so you
have the Ricky's holder here and then
the sponge like this now first thoughts
it feels very plasticy and rough now
usually I don't say no to something
plastic enough but I don't feel like
that would be the greatest combo for
foundation but who am I to judge I'm
gonna try it right here right now I
cannot wait to try this out and if all
else fails I still look like a creep all
right you McDonald's fries looking thing
I'm ready for you so I'm gonna go in
with my favorite foundation don't even
have to talk about this right now but
I'm gonna go in with that and here I
have the tulip blender and what I'm
gonna do is just I don't know what I'm
doing all right I'm just gonna pick the
foundation up by the tips okay with that
and then let's see
okay okay mm-hmm
all right so if I tap the product in it
leaves the imprint of the tulip on my
face just okay I don't know what Ricky's
is trying to tell me I never wanted to
look like a window shade but you know
what if we swipe it in alright so what
I'm noticing is that it's completely
shearing out my foundation it is hard to
it feels like you're bouncing a cheap
kit toy onto your cheeks how do you need
your eyes without it messing up
everything okay maybe if I go both ways
and then why are these indents here what
what's the purpose of these small little
little crevices what do the crevices do
the only thing that's doing what I
expected it to do is apply my foundation
it's not applying it beautifully it's
not blending it in nicely
it's just applying it to my skin and
that's all I hate you Rikki's you're
gonna have to explain yourself in a
public statement cuz US beauty lovers
don't deserve this I just can't even
reach one little corner without this
sponge grabbing the foundation putting
it in its backpack and running out of
the street all right I worked really
hard on these eyes I'm not gonna give up
on this look I'm gonna use the flat
circle I'm gonna use the bottom I'm
gonna use its ass just save this look
because I worked hard for this look I'm
not giving enough Nick Oh still nothing
still feels like a very harsh kids toy
that's cheap you got it off of a flea
market it's cheap back yard sale this
ass portion is the only thing saving my
look right now so I'm not even going to
complain all right it has literally
taken me 20 minutes to do just
foundation
let's um oh god I just want to quit here
and run just run for my life
I am going to do concealer with this
what are you doing know what don't eat
up the concealer you bitch like it is
taking up right here so much it is
looking so patchy so disturbing hey you
I am gonna try and fix this with my
beloved Beauty Blender off camera
alright so I ended up having to do half
of my foundation again using a regular
Beauty Blender cuz it was a patchy ass
uneven mess so I do want to go over the
claims mm-hmm get ready for this the
Ricky's tulip kabuki sponge is the best
of both worlds
part sponge and part brush the tulip
shape makes even application of liquid
and cream cosmetics easier than ever
why you gotta lie so much for Oh tip put
a small amount of liquid to powder or
cream foundation on the back of hand
brush up down left and right quickly and
finish by patting skin with the sponge
is it honey
we tried patting I ended up looking like
a zebra sponge removes from handle for
easy washing rinse well with cleanser
and let air dry bitch I'll let you air
dry outside this shouldn't come as a
surprise but I really flippin hate this
so bad hood if there's anyone out there
who wants to try this and make it work
by all means be my guest
please prove me wrong cuz that was
really bad anyways on to more positive
thoughts that is the end of day three of
winter wonder we if you liked watching
