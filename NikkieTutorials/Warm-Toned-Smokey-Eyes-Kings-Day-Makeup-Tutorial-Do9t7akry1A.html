as always today I'm doing the tutorial
on this warm toned smokey eye look I was
super inspired because next Monday here
in Holland it is Kings Day
therefore the orange background this is
sort of an homage to my duchies I've
done a couple of kings and queens day
tutorials in the past before but this
year I wanted to make it super wearable
and sexy and smoky and appropriate for
mine undead she's also because I want
everyone to be able to do warm toned
smokey eyes staff without any further
ado if you want to know how to get these
warm toned smokey eyes perfect for kings
day as well then please keep on watching
so the first thing I'm doing is always
is applying a base to my eyelids to
prevent everything from creasing and for
this I'll be using my Mac soft ochre
Paint Pot the first eyeshadow I'll be
using today is Coco bear by makeup geek
and I'm just starting off by softly
placing this into my crease kind of push
it in there and wiggle around and then
once it's on start blending and
diffusing that out
now I'm taking makeup geeks at Peach
Smoothie and I'm mixing this in with
cocoa bear and with that mixture you're
dragging the crease more towards the
inner part of your crease so this is
outer part this is inner part so with a
softer shade of warm brown or going on
the inside of the crease now with Peach
Smoothie only I'm going to soften the
edges just lightly now I'm taking the
unassessably Hills artist palette and
taking this color right here Orange you
fancy and that color is going on to the
inner third of my eyelid
then I'm also placing this right here of
sort of the outer third of my lid for
the center I'll be using this makeup
geek fold eyeshadow in in the spotlight
and blend it with the orange for the
lower lash line we're basically
mimicking what we did on top so I'm
first going in with Coco bear by makeup
geek and applying this to my outer
corners then also applying cocoa bear on
the inner corners and putting in the
spotlight right in the center and with
orange you fancy I'm going right in
between the two for my eyeliner today
I'm using uh necessity briefly Hill's a
liquid lipstick in vamp and the liquid
lipsticks by on the suburb Lee Hills
actually make the best liquid eyeliners
and I personally won't be doing a wing
for this look but if you feel like doing
the wing then do it to bring back a
little bit of that orange element and
taking another liquid lipstick by
unassessed Beverly Hills
this is persimmon and a mixing it with
vamp and that together will create a
really warm warm Brown and that is going
right on the center of the eyeliner to
open up my eyes I'm using a little bit
of nyx milk i pencil during this
off-camera and all you want to do now to
finish is apply mascara and falsies and
falsies i'll be using are these by house
of lashes these are called the temptress
lashes for cheeks i'm going to highlight
using my Kat Von D shade and light
palette
to bronze my skin I'm using this alluri
L glam runs in number one for blush of
using Mac's peaches
then to highlight I'm first going in
with the Becca shimmering skin perfecter
in rose gold in a bigger brush and this
is going to act as a glow all over and
then with moonstone later on and really
going to intensify everything so taking
a little bit of rose gold and popping
that on the tops of my cheeks nose just
everywhere really and as I said with
moonstone only I'm really going to
highlight
and that's say for the cheeks for lips I
want to go for a nude and matte
so the first liquid lipstick I'll be
using is my honest as de Rivoli Hills
this is called pure Hollywood
and then on the center I'll be applying
milkshake
and that guy's concludes my warm tone
smokey eye makeup tutorial which fits
perfectly for Kings day here in Holland
