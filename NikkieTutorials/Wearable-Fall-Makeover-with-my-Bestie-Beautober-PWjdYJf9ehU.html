video because I'm gonna do a make over
slash tutorial on my best friend
lisanna she's been my best friend for
about six seven years now and I love her
to death
lisanna was feeling a little bit down
because she was having a cold so I
decided to pamper her a bit and just
give her a mini makeover so without any
further ado let's just get right to it
one of the most important things when it
comes to makeovers is brows brows frame
the face brows do everything with a face
so least honest eyebrows hadn't been
touched for like months so I took my
tweezers and I just tweezed until there
was no tomorrow and I just made her
brows into a nice shape and that's step
number one
next it was time for the cleanup and I
just decided to clean your face with a
wet wipe and then moisturize the crap
out of her face because her face was
somewhat more dry I decided to hardcore
moisturize it with one of my Dermalogica
moisturizers okay once that moisturizer
settled in a bit it's time for
foundation the foundation is amusing rmx
face and body c1 and Revlon's Colorstay
foundation in number 150 and I'm
applying this all with a damp Beauty
Blender and I just keep on stippling
foundation on until it looks flawless
and of course for concealer my trusty
old OCC skin concealer
with my beauty blender and that's just
going to go all over the skin and make
it even more perfect and to set it all
in place I'm just going to use a powder
of course because the sauna was having a
cold her entire complexion was a little
bit grayish in the Libet down I decided
to first contour her face a bit with my
NYX blush in taupe then I warmed up her
face with my Lancome star bronzer number
three as a blush I used my NARS blush in
Jena and this looked stunning on her
and then to give her an amazing glow I
use my Mac mineralize skinfinish in soft
and gentle and she looks gorgeous with
it all
photographs I decided to keep it really
natural and just to find them a little
bit more to fill them in I use my
Anastasia brow powder duo in ash blonde
and hope
and I set the hairs in place with my Mac
brow gel and sophisticated
as always the first thing you want to do
with eyes is a pie base to prevent the
eyeshadow from creasing and the one I
used with my soft ochre Paint Pot by Mac
then I started to define decreased a
little bit more using max eyeshadows in
texture and kid
I also run that along her lower lash
line and then connected it at the outer
corners
then I went ahead and took kid only and
I started blending that entire crease
out and make it look really wearable and
smokey for the lid I use my Holy Grail
Mac pressed pigment in the spot lit it
looks insanely stunning I love this
for an inner corner highlight I use my
nurse eyes shadow duo in Alhambra
on my waterline i used my next slide on
pencil in brown perfection and to finish
it all off i curled leaves on the
slashes and then on top applied some
phenomenal lashes mascara by number
seven and just just yeah mascara and
make it look sexy and that it's your
eyes completed and i still feel like a
radio person when I do these voiceovers
I feel like
welcome to kiss FM and for lips I
decided to keep it really nude and
natural and I used the ultimate color
number ten be natural lipstick by
Catrice if it's a turkey yeah this with
me end up time so you guys take it guys
