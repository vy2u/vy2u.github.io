this makeup look right here I wanted to
create a more soft but very very glowy
glam summer makeup tutorial summer is
right around the corner in Holland right
now it's blazing hot so that inspired me
to come up with a look that is softer
and wearable but still has a couple of
fun twists basically I just had so much
fun with this because usually when
people ask me to do something more
wearable or natural I go yeah really why
but today I actually came up with a more
wearable look for summer that has a
couple of twists and turns but still
very interesting and fun to learn so
yeah if you would like to know how to
get this glowy luminous a summer makeup
look then keep on watching alright first
thing we're gonna do is hydrate and
moisturize this dry-ass face I'm gonna
go in with my Kiehl's ultra facial
moisturizer and after a spray douse soak
myself with Mario Badescu rose water
spray Presley know those people that can
really attractively put moisturizer on
their faces yeah
I'm not one of them alright just let
your skin soak that up and then we're
ready for a foundation for foundation
today I'm gonna go in with the Tarte
rainforest of the sea water-based
foundation and I like this one
especially because this one gives great
coverage but it still looks like like
genuine authentic skin and then in areas
where I want to be a little bit more
secure and have a little bit more
coverage I'm gonna apply my Ultra HD
foundation stick by Make Up For Ever in
117 so this makes sure right here is
gonna give me luminous summer skin so
I'm applying the stick right here on my
cheeks cuz they get a little bit red
also on my chin
Center forehead and nose and then the
chart I'm going to mix in between just
with my Beauty Blender I'm gonna dot it
around and then now let's buff it all in
so see how it absolutely covers
everything this way but it's still a
very thin layer because it's water-based
so you get the best parts of everything
you get full coverage but you still have
skin for concealer I'm going to do a
little bit of mixing again I'm going to
apply the by-by under I buy it cosmetics
underneath my eyes and to highlight and
bring back features than my face I'm
going to take the rainforest of the sea
concealer and this is in the color fair
and again you know it
I want to set my under eyes using dinars
loose powder in snow
of course you want this look to last all
day along in a hot summer day so I'm
going to wear the Mac soft ochre Paint
Pot to keep my makeup on all day long
and for this I'm using a sigma 3d HD
precision brush taking the morphe 35o
i'll matte palette and taking the
lightest color from that and setting my
brow bone and crease with this and make
sure you really get those inner corners
here as well to really get that fresh
gorgeous feel but leave this right here
below the arch of your brow free because
we're going to apply shimmer there for
the brow bone highlight I'm going to
take the morphe 35o all shimmer palette
and taking the lightest color from that
and using a luck C 211 brush for this
for the crease I'm hopping back over to
the 3500 M palette and taking these
colors right here and for this I'll be
using a more feet M 504 brush
all right going back to the 35 OS pellet
and taking this gorgeous peachy shimmery
color goddess II color right here and
using a Mac 242 just applying this all
over the lid
to glow up the inner corners I'm going
to take this in watt pigment in number
75 and with a damp luck C 217 brush I'm
just going to glow up the inner corners
for the lower lash line I'm going to
take this color right here from the
morphe 35o I'll matte palette and with a
Cosette D 230 brush I first going to lay
down a base and then once you reach the
center I'm going to go in with an angled
brush and create a new inner corner and
then in that space in between I'm going
to apply that same Inglot pigment
alright all you want to do now to finish
is apply some lashes and these are by
glossy makeup and these are called
Chelsea
now on this hot summer day we might lose
a pound of sweat but we still want to
exaggerate that we want to look sculpted
and am like ready to do you know it just
I just want to look sculpted so I'm
gonna go in with the Kevyn Aucoin to
medium sculpting powder and my favorite
contouring brush the morphe M 530 and
I'm gonna contour with that if you're
not a contour lover by all means skip
this keep it fresh but mama's got a
sculpt and then hopping over to my 140
brush by zueva
and it's kind of bit of that contouring
powder as well and really like really
exaggerating the hollowness hollowness
and then with your face powder
underneath you can clean it up make it
look even more I'm also going to do a
little bit of bronzing I'm going to go
in with the coverfx bronzer and
sunkissed and my Cosette number one
brush and I'm going to just this lightly
around the hairline lightly also a
little bit over that contour almost kind
of as a blush a little bit on the chin
and on the nose
for blush I'm going to use this Mac
blush in what I fancy and my new
favorite blush brush I know the Cosette
number 2 brush is amazing for blush but
I feel like it almost kind of lifts the
foundation and powder and kind of leaves
holes in your base and this brush this
one buy more feet this is the M 509
brush this just glides blush on like a
dream so this is happening this brush is
just so feather soft it just glides the
blush on without disturbing the base I
love it all right time to glow and I
wanted this look to be all about the
glows so we have really flirty eyes
beautiful skin but I want a glow I want
this glow to be like when you're on the
beach and you're wearing this glow I
want people to think that your glow is
the Sun your glow is stronger than the
Sun and in order to do that I have a
trick we're going to spray our face with
a setting spray and by the time it's
almost dry but still a little bit damp
that's when you want to apply your
highlighter it's the same as with eye
shadow when you use a damp brush it will
go on so much more intense same goes for
highlighter so if you use so we're going
to spray our face and then wait for it
to be almost dry the perfect amount of
dampness and then we apply our
highlighter and is really going to and
for this I'm going to use the moon stone
by Becca and the setting spray I'll be
using is by urban decay and this is the
all nighter and give it a shake so we're
going to do one half one half
all right almost dry fam can we take a
seat can we take a seat not only will
that make your glow last longer it will
do this which is amazing
almost mother of holy highlighters I'm
sorry if you're watching this video with
your parents in the room they'll
probably think you're watching porn oh
okay
tip of the nose let's not forget and we
don't need a damn face for this because
the highlight on the nose is strong
enough as it is
and of course Cupid's bow alright time
for lips all right now for this look I
feel like you can go with ever you want
for lips you can go bright dark nude
matte glossy whatever is in between you
can do whatever you want now I
personally feel like this look is so
much about the skin and about this
flirty eyes I want to apply nude glossy
lips just to keep it very sexual and
summer-ish and just that
so I'm lightly going to outline my lips
using the colour-pop lippie pencil in
BFF
and then with that tiny brush I'm
actually going to defuse the center of
the lip liner see what a lovely like
pout that gives by diffusing the center
here by diffusing it just a little bit
up it really gives you that JLo like
without the okay for loops on first
going in with Mel Cosmetics text just to
kind of fill everything in over that lip
liner alright and you a little bit more
warmth in this lip so I'm gonna go in
with kinda sexy by Mac just tapping over
top and then finally as a gloss going to
use this cream machine glass by Mac and
this is in the color fashion scoop
and that guy's concludes a sexy summer
glam ultimate glam glowy luminous makeup
