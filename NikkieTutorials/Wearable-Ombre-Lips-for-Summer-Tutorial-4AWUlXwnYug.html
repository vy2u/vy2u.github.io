tutorial on um bring lips we've had um
red nails we've had ombre hair and ever
going to do on real lips it's like
playing with the eye because you see so
many colors I absolutely love it if you
want to know how to get this red hot
pink orange ombre lips then please keep
on watching so the first thing I'm going
to do is blank out your lips completely
with either a foundation or a lip erase
product I'm going to use the lip erase
stuff to completely get rid of your
natural lip color
now I'm personally going to start off
with lip pencils to kind of map out
where I want the ombre to go to you so
at the top I'm going to start with a
darker red then I'm going to go to a
pink and then I'm going to go to a
orange and then it's sort of my ombre
colors for today so this are sort of the
colors that I will be using today first
just start by penciling everything in
then with the pencil itself I'm just
going to feather it down now I'm going
to take the neon pink and fill the rest
of my top lip in and while I'm filling
that in I'm kind of blending it with a
red pencil as well so already get that
gradient ombre effect going so with the
neon orange I'm just going to lie my
bottom lip and then blend it upward
then take your neon pink again and fill
in that little gap that is still left
okay so you can definitely leave it
matte like this and just touch it with
some concealer to make the lines perfect
and crispy clean but if you want to make
this even more loud and crazy and
beautiful just take some lipsticks that
are a little bit more bright than the
lip pencils and go on top and blend it
even more and you will get an amazing
ombre effect
and that is how you can get the most fun
ombre lips in the world
so yeah fashionistas that completes this
tutorial for this month I hope you
enjoyed for any questions leave them in
a comment section below and hopefully I
will see you guys next month bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
