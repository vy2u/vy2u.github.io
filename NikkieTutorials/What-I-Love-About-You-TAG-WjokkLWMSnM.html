about you tag I have seen like everyone
do it and I got requests to do it like
no other
so today I'm here to do the what I love
about you tag okay question number one
who would you trade hair with on YouTube
that would be Julie gee except I won a
bleach blonde version of it I've met
great IMS she is like the sweetest
person ever question number two who is
someone whose videos are a first watch
well hands down that are the Pixlr
sisters I am obsessed with them I can't
like literally I can watch their videos
an entire day long and get not sick of
it like their accent their skills their
humor their off their with their
prettiness their like every sink where's
number three who has amazing style to
you that would be Dulce candy just uh
Dulce some what if she's like this eenie
meenie patina puberty worry I love her
she is so cute she is she also has
beautiful hair but her style she has a
blog and she always posts like I put up
today's and stuff and I'm obsessed with
it I love her number four a favorite
guru who lives in a different country
than you
that would be like anyone because I live
in them no one's um that would be that
will be the pixie was sisters again I
think there are my favorite
so yeah the pixie was sisters again
there was someone you feel you can rely
on that would be hands down
jean-francois CD he is my big brother my
my internet big brother hello Jean
Francois CD he is so sweet he is so nice
I can talk with him about like anything
he lives in Canada and hopefully I will
visit him like in
wind her like all somewhat right there
I love jf he is what he's probably my
best mate on the air so I can tell him
everything
who do you think has great confidence
that would be Carly Chrisman she is
gorgeous she is like hands down she's
like me the only thing is she is skinny
and she's tall and she has longer hair
she is amazing she made a video about
being confident being tall and letting
go or something and that video is like
amazeballs it will drop your lipstick on
the ground if you could be best friends
with someone on YouTube who would it be
that would be restaurants - I've been
talking to her on Twitter like back and
forth and she is hilarious I can laugh
my ass off because of her she's so
pretty she has her channel response too
and she is so funny and I told people on
Twitter like if if we lift closer to
each other I swear to God Lord
hallelujah that we would be best friends
who has the cutest username the cutest
username the cutest username I can't
really come up with it but probably
pixie woo I mean it sounds cute pixie
moon like pixie woo who is the most
down-to-earth that would be karlie
Chrisman again she is I told you she is
confidence 101 she is down-to-earth and
you will not get her like off the ground
who would you love to go shopping with
then we'll be rich roast - I told you
like if we you live closer to each other
we will be best friends Oh shopping with
her would be disastrous because we we
would only laugh our asses off who's
someone you have watched from the
beginning that is makeup geek TV um it's
just makeup geek TV right it's makeup
geek Marlena she is my YouTube mentor
for some of you who don't know
Marlena helped me out with
I have watched her since day one and I
love really not and again Marlena I want
to thank you for everything because
without you I would have been nowhere
who do you relate to and is most similar
to you um that's really hard one because
I think that every youtuber is unique
everyone has a different style different
like personality but if I were to choose
one that would be probably Carly
Christmas dress the prettiest smile that
is going to be album a oh I'm probably
killing that name right now I love Alva
she is like a pageant girl she is
hands-down the prettiest girl on YouTube
ever like when she laughs and she likes
shows her teeth the entire world drops
and all eyes go to her teeth who is the
prettiest room um
makeup geek again because uh she doesn't
have that studio anymore but back then
she had this like curtain with pink
walls and stuff and it was the cutest
thing ever
who would you want is a big sister I'm
gonna turn this into a big brother
because I would die to have Gregory
gorgeous as my family we will be like
nuts with each other who do you always
learn something from that is pixie woo
again with every video they have like
it's whether it's like how they hold a
brush like there's a difference between
holding a brush like that this is my
finger that read the ring is killing my
finger the pixie WA sisters are
hands-down the best on YouTube okay and
the last question is who makes the most
creative videos on YouTube if it is how
they film like how they direct it it
will be Michelle Phan she has a great
great camera she has a great great style
of like putting the camera around her
eye it's it's like magic to me um but
with most creative looks I would
probably go for it see you again I'm
getting boring aren't I so yeah thank
you guys so much for watching I love you
and hopefully able to see you guys next
