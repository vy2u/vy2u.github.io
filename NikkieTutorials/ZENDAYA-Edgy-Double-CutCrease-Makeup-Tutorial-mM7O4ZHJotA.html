zendaya inspired makeup tutorials India
always slays the makeup game but when I
saw this look on Instagram and everyone
started bombarding me with requests I
was like okay I'm doing this I'm doing
this I'm doing this but before I start I
want to thank each and every one of you
because my channel hit 4 million
subscribers and I'm gonna keep it short
and sassy because if I if I go into it
too much I will cry but I love you so
much
you mean the world to me and 4 million
is a huge mouth ok I'm gonna stop now I
love you so much I love you I don't want
to cry so when I was planning this look
I was like I want to make sure that I
pronounce zendaya right so I searched
for how to pronounce zendaya and so my
mind said was like waiting for someone
to properly tell me how to pronounce
India so I go to youtube this is the
first video I click and I hear this
sword Oracle zorty door gold so I told
everyone on my snapchat about this and
people died and this channel right here
is the bomb so this channel right here
is called pronunciation manual my
favorite one is zucchini oh alright I'm
done if you want to know how to get this
is or need Orgel is about your makeup
tutorial right here then keep on
watching the first thing I'll be doing
is priming my face I'll be going in with
the NYX hydro touch primer and kim tae
Ray's about this all the time so I'm
gonna try it out today just tributed oh
if it does leave like a really nice
tacky base to work with so I'm ready for
a foundation for foundation today I'll
be using the grill and time proof
foundation in the number two base Claire
and I thought why not change it up for
once I'm not gonna use my Beauty Blender
I'm going to use a brush it's been
forever since I used to brush for my
foundation and I'm going to use the
morphe g36 brush
all right thank God that makes
definition go on beautifully I was a
little skeptical at first as I haven't
used a brush for finition forever again
it looks good it's faster than a beauty
blender to so I'm liking this and I
really like this morphe one I did in my
first time trying it so I didn't know
what to expect but it's good and I'm
really excited about that but my base is
a little bit too dark so I'm going to
lighten it up with a little bit of
concealer and by a little bit I mean a
lot so the concealers I'll be going in
with today are the Urban Decay Naked
skin concealer in fair neutral and
amazing cosmetics amazing concealer so
going in with amazing cosmetics amazing
concealer first BAM
alright never mind about the Urban Decay
concealer I'm keeping it at the amazing
concealer only and in my opinion nothing
blends concealer in like a beauty
blender so for concealer I am using the
Beauty Blender
and with a loose powder I'm going to set
my under eye area to prevent it from
creasing
and now grabbing my Armani luminous silk
powder and my morphe m4 44 and setting
the rest of my face
and then for larger areas of my face and
a switch over to the morphe 54 which I
know the classic collection by morphe is
discontinued they're no longer available
but I also know they just came out with
a brand new line the elite - collection
which is basically the same brushes but
better and I have yet to receive them I
did order a couple and once I have them
I'll let you know what I think of it on
snapchat and right here but for now I'm
using my trusty old a 54 and to
highlight my under eye area and to brush
away the Bakke and going in with Mac's
Shivering white Studio Fix powder and
I'm going to use a morphe g35 to use
this and I know these are hard to get by
I personally got mine off of ebay
because I kind of find them in the
stores anymore but maybe they're just
sold out and will come back but I don't
know I don't know and the best part
about this is that it looks absolutely
horrendous right now but once you do
your contour blush highlight everything
it will all just kind of melt in with
each other and it will just look yeah
before eyes the first thing I'll be
doing is applying a base of course to
keep this eye on all day long and I'm
using my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot for
this
a little trick to make blending easier
is applying a lighter matte eyeshadow
from creasing brow bone area and this
will just help lend anything you put
over top so much so I'm doing that right
now with a matte black eyeshadow first
going to wing out my lid and for this
I'm using a morphe M 160 1/16 brush go
ahead and fill that in and now we have a
nice direction to go with for the rest
of the lid to cut the little using the
Mac Pro Longwear concealer and a sigma
lo5 brush and with this we're going to
create our lid shape on the inner third
I'm going to set that using color train
Malibu eyeshadow and of course you want
to stay in sight that cut lit line
and on the centre village this donessa
Marik's metals pigment in sequin
now going to grab the Morphew 35 P
pallet and taking this color right here
and with a cara de 22 brush I'm going to
cut right above that line to create a
new crease and then now with a small
little more feet my 15 brush on a buff
and blend that out and I know I say this
all the time but the higher you get up
the less pressure you want to put on
that brush to make a beautiful blend you
can always go in with a large brush to
soften the edges and make it seamless on
the waterline I'll be applying you
Sephora contour inner rim gel liner in
black and going back in with my morphe
35 P palette and going into these two
colors right here for the lower lash
line using a sigma 0 5 brush to apply it
and they're right at the outer corners
you want to wing that purple out
parallel to the wing and with Anasazi
Beverly hillz pink heart I'm going to
highlight my inner corners and also
highlighting the brow bone for lashes
today I'll be using the Lily lashes in
the style goddess
all right let's move on to cheeks we're
cheating on a contour first because
India is like sculpted 2d Collins I
gotta go in with my makeup geek breakup
cool-toned I'm gonna go in with my
makeup geek breakup cool-toned contour
powder and my morphe m5 30
all right for blush I've been dying to
show you this on camera I've already
used it like so much on a day-to-day
basis Plus on a snapchat tutorial I did
last week but it's finally time to show
you this precious beauty here on camera
hero in YouTube for blush I'm going to
use the morphe 9 and blush palette to
start here's this blush palette is so
gorgeous it contains all my favorite
blush colors I really love the peachy
warm me sexy bronzy blush colors and
this is it right here all in one palette
plus it's super affordable and I'm going
to go in with this one we're here and
this one right here and applying it
using a morphe M 509 brush it is super
super pigmented so a little bit goes a
long way trust me on this one so you
definitely want to use a light hand
because if you go too strongly you're
gonna have a lot of clowns running for
their money but I look like a car right
now I love it I love my k-cup so who
cares now what I'm even more excited
about to show you on camera C I already
talked about this in my June hits and
God knows but I've never shown you like
in a video how it goes onto the face
again I did show you in my snapchat
tutorial last week but here we go
this is my artist Couture diamond glow
powder in cocoa bling when I tell you
this is making all my favorite
highlighters run for their life it's
true alright so clean up opening the
magic pot up that hot pot off and I'll
be applying it today use my morphe M 310
this makes your cheekbones look like wet
glass like sexy wet glass you know what
I never knew that in my life I wanted to
have sexy wet glass cheekbones but honey
now that I have them I will over the
bridge of the nose and the tip
I mean Zendaya's Chiefs look like a
magical shining aura of light so I think
we pretty much know that today alright
for our lips it's actually really easy
you just want a very neutral softly
glossy lip so whenever I hear that I'm
like okay we need something neutral with
like extreme gloss somehow my brains
transformed the word neutral and soft
and to extreme and out there so for
lipstick today I'm going to go in with
my tum Ford nude vanilla lipstick
because it's a beautiful nude Africa
lost overtopping them go in with this
beautiful shave right here this is beige
away it's a lip topper and the color
skinny dip something I've never done in
my life for sure and all you want to do
not to lock it all in place and get rid
of a super cakey and powdery look is set
your face with a setting spray and I'm
gonna go in with the makeup forever mist
and fix and something super random I
found out is as opposed to like spraying
your face like straight on like what you
want to do is kind of tilt your face and
come with a spray from up top and that
way this spray will kind of fall down on
truth is it just it works better it
makes me feel better so I'm going to do
it and that guys concludes this zendaya
