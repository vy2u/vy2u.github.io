back I want to start off by saying that
I have been sick since last week and I
believe it all started on Tuesday or
Wednesday and I just I got a fever and
then I got the flu and it kind of left
me without any sort of energy and I'm
just one sort of flapping fish on
dryland right now my voice sounds like a
frog
I look like a my my entire skin feels
like a dry desert where camels are
walking all over basically I've been
sick for a week now
and I feel so guilty because I normally
I upload videos like two or three times
a week and I had none like last week I
had none because I had no backups I had
nothing pre-filmed I just had nothing so
I kind of I've been in bed all the time
and I had work so I did have to work for
that and everything and that kind of
knocked me out as well I've been
watching The Real Housewives of Beverly
Hills - the entire time and oh my god I
love that show so much I want to be Lisa
Vanderpump when I grow up then I won um
so fun um anyways today I felt like I
wanted to give you guys something back
because I felt like a dickhead for not
posting any videos and block posed on my
website and everything and I'm gonna do
something today that I normally hate I
never do this because I hate these
things I'm gonna do a giveaway and I I
have some giveaways before in my youtube
career but every time I did one either
someone tried to kill me because they
don't win or they didn't believe that
that person won or whatever so I have
never really been a fan of doing
giveaways on my channel because there's
so much drama every time in my
I'm not here for that so I did get some
comments now and then in my youtube
career like you're one of the few who
doesn't do any giveaways I've done them
and like the experience was horrific and
I never wanted it again I'm not like an
awful person that doesn't give stuff
away I just I don't want the drama then
a couple of weeks ago I found out about
Rafflecopter and that is the site that
does all the work for you and I was like
that's it I'm gonna do that I don't have
like super duper highly expensive prices
I just have some stuff here that I feel
like some people are gonna be really
happy with and it's nothing big it's
just a quick sort of well thank you for
waiting and if this goes alright I want
to do more giveaways in the future I'm
just gonna wait and see how this kind of
rolls over us and yeah first prize is
I'm gonna give away three jewel in sign
by makeup studio I mentioned this and
almost every video I did because it fits
every look so I I kind of feel like
everyone needs a makeup studio jewel
effects in shine in their life so I'm
buying three and I'm gonna give away
three and yes I'm actually buying three
I know my mom sells these but I want to
buy them and give them away so it's not
like well mom can you give me like three
so it can give them away no I bought
them um then I have this Lady Gaga faint
perfume lying around that I don't use
because this is a triple up I don't have
a backup I have a triple up I have three
bottles of this and I felt like well two
is okay for now as well as I'm gonna
give away one because this is one of my
favorite smells ever so I'm gonna give
away one Lady Gaga Fame black fluid
perfume perfume sorry
yeah those are my prizes so three dual
effects in shine and one Lady Gaga faint
perfume perfume and I know it's not a
lot but this is just to kind of see how
giveaways enroll in 2013
because back in 2010 or 29 when I did my
first giveaway it was I wanted to kill
myself just like right now because I
feel like crap okay so to enter yourself
for this giveaway is Rafflecopter and
I've never used a repla copter before
but it looked really easy you can enter
yourself by going to the link down below
in the info box and to my website
nikkietutorials comm I will have a
Rafflecopter page there and what you can
do is I believe you you end her by
giving your email address and then you
can hire up your winning chances if you
follow me on Twitter if you subscribe to
my channel believe that's it I'm not
really sure but I believe that's it if
it's not on the Rafflecopter page itself
duh you have to be a subscriber to my
channel right here and I would love it
if you would follow me on Twitter
that would be nikkietutorials and that
won't mean the world to me and if you
like my facebook page but again i'm not
going to make that like a basic rule so
yeah that is the giveaway I'm gonna go
back into my bed now and watch some more
Beverly Hills housewives and I want to
get better for tomorrow because tomorrow
I actually want to film a Real
Housewives of Beverly Hills makeup
tutorial and I wanna do a review of some
sorts and yeah I'm gonna go again it was
