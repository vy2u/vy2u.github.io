mother went to 4th house to visit Hana
and or I'm just going to say Hana for
the rest of the video now and we got the
chance to get a henna experience
treatment and now you may be thinking oh
how original you're getting a massage
and you're getting your face done what's
so special about it
what I've been told is that henna works
a little bit different what henna does
is um they have skin coaches and those
coaches really look at your skin they
look at your moisture content your oil
content and your pH level and what
they're going to do is test your levels
and then from the test they know what to
do with it doesn't look at like if you
need oils if you need like less oily
stuff so they really look at your skin
and look what is good for you also skin
coaches focus more on like giving the
skin cells more oxygen leading to a more
glowy and healthy skin so this is all
about they're not just like beauticians
and and people who massage they really
look at your skin and they look at what
they can do about it if there's
something wrong and really they're
really there for your skin so today I
thought it was fun to show you the henna
experience like life when I was there
I've been using henna for two months now
and their products are absolutely
amazing I I have my sort of like routine
now every day and I am loving it my skin
has gotten more clear more healthy my
mom even liked the product so much that
she went to the course to become a skin
coach from henna and she succeeded a
couple of weeks ago so my mom is now a
skin coach as well and so she knows
every little deed and dad about skin so
every time I have a question I'm like
mom what is this and also my mom started
selling henna products in her web shop
so I go check out heckles me guys dot
and now that's her webshop and she sells
all the products am I talking about
their products before and I really
really like them anyway that's it for my
intro let's go to some of the footage of
that I shot when I got the henna
experience um I tried to make it as
clear as possible but
our camera lady she was a bit shaky and
she talked now and then and I was like
shut up I loved her for doing it though
but I was like shut up so without any
further ado let's go to the henna
experience treatment could be no even
I'm from Romania - technically AHA my
experience not a fan when you're walking
to Hannah's skincare Center one of the
girls goes to sit down with you and
together you make a quick quiz on your
skin type this way the henna coach
already kind of knows which products you
use for your skin after that you and
your coach go start measuring your skin
levels and that it's what we're going to
look at right now hydrogenation you're a

serums the middle from a massage room
Oscars calcium at approaches finish what
things you can have juice or bush I've
had
I've been massaged quite a lot before
and this was so different you really
feel that amber really knew what she was
doing with the skin and she really knew
what she had to do with her hands that
sounded so bad so the massage was kind
of rough and kind of like strong stuff
but it was good it was like really like
wow wow getting beat up and I loved it
after the massage amber put some
moisturizers on me that a moisturizer
that she put on me are the personal
choice and I use this every single day
and she also used the remodeling cream
this is actually my favorite cream from
Hannah my mom actually put a discount on
some of my favorite products she put a
10% discount on the touch of silk so
that is that right there I showed it as
so many videos already and also a
starter kit with the sensitive skin
lotion vitamin complex cleansing milk
and a cream a moisturizer there is a 10%
discount on that as well so definitely
