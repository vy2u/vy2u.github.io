today I am doing hairstyles for
back-to-school but something that's a
little different about this video is
that I am not doing any like intense
braiding French braid and Dutch braiding
and none of that because I personally
don't know how to do that so I'm going
to do like some half-up half-down kind
of buns way to kind of accessorize
different ways to style your hair
they're all heatless but yeah there's
just not going to be any insane braiding
so if you're into that this videos
probably not for you but this is a
really really easy like quick hairstyle
so if you only have like two minutes in
the morning you can definitely pull
these off and you can accessorize them
you can braid if you want at grades if
you know how but yeah they're super
versatile so if you guys want to see the
hairstyles please keep watching also
it'd be really awesome if you guys
aren't subscribed if you hit the
subscribe button and I'll have a little
button right here that you can press but
it's also down below if you're on a
phone or a tablet or whatever and yeah
that being said let's get started
so my first hairstyle is super simple
it's just an up/down like half up half
down bud so what you do is you just take
the top section of your hair you can
choose however much hair you want it
really doesn't matter just depends how
big you want your bun to be and you just
basically tie a little chop it up to the
top of your head and then I just pull up
some pieces to make it a little bit
Messier this hairstyle was in my last
video and everybody was asking me to do
a tutorial in it but it's actually super
simple so I just mess around with the
bun pull out some pieces make sure it
looks like there's no effort into it
it's super quick and that's it so fast I
know
next is ponytails what we're starting
out with so this is going to eventually
turn into a little bun so what you do is
you wrap that around your head just like
we did the half-up half-down but with
your whole head of hair and you just tie
that and then mess it up however you
would like and then I just pull out some
strands because I am the type of person
that likes kind of the messy lazy lazy
bun kind of look so then I pull out
those from pieces in my hair I just make
sure everything is really messy because
that's the look that I'm going for today
and I think it just kind of makes the
whole difference in the look because I
have a put together bun later in the
video but this is just a fun messy bun
and yeah that's that's what I'm doing
guys and then you've got yourself a
perfect messy bun next we are going to
incorporate some bandanas because why
not the first thing I'm doing is
brushing through my hair and I know I've
so rough with my hair and I need to get
better but one day at a time so what I'm
doing is I'm combing out my hair and
this is the easiest hairstyle ever I'm
just tying a blue blue bandana around
like kind of behind my ears keeping my
hair down just giving it a little bit of
kind of texture messing it up and I'm
just tying that around to give myself an
extra pop with just playing down here
you guys can do like a head scarf for a
different color bandana but it's so easy
and it's so cute I think so that's that
hairstyle the next hairstyle is really
really awesome I'm obsessed with this
one so what we're doing is just pulling
her hair back into a ponytail I think
this one is so cute and it is so simple
so what we're doing is just combing our
hair back into a ponytail you should get
it as flat as you can because it's
always nice to mess it up on yourself
instead of just having it messed up
already but you know we all have our
moments and then I'm just taking a white
bandana and tying this on at the top of
my head and I'm just going to kind of
double knot it but then as you are about
to see it looks like you have a little
bunny ear so what I like to do is just
tuck that right under so it just kind of
looks like a little circle or like
another top knot out of a bandana on her
head and it just gives like such a cute
little vibe to the look so I am obsessed
and then of course to mess it up you
know me I'm just pulling out some
strands and making it a bit Messier um
and that's basically all I did for this
one I think it's so cute
and then for this next one
I am going to do another kind of half-up
half-down but a little different this
one is no bun it's just a little
ponytail so we just gather as much hair
as you want to the top of your head like
we were doing in the other ones I am
just time this off um
just like a ponytail it's just way
easier because that's half of your hair
and then I am just going to make sure
that this has a lot of volume and height
to it because I don't like this if it's
flat on your head I think it's so much
cuter when it has texture and it's
bouncy and you can just see that it's
kind of up there you know what I'm
saying so love this one this next look
is so so incredibly easy and this is
kind of my go-to um so what I do is I
just pull my hair back into a really low
ponytail and then just tie it off so as
you can see on my right side right there
there was like the smallest bump but I
forgot to get down but it's okay you
guys can just kind of play with it how
you won't make that part smooth if you
like but I'm just tying this off and
this is basically all you do I think
it's kind of chic it's kind of like boss
man like boss woman chief I don't know I
think it's super cute though and it's so
easy next I am going to incorporate a
little braids I know I said and then
show there were no braids but I meant
like Dutch French like waterfall
whatever the hell those braids are
calling this one is just a standard
three strand braid so what I'm doing is
I am just regular braiding and as you
can tell I even struggle with this like
I am so bad at braiding so just so
people can see my mistake as much I've
decided to speed it up a little bit
because I'm so bad but I'm kinda Singh
but actually this hairstyle turned out
to be super cute so I'm just doing like
a little clock right down the center of
my forehead for like not Center my
forehead like the side of my forehead
just so it kind of comes down across and
it just looks super super cute and I
think it just kind of gives something
like a little something extra to just
plain straight hair next for this
hairstyle this is one of my favorites I
think this is adorable so we are just
middle parting and then doing a little
bun as you can see I just twist that
around my hair and then tie it off with
a little hair tie and I think that you
could rock this if you have long hair or
short hair or thick hair or thin hair
it's just such an easy look always kind
of rock so I'm just pulling down some
strands and making it super super cute
and messy
and then what I'm going to do after I
kind of mess up some of the parts and
make you know it look all messy is tie
up bandanna up in my hair and I think
this just gives something a little extra
a little more Flair to it and I think it
just kind of covers some of the mess as
well while still kind of looking cute
and messy and this isn't my intro so I
love this hairstyle I think it is so
cute this next hairstyle is really
really fun and messy and sorry I was
talking to Mel at this point but um
basically what I'm doing is I just have
my hair all over to one side whichever
you prefer and then I'm just doing a
huge thick messy braid this would look
so cool if you just have really thick
hair I have thick hair and never know
what to do with it and now this is like
kind of my go-to because it's so messy
but I love it that way I don't think
would look nearly as cute if it was me
so I am obsessed with this I know that
it's kind of something that only some
people might like but I think it's
really fun and I think it's messy which
is as you can tell my favorite type of
hair for this hairstyle this one is
pretty basic as well if I'm going to be
honest so the first thing we're doing is
just tying our hair up and then sorry
I'm talking to Mel so I'm like mouthing
things but it's not to you guys um so
I'm just tying my hair up in a nice
little pony and then once I do that I'm
going to do another braid so this is
pretty basic it's just a standard braid
once again speeding it up because I'm
slow and bad with braiding but I just
make sure that it looks somewhat like a
braid and then after I just tie it off
and then of course mess it up a little
bit because what's an Olivia in your
time without pulling some strands so I'm
just pulling the front pieces and my
side pieces and just making sure that it
looks effortless even though we put a
little effort into it and that's it and
it's the cutest most simple hairstyle
I'm obsessed with it and I hope you guys
try it because it's so easy um this next
hairstyle is going to be real easy so
the first thing we're going to do is
spray some a dry shampoo and make sure
our hair has a little bit of more like
you know texture and like or not like
but kind of like alt you know
and what I'm doing is I'm just going to
tie this into a ponytail with a middle
part but it's not going to be kind of
that classy when we did at the beginning
it's not going to be a low ponytail it's
going to be kind of higher as you can
tell so I'm just pulling this to the top
of my head and then I'm going to tie it
off with a hair tie and this is the same
old roll I didn't tell my hair styles
are kind of similar but in the same way
they're different and they are super
easy so again pulling out all the
strands and then pulling out my side to
pieces and then I am just tying my chop
little bandana again you know the drill
I've done this quite a few times but
each are the little difference so don't
get too mad at it and then I'm just
tying that all over and making sure it's
kind of the way I like it make sure it's
nice and messy and bam easiest hairstyle
ever I am Telling You and then to finish
off this hair tutorial I am going to do
a really perfect neat bun so to start
this out I'm combing my hair out and
putting it in a high ponytail and then
taking another ponytail after twisting
my hair kind of in a little cinnamon bun
kind of looking and twisting it up again
and then I'm just twisting that around
and making sure it's the way I want it
and then I'm just spraying dry shampoo
or whatever kind of hair product do you
have hairspray works a little hair oil
whatever you have to just keep it down
and kind of tidy the whole thing up you
could also use a toothbrush to do this
but I just had to use my hands because
it's the morning for school it's quick
and easy and super super cute and that's
your perfect top knot thank you so much
