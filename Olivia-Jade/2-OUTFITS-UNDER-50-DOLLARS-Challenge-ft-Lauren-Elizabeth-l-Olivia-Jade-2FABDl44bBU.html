back to my channel I'm again filming do
it again you did your last video then
you have no idea what we're talking
about basically we're doing I just
follow my gum okay so we're doing the
$50 Alpha challenge we did this last
time we both picked out an outfit for
under $50 we went to H&amp;amp;M last time so we
had the brilliant idea to now do it
online forever 21 that means I can link
it down below for you guys that's super
easy it was a lot easier but what it was
like fun doing it you know I was like
going through all the pages I mean it
had to go for everyone in real life who
there's not very many good ones in Los
Angeles they're close by oh yeah they're
not close and they're also just like
such a joke yeah there's very messy and
we got the good Pickens also I looked up
a promo code for mines okay ten dollars
over in my promo code got $10 off so I
was like I was shut up I have a thing
that like shows me promo codes but it
didn't work I think it worked for one
thing but then I had to like next day
ship it cuz I waited so like funny
dollar shipping okay so Lauren I'm gonna
show you guys what she got for me she
picked up two outfits we're doing like a
daytime and then yeah so we're doing
daytime and nighttime and the daytime is
like more spring because we do more
casual for you just like everyday and so
for the daytime I did like spring like
dress like whoo I'm cute I'm going to
brunch early yeah I'm going somewhere
cute whatever okay I'm over it already
okay so this I actually really like this
outfit and I'm a little upset because I
found this dress and it looks exactly
like the one I have from Realization par
and it was $22 and the one what is zero
it's like 100 something dollars it I
like literally held them next to each
other they they're because I realize
you're gonna poke it out yeah it's like
the exact same dress
have it you even sir my Instagram
picture right here I love a party and
its really good I like it Brad you have
it looks like chair Garen is heaven so
this is the Polka Dot version oh my god
this is soaked it's soaking it feels
nice like it's yeah literally feels
example high utilization one it crosses
in the front and then since it's daytime
I decided to do sneakers with it because
I also saw you wear sneakers with yours
um Super Bowl Sunday yeah you did and it
looks so cute and they're like a red pop
on the bag because I like wearing that
together they also kind of look like you
cheese for some reason to us when I say
that's me and Liza the over we were like
we were like they look like blue cheese
and I got another one that like had like
the patches on it that were more geared
for like we're gonna walk it off
so we did that I got you the other two
that's some I see your mom I like
whenever I wear like a deep Z well and
not as easy you can see I like layering
so I did like a little layer necklace
situation this is a common theme for
Lauren listen I like jewelry and I like
layering jewelry but I think it screw up
it I love this first of all if you like
it Oh cute yeah my favorite part about
this video I think is that like I'm
obsessed with your style and then I get
to keep everything I know you do good
night it's really cute and then you can
wear like a red lip with it yeah
my first love I mean it's cute as hell
okay wait so talk to me I mean I love
the lobby I love this slit it makes you
look it's really flattering because it
doesn't feel like too much of your tummy
it flows so it's comfy yeah okay the
thing I do like about this though is as
affordable as it was of a solid $5.90
what I hate is when things are attached
and this actually is two pieces which I
like because then you could like wear
that by itself like maybe you should do
just these two with this and then save
that for the other one yeah yes I do
thank you very much so you like you look
like a lady like this is a this is an
outfit it might be a little too booby
but like it's like I'm meeting my
friends a little boys who feel this is
an outfit where it's like I'm meeting my
boyfriend's parents for the third time
not the first time but like it would've
done every time yeah like it's not too
movie we have AK track to wear in a
video that was like a brand deal and
they were like okay sweet I'll go change
so cute like I think you look like a
lady like the pop of color on the shoes
from really cute look at that Yas Queen
very flattering it's very ladylike it's
very significant opulent it's like it's
not um too thick or anything slick even
though you're wearing a lot of clothing
you mean you're not but like I don't get
hot like URI you have room to breathe
this is very I'm going to brunch I'm
being my best self love this and I might
have a glass of Rose egg because I I can
you got you but like I deserve well I
can't out in the country this is I'm
going to eat leave and I can have as
much
it's so cute I love it
you know this new welcome all right
let's get now get ready for night time
over then I felt a nighttime look I was
thinking ooh you're going into the club
you don't go to the club because you're
12 but like if you were going to the
clutter or like you're going to a house
party or you're just like you're trying
to take a hot Instagram page okay I
don't I mean that you're looking for him
[Laughter]
I know we did like inspired by inglés
yeah yeah but like it was like it was a
little far-fetched
we don't you can tell them to give
ourselves away more credit yeah these
literally look like the IMG of pants you
know like the camo more like not the
camo but like the you know like the you
know what I mean
ya know what I mean what I'm saying you
know how they have a chain this one guys
like this belt they looked really cute
online on the model which could
obviously be deceiving but they're
basically like the IMG black pants or
the good thing is is like have you tried
the ing one summer there look really big
yeah thank you and they look like
parachute pants you know these aren't
more fitted it sounds like what they
would look like after Kourtney
Kardashian tailors them for you well
like she doesn't Taylor than for you
she's like really and then you're a bad
you know you're hot so we're just tube
topping it you're just like I'm going
out I'm here I've arrived I've arrived
in there this is cute I didn't get you
necklaces with that one since you just
make fun of my necklace but you we're
gonna ask me something looks like silver
silver so I mixed metals I don't know
why I do that too
and then you could like you know like
toss on like a fun boot this is not
forever 21 but yeah it would look cute I
know it's a little boring
you know it's cute be like put on like a
red lip I said we liked it me like I
liked it we uv-resistant I like the jail
do shop excu she does tells would cute
because she's young and hot yeah she's
hip and cool you like it yeah these
actually
cute on yeah I'm really excited to try
all this on so I would have got a more
fun top but I was on a budget and I
understand it was hard
guys this is this you can't really see
but you you already some already solid
but it's super cute the Bella is really
long I don't I think it like comes
really long but we tied it in certain
way so that it like tangles in the front
looks super cute
also you can obviously take the belt off
you can add a little Gucci gold G or a
statement belt of your choice of that
even could add cheetah because I'm all
about you issues but they're like very
generally they're like very clearly
cargo pants they're like super trendy
they're super and they were definitely
like a little more expensive like
they're like $40 or something that's why
I had to get this but this also does
like a good material you don't have to
wear a bra with it it's like a comfy
going out out there where you like look
like you're trying really hard but
you're just like so comfy you're ready
to twerk you're ready to grind you're
ready to topple now yeah I mean you like
but it's like super cute and you can
like since they're in black you can mix
and match alot you can be where them
grew um yeah and these are just super in
right now that I click thing they look
so much better than I am
geo ones like yeah I literally bought
the ing ones for almost two hundred
dollars and I tried them on and I was
laughing at myself in the mirror yeah I
was like I look like an idiot and they
