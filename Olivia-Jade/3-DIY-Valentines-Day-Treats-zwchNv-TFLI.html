my channel today's video is three easy
DIY Valentine's Day treats for you guys
if you guys do want to see the treats
that I came up with then just keep
watching but really quickly I just want
to apologize for not posting for a whole
month I feel so bad I'm so so so so so
sorry about that I promise they won't
happen again it was just crazy but I
hope you guys all have an amazing
January and yeah because you want to see
the treats that I came up with and just
keep watching so I just made these
little popcorn basket bins and they
turned out very cute um
maybe you'll have better aim than I did
but I had a bit of trouble getting it
into the actual basket but that's okay
they turned out cute afterwards and I
thought like it kind of looked cute in
the video with the popcorn all around
and then I put those little circus
animals um like this video if you
remember those from when you were
literally eight years old and I just put
them on top of the popcorn because I
thought they looked cute and they were
in the color scheme for Valentine's Day
so next I made festive Oreo cookies and
I put some vanilla food dye oh wait no I
do put vanilla icing and then mixed it
with red food dye I did not put vanilla
food dye and then obviously white and
red make pink which looked very cute
even though the decorations kind of
covered them up but it's okay I just
pretend it looked cute and it was kind
of in the spirit and the thought of it
so after you mix that up I just took my
Oreo cookie and dumped it in the
frosting and then the topping of your
choice and then I did another one and
that other Oreo with the rainbow
sprinkles I covered half of it and then
for this one I covered it with stars if
you guys are making these for guests
maybe don't use your fingers cuz that's
kind of gross I was just eating these
myself in my hands or wash so and it's
okay but if you are using them for like
a party use a knife or something that's
my suggestion so next and lastly we made
sugar cookies and they were very festive
and cute so we did 1 tablespoon of flour
we did 1 egg I believe yeah 1 egg and
then we did a third stick of butter and
our microwave was broken but make sure
it's softened butter we tried to cut it
up hoping that it would melt easier but
you know it worked a little bit so then
we just mixed it and then we rolled the
dough into like a flat thing right there
and then as you can see we're taking a
rolling pin and rolling that out umm my
sister and I had a little bit of trouble
with this part so maybe a better role in
pin would work better but after we
eventually got it out and smooth then I
took these Valentine's Day cookie
cutters that I got off of Amazon for
like $10 and we just placed them on the
dough and then as you can see in a
couple seconds just wait for it wait for
it okay I'm just gonna tell you they
look really deformed see deforms very
deformed if you took a little more time
with it I'm sure it would look great the
cookie cutters were
good overall our we're just not really
great bakers um anyway we just left them
in the oven for like maybe seven minutes
we just kind of waited until they were
like a golden-brown color and then we
decorated them with the pink frosting
that we mixed for our Oreo cookies and
then put some red sprinkles and just
different decorations on top so that's
it for my Valentine's Day video I hope
you guys all enjoyed and you know what
you guys think thank you all so much for
watching and I will see you my next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
