hope you're having a wonderful day I
have a really exciting video today I am
showing you three different holiday
inspired super quick and easy makeup
looks I'm using Sephora collection cream
lip stains and I'm using the shades pink
latte I have always red and then I also
have a shade rosewood which is whatever
no my lips right now also you guys I
think I'm most excited because Sephora
collection has come out with 27 new
cream lip stains I've gone in this bag I
will public a little overlay right now
of all the different colors but I love
them they're absolutely gorgeous and
this brings that whole collection of
cream lip stains to 40 beside backwards
I'll do it this way just gave it also
want to say thank you so much to a
Sephora collection for partnering with
me on this video I am so honored and I'm
so excited so with that being said let's
just get started
so for look one I'm using the shade
always red and I'm starting out with my
eyes I am just blending a light brown
into my crease for a transition shade
and I just sped it through this real
quick because you guys see it all the
time any shade you have would work and I
am just blending this in to give myself
a little bit of dimension so that when
we do apply the lip stain it looks
really really good and I'm keeping this
shadow pretty light because I want the
lip stain to stand out I bring in the
exact same light brown just on my lower
lash line and running that under I'm
taking some lighter shades applying them
to my inner corner and a little bit on
at the top of my eyelid and then I'm
straightaway going in with my lashes so
falsies these are Sephora collection of
false eyelashes and I'm just applying
them real quick with some tweezers
and there BAM they're on I'm then
applying a little bit of mascara and
moving straight on to Sephora collection
creamy lip stain in the shade always red
this is stunning you guys it's so high
coverage it glides on so smoothly like
you can see right here it literally
doesn't I don't understand and this is
kind of gross but I in really chapped
lips and the fact that this past the
chapped lip test and it's a lip stain is
insane to me
and also it kind of goes from like a
really creamy silky texture to a
lightweight stain so it's really
gorgeous and then that's that look and
it's super easy and quick and I'm
obsessed with the red it's perfect for
the holiday season and once again it's
in the shade always red so number two
look - I'm using Sephora collection
cream lip stain in pink latte I'm just
adding to this look and I'm taking a
darker shimmer shade and just applying
this to my lid I'm again
speeding through this but you can kind
of see what I'm doing here and after I
do that I'm deepening it with some gold
just to make it a little bit more
festive perfect for the holiday season
and I'm also just applying that under my
lower lash line
so yeah it's even and then I'm using
Sephora collection cream lip stain in
the shade of pink latte this is stunning
once again I am just applying this all
over my lips and look how creamy and
juicy and pretty is the color is
gorgeous and also the stains come in
matte finishes and satin finishes so
whichever you prefer I love them both
this when it dried matte was like no
words no words look it it's just like
the perfect nude pink in my opinion and
I've been looking for a shade like this
for so long so I'm basically in love I
found my boyfriend it's really cool
super cute but yeah that's how my second
look and it's a little bit toned down so
if you're not into red lips for look 3
this is the edgy it's definitely the
most badass I am using spore collection
cream lip stain in the shade rosewood
and what I'm doing with my eye look here
is I'm just deepening and darkening it
up I'm taking just any darker colors
like this purple and black blending it
my outer third of the lid just because
since this shade is so rich and dark and
creamy and amazing um I just want to
darken up my eyes so it kind of matches
the same vibe and I'm bringing those
darker shades also my lower lash line
and then taking Sephora collection cream
lip stain in Rosewood this is stunning
and I'm applying this to my lower leg
muscle over lash line that would be
weird
oh hi get two of my lips and this is so
creamy as you can see I often find it
really really difficult to work with
dark colors but for some reason these
lip stains make it super easy to go on
and this when dried matte and it's
gorgeous and that's the third and final
look I didn't show my face makeup for
any of these because you guys see that
all the time but I hope you enjoyed
these three looks I love them thank you
