cerise Baba what you you got the baby
Longman's hey guys it's Olivia and
welcome back to my channel today I have
filmed three easy healthy snack ideas
for you guys and I filmed with my friend
rocky come here so if you guys do want
to see the treats and snacks and how to
recreate them then just keep watching
but if you do recreate them will you
please tag me in a picture you've got an
Instagram or Twitter or send me a
snapchat my snapchat will be linked down
below okay I hope you guys all enjoy the
video and if you guys do want to see it
then just keep watching so the first
thing we made were granola Apple bites
and my friend rocky here is just cutting
the Apple I don't know what angle you
would call that but you can see what
she's doing and then after we're done
cutting the apples up we're gonna just
cut the core out as you can see here if
you guys don't really know how to use a
knife maybe just ask somebody in your
family to help you that's older if you
don't feel comfortable but we're just
cutting the core out which makes it like
a cute little sandwich for the peanut
butter which we spread on top if you
guys want to be a little bit healthier
you guys can use like almond butter and
then we just put some granola on top and
it tasted really good you'll see my
reaction in just a couple of seconds
five four three two one
reaction oh you're not seeing it yet it
was really good though you can see now
- husband is
when you need
so the next thing we made were fruit
parfaits and the first thing you do is
just take the yogurt and you just put it
as a layer for the granola to go on top
of and then you can choose whatever
fruit you guys like fast we chose
blueberries and strawberries because it
looked cute it tasted good and we found
it on Pinterest and then after you're
done putting the fruit you put another
layer of yogurt and then we just took
like Chobani Greek yogurt I believe just
the original flavor whatever you guys
prefer though and then we put more
granola on top I'm a spaz I've spilled
the granola I'm going to drop the
blueberry off the counter cuz I'm really
clumsy and then we put more strawberries
on top and it tasted really good and it
looked cute and it was very easy to make
and then for just another example if
you're picky like I am I don't like
blueberries so or Greek yogurt so I put
strawberry yogurt and then I did granola
and more strawberries on top and then
strawberry yogurt again and then granola
and the most strawberries on top and
then finishing with more yogurt and then
a little bit of granola on top it's the
last move of my problem like the weather
when that's conveyed so next we created
some turkey wraps for you guys and the
first thing you're going to need is just
a wheat tortilla ours had quinoa and
very healthy ingredients in it and then
we layed it some turkey on top of it and
this is just homestyle turkey if you
were wondering and then we put some
green leaf lettuce on top and tomatoes
but you guys can choose whatever
toppings you guys like or prefer or you
guys can just leave it with plain Turkey
if you're picky and then we rolled the
tortilla and you put a little bit of
toppings a little bit too much so if you
guys want to cut down on the top and you
can it will make it easier to roll and
then we just cut down the middle and
yeah it tasted good and if you want a
little more flavor you can add a
dressing or sauce whatever you guys like
