hi guys welcome back to my channel as
you can tell I am doing five outfit
ideas for back-to-school and I'm
actually collabing with one of my best
friends on YouTube Mel I'm sure you guys
know her Mel joy I will have her video
linked down below but it will be 5 more
outfits for you guys so let's get
started this top is from Alexander Wang
I know it's a little bit expensive but
there are so many dupes to just a stripe
crop high-neck my pants are forever 21
and my shoes are super gasps I love this
outfit because it's a really great way
to look fashionable but also be so cozy
because the pants are slap pants outfit
number two this dress is from a company
called Wilfred but it's carried at a
Canadian store called a ritzy ax it's
actually my sister's but I just saw a
cute idea would be a nice little maxi
dress paired with some casual white
converse or whatever you have you guys
can totally modify this to whatever you
have in your closet already but yeah I
really love this outfit and I think it's
just a really comfy and cute way to look
stylish okay so for this third outfit
this is one of my personal faves the top
is just a banty from brandy melville
they have so many cute panties there I
think they're perfect for school
especially if you're just trying to look
casual the shorts are one teaspoon I
don't know what the length limit is for
your school or the rules but whatever
jean shorts you have that might be long
enough will totally work I paired it
with some black converse and as you guys
could kind of see in the last clip I had
a little white bandana tied to my short
just for a little bit of I don't know
spice to your outfit whatever your
feeling
this outfit is my absolute favorite I am
telling you I am obsessed so this top is
from brandy melville um the shoes are
from ASOS and the pants my beloved pants
are from Topshop
I have reborn this outfit two dinners if
I could have free dress to school I
would wear this I think it's such a cute
and classy way of being casual for my
last outfit I wanted to show you guys a
cute way to style leggings so these
adorable leggings are from Lululemon and
I just paired them with my shoes from
this company called ash and they're just
kind of platform black sneakers and then
for my top you guys will see a clip in
just a second but really taking these
sneakers right now the top is from
Victoria's Secret I don't think they
make this anymore but I'm sure you guys
could find something similar to it and
that is it for all my outfits thank you
so much for watching I hope you enjoyed
it and I will see you guys next time bye
love you
