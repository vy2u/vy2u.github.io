back to my youtube channel today's video
is a fullface drugstore no makeup makeup
tutorial
perfect for back-to-school so the first
thing I'm doing is priming the skin with
this L'Oreal magic Lumi primer I'm using
this little stippling brush from
colour-pop and I'm applying this all
over my face this is going to make your
foundation look so glowy and healthy
underneath which is just going to add to
that you know natural no makeup look so
I'm just blending this all over my face
starting at my cheekbones and then
blending outward then foundation I'm
using this L'Oreal True Match Lumi
cushion foundation in the shade w3 and
I'm just lightly applying this all over
the skin with that same brush I actually
use this stippling brush for every
single face product because I wanted to
show you you don't have to have a bunch
of different brushes to create a really
gorgeous look for school and it's
affordable and it's easy
so I'm then using this fit me kind not
concealer powder translucent powder
right under my eyes I'm actually
skipping concealer entirely because I
think it can take up throughout the day
and then it's not a no makeup makeup
look but if you look cakey throughout
the whole entire day so this is just
going to be great to put in the t-zone
to keep the oiliness down and that's
basically all I'm doing for powder I'm
then going to go in with a cream contour
stick this one is by NYX and I am just
applying this under my cheekbones this
is going to warm up the skin get a
little bit of dimension same brush to
blend it out I like this one a lot it's
very affordable and it's actually really
easy to blend so would recommend that if
you're on a budget and then this little
elf cream blush is adorable I just put
this on my cheekbones I think it gives a
lovely little flush of color and it
makes you look really healthy and then
using this BH Cosmetics bronzer it's a
powder bronzer
I don't know if BH Cosmetics is sold in
stores but I considered it drugstore
because it's super affordable and I'm
just warming up my cheeks with this then
this brow pencil is so good it's from
ELF so it's very very cheap and I'm just
using this in my brows to fill in this
bar
areas and basically that's it I'm just
filling them in and then using the elf
brow gel to set them down and make them
look a little bit fluffier I love the
bushy brow look I think it is so in and
then using this Maybelline master liquid
highlighter I'm using that on the same
stippling brush and the reason I'm using
a brush is because it makes it look ten
times more natural way more sheer so it
doesn't look like you have highlighter
on your face it kind of looks like your
natural oils are just perfect and
glowing and then I'm setting that all
with my NYX dewy setting spray a little
bit of lower lash mascara by BH
Cosmetics I'll link it down below
I have eyelash extensions so I didn't
put it on the top but I would have if I
didn't have extensions and then to top
it off I'm doing a little bit of this
lip smackers lip chopstick thing in
strawberry and that's it bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
