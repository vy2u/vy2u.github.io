youtube channel today I have a special
guest
Floria is me trying to talk like you I
don't know why that started and it just
never stopped I know and I regret it one
time you kind of stopped it and then
everyone was like oh I really liked it
you gotta give the people what they want
so today if you haven't seen Lauren's
video yet then you wouldn't know what's
up we are doing the $50 outfit challenge
so basically we went to hmm we each
picked out an outfit for each other okay
so I'm currently trying to find an
outfit for Lauren our budget is 50 we're
an H&amp;amp;M can you imagine if I gotta do you
she would kill me she would kill me this
is cute it's $20 it could work but also
I couldn't to go like these are cute I
don't know any of your sizes like that's
I like that oh but it's $50 dang it
there's only $9 like this could be cool
how much is this this is $20 this was
like beachy shorts what do you guys
think okay I've made it to the men's
section but I think we could maybe find
some cuter stuff okay that's $60 so
that's not gonna work I'm just I'm like
basic hoodies oh my god I found a rack
that's only $12 that's lit a five dollar
rack oh my god oh because it's all
winter stuff no why are these a large
these would be so cute on her what are
these
why's is hard maybe just go with like a
basic white shirt and I crop it for her
oh no she needs extra small yeah we're
gonna crop this we need fun pants okay
let me show you guys my vibe so far so
the shirt is nine dollars and it's just
a white shirt we can crop it are these
ugly I really don't know I can't tell
like is that gonna look cute probably
not okay we're gonna do this these might
be too big but we're gonna try Oh
the bottoms have pearls on them I'm
going with a different approach now and
you can't see oh this is nine dollars
getting about Tina's I actually really
like these pants and they're only 29 so
we're gonna go with this and then we
found this shirt that's on sale for nine
dollars so I think I'm gonna cut it so
it's cropped for her and then this
that's cute it's not very like special
but it's cute so what's that total
that's ten dollars plus 30 so it's
already 40 so I only have 10 more
dollars to spend
Oy
Oh been into it okay let's close enough
we're doing a $50 outfit Charlie yeah
isn't it worth it I showed Lauren's
outfit on her Channel oh really
okay so we're like who's H&amp;amp;M back do we
need anyway if you guys want to see what
I picked out for Lauren then click the
link down below
Olivia Jade's styled she's a stylist now
true
my hair looks super ugly like shut up I
picked out I picked out an outfit for
Olivia from hmn that was under $50
without tax it was $50 in like 90 cents
they're going to shore with past tax was
759 so I did it whatever really did get
you an outfit under $50 and it was like
a struggle at first because I just
didn't I don't want to be boring but
then I realized I'm boring well I was
like I'm boring I'm just like why don't
I just do it an outfit inspired by what
I wear and make you dress like me so I'm
gonna just turn you into me from I love
that I love like my favorite that's I'm
so good with that so the first thing I
got to was these West jeans and these
are inspired from like rag-and-bone
which is probably like $200 I mean I
totally see what you're saying and these
are $19.99 I don't even see these in the
store and they even have like the matte
black button that I really like that's
why I got my jeans from Topshop is to
say it's the best black and it was cute
so those are only $20 jeans and you can
see them on camera they're like shiny so
they're like fancy-schmancy I got the
exact same white shirt thank you swear
to God and so I wasn't planning on
cutting it I was hey I may be doing the
crap job yes I feel it has what I really
wanted to do which you are smart enough
to do is make a bell and they had this
like cheetah
lanyard and I was gonna turn it into a
bell like their feet about to like do
like a pop
style but it's gonna find a cheat about
and like in normal life I would just put
a Gucci belt on it but they don't sell
it at H&amp;amp;M so everything you can do that
then it's not over sister we have your
fake Gucci slides these are cute are
they so good these are like they're only
these are $24.99 so the big the two
biggest items were the jeans and the
shoes and then luckily the shirt was
only like five bucks yeah and then we
got our super lucky and we got to fake
love AJ earrings for three dollars they
look exactly like the love AJ one
they're ghosts the doors are so no door
to so bend is probably fella that's our
dog don't they look exactly like love AJ
also yes they do and also I really
wanted a pair of bolt III something and
then they're they're literally perfect
we bought an extra pair then to like add
some spice because how is this under 50
I'm super confused on when they look at
double gold layer since I always wear
like a million necklaces with like a
white tee like I'm doing right now yeah
we did a little layer and this was also
$3 Lauren you really nailed this one
what can I say I'm judged this style my
god you are so this is like what I would
wear in real life just from H&amp;amp;M and
usually I would wear like Topshop jeans
a shop redone shirt love AJ and
something and then Gucci slides and now
it's all under $50
you killed it I feel like I should have
a queer eye but like firming you should
do more style videos for your followers
yeah I think we should Olivia add
something else to my plate you know what
I mean yeah I get you the main reason I
don't do style videos it's cuz I hate
taking my clothes off when it's a try on
haul I'm like that sounds like anxiety
how do you do that Dallas say hello say
hello to the followers I love a good
oversized boyfriend team it's like ooh I
just woke up at my boyfriend's house
cute but I don't have that looks really
cute like that literally looks like
something I would wear I know I should
shop at H&amp;amp;M more that's the takeaway in
this video is that I spend too much
money on clothing that's unnecessary
wow you look like me but prettier and
nicer no this was my outfit you want to
like go into depth with each thing your
idea behind this so this outfit was
inspired by just like a daytime to
nighttime look so you can wear like the
shoes obviously I didn't get another
pair of shoes but you could totally
throw on a leather jacket or like a pair
of black booties that's literally all I
wear is white t-shirt black and the
reason these jeans look nicer is because
they're waxed like you can see that mine
are like more denim and yours are like
shiny and then the shoes are inspired by
slides because I'm lazy and so I work
two slides like every single day so it's
honestly a good investment right
um but obviously you can just get like a
$30 version from H&amp;amp;M and the gold
detailing matches with the gold jewelry
it's like another thing you could do is
just add a belt if you want to make it
through and then I love a gold hoop are
you so cute makes you look just way more
chic you're like you how you were a hoop
you have such good style and it's like
no I just have holes in my ears this is
just a really easy look to dress up to
dress down and they're all pieces that
you can wear like every day Louis yeah
totally also if you guys don't like
these sides because it was hard to shop
in store like these aren't the best
knockoff Gucci sides I've ever seen
forever21 online has really cute ones
I'll link them below for you forever 21
has really good Madden dupes yeah I
don't love the Steve Madden ones as much
as the forever 21 so I would recommend
doing that but also just like shopping
online at places like forever 21 H&amp;amp;M
Zara
is a little more expensive yes but you
can really see what it's supposed to
look like online whereas in story you're
kind of just like guessing that's a
that's a very good idea that you know
you're very next year hit my mic and
then I was like no I'm not Mike I'm not
sure and I don't know so good like you
literally look like you're not wearing
an under $50 outfit yeah
why spend more than 50 when you don't
look 101 on a budget okay so this was it
for this video make sure to check out
Lauren's and if you guys want to see
what I picked out for her then
definitely go and watch it's kind of
similar we have really similar stuff we
do but it's still really fun and it was
actually really challenging to do this
under $50 I told my friend we were doing
this and he was like she don't we do
$100 we're gonna make it yeah we got
that it's like I'm glad we did 50
because it was more of a challenge and
we do I made it work yeah
