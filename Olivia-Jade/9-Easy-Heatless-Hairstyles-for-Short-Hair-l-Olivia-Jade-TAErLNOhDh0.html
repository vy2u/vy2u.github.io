youtube channel my name is Lilia Jade if
you're new here what's up I am showing
you some hairstyles for my short hair
now I recently taught my hair you guys
missed the vlog I'll link it down below
but yeah she gone I'm the worst at hair
so I've had to try and find really easy
hairstyles that don't require heat or
effort or anything because I realized I
don't even know how to curl short hair
anymore I just got semi-decent
and that's still bad at curling long
hair so it's been a really big struggle
I just thought I'd do some Heelys
hairstyles that I've been going for
lately I'm not claiming that these are
like great or amazing or revolutionary
they're honestly pretty bad but I like
them I think it's cute it's messy it's
kind of like model off-duty vibes so if
you want to see what I've been doing and
then just keep watching I love you guys
and I hope you enjoyed okay so for
hairstyle number one it's just going to
be two little braids so you can part
your hair however this is super easy and
it's gonna play into our next hairstyle
you just take one section and do normal
braids I prefer doing this like super
messy and like tousle if you don't know
how to braid I promise you can learn
because if I can braid anyone can braid
cuz I can't do any sort of fancy braids
so you just take the three strands of
hair and repeatedly twist them like this
but so nice about sure hair is
everything so fast I'm the worst at hair
and I still think it's cute see like
that looks so cute and I love the idea
and look of like a little baby braids
they're so cute okay and then you just
do the exact same thing to this side so
you split your hair into three sections
I like doing the front pulling it back
first because then it's like out of your
face my hair is like almost not long
enough to do this yeah I just twist as
much as I can and then when it kind of
gets like hard I just tie it off okay so
once that is done I like to just grab it
you can pull some pieces out this is the
look I think it's just so cute and
little and I'm really into short hair
because of this hairstyles been doing it
all the time
so that's first the next look I'm gonna
keep the braids for right now and I just
take any sort of like missed something
that's gonna get your hair a little bit
wet so it kind of holds the shape of the
braid you'll see what I mean so I'm just
taking this curled kwench
oil hydrating mist and I'm just gonna
kind of spray like right where the curl
of the braid is okay and then I take my
hair out of that and it kind of gives it
like a little bit of shape nothing crazy
just like a little little bit now what I
like to do is take some sort of like
texture spray so this one is by igk I
just mess it up like this and that's
literally my second hairstyle I know
it's nothing crazy if you just wanted to
add a little something to your hair have
like a little crimp that's that my hair
shorter in the back too sorry this bra
doesn't cook I have a mat for the third
hairstyle for this one I like to put my
hair half up half down it's almost like
I'm just taking it really messy like
this and then I just kind of do like a
little bun this one's mostly like trial
and error for me sometimes it looks good
I'm done it then I just take a little
bit more texture spray Chloe pieces out
I think it's so cute you just tie it up
like that
BAM you can make little pieces like this
I like to leave out for like the little
messy effect but if you want to like pin
it or just use your hair tie to push it
in you total again my fourth look so you
can part your hair to whatever side you
like I like my part going like not like
I mean a side part whatever side part
you like better so either this way or
this way yeah I like this way better
okay so once you get your side part just
make sure it's brushed off into your two
different sections
cool and then I just take my hair and
hold it and then I brush down this I
never know how easy short haired girls
had it for hair styling
it makes life so much easier and then
once it's all flat I just take it into a
little ponytail and then right before I
go through my full pony I stop like this
and pull so it's like a little half bun
Pony situation that usually works better
let me do one more loop there see I
don't but it just is like this really
cute little sleek bun and then if you
want to pull out a few front pieces to
frame your face you totally can yeah
super cute so so then again just my
other one is parting it to whatever side
you like I notice with short hair I like
having a side part more than a middle
part now so that's something to think of
if you don't like your short hair try
parting it so this is my next hairstyle
I know the this one on the other one
where it was down are just basic but
it's how I've been wearing my hair so I
thought I'd show you this next woman it
is going to be a middle part so get it
as best as you can
my mole parts are never perfect if you
want to know the secret about me so I
just brush it out and then I just take
like this and throw it directly back
like this and then just do a little
ponytail tie that tight can use like an
oil if you want to do super sleek hair
but since I'm going somewhere after this
I don't want my hair to be oily so
that's what this one looks like
obviously really basic but I don't know
I like it what do you think and then I
have another up doom if you can't tell I
suck at hair so I'm showing you the
basic of the basic maybe you just
haven't thought to do this yet I'm not
saying like these are expert hair size
because clearly they're not um this next
one I'm gonna do another side part cool
and then see it just looks so cute I
love to our hair after I do my little
side part I like to bring it up like
this obviously it's gonna be crazy at
first so just kind of like brush it out
work with it whatever you gonna do and
then I just like going like this and
then the back is always a crazy part I
like that the back though always gets
like a little bit of height
and then I just take it and do a really
quick like Pony bun that sort of thing
you can just brush back any part okay so
I just bring out these two little pieces
and leave them kind of like behind my
ear or you can bring them forward it's
like a little messy or high ponytail
it's nothing crazy once again my other
hairstyles show you honey so you act
like you're going full pony and then the
more you bring it up kind of like the
more falls down you can get like a
general idea what you want to look like
and I just bring it up and do a super
messy top ponytail like this and then I
bring out the sides hey I guess what I'm
gonna add texture spray if you want more
hair below obviously just don't put on
top but so the next I'm gonna do is just
kind of like a mid fun with all your
hair back so I just go like this and I
take it like to here also just your
little pony to safe but I just like to
do much as I can up there and then you
know some of it fell which I'm fine what
you don't like that you can obviously
pin it up I'm all about like the messy
look so just like that I don't know it's
not anything like crazy it's just like a
little messy ponytail it's something
that I do or a little bun like just you
throw it up and it's like no effort
required sort of thing so that is it for
this video thank you guys for watching
I'm not claiming that these are like
some revolutionary hairstyles I'm just
showing you like my go-to style since
I've chopped my hair so this is you

also suck at hair and you literally have
