I am filming an eyelash Q&amp;amp;A for you guys
I am so excited about this but besides
just eyelashes I'm actually gonna be
talking about self-tan and spray chance
as well just because I have gotten a
ship engines before has gone right now
and I do self-tan and I have gotten
spray tans I want to you know give some
insight to people that don't know or
don't know what to expect or just have
questions and they don't know that ask
so if you guys want to be a part of
future q and A's you can follow my
Twitter which will be right here on the
screen and all my social medias linked
down below I don't really care if you
fall it or not your choice but um
yeah if you guys do want to know a
little bit more about eyelash extensions
spray tans or self-tanning then just
keep watching the first question is from
Riley who I believe I met at VidCon and
it says favorite non streaky self tanner
so yeah what I love to use for it self
tan or just attend myself which I I
don't know the exact prices but
everything as I said will be linked down
below
that if it's a product that I mentioned
I used the loving tan so I'm going to be
doing a self tanner routine if you guys
want to see that like a sunless tanning
routine where I like to show you what
I'm doing but I do use the loving tan
products I use their mitt I use their
exfoliating mitt when I'm trying to take
off a tan and then I apply this
Lovington product it's a mousse formula
that's my favorite type of self tan and
I haven't streaked on me I've only used
it a couple of times but it's kind of my
go-to when I'm trying to self tan how
does the lashes feel the first day was
it weird
so my eyelash extensions um I got the
super super natural I believe I got the
faux mink lashes so that's what I did
and I got the most natural form of those
and it didn't feel weird it shouldn't
feel like anything is on your eye you
want to make sure that your lash
specialist or whoever's applying your
lashes separates your lashes
individually before applying that's what
my girl told me I really trust her she
had great reviews it doesn't it didn't
feel weird nothing felt different it
literally just felt like lashes didn't
irritate my lashes or anything but you
do have to take a better care of
washes which if I see a question I will
get into and if I don't see that
question then I will just talk about
that
do you prefer spray tan or self tan ad
for self tan because I'm in control
which I like I like being able to know
what shade I want to go and I like being
able to know that I've gotten every spot
on my body so I prefer self tan it's
cheaper I think it's easier I think it's
really convenient but of course the
spray tan is nice it's probably a little
bit quicker it is more expensive but you
do have a professional spraying you
hopefully I think my self tan just looks
pretty natural it doesn't have an orange
effect so I prefer self tanning I don't
absolutely love the process of self
tanning because it is a lot and you do
need somebody to self tan your back I
always get my sister my mom to help me
because you can't do that alone
but I do like self tan because I feel
like when it's starting to come off kind
of just fades away where's the spray tan
you definitely start to get patchy and
splotchy how long does it take to get
your eyelashes done so for me it took
about an hour just because I got the the
most natural type but I think it can
just depend on whoever does your lashes
and what type of lash extension you
choose to get so I bet if you got a
really really big full crazy glamor
dramatic lashes a pair of those I think
that it would probably take about two
hours from me a drink about an hour
maybe an hour 15 minutes just kind of
depends but I guess it really just
depends on who you go to but for me I
got the natural it set and I got it done
in like an hour would you recommend
getting eyelash extensions and are you
gonna still get them done after the
first time this is from the same girl
Anna so I don't know okay this is my
thing
if you've been thinking about eyelash
extensions and you really want to get
them then I say you just go for it if
you have really short lashes and mascara
and falsies don't work for you then I
think eyelash extensions are a really
really great thing I kind of have longer
lashes naturally so I do regret getting
them a little bit it makes everything a
lot easier and of course they look
better than my natural lashes because my
not
lashes weren't as full or long but I
kind of don't take great great care of
my lashes so I don't really know if it
was worth getting them for me and I
don't and I'm hoping that when I get
them removed that my lashes are just as
long and full so I will update you guys
after I get them removed to make sure
there was no damage done to my natural
lashes are you still gonna get them done
after the first time probably not I've
only gotten them done once and I really
want them off now so I know a lot of
people think they're like the greatest
things ever but I do prefer I love
looking like this like waking up and
just looking like I have a pair of Fulci
like not the falsies on it's my favorite
thing but the whole like taking care of
them and then they get tangled in
between each other and all that I just
rather have my neck my natural lashes
back because they were long and thick so
I'm really hoping to stay that way I'm
interested in getting a spray can and
I've heard you saying you get them is it
safe and how do you keep it so I love
spray tans and I love self-tan these are
two things that can easily be removed at
home you don't like them you can just
take an exfoliator and a scrub or aloof
or something and just rub it off and
after a couple days if you keep
scrubbing your skin it will eventually
fade and come off and you will take your
spray tan or self tan off so that's what
I love about it if you messed up if you
think you look too orange in one spot
you can scrub it off it is completely
safe I believe I have never heard that
self-tanning could be self-tanning
or spray tans can be dangerous I know it
gets dangerous when you're in a tanning
bed so I recommend self tanning yourself
or spray tanning but no tanning beds I
don't know what the situation is but
it's not good for you you keep it last
long you use natural products on your
body so instead of Shaving I would use
like a natural shampoo or body wash you
can get at Whole Foods or something that
keeps it lasting longer because I know
that some products in the or some
ingredients in the shaving cream product
can remove yourself tan you have to wait
whatever you're the back of the bottle
of the self tanning thing says or your
spray tan technician it tells you to
wait before you sweat or workout or
anything or get wet shower jump in the
pool whatever you have to wait that
specific amount of time so it lasts
longer has time to
settle into your skin all the normal
basic stuff but you can basically do
whatever you want about how long does
self tan last before it comes off um
self tan for me last about a week or two
depending on how I take care of it if I
am not sweating a lot or working out or
swimming or something then I think it
will last a longer time but since I
usually am working out or I usually am
trying to swim and go to the beach or
something
it lasts me about a week or two which is
not bad because when it starts to get
patchy which is very rare but in some
spots you know get patchy I just kind of
scrub it off and it's gone and then I
can just reapply it and that's my that's
my thing it is a spray tan ever get on
your clothes
just wondering hahaha when you spray tan
and self tan you're supposed to walk
around with really baggy clothes after
I've never had a problem zit staining my
clothes or anything but you're supposed
to wear baggy clothes after you get a
spray tan or self-tanner yourself so
super baggy sleppy isn't a super baggy
shirt or something like that
the last place I went and I spray tan
she told me not to put a bra back on
after so I just kind of wore my big
t-shirt but just wear clothes that you
don't care about that are baggy that's
my don't worry this really nice dress
that you're obsessed with because I
don't know what's gonna happen to you
how often do you get spray tans I don't
get spray tans often I would probably
self tan over spray tan often but if I
have a special event coming up or I'm
just kind of feeling pasty I want to get
a spray tan and I don't want to self-tan
or if I'm out of self-tanner I'll just
call and make myself an appointment it
just kind of really depends on my mood
and how I'm feeling it's never something
I'm planning out unless it's an event
but usually I'll just pick up the phone
and all make an appointment for myself
if I'm feeling on the fairer side okay
so I'm gonna answer three questions that
I get asked a lot and that is number one
for eyelash extensions what do you do
when they come off or they're starting
to do you have to get like a full new
set what happens so you go in and you
get a fill where they fill in the spots
that are missing so that takes a lot
less time and it's cheaper because it's
not a full set all over again
to get them removed I don't recommend
doing them yourself you should go in
back to the place where you got them
done and they will usually have they
should have a process or a lady or
whoever your technician is she should be
able to remove it professionally with
probably something that really takes the
glue down safely because there are
things online that you can find but that
there also is a chance that you're gonna
ruin your natural lashes if you take
them off yourself so yeah definitely go
in and get them professionally removed
or wait till they all fall out naturally
I guess I don't really know what the
proper way to do that is what's a couple
of things that I don't like about lash
extensions I don't like how I have to
take care of them basically to make lash
extensions last a really long time you
shouldn't be putting any mascara on them
you should not be putting false lashes
on top of them you should really you can
put eyeliner but it does damage it does
kind of loosen the glue up you shouldn't
sleep on your face directly just because
that will start to make them rub and the
glue loosen and then they'll fall off
easier so all of those things I love
doing I love doing makeup tutorials I
can't show you how to put false lashes
on now I can't do my mascaras I don't
know it's just been for me being like
somebody active on YouTube that
constantly wants to do like cool
tutorials I feel like it's hard to do
with lash extensions on so I think
that's another reason why it didn't
really work for me personally but that's
basically that it does come with a lot
of maintenance but it does come with a
lot of great things like not having to
wear makeup looking good naturally and
having really pretty full lashes just
for months on end without having to do
anything so that's pretty much it you
guys have any other questions you can
leave them at down below in the comment
section and I will respond to them so
that's basically it for this video thank

tanning down below and I will be sure to
