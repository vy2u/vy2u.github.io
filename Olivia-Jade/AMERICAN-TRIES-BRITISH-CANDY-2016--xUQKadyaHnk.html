yeah without further ado let's get in it
to me trying British candy I also got a
couple like chips ah so let's see how
this goes oh I'm just going to pull out
the first thing I see Walker's fresh
taste guaranteed pickled onion well this
looks disgusting so this isn't much
offend anybody literally I'm just trying
food smells so good I don't know what to
expect
No
um
there's two shower it's like very pickly
if I to rate that one through ten I'm
going to give it a generous three next
I'm going to try these lagoons a round
trees fruit pastilles I have no idea
what these are
I'm going to try this kind of red flavor
mmm tastes like a sour high too although
these are so good I'm going to try a
green one please don't be lime a load
line those are yummy those are super um
true to the flavors like orange is like
orange green kinda jeez a Cline red tea
six strawberry if I had to rate this one
through 10 10 being the best would
probably give this like a 6 let's see
what's next next I'm going to try these
blue hoops
it says there's salt and vinegar and I
like sea salt and vinegar chips so oh my
god I expect them to look like this
they're really little hmm
if I had to rate these little chips one
through ten I would give this like a
nine they're really yummy next I'm going
to try these things called swizzles love
hearts let's see I have never heard of
these before okay I guess they're like
little candies like this and then they
have messages they taste exactly like a
smart deed which is an American candy
really good
mm-hmm okay
boom whoa it got like kind of sour at
the end Oh looks good them if I write
this I would give this a 6 I'm going to
try the maynard's Basset wine gums I
spelled it literally all over my own
entire room
no I'm gonna try the blue I didn't like
that
no that's even worse I don't have to
give the little wine gums like a four
I'm gonna go back to chips more salt and
vinegar Walters again
no Walker sorry they taste like glaze I
just want them to have like a little
more sea salt and vinegar kick I like
them a lot
not out of time one I'm going to try
this thing called a dip dab why did I do
that sherbert dip with a tasty
strawberry flavor lolly okay
whoa strong I could see why people like
that just because it's very sugary like
very candy candy yes
that is not for me I wanted to give that
like God - I'm gonna go with Roundtree's
again fruit gums this is the same one as
the same brand as the fruit pastilles I
think I've got stale ones
honestly they're just pretty average
like their fruit gummies I'm going to
give them like a seven they're not bad
but they're not like exceptional
I hope these don't only tastes like pain
give it a go
oh you suck on them all kind of weird I
don't think I'm gonna finish that one
because if I want it I'll like the chips
a lot that's it for me trying British
candy I hope this didn't offend anybody
you're British I'm not offending you
guys I'm not trying to at least this is
literally me just trying candy I watch
them in American candy video and I saw
people not liking an American candy I
probably would not be offended so I hope
this doesn't hurt anybody's feelings if
I don't like your country's candy but
your trips are so good alright well I'm
gonna go finish on it thank you for

day or night or morning or dawn or dusk
