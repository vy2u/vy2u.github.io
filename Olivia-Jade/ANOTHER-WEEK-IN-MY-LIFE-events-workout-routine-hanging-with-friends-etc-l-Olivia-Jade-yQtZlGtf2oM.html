I'm on my way out of my house right now
because I'm going to attend its lesson
with two of my best friends Lilly and
Charlotte we honestly none of us play
tennis we just thought this would be
kind of funny so we're taking it down of
lesson so I'm gonna go head over there
now you do you look like a pro tennis
player for not playing
I wanted to show you at my at-home
workout routine so what I usually like
to do is start on the treadmill and I
follow this little guide I have I'll
link this down below it's a 30-minute
pyramid intervals and it's supposed to
just burn fat because when you change
intervals or like change speeds and
stuff I guess it kind of helps first
thing I do is I walk at a speed of four
with an incline of 2.5 and I do this for
five minutes and then I follow rest of
it
lovely I like never sweat and lately
I've been sweating and I'm really proud
of myself
what's up guys I don't know this is a
start to a new vlog or if I have other
footage I believe I have other footage
I'm pretty sure but today I wanted to
vlog I guess tonight because I am going
to the peoples ones to watch party

to watch category which is I think it's
like rising influencers or celebrities
or whatever so that was super nice of
them and I'm actually gonna be taking
over people magazines Instagram story

makeup coming in like should be here in
like 10 to 20 minutes and I'm gonna
