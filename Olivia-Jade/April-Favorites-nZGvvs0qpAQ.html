back to my channel today I'm filming my
April favorites without further ado
let's get started into my April
favorites and I hope you guys all enjoy
so starting with skincare I'm first
gonna talk about the simple sensitive
skin experts cleansing micellar water
which cleanses removes makeup and
hydrate so this is a cleanser and a
makeup remover what I really like about
this is I have been ordering the Garnier
one off of Amazon for $45 which in the
UK isn't it like 7 pounds or something
so this I think was $8 I'm pretty sure
it works so well and I've used a lot and
then it lasts a really long time so you
basically just put it on a cotton pad
and then just wipe where your makeup is
on your face or you want to kind of
cleanse and take dirt or makeup or
whatever
off and it says warning avoid getting
into your eyes so probably hurts if you
got it in your eyes but I've gotten like
little parts of my eyes and it doesn't
really feel like anything my oil-free
acne wash pink grapefruit cleanser by
Neutrogena it's back and better than
ever as you probably know or maybe you
don't I don't remember I finished up the
whole thing of this so this is my second
bottle and it lasted me about a year I
want to say and I used it like every day
so maybe action audio maybe like a
little like 9 months and you instantly
clears up my skin and I instantly
cleared up my skin but I didn't drop it
I caught it but I did drop it so there
is another video where I drop something
it smells like artificial grapefruit
which I think smells really nice
actually just kind of smells like real
grapefruit it's a really really amazing
cleanser and I love how it's pink cuz he
just makes you feel a little bit pretty
I also am obsessed with the renewal pink
grapefruit prompt Froemming foaming acne
scrub cleanse which is oil free and this
I thought just until I read that was
Neutrogena but I guess it's pretty well
I love this regardless it has little
beads in it so I kind of feel like it's
exfoliating my skin and really working
and just taking off all the dead skin or
breakouts or just kind of dirt on my
face I use this before I use the
that I was just talking about I have
been loving that little routine I've got
going on my skin is clear for the most
part I have like a little breakouts
around my nose and just like kind of
under my eyes but I feel like that's
just a part of being a teenage girl so
what I use in this day is this blackhead
eliminating daily scrub by Neutrogena I
am obsessed with Neutrogena products I
guess I don't even know why but I feel
like it's just such a trustworthy brand
and it has so much hype on it that it's
just hard to be like oh that seems a
little sketchy that's definitely gonna
break me out feel like Neutrogena has
just made itself such an amazing well
working brand that like anything I see
Neutrogena I just drive at first opposed
to like some of their company I haven't
heard of this is the blackhead
eliminating daily scrub and it
penetrates to eliminate most blackheads
and helps prevent new ones I've noticed
a big difference with this and I've been
using it about a month now I feel like
my blackheads are definite like a little
blackheads around my nose and they're
definitely going down a bunch and I feel
like it's because of this product so and
lastly for skin pear I have been using
Cetaphil moisturizing cream which is
like a massive tub and I've only used
like a little bit you see how there's
just so much left I put this before I
use makeup on to kind of like make my
foundation go on and a lot nicer I use
this before bed I use this in the
daytime to use this morning this just
hydrates your skin perfectly and it
doesn't leave you feeling sticky or
gross it's just a really perfect
moisturizer that just makes your skin
and the dry patches go away it's soaks
in it's really nice I don't want to know
how to describe this but I love it for
makeup I'm starting with my honest Razia
contour kit I have definitely used this
in a tutorial and talked about this many
many times I might have even been in my
favorites video I'm really bad cuz I
don't really like watching my videos
over and over and over again so I don't
really remember what I put in my videos
but this has once again come up in my
life I took a really long break from
using this and now it's just back and
I'm
with it so I of course mostly use I
don't know why I said of course I don't
know why you would know that I'm mostly
using the middle shade which is like a
banana shade to kind of brighten up my
under eyes after I put the concealer on
and I'm also really into this brown
shade right here for a really nice warm
bronzy look and with the middle shade I
love contouring because I feel like it
has a little bit of a gray undertone
which gives a really natural shadow and
it doesn't look like you're putting
bronzer on and trying to make yourself
of cheekbones it just looks super
natural which I love I don't really use
this shade too often but watch next
month I'll be right and once again this
is my favorite next I've definitely
talked about this like months and months
oh I've definitely talked about these
months and months and months ago
it's my NARS radiant creamy concealer
it's probably a favorite like when I
first started my youtube channel I know
it was in my back to school makeup
tutorial which is literally the most
Awkward video on YouTube but there's
some people confuse me and it's for good
memories but it's the NARS radiant
creamy concealer in the colored custard
I took a really long break from this but
I'm totally obsessed with it again it is
so creamy it just blends so nice and
easily under your eyes it gives a really
nice full coverage and the consistency
is pretty much perfect it's the best
concealer I've ever tried and used and I
am so glad I decided to retry this
outfit next is this L'Oreal Paris I
don't know what this is extra intense
liquid pencil eyeliner okay first this
is not liquid but alright it has one
side that's a really deep black and that
has a smudge side I've been trying to
create really smoky look lately
obviously I don't have a smoky look on
today but I've been trying to create
kind of smoky edgy or looks just by
myself lately just practicing practicing
practicing and this little pencil is
amazing and I just recently picked it up
and the smudge side is so nice and it's
so useful this pencil is so easy to
control and then I just smudge it out
and the product smudge is really easily
especially you
a little smudge side it's amazing it
gives a really harsh dark look if you
want it to but that will also give kind
of a really nice light look if you want
it to do that as well do you ever want
just really nice fake lashes and you
don't know how to put on fake lashes but
you don't even have time or if you dude
you don't have time to put on fake
lashes but you look what product is
gonna give me the best lashes ever
it's the Maybelline falsies the falsies
big eye this is the best product I have
ever used in my life for mascara I
literally have like seven backups of
this now because I've just fallen in
love so I figured out a new thing it has
a side for upper lashes inside for lower
lashes and I use the lower lash side
which that's the wrong side it's a
really really really really really
beautiful beautiful okay it's a really
nice thin side and I use this on my top
lashes first which separates your lashes
perfectly and gives them so much length
I have the chills talking about this
that is Soviet that has never happened
to me well I fell that was such an
annoying voice by this literally makes
your lashes just pure perfection and it
looks so natural so if you're not the
type of person that likes clumpy lashes
you just want a product that it makes
your lashes look so so long and so black
and just so separated and so natural it
looks like false eyelashes it's the best
best thing I've ever used I'm getting so
excited um and I just follow up with
like two coats of or maybe just one coat
of the upper lash side to give a little
thickness next is a brush I've been
loving my ELF small stipple brush I've
been using this with a cream blush and
it is amazing it just I love this table
brush I love how they look I love how
they apply it's amazing for foundation
for bronzers is my Sigma for brows I
have two products first is the medium
brow powder it's the Sigma one and I've
heard so much stuff
this on YouTube and it comes with two
colors and I just kind of mix the colors
on my brush and then fill it in I
usually start with the light color
towards the beginning of my brow and
then I used the darker color as I kind
of get to the end and I extend it a
little bit so easy to just kind of like
rub away so I love that I use the gimme
brow by benefit which is just a little
mini size and it is just a little mini
basically a little mini mascara for your
brows it makes them so much darker and
thicker and it just is so so easy to use
it's even amazing if you Damon fill in
your eyebrows and you're just like on
the go and you need to do something
really quick I love it also it sets your
brows so they're not gonna move but it
doesn't feel like sticky or like
rock-hard it's just kind of a perfect
balance lastly for my favorites video
are my a six are these a six my trainer
got them for me they're the eight six
she is the sponsor for a six where she
has something to do with a six so she
got this for me which was so sweet of
her thanks Michelle I am obsessed with
them how fun are these shoes they're so
cool

neon and so pretty I just had the Nike
