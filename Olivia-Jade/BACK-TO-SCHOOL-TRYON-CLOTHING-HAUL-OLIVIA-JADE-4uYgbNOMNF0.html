I have a really exciting video and it's
a back-to-school clothing haul you guys
know I love shopping like a little too
much I might be addicted hopefully you
guys can find some inspiration in the
pieces and I try to keep this pretty
much on the affordable side for those of
you that are paying with your own money
or that you can't go out and spend a lot
of money on back-to-school shopping
because it's not the most important
thing in the world and by the way I just
want to disclaim something really
quickly because I feel like every time I
watch this
nobody fully just claims this and they
don't want anybody to feel bad that
watches videos of back-to-school
shopping that can't go back-to-school
shopping
there is nothing wrong with re wearing
clothes that you already have and there
is nothing wrong if you cannot go back
to school supply shopping you can even
pick inspiration from these pieces that
you already have in your closet so just
want to get that out of the way because
I really don't want to make anybody feel
like shopping is the most important
thing in the world because it's probably
like most important thing in the world
is up here and shopping is like way
below that um so anyway if you guys want
to see what I got
then please keep watching and I hope you
enjoy I am always losing t-shirts so I
did order a lot of t-shirts from brandy
melville if I remember correctly or say
I'm gonna start out with is this thick
choker I'm going to tell you guys the
prices because they're on here but the
price of this is eight dollars I had one
of these from radom elbow before if you
remember in my old videos I wore this
everybody said it looked like I had neck
brace on but doesn't stop me from
getting another one I love thick blood
sugars and I tied mine my old one I know
how to get a new one because I tagged
mine in a knot and it cannot be untied
next from brandy I got this velvet
t-shirt I thought this was really really
cool because it's velvet and I don't
have any velvet clothes so it's just
literally just a plain black tank top
but it's velvet and it's so soft I also
got this cute t-shirt heavy uniform so I
don't I'm not really familiar with like
dress codes and stuff but I'm pretty
sure you cannot just wear this to school
but the reason I got like a bunch of
these all should you'll be able to see
in a few but like shirts like this is be
I want to put them over white t-shirts I
think that would be so cute
and like boyfriend jeans or something so
I'm going to show you in the Tryon
obviously how I style that but I'm going
to hide wear this I just got this like
plain black shirt and it has like this
detailing at the front like this lace
detail and then it just goes like all
the way down but I think I expected this
to be shorter so we'll see we'll make it
work I also got this shirt which I am
obsessed with and this is definitely
dress code appropriate it's 21 dollars
but it's so cute it's just this plain
yellow t-shirt and it says honey on the
corner I just really really like this
color and I just love I know that I love
the fit of this shirt because I have
other church already melville like this
and it is so soft I love this color I
think it's just really really cute and
that's why I got it clearly also from
brandy I got this extremely soft sweat
shirt sweater situation it's actually a
lot thinner but this is for me I'm
allowed to wear like grey black or white
sweat shirts to school so this is what
I'm going to put over my uniform next
from brain level I got these adorable
blush shorts I really want the silk ones
but they're always out of stock so these
ones are just little white ones I sleep
in these but I thought I would show it
anyway because they're soft like so soft
and I got this awhile that's why I don't
have the price tags on it but you know
per usual I try and link everything down
below I also have these striped little
pj shorts but you could also style these
with just like a white shirt or
something I just don't I don't ever wear
silky shorts but like out in public but
you know it's very possible then I also
I think these are dress code because
they are like they're not short they
cover your butt fully and they're like
you could definitely wear these out I'm
obsessed with these they're from Brandi
also and there's just like this
checkered print
I think they fit really really nicely
also for Brandi I'm just going to
automatically try this one on because it
is kind of hard to explain but it's just
this blush t-shirt and then it ties in
the front and since this is a little bit
low-cut you're definitely going to have
a pair a t-shirt under this I usually
just wear a really little white tank top
under it with like thin straps but yeah
that's what I normally do with that I
don't I can't just wear like a bralette
even though that's what I did in the
chai on I also got this black t-shirt
this is just a plain black a little
spaghetti strap so I think spaghetti
shops aren't just good but I guess you
could throw a sweater on and then the
back has a little tie and if you guys
know my channel already and watch my
videos I put the white version of this
shirt in my back-to-school outfit ideas
I can have that link down below if you
haven't seen it but yeah I was so
obsessed with the white one that I went
to thank all at one because I wore the
white one probably four days in a row
wanna move on to Urban Outfitters really
quickly and I only got two things and
their little bra let's not trying this
on but it's just this black rola and
I've always needed a bra left that in
the back goes instead of two straps
right down your back it kind of has that
middle piece so in shirts that are fit
like that but you can't wear a bra like
that with a little bra let with this
type of bag I thought a literally one in
English but I think you understand what
I'm saying and I also got another little
bra and this one's a little bit lazier
this is just really pretty and I don't
think it fits me that well it might be a
tiny small but okay because under your
shirt anyway and also I just have kind
of like a random piece I got these shoes
they're from bu thank you I don't really
know how to pronounce that how do you
say that word are just really cool black
sneakers and they have a little platform
for the tiny girls like me out there I
always need a little platform in my shoe
if I can because I don't like wearing
heels and I don't like wearing heeled
boots because I'm all about the comfort
but I also hate being so short next to
everybody and I'm not so short on 5'4
which I guess is tiny so having like a
platform is so key for me and lastly
what I'm going to finish off the hall
with I know this wasn't
giant but it also wasn't small and most
of it was Brittany Melville so I'm sorry
for not oh by the way of lipstick there
so I'm sorry for not like branching out
to a bunch of different stores but the
last I want to finish off with are some
shorts jean shorts from Topshop they're
the Moto girlfriend in a size 4 and USA
4 and it's a size 8 and like your butt
it's just like they're just cute jean
shorts um and I like the length of them
because they cover my butt that is it
