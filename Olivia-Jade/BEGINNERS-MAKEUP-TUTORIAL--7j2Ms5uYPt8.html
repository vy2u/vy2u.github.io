my channel today I'm filming a beginners
makeup tutorial and this is going to be
super quick super easy not a lot goes
into this makeup tutorial is honestly
for the beginning of beginners it's just
the most simple easiest but looks like
you tried a little put some effort into
it you don't have to be super skilled
with makeup or anything like that if you
guys you want to see this beginners make
material then just keep watching and I
hope you enjoy I'm just going to start
with base makeup I'm starting with the
instant age rewind concealer by
Maybelline and I'm just placing this
under two triangles under underneath our
eyes it goes to make a little triangle
I'm sorry I realized I don't have a beer
companies micronus and your kids why not
breathing you're doing this and triangle
says to highlight your eyes a little bit
and it also conceals and gives a nice
full coverage I'm just buying South with
my ring finger and I'm using my phone as
I'm here so sorry
hope your beginner you may also use
foundation there's nothing that you're a
beginner at makeup you can't use I'm
just trying to use stuff that is super
easy and affordable and just very
accessible to you guys especially if you
are beginner in makeup so I started with
the concealer but you do feel like your
skin needs a bit more coverage you can
put your concealer wherever you think it
needs that and if you just feel a lot
more confident wearing a full face of
foundation you guys can look at some of
my other videos where I just put
foundation on in the start and that's
also what I would give advice to my
beginner on how to do so I make no sense
after that I'm just going to set the
concealer this is super easy if you're a
beginner I would definitely recommend a
colorless base powder or a translucent
powder which is the same thing and it's
just a white powder the reason for this
is it's such a makeup and it will last a
lot longer but if you use a powder that
has color to it it will make your makeup
look a little bit more caked on so I
just dip your brush in there and then
just kind of go under where I put my
concealer
next I'm just going to go in the flush
I'm not going to go over on zaroor
contouring just because that is a little
bit more complicated and it's just an
extra stuff that isn't necessarily
necessary so we're just going to use a
light pink blush which gives some flush
and light back into our faces after we
put concealer because right now we just
kind of look like nothing too exciting
I'm using this Bobbi Brown blush in the
color nude pink and the reason I like
this for a beginner blush is because
it's matte so it's easy to work with it
looks more natural and also it doesn't
have that much pigment right away like
one dab it's not like an overwhelming
around blush it's easy to start out with
a little bit and then just keep going on
instead of just going to ban and then
like look like a clown you know and then
what I like to do is start at the top of
my cheekbone and just work my way down a
little concealer a little setting powder
and blush you're completely done with
your face there's nothing else you have
to worry about this is a really nice
subtle everyday look as well and it's
not too heavy or looks like you're
wearing a ton of makeup and it looks
very natural and super easy to
accomplish also if you're a beginner I
suggest starting with a concealer that
is liquid not as much as like a chalky
concealer just cuz I feel like chalky
concealers I'm harder to blend out they
look a little less not so if you're done
with your face you are going to be doing
some eye shadow this might scare you if
you are a beginner but I suggest using a
cream eyeshadow where it's so easy to
apply this is the Maybelline New York
color tattoo 24-hour metal eye studio i
have the shade barely branded which is
just a light champagne so what I'm going
to do is I just take it on my finger
just on my ring finger and I
I'm going to use my phone nests here and
I just put this all over my eyelid after
you're done with that it looks really
natural it's super easy to do because
it's a cream so it's not like you have
to do a lot of blending I just put this
all over my eyelid I didn't put it
anywhere higher I literally just put it
from where you have that little crease
down to your lashline gonna skip the
whole eyeliner part eyeliner is so hard
to use and there are different eyeliners
that are easier to use than others if
you're a beginner I suggest a liquid
eyeliner or if you're not a beginner
just liquid in my opinion so much easier
to use if you guys want to put an
eyeliner feel free to do that now I'm
just going to skip straight to mascara
for my girls that don't have to use
eyeliner because let me tell you it is
hard and it took me a long time to get
good at eyeliner which I'm still not
even a kid so I make so many mistakes
but you just start from as close to your
lash line as possible and then just
wiggle it out
you can also put the mascara on your
bottom lashes if you'd like but I'm just
going to keep it on the top so after
you're done with mascara you're going to
finish off with the lipstick and lip
gloss thing a combination I used in my
other video and I'm obsessed with it
it's the elf's wink pink I started the
top and I basically just outline where
my lips have some shape to them I out
like that and then I just do the bottom
I go move my god and then I just kind of
fill in any spots so I start with
outlining the top using the laura
mercier one and a fair baby and I'm just
going to go really light pink it's
really pretty and all over it's fast the
finished look whoa for all my beginners
I hope you guys all enjoyed this video
