lighting just went down that 200,000
people would end up subscribing to me
it's so surreal so I can't thank you
guys enough
like seriously from the bottom my heart
I truly could not be more grateful today
as you guys know if you follow my you
guys follow my snapchat or Twitter I
have been in the process the Sun is back
up the process of creating a beauty room
um in my house so that's what's
happening right now I have way too much
makeup for a 16 year old child and I
know this and compared to when I was
putting it away it's not nearly as much
as some other youtubers have um but it
is a lot for 16 years of being on this
planet and I wanted to do this video
today to kind of like have this kind of
be like moving into my beauty room
series so this is like episode 1 I'm
sorry for the long intro I just feel
like I have to cover all these points
and this is like episode 1 of moving
into my beauty room with me and it is
not finished I'm still installing a
carpet because the echo Superbad and all
of that kind of situation but I just
wanted to film this video for you guys
so you guys can see the process because
I know a lot of people can't wait any
longer so I'm going to go through my
makeup a little bit show you the
furniture that's in there and then each
step when they're installing the carpet
I'm going to film that and then when
that's done when I get more makeup and
then at the end of this whole series
that I'm going to do at the very end
many little videos will be in this
series it might just be two it might be
through my before whenever I'm all done
anytime I'm working on my beauty room I
will film it though and I don't know how
long that these little videos will be
but also I'm going to do so if you guys
want to see what's in my beauty room
let's go come along with me and this is
the very first episode to moving into my
beauty room and if you guys have any
suggestions for storage um anything like
that it's super echoey right now that's
why I'm putting down a carpet but anyway
enough of this long intro let's go into
my fear when we first walk in I opened
my door and this is the layover sorry
for the really big mess I'm still
organizing yeah that explains it okay
let's continue
and then my door so this is where I'm
going to be filming for the most part
I'm going to put a chair there and then
have my lights going this way so this is
basically the angle you guys will be
seeing in my new video that's a little
sneak peek of my background um so I have
this mirror I got from the Container
Store and then I'm going to keep all my
Kylie lip kits that I accumulate over
the orders in this little thing I don't
know I'm going to stir all this and then
this will all be taken out this is just
extra storage these are from the
Container Store they just open like that
right below there I have a little trash
can from The Container Store as well and
I'm going to get a chair there as I was
saying I then um okay by the way this is
a little hack for a corner desk
I got a large tabletop from Ikea and
then I got a small tabletop from Ikea
and I just got these IKEA like stands
when I do like my final you think
everything will be linked down below but
for now I'm just showing you and then I
got the Alex 5 drawer I think it is one
two three four five yeah 5 joy and I
don't have anything in here yet I still
have to fill this part of the room up I
have to Alex 9 drawers and at the top of
them I have all my makeup brushes so
this is crazy I know
but basically I got these from the
Container Store and they weren't cups
for some reason it was strangely hard to
find acrylic cups so they were actually
little jars from the Container Store
and they had these little lids on them
before like they were just little jars
like that before I took them off and
made them at brush holders um so I've
separated all my brushes and then I have
one for my blenders and then we go into
the drawers I'm not going to like go
into every single product because if you
guys want a makeup collection video I
will do that separately just let me know
by thumb zhing this up but I think for
this part I'm going to get my tripod but
I'm going to start with
the first to drawer so you can get like
a little overlay I don't know if I'm
entirely happy with how I'm storing
everything yet but right here I have
like brows and primaries I primers
primers I um so that's an outdoor and
then I just have like like mists and
setting sprays and priming and lotions
and just like a little benefit remover
and then I also in the back right there
I have tools so I have last colors nail
clippers scissors and then right here I
have all chopsticks so this is kind of
like the prepare drawer I guess you
could call it these two drawers um let's
start with this guy here I have all my
powders and concealers so I don't have
many powders I thought I had more but I
guess I don't so I could just fit them
in this little container and then it
just kind of fits perfectly right in my
drawer and then I also have this little
concealer situation happening so I kind
of just lined up on my concealers I have
like my NARS Negley Maybelline Rimmel
naked Mac and then just some random ones
over here and then I have just a bunch
of random powders that I'm not even
going to get into right here I have
pencil liners liquid liners and gel
liners and then back here I have all my
mascaras I'm going to need a new way to
organize my mascaras because I have too
many crammed in that but that's bad but
then when we open these two drawers I
have my foundations and BB creams and
then over here I have like my single pot
shadows some shadow sticks and glitter
anything glitter really so then the next
row right here I have all my makeup
palettes so I don't know if this is a
good way to organize it I think it's
okay um so yeah you guys once again if
you want to makeup collection just gums
this video up leave me a comment and I
will
I do that but as of now I'm just showing
you the overview and then for this I
have my raw illuminators okay so I have
some illuminators in here I have all my
two-faced bronzers I have some Mac
highlights and some more Bobby Brown
highlights and then just like some other
random illuminators just a sneak peak
this is beautiful isn't it when we go
into the next drawer because that has to
do with it
sorry let me shut this let me go into
this drawer I have some cream bronzing
and highlight and then just more powders
that were bigger or just don't really
fit in the drawer above more makeup
palettes so I've decided to keep my
bigger palettes my thicker chunkier ones
that just don't have a place in the
drawer above in here so my morphe
palette and this is my below drawer I
love this I got this little container at
the Container Store with this side as
you can see I'm opening the next one but
this drawer is completely emptied these
there's three empty ones so I don't know
what I'm going to do but when I get more
makeup over time it'll be good to have
that extra storage I have all my lash
equipment I guess you could call it um
everything you need for lashes okay so
for this drawer I have all my liquid
lipsticks glosses and my Too Faced
melted liquid lipsticks the next drawer
I just have these little lipstick
containers right there that I got from
the Container Store and I have some more
glosses lipsticks and all that good
crazy stuff a bunch of lipsticks right
on the far side and then close to us the
camera I have a bunch of lip liners and
that is my Alex knife drawers both of em
um so that's it for like the beauty part
and then I'm going to turn you around
and show you my little office editing
space I have this desk from Ikea
once again when I do the big video when
it's all said and done the whole room is
finished
we go over it guys this is the beginning
stages but I have this a marbled
notebook that I got from The Container
Store and these fake flowers from
Michael's and then I also got that
little square pop from Michael's as well
it's just just square glass pot and I
really loved it and then I also got
these this is called the bessemer's desk
right here and it just has this drawer
space and I'm also getting a big desktop
to go right there so I can do all my
editing down here I'm really excited
about it because it's honestly just
becoming a studio for what I love doing
and that's like the coolest thing okay
you saw the desk and now I'm turning you
over here this is just a bathroom if you
guys want to see that I guess I'll show
it in another video I don't really know
if you care to see a bathroom but then I
have these little closets um interesting
right Wheatly playing closet it is
perfect to just shrink my lights up when
I'm done filming they just put them in
here so when I am done filming this room
becomes an actual room again and it
doesn't just look super cluttered with
the lights everywhere so I'm excited I
have a place to store those so and
that's basically that so real exciting I
know and all these drawers are
completely empty they're just drawers
and small storage and I have yet to
decide what I'm gonna do with those if
you are still watching you have made it
to the end of this video that concludes
it for this video once again it is
probably super echo in here there is
concrete floors right now carpet is
being installed next week and I will
vlog that process and leave clever names
for what this series should it be called
moving eternity to room I don't know
Richard copious so I love you guys I
hope you guys enjoy this video I hope
this Wednesday's video just did
appoint you too much and the system
should be requested so I think this is
fun I these are my favorite videos to
watch and I will catch you guys on
Sunday yeah bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
