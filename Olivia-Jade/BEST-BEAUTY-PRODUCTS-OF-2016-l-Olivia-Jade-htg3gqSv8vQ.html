so excited for today's video I've been
like non-stop tweeting about it and snap
chatting and everything so today's video
as you can tell by the title is my
favorite products of 2016 I have a lot
to get through so I'm not going to keep
the interest super long but I will have
direct links to everything down below
for you guys with the names and
everything in the order I show them so
these have been kind of like the best of
beauty for 2016 and if you want to see
what I personally have been loving then
just keep watching
also deepest apologies for the
background it's kind of dark I don't
know if it's messy and I just I'm trying
I'm not feeling my best right now I'm
feeling a little sick so try to get
through that oh my god and also happy
2017 I almost forgot to say this video
is my first video of 2017 I have a
feeling it's going to be a good year so
happy 2017 let me know what your new
year's resolution is down below I need
some inspiration but I'm just going to
go ahead and get into this video so if
you guys want to see what I've been
loving then just keep watching and I
have it all in order on my phone so yes
let's start with something that is no
surprise to anyone that I'm putting this
video I bet all of you can guess what it
is if you watch a lot of my videos where
is it ba ba ba ba I had to include this
I won't talk too long because you can
basically watch any makeup video and I
talked about this it's it cosmetics your
skin but better CC plus cream I love
this I'm so sorry I keep I put this in
almost every video on people are
probably getting really annoyed by now
but it just gives you like a really nice
hydrated glowy finish and it's super
natural which is personally what I love
can bold it up to full coverage and you
can kind of share it out with a beauty
wonders so if you use a brush like a
kabuki brush it can be really full
coverage and then a Beauty Blender it
will make it a little bit more natural I
like the natural look but whatever you
guys want it's really really really
amazing though and it doesn't feel like
things on your face which is ideal so
surprise again but I have to include
these in at my 2016 favorites because I
would die without this this is the Mario
Badescu with skincare facial spray with
aloe herbs and rose water this is
amazing
this is the most hydrating product ever
I'm going to be I'm not going to sit
here and say I noticed a huge change in
my skin but the blah blah but I do
notice that it's not like it prevents
acne or anything like that but it keeps
a lot of hydration in my face so it just
makes me feel really awake and alive and
super super hydrated which is really
important to me because when I feel like
like I'm cracking or like I'm dry it's
the worst so this has been such a saver
for that and it provides like
rejuvenation for your skin and also I
love using this before makeup makeup
settles into this so so well and after
makeup just so like my skin looks normal
oh my god I forgot to do my eyebrows for
this video well so next I'm going to
talk about two brushes and they are both
the lending brushes then I don't know if
I would have gotten through 27 2016
without these this is my Sigma tapered
blending e-40 brush this is just this
fluffy one here and then the Sigma
blending e to five brush which I talked
about I believe in a favorites video
before the very dirty I need to clean
them but these are just wonderful
blending brushes especially if you're a
beginner I know they are a little bit
expensive since they are from Sigma but
I really recommend these are all I need
to do a really bomb at I look so this
crease one is super fluffy so it trying
to kind of just get everywhere it's
perfect for a transition and this is
also perfect if you just kind of want to
get in the crease a little bit more it's
so gorgeous and yeah both these brushes
work really well so I thought I'd throw
it in oh my god what everybody's been
asking lately is how the hell do I self
tan myself so this is definitely been a
favorite this is my loving tan and
deluxe bronzing mousse this is a two
hour Express I actually prefer the just
the normal six hour one but this bottle
looked like the cleanest since I use the
six hour ones all the time you're like
I'm
so I bought it to the pretty one but I
use the tanning mitt with this you have
to have a good tanning mitt I believe
loving Tana has hooked it up for you
guys so if you use the code Olivia you
get a free tanning mitt with your
purchase but test that out let me know
if you decide I hope to use that I don't
think I'd benefit from that at all but
if you guys benefit than I benefit just
gives you like a really natural olive
tan I actually put this on and it's
still wet right now
oh it dries really fast but like it's a
fresh tan is on me right now no you can
tell but I need to wash this off in like
six hours and it just gives a really
even tan I'm going to do a self tanning
routine soon but I love this product
next skin care this was in my skin care
routine I will link that video down
below because it's probably one of the
most requested videos I still get even
though it's up on my channel so my top
two skincare products are a little bit
more expensive but it's Lancer skincare
and polish and the cleanse and it's just
the Polish is an exfoliator so it really
deep cleans and makes your face feel
like an extra layer has been taken off
and just really gets in there and it
also removes makeup and the method
cleanse is just a cleanser so it's a
soft cleanser that you have all over
your face I do this every morning and
night I definitely do the cleanse every
morning and night sometimes they won't
use my polish every morning just because
it's a deep cleanse and I don't need
that every morning but I definitely use
it every night it's been keeping my skin
it's super clear so I'm pretty much
obsessed okay next I want to talk about
a perfume shush next I want to talk
about perfume this is the Chanel number
5 perfume this smells it's perfect
reminds me of my mom I mean first the
bottle is just like the classiest thing
you've ever seen and it's just like a
really girly it just smells amazing and
I thought I'd throw it in because I've
been using this so much for 2016 it's my
go-to I'm always reaching for it I
really don't know what I would do
without this I use this perfume every
time I'm going out when I'm going to a
lunch anything it's like a very natural
refreshing smell so it's not something
where you put it on in your life like
super overwhelmed it's just super super
I just smells natural I can't explain
it's me
next up I want to talk about my Laura
Mercier translucent powder I'm sure in
this video you're gonna or in these
types of videos the 2016 beauty
favorites you're going to see a lot of
this because everyone has raved about
this on YouTube this year and it really
is such a great powder it just makes
your makeup last all day long and it's
not like drying which is the biggest
thing for a translucent powder I love
using a damp Beauty Blender and dipping
this in and then setting my makeup right
away I don't only like baking because it
doesn't look that natural so I'm not
really about that but I love setting my
makeup with this it's so beautiful and I
swear it does not make you feel dry
which is probably the most important
thing for a lot of people when
purchasing a powder um but it doesn't
make your makeup last all day oh I need
to talk about this I recently found this
product just last month I want to say
it's the Mac extra dimension skin finish
and beaming blush again I feel like a
lot of these products I'm talking about
have been in favorites this past couple
months but this video was still very
requested so it's just this really
gorgeous highlighter and what I love
about this is it's kind of natural so
when you put it on it's not like this
dark highlight as I always say it's just
kind of more of an inner glow um I need
a new vocabulary I know but I love this
so much it just makes you look like
you're glowing from within again I know
I say that all the time but I'm telling
you this product really does the job I'm
out of this product because I was so
obsessed with it in 2016 this is a
Smashbox photo finish primer water and
I'm not going to say that I've noticed a
huge difference with it making my makeup
last a long time because I never notice
that with primers I mean I'm sure they
do something hence why they were
invented and hence why everyone uses
them um and definitely when I don't use
a primer I noticed something I just I
don't know I'd never pay attention like
oh this primer made my skin or my makeup
last all day but I did notice this
provided like an insane amount of
hydration I would spray this on my face
every single time before I makeup and I
would also finish my makeup with this
and it just makes your like when you're
done with makeup the powder that was on
your face it just kind of presses it
into your skin so it's a lot more
natural and then the makeup if you spray
this on before it makes it kind of
really natural and cream products over
this is stunning so that's been my
favorite way
a to pry my skin and it's so fast and
easy so I need to get more because I'm
literally out oh I need to talk about
this this product has been amazing this
is the Too Faced Born This Way concealer
I really love the foundation - it's not
in this video but I do love the
foundation and I have it in the shade
light and sometimes a medium when I
faked and but um it's just really
blendable it gives good coverage and
it's super lightweight so it doesn't
look like you're taking up under your
eyes which in my opinion is the worst
look ever I really don't like when I see
people having like super intense creases
or anything like that and what I love
about this is you don't crease its
blendable it's easy to blend out it's
lightweight and it's really beautiful
and natural and it also can be full
coverage so big check love this you
definitely should try it out oh I need
to talk about this
you guys know cream products have
literally been my go to this whole year
basically I love cream contouring and I
love cream highlighting so I want to
talk about this benefit Watts up
highlighter in yea there's no shade I
think there's just one it's just a soft
focus highlighter for the face it says
but what I love about this is not just
apply it and then plunge it out with my
finger and the finger blends this out
beautifully it just looks really natural
and it's creamy it doesn't look cakey or
like that flaky powder it just looks
actual like it looks actually like your
skin and using this with your whole face
of cream products and then just like
setting the places where you need to set
look stunning so you definitely show you
guys how to do that if you want but I
love this product oh my gosh I've never
talked about this on my channel I don't
think maybe I have oh I have I think
eight years ago this stuff has come into
my life again and it's amazing this is
the l'oreal smooth velour smoothing
lotion texture expert i don't know just
product after i get out of the shower I
put this in my hair before I'm gonna
blow dry it with a blow dryer obviously
it makes your hair so silky like this is
insane to me I always use this before I
blow dry my hair because it's that's
what it's meant for but it makes your
hair like so soft softer than you've
ever ever ever felt
it's L'Oreal it's from the drugstore
seriously recommend it I'll link it down
below it's amazing amazing amazing I
have to try it definitely recommend let
me know if you try it and how it works
for you because I'm obsessed oh I know I
also really need to talk about this
chubby stick from Clinique in curvy
contour now I was using this wrong in
the beginning so I wasn't getting the
full potential out of this product I
wasn't loving it when I first got it
because I was like something's off
something's it's not blending as I hope
this product literally has everything to
do with the thing you blend it out with
so you need a brush a Beauty Blender did
not do this for me I could not blend
this out with a Beauty Blender you need
a good kind of dense fluffy brush to
blend this out and it's gorgeous it
gives a really nice contour but it's
also kind of that perfect chocolatey
Brown that's kind of more on the warm
tone side so it gives a really nice
bronzed glow which we know we love I
love using this and the product just
talked about the benefit Watts up
highlighter stick together because it's
pretty perfect and you guys have heard
me talk about that so I'm going to keep
it too long but love I'm going through
this I'm probably just going to say the
names really quick and that's going to
be that because you guys know I talk
about this so much but I've been having
I have to put this in my 2016 all-time
favorites because it's the clear brow
gel by honest Razia and not honest Razia
Beverly Hills brow is this is all I use
on my brows I don't switch it up these
products are amazing they're easy to use
then make your brows last and 30c to use
so why the hell not next up I have my
Too Faced hangover primer I've used this
for so long
first of all the smell is gorgeous it
smells like coconuts took a really
tropical scent and again as I said
before I really don't pay attention to
primers if they make your makeup stay
all day because I just don't but this if
you have dry skin and you need a really
hydrating primer I seriously recommend
this this is the most hydrating primer
ever
it has coconut water infused in it I
believe and it just makes your skin it
feels so replenished it's so so amazing
I literally don't have anything bad to
say about it and it smells bomb I have
to talk about this soft skin is
everything to me and I'm almost out of
this is the beauty counter sugar body
scrub oh it smells so good it kind of
smells like lemons
but it's amazing it smells good and you
take this it's like a sugar scrub and it
feels kind of that sandy texture like a
really rough sand and you rub it all
over your legs and your body or wherever
you shave and it literally makes your
skin feel so smooth this smooth is my
skin has ever felt is when I use this
stuff I can't even explain it it works
better than any scrub for me too it's
just a really deep exfoliation I've got
a couple more products I feel like I've
gone through this video pretty quick so
that's great I next want to talk about
my favorite false lashes these are the
kiss and natural flourish blooming lash
in camellias and these are the most
natural fluttery lashes I've ever seen
in my lifetime but I just want to
recommend these for a really great lash
that's super inexpensive because these
are so cheap I believe and they're
really gorgeous this style camellias is
so fluttery and perfect I also have
tulip here if you're into more like
thick volume for your lash
this is the perfect amount for me so I
love these lashes lastly to finish off
my 2016 favorites I have to throw in my
favorite makeup palette this is the
morphe 35o you guys know I use this so
so much in my live streams and whatever
I'm getting ready and anything like that
this polishes gorgeous it's affordable
and the colors are stunning and you guys
know everyone always I keep saying you
guys know what maybe you don't know and
my foots asleep
everybody always gets mad at me on here
because I'm always doing really warm
toned looks and everybody wants me to
switch it up which maybe in 2017 I will
but this palette is just kind of like my
palette this is everything I'd ever want
on my eyes cuz I feel really comfortable
playing around with warm tones so yeah
send morphe 35o believe it's like $22 or
something pretty good so yeah that is it
for my 2016 best of beauty at favorites
