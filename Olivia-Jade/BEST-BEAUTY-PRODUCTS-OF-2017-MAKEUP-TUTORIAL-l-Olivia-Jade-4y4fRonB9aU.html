my youtube channel in today's video I am
doing my 2017 makeup favorites in a
tutorial so everything i've used on my
face today has been my holy grail for
the whole entire year which is crazy
happy 2018 by the way I am so excited
for this year and to take on these crazy
video ideas and adventures with you guys
and I'm so open to hearing your new
requests for videos I want to
incorporate a lot more Fitness into my
channel this year and bring back some
class I could make tutorials like I used
to do so I'm very excited also outfits
and fashion and all that good stuff but
today this is the look I came up with it
is a really stunning look with amazing
products I swear by every single product
I use I don't feel cakey I don't look
cakey it's super lightweight but also
very full coverage and glam so I hope
you guys enjoyed this video don't forget
to click that subscribe button and turn
on my post notifications and let's get
started okay so the first thing I want
to talk about are a few skincare
products just because I feel like that's
so important it makes your makeup
literally entire game changer it makes
all the difference per makeup so
moisturize are my favorite moisturizer
has been this dior snow brightening or
finding moist cloud cream this is a
little bit expensive I'm really sorry
I've just been obsessive it it's been my
favorite from moisturizer I feel like my
skin looks so healthy when I put it on I
also really loved the it cosmetics your
skin but better correcting cream I think
that's what it's called I really like
that one and also the origins which
Tizer to some other alternatives but
this one is just with my favorite so I
just take the Jenners matte apply this
all over my face and also down my neck
this smells so yummy it's like Laura Lee
in front after I just popped back I'm a
mess
I also burned my face on a curling iron
so wish me luck just in my 2018
endeavors I also love moisturizing up my
lips this one is my favorite it's the
Palmer's cocoa butter formula
swivel stick I'm obsessed with this I my
lips are really dry right now so just
put that on I also put this on my burn
because it has vitamin E so I also just
want to mention this I'm not gonna put
this on right now because I'm not going
out in the Sun but this is my favorite
sunscreen it's the glossier invisible
shield daily sunscreen I put this on
every single morning it's so important
to wear sunscreen
so this one's super light it's colorless
it feels really lightweight on the skin
it doesn't have like a strong scent at
all so now the fats out of the way let's
start with foundation I was tossed up
between two products to share with you
guys for my 2017 beauty favorites
because this is like my go-to must-haves
foundation so it was a really hard
choice because there are so many great
foundations on the market I came down to
this the Too Faced Born This Way I have
two shades because I don't really know
what shades gonna match my neck right
now and I also was torn between
mentioning my Laura Mercier tinted
moisturizer because this is usually what
I wear on like an everyday basis but if
we're going like full makeup like an
actual maker tutorial I do wear my Too
Faced Born This Way when I'm going out
to like parties or to events or whatever
well actually if I don't do my makeup
for events then usually makeup artists
use something else but if I'm doing my
own makeup these are my go-to
I love applying this with a brush
something like this this is my Sephora
collection Pro flawless airbrush brush
and I just like to apply the foundation
that should match my neck straight to my
face too just because it's a little
lighter kind of just mix those together
to get my perfect shade those were the
shades natural beige and warm beige I
believe yeah and then I just take this
brush and I kind of stipple it in and
then after I'm done blending that out I
go in with a sponge I will show you guys
my favorite one after and I make sure it
looks super even and just flawless like
you're an airbrush queen so let's just
blend this out by the way at the moment
nothing is covering this burn like she
is here to make an entrance ever got to
do primer okay well I had it here my
favorite is the Marc Jacobs invisible
under cover perfecting coconut face
primer but honestly I moisturize err is
so nice I don't even really need primer
so after I look a little scary I just
take this morphe sponge and I love that
I had like this little flat side to it
and a pointed side it's my favorite and
I just topped this off and go over
by the way you guys this foundation
doesn't feel heavy it's so lightweight
and it covers up so beautifully and it
doesn't look cakey at all okay so now
for it concealer I use the Tarte shape
tape I'm sure you guys could I guess
that I like to take the light neutral
shade and apply this under my thighs and
this goes kind of a long way pretty
thick so I do that to brighten up the
areas this is like more of if I'm going
like kinda not like super full glam but
pretty full glam you know this is
definitely not an everyday type of look
and then I just go in with that medium
kind of shade and cover you spot need
some extra TLC back in with a Beauty
Blender I just pounce listen you don't
want to like rub this you don't want to
smear it you're gonna take your
foundation off so if you just do a
little bounce that's ideal maybe I do
what my undereyes last make sure to get
in these little nose crevices and then I
go like this
to this eye and I go back and do it to
this eye and I kind of just switch back
and forth between both eyes so the
product is evenly distributed I learned
this from a beautiful beauty guru named
Alyssa Ashley who my sister just got me
obsessed with she's gorgeous her skin is
always looking amazing so
and then when you get to the cheeks you
want it to be seamless so I just kind of
like Pat downwards and then I go in
right away and set that down with powder
this is my Laura Mercier translucent
powder I feel like you knew this was
gonna be the powder I chose I've been
using this one all year so I blend out
my creases you can set that down right
away and I just do like my smile lines
around the mouth and I let that sit
there for a quick second and then I move
on to browser so this bronzer is my
favorite it's the Chanel Soleil tan de
Chanel bronzer it's like this massive
cream bronzer if you guys don't want to
drop this crazy amount of money that
this is I also really like the milk
bronzer so I will link down below but
this is my favorite of the year I like
to apply this with a little stippling
brush and I just swirl my brush in there
and I really start to just sculpt the
cheekbones out and really bronze them I
try and do like a little line and then
when you smile see that that's where I'm
like kind of carving out and making like
a dark shadow because that really brings
out my cheekbones and lifts the month
and then I just bring it up to bronze a
little bit
right after that I like to go in with a
cream highlighter I was really torn
between putting this highlighter that
I'm about to talk about and my benefit
walks out because they are literally
both my obsession you can't go wrong
with either but this one I've been using
a ton this last month it's the milk
makeup highlighter and the shake lit
it's stunning so I am just going to take
that on the same it's stippling brush
and apply this right to the cheekbones I
really like it because it's kind of like
you're glowing from within so next I'm
going in with this Too Faced Sun bunny
natural bronzer it has two tones it's
stunning it gives a lot of warmth to the
skin and I like going in with like a
huge brush this one is Real Techniques
in number 100 it's like a part of their
gold whatever collection and I really
just like kind of go for it like really
bronzed up the skin you guys know I'm
all about the glow bronze warm tones so
and then before we go any further let's
fix my hair so before we go any further
I'm gonna wipe away the under eyes I'm
just taking the same brush I used for my
foundation and really lightly sweeping
that away kind of almost pushing it into
the skin and then blending cool so now
for one of my favorite parts highlighter
which I'm sure you guys already knew
it's my favorite part so this one has
been stunning and I've been obsessed
with it it's the Oprah highlighter in
the shade Rodeo Drive this is like if
you want to pop and glow and just like
wow like wow the crowd so before I do
highlighter I always like to spray my
face this is my favorite right now it's
the morphine prep and scent makeup
setting spray it just has like the most
fine mist so it's not like splotches of
wetness come out it's like just one like
gradient effect
if that makes any sense so I love that
smells good so refreshing so I just
spray that on my face to go in with this
Oprah highlighter and I like to do this
on a fan brush if I do this on like a
dense tapered brush or something that
doesn't have like fine bristles it's a
little bit too much pigment so I like
doing out something like a little bit
finer like a fan brush just dip the tip
in the only thing is there's fallout so
be careful and then I mean hello I just
highlight the tops of my cheeks and then
I like to take my finger and I do the
tip of my nose I bring this a little bit
higher than the actual tip so it kind of
lifts my nose up and then it's gone with
my Beauty Blender or my morphe sponge
and Pat it in so it'll look crazy while
we're here I'm just taking my Laura
Mercier powder little tapered powder
brush my really just taking the smallest
amount of this I'm setting the t-zone so
I don't look lately so now for the eyes
I'm gonna bring you guys in a little bit
closer so you can see what's going on up
here actually before we do that let's do
the brows I'll sober you in okay so for
my eyebrows I like to use this goof
proof brow pencil by benefit I just
start by filling them in do the edge
like so
and then I just go towards the center
and do like hair like strokes to the
other side and I comb it out by the way
this is shade number four and it works
perfect I go in with my honest aldia
brow gel to set that down and then on to
the eyes it was kind of hard to choose a
palette but I settled for one that has
so many options and I'm not gonna lie I
haven't been playing with this for too
long I've only probably had it for about
a month and a half but it's been my
go-to every time I wear makeup this
palette is screaming my name so I feel
like I need to share it with you guys
cuz it's that good and it for what you
get in here it's a great price so this
is the morphe 39a palette it's called
dare to create it has the most stunning
shades ever so I never wear crazy
sparkly eye makeup
that's just not my vibe I like sparkles
occasionally but I am more of a natural
kind of girl obviously like I have a lot
of face makeup on right now but I really
am but I don't love going too crazy with
my eyes but I love doing that this
palette is starting with this middle
shade here and blending that throughout
my crease you guys we're gonna trip when
you see the pigment that shows me like
casually running this through there I'm
not really trying to do anything you
know it's just so pretty
I love the range of colors in this
palette I love the pigment I love how
easy it blends it's kind of like your
dream palette and I like that it's not
too crazy pigmented so you don't feel
like intimidated just gonna take a clean
brush and kind of blend upwards nothing
is on this brush this is just to diffuse
that create a little bit so now with
kind of a smaller blending brush
something like this little tapered guy
I'm gonna go in with this last round
here oh yeah thank you
no wait and I'm just gonna kind of keep
this on the outer corner of the crease
and kind of towards the edge of the eye
just kind of creating like a little cat
eye then just kind of bringing it all
over my lid nothing too precise I just
love how this looks
this warm tone bronzy gorgeousness
I then like to take the lighter brown
shades and I kind of just take this on
if any little flat brush I have and I
kind of take just the first two they're
just stunning it kind of creates like a
gradient effect and and then with a
little tapered brush I just start over
so I take that middle shade and I do the
same thing on my lower lashes I just
blend this out and then I take any sort
of brush that's just a little bit more
precise so like this little kind of
dense shorter shader brush I take that
dark brown on the edge and I smudge it
up but keep it closer to with my lower
lash line and then I like to go in with
it this black at the edge right there
and I literally do like the tiniest
amount on an angled brush like so small
just on the edge like that's literally
it
lastly I'm just gonna go back in with
that dark dark brown on the edge there
and just to find the crease a little bit
more I kind of like doing like a light
whitish pinkish in the inner corner
infrared mode so I'm going to take this
highlighter I have it let me grab it so
I like to take this over one in the
shade ever glow and I kind of mix those
two pink white shades on a little mini
precise brush I kind of take that white
and a pink actually this is my new one
so it looks pretty untouched but I just
went through my other one and I just
kind of highlight that inner corner
and then I also just kind of bring it
right up there okay so for mascara
surprise surprise I'm using my Too Faced
better than sex mascara and I'm just
gonna do like a little coat like that
because I want to apply my favorite
policies and my favorite policies are
the demi whispies no you know I take you
back through not the demi wispies
they're just the wispies in the black
shade obviously um so I just kind of cut
them to my eye shape and make sure I
look stunning honey
so what I like to do with my lashes is
do a little bit of the glue on the empty
container and then I just take any brush
preferably one like like a skinnier end
and I just get that in the glue I pick
up the lash with a pair of tweezers and
then I just like to coat the lash do
this one all the time because I want to
let it dry and I focus most of the glue
on the corner so the inner corner in the
outer corner of the lash if you have
trouble applying your false lashes just
wait for the glue to dry it makes
literally all the difference in the
world so if you just let it get nice and
tacky it's gonna be 10 times easier to
apply to your eyelash and I like to
bring my mirror close in and I look down
and I go from an upward angle
so after I've applied my lashes I'm just
waiting for the glue to dry so if it's a
little bit white still it will dry clear
from taking my mascara again and I'm
just doing the smallest bit of the root
to blend them and then I just do my
lower lashes as well so after my
eyelashes are done I think these lashes
are stunning they're so affordable and I
love that the lash band is super thin so
it's very easy to apply
I've tried plenty of high-end and
drugstore lashes and when the band is
thick it's way way harder so call these
off Amazon I'll link them below they're
super cheap I for one don't like really
big lashes
I like big pretty lashes but not like
overwhelming and I think these are like
the perfect lash for me what I do after
I do that is I use my morphe prep insect
makeup setting spray and I spritz this
make sure your mascara is dry before you
do this because if it's not it will run
all over your face which isn't a big
deal because you can always just wipe it
away but it's just so much easier to let
it dry instead of like having to wipe
off my mascara so hopefully my dry
I'm obsessed with that so I don't like
the peanut butter baby I just take my
palette try it so after I'm done with
this I usually would probably wear like
the nude pink with this look but I
really want to share this formula with
you guys for my lips
it's the Lancome ready in five is the
shade and it's like this oil-based lip
paint it's called the matte shaker
so you shake it up and basically this is
great because my lips are really dry
right now and it's an oil and then it
looks like this and it's like this
gorgeous color it's like an orange a
pink they have them in a bunch of
different shades but it comes out so
sheer it's almost like a lip tint but
you'll see it's amazing and it's
hydrating so
see that's what it looks like on but I
feel like it doesn't really match my
look right now so maybe I'll do
something else but this is I'm going to
link it below anyway because it is one
of my favorite things and it looks
stunning when you don't have makeup on
and you just put this on you just look
like it looks like your natural lip
color it's really cool but I'm gonna put
something else on just because I want it
to be like a more nude pink right now
instead of like a strawberry pink if
that makes any sense so now that's off
I'm gonna choose something a little bit
more news like a brownish new I don't
really use this so I can't say this is
one of my favorites
it's the kathleenlights ultra glossy lip
and I love kathleenlights and this color
is perfect so I didn't use it all year
so I feel like it's wrong and it's a lie
to say it's my 2017 favorite but oh my
god this is gorgeous
okay I'm saying I didn't go back this is
one of my 2072
okay well that's stunning what shade is
this I will try and find this and link
down below and then one last time to
finish it off and spraying my face cuz
I'm addicted that's it for this video
