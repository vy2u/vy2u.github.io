I have a really exciting announcement
and Tyler Tim you guys I've seen on
Twitter and right Bailey and I have been
tweeting a lot about like this mystery
thing on December 12 both of you
probably already seen your eyes video or
fallen awry on Twitter and know what's
happening but for those of you who don't
follow me on Twitter header so for those
of you who have not seen your eyes video
or stories about me uh for those of you
who haven't seen my video or Twitter or
anything then you guys wouldn't know
that on December 12 I guess you could
call it like a little mini meet and
greet me Bailey not a senator I assure
are going to be as a opening uh-oh you
call opening store yeah what's a good
proper term like an opening store at the
ocean your opening story yes what's your
dream
yeah well beyond the store opening for
subdued which is in San Juanico AHA all
like the details and everything was down
below like the I dress the times ever
and my Bailey and I will be there from 4
p.m. to 6 p.m. it's December 12 on the
Saturday which is in my two weeks around
two weeks so hopefully this is like
enough notice for those of you that live
in California that want to come and meet
us but even more exciting announcements
the three of us actually got to
collaborate with subdued to make a
t-shirt which was so so exciting did you
feel real and a half a t-shirt here guy
have you got sunrise video you guys
already know what the teacher looks like
I'll list rise video down below in case
I forget to say something like important
that she said but um it looks like this
it says nope and then it says I'm fine
because we thought this was very
relatable these are just kind of like
sassy phrases that you would say like
I'm fine
or like no but not like nope I'm fine so
we just thought that was label butter
sausage human
because rather than the sausage moving
on the entire planet we thought of like
a positive acronym like in the inside of
the shirt and it says need only positive
energy and then it says heart Adobe
which is my Olivia Bailey I wasn't
paying attention okay just looking at
your beautiful good save Thanks oh this
is a limited edition t-shirt you can't
get this online you can't get this in
