I have a tutorial on this bronzy I
haven't thought of the title yet this is
just supposed to be kind of like a
goddess
glowy going from within Julie bronze
look just a couple of things before we
get into the video number one I'm really
sorry you guys have to continuously look
at this ugly background that I have I
have not gotten in to my YouTube room
yet so a YouTube room is being
constructed for me at the moment
in my house so it's not done yet but it
will be I think in the next couple weeks
hopefully by next week it should be done
so I can finally start filming videos in
there and it just has a prettier
background because right now my lighting
and stuff is all down there so I'm just
faced by a window but it doesn't fully
light up the back and make it look nice
and white and pretty and then also those
two lamps right there are broken so
number two is that I have a giveaway for
you guys and I'm really excited about it
because you guys know that throughout
this video I just want the most
highlighted look and or you don't know
that yet you're going to see as I get
when I start explaining especially
getting to the highlight part all I talk
about is wanting a highlighted look so I
am going to be giving away this is kind
of my 50000 giveaway that i was
promising so long ago just because we
hit a hundred thousand and i can see
we're growing so I obviously don't make
a lot of money myself as person so I
can't you know buy nice things like some
other youtubers like iPhones and like
cameras and stuff but I just thought
with what I could buy with my own money
is what I would give you so I'm going to
be giving away an honest Razia glow kit
this is just mine mine the other ones
actually packaged over there and I'm not
going to get it because I want you guys
to be able to see what it is so if you
want to enter you know what you're
entering it has a for amazing highlight
shades and I basically used it right
here so if you like the way it looks um
you are going to like this so to enter
this giveaway all you have to do is be
subscribed to my channel this giveaway
is for my subscribers so yeah you must
be subscribed to my channel if you want
to enter a second you have to comment a
video request something that you guys
want to see and then you also just have
to give this video a thumbs up
get into the video and I really hope you
guys all enjoy it first things first is
moisturiser I'm going in with my
oil-free moisturizer sensitive skin
Neutrogena um I just take pump like a
pump and just go like this and then just
all over I'm then going in with my Mac
strobe cream I'm obsessed with this
stuff it gives you just a really glowy
look dupe for Mac strobe cream like
identical is the L'Oreal I'll have the
name right out there but it's a everyone
it's called but I've used it videos
before I'm completely out of it so
otherwise I would have used it but I
tried and it came out like water no
bueno
instead of taking something that's too
expensive I know I just used a Mac
strobe cream as a high-end product I'm
trying to give you guys dupes for it
just because I know that some of us
don't want to and can't just go out and
buy Mac strobe cream and I get that so
trust me like I feel like half my mom's
makeup or like get sent a lot of it so I
don't make a bunch of money as a 16 year
old I'm not like going out and spending
all my money on makeup either so I got
it I get you don't worry instead of
using a really really expensive spray
like sometimes I use my tatcha luminous
skin mist in videos I have a really
great alternative this is my Narada
central si toner I'm going to spray this
all over my Real Techniques sponge or
even spray it straight to your face but
I'm just going to spray it on this to
kind of help our foundation blend in any
way and then what I'm going to do is
just the lazy way just stripe some
foundation on my face
I take that flat side and I just Pat
that in to the skin
you actually use glory Oh true match
this probably will give you a closer
look just because it's like this
luminous kind of Foundation which is
amazing and this one is just really
hydrating but it's the one that matches
my skin the best at least so I'm going
to be using these amazing Rimmel match
perfection concealers they are these
super light concealers I don't know
they're just amazing so there's a fair
light and fair so I'm going to start I'm
going to double layer them just because
they're a little bit light and leverage
and I have some dark circles coming
through start with fair and just get a
generous amount of that and start by
kind of doing a triangle under my eye
I'm also taking this color called fair
light which is like a little bit lighter
I know this is a lot but I just I just
like it and I'm just focusing that on
the inner corner and then try to drag it
that way
so after you do that I'm also going to
take the lighter shade we use the color
fair light and highlight the high points
of our face so I'm just going to cover
that a little and then just do this on
my chin I'm also going to take it down
okay
that was awful just gonna try and make
that a little bit straighter get it-get
amount of that and just let's try that
again
then before going for that kind of
highlighted look I'm just keeping it
really glowy and like light and I'm not
rubbing or anything I'm going to kind of
blend like Pat rubbing like dabbing I'm
sorry I'm going to take this Sigma in
the saddle bronzer kind of plushy powder
I'm going to start by you know warming
up my face I'm not really contouring
just yet
just kind of like warming my cheeks
I'm also just going to take that bronzer
and bring it kind of up around my
forehead so I'm just moving this back a
little and then dusting see how bronzy
that is and kind of dusting it up and
that was a lot but it's okay and then
after we do that I'm just gonna bring
that down here
then just down my neck we are going to
go in over top of that this Milani baked
bronzer in the shade 0-4 glow so I'm
just going to be using that exact same
brush I'm not putting this everywhere
just cuz you don't want to look like
sparkly unicorn threw up on your face
but I am just going to take this on my
cheeks because we want to add more color
and just kind of get a glowy look I'm
taking my mate Mae Mac I can't talk it's
like this insane thing where it's like I
knew I gotta speak English but use me
every time I'm filming a video it's
wonderful I'm using my Rimmel stay matte
pressed powder and just taking this on a
high cheekbone highlighter F of three
yeah three brush by Sigma but honestly
this looks like such a perfect setting
brush though screw the system you know
just under my eyes down my nose and
right in the center of my forehead after
we are done with that you're supposed to
be looking quite bronzed as you can tell
we are now we just want to add a little
highlight and glow to our look so the
first thing I'm going to do is I'm
taking my Becca shimmering skin
Perfector pressed powder in opal it
broke okay okay we're going to use it
but I can't show you it or yep that will
happen and then just kind of dip it in
there oh mama we got a lot and then just
put this you know worried about it let's
be real just kind of using it almost as
a blush but not just like keeping at the
top there kind of
oh my god it's just so pretty it's just
so pretty I like I go a little overboard
because it is just so pretty I'm just
gonna bring it up here as well because I
can and I want to I'm high line the tip
of my nose also was just the remainder
so you because I think it looks nice and
kind of like my chin and all up
we're just highlighting then I'm going
in with my Anasazi aglow kit which look
can we just like take a moment these
shades are wonderful I think I'm going
to go in with this or this I'm either
going to go in with crushed pearl or
mimosa so when you have that situation
my solution is you mix and then go over
top with that because now you look like
a freaking glowing sun goddess and I'm
also taking this kind of right in the
center of my face and kind of like above
my brows just to like really give me
some glow because that's what I want I'm
also just going to take this honest
nausea glow kit and use that shade
mimosa on a crease brush and just blend
that into my crease we're just doing a
sparkly bronze all over so and then I'm
just taking my trusty old ring finger oh
I was weird I couldn't get it and taking
mimosa and then just putting that all
over the whole entire lid just really
pressing my in then I'm going in with
crushed pearl and just directly placing
that on the center of the lid for some
highlight and then blending out flat
brush I don't know and I'm using that
color crushed no mimosa that bronzy
shimmer and then just
you couldn't really see me but I just
put that on my lower lash of it and I'm
taking crushed pearl and highlighting
the inside of my eye
like after that I'm just going to
just do a really thin line trying to do
anything crazy here after we are done
with that I'm just going to go with some
major coats of mascara because why not
Smith's car is show good wow I forgot
how much I liked this this is the
voluminous false fiber lashes with his
waterproof this is L'Oreal I think
then lastly I would put false lashes on
if if you were going out or this was a
nighttime look or you just wanted to
give it an extra pop but since I'm
trying to make this kind of an everyday
wearable glowy look I think just coding
your lashes with big mascara will do the
trick
lastly just finishing off I'm using my
NYX natural lip pencil and it's in the
shade natural kind of phrase that weird
it's the NYX lip liner pencil in the
shade natural
what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna take
that color oh I can't ever open this
crushed pearl just take it on this
stuffy ride and go like that because I
think that looks really fun if you're
going to blend out the edges and there
you have it that is your bronzy gold
goddess glowy makeup tutorial I hope you
guys all enjoyed it this might be one of
my favorite looks just because it is so
