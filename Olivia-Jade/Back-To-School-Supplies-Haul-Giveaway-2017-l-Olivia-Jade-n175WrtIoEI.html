back to my youtube channel in today's
video as you can tell by the title I am
giving you guys a little bit of a
giveaway for back to school
no one likes talking about school I know
I get it I'm in school too but it's the
thing we all have to go through so I
thought I would hope that giveaway for
you guys I just want to target and I got
a few things it's not one of those
outrageous crazy giveaways where there's
like computers and stuff I got inside
the backpack a pencil case and then a
few school supplies I kind of forget
what you need for school and I'm still
in school um I just like don't want to
think about it so I don't really
remember but we're going to see if I did
an okay job let's get started with the
giveaway all the rules to enter will be
down below but there's going to be a
link you just have to follow the link if
you follow my social media you have more
entries a better chance to win the
levels of the box I got three folders I
hate binders sweating get binders plus I
didn't know what you guys would need but
I use soldiers because kinder is always
get messy and I shufflings in pockets in
binders I never hole punch anything so
I'm going to shove things in pockets I'd
rather have them in folders so I got
this cute little penis this little green
one for both BAM I also got this flag
star college-ruled
notebook I think this would be good you
put all your subjects in they're good to
go I think it is so important to stay
organized so I got my planner and it's
very cute I think it's adorable can
write down your homework is Justin work
or what to film with your new teacher
right really anything
I got pencils they're a little
demolished but 1e 0.7 23.5 twenty zero
point nine six feet pencils and they're
all mechanical cheers to that post-it
notes I love this in high school I'm
still in high school but when I like to
start at high school in the beginning I
love co-students being organized we're
going to see how that goes for me this
year but hopefully you guys stay on task
and I got sharpies highlighters serving
a better pilot to pink to yellow to
orange to green one blue and one purple
I got white out I make so many mistakes
in school
why does white not have a W how about
always been like that
or just Amendola effect y'all okay well
I got you white house spelled with the W
I got these pens there's so many colors
they're ballpoint you don't know what
that means ultra smooth ink my paper
mate not bothered everyone needs black
and blue at some point in their lives so
ignore what's going on the back of my
hair hey oh no after my house are three
anaphase huh I got you on a little mini
stapler and this adorable mid green
color and these little black tab thing
that you can like mark your book in or
your planner that I got you flash cards
I got colored ones because white ones
are really boring I hope this would make
it a little bit more fun for you guys
study you cuz studying can be fun I
thought this is so cute this is an
office accessory kit it has 120 paper
clips 35 pushpins and 18 binder clips
and it's just like the best packaging
ever and it's all very aesthetically
pleasing so one of you needed this I'm
still in my water
that's everything supply wise and I also
got you guys this pencil case from
Herschel I thought it was really cute
it's kind of big let me open it
I like having like a nice guy oh that is
way too big for a pencil case
it looks way smaller online okay well I
got you guys a toilet kids because this
is just a ginormous so that would not
work for a pencil case well I guess it
could if you wanted it to but I've gotta
get a little twitch case maybe if you
guys want to put your pencils in here
you can I bad and I also got this
adorable like pink backpack the only
thing with this is I believe this is the
kids size because it looks a little bit
small so if you guys want to use it just
for personal use and not for school
backpack that's totally fine but also if
you don't need a lot for your school if
you just need like a computer you don't
need a huge backpack then this would
work really great but if you're like
need a huge school backpack
this probably wouldn't be the best one
because it's a little bit smaller I
don't know we can tell us but I think
it's adorable on the colors great so I
still wanted to give it away hope you
guys enjoy and make sure to LIKE comment
and subscribe and I'll see you in the
next video
