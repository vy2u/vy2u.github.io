back to my youtube channel in today's
video I'm doing something so so
requested so I'm very excited to film
this but I just want to let you guys
know before we get started a little
disclaimer I've gone to a school or I've
changed schools multiple times but every
school I've ever been to since I was 5
years old has required a uniform so I
don't exactly know what dress code is or
what dress code means or what's
appropriate so I kind of just put
together some outfits that I thought
would be really cute if I was allowed to
wear free dress I guess really sorry if
this is not your dress code if it makes
you feel any better I can't wear any
free dress at all so there's that hey
hope you guys enjoy this video please
make sure to give it a like and comment
down below whatever you want but also
make sure to subscribe we were almost
out of million and I'm going to be doing
a very very big giveaway at a million
I've been saving up for it so with that
being said I hope you guys enjoy and
let's get started okay outfit one this
bodysuit is from forever 21 I'll have it
linked down below but if you can't wear
something like this you could just wear
a bodysuit that covers both shoulders
just something black was my idea these
pants are Topshop and then these shoes
are adidas these pants are super old so
Topshop is creating pant flutter like
this again so I've linked a similar pair
down below but yeah this is the first
outfit okay so for outfit number two
what my sweater is misguided I believe I
have one for misguided link down below
because I can't remember where this is
from but misguided does an exact one and
I'm pretty sure I ordered it from
misguided my jeans are Levi's and I got
them off of a website called Shopbop and
I will have those link down below and
then my favorite little furry sides from
Gucci I'm gonna link down below
very similar slides inspired by Gucci
from forever 21 I mean literally every I
feel like website is doing these types
of slides now and if you can't wear
slides you can just throw in some
sneakers and if you can't wear an
off-the-shoulder sweater you could just
throw on a regular sweater so yeah
outfit number three this sweater is from
H&amp;amp;M I actually got this in store it sold
out online but I'm gonna link one from
H&amp;amp;M that I think gives the same vibe my
shorts are one teaspoon any basic denim
short would work and then my shoes or
Doc Martens again if some of these
pieces are overpriced or just not in the
right budget you guys can just take
inspiration I'm not saying you have to
use this exact outfit but yeah this is
often number three I thought it was very
chic and casual so outfit four might be
one of my favorites my top is at forever
21 are you allowed to wear tank tops in
school I'm not sure if you can't just
draw on a sweater because that's stupid
shoulders don't mean anything but anyway
my jeans are Levi's those same Levi's
again will be linked down below and then
I just have some classic white bands
so my last outfit Perez just disclaimer
I don't know why my posing is so weird
in this but the top is forever21
leggings are Lululemon's and then I just
have some adidas enemies on the shoes
are a little bit pricier off of nano
portait so I'm gonna link a similar vibe
down below I just thought this was kind
of the perfect outfit when you're lazy
or if you have like a workout PE class
or whatever just something that like
looks like you didn't try but you still
look kind of put together in cheek so
guys that's it for this video thank you
so so much for watching I hope you
enjoyed it and I will see you guys next
time
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
