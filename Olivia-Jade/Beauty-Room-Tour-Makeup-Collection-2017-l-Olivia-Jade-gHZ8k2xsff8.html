today's video as you can tell by the
title I am showing you my game room tour
and my makeup collection I aside I just
feed through this really quickly just
show you what I've got in my makeup
drawers I didn't really go slowly
through any of it just because I kind of
wanted to get it done show you
personally for me I don't like sitting
through every single product I kind of
like seeing an overview but if you do
want me to go back and do every single
product and kind of go more into depth
with my makeup then just let me know and
I will definitely do that I know I have
a lot of makeup honestly most of it is
spent to me from being on YouTube I'll
about all of you guys so I am doing a
beauty giveaway link is down below and
I'll also have the video down below
where you guys can see the actual
products you can win it but yeah thank
you so much for the constant support
just getting me to even you know make a
beauty room is kind of insane I hope you
guys love it I know everybody has
someone with video for a while ever
since freaking 4,000 years ago I posted
the beginning stages of my beady room
and then never followed up but it's
finally done it definitely took some
long long thinking and building and
everything like that
all the furniture is IKEA thanks for
watching I love you I hope you enjoy it
and let's get started so bear with me
I'm going to try and show you the best I
can so this is the door to get in and
when you open it you see it overview of
this and then we're back to the door so
when you walk in at the first corner I
guess right here is just some extra
storage at the top two drawers where I
just kind of keep like random camera
stuff or all these nail polishes Essie
sent the back of giveaway prizes just
camera and other lens random stuff
basically it goes in here I know it's
not very organized I'm just trying to do
trying to find a better way to keep
things a little bit more organized and
then in these random drawers I just have
stuff that didn't fit other places so I
have some loving pants
this is how I felt and myself and then
some bigger palette in here I have all
my Sigma products which I love very much
and they actually sent this over like
this so it made it really easy to store
away and here I just have some MAC
lipsticks and I just have a bunch of
foundations because I did a video using
these foundations so obviously I got to
keep my babies stored away and then
these drawers are all empty in here I
just have some random backdrops in these
little boxes and that's about it for
this for this whole section so that's
the front door
that's that and then when you turn this
way before you get to that whole section
I have two closets I guess it's one
closet two doors you know I need this is
where I just store all my lighting and
my tripod and all that good stuff I'll
put in a little overlay of what it looks
like when I'm filming with my lights but
if I just want to keep it nice and clean
in my room especially for this video and
you to impress you guys I just keep it
kind of tucked away I want to go to this
section this whole thing is where I edit
so I have my big desktop I have a mic
and then yeah I also have my 100,000
plaque so that's very exciting and in
these drawers I just have like hair ties
a knife I know that seems concerning but
it's because I open up my packages with
it and just random stuff like that this
drawer I just have some more random
stuff
so that's what my little desk area looks
like and then right to the left of my
desk I have this door but it just goes
to the bathroom I never use it and then
when you come to the right of my desk I
have my two IKEA drawers okay is it
bothering anyone else that they're not
closed all the way so at the top of my
IKEA drawers I just have all my makeup
brushes I know they look a little bit
crazy but that's kind of what's
happening and then I also have
just a little lip collection of
lipsticks and then I have all my makeup
in these drawers I guess I'll just show
you really quick what I keep in all of
these drawers
so in the top one I have primers brows
and then some makeup remover wipes this
is not very organized so I'm really
sorry and then this top drawer is where
I just keep like lotions setting sprays
chopstick and then like random tools
like sharpeners brow CRO brow curlers I
mean eyelash curlers and all that and
then in this drawer I keep all my
concealers right here and then all my
powders and then over here I keep I
pencil and then liquid liner and then
gel and I also have all my drugstore
mascara in here it was kind of
overflowing like pushed it to the side a
little bit in the third drawer to the
left I have all my foundations as you
can see I have it in the messiest way
possible I was willing to organize all
this I just haven't figured out the best
way to do so and then this third drawer
I have all my eye pigment so I have like
these amazing milk ones I'm obsessed and
this random like single shadows glitters
the fourth drawer I have some bronzing
palettes I have some highlighters
my Sephora collection highlighting
palette stuff like that and in this
drawer I have all my drugstore or
affordable eyeshadow palettes with color
pop this I just used in a first
impressions video I'm obsessed with it
and then in this drawer I have cream
blushes cream highlighters and liquid
all that jazz then over here I have all
my high-end palettes wipe two-faced
Laura Mercier naked way makeup forever
all that and right here I have more
bronzers and blushes and just powder
products and as you can see and then
right here I have some lashes just some
lash equipment I'm here I have all my
high-end mascara
I actually ended up having to separate
them from just Rihan because it was
overflowing so that's that then in this
drawer I keep some nudey pink lipsticks
liquid lipsticks lip glosses I really
don't have an organization method
I guess because there's so many lip
products and then when I go down here I
have nothing and down here I just have
some random lipsticks that I've been
sent that when you have too many you
don't know what shades they are so
that's what's happening down here and
then right over here
I have more lipsticks and liquid
lipsticks and lip glosses and random
stuff then down here I have more lip
glosses lipsticks lip liners it's so
messy and Rindge and that is it for my -
I hear drawers kind of crazy I'm sorry
if it was shaky and annoying and blurry
but I'm trying
once you come over this way I just have
the background where I film this was
kind of new for me I'm just trying to
see how I like it and then you're back
at the door that's what in your room
I'll come back and I'll do a little
overview again so I'm standing at the
door once you go all the way around
that's what it looks like
so that is it I hope you guys enjoyed my
duty room tour let me know what you guys
think let me know if you have any tips
for me to organize my makeup a little
bit better it would mean the world to me
I love you and I'll see you guys next
time
