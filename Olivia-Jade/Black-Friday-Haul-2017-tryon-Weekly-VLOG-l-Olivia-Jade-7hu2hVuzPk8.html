another video it's a little black friday
hall slash blog so I'm in New York right
now I went to the mall and I went
shopping because I had to but I only
went to H&amp;amp;M I'm gonna show you all the
stuff that I picked out from H&amp;amp;M and
then we'll get into the blog so if you
guys are new here if you're looking for
Black Friday hauls and you stumbled
across this one I'm Olivia Jade you
should subscribe and stick around
because the vlogs are really fun well I
think so and a lot of people really seem
to like them just a little bit behind
the scenes of my life and all that stuff
also be here talking I'm at my grandma's
house with my family so they're in the
back
but yeah you guys know this is obviously
not minimal background ourselves as you
no doubt I'm not home so H&amp;amp;M got some
really cute stuff the first thing I need
to start with is this ugly Christmas
sweater
um because I just thought this was so
funny my sister and I got matching ones
and it says Yolo Christmas on it it's so
not necessary but it's really soft and
big and oversized and I mean like why
not these pants are so cute but I got
two pairs of like these amazing pants
I'm in a size 4 so these pants they're
like these paper bag I always did cream
ones they fit so well and they look so
cute but just like cuffs at the ankle I
love them I also got these incredible
corduroys they're like the most
flattering a high-waisted that make you
look so so good and they just fit really
well
and they were on sale from like $40
which is already really cheap but then
they were like I think 15 yeah they were
15 so I've worn them like four times
already I'm obsessed and I've only had
them for two days so that doesn't make
any sense you get what I was gonna say
okay it's this really big oversized tan
knit sweater and it's so cozy and it
goes down like all the way to right
above your knee so I think it looks so
cute and just comfortable and it just
gives like that oversized kind of like
easy but I've in my opinion this sweater
is so comfortable I got a really good
deal on this I think
I got this well I know I got this for
$20 and I think it was like 50 before so
it's just like this big gray sweater I'm
obsessed with it it's so cozy and soft
another gray sweater this one it has
like these really cute stars on it and
this is such good quality it's like a
little bit of a high-neck and it's so
soft and comfortable and I just had to
have it because it's like amazing got
this sweater this is like my favorite
thing ever and it was only $19
it just says dreams of dreams all over
it and I just think it's like different
it's a high-neck I love the pattern and
the print and everything I just think
it's so great so I almost like cried
when I saw this because I saw it online
and then it went out of stock I was like
I'm never gonna find it and then I went
to an H&amp;amp;M in New York City and they
didn't have it so I was like completely
hopeless and then I went to another H&amp;amp;M
and they had it there and I was like one
last thing I got that kind of same I
unfortunately didn't get this on sale
but I will tell you something after I
got this sweater it was $49 and it has
all these pearls on it I think it's like
very Gucci vibes and its really soft and
comfy so I loved it
also a little trick if you guys download
the H&amp;amp;M app this isn't sponsored look at
the desk when I was paying told me this
she gave me 20% off my entire order
because of downloading the app so if you
guys want to try that or download other
apps of like different stores you're
playing in a shop at I know what some of
them have some good deals all of this
wasn't even over $300 by the end so
anyway that's my little haul thank you
