my channel today I'm doing an unboxing
haul of brandy Melville and bauble bar
so if you guys do want to see it what I
got from brandy melville and blah blah
blah right then just keep watching and I
think there's only one thing in here
from bauble bar so I'm gonna start with
that oh that's so cute they put your
order they put your order I'm history
packaged in this little neon envelope
looks like that
that's so cute ahh oh that's so pretty
it's like you can see it wait yes I
think if this is going the right way
it's a gray in the middle I'm gonna have
like little diamonds around it fake
diamonds obviously and then in the back
things like that so now for this
unboxing haul from brandy melville oh
you can see my address maybe let's not
do that
um yeah shouldn't be too long because I
only have bauble bar and Granny Melville
to show you but I think we got a lot
from here it feels that mean it's a
pretty big box and I don't know anything
that I got so we're about to find out
came in this little package and first it
comes with let's see hey gray sweater in
the middle of it it's not mesh but it
kind of has like a weird hole pattern
and can you see that and then well
should I guess what is this oh this is a
basic black t-shirt it looks kind of
cropped but it's long-sleeved it's not
just solid black and has AG lines coming
down it and then lastly in this little
package I got oh yeah I remember
ordering this this looks huge this is
like a grey sweater and then it has the
little buttons of it or this is like a
t-shirt sweater I don't know it's cute
whoa
very basic as you can see I don't really
go out of the box and go colorful I go
black gray or white or go home
I am home not to make sense oh I guess
that's it we're gonna be a very short
video and next I got this sweater and
it's gray again but BAM look at me it
has black on the sleeves two black lines
looks like this very basic very gray
very boring not for me
I also got a gray sweater and it's a
sweater it feels very soft and it looks
cropped so I like that
and then lastly finishing up the very
short bubble bar and brandy melville
haul I got this um oh it's a turtleneck
that's cute um you just fold it over it
looks very loose it's just a big grey
sweater again so as you can see I'm
really going strong with coloring sites
that's my very short video of everything
I got this is literally gonna be like a
two-minute video oops
thank you guys so much for watching my
short very short we're gonna do Melville
and Bob our haul I hope you guys all
enjoyed and if you guys do want any of
