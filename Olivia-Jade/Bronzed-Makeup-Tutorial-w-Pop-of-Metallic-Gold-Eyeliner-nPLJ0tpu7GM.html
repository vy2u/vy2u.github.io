my channel today I'm filming a makeup
tutorial for you guys and the image I
have on this is supposed to be very like
bronzed a lot of Browns just very tan
summer glow and then we're gonna do like
a pop of gold eye shadow on the eye and
like a nude pink lip so if you guys do
want to see how to create this look then
just keep watching okay so first I must
start with the primer and I'm using the
Laura Mercier foundation primer in like
the hydrating one nothing like putting
makeup on it 8:30 at night so you can
take it off go to shower and then go to
sleep for school tomorrow oh yes after
you apply your primer I'm using my
foundation which is the NARS sheer glow
in the color gobe and my real I poked
myself in the eye my Real Techniques
multi-task brush that's hard to get okay
I'm just taking this and then just like
going in circular motions around my face
and blending it in and down my neck okay
after I spent 30 years just doing my
foundation I'm applying this Maybelline
fit me concealer in the shade 20 and I'm
just applying this under my eyes and
that's it that's Molly blend them apply
I'm blending it out with my ring finger
I'm using my ring finger to blend it out
because underneath your eyes your skin
is super delicate and if you tell them
to pull too hard you can wrinkle really
easily but your ring fingers a lot
softer and it doesn't apply as much
pressure as your pointer finger or your
thumb also using your hand instead of a
brush your hand has natural heat on it
so it makes it look natural and it's a
faster way to apply your concealer
foundation my hair looks kind of funny I
hate this mirror so much so after you're
done applying your foundation and
concealer I'm using this translucent
mattifying powder by elf and honestly
this isn't translucent this definitely
has color to it oh you'd be what is this
can you not look what what is that okay
and next we are applying a bronzer and
blush
since this look supposed to be very
bronzed and have a lot of Browns
incorporated into it you are gonna just
go ham so I'm using Laguna by NARS and
this BH Cosmetics brush I don't know
what it is but we're just gonna contour
with that
I'm taking like the edge and then
dipping it in a typical face I'm doing
the edge of it and then you're gonna do
the flat part in there we are going
crazy with the bronzer and use that as a
blush as well just to really bronze up
your face and give it a very bronzed
summer glow let's count how many times
they say bronzed in this video if you
literally comment that down below how
many times I said bronze your objec and
going in on a jawline I don't even know
what I'm saying at my life okay after
you apply 17,000 layers of bronzer
you're set just gonna take the color
orgasm Pienaar's and just kind of do it
really lightly just to do a little pink
on the cheeks we're done with our face
and now we're gonna move on to the eyes
so I'm gonna bring you a little bit
closer so you can see what I'm doing
okay so this is after the foundation and
blush and bronzer have all settled in
and now we're moving on to the eyes and
what I have in mind is we're gonna go
super matte very bronze and then do a
pop of gold kind of like a metallic gold
pencil eyeliner I'm gonna start with my
Urban Decay potion eyeshadow eyeshadow
primer potion goodness I haven't used
this in such a long time after done with
that you can take your eyeshadow I'm
using the lorac Pro palette and I'm
going to start by using the shade my
hand has gotten it that's cool taupe
which is right there and I'm just gonna
use that on this kind of flat top
precision brush and don't really pick
your brush I don't know what you would
call this looks like this I'm just gonna
put that all over my lid
so after we're done with that we're just
going to be taking this big blending
brush with no shadows on it and just
blending out the crease making sure
there are no harsh lines and everything
super seamless so after you've done with
that I'm going to take this dark dark
brown right there and it's called sable
and I'm gonna take it on a tapered kind
of a thicker tapered brush and just do
it on the tip and put this dress on the
outer third of our eyelid to give a
little bit more dimension to the look so
we're just gonna do a little bit digging
the same blending brush
that looks like this and then I'm just
blending out that color called sable we
put on the outer third of our eyelid I'm
not bringing in that dark sable color
until we get kind of almost nothing on
this brush and then I'll just bring the
leftovers into the inner corner but when
we're first blending it out you don't
want to bring those harsh dark colors
into the inner corner it will make you
look a little bit tired and din then I'm
going to pick up a little bit of that
dark dark brown right next to the black
on this brush called espresso and work
that into the crease
and now I'm going in with this white
color and I'm just putting that on my
brow bone see how white that is boom
so I'm not for the most difficult part
we're gonna do eyeliner if you're not
skilled with eyeliner or you're a
beginner I will walk you through it as
best as I can we're just gonna put this
on the top lash line and hope for the
best
and you go in the inner corner and do it
I just keep going back in with it and
just intensifying it
and then we're just gonna go in and
you're on the other eye which I'm not
gonna show you because it does take a
little bit of time after you finish
putting the gold on your top lash line
I'm also gonna bring it down and bring
it on a lower lash line
and then after you're done with that I'm
gonna take this black eyeliner pencil
and just put this in my tight line after
you finish tight lining your tight line
with a black pencil are you filming me
after you finished high lining with some
black eyeliner I'm just gonna go in with
this Bobbi Brown party mascara and just
coat my top lashes
and I'm also coating my bottom lashes
lastly finishing off with a nude pink
lip not really that nude just kind of
pinkish it's this color and it is elfs
wink pink
then I'm gonna go over with this
shimmery gloss well not really that
shimmery but it's called bear baby and
it's by Laura Mercier that's it for this
makeup tutorial I hope you guys all
enjoyed it let me know down below what
you thought or think thank you guys all
so much for watching and I will see my
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
