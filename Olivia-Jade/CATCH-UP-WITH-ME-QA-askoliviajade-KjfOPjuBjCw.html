hi guys welcome back to my channel today
I'm doing a quick little Q&amp;amp;A with you
guys I think I'm gonna answer five to
ten questions that I like the best I
asked you guys to ask me questions on my
Twitter account which is just Olivier G
newly it's like eight 37:55 same thing
it's late at night okay um and I school
tomorrow it's Wednesday this is gonna be
up the night I filmed it so I or I think
I really hope you guys enjoy this video
and let's go ahead and get started with
the questions I really hope they are
interesting okay let's start with this
question
oMG love you Olivia how do you block the
haters out and how did you get the
courage to make a youtube hashtag ask
Olivia Jane so we're walking out the
haters is quite easy you just ignore
them you you kind of what I like to do
is I realize how many people support me
and all the nice and really sweet
comments that you guys give me and then
the haters are irrelevant and then how
did I get the courage to make it YouTube
it's something that I always wanted to
do when I was younger I it's actually
funny my mom never let me watch YouTube
or go on YouTube who knows little you
can ask any of my friends if they ever
wanted to go on YouTube at my house it'd
be like no no I can't because my mom
only thought there was like dangerous
stuff on YouTube or like inappropriate
stuff in it realize it was like a whole
nother world funny it's ironic I wasn't
even allowed to look up any YouTube
video so what I did the second I watched
my first makeup video I was like holy
crap this I didn't even know about this
like whole world but I loved it and I
want to be a part of it so I didn't
really talk to my mom about it I just
kind of did it and then she was like
totally fine with it what should you do
if your crush is dating your friend love
you love you too um if your crush is
dating your friend then you've got to
let it be they're in a relationship so
don't try and mess with it because then
your friend's not going to like you and
then your question
like you so just wait til things end
with them and give it time before you go
after your crush because especially if
it's your friend this guy or girl might
be off-limits not for you at least for
when they're dating and a little bit
after why don't you have a blog like
Bella you should get one
ask Olivia Jane um because I have a
YouTube channel and I see you guys can
tell I'm having a rough time keeping up
with that lately so vlog would just be a
whole nother story maybe in the future
I'll do something with a blog but as of
right now I'm just gonna stick to
YouTube Instagram Twitter which i think
is a lot it's an option of snapchat so
um yeah I pretty much share my life with
you guys I'm pretty public on everything
right now I'm just gonna let that kind
of be my sister's thing and then maybe
one day but as of right now it's kind of
Bella's thing I kind of my youtube
channel I can't even keep up with my
YouTube videos anymore let alone a whole
blog a--they be crazy what is your
advice on liking someone and the signs
ah I guess if they tell you they like
he's pretty good sign and then if
they're they want to be around you if
they're texting you're you know when is
your birthday oh and can we be best
friends I love you I love you too and my
birthday is September 28th so I think
it's in five days what's the date the
23rd right yeah it's in five days um and
of course we can be best friends we have
a job how do you juggle school homework
social life and YouTube so school and
social life is not too difficult I just
try to get all my work done during the
week and then have my weekends open but
sometimes that's not the case so I kind
of use Sunday as my workday and I go out
Friday and Saturday so Sunday I kind of
know like you're not gonna be doing
anything too fun on Sunday you're gonna
be kind of at home doing your homework
that's kind of my data like rest up for
the week of school balancing youtube in
school and social YouTube has definitely
been really hard to balance for me
lately
I haven't been posting videos once a
week like I said I would and every video
I keep promising okay
this time I'm gonna post once a week
like but it's just not happening and
honestly I thought I'd posted my last
video like four or five days ago it's
almost been 13 days or maybe it has been
I don't even know and when I saw that I
was actually like a heartbroken I felt
so bad I was like what am i doing to my
viewers this is awful so then I just sat
down and wanted to film a quick little
Q&amp;amp;A and kind of share with you where
I've been and everything like that so I
I'm not doing a great job balancing my
youtube and my schoolwork and homework
and social life but what I think helps
the most is just taking that time for
yourself pick a day a weekend or a day
in the school week and just kind of have
that day to yourself and be like okay
I'm gonna take like a nice relaxing spa
day do all my homework
take a nice hot shower bath and just
kind of like get in the zone one of my
best friends goes do you know how much I
adore you ask Olivia Jade Bailey do you
know how much I adore you guys honestly
ah Bailey is one of the sweetest Souls
you'll ever meet in your entire life
best to giving advice so mature so kind
to everybody honestly the best best
friend you can ask for I love her to
bits and pieces she's the sweetest so
Bailey if you're watching this I love
you thank you guys so much for watching
this video I love you all and I'll see
you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
