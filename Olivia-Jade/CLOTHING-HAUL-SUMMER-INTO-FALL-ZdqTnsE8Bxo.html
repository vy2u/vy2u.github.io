I am doing a very requested video which
is a clothing haul as you guys can tell
by the title we are now coming into fall
and it's still a hundred thousand
degrees in LA where you guys are at my
feet a little bit chillier but I just
like to apologize before we get into
this video because most of the stuff
that I got is still like summer hot
weather clothing um so it's cold where
you are this stuff probably isn't good
for you right now but I would like to
show you what I got
anyway and my phone is dinging and I'll
be right back so yeah let's go ahead and
get started into I don't like how I say
let's go ahead and get started that
makes me feel like a teacher that's like
annoying let's go ahead and get started
into the lesson and you're like no
that's
that was me strangling the teacher
that's creepy um so let's get started
and I hope you guys enjoy the video it's
like I'm low down I think I should maybe
crank that yeah there we go so I'm going
to start with brandy Melville I'll start
with this little shirt that I got just
this grey t-shirt it's very simple it's
cute and it's gray so it goes with a lot
and that's what the back looks like next
is this little tank it's cute though
it's I kind of wear these shirts to bed
because they're so soft but also they
look so cute with high-waisted jeans or
like you know I got this little halter
shirt which I don't what I think I like
the color I've wore this shirt in the
video I did with my mom which was the
whisper challenge with her I'll link it
down below if you haven't seen it but I
wore this shirt in it so if you guys
like the shirt I was wearing that this
is it from brandy melville I got the
exact same one in this striped strike
pattern guys see that caught my arm
because I was trying to move my tripod
in it
me you two problems this shirt from
random elbow which i think is so
adorable and then this shirt from brandy
melville which is just this big white
take it's huge and it's so soft and it's
kind of heavy it almost kind of like
weighs you down a little bit but it's
giant and lastly from bringing my bow
I just got wait is this from brandy
melville yeah definitely is I got this
little shirt that just is California on
it next let's go to Free People
I think it's adorable it's like this
little blue dress and it's kind of short
it's so summery and so fun I mean I know
that it's not summer anymore but as I
said in LA it's a hundred thousand
degrees for still a pretty long time
it's high 90s all next week and all
that's next
from Free People this dress was really
interested me a little bit lower in the
back I'm like a little shorter in the
front but it's like ankle length pretty
much I'm gonna try to stand up and show
you it so it just like goes like that
I'm Massey from Free People I don't know
how I feel about this yet but I think I
think on it's gonna be kind of cute it's
just like this long-sleeve dress kind of
looks like medieval times which I'm like
kind of weirded out by but like I'm kind
of into it just looks like that I think
it's cute if you put it with sneakers
yeah that's pretty much all I would wear
it would be like sneakers and then like
it's like a cool bandana or something
might be kind of cool then we have some
stuff from Urban Outfitters so first I
just got this t-shirt to workout in
I mean it's just a tank top I got this
shirt that I'm wearing from Urban
Outfitters also got it in just like
neutral tan color and I also got it in
this light blue color and it's the lime
wearing as I said I really like it it
fits really well and it's perfect
because it's so freakin hot here I can't
deal
this is from Solis London but I want to
say I got it off of ASOS but I don't
remember it looks like this and then it
just goes down it's fairly short I got
this from ASOS as well and ok you see
I'm very intrigued by it or did I get
this from evolve or did I get this from
Urban Outfitters oh boy ok now it amazes
its mates us this isn't from ASOS this
is from Free People oh no it's on if
this isn't from ASOS if you can't find
this one a system you like it it's from
revolve then and you probably won't like
it because it's really interesting I
don't even know if I like but I feel
like on it would be really cute if you
could wear it with the cool pair of
sneakers I'm like have your hair like
really cool and Trust it's like this
jean dress and I know it looks kind of
ugly but on it's dope like I promise I
don't I know you can't really trust me
through a screen or if you don't know me
or if you don't like my style then you
probably hate this but I'm like kind of
into like weird clothes lately
instead of like standard cute ones I'm
like kinda into the weird Jean like
flannel maxi dress by so maybe it's just
me but I really liked it so that's
everything that I got I oh no I got one
really cute thing from oh they wanted to
show you where this was from because it
looks again a little it's from Urban
Outfitters and it looks a little strange
here's the I'm like what is her fashion
it's like just long-sleeve dress and it
is so cute on I wore it with these
Golden Goose sneakers I'll show you the
shoes oh if you want to take inspiration
cuz these shoes are pretty expensive
I got me for my birthday last year but
they're so cute they're my favorite and
what I love about golden good shoes is
they have a little height in them like
built-in so it gives you an inch or two
which is nice for tiny people like me so
yeah that's everything for this clothing
haul I hope you guys enjoyed it and I'll
see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
