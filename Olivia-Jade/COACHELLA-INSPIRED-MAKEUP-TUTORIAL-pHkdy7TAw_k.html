I'm doing this
fun Coachella inspired makeup tutorial I
was just at Coachella last weekend and
it was absolutely incredible so if
you're going have the best time but if
you're looking for some inspiration for
a makeup look then I hope this helps you
yeah that's all yeah I hope you guys
enjoy it and let's get started first up
moisturizer I am using this oil-free
moisturizer by Neutrogena shaking a pump
of moisturizer and just apply not to my
face I'm not rubbing really hard I'm
just gonna die and Pat that in a little
bit so I feel let that moisturizer
settle into your skin I think it's a
great idea to prime your face I'm going
to be using my Smashbox photo finish
primer water and what I do with that is
I basically just spray this all over my
face just to prime my skin for the BB
cream or foundation or whatever we end
up using blue primer works best if you
let it set for a little bit like 5 or 10
minutes but I'm just going to collect
this cause it's a video and I don't want
to sit here and wait for Coachella it is
super hot in the desert it was about
like 90 degrees when I was there and the
days were burning hot like so off so
what I think you should do if you want
to put a base layer on a foundation
concealer not really it's a good
foundation or a BB cream or a CC cream
especially CC cream this is my number
one option in my go-to at Coachella
because it's lighter than a foundation
it's buildable for coverage and it still
has SPF in it
I go in with the it cosmetics CC cream
and it has an SPF of 50 couple swipes on
the face just kind of covering
everything and then just to blend that
out I'm gonna be taking my damp Beauty
Blender I suggest getting this wet it
makes it way easier and looks a lot more
natural to blend
but I like to do next is just conceal a
little bit my bags have been on fleek
there so it's on fleek still I think uh
hum they have been so purple and like
dark lately I think it's just because
like I literally got no sleep at
Coachella but I'm just taking my
Maybelline fit me concealer in the shade
20 which is a little bit lighter than my
natural skin color and I'm just pressing
it under in kind of a triangle really
light triangle though I'm not putting a
bunch on next I am going to be moving on
to brows I'm using my honest Asya brow
Wiz in the shade soft brown and I like
this just because it's an easy pencil so
I just kind of fill in the sparse spots
I'm not like shaping my I'm just
following the natural shape but I'm not
trying to shape them in any different
way and then I just gonna go right under
there
after I've done that I'm just setting my
brows in place so I'm not changing the
shape or trying to do anything except
set them like this now I'm just gonna go
onto the eyes for this I'm gonna be
taking my little black beauty book by
elf I love this book it is so affordable
and it has the most amazing shades
behind my eyes is my concealer test it
works and I'm lazy and then taking my
Beauty Blender you'll blend that up and
then what I'm doing is I'm just taking
those two right there these two mixing
them tapping off the excess I'm blending
out straight into the crease
after I've blended that into my crease
I'm just going to take a bronzy kind of
shimmer right in the top corner right
there and I'm just applying that all
over my lid but I'm actually gonna do
just for the sake of the video to get it
a little bit more pigmented is use mac
fix+ spray and just spray my brush of
mac fix+ by for helping the shadow be a
little bit more pigmented then i'm just
pressing that all over the lid and I'm
not really putting it in my crease but
all the way up to the crease you don't
want to go out and buy mac fix+ spray
but you want to get a look where it's
super shimmery like that eyedrops work
so as you can see I've blended those out
and it's just super bronzy and shimmery
and I'm just gonna go back in with the
first two shades we started with and
just kind of blend it out in the crease
to make it a little bit more intense I'm
just going to take the shade we put all
over the lid and just kind of drag that
on the lower lash line
I'm taking my Rimmel magnify eyes really
know what this is it's just a chocolate
brown liner and I'm just gonna low blow
the line my lower lash line my waterline
that's what it's called
I'm not smudging this right now just
simply lining my lower lashes
for some pop so I'm taking my liquid
eyeliner and just lining my top lashline
using my charts lights camera splashes
this is an amazing mascara for length
and volume so just doing a couple coats
cuddle oh my nose
that's what my lashes look like after
and then for my face I just want to kind
of overall bronze it up so I'm just
using this Milani baked bronzer this is
in this shade glow it's just this
beautiful drugstore bronzer and I'm just
gonna take this on a fan brush just a
giant fan brush and what I'm doing with
that is I'm kind of contouring with it a
little bit as you can see this fan brush
gives a nice contour and then just
blending it up kind of just blend
upwards kind of just around my face a
little bit just to warm my skin up I am
NOT a blush girl but boy do I love my
bronzer all around you know bronze
bronze okay now we're bronzed you know
just kind of glowing from within almost
I love this look I think it's really fun
I don't care if this shimmer is this
bronzer has shimmer in it I just adore
highlighting so I'm going in with my
honest Razia glow kit this is actually
my sister's and I'm just gonna mix I'm
gonna mix crushed pearl and mimosa so
these these two shades where my brush is
over like that and then oh yes mama
I'm gonna mix
for film would put a little moisturizer
on and then I'm just going to line my
lips with my favorite NYX lip liner in
the shade natural
then I'm just gonna go over top just in
the center I'm taking the new Too Faced
melted matte lips things in the color
child star and I just pop that right on
the center bony bubble is known for like
their face jewels you'll see at
Coachella
at least I saw everybody wearing them me
included so I'm just going to take this
out and see these little stickers you
don't have to individually apply them
that's what I think so cool you just
take this little thing off and then you
just peel it and put it right under so
I'm gonna please mind right there like
that and I think that is so fun and
Coachella
I don't know so that is it for the
completed Coachella inspired makeup
tutorial I really hope you guys all
enjoyed it I forgot to set my face with
powder didn't I but a thumbs up if you

gonna be so much fun and if you're not
going you're going to Lollapalooza or
