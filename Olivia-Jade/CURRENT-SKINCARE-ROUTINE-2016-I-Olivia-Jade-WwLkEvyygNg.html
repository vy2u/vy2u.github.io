y'all my skincare routine this is so
requested and I feel like when I used to
do these on YouTube I would talk about
all these excess products that I
sometimes use but then when I'm like
actually doing my skincare every day
nobody cares about the excess products
you guys want to know what I literally
use on an everyday basis how I keep my
skin clear what works for my skin so I'm
not going to show you all the excess
products I'm gonna show you guys my
daily products literally my rider dies
what I use every day for my skin care
disclaimer just because I know that my
skin care products are a little
expensive I want to say that like with
makeup when I'm saying I'm using
expensive products or anything um I can
always say like you can find them for
cheaper you can find dupes um personally
for me I have never found something this
good for skin care when always using
like clean and clear products and like
just other products before my skin was
breaking out and those are known to be
like good drugstore products but
personally for me my skin didn't respond
well if you guys want to help each other
out leave comments for affordable
products that are like life-changing for
you guys then you can totally do that
but this is what I'm using I'm not
trying to brag or show off or like look
at my expensive products but just
thought I would share that
I currently have no makeup on but if I
were to have makeup on I would have used
to remove it my Bioderma micellar water
this is bombed and it works really well
look really well to like take off your
makeup just cleanse you definitely can't
just take off all your makeup with this
- other waters only do so much
also if I have thicker makeup on but I
really need to get off I use my ponds
cold cream cleanser this stuff is so
good I love this but since it is kind of
like oily and like it's a cream formula
I don't use it all the time because
personally for me I just think don't
like that feeling on my skin what I use
every morning and every single night I
need to get more because I'm almost out
as you can tell by like the distorted
bottles I use the lancer skincare the
method polish for sensitive skin and i
use the method cleanse but polish is
like a bead exfoliator so it like really
gets down in your skin and then the
method it cleanses like a soft cleanser
i use both of these every morning and
every night that's why i'm like
basically out and this would probably
lasted me a couple months now so pretty
good and then i also use the method
Norrish for sensitive skin by Lancer and
it's just like a moisturizing cream and
it feels really soothing on your skin
and it's just like a really nice
lightweight moisturizer and I also want
to show you something that I have been
doing every single day it's so important
for your skin ever since I was growing
up my mom has told me to wear sunscreen
every single day just because this line
of skincare lanser products house worked
really really well for my skin I've just
been on like a Lancer beam this is not
sponsored this is the Lancer sunscreen
and it has SPF of 40 and I put this on
every single morning because I don't
want wrinkles and wearing sunscreen will
prevent wrinkles so if your mom or a
parent or guardian or anyone in your
life has never told you to wear
sunscreen everyday wear sunscreen every
day if you want youthful skin
y'all wonder everybody always asked is
your mom drink from the Fountain of
Youth
sunscreen also always make sure to
have a fresh clean towel to wipe my face
off
wash my face with warm water by the way
and now I am going to turn it to cold
and then wash my skin it so on my pores
close okay so after I have like cleaned
my skin and everything like that well
then go in with my moisturizer I also
forgot to mention one product hot Lancer
yay I basically live by this drying
cream it's a my Badescu drying lotion I
just put it on my chin so I kind of
breakout there so that is it for my
skincare routine what I do to keep my
skin clear I'm not saying I'm expert in
any of this so I just took off the
drying cream for the outro and not
sixteen on my face but I'm not saying
I'm an expert with skincare or literally
anything like that I'm just telling you
guys what works for me but as for these
all the time so I just showed you what I
used but thank you so much for watching
and I'll see you guys next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
