market hi puppy she don't even know she
wasn't what is on her relief I just
wanted to give you a little update on
what's going on with the vlogs so
instead of daily vlogging I'm gonna do
like every other day or maybe a few
times a week or something not every day
just because I can't vlog every single
day it's way too draining for me
personally I know some people can do it
but I discovered I am NOT one of them
it's the weekend
it's Friday happy Friday I think I have
a few days of footage in this vlog so
I'm probably gonna be doing a lot of
weekly vlogs from like little clips from
different days a lot of you guys
suggested that and then I'm gonna do
some daily vlogs - Dave vlogs whatever
vlogs are still happening that's what
matters I know you guys love the vlogs
