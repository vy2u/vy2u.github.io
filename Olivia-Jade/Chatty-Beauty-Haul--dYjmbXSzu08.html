today I have a huge beauty makeup haul
I've got it in this box here of all the
products that I want to show you so some
of it is unboxing kind of like taking
out of the package and some of it I've
already opened and tried and swatched
and all that fun stuff
um this is always really requested to do
hauls and I love shopping for makeup and
that's kind of where I like to splurge
on makeup and skincare there are so many
dupes to these products if you don't
feel like going out and buying them you
can look up reviews and dupes and all of
these whatever you want to see but I'm
not really going to go into depth about
what the products are like and all that
kind of stuff I'm really just going to
talk about what I got and if I tried it
or if I haven't tried it out yet so most
of this is lip products like lip ease
and lipsticks and lip glosses and stuff
like that but I have some face blushes
primer cleaners whatever and that since
this is a collective haul this has been
bought over a period of time so if you
have seen these in my favorites videos
from June or something where you've seen
me talk about these before it's because
I have them for a little bit so some of
this is new up to two days ago on some
of it is old from about three weeks ago
so without further ado let's jump right
into the video and I hope you guys all
enjoy it I'm going to start with
something that I love and I just got it
and it's pretty new but it is so handy
it's my liquid blender cleanser it's
just a beauty blender cleanser so what I
do is I pump this out on my Beauty
Blender and then I wash it with some
water I sounded like I couldn't speak
then I wash my Beauty Blender with water
and this and it's cleaned it takes up
all the product and I think I talked
about this my favorites but it's just
good so you don't get acne from the
blender next my Smashbox photo finish
primer water oh love this stuff it's
fairly new I don't know where I put the
cap I take this everywhere with me I
wish they had it in a smaller bottle
it's probably a sample size you should
probably look into that because I
literally just take this everywhere
me it's first off it leaves your skin
just kind of glowing if you're not even
wanting to wear makeup and you just kind
of spray this on your face you're
looking glowy and dewy and nice and
fresh then on top of that it makes your
makeup last when you put a foundation
over it but it still kind of has that
glowy doing this it's not made for that
but I just I just find since it is a
liquid it leaves my skin dewy and wet
looking which I love I have not applied
this um I have a lot of highlight going
on but I did not use this under the
foundation because I've just put all
this on to film a video so yeah love of
love it's amazing this is all just so
random I don't even know where to start
I picked up the hello flawless EXO
benefit powder in the color beige this
is a bit older but I really haven't used
it because I got way too dark of a color
so it kind of looks like a light bronzer
and that's kind of what I've been using
it for just to warm up my cheeks a
little bit I think this will be a good
bronzer when I'm even paler when winter
rolls around because my skin tends to be
a little more fair during that time so I
think then this will be a really nice
in-between kind of skin tone bronzy
color but right now as I get darker I
think it's going to work by the end of
the summer I will be able to use this as
a powder so I'll try to get use out of
that and then I'll use it as a bronzer I
really like it though I've noticed from
what I've used it definitely allows my
makeup to side place so I might go pick
up a lighter version because I got way
too dark
thanks let me just talk about the most
amazing foundation I've ever laid my
eyes on flash try its the giorgio armani
luminous silk foundation hold on okay so
first it has a pump so a plus for me if
you have a pump then you just make life
so much easier
ah what I love about this foundation is
it looks like second skin it doesn't
look caked on it doesn't look powdered
on it doesn't look like you're wearing a
ton of makeup it just looks so natural
and you can start with the smallest
amount and then build it up and it still
won't look cakey I
usually do one pump or half a pump for
one side of my face oh yeah like won't
pump for the whole thing and it works so
well
skin looks flawless it's beautiful it
evens the skin tone out I ordered this
online and I'm in the shade too and it
came like last week and I've already
used so much I was going to do a first
impressions video but I couldn't wait I
just wanted to use it a second I got it
so I literally got in the mail and then
I put it on my face and walked out the
door and I don't wear foundation
everyday I just really wanted to try out
the product and man I'm obsessed with it
it smells good actually I hate
foundations I have like a weird sight to
them and this just smells normal to like
a good scent if anything I don't have
any complaints about this foundation
except that it's so expensive it's so so
pricey but I would buy it all over again
because I just really think it's worth
it I got the Anasazi of Beverly Hills
brow wiz no no it's a clear brow gel and
this just sets your brows in place I
really like it I have it in my browser
now I don't have any product in my brows
right now I didn't like fill them in but
I just kind of you know took this comb
them out and yeah it works obviously
works really well I like it a lot and
that's a lot to say although a lot of
this is high-end not everything is
high-end so I'm talking about the Milani
baked blush is that I picked it up that
I picked it up that I picked up in three
different shades the first is delicioso
pink and I've already unwrapped this one
but I haven't used it yet and it's just
this really really vibrant pink and it's
so bright oh I thought the whole blush
came out it was just a little brush um
I guess under it is a little brush how
cute I also got it in the shade coralina
which is kind of like a marble um
product so it has some reds and then
some shimmery whites and I haven't even
opened this one yet and it's in the
shade coralina as I just said and I'm
really excited to try that let's open it
that was beautiful
oh my gosh that's so pretty
lastly in the shade Dolce pink I've had
just blush before I just repacked it up
and it's already really dirty oh it's so
pretty I love that it's in the shade
Doge I think I've said all the colors
like three times breath never okay so
that's that I also picked up the laura
mercier secret brightening powder in the
shade one so i love this it I use it to
just power my white translucent powder
and I did not shut it all the way you
need to show this all the way or you
will be a powdery mess it sets your eyes
and brightens them all that good stuff
so I got this I realized that this has
become more of a review but I just like
kind of sounds like a favorites video
but it's a haul slash my opinion if I've
used it already and that is so good next
I want to talk about the Jessie's Girl
liquid glass lip gloss I have them in
that's a Revlon one I have these in
quite a few shades here the first one is
this neon or CH what is this yes like
pinky orange color and it's called
cherry bomb the next one is this bright
red here and it's in the shade melodrama
it's kind of like an orange II red this
is like a deep red and it's called
scarlet fever this one is called sunset
kits and it's like a sparkly light pink
and this one is looks like it's going to
be super opaque along with most of them
except this one Suns get sunsets kiss
sunset kiss looks like it will kind of
be like a topped off color like to put
it on top of something that's more
opaque because this looks like it would
be a little transparent and it's called
a razzle dazzle this pink pink one it's
pretty easy to apply I like how it has
the dome applicator I think these are
always easier to apply like the formula
it's creamy it's a little bit sticky but
these are literally worn like I think 2
bucks or something really inexpensive I
just got them at riding so honestly
they're that cheap then
I'm okay with them being sticky that's
they're so cheap I picked up my but what
are these the Revlon Colorstay ultimate
lip glosses liquid lipstick so they also
have the same type of applicator and I
love the formula of these ones the first
one is in the shade
0:30 miracle which is a sparkly pink I
usually like matte lip colors or even if
they're glossy I just don't like when
they're shimmers in them but I wanted to
give this a shot anyway I haven't tried
these yet this is in ultimate orchid
0:06
which is just a really nice lilac kind
of color and the last one also is a
little bit of sparkles in it it's in
0:40 brilliant for dogs really kind of
purply reddish sparkly color which looks
very holiday Christmassy kind of so next
from the drugstore I have my NYX soft
matte lip creams the first one is in the
shade Tokyo which just is a light pink
and I'm showing you this because I got
it but now I'm going to be honest I love
the NYX lip butters creams whatever
these are
I like the matte ones I like the butter
creams I love them or the butter glosses
I love them all this specific shade
Tokyo is a really really nice light pink
and I love the color maybe I just kind
of oh maybe I just kind of got like the
bad one but this one does wasn't even
creamy it was brand new I opened it up
and it was just just dead it wasn't even
a product anymore like it's literally
just a little you put it on your lips
and even though they are matte lip
creams it just goes on automatically
just dry and crumbly and it doesn't have
like a full thing so I don't fits this
color specifically um I like this one
it's in Copenhagen and it's just this
deep purplish red these are hard to
apply I'm going to be honest but once
you got the application down this color
is beautiful if you're into bold colors
next I have some BH Cosmetics stuff I
have the glitter collection loose
glitter and
this one here these two here actually
are packaged but the other ones are not
I took them out of the box it just for
the hell of it um so this is navy blue
which i think is beautiful oh it's
beautiful it's in the shade sapphire and
just loose glitter for your eyes
obviously I also got it in the shade
black just a black it's called black
it's just black loose glitter so this
has a ton of Fallout I haven't tried
these two shades yet but one of my
favorites is the BH Cosmetics BH
Cosmetics be a cosmetics glitter
collections glitter in the shade gold
this is what I wore in my April
favorites and everybody requests it for
me to do a makeup tutorial in it I
literally just use the shade and then a
bunch of mascara a little thin line of
eyeliner and then just firmly how I use
my face makeup this is my favorite shade
the thing with this is it's kind of hard
to work with it has fall out falls in
your face so don't do your foundation
first any kind of glittery product is
going to do that so that is in the shade
gold and I also have it in two more
shades this one is called pearl which is
a really shimmery white and then in the
shade baby Bank which is a really
beautiful pink also for cheap makeup I
got another one of the Maybelline master
glazes blush stick in the shade make
them off it's not opening this is a
beautiful shade then metalia I have this
kind of blood thick the same product in
a different shade
I don't know color it is in but they are
amazing so I just picked up another one
in the shade make them off you probably
hear about this in my favorites if I
like it and if I don't like it you
probably won't hear about it
you want me to a first impression with
this give this video a thumbs up if you
guys want to pull face up first
impressions and then I'll do that also
for drugstore makeup this is the wet and
wild lipstick and the shade at sugarplum
fairy this private eye open is a really
beautiful cranberry hard it's like a
cranberry purplish reddish kind of
more purpley cranberry very autumn
winter fall kind of color dark beautiful
love it can't wear it because I wear lip
colors like this in the summer and I
don't really care that is everything for
drugstore and to finish off with a few
more high-end products I know this has
been very sporadic you like started out
with high-end winter drug sure back to
high-end sorry that's just how I was
pulling out but you guys can still see
what I got I'll have everything linked
down below I'll have a section I'll have
a drugstore and then a high-end section
in the description box and then list
everything from each so it's a bit
easier for you guys to navigate but for
here I'm just kind of showing products
so I hope you don't mind
next I was just out Sephora and I picked
up two buxom full-on lip creams the
first one is in the shade white Russian
I talked about this on my channel a
while back I used to have the shade well
I thought I lost it but I was just
looking through my makeup and I found it
so now I have two of them I might give
it to my film if I already have the
shade since I found it after I thought
I'd lost I'll probably give it to my
sister just because it's a very neutral
pink and I like it a lot and I think she
would too
or my mom whoever wants it one of the
one of the first lip glosses that I
actually got when I started my channel I
remember buying this when I started my
channel the next one is called mudslide
which I have not tried out yet but I'm
so excited to try out it's a really
pretty like reddish pinky oh it's so
pretty I like these because they're
plumping and they sting when you put
them on your lips but it's kind of a
funny feeling so yeah this isn't the
shade mudslide and it is a really nice
pink reddish kind of like ready oh not
orange red pink what do you call that
mauve not really a mauve them you catch
my drift
next from Sephora I also picked up the
Too Faced melted liquid long-wear
lipsticks I have to the shade a melted
Newt just the nude shade on my lips
right now these are by far my favorite
lip lip everything I've ever used
if these ever get discontinued I would
probably cry because I have never tried
something so amazing
my lips they are pricey they are
high-end they're from two-faced but for
me I love my lip step and this is all
worth it to me so I have the shade nude
on my lips right now which is a
beautiful nude kind of like a darker
nude and then I also picked up the shade
melted sugar which is a light pink nude
which is beautiful as well I have the
shade melted berry which is like a berry
color and it is gorgeous and then I also
have the shade Chihuahua which is a
pinkish mauve color and all of these are
amazing they're all so pigmented they go
on so creamy and they dry matte and they
don't feel dry when you go like that
it's not sticky
honestly A+ for these the formula
everything about them is amazing they're
so easy to apply as well because they
have this kind of tip here it's like a
spongy applicator I can't explain it but
it's so easy to apply you kind of
squeeze it and then it comes to the top
so I don't think I've tried
chew a yet yeah I haven't I'm starting
to you can see at the surface but it
just kind of comes like a white tip at
first and then when you squeeze it up
and you apply it on your lips it turns
the color of the lip gloss obviously
these are my favorite I love so if you
don't have these and you just want a
really beautiful basic kind of dark nude
get melted nude because it is amazing or
get sugar or melted sugar they're like
the melted collection but they're
actually called sugar nude Chihuahua
berry if you guys know who Jaclyn hill
is or you watch her videos she made a
highlight called champagne pop for
backup cosmetics and they did not have
her shade at Sephora so I ordered three
of them online but whatever because it's
limited edition but I was in the Bekaa
section because I was looking for it and
I came across two beautiful highlights
the first one is in the shade opal which
is just gorgeous
let's open it Oh opal is this really
pretty shimmery pink No
it's not big it's pretty much a white
kind of goldish yellow undertone but not
yellow it's pretty much straight up
white it is stunning I have it on my
cheekbones along with some other
highlighting stuff it's on me and there
and I love it it's so pigmented it's a
powder but it's not like cakey or gross
or kind of anything like that and it's
just a beautiful beautiful color so this
one hello you can kind of see the color
when it's tilted like that this is the
most beautiful
pinkish gold highlight it's in the shade
rose gold it's pretty much a rose gold
with a strong strong strong pinky rose
undertone you can see it kind of
perfectly when it's tilted like that and
this kind of makes it look lighter dark
let dark light dark light dark light
dark is it love both of these I don't
have much to say because I just kind of
recently picked these up from like two
days ago and I'm just trying to try them
out but what I know is that they are so
pigmented and some of the best
highlighters that I've ever used
especially the shade opal I kind of
would use this becca rose gold
shimmering skin perfecter pressed powder
that's what they're called I would use
the shade rose gold more as like a
shimmer blush and a highlight if I want
a really pink highlight but for just a
beautiful highlight on top of a blush or
a pink color how to use this oh not put
rose gold on top of the pink or Goldy
blush already because then that would
just be like so colorful and so pink
somebody might throw up that is it for
my Moses just a huge makeup haul and so
I was kind of sporadic as I said I will
have drugstore and then all of this
stuff and then high-end all the stuff
