me I'm faculties your channel I'm an
awful person I haven't posted in so long
um I've really felt a lack of
inspiration I didn't know what I wanted
to do and then I realized what I loved
doing most on my channel is just sitting
down and talking so I thought I have to
get ready right now to go out and so I'm
going to do everyday makeup so I said
why not film it and then while I'm doing
that why don't I do like a chitchat get
ready with me so I can kind of update
you guys on what's been going on with my
life nothing and say nothing crazy
nothing too interesting but for those of
you that's just been wondering like
where have you been or you've just been
wanting a new video here it is I hope
you guys enjoy it and let's get started
I literally haven't posted in so long if
I sound kind of like it's because I'm
sick and the ears are keeping my hair in
my face while I do my makeup so so much
is going on right now I just have like
my little pouch this is a really
spontaneous video because I haven't
posted a really long time and I feel so
awful so I just had to do my makeup
we'll talk about where I've been what's
been going on all that kind of stuff
this really isn't going to be dramatic
or smokey or this is going to be like
daily flawless base don't flawless oh
like still freckles and like blemishes
kind of are coming through it's just
supposed to be everyday makeup kind of
what I do now everyday it's kind of like
a chitchat get ready with me everyday
makeup thing so uh what do we even talk
about where do I even start
I haven't posted in a couple weeks and
then prior to that I have been really
off and on with my posting more off not
so much gone which has just been really
really crappy on my part considering I
make a promise to post on this channel
and I need to like you know stay with
that um this isn't coming
now I'm using the it cosmetics CC cream
by the way and it's literally with my
favorite things what I've noticed
because it doesn't really come on you
know when you make a promise to do
something you should probably stick with
it especially just so many loyal people
and speaking of loyal people I hit
40,000 subscribers what what a wicked
shot was probably one of the most
exciting things and that's what I like
really just said to myself right now get
your act together and film you don't
have excuses you've been in your bed
watching videos so it's time to film and
I don't know what to say I'm so sick but
uh as you can hear but youtube is one of
like my favorite things like I just love
it considering like I've made my own
channel I'm really committed to my
channel and really sorry if it doesn't
really seem that way anymore I love
everybody here and I'm really grateful
for the support that you guys
continuously give me even when I
disappeared uh means a lot so I promise
to be better I say that every video but
I really really promise this time that
I'm going to really get my act together
just to lighten up the ah so to use a
lighter concealer by Maybelline it's the
fit me concealer and I'm shoulda put a
little under my eyes
this isn't everyday look it's not
dramatic at all so that CC creams really
light and it has SPF in it so I think my
nope it has SPF of 50 + so I'm just
taking this and kind of dabbing that
what else I have just been like really
stressed too um a new level I don't know
what I'm even stressed about but you
know that just like constant feeling of
stress that's me
and yeah I don't know what also to get
you up on I'm really thankful for all
40,000 either that's really really
exciting um
so after we blend that all out obviously
my skin is not flawless there's still a
lot of you know blemishes and freckles
and like natural stuff coming through
and I like that I don't like the cakey
look I think a lot of people think that
in my everyday life I like to keep my
face up which is just so not the case I
literally never wear makeup and also a
lot of people like to comment like like
oh how do you like keep your skin so
good you wear so much makeup and I
really don't write how much makeup I the
only time you see me and makeup is on my
videos so think about that and like
special events and stuff or like if I'm
going out I never wear makeup to school
I literally don't put announce makeup on
in the morning so I'm just warming up my
cheeks by the way like a really slight
contour and it's basically all I really
want to do warm up my jaw I bring it
down my neck and my forehead I've been
really into chokers for a while and I
just really love them so that's why you
probably see like a bunch of different
colors on my neck in these videos but
I'm kind of into these colored ones and
I just got them off of Amazon for like
super cheap anyway I'm using this NIC
cream blush in the shade natural
essential my friend natural look and I
am just putting it on my cheeks I see a
lot of youtubers bring it up all the way
up here and I just don't know if really
they should about what I just watched
them and then I kind of started
discovered for myself that who naturally
has a bunch of color on lamp here like
if you're you know and then I'm not
private doing anything this is literally
the most basic look I'm just taking my
hoola bronzer and this Sigma tapered
blending brush tapping off the excess
and just to finding my crease a little
bit you're really going to get my brows
done as well it looks so gross
okay one boy blend
I'm just gonna bring that all over my
lid as well I'm taking this Sigma
diffused crease diffused crease wrap
crease brush yeah and I'm just taking
the shade milk chopped I shall let you
fall to caramel it's kind of like a
brownie Randa Sh
I'm just kind of blending that into the
crease and all the lid just like that
but I doing like a really subtle version
of just all Brown matte and now I just
love doing that looks and I just to
finish it off for me one of you guys
this is so basic I'm just putting some
chapstick on oh I need some sort of not
care about don't I don't have it here
let's just do a really thin line of
liner on my top lash line
can't see what I'm doing I'm using my
monumental Sigma lash mascara Chi's are
so good they make you think you might
look like a few different mascaras and
they're all so freakin good and I should
get my lower lash line also what I do
what I do is have some excess like
mascara I just kind of blend it into my
crease so yeah this isn't my everyday I
kind of just chilled makeup look this is
a quick video but it was just kind of an
update talked with me I love you guys I
promise we better about posting if I'm
not posting or anything feel free to bug
me on Twitter um I just remind me being
