face then I'm just gonna get started
what am I even saying oh my I just went
backwards and crossed and everything
that shouldn't happen hey guys it's
Olivia and welcome back to my channel
today I'm filming my current beauty
favorites / February beauty favorites
whatever you guys like to call this
video I know the lip colors a little bit
crazy we're just gonna keep going with
it because I think I'm liking it but I'm
not really sure I'm liking it so we're
just gonna see if I like it okay so if
you guys do want to see the current
Beauty favorites of February that I have
been loving what did that make sense
wait process current favorites very good
I've been loving not really I mean like
maybe if you think about it it makes
kind of sense but we're going to redo it
if you guys do want to see it the video
and what I've been loving for the month
of February then just keep watching
first favorite is an oldie but a goodie
actually went on a time span evading
this product and it's the hoola bronzer
my benefit it's just a like light milk
chocolate color that sounds really
repulsive when I say it like that I'm
still not the biggest fan of it for
bronzing but it looks so good and so
natural and it gives you the best
contour line I've never used a better
product for contouring in my life hmm
maybe that's not true I've been using it
a lot this month and then I realized how
much I liked it I'm really tempted I
really want to hit pan on this also I've
never hit pan on a product fun fact
next favorite is also a bronzing
highlighting blush product it's the
Bobbi Brown shimmer brick in the color
bronze I feel like I've put this in a
favorites video before but I don't
really remember so here we are again it
has white then a little pink then some
gold then some pink and then a dark
purplish brown color and it looks really
nice I have it on my cheeks right now if
you put too much product on it's super
easy to blend out it's very blendable I
tend to put way too much blush on my
face at times just because I'm like oh
not enough not enough and then I look at
the mirror oh my god
that's enough kind of just melts into
your face which seems weird it doesn't
melt it just is very good
as I said a thousand next for face
product recently been loving NARS sheer
glow foundation I'm the color goby but I
don't want foundation all the time but
when I do I think this is a great one
because it's a light coverage and I'm
definitely gonna have to get a darker
shade in the summer time because I am
not gonna be this light anymore
rats space product is this foundation
primer in hydrating it's by Laura
Mercier it feels like if you can't have
your face and then foundation and you
need a barrier in between your
foundation and your face this is really
nice it's very light how I'm moving on
to lips I'm just jumping every I don't
even really know what I'm doing but I'm
just gonna go for it first lip gloss
Singh stick it's unbelievable how
spastic I am it blows my mind it's
actually mind blowing okay next product
is my buxom lipgloss in White Russian I
feel like I've also put this in my video
a really long time ago or maybe I just
wore it in a video really long time ago
I don't really remember but basically
buxom is a pumping lipgloss and then it
starts to sting a little bit but it's
not painful you can just feel it kind of
tingling and feeling it kind of sink
into your lips which sounds weird but
it's nice so it's been a fave next I've
been loving this next soft matte lip
cream in the color
copenhague you want to get it and once
you get this spot on it is so good and
the color payoff I mean the only problem
I have with it is it doesn't last that
long which is kind of annoying so lastly
for lips which has been my favorite ever
since it came two days ago it's actually
came last night my MAC lipstick I was
gonna save this for favorites in the
future video but I didn't because I used
it so much already
I know it's a favorite so this is the
MAC lipstick in cyber in the satin
collection and I have it on my lips
right now I know this is not everybody's
taste I hated dark lipstick for the
longest time when I first got into
makeup I know it's kind of daring and
bold and dark and crazy and it might be
a little scary to you
you might think that I look pretty cool
is it is it possible to have like a
reflex where you just drop things like
your hand can't grasp onto it and then
it just goes home and like falls on your
hand is that possible because if that's
possible about some disease or if that's
some issue or some reflex problem I have
it I know I have it I don't even need to
be tested just give me the medication so
I can hold things in my hand because
it's really frustrating but if it's not
your cup of tea don't worry I have a
glass of water that was funny right it
probably wasn't but I think it was funny
okay next thing I turn lights cameras
splashes mascara and this is a fave from
a long time ago but it works really well
it makes your lashes super thick black
very dark and black and it gives them a
ton of length the only problem I have
with this is because of the consistency
and like the wetness of it it does
smudge very easily when you first apply
it to your top lashes it will kind of
get on the eyelid but you can easily
clean that up now I'm back on this
because a my Too Faced one is missing
and B I forgot how good this is best for
beauty and lastly for makeup this Stila
in the light eyeshadow palette on my
eyes right now I have the color kit okay
Olivia :
and reflex problems I called it eye a
reflex problem they are very pigmented
so reflex problems I'm telling you it's
the reflex problems lastly for beauty
products which is not makeup but it is
beauty it's this desert essence blemish
touch stick don't know the price of it
but whatever it is it is totally worth
it if you have a blemish you just put
this right on top of the smallest amount
of it I will try to have it linked down
below if I can find it because I'm not
even kidding it's the greatest thing
I've ever used I feel like it has magic
powers in it it's magic yo I hope you
guys all enjoyed and let me know down
below if you guys have any suggestions
or favorites for me to try out I have a
quick question have any of you guys used
Russia's bath bombs before because I
really want to try them out I haven't
tried them yet apparently makes
bathtub look like Disney Land / worlds
came and lived in it but anyway just let
me know if they stain your bathtub
because my bathtub is pure white and how
am i old and I don't know if those lush
bath bombs stain because I have heard
that they do so let me know make sure
