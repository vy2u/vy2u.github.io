today's video I am doing my current
favorite slash commandment April
favorites slash last night favorites
basically just talking to you guys about
a couple of my fashion favorites a bunch
of skincare beauty and what I've just
been loving these past couple months and
I was on one of these in a while I have
so many new products I wanted to share
with you guys as always I will have
direct links down below with super easy
three lines to find but with that being
said let's get started
also I'm really sorry I'm my voice kind
of sounds like a man and a little rusty
is a little sexy oh really but how am I
walked about Coachella and it was so fun
meeting all you guys playing so if we
did take a photo please tweet me that
because I'm creating a scrapbook where I
meet all my subscribers and like the
photos we take just so it's fun to look
back on so I would love to include our
photos and scrapbook but with all that
being said let's excited and I hope you
enjoy so I'm going to start with fashion
favorites since I only have two pairs of
shoes the first pair are these really
great sandals they're by the brand Ray
but I got some more evolved I will put a
link down below fast and so find them
but I just love the color I think it's
so fun for the summer and spring time
especially since it is so warm where
eyelid but I'm just kind of living for
these shoes and just like a really
pretty florescent like oranjee red and
yeah you can basically see what they
look like they are so comfortable like
they just feel like super salt like it's
a cushionless it's really weird even it
looks like you know a cushiony material
but I absolutely love them I think they
look great with like an all-white outfit
something just to bring a pop of color
to your spring summer outfit and
supposed to be wandering m57 and they
fit perfectly so they run true to size 4
shirt
excuse only little baby hairs they're
just always lying
ok so my next pair of shoes let's make
my wallet crying tiny bit and I know I
don't normally show really fun stuff in
my favorites video since the point of
this video is supposed to be like was on
the point of the videos portable fell
for you guys know I usually like to but
I don't feel like since I didn't get
this no money I really want to show you
I really wanted you guys to do
see them because they're great and
they're great for summer and they're so
in right now so we use our rag-and-bone
light mules I got them also cuneta
portray ink or maybe Barney's I will
link them down below they are expensive
I'm not going to tell you oh they're
portable they're cheap enough they're
very expensive shoes but they are so
worth it and they may be decimal you
have like 40 on I totally get it fashion
and skincare beauty is and not what you
splurge on maybe it's like games or
whatever your thing is
but for me it's fashion I picked up a
little bit of a money to get these after
I followed my good friends Lauren
Elizabeth put them in her ear also
thanks for my wall I hate you but I love
you
I hope so they are amazing they're so
comfortable they're so cute for the
spring and summer I just I don't even
know they're just so pretty I think
they're just like the greatest cutest
most amazing comfortable shoe and I'm
satisfied where this in the spring and
summer it could look great with like
wrist wear them jeans with white jeans
you could do like a little cream outfit
you could do with a cute dress a cute
little denim skirt so there's so many
ways to wear these shoes okay so now to
dive into a skincare and beauty and
makeup and my favorites also for those
of you ask you for a hair care routine I
am going to show you what I use so thank
you basically I want to start with skin
care I think I mentioned this in a
favorites videos it's the only product
I've mentioned in a favorites video a
long long time ago but this was in a
favorites video from so long ago that I
didn't think I had enough to thousand
subscribers and a lot of people would
have missed it so I do want to put it
back in since I've been using it all the
time and not many people probably saw
that video this is my renewed hope in a
jar micro renewal hydrating mist it's by
philosophies and it is so good I'm gonna
it smells so good and it just refreshes
your face this is something I would love
to take on vacation I love to do my
makeup I have a makeup i prime my face
with this it's not only a primer but you
don't like to give great hydration
your skin I just the thing with the
admission stuff I never noticed that my
face is like oh my god a whole new thing
but it just like in the moment feels
really good and I also notice my makeup
doesn't go on dry so I think it should
pick a great little essential to your
primer or moisturizer or whatever it's
not like the only thing I knew but I
really love it it smells amazing it
refreshes your skin like so wonderfully
I love this product
so I've been absolutely loving this this
is the Clinique take a day off cleansing
long mr. Minnis all your makeup so
easily it's kind of like a buttery
consistency and it's incredible I love
it love it love it so basically you just
rub it all over your face and then wash
it off you honestly don't even need to
like use another cleanser opportunist
that's what I loved about it with my
lifesaver at Coachella because I was
wagered are like do my regular skin care
routine so I love theirs it's great it
takes em across super easily marks with
mascara included so just a plus
so for moisturizer if you have dry skin
this is the best thing in the whole
entire world this is the it cosmetics
confidence in a cream this is a
transforming no gender cream and
literally it transforms your skin as you
can see I've used a lot of it on the
whole top of it but I'm going to
probably buy a thousand more I even got
my sister off in it she said she has
like red bumps on your skin and it
completely got rid of all the bumps on
her skin so absolutely great I just love
it for like dry skin or before supply
makes fun I've been using this like
everytime before swimming home because
it's so thick and hydrating that it just
completely informed your skin from like
super dry and like slinky to like really
smooth and cleaned out so you might have
seen just a couple times before you feel
like a real result but my sister had dry
skin and like red bumps and they're
completely gone and she loves it and
it's all because of this
tight enough good things about this
product not one badly not one so the two
ice-creams I also have it cosmetics
confidence in an eye cream this is
amazing as well it has like a little bit
of a different consistency maybe a
little bit thicker but it is so good if
your computer dries up under your eyes
and you know if you have like flakes you
meet eye cream I never knew that when I
might concealer would never go on like
smooth but it's because you need a
really good eye cream so I definitely
recommend it cosmetics confidence in
Turkey my cream or the paraffin eyes
it's potent eye cream this is also
amazing I would say the benefit one
definitely is less thick so it's a
little bit lighter on the skin so necro
skincare I have been obsessed with this
sky body butters I don't know why this
is kinda gross but I think I joined the
reptile family I one day I woke up and
my leg I look like a snake and I'm
Cameron was like wow did you join the
reptile family did you for your sake
well yes but anyways this kind of saved
it it's all a bit of meat a really good
moisturizer but I love a body butter
because it's super thick this smells
really fresh so that's what I love about
it it's so amazing it smells really good
kind of tongue would recommend it so it
made me not maybe just become a human
again
basically so love that I'm going to go
onto haircare before jumping to makeup
all of you guys are always asking what
the heck do I do for you a pillared
conditioner and all of that so I'm going
to show you if my mom taught me anything
it's splurge on skin care and hair care
she never taught me to purchase on shoes
but I guess my jealous out on a my own
how this is expensive not going to lie I
again will link it down below in all of
this off of Amazon but if you have thick
hair you need it if your hair is
constantly tangled it's dry if you dye
it and it's just kind of like falling
apart you need it it's like the best
hair care that like repair your hair
basically not alright for the shampoo I
use the or eBay gold left repair and
restore shampoo were be
I don't know how to pronounce it I think
it's very high yeah but so this is a
sure proof and then it also has the or
even gold must repair and restore
conditioner and that's the Bissell plank
so it's in a pretty decent sized bottle
it does take a little while to get
through and I use a lot of conditioner
but I also have been loving the gold
last transformative mask this shock to
you babe because this thing completely
changed my hair and just makes it so
soft you can just let it fit however you
want and then rinse it out I like
printing out the cold water and then
brushing through my hair feel so so soft
and smooth I actually love getting out
of the shower putting this in my hair
putting the hair to shower top and then
just like walking around for like 30
minutes doing my own thing just so it
really kind of works into my hair
because my hair is so thick that is
always dead and cuz I diet so those
three things I'm just saving my life I
know they're expensive but I was using
drugstore a hair care stuff for a very
long time and then my hair stylist I've
had my hair was like that doesn't really
work to me something that's actually
good for your hair so this brand is
incredible but now if you want something
that is from the director and a little
bit more affordable this stuff is
amazing this is the nor shink coconut
milk anti breakage serum okay this is
from the drugstore I had no face off
reminder stylist told me about dressing
I had no faith in drugstore products for
hair and then I came across this and it
changed my life so basically after again
i - our ajumma shampoo and conditioner
with my or ebay stuff I just put this in
my hair sometimes Oh everyday but ever
if I'm feeling like my hair needs a
little bit of hydration this just makes
my nerves so small so small stuff it
makes my hair so smooth this off it
literally like when I was feeling my
hair wet it dry because using my hair
dries a little bit puffy since it is so
thick this just made it feel like so
smooth so finally now on to makeup I
have a couple of products I'm just going
to go through this quickly because I
don't want to bore you and I think this
has been
while already that's okay so this
foundation I know that everyone has been
talking about these but I've just
started using them they're the Tarte
rainforest of the sea foundations I have
mine in light medium neutral but when I
one right now in tan and then they're
light neutral one I'm fair so confident
summer spring is time here this spring
but until the summer I've been using my
Taylor one basically this foundation it
doesn't feel like you have anything on
your face like I have it on right now
and I don't feel like I'm wearing any
foundation I think it is because it's a
water foundation so since it is
water-based and it's super super
lightweight some build it up super super
high coverage and you can keep it super
super natural so it just has a little
stick you push this in and then it comes
on like droplets but I just like take
the stakes and fuss - Aria - let's go
like that no I mean I love it it's great
it looks so natural with J and I
seriously recommend it it's beautiful
for the summer time also has an SPF of
15 I think yes okay so next for makeup
this little blush husband so beautiful
this is the color pop super shock cheek
in the shade birthday suit it's just
this really gorgeous cream blush I think
it just gets a really really nice flush
of color to the cheeks and looks super
natural I've been obsessed with applying
it it was like a little stippling brush
because it just makes it look it just
gives it like a light weight but it's
like a perfect brush to apply this so
this is my real technique is link brush
I love buying it with that and it just
could pick the prettiest wash of colors
so it also for drugstores off like
affordable makeup this is the Physicians
Formula butter bronzers it smells like
kind of smells like that really good
tropical sunscreen I don't know how to
explain it but it just is like the most
gorgeous bronze shade I've been
constantly reaching for this this month
like I don't know what to do if I don't
happen I just look like I love applying
with just like a huge brush and it's
like kind of more crazy on my face of it
you are a little bit
our fair it's going to be a really great
barometer for you it's actually it's
like a bronzer not like mud and if you
are a little bit darker I probably won't
use this if you're an orphan but if you
have like medium to light skin this
would look really really pretty on you
so for my skin it looks great so if you
kind of the same complexion as me I
seriously recommend this it's so pretty
smell good and it's cheap so what next I
have to talk about these these are my
favorites lashes ever these are the
ardell demi wispies in black but these
are the natural dumb you would speak you
how to make sure in order then I were
written down below my cat's milk Amazon
you choose the natural ones there are
the perfect lash so if you're like me I
am gone right now if you're like me and
you hardly wear false lashes I think
these are the previous ones you can cut
them make someone more fluttery on the
outsides don't use an inner corner i use
like most of the full trip today
but what i love is you don't need to cut
them they're kind of perfect for the eye
length but i select always cut them a
little bit looks a little bit more
natural but the length is really pretty
so onto different person i see other
youtubers and beauty groups put these
gorgeous fluttery lashes on like the
lily lash and wherever and it looks so
pretty on everyone like i'm like an owl
or than they look great and then i put
them on and they're just so big that it
makes my eyes look real like i
understand how to look so good on
everyone else except me I don't get it
and then I found these and there's this
be perfect laughs so if you can't feel
that way if sometimes those huge lashes
are just a little bit too much for you
these ones are amazing the only glue I
use is the duo glue in clear next I want
to talk about to let products the first
one is this into a essential lip
enhancer I have had the drive list
lately I don't know what's been going on
but they're killing me and this is
amazing it just brings so much hydration
to your lips and it just feels super
buttery and smooth and just like when
your lips are chopped and then you put
something like this on your just
in heaven so I've been loving this and
then another was promised a makeup
artist gave me and it's this NARS Velvet
lip glide in the shade stripped this is
what I have on my lips right now I'm
gonna can tell I am all about like this
shade like I don't I love a good bold
lip but like for an everyday basis I
don't even like something that looks a
little too dark it's like half or a
little too like like it has to be
something around this so this has just
been my perfect gloss as I said it's in
the shade stripped highly recommended
benefit have make the most killer team
ever the benefit wants a pilot you have
a version talked about I don't really
want to go into it too much it's just an
amazing cream highlighter but I do want
to just mention it because this is what
goes over it's like beautifully this is
the best that dandelion twinkle blush I
believe this is a little bit newer but
it's this gorgeous light pink kind of
highlighting shade it's not just a
straight-up flush so where I can just
wear this alone because it doesn't have
too much pigment pigment doesn't have
too much pigment and kind of just has
like a nice undertone of like a rosy
peach with sparkles so if you put it
over the benefit walked up this team is
like a duo is killer it's amazing so
I've been loving this lately especially
for summer gotta get one good summer
glow goin this completely does it for me
my sister stole my on phaaze eyebrow gel
and I don't know where I mention I don't
know if I mention it on live stream or
YouTube video something but this brand
happened to notice I mention that so
they were like you don't mean you're
like halo do we notice we heard your
sister so you're on Saudi Brazil we have
something that's very comparable and
we'd love to send you it noticing yeah I
don't leave I'm underground Oh hit me up
so I gave my PO Box and it's this brand
called Mary Kay brow gel and it comes in
a little tiny toon but it lasts so long
and it's only ten dollars so I guess
it's very very inexpensive compared to
the auto garage ah and it holds the kits
the same exact thing in my opinion like
it feels the exact date and lastly I
have a powder that I've been loving this
is my Charlotte
very airbrushed flawless finish I've
just been kind of wanting a powder with
such as compacts and just like a
straight-out matte powder instead of
like the baking as well with my Laura
Mercier one so this just makes your skin
it feel really soft when you put it on
and it just looks airbrushed as it says
so this is the shade to medium I just
really love this the packaging of Silent
Hill very simple with very high flying
and aesthetically pleasing and the power
is great like it's an amazing formula so
that is it for my current favorites
