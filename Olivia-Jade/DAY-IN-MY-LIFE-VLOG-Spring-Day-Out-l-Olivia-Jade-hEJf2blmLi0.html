we're good so it's been a few hours I am
just leaving Holden's house right now
hopefully you can see if I have a lot of
filming to do I am doing a year-long
thing with Sephora Sephora collection so
you're going to see a lot of videos I
love some more collection products I
first started working with them on a
video during Christmas time like three
different lip colors and I just like
absolutely loved the brand and the
actual product so I'm very honored and
excited just put up a unique video so
that's done
love Clinique obviously you guys know I
only do a sponsored post if I like the
brand it's so funny when I see people be
like she's just doing it for money or
like any anybody call masada bother you
to pronounce me it's just so funny
because I don't think people realize how
many brand deals come through every day
that youtubers declined because they
don't genuinely know the product I love
the product but or at least personally
for me in like my friends that I know on
YouTube I want to go to outfits videos
soon I haven't done like fashion on my
channel like styling outfits in a while
so much stuff coming up this next week
because I'm on spring break which means
they don't have school during the week

for like work with my app or like
filming videos or taking meetings or
link press in the morning so oh my god
