today's video I have a tutorial on this
kind of like spring summer daytime glam
I am absolutely obsessed with how it
turned out I think it's one my favorite
makeup looks I know I like to do a lot
of muted kind of like Browns and pinks
themselves but it's just kind of
highlight to do my makeup I try to
change it a little bit I guess so I used
a lot of products I hope you guys love
it I want to say a huge huge make you -
Clinique up for partnering with me on
this video and you one that's a dream
come true and - I absolutely love the
brand I love the product and so glad I
got to collaborate with them or
something that I genuinely love and I'm
going to be using every single day thank
you guys so much for trusting me to
partner up with me and thank you guys
for being so supportive I hope you enjoy
it subscribe if you want already make
sure to give it a thumbs up if you like
this look and yeah make sure to leave
other requests of what you want to see
so with that being said let's get
started okay so first things first I'm
going to just prep my face in general
for the makeup I'm going to first go in
it with my toothpaste hangover primer
you guys know my obsession with this I
love distance cover so this is really
hydrating so it's going to be great for
the foundation so I'm also going to go
in with this chewy essential lip
enhancer conditioning lip treatment just
to press my lips a little bit Cerises
now I'm going to go in with the Clinique
beyond perfecting foundation and
concealer I don't know if you guys
remember this ice uses a really really
really long time ago I'm obsessed with
this foundation I'm just going to apply
this on my face it has a doe foot
applicator which makes it super super
easy to work with and I'm just going to
start by doing one half on my face that
you guys can see the difference in my
skin and it also doesn't dry quickly so
you don't have to worry about working
super soft with it you can just you can
take your time you're not like stressed
you know so I'm just going to take my
Real Techniques expert face brush and
blend this in also if it doesn't look
like my color right now if it looks too
dark or if it's not the right tone this
foundation actually once it is a fully
dry it kind of matches your skin tone so
it's really awesome so obviously you can
see a pretty big difference in skin what
I love about this is it just feels
really lightweight but it gives a really
full coverage and I've only used one
layer of it so yeah honestly if you are
like maybe have acne or you just need a
foundation that feels like nothing but
there clearly is something I think this
would be a great option so I'm going to
go ahead and do the other side literally
just using a brush like this makes it so
easy
also this lasts up to 12 hours so you
can party with it all night long this is
such a good foundation for those of you
wondering because I know I won't get
questions it does retail for I just like
what really gives you it does retail for
$28 this is amazing a fancy bra
goddesses I'm just bringing it above my
lid since it is a concealer as well as
the foundations it's just to cover my
name amazing so after I am done with
that foundation
I don't need concealer but since I want
to kind of do like a summery daytime
glam look I want to highlight so I'm
just going to use this maybelline
superstay better skin concealer and this
is in the shade 20 light the concealer
doesn't provide a bunch of coverage
which is nice because I don't want that
and I'm just going to hit all the high
points on my face I am going to be
blending this out with my sedona late
two one seven brush or 217 and I have
been loving this brush lately for
concealer
take my finger cuz skin-to-skin contact
this lens it really really closely
before I cover anything I'm going to go
in with a little bit of my hula quickie
Quadra stick from a benefit and I'm just
going to warm up you nicely put it where
I want to contour I just want to make
this very very bronze goddess look I'm
going to take a little bit of my Mario
Badescu on just a sculpting brush by
Real Techniques spritz first brick and
cement
everything is blending so beautifully on
top of this foundation I'm going to take
my benefit Watts up highlighter which is
my new one offensive just effect I am
just going to apply this with my ring
finger so it melts the highlight in
tonight
of course I need to apply a little bit
to with the tip of my nose just to get a
cute little button nose highlight it's a
little lumpy so I'm just going to be
taking a little bit of my Clinique
powder this is in the light shade 0-1
it's safe up it's just like a really
light translucent almost comes with the
kind of color I'm just going to take
this on a contour brush but it's tapered
so it's easy to set with and I'm kind of
focused in I'm going to focus this right
on oh my god clean eat really guess it
do you see how matte but is I bought
visit support ages ago and I just put my
something on so since I want to keep
this super glowy I'm going to take my
Too Faced based luminous glow bronzer
and sweet tea I'm going to take this on
just a big taper brush and just kind of
go over the tops of my cheeks
Oh covert ops and cheek sorry so nice
this look is so summer vibe there now
explain it summer we're going again just
on the outside of my forehead kind of
all around I'm going to go in it with a
little bit of Mac's
soft and gentle to just highlight it has
been a longtime favorite what I'm going
to do is just really quick is spray my
face with my Mario Badescu just going to
let that dry for a second while I'm
letting that dry I'm going to move on to
my brows I'm just going to start by
brushing them up I am just going to take
this brow definer by benefit my famous
coffee it has that ankles and then you
just to let give it go I'm just going to
go ahead so we then assess them with a
little bit one selfie a brow gel and
I'll be right back
alright so now for the highlight I am
just going to take my Mac soft and
gentle as I was saying my own paper
brush I want this to be really glowy but
also light still on capping
the excess and I am just going to kind
of pop that on awesome so I'm going to
move on to the eyes I'm just going to
send it again with my hoodie powder and
that same tapered brush just setting the
eyes before shadow so I'm going to be
taking of my morphe 25b palette I don't
know if this is still a same but it's
soaked so it's just really nice colored
for today but pick up just a fluffy
brush by Sigma all over blend and I'm
just going to start with this kind of
chocolatey brown shade in the crease
actually I'm going to mix with chocolate
with this light one up in the corner
I am going to take these two shades
right there one we mix in the crease and
I'm going to apply this one and this one
is straight on the lid so I'm just going
to take that on the shader brush and
applying them all over my lid making
sure that I covered the whole entire
thing and then after I've completely
covered my leg kind of brought it up can
increase a little bit I'm going to go
back in with that transition shade and
just continue blending out into my
crease just deepening it up I'm going to
go in with a little tapered blending
brush and I'm going to take maybe a more
chocolatey Brown right there and I'm
just going to deepen up the outer
corners just like this I am then going
to take this nice pink shimmer shade and
I'm just going to it get a flat shader
brush right a little bit of my Mario
Badescu and just pack that all over my
lid I'm just going to pick up and to
press it
what last time I'm going to take that
chocolatey Brown this crease shade and
the beginning crease shade and just kind
of keep it up the whole entire crease
with us bring it all the way to the
inner corner to the outer corner I am
now going to work on the lower lash line
I am going to start with just a pencil
brush and that first shade be used up in
the corner and I'm just going to really
smoke out my bottom line and then just
going to take a little angled brush and
pick up some of that really dark
chocolatey Brown you were using and
apply that closer to my lower lash line
I am going to give up that little
shimmer and just apply that right to the
middle of the lower lash line I want to
make this center of my lid just a tiny
bit brighter I'm going to go in with
that same brush on that lighter pink
right next to the pink we use and
hopefully to trap a little too much and
just apply that straight to the center
this part is 100% optional if you want
to sit for false lashes I'm going to
just be using the demi whispies in black
I am just going to pop these on and come
right
back so I'm just going to let them at
the clear glue dry for a quick second
I'm just going to take a little bit of
my clinic mascara in the shade your one
black pant whatever I'm going to take a
little bit of my Urban Decay chilling a
setting spray is cooling and hydrating
it says it's oil free so it shouldn't
make our mascara transfer but just in
case I am going to play it safe and just
hold of a palette lastly to finish off
this whole entire look I am going to be
taking a little bit of my Rimmel
lipstick this is in the shade 700
cleanse better this is a very brand new
so I think it's going to look lovely
that is so creamy I'm going to go over
top with a little bit of the Too Faced
lip injection to see color pumping lip
gloss this doesn't have to color this
little Sheen I'm going to be it for this
look thank you so much for watching I
hope you guys left it and I will see you
