before I get into the video number one
I'm blonde or the location of my YouTube
room isn't ideal because there's some
sort of fan or something that makes it
into mine noise so don't know how to
turn it off so hopefully you guys just
don't hear it but if you hear kind of
like an annoying buzz or something
deepest apologies so today I'm going to
teach you guys or show you guys a look
for back-to-school and easy makeup look
and this is super light
you guys can switch it out however you
want if you don't like it or if you love
it just let me know so without further
ado let's get into the video by the way
this is all drugstore so it's super
affordable for anyone and especially
those who are going back to school we
need to save money so this is all
drugstore
I lost starting off with moisturizer
because it lets your makeup settle in
really naturally and it also just
hydrates your skin and it makes makeup
application ten times more natural more
gorgeous easier softer all the stuff you
want I'm going to use this Neutrogena
oil-free moisture sensitive skin
moisturizer this stuff is really really
great especially for it being drugstore
and it just like hydrates your whole
face I want to start with my brows first
just to get that out of the way with
this is the Loreal brow stylist definer
this reminds me so much of the honest
Razia brow is it's basically like the
exact same situation so I'm going to
start by just brushing my brows back in
my eyebrow right here the missing chunk
so I'm just gonna
so after you are done with your breath I
just kind of filled in where they were
sparse so easy obviously if you have
really really sparse brows and you have
like a whole routine just stick to what
you do I have thick brows so I don't
need to do that as much obviously want
to keep them in place all day because
you're at school and it's a long time to
just you know be at school I am just
going to run this straight through my
brows or what I love doing but I decided
to switch it up is I use chapstick to
set my brows okay
speaking of chopstick I'm going to
moisturize my lips before we do anything
else so after you have your brows done
and your lips moisturize and your skin
moisturized let's get into the actual
makeup though I have three concealers
I'm going to be using here this is my
these two are my Rimmel match perfection
and then I also have a Revlon concealer
the photo-ready one so with this
photo-ready concealer I'm going to go in
and cover any like blemishes I have as
you can see I have a whole planet on my
chin so just cover that up under my eyes
just because it's going to be early
you're going to be tired I'm also going
to take this other shade that was in
fair light and this is in fair which is
like a tiny bit lighter for your skin
and I'm just going to put that right
over top the under eyes because I'm just
trying to brighten my face at this point
so after we do that I'm going to be
taking a sponge I'm going to be using my
Real Techniques sponge so you guys can
get to set the drugstore and I love this
sponge so much it through the grade I
favorite drugstore powder is the Rimmel
stay matte I honestly think this is the
same quality as a high-end pressed
powder it is so so good and it lets your
skin like look natural it lets the
makeup sit on it all day and it prevents
creasing it's the best I'm going to use
kind of like an angled contour brush
almost just set just because I want to
get in smaller places and then I'm just
going to press this into my skin
everywhere else and on my forehead I
this really really great thing from the
drugstore and it's the Rimmel London
it's like the Kate Moss collection and
it's a highlight a contour and a blush
so what I'm going to do with that is
start with the contour in the same brush
we used to set our powder just because
it's a contour brush and I'm just going
nuts in the mirror I'm just gonna sculpt
our cheeks this is really nice
right above the temples of our forehead
and under our jaw so after that is done
I'm not you're going to take the blush
which is something I really do but since
it is school I'm gonna cancel out we're
not going to use the highlight unless
you love that intense look I'm just
going to take a little bit of that blush
tap so much noise just give a little
color to our cheeks I'm just going to
take a little concealer and cover the
vein to my eyes even though I'm not flag
shadow I don't like how I have lanes
after we are done with that what I'm
going to do next is just take an
eyeshadow stick by Rimmel and it's
double sided we're going to take this
side of it which as you can see it is
really really nice and dark and I'm just
going to do a really thin amount on my
upper lash line
taking this little BH Cosmetics brush
and I'm just going to smudge at the top
I'm going to show you a really good
affordable mascara
it's the Maybelline the falsies big eyes
and this stuff is literally so good I
would apply it to my upper lashes if I
didn't have remainders of my lash
extensions but since I do I'm just going
to use this on my lower lashes but you
guys should totally get this or try this
out on your upper lashes as well if you
guys are looking for a good drugstore
mascara see I think it just gives a
little extra something to your lashes
I'm going to line and fill in my lips
with this NYX lip crayon in the shade
natural
so that's it for this video thank you so
so much for watching I hope you guys all
loved it and if you were watching this
because you're going back to school have
an amazing year I know I'm a little bit
early on the back to school videos but
