excited about this video
it's my winter beginners makeup tutorial
this is just for a nice easy glow if
you're a beginning guy or gal trying to
learn how to do makeup trying to pass in
2016 I got you covered so just keep
watching if you're a beginner or even if
you just want to learn how to get this
so to start out I am going to use a
primer this is going to let your makeup
last all day on your skin and I
personally think a spray primer is
easier so that's my Smashbox
photo-finish priming water and then of
course going in with a little bit of
chapstick just so you're nice and
moisturized and then I'm going straight
onto brows and the reason I'm going on
to brows instead of straight going into
face makeup is because you want to let
the primer settle into your skin so I'm
using my autoStore Xena brow pencil in
the shade soft brow and the first thing
I'm doing is brushing up my brows and
then that allows you to see where you
have a sparse spots so then you just
take the pencil and do sideward sweeps
little motions to fill in your brows and
then when you get to like the front part
of your brow where that kind of square
part is you'll see but you use it right
here you see a little upward strokes so
it looks a little bit more natural and I
recommend if you're a beginner to get a
brow pencil it makes everything 10 times
easier it makes I don't know it's just a
lot easier than using like a pomade
especially if you're a beginner because
the pomade is super easy to get carried
away with and I love this product
because if you mess up you can just rub
it away with your finger then I'm going
in with my honest Razia clear brow gel I
am going to set my brows with this
setting your brows just makes them not
move especially if you put in all the
hard work filling them in you obviously
don't want you know to like leave your
house and then they're all crazy so this
is like glue I love love love and then
if you're going to be using eyeshadow
which I show you something super easy to
use you want to go in with concealer and
this is going to prime them and it's
also going to conceal the veins on your
lids so when you go in with that shadow
it's super smooth and
and you can't see your veins peeking
through the whatever is in your crease
or your lid or whatever so I just blend
this out with my ring finger it's a very
easy way to blend it you can do it with
a brush you can do it with the beauty
blender but I just think I mean hey it's
free it's easy why not after that you're
going to want to set it with a light
color you can set it with a face powder
but I'm just using it with this kind of
tan shade and putting this on a little
tapered brush and the reason you're
going to want to set your eyelids after
putting concealer on it is because you
don't want it to be sticky for the
shadow you want it to just blend super
super easily and then going in with this
blending e to five brush by Sigma you
need this in your collection I'm going
in with those two shades from the morphe
35o palette and this brush makes
blending every step of the way easier I
don't know if that made any sense but
you absolutely need this if you're a
beginner uhm the shape of it just makes
it so so so easy to blend into your eye
that you're gonna die basically it's
amazing so just blend that in and then I
kind of did the other eye see how easy
that is and then I just take a light
whitey pink shimmery shade and this just
opens your eyes makes them pop and then
going in with those same crease shades
on the same brush this just has like a
little leftover shimmer whatever super
clean I know but I really like this
because it evens out your skin and not
your skin it evens out your eyes you
know what I'm saying when I talk to this
long I start to like I can't speak I'm
then going in with mascara this is the
Too Faced better than sex mascara and
you guys if you're a beginner don't
worry about false lashes and don't worry
about eyeliner we can get to those steps
with a little bit more practice but
mascara is the easiest way to open up
your eyes and just make your face look
so much more awake and it's so so easy
so you just want to start at the root of
your lash and kind of push outward and
then I also do the tiniest amount on my
lower lash line and I like just holding
this and blinking and it makes it super
super full so onto your face you're
going to be wanting to take some sort of
base if you want more full coverage you
can go with a foundation
I like this kind of light coverage look
so I'm going in with my it cosmetics
your skin but better CC plus cream in
the shade media and taking a wet or damp
Beauty Blender and just patting this
into my skin you just want to rinse this
blender under the sink until it gets
nice and big and then you just squeeze
it out so it's like a huge sponge and
then you just press this into your skin
it makes your skin so even and the
reason I think a Beauty Blender or a
sponge this is from Real Techniques
actually is better than a brush is
because there's no streaks it just gives
you a really flawless even amount of
coverage which it's obviously important
whether you're a beginner or so
experienced but for beginners I just
think this is easiest and then I'm going
in with concealer this is my Too Faced
Born This Way concealer in the shade
light/medium we're going to be
highlighting our face in five places so
under your eyes your nose your chin and
your forehead and the reason for this is
so your face doesn't just look all one
color and super flat it gives dimension
to your face without really even trying
and it also just gives extra coverage
conceals your bags and does everything
basically you've ever wanted your face
to look like so I'm just taking that
same Beauty Blender and blending this
into my skin by patting it in and after
I'm done with that and going straight in
with my Laura Mercier translucent powder
and taking that on my Beauty Blender and
pressing this in I'm not baking you
don't know what baking is don't worry
about it just press this into your skin
don't let it sit just make sure it's
nice and blended and this will make your
makeup last all day long and it won't
crease so we're only placing this on the
part we highlighted and then with a big
powder brush I'm going to set the rest
of my face just so it's nice and even
and it looks real good you're looking
real fresh you know just on your makeup
last this just makes your makeup last
all day long so after that what I'm
going to do is take Jacqueline Hales
face palette and I'm going in with that
kind of bronzy blush and our two
highlights on a blush brush and just
putting this on my cheeks you guys don't
need any contouring or bronzing or
intense highlighting but if you guys one
of beginners makeup look on that I can
for sure do like highlighting and
contouring beginners Edition if you want
but
just doing something super easy and then
taking a little bit of that highlighter
highlighting my Cupid's bow the tip of
my nose because I'm obsessed with cute
nose highlights right now I don't know
why it's an issue I'm then highlighting
my cheekbones with my finger this is
just so so so easy and it just makes you
glow it just makes you look more alive
more awake so anyway after you're done
highlighting your face just finish it
off by spritzing it a little bit with
whatever water whatever you have this
just presses the powder into your skin
that excess powder and that's it
so thank you so so much for watching I
love you guys all if you recreate it
tweet me pictures good luck and I will
see you guys next time
