I'm filming this everyday updated
tutorial kind of like natural I don't
know what I'm going to call this yet so
whatever the title says that's what this
video is um my sister's home that's why
I'm hurrying up with my intro because I
don't wanted to come and see em in her
room filming and using her beautiful
window for the light but hi I missed you
guys so much I haven't been on YouTube
in quite some time have been busy with
school just everything like that but I
am back now yeah let's go ahead and get
started into the video and I really hope
you guys enjoy once again I'm sorry for
not being here I've missed my little
baby children yeah I'm like your mom
okay I love you guys let's get started
I'm so sorry what's up what's good but
first I'm starting with my Maybelline
dream fresh BB cream and I probably use
this in my everyday when this is like my
Holy Grail Eva cream I'm just gonna rub
this on my face what I love about this
is it doesn't break me out so that's
great um so make sure you blend down
that neck and I just really wrote it in
it's so light - it doesn't look like
you're wearing any makeup so I use this
just to kind of even out my skin tone it
doesn't have full coverage stuff you
want full coverage I would go with like
a CC cream okay so after you apply the
BB cream all over your face make sure
you blend it down your neck
make sure your neck and your skin I
meant your neck and your face match or
it's like kind of similar and then after
you're done with that I'm going to go in
with some concealer so I'm using my
Maybelline fit me concealer and if you
have the NARS radiant creamy concealer I
was going to use this but then I was
like I'm just gonna go like on the
cheaper side of things these remind me
so much of each other the NARS wants
just like a little bit thicker and then
the maybelline one is like a little
thinner so I love them both the NARS
will probably last a little longer
there's definitely some benefits of a
Knorr one because it is a higher end
product if I literally use or I
literally shut up Olivia I just use a
little white amount of concealer nothing
too crazy and then I use my Sedona lace
spots on it to one-seven
and I just blend it out um since I
already use my I'm talking too much
I'll talk after
okay so after you are done blending your
concealer out as you can see I use such
a light amount and just kind of folks to
under my eyes to get rid of my bags and
then just wherever I kinda have like a
little leftover just dragged it around
my nose or my mouth area and then up my
forehead just for a little more coverage
really not a necessary step if you feel
like you need more coverage you want to
kind of give the same look but you feel
like you need a lot more coverage than
I'm actually doing did that make sense
oh what you can do is just take another
concealer and just place it on and then
just dab it in and just keep building it
up um if you want more coverage of
course you're fine with this like I am
then let's move on so I'm gonna take
this big old what is this blush brush
yeah a Real Techniques it feels so soft
um and what I've been doing Jaggi this
is my last video probably I'm using my
makeup forever perot sculpting duo and
I'm mixing both of this both of this
both of these together I'm like both the
shades cuz it's a highlight and a
bronzer and I'm just mixing mixing
mixing tapping and then just kind of
like putting it on my cheeks like a
blush I'm not contouring with this or
anything but it definitely gives a like
bronzy contour effect which is so nice
and I love the glow it looks so natural
when you blend it with that um bronzer
cuz it's like a natural bronze glow it's
amazing and then I'm shaking that
bronzer part and kind of bringing it up
on my forehead and then just kind of
around much like row and that uh after
that we're going to be moving on to our
eyes I am the most boring person with my
eyes Patrick I changed my mind let's do
brows so I literally haven't been doing
anything with my brows recently I've
just been letting them be natural like
be free be themselves you know
putting product in them they've loved
the look as you can see I have pretty
dark brows but all I'm doing is this BAM
okay this has no product if this is just
like a little brush and I just brush a
bunch of that and then I leave my brows
like that because I kind of like lately
like this sparse like not some shaped
structured brow it's kind of like the
natural kind of like bushy brow look so
BAM
then for eyes my favorite thing in the
world is winged eyeliner I've been
loving my favorite eyeliner to use is
the Kat Von D tattoo eyeliner I know
this and the bronzer weren't drugstore
but the Maybelline um is it may be legit
L'Oreal I don't they have like liquid
eyeliners that work just as well but
this is in my favorite so I'm just going
to stick to it because I've got like
fairly decent at winged eyeliner with
this it's not sure I'm not that good but
I've just been practicing a lot with it
so what I do is I just first take this
see how thin it is it's so thin and I
just make a thin line across my eye look
at my face I'm like yeah so I just do
that this is none this has just a really
thin line and then I just extent I can't
explain it I'm not a makeup artist and I
don't really know what I'm doing but I
just like take this and I pull a little
below lined up
oh I love it when my eyeliner doesn't
work same I messed up my eyeliner
because my eyeliner pen decided not to
have any eyeliner left and then I got
makeup remover in my eyes and out like
really stings and it's red
basically what you're gonna want to do
is just take a really thin line of
liquid eyeliner at least what I like to
do for my wing and I just do a thin line
and then I just extend it to the side
I'm gonna try to show you if it even
like you can even see it but let's see
this works I'm using the Physicians
Formula
most eyeliners really good
and I basically just do a little flick
like that Wow this eyeliner is amazing
and it's so much cheaper than the Kat
Von D one I'm definitely going to start
using this one I like cross my arms like
this to do my other eye so I like arrest
this elbow on this arm because I can't
just go that I'd have to rest it then
I'm using my Too Faced better than sex
mascara which shedding on me huh when
you think you're gonna be using
drugstore and you just fail at life I'm
really sorry but um there's so many
mascaras that are amazing that or
drugstore my Maybelline like double
sided one L'Oreal million lashes or
whatever there's so many huh boom doozy
that
oh boy Oh so now that that mascara is on
I got it all over my fingers but I got
it all
um now that I've cleaned up my plank
back in the game of things the game is
something like ready to keep going on
with my makeup because I messed up so
many times um that's pretty much all I
do for my makeup honestly I really just
like to kind of go with the winged
eyeliner and lots of mascara and then
pretty basic on my face
I usually just finish it off with like a
chopstick or lip gloss so um
for the sake in this video I'm going to
use a lip gloss and that's more like a
makeup tutorial but honestly on an
everyday kind of look I'd probably just
throw on my Kiwi lip smackers actually
don't really like slave a Kiwi oh it
smells so good though so yeah I'd
probably choose a lip smackers but I
will be using my buxom what is this
full-on lip cream in White Russian and
this pull ups your lips this plumps your
lips which i think is kind of weird so
yeah that is it for my everyday makeup
tutorial I hope you guys all enjoyed it
I have missed you more than you even
know um so I'm so happy that I'm filming
again my sister's home and I'm using her
room so I gotta go um but thank you now
I'm scared because she's with three
friends but thank you so much for
watching I hope you guys enjoy it
I'm really stressed out to clean up ah I
hear and don't see you guys in my next
one
