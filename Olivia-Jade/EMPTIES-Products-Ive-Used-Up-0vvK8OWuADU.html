channel I am filming an empties kind of
slash products I've used up video slash
pots I've almost used up used up all of
these products pretty much I have just
fallen in love with and will definitely
be repurchasing or have already
repurchased I've been just holding off
and doing this video so I could collect
more and more stuff so I hope you guys
all enjoy this video and let me know if
you guys have any products does that
actually try because I'm all about
trying new amazing good things so if you
guys do want to see this video then just
keep watching and I hope you guys all
enjoy I'm starting with skincare two
products that I've used up as you can
see they're like demolished because I
just like squeezed all of it out
it's the Lancer polish for sensitive
skin and the Lancer cleanse for
sensitive skin I literally yes these are
so good these two products instantly
cleared up my skin I used the Polish
first and then I would follow up with
the cleanser and then I would follow up
with the Lancer moisturizer which I
still have a lot of so that's my sign
this video my skin reacts really really
well to new products when I first try
them they're so expensive like like
outrageous but it's like a hundred
percent worth it so you know that's that
I finished off my Garnier micellar
cleansing water see nothing left my
forehead the Garnier micellar cleansing
water is amazing it takes off your
makeup like no other also removes dirt
or just extra grime on your face after
at the end of the day but I'm yeah love
this is really good next I finished off
my es shave cream in the vanilla bliss
one it smells so good see it's gone whoa
did you see that
let's care okay there's like the
smallest amount left I got it home I
hope I couldn't like slowly enter
slow-mo now I already have a new one of
these of course this is just my holy
grail shave cream I'm the product this
product literally makes your legs so
freakin soft after you shave your legs
and it smells really good and you can
shave your legs wet or dry so if you
forget to shave your leg I finished off
the it's a 10 miracle leave-in product
see all gone I swear this one won't you
into it are you kidding me I have not
used this product in a really long time
just cuz my hair got used to it and then
I didn't see a difference in it anymore
but when you do use this product I think
it's fair to say that if you use it
every so often not every night but maybe
two times a week or something you do
notice a really big difference in your
hair it's just ten things that it says
on the back so you guys can look that up
you can look up reviews for this if you
are iffy about getting it and they also
have it in a bigger bottle which I also
have because I ran out of this a little
bit ago but I just haven't used like the
product this one or the bigger one and a
little bit of time just because I've
kind of been lazy with my hair I haven't
been taking the best care of it
so like oops whatever staying on the
hair trend I finished off the big sexy
hair spray and play damn this just gives
your hair extra texture it enables your
hair to hold a curl when you've curled
your hair and to give it volume it's oh
by next okay this isn't really a product
necessarily but they're flash tattoos
and I thought I would incorporate this
because it's summertime and a lot of
people are gonna be blinged out in the
flash tattoos basically you don't know
what a flash that is they're like
metallic tattoos that are just like kid
tattoos that you just stick on and then
rub over with water and then peel off
and they are a temporary of course and
cumin necklaces bracelets rings hand
things anklets like all these different
things just little designs you can put
everywhere like and it's honestly so
cool you can make like a flash Pat body
chain and they're beautiful in the
summertime they literally just make you
glow now moving on to make up one more
skincare thing kilos creamy eye
treatment with avocado this is just an
everyday a scent or every night
essential for my nighttime routine and I
am sadly out of it now it's I mean
there's a little bit left in the bottom
it looks like there's so much in on
camera but there's literally not this
was the greatest thing I had your eye
dry under eyes for the longest time and
then the second I started using this
however not drop something in a video
can somebody tell me what video I
haven't dropped Fleming in because I bet
you won't be able to find one because I
drop everything in every single video it
comes in a little little container like
this so it's great for travel and they
also have a bigger size which I think
I'm gonna pick up the bigger size
because I dropped it I can't even get it
who via grasp grasp the stuff practice
holding something see that wasn't so
hard next from makeup I'm gonna start
with this little baby Porefessional
primer it's to minimize the appearance
of pores and its benefit based primers I
don't really ever notice that big of a
difference but this was good NYX jumbo
eye pencil in milk it's just the white
one and I am literally just out it kind
of goes both ways with this I hear some
people like it some people don't like it
I hated this before and now I really
like it I do not think it's good for in
eyeshadow base I just I don't it kind of
crumbles on your eyes it doesn't last
too long but I like popping this in the
waterline it gives your eyes very bright
effect and it kind of
so you look a little bit more awaked I
also like drawing on my face with this
because when we went laser talking
that's when we really used all this up
because when you go to laser tagging
like white glows so we like started
drawing and riding all over ourselves
it didn't glow but we thought it would
look cool and it didn't work but that's
when I use most of this up but as a
product itself it is really really
amazing and I heard the phone ding and I
don't know where it is so I don't for
concealer you were gonna be like Olivia
that is not empty it's halfway but I
really wanted to film this video already
because I've just been waiting a long
time to share my empty products with you
and I mean come on that is half way down
more than halfway there's like that much
left of it so I was like if you guys are
looking for a full coverage moisturizing
drugstore concealer this has a pretty
room not a huge range of colors but I'm
sure you can find one that works for you
I'm very yellow undertone so
neutralizers very very yellow undertone
effects for more face it's the dream
fresh BB cream I am out of this finally
that took way too long to run out of I
use the remainders on my face today and
it is not too full coverage is very
light it doesn't feel like you have
anything on your face especially for the
summertime it just evens out your
complexion it also has sunscreen in it
so and also the Maybelline some of their
BB creams are supposed to be good for
your skin this is a little baby primer
from Stila it's the stay all day liquid
eyeliner no it's a liquid eye primer and
it comes in like this little droplet
like this the reason we're out of this
is because I spilled it all but I would
have used it so fast anyway because I
was using this everyday when I was using
eyeshadow I've noticed such a big
difference with how long my eyeshadow
lasts and this is so fun to put on
because it comes in a little squeezy
tube so you can like squirt it back in
this is a little bit like a little bit
left but it'll be gone shortly x is the
honest Razia Beverly Hills brow Wiz I am
out of this like completely I still use
the spoolie side but like this it's a
goner and I was in love with this for
the time
had it I now moved on what I have in my
eyebrows is just a pencil and then a
little bit of eyebrow gel it has nothing
left on it and I was in the color taupe
which is the lightest one and now I'm in
medium brown which is just so much
better because I can get my eyebrows
more bold and darker which I just prefer
I really like dark thick eyebrows itself
you know how it is and lastly this is
the Rimmel match perfection concealer in
fair light two-30 this looks like it's
those product and it buddy Daksha is mph
just like the layering on the packaging
because I can't get really any more out
of this it was a really really good
product I'm kind of over it now but I'm
sure I will love it again at some point
because I still have three other full
tubes in my drawer when I was obsessed
with it I just stocked up on it but kind
of over it now but it's still an amazing
concealer and it's just because I've
been using different one I'm back on my
NARS radiant creamy concealer so that's
why I'm kind of over this one now but
and my sister kind of has really dark
under eyes because she's just has fair
skin so kind of appears more on her face
and this is her favorite concealer ever
so if you're like that hit me well
you're gonna cut too then you're like
this I hope you guys all enjoyed this
