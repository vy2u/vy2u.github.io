I'm filming a tutorial on my going-out
look so this is kind of my standard look
that I always do so if you want to see
what I do then just keep watching the
first thing I like to do is instead of a
moisturizer sometimes use a moisturizer
I just kind of interchange them but this
is my Mac strobe cream I apply this all
over my face and this just gives me a do
we look and allows my foundation to
settle into my skin beautifully so yeah
after I do that I actually go in with a
primer just so I make sure my foundation
doesn't flip off I'm using my Laura
Mercier foundation primer in hydrating
and I just kind of focus this in my
t-zone area because that's where I'm the
most oily and I want my foundation to
stay I want to make sure it doesn't move
crease anything so primer is really
necessary but the step before did not
really make that big of a difference so
if you don't have strobe cream or
something glowy don't worry about it
next I just use some chapstick I just
use this to moisturize my lips so lip
liner and lipstick go on smoothly and
after I'm done with that I like to start
with my face I use my Chanel aqua
foundation on a wet Beauty Blender and
then on top of the wet Beauty Blender I
just spray my Tasha luminous skin mist
and then this just makes the foundation
look so glowy and natural I love it and
then I just take my Beauty Blender it
put the foundation on my face and then
blend from the center out
so after you are done blending out your
foundation I'm going in with my I forget
what this is called but it's by
Maybelline it's my concealer I'll link
all the products I use down below but
yeah what I do is I just put two
triangles under my eyes so this conceals
and highlights and then I just take my
Beauty Blender and blend it out once
again
you
so I also bring the concealer down my
nose on my forehead and all my chin to
highlight I like making the center of my
face super bright and then I kind of go
in with a bronzer which you'll see
either in the next step or in a couple
steps and that's when I kind of bronze
the rest of my skin but for concealer I
love highlighting in the center of my
face
after I do that I take my Sedona lace to
1-7 brush and my Ben I translucent
or colorless face powder as they like to
call it and I just kind of take that
brush and set everywhere I concealed at
first so I focus this so that my under
eyes don't crease because that's the
worst so I put that under my under eyes
and then on my chin down the bridge of
my nose and all my forehead and then
after I've set the places we highlighted
I take a huge fluffy brush from Sigma
and set the rest of my skin after I do
that I add some color back into my face
so I'm going in with this tart cream
bronzer it's a little red for my liking
I feel like it's too reddish brown but
I'm still playing around with it so I
love tart though one of my favorite like
companies ever with makeup so I apply
this under my cheek area to define my
cheekbones and then just on the temples
of my forehead so it gives me a bronzy
look so that my center of my face is
highlighted and then around can be nice
and bronzed and colorful I just take a
damp Beauty blender and blend that out
and I just use patting motions and
that's basically what I do you can see
what I'm doing here
after you blend that all out just give
it an extra tap make sure it looks nice
and natural and then go on to your brows
or at least that's what I like to do so
for this tutorial I just kind of wanted
to play around make my brows thicker
than normally um than normal I meant but
I use my Anastasia brow Wiz and I just
kind of start by defining the front of
my brow so I kind of make it look like a
square if you will just the front part
and then I kind of I don't know what to
call it like lift my arch a little bit
by filling in a little bit higher so
this looks super intense right now as
you do it but once you take the other
side of the pencil and then brush
through the brows it looks so much more
natural right here so obviously this is
thicker than I've ever done so I was
just kind of messing around with it I'm
not sure if I like it I probably won't
do this you know every time but I do
like just a little fill in when I'm
going out and this was a little more
intense than anticipated and then just
setting that with the honest Asya brow
gel this stuff is like glue I didn't
show you the other side just for time I
didn't want to make you sit through it
but did the other thing the other thing
I'm in I did the same thing on the other
side then I use my Too Faced primer in
the champagne ish shade and I apply this
on the lids of my eye this is the most
beautiful primer at last all day because
it's a primer and it totally looks like
a sparkly eyeshadow and it's so
effortless and easy so I take my ELF
little black book palette and then I
just mix those kind of bronzy shades
together as you saw and I just take a
big crease brush and blend that into the
crease what I love about this palette is
it's super affordable elf has everything
from like one to ten dollars so super
cheap and the colors are amazing
after I do that I'm just taking the
shades I blend it into my crease and
taking a flat shader brush and bringing
that on my lower lash line just to smoke
it out a little bit and then after
you're done with that I like to do
eyeliner so a really thin amount goes a
really long way I use my Kat Von D
tattoo eyeliner and as you can see I'm
just drawing the thinnest amount this
isn't to do anything fancy or make or
change the I look or make it look
different or cool or anything this is
just to make my actual lashes look a
little bit thicker that's a trick if you
do a really thin amount it'll make the
actual top lashes look thicker and
longer and blacker
so after you do that you can take a
pencil liner if totally your choice but
I like to just smoke it out even more I
never wear makeup during the week so
when I get to do my makeup on the
weekends I love it I just have fun with
it I play around I smoke things out so
that's basically what I'm doing I'm just
taking a sigma pencil eyeliner and
putting that in my waterline and smoking
it out and then I'm taking my mascara
I'll have everything linked down below
and I'm just coating my lashes making
them look nice and black and yeah that's
pretty much what I'm doing here
I'm taking my Kat Von D contour kit I'm
taking that middle bronze and I'm doing
a harsh contour you're gonna blend this
out do not worry I probably wouldn't to
bring it down much further than I did
this was really cognate I can't speak
cutting it close I would kind of follow
the right side rather than the left side
since I brought it down a little far on
the left side but I'm taking this huge
fluffy brush that we use for powder and
blending it out and I actually stick the
brush in the banana shade and the Kat
Von D as you can see I'll show you right
here see how it has that banana color
this helps it blend out and look more
natural and more subtle and less kind of
bronzy color to it because obviously our
skins not naturally contoured like that
so this really helps then highlighting
highlighting I highlight so much I'm
using my Sedona lace two one seven brush
and highlighting the tops of my
cheekbones because that's my favorite
spot to highlight ever loved it so glowy
everyday routine I highlight
highlighting is my jam I'm just blending
on my forehead I love highlighting Wow
I'm taking my Becca highlight and opal
by the way and I'm just kind of blending
that with my finger cuz it got intense
around my eyebrows and then I just blend
that out with a Beauty Blender so it
looks extra natural and then to finish
off my look I do some lips so this is my
favorite lip liner it is what is this
NYX is shade and natural it's the most
beautiful nudish pink and I just kind of
fill that in a little bit and then go in
with my Too Faced melted lipstick and
I'm not quite sure what the shade is I
want to say it's sugar but I'll for sure
link it down below and that's basically
what I do for my look
so that's it that's my luck I hope you
guys enjoyed thank you so much for
watching and I'll see you guys in my
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
