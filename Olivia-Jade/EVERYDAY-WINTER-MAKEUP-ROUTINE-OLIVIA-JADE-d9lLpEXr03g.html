you my everyday winter makeup routine
this is what it looks like right here if
you aren't subscribed it would mean the
world and let's get started so the first
thing I do is I use my Mario Badescu
rose water spray this is my Holy Grail
and then I go straight into brows I'm
using my Otto Stassi eyebrows in the
shade soft Brown I basically do the same
thing with my eyebrows every single
makeup tutorial that you see on my
channel I just use this little pencil to
fill them in and this pencil is so so
manageable and so easy to use so if
you're looking for like a good good brow
pencil I seriously recommend this
whether you're a beginner or super super
experienced it's so incredibly easy to
use and I'm pretty much obsessed with it
I don't know what I do without it so of
course the usual I'm using my Anasazi
that clear brow gel to set my brows you
guys can also use like gos chapstick or
any sort of chopstick or something tacky
like that to set your brows if you don't
have a brow gel and then I'm going in
with my Laura Mercier foundation primer
in the radiance I don't know of section
and I'm just patting this in to my skin
making sure it gets nice and tacky so I
know that my makeup is going to last all
day I'm then going in with one more
primer I'm using my Smashbox photo
finish primer water and I'm just
spritzing this all over my face and then
after that I'm going in with my holy
Holy Grail you guys know I mentioned
this in my favorites if you watch that
video this is the it cosmetics CC plus
cream I'm in the shade media and I just
use this on a damp Beauty Blender you
can basically see how incredible this
looks but I have nothing bad to say
about this you could literally have such
full coverage or such light to medium
coverage it looks so natural it's so
glowy it doesn't feel like there's tape
or anything heavy on your skin I just
apply this straight to my Beauty Blender
and blend it into my skin I take it up
to my eyelids a little bit blend it down
my neck and most importantly don't
forget your ears
I'm then going in with my Maybelline
better skin concealer I'm using a really
really really light amount of this and
just warming it in a triangle so it kind
of creates a highlighted effect I am in
the shade light in this concealer by the
way and I'm just taking my damp Beauty
Blender and blending this out once again
the usual I'm just patting this into my
skin and I'm not doing any crazy
highlighting because that's not what I
do
on an everyday basis after this I'm
going in with my Clinique chubby stick
in the shade curvy contour and I'm just
kind of shaping my cheekbones and
warming up my forehead a little bit just
the temples to give myself a bronzed
glow you guys know no matter what season
it is I'm always good for the bronze so
I just Pat that in with my damp Beauty
Blender it blends so so nicely I love
this product and it's super easy to use
after this highlight my favorite
favorite part I'm using my benefit
walked up highlighter and I just use
this with my ring finger and apply this
to my cheekbones you'll see all the
places I apply it to but the reason I
use my finger is because the warmth of
our hands it really melts the product so
so well so I'm applying to my Cupid's
bow a little bit to my nose a little bit
to my cheeks anywhere that I just want a
little bit of an extra glow and then I
just did the leftovers on my forehead
and then going in with a NYX HD
finishing powder and I'm using this
Sigma concealer blunt kabuki x79 brush
and I am just kind of patting in the
places I didn't highlight I'm really
trying to avoid where we did cream
highlight and kind of where we cream
contoured because I don't want to dull
out the colors but I am making sure to
set a makeup so it lasts a while I'm
taking this big tapered Sigma powder
brush I think it's called it's the
tapered face f25
I am just basically blending this all
over my face so then I'm using that same
Sigma concealer blend kabuki f7 9 brush
and I'm just using that with my HD
finishing powder by NYX and setting my
concealer and then going in with the
kylie burgundy palette that ii shade and
just really messily blending this in my
crease a little bit above my crease I'm
not being precise with this I'm blending
this out with my Holy Grail
e-40 blending brush by Sigma by the way
and after I'm done with that I go in
with my cream highlight again the
benefit wants up and I'm just
highlighting the inner corners of my
eyelids just to give myself a little bit
of a wake look I don't really know and
then I'm also taking out my ring finger
and just blending a little bit on my
eyelids to once again just make me look
a little bit more awake I'm then taking
this Kat Von D tattoo eyeliner I don't
know if you guys can really tell but
like the bristles completely I don't
even know afraid on my little eyeliner
so it's really easy to mess up so I
definitely have to go get a new one now
cuz it's really hard to be precise but
after I get my eyeliner on I just used
my better than sex mascara by Too Faced
I sometimes curl my lashes I sometimes
don't it honestly just depends on the
day and after I am done with that I'm
going to go in with my makeup forever
Pro sculpting duo and that big Sigma
tapered f25 brush and then after that
I'm just using a little bit of chopstick
this is the rosebud solve and that is it
for the look this is my everyday winter
makeup routine completed I hope you guys
enjoyed it thank you for watching and I
will see you guys next time
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
