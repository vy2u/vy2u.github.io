today's video I have this problem makeup
look for you guys I am so excited about
it and I'm really excited because I'm
working with - based on this video I am
showing you their love light
highlighters and also the new unnatural
love palette this retails for almost $60
$59 and my highlighters are $30 each
just want to say that before I first
video since I forgot to mention it was
applying the product and everyone always
that I love how the eye makeup turned
out I used some fun sparkles outside the
palette but everything else on my eyes
is the palette and you guys are going to
dive with these transition shades
I promise and also my glow is by later
so I hope you guys loved this video
please subscribe if you do it means so
much to me if you recreate this or prom
or just for an occasion or something how
many photos I would love to see it what
that means that I don't you guys enjoy
this video and let's get started the
first thing I'm going to do is
definitely moisturize and hydrate my
skin I'm going to start with my Marc
Jacobs invisible undercover perfecting
coconut face primer this is like my
favorite thing in the world it is so
hydrating it just makes your skin feel
really really fresh and amazing I'm
going to do my eye makeup first but this
is just literally just prep your skin a
little bit go in with a little bit of
chopstick a little tiny bit of eye cream
this is my it cosmetics confidence in a
cream eye cream it's like my favorite
thing of the world so the first thing
I'm going to do before I diving into
eyeshadow which you guys going to see my
favorite palette one of my favorite
palettes of the moment no joke I'm just
going to prime my eyes with a little
concealer to cancel out the name since
this is prom you do want to just make
sure you're super super flawless for
photographs and stuff so just going to
blow that out
that was just my heart-shaped tape and
I'm just taking this big squishy B bunch
of my morphe
so once that is all blended out I'm just
going to
the first shade called heaven in the Too
Faced natural love palette and I am just
going to bring that all over my leg just
to set the concealer so I don't know if
you guys remember when I went to the to
sector headquarters and then kind of
experimented with this palette when it
for without lighting in it I'll have all
the links down below but yeah there's 30
shades they're all gorgeous I would say
it's more of like warm tones if I'm
color
I'm not calling right oh I love okay so
the first thing I'm going to do is just
take any sort of crease blending brush
whatever you have and I'm just going to
take the shade honey butter and nudie
which is this one right here and this
one right there and those are just some
really pretty warm toned Browns and I'm
just going to kind of blend that in my
crease this is just our transition I
feel like you're going to notice too
that this look I really want to build up
instead of just drawing on a couple
colors it's prom if you're doing your
makeup by yourself this is really easy
to follow alone two levels so that just
kind of gave some really nice definition
um in the eyelid I feel like it looks so
weird cuz I threw this at my head it's
like so obvious I'm then going to use
the same brush and just go in with that
shade makeup and chill before I work on
the eyes you really want to get the
crease dialed in but no pigmented so
what are we using the lightest hand in
the world to blend this out I'm going to
do the exact same thing to the other eye
and it go back in with that shade honey
butter and mix it with the shade
spotlight right next to it and I'm just
going to blend out the edges just
diffuse it a little bit
I have decided to order this Stila
magnificent metals glitter and glow
liquid eyeshadows I have heard so much
about being so I need to talk about
especially with YouTube I mean like come
on I'm going to apply this all over my
eyelid and I don't know if I need a
brush I'm watching around the course I'm
going to grab a flat shader brush just
in case I end up needing blah I'm going
to use this little this little thing
whatever you have works but let's just
see if I whoa
going to part wow just going to kind of
blend it in the inner corner so it's not
too much and then I'm just going to kind
of like pop it through my whole entire I
really make sure it's nice and pigmented
I don't want it to be too messy I want
it to be kind of like a nice neat look
so I'm just going to continue applying
that to my eyelid I kind of like the top
like a purpley Brown because it's kind
of a mixture of gold gold hump at all I
kind of make sure of like a warm tone
and a cool tone of a look
all right so I'm like kind of really
obsessed with that let's go
yep girl kick out that prom and go back
in it with this shade honey butter and
uni this first two shades we applied in
the cream and I'm just going to keep
them to keep up a little bit more
especially the outer part of it I'm
going to take the shade makeup and chill
right here and I'm going to take this
home like a really precise angle brush
because I really just want to keep it
close to the lower lash line before I go
in with those muted neutral shades and
really smoke it out
perfect and what that is done I'm just
going to take this kind of pencil smudge
brush and make them the shade a honey
butter spot light and not shave nudie up
there and really kind of smoke out the
outer edge
this to PayPal is so pigmented
transitions are perfect one last time
I'm going to take this brush again just
take that dark shade makeup and chill
and then just smoke it out a little bit
Corsa millimeter spinning out so I'm
going to apply a little bit more sugars
so it's really poppin for prom I am also
going to eventually put the sparkles on
my lower lash line maybe in the center
right there but I'm going to do the fake
makeup before I do that part just
because obviously I don't want it to get
messed up a concealer and stuff I am
just going to prep my skin really click
with a little bit of this co party
coconut rose toner so I saw this problem
when I makeup to last all day I'm going
to use the Estee Lauder Double Wear stay
in place makeup I've heard nothing but
good things so I ordered this off of all
that as per usual I will link everything
down below all the truth based off
everything I use so I am just a little
frustrated they don't have a pump so I'm
just going to apply it to my finger in
it so that she looks right so I'm just
going to be taking this on my morphe and
for 3:9 brush and really blending this
out all of my face in circular motions
who is foundations beautiful cold for
some pressure
supposed to be okay I do I get it I
guess I'm going to take this brush I
wanted to make my look and just couldn't
do the forehead I really like that
morphe brush set just a little big on
the forehead I am now going to go in
with a heart shape tape I just saw fit
so you've never seen on my channel which
is kind of crazy and I'm just going to
apply a little bit of it you guys don't
need too much because so much comes out
and I'm just going to hit the high
points on my faces it's prom you want to
go where the light naturally hits yes
also right here does wonders if you
apply a little bit there when you do
bronzer so it's not going to kind of
melt down your face so I really love
doing it right there taking my big dance
morphe sponge this works way better than
a Beauty Blender I thought that until
talking about this and I was like I'll
try it and it's really good so I'm just
going to kind of like pump this into my
skin Bobbi freed the concealer is a
little bit lighter but I didn't want it
to be too light because in photos
especially flash photography you don't
want like white under your eyes so just
keep that in mind when you are applying
your concealer so after you blow up out
you definitely want to set that right
away you don't want that creeping I'm
taking my Laura Mercier translucent
powder and I'm just going to pop that
right into place
I don't do like a super heavy base with
it but since it is prom and you want
this to last a really long time I am
going to just kind of lightly baked
where we highlight it all the time would
look like that you're going to wash it
away you look a little crazy but I
promise it's all good but that same
powder I'm just going to put a little
bit I'll give up cream bronzing but I
just feel like we don't really need it
take this big out and our Jake is fresh
and just take the rest of it and kind of
set the face before I do anything else I
want to fill in my brows I'm taking my
benefit goof proof brow pencil and I'm
just going to take the one side to brush
it out and then I'm going to take this
side to brush my brows I was one of her
really thick brows but I think I overdid
it a little bit okay now I'm going to be
taking up my cheek parade benefit little
palette this palette is amazing I'm
going to be mixing the two who love the
light on my morphe and five to seven
brush and just kind of warming up the
perimeter of my face just giving us some
colors so you don't look washed out I
already have a tiny forehead so I don't
like to put too much on there
but if you do have a bigger forehand I
want to make it look a little bit
smaller just put bronzer out there and
I'm just going to do this for the
purpose of warming it up a little bit so
I look like a bit at the beach always
wind down it after I kind of warm up the
face a little bit and take that same
brush and take that California shade
believe the design aspect new blush -
just a tiny bit on the cheeks and that
we have a real showstopper which are the
two fates love light highlighter so when
I went to tube base headquarters and I
saw these I was literally like how awful
they are literally perfect um this one
is in the shade you light up my life
it's like it's really really pretty gold
it's a little really gorgeous to be a
really dark skin I have this really
amazing shade called ray of light it's
kind of like a more pink gold and this
would look really gorgeous on like
medium to tan skin um and then I
officiate called blinded by the light
and it's just this really nice light
pink I actually got my sister one of
these because she is really beautiful
tired skin and she as you can tell at
the top of it before I apply these to
the skin I am just going to take a
little bit of my rose water spray just
to dampen the skin up a little bit give
it some life again and before I go in
with these showstoppers and I think
since I am NOT picked hand at all I am
going to use the shade blinded by the
light and I'm going to mix it with ray
of light which is mystic gold
so this one is ray of light and I'm
going to mix it with lime defy the light
I'm just going to take this on like a
little fan brush whatever you have I'm
going to start with the pink gold
aka bright light and I'm just going to
apply this do you see how little I use
to the cheat and ribs are so pretty Oh
my god and because I don't want it to be
super super pink on my cheek I'm going
to taste the shade blinded by the light
which is normal white and applying that
oh my brother just really made it so
pretty a little knowledge of my nose you
don't have to do this I love doing this
I think it looks cute in photos I just
want to be really careful where I played
this because it's tense you are going to
take photos at home you don't want to
look oily so I'm not going to put in in
books in my forehead but maybe on a
summer day out I would put in matenda
forehead I just want to make sure I'm
hitting the point where in photos it's
going to look really pretty but not like
oily even though this highlight doesn't
look away at all it just looks really
reflective and pretty and but you don't
play it safe always I'm going to take
that thing shade a smoldering fashion
and I'm just going to take a little bit
of this on the brush we were using
earlier and apply that right in the
middle of the lower lash line just like
that
I am going to take a little bit of my
Too Faced better than sex mascara just
applying it to my lashes also my lower
lashes just a little bit so what's the
mascara dries I'm going to go in with my
Ardell at gentlest be lashes guys have
probably heard me talk about these
before I'm just going to cut the inner
corner
so lastly to finish off the lift
undertaking with this colour-pop lippie
pencil in on yours and the same lippie
pencil but in the shade Boys Town and
I'm going to take the shade I'm Yours
and just line my lip up and boys Talon
and just kind of like just kind of do
like a little bit of an ombre effect
and lastly just apply to the center I'm
taking this color pop ultra satin lip
here's the shade it's stripped so about
fit for this video thank you so much for
watching as always I love you and I'll
see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
