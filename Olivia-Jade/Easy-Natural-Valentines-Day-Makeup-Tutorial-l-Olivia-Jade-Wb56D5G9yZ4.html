youtube channel
I'm Olivia Jade if you're new here don't
forget to subscribe I am so excited for
today's video because I'm doing a
Valentine's Day makeup tutorial and I
beat this holiday but it's fine I'm just
kidding Valentine's Day is so fun you
can do something with your girlfriend's
you can do honestly whatever you want
and I just wanted to do like a really
easy it make of toriel for beginners
because you know who wants to feel
stressed on Valentine's Day about makeup
my alarm is going off where is that what
is it oh let's just jump right into the
video I hope you guys enjoy it also I'm
sorry for this background and the
lighting and everything that's going on
I'm in New York right now with Marc
Jacobs and there will be a blog coming
don't you worry but yeah so I'm just
working with what I have but I know you
guys are always super chill with you
know whatever I do to make things work
I'm not stressed so thank you also we're
in New York City so you're gonna hear
construction let's start with prepping
our skin I'm going to do a little bit of
lip balm I'm also gonna take a little
bit of this hydro care for upset
irritated skin remarkable soothing
lotion this is the lotion my facialist
recommends and she's amazing so I just
been using it for too much
something that's an absolutely saving my
life is this kills avocado I treatment
it's just an eye cream that you guys
this makes all the difference in the
world with my concealer you know when
you can tell you're wearing concealer
because it kind of like dries up this
makes it just look like it's part of
your skin and it's gorgeous
and I've tried plenty I creams but this
is the only one that really does that
for me so I'm gonna link it down below
you guys need to get this so this is
your choice if you want to wear a
foundation or tinted moisturizer or
whatever it is I have been on this thing
lately where I don't want to wear
foundation or tinted moisturizer I don't
know why I've just been like extra lazy
with makeup I'm gonna do concealer I've
been liking that
and I'm baked and right now but I'm just
going to apply this under my eyes this
I'm just taking this basically in the
center of my face or where I have
redness
and then I'm just going to ABBA lend it
all out really been liking this I'm also
just bringing it up on my lid so we can
prime in one step
pretty crazy
so after that's all bilenda now I'm
going to take a little bit of my powder
and I'm setting that down right away you
don't want any creasing I'm just gonna
let that sit there around the places we
highlight it so I'll just take my hoola
bronzer because it's what I packed easy
honestly you don't have to have these
exact products whatever concealer you
like whatever bronzer if you want to
make this a more generic look so you
guys can use what you already have so
let's just bronze the skin
so while we're here so we don't have to
look at my crazy brows anymore I'm going
to fill them in really quick like look
how crazy they are I don't know I need
to get them done my gosh
my eyes are burning from the side that
look horrible are these shadows looking
crazy
hopefully not I'm also i forgot brow Jo
so I'm gonna set this with lip balm all
right I'm gonna wipe off that powder
because it has been under the eyes a
little bit now after that is completed
I'm going to move and focus on the
cheeks a little bit more so this blush
has been absolutely gorgeous and I think
it's like the perfect Valentine's Day
blush it's the milk cream blush in the
shade rally I use my last video for the
first time and I just became obsessed so
I'm just gonna apply this one like my
three fingers and I don't have any
highlight yet okay keep that in mind I'm
not a huge blush girl but I feel like
for Valentine's Day super pretty and you
guys you don't have a highlight on so
that's pretty crazy can I take a little
bit of my benefit Watts up cream
highlight and just apply this right on
the cheekbone there this is like my
favorite highlighter ever as you guys
know and I think it's gorgeous it's so
skin like so we're just glowing today
you know we are just going for it I'm
gonna set my eyes with a little bit of
powder oh did I not blend concealer on
this one I think one of the perfect
palettes to use is the Too Faced Just
Peachy mattes I mean come on it's
Valentine's Day we want to go for like a
very peachy look or I want to at least
so that's what I'm gonna do today I am
going to take a little bit of
shade called Just Peachy and I am
obsessed with this so pretty and cute
and I'm just gonna apply this all over
in my crease
okay I'm then going to take a little bit
of this shade called peach punch I take
this on a more dense fluffy brush and
again it just apply in my crease but a
little bit lower down
well after that I'm going to be going
back in with that shade just peachy on a
flat shader brush and I love the shade
I'm going to be applying this all over
the lid
I'm gonna take a little bit of like a
little flat shader brush and kind of
work on the lower lash a tiny bit I know
Pink's can be extremely intimidating to
put in your lower lash because of
pinkeye and you don't want to look like
you have an eye disease but if you are
just focused and controlled and you just
erase the look it's gonna look awesome
so I just go I like try and connect it
so it looks like it's all there
you know like all kind of like in a wing
then I'm taking Just Peachy and I'm
smoking this one out a little bit lower
and who wants to see my most favorite
unprofessional trick ever I heard
someone say me so I take any clean brush
that I have this is gonna you're gonna
be like immediately unsubscribe untrust
she's a psycho but I do this and I
literally just blend out a little bit to
diffuse it this is like the laziest way
to do things see but it just diffuses it
so much so it's not as intense and it's
like a very subtle kind of paint okay
and then I'm just gonna take a more
dense kind of brush and I am just going
to take this shade called a peach
sangria and it's kind of like a modest
purple and I'm just gonna take the
smallest amount and apply it right out
the outside right there
my good old trick especially just used
okay now I thought about whether I
wanted to do winged eyeliner or what I
was feeling this is by the way just the
simple eye look I'm gonna leave it there
because I think it's beautiful and easy
to recreate and that's obviously the
point of this video I want you guys to
be able to do it I don't want to be
doing crazy wings or smoky eyes or
something that I couldn't do if I didn't
practice like every day in my life so
I'm gonna do what some lashes I'm gonna
show you guys this amazing trick for
lashes that will make your life and the
ladies easier I just used the are gel
demi whispies and I just take one lash
just one this makes everything easy and
then on the or doubt that me whispies
you can kind of see their sirens alone
but you see how there's like little dots
on the edge of each lash like you can
see like 1.2.3 delt whatever it makes it
super easy to cut basically is what I'm
trying to say I just cut the lash um
like this and then I apply a little bit
of glue this just makes a lash
application million times easier you
just stick it at the edge it gives you
kind of that gorgeous like cat eye
winged effect without having to learn
how to put on a wing surprisingly lashes
are a million times easier than wings
and then just make my lash curler and
blend
the real and the fake and now for the
best part a little bit of mascara to
really make the biggest difference
the last thing I'm gonna do is take this
Marc Jacobs high shine lip lacquer this
is in the shade sugar sugar and I want
high shine on this wonderful day I'm
going to show you in some different
lighting - very peachy anyway I just
thought I would show you guys a
different kind of look so you guys this
is the final look I hope you enjoyed it
I hope you have a beautiful Valentine's
Day thank you for watching and I will
see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
