I am filming my everyday makeup routine
which is what I'm wearing on my face
right now so if you guys do want to see
how to get this look or how I get this
look or what I do on an everyday basis
then just keep watching because I showed
you obviously but quick announcement I
have a posting schedule finally it's
about time it was really stressful and
really weird how I just was spitting out
videos and then not posing for a week
and then throwing out a bunch of videos
and then not posting and then it's kind
of unfair and you guys were like oh my
god it wasn't so much and then I'd leave
for like a week so I'm glad now that I
figured out a perfect time perfect dates
for me to post and I will be posting
every time on these days or every every
mmm how will we go take a video on these
days Wednesdays and Saturdays I don't
have a specific time that they go up but
yeah I just look out for videos on
Wednesdays and Saturdays and if I have
an extra video or I'm feeling like oh I
just want to throw out another video
this week that's not going to stop me
now because I have a posting schedule
I'll throw it out on Monday or Tuesday
or Thursday or Friday or Sunday a Dave
sighs Wednesday Saturday but once and
Saturday I will always have video up and
if I don't then feel free to like harass
me on Twitter I don't have a video up
once your Saturday I will announce that
a video will not be coming so you'll
know it won't just be like a random Oh
bye and I might not get a video up every
Wednesday and Saturday I haven't had a
posting schedule since I first started
my channel so this is kind of new to me
and I just kind of have to get used to
it but I think I'll be able to do it and
it will push me to make more videos I
think I needed to make a posting
schedule this probably a good thing so
if you guys do want to see the look and
if you're excited for the posing
schedule thumbs up give a thumbs up why
not and yeah thank you for watching all
you haven't watch it yet but have fun
watch it and I will see you guys on the
other side when I'm doing my makeup but
I'm starting with my Maybelline fit me
concealer I don't use this exact
concealer every time I do my everyday
makeup routine it really just changes
but it's always a liquid concealer so
what I do with this is I put it right
under
I like that I do it on my other side of
course um like that and then since I'm
not using a foundation or a BB cream or
anything like that I take it where I get
redness most girls will always get
redness in the place as I cover it up
especially around the nose because just
like hormones and stuff I guess I'm then
taking it my BH Cosmetics number to
brush in like the white collection and
then just blending it out really lightly
around my nose and everything like that
up my forehead since I'm not using
foundation or anything like that I just
kind of put my concealer where I have
redness and then I just take this and
blend it out so after you're done
blending it out I blend blend blend so
it looks flawless natural just like my
second skin not caked on not you know
just very very natural but makes me look
more awake after I use the concealer I'm
taking my Sigma tapered highlighter f-35
brush and my Rimmel stay matte powder by
the way all these products that I'm
using will be linked down below and I
think it's good I want to drugstore a
roll right now a lot of my products are
drugstore which i think is really good
and then I'm just taking this on that
highlighter brush which is my all-time
favorite setting brush and I'm just
putting this directly under the eyes to
make sure it doesn't crease or move
throughout the day I'm not setting my
forehead around the nose or the chin
just because I like that kind of dewy
look so I don't want that to go away
since my eye look is never really heavy
or crazy on an everyday basis I do my
whole face first then move on to the
eyes so this step is so crucial for me
on an everyday look I always take my
hula bronzer by benefit which has just
been my favorite recently and I'm taking
this Smashbox brush
it's kind of like a blush or powder
brush but a little bit thinner a little
tinier I would say and I just load my
brush up with the bronzer we cap it off
a little bit and make sure you can
definitely see some bronzer on there and
this part you just need to make sure all
your hair is out of your face because
we're starting on the forehead this I
think is the most beautiful bronze look
I love that I mean obviously needs to be
blended but I just love that look I
think it is so summery and I just oh
this part is definitely my favorite step
so I'm just bringing this all over from
the forehead and then we're gonna add
more don't worry blend this out but this
is like my favorite step cuz you're
going to want the idea what this part is
you're just going to kind of bronze
everywhere around your face except the
part we highlighted you're going to keep
the center bright and then around your
super bronzy and glowy so I'm taking
this and just putting it on the back of
my cheekbone oh I love this I love it
love it love it I'm going to also take
more bronzer this is like my favorite
part this is where I just kind of go
crazy and bronzing the jaw up makes me
look so glowy it's just my favorite
thing ever to bronze I love love love
love bronzing which is like my favorite
thing so after you're done bronzing
which I think just looks so gorgeous and
so sunkissed and flawless and ahh this
bronzer it doesn't look cakey or powdery
or on the skin it looks so so natural so
if you guys want to invest in a good
bronzer hoola bronzer is amazing I love
it because it bronzed up the skin and
you can also use it to contour which I
don't do as much anymore I used to
contour literally every day I thought it
was like life it was like my it was my
thing I couldn't go without contouring
but now I'm just so into that kind of
natural bronzy look that I kind of know
contour as much so not for the crucial
part this has been added to my everyday
makeup routine more recently and not
just a fierce highlight
um a strike on Hill would say we got to
get our highlight on fleek this is the
Becca cosmetics Jaclyn hill highlight
and champagne pop oh my gosh I posted
this on Twitter I ordered three of them
because I heard it was limited edition
and it is just so pretty I've been
stalking through Becca cosmetics and
Jaclyn Halen and all their retweets and
stuff and this honestly complements any
skin color from dark skin to the
lightest skin it gives the most
beautiful highlight I didn't even know
that was possible
so like honestly congratulations to her
either Mitchell ever see this but she
does an amazing job of it so so anyway
I'm just taking this on my finger and
putting this on my cheekbones and just
running it right on the top of my
cheekbones guys oh this highlight is out
of this world now for the brows I just
take my Maybelline brow precise by eye
studio shaping pencil in soft brown and
I don't use a lot of this at all
I literally just take this right here
and right there and then I pop off this
side and I brush brow out
my brows are already pretty dark I would
say so I don't like doing a lot because
I don't like when they're like overly
dark you know so what I love doing is
just taking a brow gel a clear brow gel
my favorite is my honest Razia one but
this one is I have no idea where this is
even from it's just a little brow set
I've taught you where I got it but all
of them work the same it's not like a
crucial step so I'm just kind of setting
eyebrows we're almost coming to an end
here I love doing a very thin line of
eyeliner just to make my lashes look a
little thicker darker and longer and
just to make my eyes pop a little bit so
I'm using this L'Oreal the infallible
black buster liquid eyeliner and it says
it lasts for about eight hours I never
have tried or tested that but I love
this because it's like a huge marker so
I find it easy to use some people might
think this is so much more difficult but
I love it obviously and um
BAM so I love doing that just a really
thin line makes such a big difference
for my eye as you can see or I don't
know if you can really tell on camera
but when I look into here this I just
looks a lot more awake and kind of
brighter and darker just for the eyes to
finish it off I don't do shadows or
anything like that
I'm taking my favorite benefit roller
lash mascara I think those videos had a
great in-between of high end in
drugstore products and as you know
there's so many mascaras from the
drugstore that work beautifully I just
have been using this one a lot lately so
I'm just going to coat
I'm going to do the other side Wow and
lastly to finish off the whole look I
just do my lips so I'm using my EOS what
is it's just chopstick yeah this has
been my favorite it is the Too Faced
melted liquid or liquefied long wearing
lipsticks these are my favorite things
ever it's in the shade melted nude
so that is it for this everyday makeup
