today's video I'm doing my everyday make
a tutorial
I know it's kind of similar to my
brother simple look but this has been so
requested lately I think people just
kinda want to see it my everyday
products would have been using when it's
been loving so I decided to sit down and
somewhat free wise I hope you enjoy this
video if you do make sure to subscribe
give a thumbs up I mean if you want kind
of really cool she's getting really wing
but I'm hoping if you guys enjoy it and
let's get started when I do my makeup on
an everyday basis I really made sure my
skin is like super fresh and ready for
makeup basically I exfoliate with like a
scrub and a cleanser and then I go on to
take a really nice moisturizer I talked
about this recently in my favorites
video but it's it cosmetics confidence
in the cream is so good and so hydrating
so basically without it but um yeah I
just love using this on my face because
it makes my foundation and concealer go
on like really nice that's kind of hot
so can obviously keep cool them yeah
okay so after my moisturizer is gone ah
I love going in with an eye cream this
is my benefit it's potent eye cream and
I just kind of apply this all over under
my eye also bring it up on my eyelids
and lastly just to like really
rejuvenate my face I use my renews open
a jar hydrating mist by philosophy fluff
up stuff okay sorry I'm not trying to
like be sexy it's really hot in here
so once my skin is completely hydrated
it depends with what I'm doing that day
sometime if it's really like going to be
a long day more makeup all day or going
with a primer but usually I just kind of
use my moisturizer and like a hydration
of my skin to prime it's not make any
fuss so if I was just a normal everyday
kind of quick day not staying on all
night I go right in with foundation if
they're like I'm loving it slightly this
is the Tarte rainforest of the sea
water foundation the reason I really
like this is because it's a water-based
foundation so it's really lightweight
you guys know I live by the it cosmetics
CC cream but I'm switching it up to you
guys because I just used a little bit of
this and I kind of just like drop it on
my face oh I know it's a little bit the
most convenient but it's really nice I'm
also in the shade light/medium neutral
and a fake tan right now just so you
know I just picked kind of any like
little kabuki brush like a round top and
I was kind of like blend this all over
my face I've been really loving lately
doing it with a brush first and then
going in with a Beauty Blender and
blending the foundation up with a
blender after that the foundation
grizzle is so pretty if you have a kind
of dry skin in just water base it's
really nice also if your skin is nice
and hydrated before it looks really a
little bit on my with just pieces
so once those kind of evenly blended I
just gone with my Beauty Blender and
could I like press in any of the excess
I'm now going to go in with my new
favorite concealer this is the Tarte
shaped cake concealer I heard so much
about this on YouTube and some reason
it's just taken me a really long time to
get around using it but I've been
worried about this is on YouTube but
people use a lot of this product like
we'll go full triangle and I think it
works best if you just do like a little
bit because if it is thicker but it
doesn't feel quick so it's not like a
thick concealer but it definitely is
like more full coverage so I don't like
doing like but you know enemies so I
should like do a little bit I know it's
not a little bit for some people but I
guess in my trans have a little bit a
little bit I just take my Beauty Blender
I've actually been using a morphe sponge
I'll have it linked down below because
it's way more affordable going to be
better but I can't find it so
I'm just taking a little bit of my Laura
Mercier translucent powder and I'm not
thinking that I am taking it on my
beauty blogger and just directly
pressing it under my eyes this is just
going to make sure it lasts like all day
and you only do it under my eyes with
tiny tiny bit so it doesn't crease to do
it right away my nose a little bit so
lately I've been loving that Kula
quickie contour stick by benefit which
is like a really pretty color and it
looks really nice one inch and just like
to add a little extra so I love doing
like a little cream contour I prefer
doing this because it looks really
natural on the skin instead of just
going straight in with powders this is
personal preference I use a desk angle
brush spray a little spray and I just
blend it out and then product blend so
my three with a brush it also blends
really nicely and if you spray your
brush a little bit and I also already
have kind of a smaller forehead you
usually put bronze up there if you want
to kind of make your appearance above
your forehead look a little bit tinier
but since I have a pretty big bit of
three head um I just do it to warm up my
skin let me spread my camera after I do
that I go on with my cream highlighter
one last time before I do a cream
highlight I love it spraying my
hydrating mist if you guys on a cheaper
alternatives you'll know my Mario
Badescu is like my favorite thing in the
world but I don't want it next to me
right now so this looks like a favorite
actually is like Thai but I'm gonna
it
but I'll hold that feels on my skin and
I use this all the time again I know
this kind of seems like a repetitive
video but lately it's been requested and
I get this richer concealer foundation
everyday base
so I felt like it was cool to show you
guys what I do but I love my benefit
walks of piling stick I use just my
finger now excuse my beauty brother but
now I just used my finger because it
really melts the product and like looks
really healthy on the skin Cleveland's
upward
in the life so border
always if it my nose because I think
it's like the cutest thing
he was it right now and it just
highlighted it so I'll kind of reverse
it so with all I lift also I forgot to
do what I've been loving to do lately or
reliving I like to just pump out my
highlighter with my blender just so it's
like a little bit natural but nothing
crazy this is what I forgot to do that I
love doing where'd it go
oh no so one of you I also love doing a
little bit of this quicky contour stick
um I know this is like kind of fate I
stick a little on my finger there's like
water right there and blended it kind of
Wick my lip just like looks a little
powder okay so since I usually switch my
brows I always do a powder or a pencil
the first thing I always do is I just
brush them up like so and my eyebrows
are really uneven like this one's kind
of more square and this one's a little
bit more arched and as like a missing
part my eyebrow so the first thing I go
god
featuring parents and their me hate it I
always the first thing to do is just
fill in that little gap I just take my
eyes off your bra is in the shade medium
brown and just kind of like make that
have a ball and then is just brush it
out so that's the first step just so it
looks a little bit more normal
I try and like arch this one a little
bit to make them even but I learned to
just embrace on my eyebrows are never
going to be even and I'm really the only
one that pays attention to it so if you
feel that way nobody else probably
notices so probably everyone know this
to help weird my brows are since I put
it on YouTube underneath but okay yeah
and then what I like to do just to fill
them and make them a little bit more
natural is going with my Sigma brow
powder and a medium brown and I just
kind of mix both so shade tap them off
and using an honest audience
number 12 just a little angled brush
with a spoolie and I just kind of like
do the front half a little bit like
nothing crazy do you see how like that
is like I'm hardly touching it and then
I just kind of like push the product
upward good
and then I just thought some in place
with this brow gel from Mary Kay its
return but a really little bottle but it
lasts a long time so after that I
finally move on to the eyes I feel like
you Bergen get on me because I do not
into my eyes and people are going to
saying I do the same looks every day
which is basically warm come around my
crease but you guys asked for videos
listening some people want to see it
right before I do my eyes are just going
to take my Charlotte Tilbury powder and
with any sort of brush that's clean I
just kind of powered my eyes down for
the shot the love dipping it in at my
Bobbi Brown bronzing powder in the shade
golden light because it was my perfect
pre shade and I just literally blend
with my crease so I just blend them out
and what I've been loving recently in
signs of taking a flat shader brush and
I pick the same product and I just place
it all over my lid and this is kind of
like add a little bit more dimension and
it's kind of like makes it look a little
bit more smoky but nothing creepy I
basically just take a little smudge
brush put a little bit on here and smoke
out that lower lash line just the tiny
bit I'm also just going to take my
charlotte tilbury now how to really
quickly and just that I can see my
laughs line starting to come through
so I'm just going to set the rest my
face
really quickly Popeyes I just want to
finish off the face with what I normally
do I'm going to be taking my Marc Jacobs
it's a massive powder like this this
stuff last you till probably next year
uh-huh I'm just going to take this I'm
kind of like a tapered fluffy brush and
I just pack a little bit this on and
just kind of like go around the
perimeters of my cheeks
I like how I don't don't have enough to
smell really good I like that I can just
really think I don't have to be too
right-handed but it like comes out like
a really perfect mouth it's like kind of
weird like specific and what's not is
but once augustana taking my Marc Jacobs
lush and libido that's what it's called
it's elicit perfectly pink blush I just
used like a little bit yes Olivia put
color on your cheeks now you've been
around for a while you're probably
shocked and finally I take a little bit
of my powder highlight and champagne pop
just grab the new one
very happy about it and just like a
little fan brush of some sort this stuff
is a lot so I just like oh literally a
little goes a long way just a little bit
like that and then I have blend it out
with my Beauty buzzer right so now I
like to do my eyes I typically try into
a winged line the one eyeliner but it's
still a constant struggle for me so I'm
going to attest to this every time I do
my makeup when I go out I always do my
wind eyeliner but it takes years so the
first thing I normally do is just start
with a straight line attempt to connect
it okay I know it's perfect
okay so it kind of did it I'm going to
leave it because every time I try and
fix it I mess up when I come up scare
around it looks a little bit better they
look a little bit even so let's just
create and do this to my other eye this
one's a little bit more messed up it's
like kind of awkward
but I want to throw on my better than
sex mascara and just literally the only
musk I have used since like forever I'm
going to plot a lot of that and then see
what I have to adjust because sometimes
our must be Rosanna
it looks ok so let's going to go how
don't worry about it like getting on my
lashes I just let it dry and then take a
few tip and kind of like like of the web
throughout do my lower lashes everyday I
kind of go between two lip glosses so I
want to show you both this first one is
my chanel gloss timer in the shade one
eight nine I'll try to find this and
link down below this is my perfect gloss
doesn't add color to my lip it just
makes them look really nice kind of
subtle it's beautiful and then and I
anyways it's always good questions
what's in my lip and then I have this
buxom it kind of like a plumping one in
White Russian a black some clumsy looks
a little bit so that is why I'm going to
go for the buxom one today um and it's
so pretty
thanks so much for watching guys I hope
you enjoyed it this is the final look
and let me know you are getting makeup
look what you use what you've been
loving and I will few minutes today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
