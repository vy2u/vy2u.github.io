hope you guys are having a wonderful
Sunday today I'm a really exciting video
I'm going to be talking to you guys
about what I've been loving for the fall
I know we've just kind of gotten into
fall so what is a better way to kick off
this fall season what's the better way
to kick off than making a video about
mostly like fall clothing must-haves and
speaking of clothing everybody is always
asking me to sell my clothes I don't
really know how to go about this I
didn't know how to sell clothes and then
I made myself a deep pop account I've
heard this all over YouTube
you can buy and sell your clothes like
SuperDuper easily so you know that's my
calling because I'm lazy and I'm too
lazy to upload it online somewhere or
something I don't know any other ways
but I am so excited this is like the
most convenient way for me it's all from
an app download it it looks this is what
the app looks like it's that's Center
one life hates me so I'm just gonna put
a picture of what that looks like
high profile name is at Olivia Jade
beauty and I'm so excited I'm going to
be posting all my clothes on here I'll
show you a couple pieces that I'm
putting on D problem not gonna show all
of them so you can go on my actual
account to find all the pieces that I'm
putting on there but I will show you
I'll try in like two or three pieces
right now to show you an idea of what
I'll be selling
I'll leave a link in the description if
you guys want to download it let's get
into my fall fashion phase and like a
couple makeup products hi first fashion
must-haves for this fall season are
ankle boots 100% you need a good pair of
ankle boots I'll try and find some to
link down below for you guys but you
know sometimes I say that and I forget
so just remind me uh-huh
but these are from oh cool they don't
have the name on them
I know I got them on Urban Outfitters
these you can these are like really just
simple black boots that you can get
anywhere but they're really comfortable
and they look really cute with sweater
dresses and t-shirt dresses and they
look really cute with shorts and they
look really cute with like old boyfriend
jeans rolled up or not old vintage come
on Ellie I get with it okay next for a
part of my favorites this sounds a
little bit weird and I know in summer
everybody's always saying drink a lot of
water but I really do think all year
round you should be drinking tons and
tons of water and personally for me
something that keeps me motivated to be
like drinking water all the time is
having my own water bottle with me um so
this is the best water bottle on the
planet and it is from a company called
swell and it literally I roll my
lipstick my water is still cold from
this morning so um swell is balm I love
their water bottles it's a huge fall
necessity I know that's random you guys
are just like she's weird for putting a
water bottle in her like fall fashion
beauty faves whatever but you gotta do
what you got to do to get good skin to
feel hydrated to feel healthy and um I
love those bottles because they're the
only ones that keep my bought my bottle
my water cold okay let's switch it up so
I'm in it I'm gonna I'm gonna try and
speak English that's what I try to do so
I'm going to talk to you guys a little
bit about my beauty favorites before we
switch back into fashion but one thing I
want to talk about is this blush okay a
lot of beauty stuff in my hands this
blush by Too Faced called the love flush
in Baby Love and it's just this really
really gorgeous
kind of subtle peachy pink color and it
kind of has like an undertone of like a
rose purple and it's not purple to the
point where it's like purple on your
cheeks or anything like that it's just
like a really really nice beautiful
subtle shade and it looks so perfect in
the fall time it kind of just gives that
extra pinky bronze look so this has been
like a fall must-have for me I literally
sometimes will just apply like a really
light BB cream and this little blush and
it does wonders you have no idea okay
next my obsession has been one of the
Kylie lip glosses in the shade light I
love this umm the applicator is really
good I heard a lot of reviews
saying that it was sticky but I think
since I got a newer version it has been
improved just like a really stunning
Brown nude color perfect for fall again
as you can tell I'm really into a dark
brownish nudes so if you can't tell I'm
kind of obsessed with lip colors this
fall this one is by Lime Crime in the
shade wicked and this is like the
perfect berry purple this one is just
really beautiful and it's like the most
perfect berry color if you guys know any
berry colors that you've been loving
please leave without don't look please
leave it down below I've heard a lot of
reviews about Latin crime apparently
something someone scammed them or no
they scammed people which I'm not a fan
of so I do want to try other products
because obviously I don't want to use
products that people are getting scammed
with and that's not cool but I don't
have an issue getting this I go on and
off the Urban Outfitters website and I
love how it dries matte and it doesn't
feel sticky or it doesn't feel too dry
um it's just a really good shade and a
really good color and I can't say I've
worn it enough to the point to be like I
love the formula it lasts all day I
don't really know the information behind
that but I do love this color for fall
oh my god I almost forgot the most
important fall favorite I almost forgot
literally I swear to you the most
important product am i stupid I'll
answer that yep this morphe 35o palette
55 f means 35 fall I believe and it is
holy this was sent down by the guy
upstairs
you know I'm saying but for real this
isn't a stunning palette ever I'm
opening this on a white carpet so me
okay I've used it all my eyes today I do
a good job
probably not but I'm hello this girl
what Wow this palette is stunning it has
the most gorgeous shimmer shades fourth
fall and then the whole bottom row is
matte so you can have a variety of good
crease shades and I am so excited to
film tutorials on this but what I love
about morphe is that it isn't that that
expensive for how pigmented and how many
colors are that comes in this palette
and it is literally incredible so I'm
going to link this down below of course
you guys have to check it out if you're
looking for a really good new palette
this could last you fall spring winter
and summer because it does have really
like Gold's that could go for summer it
has the really pretty fall purple and
winter purple and rose gold and browns
and bronzy shades and the the
transitions all the matte shades at the
bottom are just really neutral so all
this ass honey boat obsessed right
so my next fall favorite is this
incredible bomber jacket by brandy
Melville and um I think everybody just
kind of needs a bomber jacket for the
fall time they are obviously super in
and they're super trendy and people just
throw them over anything and it kind of
just makes your outfit look really put
together you can get cheap ones from
anywhere I'm sure you can find like five
dollar ones online somewhere but this
one is from brandy melville and I love
the material because it's soft it's a
little bit oversized and I think the
detail on the back is a little extra and
it just makes it look a little bit cuter
so this is one of my phone must have
it's not this jacket in specific but you
got to get yourself a bomber if you're
looking for a good fall jacket okay I
don't know if you remember but this
wasn't a haul way back when and it is
this really long gray sweater from ASOS
and it is thick and trying to show you
it it looks like this has the sleeves
and it goes all the way down and this
jacket is or sweater is incredible on
it is so soft and cozy and you just need
one of these really long kind of duster
sweaters um for the fall time because it
literally makes you feel like you are
wrapped in a blanket we have to boy get
that's really really comfortable and
it's really cozy and it keeps you warm
and it makes your outfit look super cute
and then I'm going to finish off my fall
must-haves with two sweaters both from
brandy melville both the same styles in
different colors the first one is this I
believe it's called the Olli sweater but
I'll try and link it down below and it's
just this knit tan one I think this is
so beautiful and I think this would look
really cute um with vintage Levi's
high-waisted like boyfriend jeans or
whatever they're called don't really
know um and then I have the exact same
one in light blue this colors really
cute and it's just really girly in this
baby blues one of my all-time favorite
colors and it's just a knit material so
that is it for my fall fashion
must-haves if you guys would be gems and
dolls and beautiful little children and
