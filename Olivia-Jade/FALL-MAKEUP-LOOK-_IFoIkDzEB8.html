I'm just gonna hop right into the video
and it's a fall makeup look with a bold
lip so I'm starting out with the
Maybelline BB cream and an expert face
brush by Real Techniques and I'm just
blending that all over my face just give
an even look and then I'm taking the
Urban Decay Naked concealer and I'm
plying that under my eyes on my burn
above my eyebrow because I burn myself
with a curling iron and then I'm just
blending that out with my finger then
I'm taking hoola bronzer by benefit and
I'm contouring with that I'm really just
warming up my face and just giving
myself kind of a structured look and
then I'm taking two-faced blush and all
the shades and names will be linked down
below but I'm just kind of sculpting the
apples of my cheeks and then I'm taking
the morphe palette and taking that first
shade and just blending it right into
the crease it's kind of a purpley color
so this is our transition shade and this
eye look is so simple I'm then taking a
maroon purple color and also blending
that into the crease and then a super
unprofessional trick is just taking a
huge like huge brush and just blending
all the shadows together and then taking
two golds on a pencil brush and just
putting that on the inner corner and
kind of in the middle of the lid but
kind of keeping it more towards the
inner corner and then I'm taking that
purple and placing it on the outer
corner in the outer third where we
didn't really fill in and then I'm
taking the Gold's on the pencil brush
just the leftover and dragging that on
my lower lash line and then I'm just
taking a really thin line of black
liquid eyeliner
after that I'm taking my Maybelline
I think sensational mascara I'll link it
down below and I'm just coating my lash
it was oh my shoes with that and then
after I'm done with that I'm just taking
a spoolie with no product on it and just
brushing my eyebrows back just to make
them look a little bit more tamed and
even but I'm really not even doing
anything to them and then I'm taking a
liquid and I'll link all the products
down below as I've said and I wasn't a
huge fan of how I did my lips I don't
know something was missing they weren't
intense enough but then I just took the
melted lipstick in the shade in from Too
Faced and I just put up that on the
outer corners for an ombre effect and
then I highlighted with champagne pop
and a blush brush just to kind of
complete the look and that's it
thanks so much for watching and I will
see you guys in the next one right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
