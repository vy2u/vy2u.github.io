welcome back happy Sunday hope you guys
are having a really great morning or
night day we're whenever you're watching
this
today I have filmed a full outfits of
the leaked I just kind of want to jump
straight into this video and show you
guys all they're really cute fall
outfits that I have this works if you're
in really hot weather or really warm
other--and you can modify it to whatever
climate you guys live in a really cute
outfit and so excited so let's get
started so for Monday's outfit this is
kind of perfect if it's fall in a hot
climate but you guys can wear jeans if
it's cold where you live the sweater is
from H&amp;amp;M and I believe they still have
it so I'll try and link it down below if
I can find it or something similar the
shorts are from one teaspoon my favorite
boots are from Zara these are my fall
clothing haul in literally so many
videos and I just really love this
outfit I think it's really cute and
comfortable and cozy and I think it's
also really chic
so for Tuesday's outfit I decided to go
way more relaxed and casual this little
two-piece jump kind of set the
sweatpants in the sweatshirt are from a
store on Melrose but I will try and link
it down below if I can find it the
glasses are glasses usa.com and I
actually have glasses on every single
outfit because I'm going to be doing a
whole video with glasses soon so look
out for that and then the shoes are just
white converse so for Wednesday starting
with my face I have my glasses USA
glasses on and then I have my sweater my
little turtleneck from Brandi the skirt
is also from brandy melville and then I
also decided to pair this little getup
with some black boots which you'll see
in now and I think it's just really cute
and casual and kind of perfect for fall
with the colors and the turtleneck and
everything like that so for Thursday's
outfit again glasses of course have been
obsessed I don't actually need glasses I
use them as a style choice which I know
some people might think is ridiculous
but my sweater is brandy melville my
jeans are rag-and-bone and I got them on
sale
ages ago and then I just throw on my
white converse to complete the look
so for Friday I'm wearing the same jeans
from rag-and-bone and then my top is
brandy melville once again I swear it's
almost answered by anyone or brandy
melville I just really like their
clothing um glasses once again and then
I also wearing really fun shoes they
basically just have like two pom-poms on
there and they're totally crazy and fun
so I will link those down below for
shirt I don't remember the name off to
calm my head
but I love them thank you so so much for
watching I love you guys I hope you
enjoyed this video if you did give it a
thumbs up it means the world and
subscribe and I'll see you guys next
time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
