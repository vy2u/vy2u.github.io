welcome back to my youtube channel if
you're new here what's up
I'm Olivia I'm 18 and make youtube
videos but today I am going to be
talking about my February favorites
fashion and makeup you guys did February
go by so freaking fast for anyone else
like I feel like I didn't even live
through February just feel like it was
over so it's crazy but happy March I'm
gonna guess it is a shorter month but
still I don't understand how that really
happened if you guys want to see what
I've been loving for them on the
February then just keep watching and I
hope you all enjoy so the first thing
I'm gonna start with are like the
skincare and the makeup really quick I'm
not gonna spend hours talking about them
I'll like punch through this because you
know I don't want to bore you
self-tanner is a very big necessity for
me personally I talk about this all the
time on my channel so I'll keep it short
but I use the loving tan deluxe bronzing
mousse in the shade ultra dark for my
tan I basically also use the mint love
this combo it makes me so happy I do
like one to two layers of the ultra dark
and I'm like my ideal tan and the worst
part about self-tanning is removing it
all because of like clicking and like
patchiness and like you know like under
your armpits where it gets like super
white and then everything else is dark
which is like me at the moment this is
the Bondi sans the Australian tan
self-tanner racer you just put this all
over your body before you get in the
shower and you let it like soak into
your skin for five minutes and then when
you go in the shower you take like a
towel rub it all off your tan comes off
and then you can repeat your cycle so
then I go back in with my self tanner
and then like a week and a half and it
looks like I go with this so next up I
want to talk about some face masks I
also feel like I've mentioned this on my
channel I swear the other stuff I
haven't mentioned but I feel like I have
mentioned this and they're the support
collection sheet masks these are pretty
affordable and I love
because it's the thing where I noticed
like instant change in my skin basically
so my favorite is the purl one because
it's brightening so it's literally
gorgeous it makes my skin feel like
super luminous but I really like this
one too it's the Lotus face mask it's
moisturizing and soothing and then I
believe this was pomegranate yeah this
month anti fatigue and energizing and
basically you just put this on for 15
minutes
chill out watch a video read your book
whatever you do and then when you take
them off your skin is glowing and you
look like a Victoria's Secret Angel who
doesn't want that next up we need to
talk about this this is the best thing
ever
well both of these I also lost the cap
to one so I found this and I just stuck
it on there these are the bite agave lip
masks I have it in the shade champagne I
believe this I don't know the shade
names it or link them down below it's
like the more red one and then the other
like champagne is one I think in
Champagne literally incredible they are
lip colors basically but they're super
sheer and like very hydrating it's
literally a lip mask so when you put it
on it's like super moisturizing and this
one has like a more red tint so I like
this for like my no makeup days when I
just need something to pop and then this
one literally comes out like goldish
like reflection here let me see if I
could show you yeah like it comes out
like that on your lips so cool I'm
actually obsessed with it so I will
obviously link both of those down below
but I have been obsessed I have this
like pinkish one on my lips right now
with a little something else I have been
like really obsessed with milk makeup
and I think it's because how natural it
is I love the milk matte bronzer it's
like this cream bronzer and it's the
creamiest bronzer ever I feel like I
didn't love this as much when I first
got it and then the more I started to
use it I feel like the creamier it got
you know like have some highlighters you
have to like scrape off the top for it
to be like super like right so like
that's what this like it was always good
and then recently it's been like
flawless like perfect like makes my skin
super even I was having this problem
when I was putting bronzer on like it
wouldn't like stick to my cheek and this
one does you guys should give it a try
and then also this milk makeup sunshine
skin tint this is like the lightest
weight skin tint like tinted moisturizer
ever it is gorgeous that was in English
it is gorgeous it has an SPF of 30 love
both of these if you're a natural girl
won't like that fresh healthy glow
you'd be obsessed this is my Kiehl's
creamy avocado eye treatment I have gone
through a lot of eye creams and let me
just tell you and none of them do it
justice like this one so this one is
amazing because literally the second you
put it on it instantly like right into
your face up and just gives you like
this under glow I don't even know and
then also it like if you have dry under
eyes in your concealed area like kind of
dries up use this right before you put
your concealer on it'll make all the
difference I promise you trust me on
this one I've been there and I love this
I just and it's like gonna prevent you
from wrinkles in the future so if you
want to be like Proactiv then would
recommend does anyone remember this the
makeup forever Pro sculpting duo this
used to be such a vibe on YouTube you
don't know what it is it's basically a
bronzer and highlighter in one compact
and the most stunning highlighter ever
also the most amazing bronzer ever but
together do you see my cheeks so this I
just take a big brush swirl all up and
then like blend all over my face and it
gives me like this bronzy glow it's
literally perfect I seriously would
recommend I totally forgot about this
and like pulled it out of like my drawer
a few weeks ago and I was like whoa
forgot about you last makeup thing I'm
talking about is this tart tart East
daily paint oh I just read clay as daily
oh my god clay paint liner eyeliner it's
in the shade black and it is a little
gel eyeliner the only thing I hate about
this is how messy it gets but it looks
like this and you basically just squeeze
it up I wish I didn't do that I got it
all over my check
I don't even putting on my babies
anymore but anyway if you were looking
for a good eyeliner to make wings and a
little precise brush I would recommend
that but I'm not putting in any more cuz
I'm mad even though I just put it in I'm
not blinking it even though I'll
probably linking it I'm gonna go clean
up your bag hi we're back I made it
cleaned a little bit my jackets ruined
but at least it was the inside of my
jacket I don't know anyway now that our
beauty products out of the way we're
gonna get right into the fashion faves
a5 fashion favorites I want to share
with you we'll start with a jacket that
I just ruined let me show you what
happened that's the inside but the
outside is still very cozy and
comfortable this is the IMG a pixie
jacket I have it in this color I have it
in black and I just ordered it in red I
literally am obsessed with this jacket I
wear it with everything especially since
I haven't a black and tan they're both
so neutral that it goes with everything
but it's just like the biggest comfiest
warmest jacket it's like the perfect la
jacket that's what my sister and I say
cuz you couldn't wear this I don't think
in like New York by itself you need like
a few layers in the winter like it's the
perfect la winter jacket when it's like
breezy you know what I mean if you think
it's like the perfect like 50 degree
weather and right now in LA it's been
like 45 degrees and no one really knows
what's happening I've never experienced
it in my life because it's usually like
sixty five in LA in the winter it's very
comfortable
okay what's your shoes these are one of
my favorite pairs of sneakers so the
Alexander McQueen sneakers they're very
dirty they definitely need to be cleaned
I have worn these like a crazy amount of
times this month that I lost track I
can't even count on two hands or two
feet how many times I've worn these
shoes but yeah they're really dope and I
like how they're not like the basic like
platform you know like super get
everyone in freaking America has super
good platforms I'm sorry if you have
them I do too I'm dissing myself but I
just I'm over them I feel like they're
not different and these ones are
different they're also like a million
times more expensive but I got your back
I found similar ones ish that'll link
down below hello super girls are still
cute and a lot of people rock them I
just think I'm over that look people are
gonna get upset by that I hope not
alright and lastly for shoes I
I've been loving these off-white boots
they're so cool they say for walking
they're like white little ankle boots as
you can see then it has like your little
signature off white belt vibe but like
on the shoe I love these I got them for
Christmas I'm gonna link them down below
you're probably not gonna go click the
link in my description and buy these
right now because they're like $1,000
and that's crazy
I'm gonna link a similar pair down below
for you guys because I actually think
everyone deserves and needs a good white
boot and I found something kind of
similar so I got your back I actually
got a pair of forever 21 so oh it's
gonna be the first to bottom they're
probably gonna sell out pretty quick you
can wear it with denim like cutoff ankle
jeans like with the kind of like
distressed bottom you know what I mean
there's so many ways tights was like a
black skirt like those sheer see-through
tights like a little mini black skirt so
cute and like a sheer turtleneck oh
these jeans are one of my favorite pairs
of jeans I'll have a picture of them
right now so these jeans are amazing
they're like these really big baggy
boyfriend jeans that I got off of
revolve and you can cuff the bottoms if
you want if your little heart desires
but um they're so comfortable and so
cute and so flattering I love them
because they're so baggy on the bottom
that it makes your upper half look super
tiny which is awesome so that's why I
really like these they are on the more
expensive side I think I think they're
probably like $200 if I remember
correctly I did find a pair of jeans
when I was searching and like planning
out this video from boohoo but I'm gonna
link down below that I think are pretty
similar to this and are like $27 you
guys can check it off yourself and see
if I did a good job finding a dupe but
just know it really dried for you okay
who's calling me Bella no my sister hey
man what is how you do
thank anyway as I was saying these jeans
are just amazing so if you got em I
really don't know how to speak English
like it's pretty impressive at this
point just really like these so the last
thing I actually don't have possession
of right now why because number one it's
my sister's number two she has an in
college with her right now so I
literally couldn't even take it from her
closet but when she brings it home for
the weekends I wear it like all the time
I'm obsessed with it I need to order it
for myself and a bunch of other dresses
it's this realization power dress and
it's stunning it's like this beautiful
maxi dress short sleeve like navy with
the little cherries on it it is so so
cute and I wear it all the time and it's
so flattering and so beautiful and I
think it's so elegant and classy and I
actually found a few similar wrap
dresses down below that I think give the
same vibe and are super cute so I'm
gonna link in down below for a better
price so guys that is it for this video
I know it wasn't like an insane amount
of products but yeah I didn't want to
just like throw in a bunch of random
stuff that I didn't actually use
everything that I've talked about is
something that I actually are my go to
products my favorite things my favorite
clothing pieces and I don't know what I
would have done this month without
having them because I probably would
have had a fashion breakdown mental
breakdown and skincare breakdown and
makeup right dog I don't even know but
anyway love these products so thank you
