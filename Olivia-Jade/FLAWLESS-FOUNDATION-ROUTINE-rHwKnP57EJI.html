today I'm doing a flawless foundation
routine I picked up some new products
this is the center of the show this is
the Too Faced Born This Way Foundation I
don't know if it's focusing but it's
amazing also as you can hear that
drilling my house is under construction
so I tried to talk when the drilling has
gone off but if you hear little drills
and noise people and men talking it's
just construction workers at the moment
it's off now so let's jump into this
video I really hope you guys enjoy my
flawless foundation routine in a way
shape form am I saying I know what I'm
doing or my makeup artist or you know
I'm flawless like by the title that's
not talking about me it's just talking
about how the I just see people title
this okay I don't really know but I hope
you I hope you guys enjoy this
foundation routine and let's get started
okay so the first thing I'm doing is I'm
starting with a moisturizer this is my
Chanel love solution 10-date Chanel
moisturizer I'm obsessed with this they
actually allowed me to come by their
store in Beverly Hills and they put
together a little goodie bag for me I
like their new makeup product so so I've
been just trying this out so I'm just
putting one pump of that and then just
rubbing that into my skin this feels so
good and hydrating there's so many
amazing moisturizers that are not Chanel
obviously but yeah also I have a little
construction going on in my house right
now so if you hear people down there
working away sorry for my crazy hair
this was from a lot like that I'm then
going in with my makeup forever step one
skin equalizer primer this stuff is
amazing it just totally smooths out your
skin and makes foundation super easy to
put on so I just put a little on the
back of my hand
like that and then I just kind of pick
it up rub it in between and just apply
it like especially where I like larger
pores just kind of around there oh then
I just bring a little up on my forehead
as well and then after I do that I just
go straight in with my foundation my
favorite way to apply a foundation is
with a Beauty Blender or sponge
or a kabuki brush my all-time favorite I
think is a beauty blender because I
think it blends out the most natural so
I'm using my Too Faced Born This Way
Foundation this stuff is incredible it's
so buildable but it also gives you just
eight it feels really light okay I just
wet I just stay at my Beauty Blender
with a little water and then wring it
out but a Real Techniques sponge which
it's a little bit cheaper is also
amazing I love using that mine are dirty
at the moment so I'm not using it but
I'm just kind of applying I don't really
have a specific way I kind of like
applying it to my face and then blending
it out because I kind of find what I
apply it straight to my Beauty Blender
it kind of almost soaks it up and then I
don't get as much product on my face one
pump at the most oh gosh this is looking
a little light for my skin
oh well bronze and then I just take my
Beauty Blender and Pat it up
as you can build it up so much but it
also just gives you the most natural
beautiful even coverage I am the biggest
fan of this foundation you will for sure
see this in an upcoming favourites if
you guys want me to do favorite videos
again also my hair I'm so sorry it's
just being cray-cray but you know ignore
it I use my naked skin Urban Decay
concealers I use my I use two shades and
I mix them with this tan because I can't
find a good one for my skin tone right
now but I'm going to start with medium
light because hopefully this works right
now but this might be the actual yeah so
this isn't that light but I just apply
like that and then a little on this side
and kind of where I usually get a little
redness which is just around my mouth
that's the product like I need to cover
and then just under my eyes what I'm
going to do is take my shade light worn
by naked and then just apply this right
under my eyes just to brighten the color
a little bit so it highlights um what I
love about this concealer is it is so
light that it doesn't really feel like
you have anything on your face and it
blends out so naturally
notice how it's also in a triangle form
this is to highlight and conceal and
just to brighten your skin some people
think this is a little much but I like
it just makes me feel a little bit more
awake and the combination I'm not
kidding if you really I've never had a
foundation so beautiful settle so well
and is so light I'm freaking out about
this this is incredible so these are
amazing because they're all such
lightweight products that it doesn't
really feel like you have any makeup on
your face which is hands-down my
favorite thing ever and I feel like well
people have trouble trusting like young
kids obviously because obviously I'm
going to school for makeup but honestly
just from like trying so many different
products I promise I would never lie
about that like you can completely trust
me this is the best combo ever I'm going
to do some research and I will link it
below if I can find something for dupes
for both these products because I know
they're expensive and high-end Sephora
so if you guys can't afford them I don't
want you to feel like you can't ever get
this look with lightweight product so
down below I'm going to try and find the
nearest dupes for high-end drugstore
drugstore versions of these products
just cuz I love you after this I just
like to set it because these are both
Korean products that foundation and
concealer you definitely want to make
sure it's not going to move throughout
the day I'm going to take this kind of
concealer brush here and just focus on
setting where where I can see I'm just
going to focus that setting powder I'm
just using stay matte finally a
drugstore products Thank You Olivia but
yeah I'm just pressing that under I just
take my Revlon nearly naked and then
just this big fluffy tapered brush and I
just kind of press this over my skin I'm
actually going to end up bronzing with
this brush too so I use powder first
this brush is my life I love it this is
the Sigma tapered face at 25 brush Sigma
brushes are my favorite you guys know or
I don't know if you do know but I always
have a link down below to Sigma brushes
or use their website in general because
are actually my favorite things ever I'm
going to use my this is not a part of my
foundation routine but I just thought
I'd show you so we cannot color back
into our face I'm using my Kat Von D
shade and light palette and we're just
taking the first two shades these ones
and just mixing them together just like
back on your awesome tap it off and then
lightly contouring not like taking a
harsh line and then contouring literally
SH going like this and that tapered
brush gives you that nice fine line and
then I'm just going to blend up to get
me color
and then I'm just going to show you
highlighting because you guys know
highlighting is my all-time favorite
thing I'm just using my Mac soft and
gentle highlight this is just such a
nice pretty pinkish white highlight I
love it I'm just taking that on my
tapered brush again and then applying it
right to the tops of my cheekbones this
just gives you such a pretty glow and
it's so easy especially with this brush
this brush is so multi-purpose and
obsessed but yeah so I'm just kind of
putting that where I want a highlight
which is just this kind of Center I did
not mean to highlight that much on my
forehead but hey what the hell why not
it looks fun you know but yeah that's it
for my flawless base foundation contour
highlight kind of thing and I recently
did a highlight and contour video which
will be linked down below along with my
everyday makeup routine so you guys can
just see but a lot of products have
switched up so yeah that's it for my
flawless foundation highlight and
contour kind of situation I didn't
actually know I was going to do the
whole highlight and contour in here but
it was just really basic super simple
and easy all with one brush so yeah as I
said I will find dupes to all these
products and like them down below so you
guys can test them out and let me know
how you guys like them I will do serious
research for you guys thank you so much
for watching I love you guys all and I
will see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
