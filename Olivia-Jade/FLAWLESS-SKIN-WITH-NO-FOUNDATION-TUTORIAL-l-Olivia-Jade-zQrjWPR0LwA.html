welcome back to another YouTube video in
today's video as you can tell my channel
I am showing you how to get a flawless
beautiful stunning base without wearing
a drop of foundation your skin or my
skin in this case looks so healthy and
glowy and pretty and I'm not wearing any
foundation and it doesn't feel heavy and
I just feel like I'm wearing my normal
face normal skin and I really wanted to
share that with you guys so if you're
gonna hear it make sure to subscribe and
give this video a thumbs up five-second
challenge to subscribe you have five
seconds
timers right there five four three I'm
probably counting around these into how
many seconds if you guys want to see
this look then just keep watching and I
really hope you enjoy it so wagging it
you are creating a flawless face or
something that you don't want to look
cakey or thick or anything really you
just want to look flawless and naturally
like it's your natural skin I am really
good news you don't have to wear
foundation so the first thing I want to
talk about that is so important is
priming moisturizing skin care all the
stuff before you actually start putting
your face makeup on completely it
changes what your skin is going to look
like in the end today I've chosen to use
the Bobbi Brown vitamin enriched face
base this stuff is amazing it's so thick
and creamy so it really just kind of
like melts into your skin and makes your
skin and the makeup and everything go on
like butter which is amazing so I'm just
gonna take a little bit of that just
gonna warm this product up in my hands
and then put this all over my skin so
once that is done I cream is one of my
favorite things in the world what do you
like an ice cream or an eye serum or
whatever it is I don't think you have to
buy these exact products I'm using just
something but you have already or
something that
you really like this one I'm gonna go in
with is the fresh supreme eye serum
looks like this I'm just gonna take a
few little drops and then go in with the
ring finger this is your most gentle
finger I go through so many skincare
steps when doing like a no foundation
look because number one you're not
wearing foundation so your skin has to
look flawless without wearing foundation
so you have to do all these other steps
to ensure you're gonna feel healthy and
feel glowy and it's gonna look glowy
primer super important I really love
this Becca a first light priming filter
it kind of has like this lilac tone to
it
I think this almost brightens your skin
it's kind of a weird thing but I just do
a couple pumps of that on my hand and I
rub this all over my face
and once you think you primed enough and
put enough moisturizer and stuff on your
face you probably haven't you can either
take Mac strobe cream if you have it or
this is one from the drugstore it's the
L'Oreal magic lumi light infusing
perfecting primer you guys these
products are literally the same thing in
my opinion they're so similar
I'm gonna go in with the drugstore one
because it's cheaper I'm just gonna use
my finger for this and I'm applying this
to the areas you want to highlight a
little bit and bring glow see how I
skipped right over my zit I normally
would apply this all over my cheeks but
I don't really want to highlight my
blemish okay now my face looks a little
bit lighter than my body I have a lot of
glow to me and we need to start covering
up the zits and the blemishes and the
burns
I'm gonna take my concealers I'm using
two shades I have two shades light
neutral and the shade light/medium and
I'm gonna start by applying the shade
light neutral under my eyes too can't
slap the dark circles whatever we've got
going on under there and then I'm gonna
go in with my other shade and really
lightly just cover spots I don't want to
see so that's pretty much everywhere
that I want to cover and then I have a
really awesome trick for you if you need
to cover like specific blemishes or
anything like
anything like a flat shader brush would
work great because you want to blend out
the product around your actual mark or
blemish or anything you never want to
touch your actual blemish so it stays
covered and then I go in with that
beauty blender and I blend all around it
I really drive the product out I really
try and get it to be nothing and then I
just take the remainder and kind of
blend all over my skin just so it's like
the same tone okay so now for the
concealer I'm just gonna blend this out
like I normally would
doing this side and then this side back
to this side going back to this side so
it's evenly distributed so as you can
see my little friend is still here so
I'm just gonna Spock until that with the
darker color a little bit of that on
there and then I like to wipe off the
brush you can wipe it on a towel
somebody on my Beauty Blender cuz I'm
lazy and just go around literally just
like that then powder so important I
take that same little shader brush and I
pack on the powder literally just like
that I go right on top of it and I let
it sit for a little bit this Laura
Mercier powder is literally one of my
favorites I love it I never think it
makes me look cakey but if we're going
for this more natural look I don't want
to bake it so I'm just tapping a tapered
brush in there and lightly blending out
the concealer
we're not money we're just padding in
powder don't like wipe your face and
then I like to go in and just Pat in the
rest of the powder we put it on the face
see we don't even have foundation on and
our skin actually looks so airbrushed
and the best part is you don't look
cakey since we didn't place any
concealer or foundation or anything on
those direct spots
it doesn't look cakey it's it's
literally your skin and it looks
flawless my favourite trick
okay so tourim the cheeks I like to go
in with cream products I'm going in with
this NYX wonder stick this is super
affordable it's just a contour stick and
since this is cream again it's not going
to look powdery it's just going to kind
of melt into your skin then I like doing
this on a damp Beauty Blender so it
really just blends in and looks like
your
yes honey is about what we all want the
answer is yes you're just kind of like
pushing and pouncing I've got another
drugstore fave this is my next bright
idea illuminating snake I love this
highlighter because it's not sparkly or
glittery or anything like that it's
actually like that inner glow it's kind
of like the benefit walks up or the milk
makeup stick highlight so I just like to
apply this all over my fingers like my
three fingers right there and literally
just press that into your skin it looks
so beautiful and glowy right on the nose
and then just for the holiday I'm going
to place a little bit of this mixed
stuff in my inner corners again it looks
so natural and then I'm going to spray
my face with my morphe prep and set
makeup setting spray and then to finish
off the look I'm going in with this
ultra glossy lip kathleenlights x color
pop I use this in my last video and I
found another fit so guys this isn't the
finished look thank you so much for
watching I hope this helped you out if
you thought the only way you could look
flawless and feel beautiful was in
foundation I hope I proved you wrong
because I used to think that too I
thought the only way I could feel
comfortable and actually feel like my
skin looked perfect was when I was
wearing foundation and as you can tell
or at least in my opinion I think this
proves that you can just do the absolute
bare minimum and still feel super
confident and healthy and glowy looking
thank you for watching if you guys are
new here make sure to subscribe it means
so much to me also leave video requests

time
