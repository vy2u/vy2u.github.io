this really fun crazy video and it's the
highlighter challenge as you can tell by
the title this was circling the internet
for a really long time um like last
month or couple weeks ago and I hope I'm
not too late I think I'm just just about
to be too late to get on this challenge
but I don't care I thought it's fun I
wanted to try it out and then let you
guys I have a peek at it so if you guys
want to see how to recreate this look
then just keep watching but seriously
this is a joke and I hope nobody thinks
I'm like genuinely serious like
highlight on fleek though am i right
okay so I'm going to mix the for my
foundation I'm going to mix the True
Match Lumi liquid glow illuminator with
this good to glow highlighter oh my god
I'm so nervous and then I'm going to
take a flat top kabuki I really should
have done them on this hand cuz it just
feels more natural okay let's go for
this okay so this just doesn't match my
skin at all oh cool
awful oh I feel like all my pores you
can just see them say like a face mask
left over in my hair oh my god no it
looks that line or gate we need to blend
better
I'm going to use this really pure gold
too because it's lighter a little bit
concealed yes I'm just concealing as bad
this is so gross this is literally after
we're done with that I'm going to set
the face I am going to so I'm going to
set the under eyes with a really light
highlight because it's going to brighten
it so this is the elf blush but it's in
got a glow which is like a really white
shimmer just pack a lot of that on there
I'm going to bake with this while I let
that bake I'm going to go in and bronze
a little and contour
so I'm going to take this shade gold
deposit which is a Mac highlight but it
is on the bronzer side so I'm going to
take this really pretty shade which not
so cute anymore and a different brush
and bronzer cheeks and contour
warm up the whole face I'm going to set
the rest of our face with this neutral
pink soft and gentle highlight and kind
of blend up here so it's a little less
bright so the rest just blend out our
face this is so scary
I'm going to wipe away the under eyes
Red's a little too bronzed but what do
you expect I'm going to take my Mac soft
and gentle highlight and a fluffy brush
and really try and highlight the tops of
my cheek bone we have to do a little bit
of blush I'm going to take this Sigma
brilliant shimmer cream and I'm going to
use this as a blush so I'm just going to
take it in the exact because I don't
want to ruin all my brushes really get
that product on a brush and blush it up
on the apples kind of bring it back a
little so actually really pretty my
whole face did look insane okay I can't
do okay I'm going to go back on to my
eyes and I'm just going to take this
fluffy brush and this bronze and blend
this into my crease as um you in a
little
going back into the crease we're going
to take a little bit of soft gentle
highlight and place this all over the
lid get a bunch on and just pack it
after we do that I'm going to use this
got a glow this really pearly white
highlight and highlight my inner corners
also because why the hell not
I'm going to highlight the brow bone my
brows are awful so I would rather not
bring attention but it's okay so after
we do that I'm going to go back in with
that fluffy crease brush and this bronzy
shade and I'm just going to blend out
the harsh uhm highlight and just kind of
make it all look soft I finish off the
eyes I'm going to go in with this Urban
Decay heavy metal eyeliner I know this
isn't like a face highlight but it is
super shimmery so I'm going to put this
on my lower and upper lash line short
with upper
I'm also going to highlight the key
pizza with this because that's hilarious
then I have he regret doing that after
we look like this I'm going to lastly
move on to the lips
I'm gonna use my Bobbi Brown bare
Sparkle high sugar glass I'm just going
to load this up my lips are nice and
like tacky for a highlight to go on top
which I'm going to use soft and gentle
and a packing brush and just
you
I'm going to call it dumb though at this
because oh my god Oh scary
this was my full face highlighter
challenge I look so I look so scary this
is like genuinely terrifying I keep
looking my viewfinder to like I look
like you guys know I love a good glow to
I'm like this is just a little bit I
hope you guys enjoyed this little funny
video um this was a trend that was going
around YouTube for a little bit in
Instagram I saw on Twitter a bunch so I
wanted to hop on the bandwagon and
become a part of the full face
highlighter challenge um thank you for
