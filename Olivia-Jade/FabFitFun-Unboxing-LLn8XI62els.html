channel today I'm filming an unboxing
haul I've done this for epsy before but
I've never done this for this particular
website if C's never contacted me just a
little disclaimer for all the other
videos a lot of people ask this website
actually did contact me I've heard about
them before they contacted me I used to
watch this other channel that always did
these fabfitfun unboxing hauls and I was
so obsessed with fabfitfun I would just
always scroll on their websites when
they emailed me I was really excited but
I never signed up and when they even me
I freaked I was I guess he says please
send me a box and now I actually am on
my own signed up without like a free
thing but they just sent me one free box
that came early so I thought I would
open it up and share with you and then
since I'm not subscribed because guys
would like me to keep up the fabfitfun
videos let me know or I can just keep it
to Ipsy whatever you guys want but I'm
not getting paid to make this or
anything like that they just sent me the
box and I really wanted to open it for
you guys um so yeah this video is not
sponsored I'm just like kind of in
collaboration with them um but yeah I'm
not getting money out of it I just got
this Reeboks that I want to share with
you but I am signed up anyway so it's
not really free so let's dig in it's
called fabfitfun and it's a you know
what it's dudes if you watch my other
videos it's like a subscription website
where they send you stuff once a month
after you're signed up and they add I
think I don't know how much of this is
per month
well okay they have a little menu of
everything I wish if she did that but
would be awesome it tells you the price
of them everything like that that's a
really cool so it has like a little menu
of what comes in the box
woo this is continuous spray Vaseline
intensive care spray moisturizer aloe
smooth so it moisturizes and absorbs and
seconds to help heal dry skin non-greasy
oh you spray it on your body
okay so it doesn't leave your skin
sticky or anything like that but it's
supposed to just moisturize your skin
and make your skin smooth you spray it
all over you hold four inches away from
skin and spray all over body and
continuous motion quickly rub into
moisturize your skin instantly fun so
let's see how much that is at retails
for $8 799 okay cool so this is about
eight bucks
I like that you'll probably end up
seeing it in a favorites video if I
don't I'm gonna let you know this is the
I'll make you look amazing daily spray
by gorge oh my god it smells like
sunscreen but like coconuts on screen
vanilla coconut I'm gonna have the best
my thing ever so what this does is it's
a conditioning spray that will turn your
hair into the sexiest hair ever
well damn who doesn't want bad repairs
damaged hair instantly add shine to
tangles like no other protects from heat
seals and protects hair color prevent
split end stops hair breakage meets
amazing silkiness enhances natural body
and helps with flat iron gee this does a
lot I'm excited this is the oh my god

smelled in my life
this retails for 2495 this is the
everyday a wireless speaker so it
completely from your iPhone or your
laptop you can recharge it obviously
little little static like a one-time use
I'm sorry if anything changed or I'm not
in great focus anymore which we think
I'm fried it's because I'm so stressful
it's because I had to my memory guys
died then I just jumped on the phone for
an interview now I'm back to the
lighting anything changed it's been like
an hour and I just left off bye
shoot I was just talking about how I got
speaker and then I'm super excited about
it
this retails for $29.99 and you get it
in your little fat fit fun boy it was
dropped it
little fabfitfun box so I'm so excited
to try this out you guys don't even know
next is this inkling sultry for women
who a fragrance squeeze be one of these
little volleyball ones I love the one
you roll okay that's the best knifing
effort
like ever okay this retails for $25
exactly so worse than it smells amazing
it's a little baby size or not it's like
that bit as you can see but yeah it's
great it smelt amazing and since it's a
rollerball and not a spray that's going
to last like an absurd amount of time
oh these little scratch limited-edition
nail wraps huge savings just for you
these are so cute these little blue ones
these retail for $12 and they're really
cute and I'm curling so put these on
boot chart chart lip gloss lip surgence

shade total opposite of what I'm wearing
on my lips right now I like super edgy
right now $19 that's the retails for 19
this is the pure white hello konjac oh
it took a little exfoliation sponge
exfoliator spongy you are an early on
watcher like back in the day when I used
to talk about the little do puffs I have
which I still use an ilink
I love my new pup this is very similar
to it it's pretty much exact same thing
$12 so they're cheap the do puffs
cheaper it's from Amazon that's what I
would get but this is okay this is part
of the fit part it comes with a jump
rope which is so cute this is probably a
little bit more expensive isn't it a $14
jump rope it's not that bad
next is this Wren what is this oh that's
beautiful
it's this beautiful gold horseshoe
necklace old horseshoe oh my god back to
gorgeous it's not like super expensive
it's $100 oh my god it's so like
delicate I love something from headspace
I have no idea what has spaces headspace
free month subscription this app takes
you through a series of life-changing
guided meditations so usually you have
to pay 38 85 for this but this card gave
me three months free so I'm gonna try
that and I'll let you guys know how it
goes
and it gives me a little code so I'm not
gonna show you so i somebody's gonna
steal my head spin what is it called
head spit it's not it
headspace code and free membership that
is everything that came in my fabfitfun
box I'll have their website link down
below if you guys don't believe me
because sometimes if you like one need
to recite that then click the link down
below they're affiliated with that link
that's how I am with Sigma if you click
the link for Sigma in the description
then I get like five or 10% of something
when you buy it or something like that
or that's also how it worked with madam
glam with me and of course I would never
use products I don't love I'm just being
honest so that's how that worked with me
but for this if you click the link I
don't get paid through it or anything
like that but if you don't trust me you
can just go to WWII vet comm or whatever
you got fun fit can I say words
fabfitfun calm and then you can sign up
yourself if you're interested I think
you pay like $40 a month or something
like that I'll have that number right
about how much you pay per month the
grand total was $275 and 79 cents so the
total for all of these products was
almost $300 but you only paid ever how
much it is and I said I'll be right here
and yeah thank you guys so much for
watching I hope you all enjoy it and if
