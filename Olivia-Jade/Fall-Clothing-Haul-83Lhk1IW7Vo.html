am filming this pretty requested video
which is a clothing haul most of this is
affordable for you guys I just want to
apologize for I haven't filmed a video
in too long of a time I actually did
film like an August favorites and then a
film something else something else
something else and then I just watched
him over and I was so unhappy with them
that I just decided not to post any of
them and so it's been a couple of my god
this airplane I've just been so busy
with school and it was just my sister's
birthday and I got my ears pierced which
was really exciting and if you're
wondering hey what's in the middle of
your face it's disgusting
long story short yesterday I was going
to the Katy Perry concert if you follow
me on Instagram I posted picture of me
and my friends before we went to concert
and I'll have my links down below so
basically I was skating down a hill and
then I fell off my penny board and I
like scraped my face and my arm which is
why I'm wearing a flannel because I
didn't want anybody to see it and my
legs and like I can't really hide it on
my face because it's like like right
there and two of my best friends were
behind me and then two of my best
friends were in front of me so the two
in front of me did not see any of this
and then the two time you saw the whole
thing go down and they thought I was
going to come up like after like slid
down the hill face-first they thought I
was gonna come up and be like guys did
you see that but then I came up and I
was like crying so starting out with H&amp;amp;M
I just got I might have left my other
one inside oh no - here I got these
shoes they they look really nice I've
gotten so many compliments like wear
those fun and then I'm like hmm
kind of remind me of like vans but long
story short I was at where was I I was
at the mall with my
and we were like let's just go in here
and get some like cheap school sweaters
because for our school were only allowed
to wear specific color and so then we
want to look for them and my friend was
like quit you should get those or buy
the brand divided that's like in the H&amp;amp;M
section though so yeah I think they've
semi cute stuff and it's really exciting
when you find something from like H&amp;amp;M or
forever 21 or just something like kind
of cheap moving on the next fall fashion
item I got from H&amp;amp;M was this army jacket
also by divided which is in H&amp;amp;M as I
just said with my shoes and I got it in
the size too I think I don't know
because I feel like greens and like
these type of colors reminds me like a
lot like the Falls those are the only
two things from H&amp;amp;M it's so now the one
thing I got from Topshop was black
romper but then it goes in to pants if
you know what I mean right that it feels
like a really soft blanket I want to be
honest I really like it just like
hanging out with like my girlfriends and
stuff but it's not like most flattering
like it just kind of makes you look like
not unflattering where it's like do the
quick she's like the grossest like you
know I don't know I don't know where I'm
going with this the next thing I got was
just a ton of stuff from brandy melville
which honestly I'm a little disappointed
in saying if you asked me that last year
I would not buy anything from brandy
melville and I don't like when I'm
wearing something young people are like
oh my god I like that where is it from
and it's for brandy melville something
about brandy melville I don't know if
it's a ring to it something about it
just bothers me I don't know but they do
have kind of cute stuff so the first
thing I got for fall is this and it's
just honestly the coziest thing I've
ever worn in my life always want knit
sweaters like always I'm just obsessed
with them so when I saw this caramel it
was from the sweater
but yeah so when I saw this I was like
oh my gosh I need this it is so cool and
it also comes in tan which I also have
but the next thing is an airplane is
going by again I got so many of these
dresses because I think they're so cute
but apparently they're like super
classic white girl dresses but like
before I ordered these like I rarely saw
people wearing them so my super classic
white girl for getting them even I
didn't know people were getting them oh
my god I can't stop looking sorry I keep
looking my viewfinder because I can't
keep my eyes off my huge scab yeah so I
just got this dress from brandy melville
and it yeah it just looks like this it's
just a really comfortable soft but yeah
I got them in a bunch of color so I also
got it in this white one with pink
stripes get red one with white stripes I
don't want to pull unfold them all out
because you get what they look like
and then it looks like the exact other
one but it's a little different so I
just showed you this one and this is a
different one and then I got it in blue
with like white very thin stripes and
just goes down like that
and then lastly which is a bit different
from the rest of them is this black one
so it just looks like a huge long
t-shirt the next thing I got from brandy
melville is this jean jacket I think
this is gonna be super cute this fall I
definitely have ideas of how I want to
wear it so the next two things I got
were just from PacSun which I love
Pakistan they have some really really
cute stuff I'm obsessed with their Jean
I feel really really good there by
bullhead denim company and they carry a
bunch of a denim stuff on PacSun so the
jeans are really cute I have a bunch of
jean shorts that I was at one point
obsessed with from wool
I have same pair of jeans but in like a
burgundy color though they're the same
skinniest high-rise whatever they
stretch a lot so it's like if you eat
too much one day like don't worry you'll
still fit
lastly moving on to forever 21 it's got
this gray shirt dress that my sister
found for me and honestly it's coming
over my house I feel like it knows I'm
at let's go about to crash into me it's
not normally what forever21 would have
so I was super excited when she found it
and it just looks like this
it's kind of like this material and then
it goes down to like a silky material
and then at the bottom it looks like
that and then the last thing is this
skirt um looks like this no the
sprinklers are going off
