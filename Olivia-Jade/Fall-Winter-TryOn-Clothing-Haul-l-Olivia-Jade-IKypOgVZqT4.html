definitely spin also in the VIP Black
Friday sale there are a lot of pieces
that are like Lulu's highest-rated
pieces that are very very very rarely
discounted so this is just a chance to
have like your size a good discount
something you've been eyeing on Lulu's
you can now get your hands on which is
really exciting for it sells out so with
that all being said I'm gonna have all
the links down below in the description
box and now onto the clothing I can show
you so if you want to purchase any of
this or if you guys want to enter or any
of that you can see some options so this
is kind of another fall into winter haul
just a bunch of pieces that I picked
that I thought would be really great to
have in my closet kind of like staple
pieces or stuff that I feel like you
guys would really love and I want to
show you so I'm gonna start with an
accessory that I just think is so so so
cute I'll try and limit my cute count on
this video but this bag I think is so
classic and it just looks very high-end
to me I love the color red right now as
you can probably see on my body and I
just think this bag is beautiful
has a shoulder shop so you can make it a
crossbody bag and make it a little bit
more casual everyday wear or you can
like keep it super chic and hold it by
the handle this looks so high-end and I
don't think this was crazy expensive so
if you're looking for like a good pop of
color in your wardrobe I think this bag
is like the perfect size and perfect
everyday bag it's adorable
okay so I'm gonna start by getting the
accessories and shoes out of the way I
cannot wait to show you this pair of
shoes these are from Lulu's obviously
every single thing in this haul is from
Lily's first of all see how I already
kind of scuffed them up they're so easy
to clean how about my pets gross they
are just these white really chunky boots
and I think there's such a statement
piece in your wardrobe it really kind of
is like the focal point of your outfit
if you throw these on but also it gives
you height they're super comfortable
ignore that little mess behind me okay
next up are these shoes and I think
these are just really fun and different
they're like these little loafers with
this cute little tassel and they're this
like metallic dark silver color as you
can see these are just the perfect shoe
if you just have some like baggy
boyfriend jeans on and like maybe a crop
top or whatever t-shirt you have and you
can just kind of slide these on they
kind of just make them very preppy and
chic so I was a really big fan of these
when I saw them on the website so as you
guys know I love red right now and these
boots are to die for
when I first saw them I was like this
heel is really small but it's actually
really comfortable and it just kind of
works and it doesn't look weird on it
doesn't look like unproportional or
anything I think this would be awesome
tucked like if you had a leather pant
tucked into this I think that would look
amazing also with jeans sorry I'm
speaking so much about these pieces I
just want to give you guys options on
how to wear them in case you're like I
have no idea how to style that I just
think red is so in and you could even
like do like an all-black outfit and
then have like these two statement like
pieces in that red vibrant color would
be really fun all right and lastly for
shoes these amazing heels these are the
most comfortable shoes to walk in and I
love the tassel tie right there they're
so classy and I think they look so
expensive so I died when I saw these so
now I'm going to go on to the clothing
I'll start with this big chunky knit
cardigan I love over
sighs sweaters and oversize cardigans
and stuff and I really don't have that
many like cozy cardigans I said
cardigans so many times I tried to find
a new word for it but like I just don't
have one first of all I love the color
cream because it goes with everything I
think this would look awesome with a
pair of light wash jeans like a light
shirt this thrown over it just super
comfortable and cozy perfect for the
winter and like some cute sneakers or
some cute little boots or whatever it is
I don't know I just think this is really
really nice and it's so comfortable
also this sweater okay this is gonna be
a little bit harder to hold up so you'll
see in the Tryon kind of what it looks
like but I just died for the feeling of
this sweater it's the softest thing I've
ever felt I wish this was a blanket so
just kind of like crosses in the front
it's a nude color so it matches with
everything and yeah I really like it so
next is this off-the-shoulder
black top these are really in right now
I just really like the one shoulder
situation I think it's like really
flattering on your collarbone and stuff
and I think it's really easy to like
layer gorgeous jewelry with oh my god
this shirt is so cool so this shirt is
amazing because it kind of has like a
built in place in sure if that makes any
sense it's this really big oversized
white top with like you can see I'm a
Tryon I don't even know how to explain
what this is but it just kind of draws
focus to a tinier waist and I think it
just adds something to like a big
oversized white long sleeve t-shirt you
already know my obsession with chunky
sweaters so when I saw this huge
oversized gray turtleneck I was like
honestly the sweater should be called
the Olivia J because this is all I like
to wear in my life I don't know what my
obsession has been recently with dresses
that kind of look like suits but they're
not you'll see what I need this if
you've been following me since like 2014
15 ish y'all know my obsession with
stripes and it's just kind of classy
sophisticated but still really beautiful
on and you just look like a hot business
mama so why not next are these faux
leather pants there
teeny tiny tiny bit big on me so I'm
just gonna get them taken in so they're
like super tight fit leather pants so I
saw this dress and when I tried it on
the only thing I would change about it
is just I would shorten it because I
really like short dresses this is just
the most beautiful dress if you're in
high school or whatever and you have
like a dance or a homecoming or
something this is the cutest off the
shoulder I think it's so flattering to
it like really sucks you in and makes
your figure look really beautiful and
black is a really easy great comfortable
color because you know you're not like
being too crazy or anything it's kind of
like the standard like feel good feel
confident color in my book and this
dress was just amazing I wish I had this
when I went to formal with my friend
because I did not like what I wore and I
wish I had this before it's just so cute
and I think also this was like a really
sleek bun at an event with like
beautiful lashes really glowy skin a
really pretty heel it's just so cute oh
I said I was not gonna say cute this
video dang it this dress is my favorite
little going out dressed like you can
throw this on no bra required
I recently wear this out to lunch with
my sister and her friends and they don't
really like it it this belt I saw and I
was like this is so interesting so I've
seen people like belt their shirts to
give them more shape but I really am a
fan of this this looks so cute you could
put this over like a dark band tee just
like for contrast between like the navy
blue and like black if you're wearing
the good dark black shirt or something
or you could put this on like a white
shirt and just make it like more daytime
this little black t-shirt is a
turtleneck and it's very sheer and kind
of see-through so you could put like a
cool bralette under I love turtlenecks
especially this one this is like
exceptionally soft the last thing I'm
gonna show you guys is a big nice lined
jacket so its line would like this
really nice fuzzy material and it's just
a denim jacket thank you so much for
