dinner soon so I thought I would just
bring you guys along to get ready with
me so this is my outfit it's this little
top my jeans are like can't really show
you there's no full-length mirrors in
this whole entire house and then my I
was going to decide and then my mules
are rag-and-bone I can't see if I like
it though since there's no like weird I
guess see I just don't know if I like
the shirt do my makeup though and then
cry see and the bottom line is not gonna
be great but I want to show you a few
Sephora question products that money is
to get ready and just two things clear
with me okay and it's part of their new
launch and as they're doing about our
one of their beauty ambassadors I want
to show you guys what they are so let's
find a place to set you up so it's just
a little primer on use whatever you have
like one was a little bit of a blow but
totally doesn't matter I'm gonna start
with foundation that this is the Sephora
collection make no mistakes foundation
and concealer stick what's awesome is
it's a foundation and concealer so you
really can be lazy with your makeup
especially right now it's like seven
seven twenty and I had dinner at 7:45
and I mean the look little bit so one of
my roots up with any sick foundation
even though this one is super fun
without with stripping about this before
collection what it has when I went to
the like lesson I guess you could call
it I just fell behind the scenes footage
the trainer to list that has kind of
like these oils in it to make it blend
easily so you don't need to spray your
brush before or it's not gonna be stuck
on your face but I always bring my face
anyway I'm just using this little tart
spray and just kinda no I just like
doing it I got it a little easier and
then I'm just going to take a few sides
like this
okay I'm just kind of fun this whole
thing out so I just shared this out to
be a lot more natural but that if you
keep building it you can build it so
high up and it conceals also so very
easy I am just going to contour my face
I feel like with this foundation for
some reason I present me could be spent
before contour it's like it's just it's
not good but it just is so easy so I'm
just going to kind of contour my face
using benefit hoola and then I'm going
to do a little training my highlight and
benefit to this investor Watsa I love it
okay so what I'm going to do is just
curl my butt like your back - Bella next
