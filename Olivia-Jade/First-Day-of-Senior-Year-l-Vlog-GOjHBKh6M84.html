happening oh good morning
I'm gonna put a little bit of makeup on
it's good to have to take photos for my
yearbook
that's literally
I can't even believe this is happening
right now oh wait okay that was some
moisturizer concealer
I really just don't want to talk to
anyone today
okay just straight up that's it I don't
want
I'm already not in the right uniform but
I don't care but I should probably
ignore my mess yesterday I'm okay I
should probably put this blazer in my
backpack because my school makes me wear
a blazer on Monday how sweet of that
misses the look oh yeah god I love it
my room is disgustingly messy I actually
what polo on under this but just
all right my mom after school I won't
I will not whatever you get a new case
what's going on YouTube
I couldn't
classic 2018 is the best oh yeah it's so
hot in every single room I've gone to
one class and I already want to die
I just want to go
I'm home and I've never been so happy to
be anywhere in my whole entire life on a
real note though I know that I complain
about school I mean who actually enjoys
going to school if you do very jealous
but I also feel the need to say that for
all of us that like to complain about
school because I get how much of sucks
we have to remember how lucky we are to
have an education and how many people
would kill to have a good education or
an education at all so as much as I hate
it I still hate it but I'm grateful that
I get to be educated even though I hate
it you know that's about it thanks for
watching this very tiny short little
vlog of my first day of senior year
don't forget to Like comment and
subscribe this video was more of like
won't even call it a vlog a little clips
of me dreading school but love you all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
