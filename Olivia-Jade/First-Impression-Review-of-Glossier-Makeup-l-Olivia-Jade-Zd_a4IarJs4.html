fill my room still arm is bad you don't

professional videos I kind of wanted to
switch it up so let me know what you
think if you don't like it don't worry
I'm still going to have other
backgrounds on my stuff on my channel
it's not just going to be this I just
kind of wanted to play around and I love
watching beauty groups with this
background so I decided get one myself
comp Jack okay I want to go over
everything that orders first of all
really quickly like a little mini haul
so we have the glassy eyed perfecting
skin tint well.ca lip gloss we have a
cloud paint this is for your cheeks we
have the glossy a priming moisturizer we
have the glossy a balm calm Universal
skin solve what is this use on your lips
elbows cuticles on your friends dogs off
the glossier milk jelly cleanser I don't
think I'm going to try this out today
but if I end up liking it I'll let you
guys know and lastly in this bag we have
a glossy a do effect highlighter that'll
be interesting
I have a super glow the serum invisible
shield daily sunscreen and I also have a
concealer the stretch concealer oh and I
also I'm wearing this glossy a headband
because I bought it because I I'm just
really good at buying stuff I don't need
in my life but I bought anyway and I'm
wearing it because it's cute as hell
okay let's just kind of start doing
makeup I mean let's not waste any time
services glossier priming moisturizer it
says it's a buildable hydrating cream
after cleansing massaged all ups of the
cream into your face using upward
strokes up and out so apply more where
needed to prime skin for makeup and or
life I don't want to cleanse my skin
right now I washed it like a little bit
ago moisturize eye cream that whole
thing so we're going to just go for this
I'm just going to apply a little bit to
the back of my hand take a little all my
finger and just kind of rub excuse me if
I look a little oily I like three lights
on me right now and so obviously I might
be looking a little shiny but see it
smells it doesn't unlock anything but I
had to kind like a tiny bit of a weird
spoon it's a hydrating cream so I
wouldn't say that it feels like cooling
or refreshing I know it doesn't say that
but usually with my hydrating creams
like my toothpaste hangover primer is
really hydrating and my it cosmetics
creams all of that the moisturizer is
not the CC cream all of that feels
really hydrating and cooling and this
one just kind of feels like it's not
like cooling it's not hydrating but I
mean it definitely does the job I
wouldn't say my skin feels like extra
soft and so I'm not obsessed by any
means we'll see no up let's do a little
bit of this balm calm lip balm okay
that's really nice that makes your lips
feel really smooth this is one of the
products works like very deep hydration
let's start with the skin tint I got
mine in the shade medium I don't know if
this is going to be my shade so we're
just going to see it's a shape before
you so let's do that give it a fair shot
I don't know if I want to apply it with
a brush or a Beauty Blender I feel like
with skin tones I kind of like using my
hands and then maybe a blender like a
Beauty Blender but we'll see oh it's
really sheer okay this is roses oh it's
perfect my shades
so this isn't really supposed to be full
coverage in the slightest I think a skin
10 is most adjustable to even up the
skin tone so let's just see what does
that I'm not going to base it off of
full coverage because I know it's not
and it feels like a moisturizer let's
see actually maybe if we blended out
with a sponge will it get a little bit
more coverage this is very radiant and
super glowy and radiant very like very
everyday like if you're not allowed to
wear makeup to school every day just is
how little it looks on the track kind a
little bit more on my Beauty Blender and
just building up the coverage infuse
around the nose okay so for this it
automatically makes your skin look
really alive illuminated hydrated all
that good stuff that you want it gives a
really healthy glow but it does not
provide any coverage literally I don't
even have I just have a red spot right
here from getting my eyebrows done
tonight as long as it's not risen in
nothing and it kind of just doesn't
really cover it so I wouldn't say it
provides any coverage I still see all my
freckles but I'm totally obsessed with
it you guys know I like natural finishes
and it honestly just completely evens
out the skin tone but it doesn't provide
any coverage so if you're someone that
likes the full coverage look definitely
would recommend if you're the girl that
kind of likes the Laura Mercier tinted
moisturizer and just kind of the lighter
looks I definitely would recommend this
she looks amazing it doesn't even feel
like I'm wearing anything and I think it
even got my skin really nicely I just no
coverage okay let's try the concealer
I'm hoping that the concealer has
coverage because I who buys concealer
and hope it doesn't have coverage we're
just going to use the finger to warm it
up and I'm just going to apply it
directly under my eye gorgeous but sheer
just like I think glossier is really
about the natural look like no makeup
makeup and that's exactly what this does
let's try and cover this red spot and
see
covers it I love how blendable it is oh
this is so creamy
especially for concealers like this I
never really use these because they're
kind of harsh like hard to blend out and
this is doing a really easy job but it's
not really covering redness or anything
in my opinion you guys the thing with
this is it's not dry I really can't tell
that it smells good I'm going to be
taking my Laura Mercier powder to set it
just because I know this powder I love
this powder and I want to see how the
concealer and foundation work or the
skin tip works also very exciting I
might have found a juice for this powder
I'm still playing around so I don't want
to speak too soon but I might have found
something very similar half of X we're
keeping it natural
I'm just because I'm in Lex right now I
don't want to be like an oily ball so
let's just set under the eyes
what crease is really quick really quick
we're going to try this little glossy a
cloud pink seamless cheek color I love a
good cream cheek I die for a good clean
cheek actually I'm going to do this on
the back of my hand because these things
are unpredictable like I love to squirt
it out of there I'm going to go like
this oh it's super sheer which I love
and I'm going to start with just one
side and blend with the Beauty Blender
okay really here but I love this product
I think oh yeah it's there let's see the
size of the finger and see very similar
I actually you get a little bit more
coverage with the finger and then let's
just blend it up with the blender my
face or some reason is really red
throughout here right now anyway so I
probably wouldn't put blush on right now
if I was being a little bit normal and I
don't know why so red
I think it's just cuz I comb my eyebrows
done I'm in front of the light so my
eyebrows are a little bit red and a
little bit hot because I'm approximately
bright light so it's probably why but
really good definitely would recommend
this the skin tint and the concealer is
kind of more personal preference I feel
like that this is a really pretty cream
blush I'm going to try is a highlight
now this is the Hollis scope and do
effect highlighter and I got it in the
shade court Wow interesting if you can
see in the middle right there with that
clear circle it's kind of like a gel
consistency so I think that's going to
help blend the product just going to
apply this to the top image the gel
sheers it out so it looks like a part of
your skin it feels tiny bit stickier
like more tacky than your average cream
highlighter but I think it's really
pretty
again it's subtle it's not binding and
it's not and the thing with it is it's
not shimmering like benefit walked up or
some of the other cream highlighters I
use it's kind of like it's like glowing
from within looks but it's a little bit
shimmery and sparkly so it obviously
looks a little bit fake this one really
looks like it could be your skin because
it's not really a shimmer it's almost
like your skin created this from maybe
sweat oh I got their brow grooming
pomade I usually hate kids brow gels I
think they make a mess and they don't do
anything solji oh see up so I don't like
these some rubs off you leave it still
just annoying like it's nice if you like
to de browser learning this is actually
really good one so it actually fills
them in I've never had a tinted brow gel
that actually fills my brows in and that
is noticeably darker as you can tell I
actually wait I take back what I said
it's actually really nice wow it is a
little messy but all brow gels butter
colors are but I actually am very
pleasantly surprised if you like this
look I definitely think it's a brow gel
that you already have to have brows for
it's not going to create hair but it
definitely just fills in the sparse
areas I'm going to finish off with the
lip gloss we're going to try it out I
know I got other stuff and which I
talk about in other videos soon but I
can't really test it out as a makeup
I've heard a lot about this lip gloss
it's not pumping or anything it's just
like a transparent clear shade but
apparently it is so glassy I mean their
name is glossy a so I'm hoping they can
make a glossy lip gloss let's give it a
go oh shut up is my favorite product you
guys this is the best thing ever it
makes your lips look bigger and it feels
really good and it's not tingling and it
just looks really pretty like really
pretty so let's do a little recap of
what I would recommend what I wouldn't
recommend let's start with the first
thing I used which was the primer this
is a glossy a climbing moisturizer do I
think this is worth the money I don't I
think you're looking for a hydrating
primer I would go with Too Faced and
hangover primer or not strobe cream or
something that gives manasa tea but also
hydrating this kind of feels a little
gel like not as watery and I kind of
like the water feelings primary if I'm
trying to hydrate so no I would have
recommend this for hydrating sorry
glossy a multi a balm calm this is the
first lip thing I applied what I
recommended yes it is very hydrating if
you have really dry lips I think this
would actually cure them it feels really
good on the skin kit I would recommend
this for myself personally because I
like very very very natural coverage so
now how about it's almost nothing and
just evens out your skin tone so if
you're like that if you want your
freckles showing through if you don't
have acne that you're trying to conceal
then yes I would recommend this this is
like this is pretty it's very comparable
at the laura mercier in my opinion where
I recommend this to someone who likes
the full coverage look that has acne
that they want to conceal no definitely
not concealer
let's talk about this I liked it it was
natural it was lightweight but I would
not recommend it I wouldn't recommend it
for myself because I don't think it did
a great job covering consumers lips to
cover up redness and this just didn't do
it for me sorry the cloud paint what I
recommend this
solutely whenever I find Pink's like
pink kind of blushes they're really hard
to blend out they're really thick which
makes it really challenging to blend out
and make it look natural and this one is
just so lightweight it's really creamy
but it comes in this little paint
consistency and it's wonderful and it
just adds like a really nice light color
so when I recommend this definitely
we've got this highlight and what I
recommend miss glossing a highlight I
really do like it I think it's pretty
but I do also like a little bit of a
stronger glow this kind of looks like
sweat on my face it is pretty but it's
not something that I would maybe off for
every single day and lastly let's talk
about this lip gloss what I recommend it
110 percent this is the prettiest lip
gloss at our salafi it feels good and it
just makes your lips look really plumped
and like juicy so definitely would
recommend this okay guys so I think
that's all I have time for today to show
