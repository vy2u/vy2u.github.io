back to another video in today's video
as you can tell by the title I am doing
like one of my most requested videos not
a skincare routine just because I
haven't tried a lot of these products
yet but it is kind of like an updated
new skincare haul if you guys want me to
do it updated skincare routine I think
you probably do because I kind of get a
lot of requests on that it is coming
soon today I'm just going to haul a few
things a few things I literally spent
all my life savings on fresh Beauty if
you guys do want to see what I bought
from fresh then just keep watching I
just wanted to get very clear that I
bought this all of my own money
fresh did not send me any of this I
haven't even tried half of it yet but I
put on snapchat and Instagram and a lot
of people said they wanted to see a haul
so here I am filming a haul so I'm going
to start with this I have not tried this
yet as you can see it's still in this
box this is the French rose cleansing
foam so this is infused of soothing rose
water and it says it hydrates and
balances your skin it also says that it
is a mousse almost sounds funny ah yeah
that's definitely a mousse they're all
the same scent and it all smells like
cucumbers I'm not angry about it but
like every since I was like a cucumber
the next thing I got I have used this
and I actually went through it very fast
this is my favorite thing in the world
so every purchased it this is the fresh
the original brown sugar body polish
this is basically just a huge body scrub
my issue with this is you just use it so
fast it goes by so fast because it's not
good and I just want to use that much it
smells amazing it makes your legs and
your arms or whatever you're exfoliating
so soft like your body will feel like a
baby's but it is able to freaks me out
it will just your body will be really
soft okay that's what I was trying to
say next I have this fresh sugar
nourishing lip balm I don't know why I
bought this this could totally have been
wasting money because I have so many lip
balms I like
I'm chillin with it's honestly the
aesthetic that dragged me do you like is
that not just the cutest thing you've
ever seen
feel soft soft to touch but we'll see
how it works I love how all the precious
products are super super natural oh it
does smell good yeah oh is that an
animal pardon this next product is the
most ecstatic ly pleasing thing I've
ever looked at this is the fresh deep
hydration facial toner it has rose
petals in it so it just makes it so
beautiful it smells kind of like Mario
Badescu rose bar if you have that
obviously roses so it's just going to
smell like the typical rose scent but I
love toners it balances your skin it
also shows like excess makeup right
before moisturizer I going with the
toner to c5 any other like foundations
or concealers or excess makeup on my
face and it kind of like just the final
removing touches so I love a good toner
and this one's just gorgeous next I have
this fresh soy face cleanser it's just a
little cleanser actually I looked up
like a coupon code online when I was
purchasing that word just to see and
there was some code where with my order
I can get this for free so I just
obviously I got it this smells like
cucumbers that's all I can really
explain it as I also have this fresh
rose hydrating eye gel cream I love a
good eye cream I just wanted to test it
out I haven't tried this yet so I will
let you guys know we're just going to
try it out oh it's really all baby oh
maybe I just found my arm when arm feels
like the softest thing I've ever felt in
my life in no exaggeration I've been
using this and I love it this is the
fresh sugar face polish I don't use it
every night it is a pretty like intense
exfoliant it's very much similar to the
body scrub looks like this as you can
see my fingers up in like using it I
brought this to VidCon with me it's just
really good after you use like micellar
water or makeup wipes or whatever to
like cleanse your skin and get all the
dirt and makeup off of it it's just like
sandy or salty or whatever you want to
call it as you can see now my hand feels
fancy
Mack I bought this sugar lip polish as
you can tell I really wanted to polish
my face and really just scrub it down so
I had a new skin with my body college my
face polish and my lip polish kind of
like a Biddy sandy consistency you rub
it all over your lips and then you've
got such smooth lips to kiss all the
boys and girls in the world just kidding
actually that's we get mouth herpes okay
next brush alone is sorry I think I'm
funny and I'm like not funny edna's
press Lotus youth preserve face cream so
fresh is known for like their
moisturizers I haven't tried this one
yet I love how all of the fresh
moisturizers like the eye cream this
moisturizer ones that I've tried in the
past or really lightweight but they feel
very hydrating so if you have dry skin i
would recommend fresh for moisturizers
they're a little bit pricey but they
just feel really nice and it just kind
of makes me feel like luxurious and like
my skin is really getting deep hydration
which obviously if you're buying washes
you probably need next I got this fresh
skin scooter after shave okay so
sometimes when I shave my leg I get
really bad razor burn and this happened
to me like yesterday and I don't know
why so this hasn't commes balances and
hydrates I will let you guys know I
haven't tried this yet I forgot about
this family this is supposed to just
soothes like razor bumps or whatever so
I need that on my legs because when I
had like chicken talks well not
literally chicken pox don't worry don't
be scared of me what am I saying right
now Olivia sound like I'm on drugs and I
do drugs so that's fun this is so fresh
very nourishing hand cream so I was on
interview with someone who was it oh it
wasn't an interview I was watching to
learn Elizabeth's videos she mentioned
something about how you can never forget
your hands and your neck because those
will wrinkle cuz we take care of our
face but I never do anything with my
neck or my hands so I bought a hand
cream Lauren this could have been the
biggest waste of money or like not but I
think it was Lauren's video I'm pretty
sure was not I bought hand cream so
hopefully when I'm old I don't have
lay hands I also bought another toner I
don't know why this is a waste of money
someone take away my credit card but
this is the fresh growth floral toner
infused with soothing rosewater and it
hydrates and refreshes it comes with
ajust a twisty cap but I put the spray
cap on when it came on honestly same
exact thing as Mario Badescu rose water
than me so I don't really care but I
don't know I bought it because I like to
waste my money apparently you have Marta
but fu I think it's a lot cheaper and I
don't know this one just looks prettier
but just brushes aesthetic gets me I'm
that girl that buy for aesthetically
pleasing items so I can look up I also
got this
Seabury skin nutrition cleansing oil I
really wanted an oil to break down my
makeup I was using a Neutrogena one but
I don't know I was I liked it I just
wanted to try something new so I love
how this looks it says it's going to
break down my makeup remove it I'm very
excited to try that out because I do
want to try in oil
I'm obsessed like my ride-or-die is my
Clinique cleansing balm it's like an oil
balm and it's like how I remove all my
makeup so I'm excited to try like
another oil product next I have this
fresh rose deep hydration base Yoram
next I think that's the last thing yeah
this is the last thing I have with
Angelica leaf extract it retains
moisture so I actually do have dry skin
in the winter time summer time why did I
buy this as a combination skin like some
parts are really dry for me like my
forehead and my nose gets really dry but
unlike my forehead and my nose not all
so oily sometimes I don't know guys
Edward skin does not make any sense to
the serum I've always wanted to use a
serum because I feel like that's just
bring that extra mile for your skin and
I mean who doesn't want to go the extra
mile
well except me if it's running I
definitely know when I'm in a turmoil
but if it's Beauty hell yeah I just
wanted to try out a serum so I'm very
excited I will keep you guys updated on
all of these products because I know
