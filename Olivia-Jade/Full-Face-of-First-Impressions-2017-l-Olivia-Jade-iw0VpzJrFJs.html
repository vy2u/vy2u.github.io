I'm doing a full face of first

kind of a really light space and like a
little pink lip I hope you guys enjoy it

enter I'm pretty self-explanatory but if
you actually want to do with the prizes
or I'll list the videos you can see it I
hope you guys love this look
let's get started and let's find out
what I love and what I don't like for
first impression makeup products
moisturizer that's the first thing I'm
going to test out I recently got three
glam glow moisturizers ones in a Sun
blow one is in nude glow and one is in
pearl glow I have no idea how any of
these are going to work I think I'm
gonna go with the one that says news
glow since I have like medium to tan
skin right now and I think it will just
match me that packaging same as usual
whoo okay it's like a pink oh my god you
know what about it instantly just like
highlight your skin if I reminds me of
like Mac strobe cream you know when you
put on it to kind of like makes your
skin glow okay I actually love that I'm
going to try a matte foundation and they
did send me their new collection of
foundation it's called the next to
nothing face color fluid illuminator so
it's a shape well before you use I don't
know what shade I'm going to be in oh
that was kind of orange e a little
anyone who
I think these two shades mixed together
and don't know which ones those are and
then medium dark and light plus yeah
that looks about right so I know Mac is
known for kind of having thicker
foundations that's why I'm kind of
curious because I've actually never used
the Mac foundation in my life which is
so weird I'm just going to buff it out
with a real techniques brush i'm not
using first impression of brushes just
we don't have new brushes so I'm going
to do my max fulfill of a shave
I kind of feel like the thing with that
is it's not bad but it's just kind of
like your normal foundation it's
lightweight but if there's a lot of
brands are making all their foundations
lightweight even though it does give a
nice amount of coverage it's like a
medium to sheer but I think you could
definitely build it up yeah it feels
really lightweight I definitely don't
have a problem I think it looks really
pretty on the skin I think I'll stay
away from the drugstore that's really
comparable I'm going to go wipe this off
my hand so next I'm going to go in with
concealer I'm really excited to try this
out this is a co Gendo moisture fit
concealer I have a mission 0 2 and 0 3
I'm relieved 0su
going to use a beauty blender tool in
this out
all right this concealer either stop or
my medium under spamming
ah mix your skin look really patchy and
it's thick like both thick okay I'm
going to try this powder it's called
amazing cosmetics and this is a little
translucent powder please be good it
really mad 5 so that's a bonus
whew let's go take this on huge fatter
brush and kind of set the rest of my
face I like that however that's the
amazing cosmetics and the development
mineral powder set makes your skin feel
really soft I've been dying to try this
out this is the color pop like a duo I
don't really know I like touched it
before so I know kind of feel this and
I've never put on my skin and it doesn't
tell you which one this is which is
weird come with a big fluffy brush just
to first warm up the cheeks I really
like the formula might be a little
orange e but the way it actually applies
is pretty so I've got that bronzer on
I've been really dying to try these away
luminizing liquid highlighters I'm going
to use the shade number one new light
I'm really excited
so you just kind of twist it up I'm
reading
okay I really like that it's really
subtle and really glowy I'm going to
take about same color palette and just
going with that powder highlight I'm
just some kind of like any random brush
I've got whoo I love this highlight oh
my god color pop I'm through I kind of
feel like my face for some reason is it
getting dark right there I'm just going
to try and use this amazing cosmetic
powder and you know just clean it up
okay for brows I'm going to tie this
makeup forever little brow I don't
know what this is exactly just going to
take a shape it come with a little brush
which is nice just going to fill the
world in okay so things this is like
it's in by no means bad it all like make
for a really good brand they make really
good product this just wouldn't be my
thing because it just takes a little bit
longer this is the artistic brows is
kind of easy to just use a brow pencil
for in goes on I wanted to try this Marc
Jacobs blush this is the final fourth
cake and kisses air blush I love it
I really feel like Marc Jacobs just and
stepping up their game but that's such a
pretty color it went on so easily it
felt too much not too little love it and
want to try this milk makeup eye pigment
this one is in the shade after party
means a little my finger
OOP oh okay oh my god
that's insane
really did not expect that at all
I'm then is going to go in with the
covergirl to make it roses palette as
colored so pink and pretty keys I'm
going to go in with this pink here and
this purple right like cached away and
just use those out our transition shades
this is going to match really well so
wow this is so pretty
I really like the covergirl palette so
pigmented and so inexpensive I'm then
going to go in with a little pencil
brush and take the very last shade on
the edge which is a really deep purple
well with this one with black that's how
dark it is and I'm just going to deepen
the outer corner a trick to doing a
really easy smoky eye is applying that
darkest outer corner to your inner
corner but you just want to be very
careful and do it so you don't look like
you got punched so we're really precise
brush just a tiny tiny bit does the
trick so I'm going to show you this is
applied tiny bit just like that
take the other side and we're just going
to take the same brush that blending
brush I'm not picking up any more
product and I'm just going to blend that
out this covergirl is a cover we up this
covergirl palette is insane
so good fabula recommend I just want to
make this better pop a little bit so I'm
just taking a tiny little brush and I'm
going to take that gold a shade and that
shimmery kind of white shade deep to
right here and I'm just going to pop
this right on the center of the eye
there so pigmented whoa it has a little
bit fallout but that is really pretty oh
my god covergirl
what are you doing to me you're giving
me life I'm going to start by taking a
really tiny brush like can you even see
that tiny and I'm going to take that
darkest shade and just blend it as close
my chin to the lower lash line
and then it just going to take a little
smudge brush and take those two cliches
but light purple kind of that lilac and
that violet and just kind of smoke out
my lower lashline just connect it up top
kind of I might not even carrying like
I'm really smoking this out I'm Sam it
just going to go in with another little
pencil brush and taking that these two
first shades and just popping that on
the inner corner I'm going to try to do
what kit lash Couture faux mink in that
name I'm going to botch it so I'm just
going to show you it and I'm also going
to try the kiss lash glue that can fit
the band looks a little thick so that
freaks me out
I like lashes that hardly have a band my
trick to put lashes on you always wait
30 to 40 seconds until the glue gets
tacky I know you can tell you where you
suspend
these lashes are pretty I will say they
look really pretty but they feel a
little sick so I've barely got this
class to say I just really I think
they're pretty I think they would be
really pretty if they didn't have a huge
band that really prevents it from them
sticking definitely don't like the glue
but this partly back to a latch is
stunning I'd strongly like like a
mechanics behind it I'm gonna try out
this mascara to see 100% phylacteries
pigmented ultra lengthening mascara so
it was there SEC has a purple color that
works perfectly with this look I'm going
to smells incredible I am going to
finish off with the lips I'm going to
try this Maybelline a purely nude matte
lip out with misshaped eerily nude 5 3 5
looks like over the big news you would
take that off
5 4 5
and then not really it's a little too
pink I'm going to try putting over a
little bit of this bareMinerals infamous
you natheless I'm laughing just going to
finish off the makeup with this Co party
coconut Rose toner I'm really curious
how this is going to feel on my skin
I really like this spray like gives a
nice amount so I really love that bare
minerals lip thing it looks really nice
overall I'm on how they make it turned
out I think it looks really pretty but I
would have liked about our base to start
actually like that everything with
makeup just religious foundation
concealer bronzer all of that and also
these lashes and the lash glue kind of
upset me because the band was so thick I
kind of got frustrated putting it on but
I really do love other kissed lashes I
just
this band is a little thick thank you so
much for watching this video I hope it
was fun I was different
hope this makeup look is a little bit
different I did try and go for a
horrible pink kind of like sultry look
so I hope you guys at least know that
I'm trying to switch things up thank you
so much for watching I love you and I'll
see you next time bye mmm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
