to my youtube channel in today's video I
am doing a full face of recent brush no
whoa no no I'm not I'm just straight-up
not doing that I'm a full face of milks
makeup and I'm doing my first impression
of milk makeup but yeah I'm really
excited about it
hidden I love literally everything
you've ever going to die when you see
how all this works I'm going to like
everything down below for you guys and
hope you guys enjoy this video I'm just
like so contend right now yeah you guys
want to see how much I love enough
makeup and how damn natural it is then
just keep watching and I hope you enjoy
let's try this cooling water I am dying
to try this this is going to kind of be
our primer I suppose here we go we're
going to is hoping it's going to
actually be cooling oh my god oh my god
yes please get on my skin switch it up
instantly like obsessed like I don't
have to think twice
that's the Terrell products I love the
pry marks but hydrating it feels like
cold and refreshing and oh my god I mean
obviously I don't know what more I can
ask for in a primer you actually oh my
god
no wonder this is called cooling water
it's hydrating and it generally cools
down the face how makes this cold
alright so now let's move on to
foundation
I hope my dentist wouldn't listen
another yl my dentist never left me -
can you just pump it up assuming below
I'm gonna seem so cool with you hmm
smells like Kyle I can't you mean
they're something we are just going to
have to poo I like this this is like the
perfect everyday thing in my opinion I
like this a lot because it's not like it
covers a little still but not like
actually no it didn't cover at all
just I guess this is more to even out
the skin we're going to hope our
concealer covers up my pimples today
Lanza okay that's way too much blood
when you get carried away because you
don't know how much to you so it blends
out so flawlessly I'm actually shook
definitely wouldn't say it has coverage
obviously as its content freckles are
shining through my sister you can still
kind of see the color to them but this
is like the easiest thing to apply it is
so pretty and like you just look like
you're glowing supports are luminous I
was taking off makeup from a different
video and my students are looking kind
of dry and I was like maybe makeups just
not going to go on my skin well today
and now I'm just like I have to look
computers I'm going to go in with this
makeup swept concealers first the one
thing about glossier which I remembered
was that the concealers did not conceal
anything to skin it with stop signs oh
yeah from wealthy either concealer just
did not conceal enough for me and that
was my issue so I like look like skunks
his hair artist
so we are going to go ahead and try out
this conceal it oh it's a no expect up
please have coverage okay it's already a
lot thicker than coffee I hope this one
as well
oh my god this makeup is awesome I had
no idea milk was this good
I'm so publicly surprised right now it's
crazy
the cops put this concealer to the cat
whoa that's kind of cool it's like see
this can cover this is a different
computer so how I like to cover my
blemishes as I put this concealer right
it and I blend a round visit I don't
really blend out rip slick if you blend
around them is this going to stay
covered on the top under L C just like
that tap blending around it really
impressed so far and by the way
everything looks so natural like it
looks like my own skin so far I love
everything and sometimes if you like
those reviews RBS problem I genuinely
love everything and I'm not trying to
like kick off to milk let's go for a
cream contour shall we love a good cream
bronzer I'm just going to take this and
go for it
very wet so I feel like it's going to
blend really well I use your like
blending cream bronzer out with a brush
so that's what I'm going to do Oh
so blendable I would actually normally
spray my cream bronzer a contour
whatever I'm using with my brush with a
little bit of a mist to blend it out and
I didn't even need to do this big fan of
this browser wow I'm like so surprised
right now my other face like my skin
just looks so pretty and like natural
and that's really my favorite look so
I'm very excited I'm going to take a
cream blush I love a good cream blush
and as I feeling when I like this as
I've loved every now this is in the
shade perk just like this little
strawberry kind of pinkish red to apply
it directly to the apples of my cheek
and blend with my finger oh my god she's
just so cute
my concealer is starting to like crackle
under my eyes I definitely need to set
it with some powder so really quick I'm
going to set the concealer with a tiny
bit of my Laura Mercier translucent
powder another to not milk but milk
doesn't have a powder at the 71 and I
really like this look and I want to say
looking cute so we're going to do this
that this is what the creamiest which
ever it really just blends up so easily
I love focusing that on the apples of my
cheeks I think it gives a really pretty
like wash of color while still looking
super natural so we're going to go in
with a highlight this is a cream
highlighter in the shade lip I'm
probably most excited about this because
you guys know I love highlighting so I'm
not even playing you like all this stuff
is actually really good wow this might
be one of my new favorite make prints
another one milk first pea mountains
before I was so if you about I was like
I don't know like I don't really even
care to try it
until so many people asked for our first
impressions video and I'm so glad you
guys did you have no idea like just my
cheeks alone looks stunning is that
narcissistic to say I just think they
look so nice I really want to try this
little brow pencil I have so we are
going to do that have a little fluey so
we're going to brush up the brow boom
i'm creamy like more freeman's on your
leg Acula say do something when i make
all this stuff a little bit more jelly
or something cuz it's also blendable oh
my god this is what the fastest day ever
come darken like full they got so quick
to think I'm done
melt makeup do yourself a round of
applause honestly oh I am so excited
about that this is makeup face cloth I
have been so into glossy lids lately
like I don't have anything to put on for
glossy lips because I don't want to put
a clear lip gloss on cuz I could have
been sticky so this product is made for
that so we're going to do some glossy
lids and then we're going to test out
the mascara and that's everything and
I'm just going to oh really it's cool
dudes have another proper way to do
coffee lids this is cool so I don't feel
like anything's on my eyes and I doesn't
feel sticky which is really cool well
here's what I believe is it does you can
also like bring it above the lid are you
I think that was kind of cute all right
it's how violet it's a face cloth so you
can put it anywhere you could use this
even as a highlighter if you don't want
to shimmer as well
that's really pretty lastly from elf
makeup I'm going to try out their
mascara so well looks a shake of that
thing it's pretty cool you ever seen
this how about use this Mike but it's
like the natural lash everything is just
so natural should I try putting on my
lower lash line I feel like I have to oh
I like that
with just one of these little ball
things I can just go like this kind of
easy actually I just look actually
you're giving me life right now I really
just I'm going to finish it off by
putting a little bit of the blush on
their lips for a little bit more color
let me go up it suits you and I'm going
to put a little bit of the cream bronzer
underneath
right here this just make sure you let's
look a little bit powder and what we
could tell lastly for the lips I'm just
going to take a little bit of a
highlighter and under here and just kind
of keep it though
look if everything it is the most
natural glowy like yes honey
yes yes I really like it really happy
about I'm really really surprised so I'm
going to like all the products down
below I just wanna say this video is not
sponsored nothing was done to me about
all the money literally just because I
know my last day when people didn't know
if it was sponsored but I'm very I will
always be like in a video systems and
collaboration if it's sponsored so I
will always give you a heads up so I
will fit up nothing and it's also my
description box always if you're ever
confused because I definitely don't
return it hi is that for you um but yeah
so motherly surprise big thumbs up -
milk makeup honestly one of the best
brands I've tried so far for a natural
look if you like full coverage and full
heavy and all that cake goth girl or guy
you are probably not going to like this
but if you like the natural look like me
you're kind of everyday wear pretty like
effortless kind of look you are going to
be obsessed and I seriously think you
should either start saving your money
for a process or two or if you can go
out to your Sephora or online and or and
I will link it all down below I hope you
guys love this and I will see you my
next video
and
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
