welcome back to my youtube channel
and today's video I am doing another get
lit with me you know now I'm in a car I
want to address I'm not driving I'm
pulled over on the side not on the
sidewalk but you know like up against
the sidewalk
I am literally just sitting in my car
jamming out in a neighborhood with no
moving of my vehicle so I don't want
anyone to be like no walking and driving
because I'm not vlogging well I'm
vlogging but I'm not driving so I am
doing carpool karaoke or my lit songs
plays whatever I just have a bunch of
random songs in a little playlist and
some of them are throwback some of them
are current you're gonna find out but if
you're new here don't forget to hit that
subscribe button I post every single
Tuesday and Friday unless I miss a day
which is sometimes often but I always
make up for it like the next day so you
can always normally expect videos on
Tuesdays and Fridays and with that all
being said let's get into this video and
kill holy
life
at a time so much
here's what I'll do
take a seat right over there down the
stairs stay
Oh
they often write off from the Kristin
and Kristin BR and they'll make em like
this anymore
it's my biggest I spend my time just
thinking thinking thinking about you
being you
humberto just think of it if they can
come to every single bit to some a
anderson machine and all those things do
okay
that is it for my little Jam slash music
playlist carpool karaoke whatever you
want to call it thank you so much for
watching I hope that I didn't bore you
you know the first time I've filmed this
video I was so freaked out let me turn
the air off I was so scared if what
people gonna think of me because it's
weird to sing in a car it's not weird to
sing in the car by yourself but it's
weird to film yourself singing in the
car by yourself
or anywhere just filming yourself
jamming out alone just as a weird kind
of concept so I was really nervous to
post this the first time but then
everyone was like you know what Yolo and
if I said anything to anyone this whole
entire year so far to all my friends I'm
like it's the year of Yolo so if you
ever feel like you're nervous pible
people are gonna think about you or say
about you I mean who the hell cares like
at the end of the day it doesn't really
matter it's cool to be weird I guess I
don't know you know I'm just trying to
live my life to the fullest and I feel
like a lot of you always ask me like I
want to start a channel I'm afraid what
people gonna think bla bla bla
yeah so I hope you guys enjoyed this
playlist and my little speech at the end
I love you guys very much thanks for
watching this video and I'll see my next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
