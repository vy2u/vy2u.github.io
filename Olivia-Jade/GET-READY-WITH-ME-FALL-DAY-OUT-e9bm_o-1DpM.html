fall get ready with me so make sure you
subscribe doing my hair make up an
outfit
let's do this I'm starting out with
pyoderma which is basically a micellar
water I just use the Garnier one
religiously but then someone told me in
the comments a couple people told me it
causes cancer or something crazy so I
switched I'm using this Mario Badescu
rose water spray I think this is
incredible it just makes your skin feel
so refreshed and awake and it smells
amazing so I am then using my honest
Asya Brown Wiz I love this I love love
love this product just because it even
thought your brows so easily especially
if you do already have thick brows it
doesn't do too much so I think it's
really really good just for like a quick
oh my go
kind of thing but I'm just filling out
my sparse spots as you guys can tell
it's pretty self-explanatory
after I finished filling out my brows
I'm using the auto Stasi F clear brow
gel and I'm setting my brows in place
with this this is literal glue so they
will not be moving and then I'm going
back onto my skin and using a Chanel
moisturizer with the Sigma duo fiber
brush and blending this into my face as
you guys are going to tell are going to
see I used so many skin care products
before I actually go in with a
foundation or BB cream or tinted
moisturizer or whatever it is I always
use so many of their products so it's
kind of like a barrier so it's not
seeping into my skin the foundation all
the stuff that causes acne so then I'm
using another primer water or another
kind of spray and it's priming my skin
so I used in Mario Badescu I'm going to
use a moisturizer and I prime my skin
and then I finally go in with foundation
I'm using my favorite Too Faced Born
This Way Foundation in the shade nude I
love this stuff so so much and I'm just
doing my normal drill of blending this
in with a dear Beauty Blender
I also use a really light amount of
foundation just because I don't want to
feel caked on throughout the day this is
just a full day out so I really want to
make sure my skin is breathing and it's
not gonna feel too much throughout the
day I'm then going in with a concealer
and I'm just kind of placing this in a
triangle a backwards triangle I guess
and I'm not filling the inside of the
triangle because I want it to be lighter
I don't want to take up or crease
throughout the day so then I'm just
taking the same good old piggy blender
and blending this out and I think it
just looks really natural and it just
kind of makes you feel a little bit more
awake and then my favorite product
effort I'm not going to make with it or
do anything crazy or heavy I'm just
taking a fluffy tapered brush and it's
like kind of swirling that in the powder
and then just kind of setting my whole
face and I'm not focusing it too much
anywhere I do press it under my eyes and
make sure that I am really setting my
under eyes so they don't crease but I am
just kind of spreading this throughout
my whole entire face because you don't
want to feel oily throughout the day or
to show like just kind of slowly like
what's the word slide off your face that
sounds gross
umm I'm then using this Kat Von D and H
app it just kicked something shade and
light palette and then I'm contouring
with that warming up my cheekbones just
making you know make it till you make it
give yourself cheekbones it's okay I'm
just warming up my face with a little
bronzer and then I also went in with
blush from Jacqueline Hills like
champagne pop Prosecco pop palette and I
hate blush on me so immediately
regretted that I think the colors are
still beautiful but I can't wear blush
it just looks like I look like a clown
it's just not a good look so I really
tried to blend that out and then I am
using this Tarte little stick
highlighter and this does not blend out
with a Beauty Blender I learned so you
actually have to use the warmth of your
finger and it blends out really really
beautifully and gives you a really nice
subtle glow it's not something you to
for overpowering so it's really perfect
for everyday wear but you all know that
I love a good highlight and if you think
I could just get away with a little glow
from this Tarte stick you guys are crazy
I have to spray my face and then go back
in with intense highlight and use the
Becca
Jacqueline Hill palette and use a little
fan brush and make
glow what's a good expression glow to
the gods yes I am going to just place
that everywhere I want to glow and then
smooth straight out to my eyes and I'm
priming them with concealer and I also
set them with powder I just didn't leave
that parting because it's boring
I'm using a light brown shade from this
honest Razia palette I'm Mario and I'm
using a big fluffy crease brush to blend
that in to my crease and then after I do
that I kind of felt that I wanted a
little bit more more something more
orange something more fall so I took an
orange shade and started blending that
into my crease and I hope that just
completely changed the look made it look
so much more fall appropriate and just
more fun and I love how warm tones
complement brown eyes I know I'm never
experimenting those cool times on my
channel and just because I don't like
cool tones on my eyes I really don't so
I'm using these two shimmer shades I
think it's called Fifth Avenue and Marie
move or something I will have it linked
down below but I'm just blending that in
two of my no on my eye and then I went
with a really dark brown just cuz I
wanted to be even richer and more
fall-like and it as you could just see a
little bit before it was a little
intense but if you blend it out look how
beautiful and then I'm taking the first
two shades I put my crease which were
that orange and wraparound and blending
it on my lower lash line then I'm going
to curl my lashes finish off the eyes
with some mascara and I'm using my
better than sex mascara by Too Faced and
I'm actually only going to be applying
this to my top lashes I often find when
I apply mascara to my bottom lashes it
transfers on to my under eyes throughout
the day so not down with that I'm using
a Chanel lip gloss to finish off the
makeup and that is what it looks like I
think it is so glowy and beautiful so I
was really happy with how it turned out
and I hope you guys like it and here's a
really up close and personal shot
because I thought it was funny I'm then
moving on to my hair did I address I was
blonde I dyed my hair I don't remember
if I said that but since our daddy
yesterday it still had some natural curl
from non natural pearl curl that the
salon put in yesterday they curled my
hair I'm not speaking English but I'm
using this kind of beachy wave salt
spray or whatever it's called
- just texturize my hair and make it
look a little peach year
enhance my curls I guess but I didn't do
much and then on to the outfit I love
this outfit for fall I'm wearing this
Friday Melville sweater
Brady Melville backpack Zara boots and
frame jeans and the sweater the backpack
and the boots were all in my fall
clothing haul which was last week's
video so I will link that down below if
you haven't seen it there are some
really great pieces in there that are
pretty good priced so I love this outfit
I think the jeans how to get your body
really really nicely and they make your
butt look super cute the boots are not
crazy expensive and they look like such
great quality the sweater is so cozy and
warm in the backpack it's just cute but
casual and it is kind of like works with
the look kind of it gives schoolgirl
vibes so thank you so so much for
watching I love you guys and I would
catch you in my next one
