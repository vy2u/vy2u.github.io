today I'm doing a get ready with me for
Father's Day as you can tell by the
title also as you probably are wondering
why is this posted on Monday olivia's
posting schedule is Sunday and it's
Wednesday and it's neither in those days
but I actually really fun and exciting
news and I'm just gonna try it out up
until Thursday the 23rd of VidCon I'm
going to post a video every single day
so Monday Tuesday and Wednesday
you guys can expect the video and I
don't want to postpone Thursday just
because I'm waking up super early to get
to VidCon I hope you guys enjoy get
ready with me I'm going to voices over
so I can get ready because I'm kind of
in a rush but I hope you enjoyed this
video and it'll be good
so beginning with makeup I'm going to
take my Laura Mercier primer and just
smooth this over my face and then take a
concealer and conceal the veins and just
blend it out with a flat top kabuki
brush and then I'm setting that with
some powder so when the shadows blend
it's super easy I'm using my Too Faced
natural eyes palette and I'm just taking
a brown the shade will be in the downbar
I'm just applying this in my crease and
making sure that it's blended out nice
and evenly and then taking a darker
Brown and applying this to the outer
corner of my eye keeping it below the
crease shade as best as I can but just
to give my eye a little depth and
dimension and it will make it look smoky
and nice and I'm just kind of dragging
it down to that outer third after I'm
mixing those three pretty sparkly shades
and applying that all over my lid just
to give it a little shimmer a little pop
just to add something to the look and
after I am done applying that to the lid
I'm taking that light white kind of
color on a I don't even know what kind
of brush it's is but I'm just blending
out that creates any fluffy or big brush
you have just to blend out those harsh
lines will totally work and then my
signature super thin line of liquid
liner this is my go-to I have to do this
step otherwise my eyes are just not
complete you guys know the drill
after that I'm going to coat my top and
bottom lashes with some serious mascara
all right like this is a must especially
for not wearing falsies I'm actually
getting lash extensions tomorrow so I'm
a little bit nervous well actually when
you're watching this it will be today
but I'm just applying that to my top and
bottom lashes and just making them nice
and full and thick because your girl
needs it oh I didn't apply to my bottom
yet I jumped the gun anyway I'm taking
some those that wasn't English I'm
taking some of those shimmery shades and
just dragging it back on my lower lash
line to give it a little bit more depth
and then I'm taking this light side this
kind of gold light shade in the inner
corner of my lower lash line and then
the dark brown a half of that stick on
the outer corner now I'm going to go in
and apply some bottom mascara
so after this I'm just brushing back my
brows um basically my brow pencil broke
on the other side so I only had this
spoolie so I didn't do anything crazy I
just set them with chapstick and then my
right brow right there um always looked
like a missing spot to it I don't know
where went so I'm then taking these new
Born This Way concealers if you saw my
last video these were featured in them
I'm using the shade light and
light/medium so right now I'm taking
light/medium which is the darker shade
and I'm applying that all over my
blemishes just because I'm not using a
foundation so I'm kind of using these
concealers as a foundation except it's
way lighter and more natural so after I
do that I'm gonna use the light shade to
highlight and conceal so I'm putting
that under my eyes and little triangles
on my forehead
down the bridge of my nose and on my
chin to highlight and conceal you guys
know the drill and blending that out
with a flat top wow I really can't speak
flat top kabuki and then when I get to
the blemishes I kind of Pat that in as
you can see and then I am blending out
the concealer with my damp Beauty
Blender which you guys will see any
second but I just like doing the rest of
my face with a flat top kabuki cuz it
just is so much quicker I find it so
much easier anyway I'm back onto my damp
Beauty Blender blending out my under
eyes making sure that it looks all nice
and natural and super blended you don't
want to look discolored or cakey or
anything like that obviously and then
I'm just setting that with my stay matte
powder by Rimmel and a huge fluffy Real
Techniques brush I'm just pressing this
all into my skin I'm then taking a sigma
tapered brush and the hoola bronzer and
contouring with that um my cheeks both
sides kind of broke out so I feel like
this maybe hides it a little
I'm trying at least so I'm just
contouring with that you guys can
obviously imagine I did that too but I
can't speak the other side and then I'm
just highlighting to finish off the
makeup and keep in mind I put him
chopstick way before so I didn't use
anything on my lips now for hair I am
just taking my hair with my crazy
ponytail that you guys saw it in and the
first thing I'm going to do is I'm going
to brush out this crazy mane it is
literally so insanely naughty and it's
just it's not cute you know
just really not so we're just going to
brush that out and then put that in a
nice tall ponytail and I'm gonna create
a little bun so I'm gonna put my hair in
a ponytail first size thick hair I can't
just put it straight in a bun
unfortunately so I have to tie it in a
ponytail and make sure it's all flat and
good even though it wasn't at all but I
was rushing umm so don't worry ahe's
little pins and clips to keep the bumps
down but I tie that up in a ponytail and
then I twist it around the hair today as
you guys can see and I'm just creating a
bun with that this is just such an easy
go-to for me it takes no time it is
super quick so after we do that we just
wrap that around a few times make sure
you got the look you want and then I'm
just pinning it back with some bobby
pins to make sure it's nice and flat and
then I also just pulled out a few pieces
to make it a little messy it not try so
hard you know the drill after that
straight to that outfit my dress is from
Zara it's an off-the-shoulder and my
shoes are just white converse and thanks
for watching I love you and I'll see you
guys next time bye na</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
