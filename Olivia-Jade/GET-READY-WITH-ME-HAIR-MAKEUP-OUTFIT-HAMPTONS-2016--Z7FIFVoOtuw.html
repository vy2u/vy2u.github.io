channel I hope you're having a wonderful
Sunday um today I am filming this get
ready with me Hamptons edition I'm in
the Hamptons so I thought it'd be fun to
do kind of a get ready with me I don't
know if I'll be in the Hamptons when
you're watching this actually but I
thought it'd be fun to do kind of a get
ready with me
um Hamptons Edition show you what I do
not everyday but when I want to dress up
to be with my family and stuff and this
is the makeup that I do it looks like
it's a lot with the eyes and this kind
of looks kind of smoked out but it's
super super simple and easy
um and then I just keep my hair wet and
crazy when you're spending time with
your family I don't like to just like I
don't care to make myself look that
great um is that bad I don't know so
yeah so I just did my hair I let it air
dry kind of get that beachy wave to it
and then I'm going to show you the
outfit that I am wearing right now it's
super affordable and it is so easy and
you can be wear this dress outfit
whatever so many times so I'm really in
love with this video I hope you guys
enjoy it and let's get started
you
you
so first things first I shower I use my
renewing argan oil of Morocco shampoo
and conditioner and then of course shave
because I'm in the Hamptons so I want to
be nice and smooth for the pool and
that's me out of the shower and let's
get straight onto the makeup the first
thing I do is I prime my skin all the
products will be listed right down below
with the links super easy for you guys
and I'm just applying this all over my
face before I move on to my eyes because
that way I can let it soak in and sit
while I move on to my eye makeup so as I
said products and names will be linked
down below but I'm just blending this
kind of orange shade into my crease and
then taking a white shade on the same
brush and blending up the edges so it's
not harsh and it all just looks super
seamless and natural then onto brows I
am just brushing them back so they look
a little bit more tamed I'm not running
any products through them just because I
want to keep this a little bit more on
the natural shot
wow that was in English on the natural
side and then after I comb through my
brows I go back what's in Olivia video
if I don't draw something I go back in
with my Too Faced palette and I mix
those three shades together and just
blend that on my lid and I'm just kind
of adding this for an extra shimmer it
just makes it look like you put a little
bit more effort but it's so easy and
then I'm taking that fluffy side and
blending out the harsh edges so it's
again super seamless and natural and
then I'm taking this flat shader brush
and I'm putting that in like this dark
cocoa brown shade and I'm just using
this as a liner kind of just kind of
smoke it out make it look a little bit
more I don't know just a little bit more
smoky you know and I'm just basically
blending that on my lash line I'm not
bringing it above its being super super
precise and super close to my lash line
and yeah that's all I'm really doing I'm
taking that purple shade in that same
brown shade and I'm just running this on
my lower lash line for a little bit more
dimension to make the look pop it makes
all the difference
then I am just brushing out my lashes
for those of you that didn't know I have
Lodge extensions and I don't know if I'm
going to keep getting them just because
I sleep on my face I don't take that
good care of them anything that you're
supposed to do I don't really do um and
then I am just on my bottom lashes
applying some mascara to make them pop
and then I'm also making my eyes pop by
putting a light shimmery shade in the
inner corners and then I'm using this
concealer that's the exact same shade as
my skin tone it's amazing and it's a
two-faced born this way and I am just
applying this all over my problem spots
and since I didn't use any foundation I
did go a little crazy with my concealer
as you can see and then I am just
blending this out with a Beauty Blender
this is my favorite way to use concealer
I think it gives it a really natural
glowy dewy effect and it most
importantly looks natural and not cakey
which is what I love personally so yeah
that's what I'm doing and I'm just
continue to Pat that into my skin and
blend it out and then I am moving on to
my favorite part which is baking I use
my Laura Mercier translucent powder and
a Beauty Blender to set under my eyes
and basically I just pack this on and
then I let that sit while I bronze and
contour my skin and then I don't really
know that I'm new to both the powder and
the baking but it's literally my
obsession it makes my concealer lasts so
long so so far so good and then I'm just
kind of blending this bronzer all over
my skin to make myself look nice and
glowy and bronze and then after I'm done
with that I just wipe away baked äj--
and then to finish off the face part I
am setting my makeup with the Urban
Decay setting spray and what I like to
do is I like applying my cream highlight
right after I do this just because I
think it gives it kind of a dewy or
glowy look and then I just blend that
out with my Beauty Blender I did notice
I had mascara under my eye so I will get
to that in a second I'm just using my
Kylie lip kit just the liner in exposed
to line my lips and I'm not putting that
actual liquid lipstick because it's a
little bit more subtle if you just do
the liner so I wiped off my under eyes I
just didn't show it and then I just
reapplied a light concealer to keep it
bright and highlighted and to cover up
any dark mascara that I miss and then
moving on to my outfit as I said in the
beginning everything will be linked down
below but my dress is from brandy
melville my shoes err Isabel Marant and
my bra let I believe is Free People but
I don't know I thought this tablet was
cute and casual and it's super super
wearable so I hope you guys like it so
that is it for my get ready with me at
hamptons edition kind of video I hope
you guys enjoyed it just leave video
requests down below I'm so excited that
you guys suck through the end of this
