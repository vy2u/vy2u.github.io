get ready with me so let's just get
straight into the video the first thing
I'm doing is I'm applying my Burt's Bees
chapstick in like the violent tint
scented kind of lip balm situation and
then I go straight in with the
moisturizer this is my Neutrogena
moisturizer no no and I just apply that
all over my face and then straight to
brows I use my honest Razia brow is
because oh no it's my brow Feiner it's
just easy it's simple and I just do the
tips and that's all I fill in as you can
see I'll have my everyday makeup routine
it's my last video will be linked down
below if you haven't seen it and
basically doing that makeup look but
maybe a little different since I'm going
to a couple meetings today so then I use
my handy dandy euros lipstick chaps
nup not lipstick chapstick chat balm to
set my brows this is my favorite trick
and you guys seem to love it when I
showed it in my everyday makeup routine
and then I go in with my makeup forever
step one equalising primer and I decided
to use this with a little sponge I guess
you could call it and I just patted that
all out into my skin I don't really
notice a difference when I did this I
was just trying something else so I
didn't get my hands dirty but whatever
works then I'm going in with this new
foundation I just picked up and I was
pleasantly surprised it's the true Match
Lumi like cushion foundation and I just
applied it with a Beauty Blender it was
the perfect shade for me and it went on
so naturally it left my skin so
refreshed and glowing and you guys can
kinda just see that outcome it's amazing
then I don't want to show you the whole
clip you've seen it a thousand times I'm
using my superstay better skin concealer
by Maybelline and I'm just concealing my
tired bags as you can see this was early
in the morning I was exhausted I look
tired and in the morning my face like I
don't really have a jawline
it's just like really puffy and gross so
I'm trying to work with that right now
I'm just blending that out with my damp
Beauty Blender and honestly these two
products together are both drugstore and
they totally felt
Cayenne like they're amazing of course
priming my lids not even priming them
really for anything special I just hate
the veins on my lids so this is a super
quick and easy trick just to make your
eyelid look flawless you know and then
I'm just setting that with powder
because I did end up applying some
shadow and that just makes it easier to
blend and then I'm also using my stay
matte powder and my Sigma tapered brush
to set my under eyes and just kind of
the spots that get the most oily
then I'm going in with my dream catcher
palette from NYX I'd never used this
before but I'm mixing those two shades
on the edge of the palette and I'm just
applying that into my crease I've been
doing a really unprofessional trick
lately because I've only wanted to use a
couple of my brushes since I just washed
all of them so I have this brush for
eyeshadow and then I just use my tapered
brush to blend it out you'll see what I
mean so I just used my e25 Sigma
blending brush to blend that into my
crease pretty precisely and then after
I'm done blending that into my crease
and kind of dragging it on my lid a
little bit I like to take that tapered
brush that I used to literally highlight
and like set my powder and whatnot to
blend it out because I don't want to get
my other brushes dirty I know I'm gonna
have to use them at some point but then
I'm just applying that white shimmer
shade to my inner corners to highlight
and brighten my brow bone as well after
that my go-to I'm just applying a really
thin line of my liquid eyeliner by Kat
Von D you get better with this as
practice and time goes by I promise it
can be frustrating but once you get the
hang of it it's really not bad
and then I'm going in with my big eyes
mascara I love this stuff it is a lower
lash side on my upper and lower lashes
and I'm just showing you what I'm doing
I'm just coating my lashes and look at
that difference it's amazing I love it
so much and I sped up the process
because it's super repetitive and it's
the same thing but then I go my lower
lashes and then I just coat the other
side again then I use my master conceal
by Maybelline and I got the darkest
shade from the drugstore and I'm using
this to cream contour I just wanted to
try this out because I just had an idea
that maybe it would work and I wasn't
like crazy happy but I wasn't mad at all
like it turned out pretty beautiful so
affordable easy cream contour and then I
just blended that all out to get myself
some bronzed glowy look and then I'm
just taking a q-tip wiping away that
dried mascara if you get mascara
anywhere just let it dry for a couple
seconds and then it's super easy to just
wipe off then lip liner I'm using my NYX
lip pencil in the shade natural I'm just
lining my lips super quickly this is
kind of like a brownish pink color and
yeah you guys can economize we have
maybe candy or Dolce K but a little bit
different by Kylie cosmetics and then
I'm highlighting with my what's up or
what's up I always say that wrong but
this is my favorite highlighter I just
apply it straight from the tube and then
blend it out with my Beauty Blender
and then I just set it all with my Urban
Decay setting spray I went a little
overboard on this not going to lie and
then I just applied chapstick no tint
nothing just a plain chapstick to finish
off the makeup straight onto hair my
hair was crazy I showered the night
before and then slept with it so it was
still a little damp as you might be able
to see but I know this is bad for your
hair but I decided to just straighten it
anyway it was dry for the most part and
I just separate my hair into two
ponytails this is my little trick for
straightening your hair you start with
one section and you guys will be able to
see what I'm doing but I basically just
start with a little section of my head
and strain it in the ponytail and then I
keep doing that little sections until I
think most of it is straightened and
then I just kind of keep going over the
ponytail and straightening it and it's a
super fast and easy way to straighten
your hair
then when I'm done with that I take my
hair out of the ponytail and I just
brush it out and then I'm gonna
fast-forward through this pretty much -
but I just section it off with my
hairbrush and straighten it that ends as
you'll be able to see so I just take
those sections and I keep doing that
until that whole half of my head is
completely straightened
then after I did the other side I didn't
show it because you guys know the drill
I just brush it out straighten the
pieces and that's that straight on to
the outfit now I am wearing this outfit
