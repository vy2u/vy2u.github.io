channel it's Olivia Jade if you're new
here in today's video as you can tell
about the title I am doing it get ready
with me for like a beach day I'm
currently in Mexico right now so this is
a real time get ready with me but it is
in collab with Sephora collection you
guys know I'm one of their ambassadors I
work with them all the time if you're
new here and then now you're filled in a
little bit but today I'm showing you
guys their new cream lip stains you guys
are gonna freak out over them I'm
wearing one right now and I'm gonna show
you three of them but they've actually
just released new shades from number 46
to 105 so I'm gonna insert a huge vault
they sent me right here and it's pretty
incredible
so these Sephora collection cream lip
stains launched exclusively on the
sephora mobile app on the 11th of April
on Sephora calm on the 12th of April and
in stores on the 13th of April make sure
you guys are following a Sephora
collection on Instagram their Instagram
is just at SC I'll have it right here
they're gonna be hosting a ton of
giveaways and prizes around this launch
so you guys definitely want to make sure
you're following them so you guys can
keep up with all of that and with that
all being said let's get started I
really hope you guys love this video and
stick around for my beach outfit as well
because I think you guys gonna like it
okay so the first thing I'm doing is
applying a little bit of this Too Faced
hangover primer also put sunscreen on
before if you're going for a beach look
like I am it's so important to protect
your skin the freckles are cute but that
is skin damage technically so I really
kind of just let that soak into my skin
and then I go in with like a concealer
or tinted moisturizer since this is a
video I'm gonna do attention moisturizer
and a concealer because we're going all
out and I'll use this for some photos
today and stuff but obviously when I'm
in the water in the beach I usually just
put sunscreen on and maybe a little bit
of waterproof mascara that's the bare
minimum that wouldn't make a very
entertaining video though so we are
going full out today well full out but
like still super natural so I'm using my
favorite Laura Mercier tinted
moisturizer it's the oil-free one I
absolutely love this and I'm just going
to take a little on my hand and
I had to my face my face is a little bit
splotchy and super freckly from the Sun
even though I've been wearing sunscreen
it just they always come out in the Sun
so just go a little bit around this is
super light coverage so you can be a
little bit crazy with it we're gonna use
my Beauty Blender and I'm a mirror right
here so I'm just going to blend out my
body's always darker than my face so
that's why I put a little bit of a
darker shade sometimes when it's like
not even even though I know this isn't
technically what you're supposed to do I
just kind of rub it around cuz I want it
to look all one shade don't want you to
know so now that that is all applied I
just kind of go over make sure it looks
nice and then I'm gonna go in with a
little bit of my concealer so I do a
really tiny bit this is my NARS creamy
concealer in custard and I'm just going
to tap this like in the inner corners
and then right here and around my nose
oh my god my freckles on my upper lip
are crazy they always come out right
there then I'm gonna use my finger to
melt this in I might go over with a
Beauty Blender just to like do the
finishing touch but for the most part I
just use my finger I like that my
freckles show I think it's cute and it's
natural so don't try and cover your
beautiful freckles people and then I
just spray my Beauty Blender with any
sort of spray you have whatever even
just like a mist with like a little bit
of water and then I'm taking this for a
collection matte perfection powder
foundation in the shade 14 and I like to
see how there's a little wet spots
because I always do this I just take my
sponge like this and I said I don't use
like translucent loose powder because I
feel like this is just a little bit
lighter and I love this powder now it's
like my
give him any space I just take a brash
in a bronzer and I warm up the skin just
a little bit on the cheeks and I try and
keep this part pretty natural and then I
also just take it over my eyes a little
bit just for that bronze aglow I am
going to go in with my brow gel this is
support collections just brow gel and
the shape clear zero one it's my
favorite for when I'm not filling in my
eyebrows because it kind of just makes
them look perfect
I don't it can't even I don't know why I
can't explain it it might be like the
applicator but look so crazy and then
just kind of brush it out like my other
brow gels do not do this they don't
understand just like tames it so much I
could recommend anything for brows it's
this product like what I don't know how
or why does that but it doesn't even
fill them in it just makes them look
decent okay and not for mascara I just
do a little bit on my upper lashes this
is my Tarte lights camera splashes so it
is waterproof but guests all over the
place it's totally fine I'm just gonna
let it dry a little bit gets a little
bit above my eyelid right now but I'm
not tripping it's all good so I'm gonna
let that dry and then I'll come back for
my favorite part which are the lips
which you guys are gonna freak out about
so the first shade I'm going to show you
guys from this for collection of creamy
lip scenes is this one it is in the
shade 109 and it's one of their
metallics it's absolutely gorgeous the
finishes for these lip stains are crazy
they come in matte satin and metallic
and I'm going to be using this metallic
one right here and they're really
pigmented which is awesome and
what do you guys think about the slip
color metallic hi Bella
Charlotte love you doesn't even dry out
your lips it's gorgeous
it kind of transforms from like like a
creamy sort of formula until like a
satin stain but it's not drying and it's
super comfortable so this is first shade
and I really like it let me show you
guys some others so you guys can really
get an idea of the whole range so I'm
going to show you guys this nude next
this one is in the shade 71 and I
absolutely love it
so I'm just going to apply this straight
on the lips
you guys fun fact as a pie this
obviously it's really smooth it's
because it's infused with avocado oil so
it delivers really rich color it feels
comfortable it's not sticky it's also
super silky and long-lasting it's gonna
keep your lips covered from the morning
all the way to the night so you don't
really have to worry about touch ups or
reapplying so this is what this shade
looks like it's honestly just a better
shade of my natural lips so I'm really
obsessed with it and I think it looks
really nice it doesn't crack or dry or
anything and I'm so blown away because
it just looks perfect with this whole
look so now I'm gonna show you guys my
favorite shade this is when I went to
their headquarters in San Francisco like
in February this is a shade that hadn't
been out yet and I was obsessed with and
hurry up so I'm gonna show you guys it
it was like my color when I was there so
this is this for collection cream lip
stain in the shade 78 this is my perfect
vibrant red with an orange undertone and
I absolutely live for this as you can
tell it's like my favorite color right
now for the summer and spring time and
yeah here we go just one swipe and
you're good I absolutely love this shade
and it's obviously super vibrant I only
really needed one swipe and here it is
and it's gorgeous and it feels super
comfortable and it doesn't really feel
like I have a lip stain on which is like
my least favorite feeling when you can
actually feel lipstick on you or liquid
like a liquid lipstick on you is little
worse so this is like perfect so this is
it for the makeup look I'm going to show
you guys

photoshoot day I guess so let's go
