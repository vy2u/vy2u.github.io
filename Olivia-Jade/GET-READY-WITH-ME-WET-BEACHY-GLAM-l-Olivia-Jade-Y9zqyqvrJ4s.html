a little bit repetitive some might say I
am just gonna film a get ready with me
you guys know how much I love filming
these I know you guys enjoy them so I
thought why not this is currently my
situation not looking the best I just
got out of the shower probably like 30
minutes ago and I've just had my hair
like this I don't know if I talked you
for your hair but whatever I wash my
face in the shower with my lancer
skincare and I've been really into this
tatcha luminous deep hydrating firming
serum and it's like 95 dollars at
Sephora so it is really expensive but I
just miss your skin feel really hydrated
and refreshed
um so today's look isn't going to be
anything crazy I think I'm just going to
do something really glowy and bronzy and
probably very simple on the eyes I
wanted to try this Hollywood glam glow
mega illuminating moisturizer for a
while now so I guess I'll just try it
while I'm getting ready this morning
it's a moisturizer that's supposed to
really make your skin glow my plans for
the day are just wow that is really
glowy um it smells good I don't really
know what I'm doing for the day I'm
really gonna get my nails done I have
been really in I have a treadmill in my
house and I never use the treadmill in
my house like ever it's horrible um I
just straight-up choose like not to ever
use it and it just kind of goes to waste
because we have this really nice funnel
and nobody uses it so I started to use
it and now I'm really upset around for
miles I don't know why I did that it's
like a lot for someone who never runs on
the treadmill I guess
I'm really good about working out I love
going to my workout classes and stuff
but like that obviously gets really
expensive and I have the treadmill so I
was like why wouldn't I just use it but
this morning I don't know what I was
running my whole heart felt like it was
gonna fall off I don't know what was
happening
so I ran two miles and then I walked out
an incline of ten which made my booty
hurt for another mile so I was like
three miles we're a brow pencil I found
it it's just going to be a really chatty
video because I feel like I want to do
that um what else is new I posted this
video yesterday of this beginners makeup
tutorial and a lot of you guys loved it
I just want to say I didn't realize how
many high end products I was using so if
you saw that video you do not have to go
to Sephora and drop hundreds and
hundreds of dollars especially as a
beginner there are so many good
drugstore juice if you just look up the
product online and then just type in
dupe DUP e and a bunch of stuff will
come up so just thought I would throw
that out there this isn't really a
tutorial so I'm not explaining what I'm
doing but I will list all the products
I'm using down below for you guys of
course um so again this might be a lot
of similar products you have seen in my
videos just because I'm just getting
ready for my day and these are like my
all-time face what I use every single
day um my bras I don't think are ever
going to be even if they hate me or
something
oh I found my favorite necklace well I
didn't lose it I had to take it off for
a photo shoot and it got really really
tangled and that this Tyler gave me it
for my birthday like last year
a long time ago and I have and I like
usually don't take it off just because
it's like so beautiful it's my favorite
necklace which I'm Tiffany and I love it
has a lot of like good meeting obviously
it was just tangled and then I finally
untangled it I like was like what am i
doing I need this in my life again so
here we are just blending this kind of
dorky Brown that straight into my crease
i'm using the morphe 35o palette again
this isn't a tutorial so this is just me
kind of playing around I don't know what
look I'm going for but I'm kind of IDing
with it I'm just taking like dark Browns
and messing around I'm really going to
miss like your guys's interaction every
single day um after Christmas like I
physically don't think I could forever
post every single day just because I
don't even think you guys realize how
crazy busy my December has been trying
to film every day it's honestly insanity
but I'm definitely going to be sad like
not having to like not getting to see
your guys's comments every single day on
my videos and stuff but of course this
will be posting once a week you could
all note that though um but yeah it's
definitely really fun and different and
it was like a challenge posting every
day but we still have a few days left so
let's not be too sad yet who are kind of
like that matte white color like cream
see
okay I'm going to prime my skin with you
know the go to know why it makes that
noise it's really annoying I've decided
I'm going to just put this in like my um
tight line we're gonna do that and then
curl my lashes so I've decided I'm not
doing falsies or top liner I guess I'm
just gonna do a lot of mascara so it
start to lengthening one but our use the
lengthening only on my bottom lashes I'm
not going to use better than sex on my
bottom and then I'm going to go in with
my better than socks so what I think I'm
going to do is move on to my foundation
or CC cream you guys don't even have to
announce what this is everyone knows
everyone's building the light that it's
the only thing I ever use but if you
like something vibe in it
stick with it I'm just going to go a
little under my eyes and I think back
that I'm like really not trying to do
anything crazy right now I'm really just
going for that natural look setting oh
but where I placed that concealer you'll
know I'm not bathing by the way I'm just
pressing this in right away like I
really can't keep anything my hand oh oh
my god good
who was here like I really start about
my hair I apologize like 100 times but
it's ugly uh who was here back in the
day of my youtube channel when I
literally when I tell you I could not
keep anything in my hand everything I
touched would fall out like I would drop
things I'd throw things it was horrible
it's so pretty actually I want to like
put this all over my face because it's
not like a highlight it's not super
intense
I'm using exposed by the way and yeah I
think that color looks really nice kind
of matches with like this beachy glam
vibe but that's it for this video
I'm so sorry for just how casual it was
and I'm sorry I keep looking the
viewfinder it's just because I think ooh
you press that it I think it's just
because my hair looks so bad so I want
to like see it but I guess it's annoying
so thank you for watching I'm really
sorry for how casual this it and I love
you guys if you aren't subscribed this
was a shitty video but you can subscribe
anyway thanks for watching I love you
and I'll see you guys next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
