room I'm going to be doing the get to
know me tag although I've had this
channel for two years and I feel like a
lot of you know me pretty well because I
livestream all the time and do little
things like that I thought I would
actually sit down and do the tags I've
never done anything like 50 questions I
wear the TMI tag where they get to know
me time nothing

basketball well I don't fight anymore
but I played basketball since I was like
three years old you know Little League
super intense and then the stalker was
also intensive played it since I was
like three or four on like all these
little teams and it was really fun
actually like I remember game days were
so fun and I'm a half-time we don't sit
in a circle and eat our little oranges
and I remember when I was little I would
get a white board when I got home and
pretend I'd sat on my stuffed animals
around and I pretend that I was the
coach because our country boys had like
the soccer board and he'd draw plays out
and I thought it was so cool the way
he's talking so then when I got home I
would draw a place out on my whiteboard
and set all my stuff animals around what

want to get into reading because I once

go to Mexico every single year with like
a bunch of families for like my second
families like someone who's like my
second mom birthday party and that's
definite like my favorite childhood
memory like I guess it's not like a
childhood memories or like I'm child so
do you speak any different languages and
how well I do I take Spanish in school
how well uh I can get by I can
understand that I can like almost I can
say what I need to say but like you
could not just throw me in a
conversation and I could not just like
roll with it do you have any siblings
yes if two siblings had an older brother
who a lot of you didn't know existed
he's my older brother he's 25 um he just
doesn't live here cuz he's older now so

describe my fashion sense as very simple
what is your favorite restaurant I know
my favorite restaurant in the whole
entire world is when I was in Muskoka
with Tyler's family this past summer and
it was this restaurant called Lake Joe

and I don't know what number 30 tell us
one of your bad habits my boys just
croaked and one of my bad habits I don't
know what's necessarily a bad habit but
I often find that it's not worth it in
the end I always give people that have
like done me wrong like a second chance
or they go which I see the best event I
was trying to make friends with them
again or anything like that and I've
kind of learned that like if they've
done something like really bad that like
really hurt your feelings just like move
on that's like a bad it's not like a
habit but like it's a bad trait I have
like I'm very willing to forgive and
forget and just move on that like it
didn't happen but then I think about
what they've done and I'm like ouch and
I'm not saying like go and perfect like
I'm sure we all have done something to
someone else or someone's doing
something to you that's really hurt your
feelings so yeah that's probably what
I'm gonna answer that question with oh

and I kept looking like a little snake
was on my floor so that's it for my
video thank you so so much for watching
my team get to know me die and I hope
