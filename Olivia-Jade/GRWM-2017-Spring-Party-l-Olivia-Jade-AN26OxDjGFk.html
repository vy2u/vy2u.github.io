hey hey guys welcome back to my channel
in today's video I'm going to be doing a
get ready with me this is actual legit
writing action to go right now so let's
start the video I hope you guys enjoy it
make sure to give it a thumbs up
subscribe to learn already and let's go
7 ok so I just basically parted my hair
in the middle and now I'm going to spray
a little dry shampoo throughout it so
I'm going to use this product from curls
and it's like my 3 Way hairspray so for
light and will give a softer hold if I
do a medium friend of fashion styling
and heavy will give a really harmful
okay so now on to the makeup this is
going to be really quick it's been
getting ready I'm not doing a tutorial
so you're going to see review products
I'm going to use will be listed below
but I need to get ready for it like I'm
actually doing somewhere I can't take my
time so yeah I hope you guys enjoyed
makeup look I'm going to do a really
fresh base salt do we highlighted
probably a little like cream bronzer in
my crease make me a super super fresh
looking so I hope you're enjoying so to
start with the eyes I'm going to be
applying a little bit of liquid like a
felt tip eyeliner to my top lash line
and I'm also going to be going in with a
little bit of my better than sex mascara
okay so photos what is she doing this
new trick I do is I basically just put
mascara everywhere and I coat my lashes
so so much but I can use my mouth guards
the best visibility and then I go in
with makeup remover wipe or like a q-tip
and I want it away so I'm going to go do
that when did you blender and over back
okay so now actually start
I love playing as if it cosmetics
moisturizer as I said I will have direct
links down below but I absolutely love
this I don't know if it's new or not but
it's amazing and then I'm going in with
my it cosmetics CC cream I have a new
tutorial coming out soon where I use a
bunch of new products but since this was
it get ready with me
I'm still hooked on this product and I
was going to a pool birthday party so it
kind of worked perfectly and then going
in with a little bit of my Born This Way
concealer I feel like you guys are going
to get so annoyed because I'm using all
the same products but it's honestly just
to realize get ready with me and I'm
doing the it nope not a cosmetics sorry
Kunie chubby stick which I love and I'm
just blending both those products out
with my Beauty Blender I think both of
these are so blendable and so pretty for
summertime because it gives you just
like the most beautiful glow so I'm then
going to just blend out my creases
before going in with my Laura Mercier
translucent powder and just once again
setting my under eyes I feel so bad and
using all different products I'm going
in with my goomah bronzer and just
warming up my face kind of going over
where I put that Clinique chubby 6 I
keep forgetting the names of products
it's really not it's been a while um so
yeah I'm just kind of warming up my face
to fat and then I'm going in with this
Charlotte Tilbury powder which I don't
think I've used on my channel before but
I absolutely love it it's so silky and
pretty and then a little bit of eyebrows
which I didn't show because if I feel
all the time but I'm then just spraying
my face with this mist from Chanel which
Mario Badescu rose water works great as
well and I'm going in with this I forget
the name but it's a cream highlighter
it's amazing again Ovie link down below
and I am just kind of blending that with
my fingers going over it with my Beauty
Blender just making sure it looks kind
of like I'm going from within and then
I'm going in with my Mac highlighter and
just applying it over topping sauce and
then a little bit of chopped tuna just
moisturize my lips and then my shirt is
brandy melville my shorts are 1 teaspoon
and my shoes are feet matted thank you

it I love you guys so much hi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
