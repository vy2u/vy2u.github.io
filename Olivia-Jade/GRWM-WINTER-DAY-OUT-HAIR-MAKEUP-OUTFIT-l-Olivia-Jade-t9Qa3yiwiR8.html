ready with me winter day out Edition
I've done this for it summer and for
fall so it's only appropriate to keep
the trend going and film one for the
winter just kind of you just watch me
get ready and I'm going to show you my
hair my outfit and this look so if you
guys want to see how to recreate this or
just watch how I got ready for this day
then please keep watching don't forget
to give it a thumbs up if you liked it
ready with me get ready get ready with
me yeah or if you guys aren't subscribed
would mean so so much to me if you hit
the subscribe button um seriously it
means like that salute world so with
that being said I hope you guys enjoyed
this video and let's get started so to
start out with the makeup I'm using my
Mario Badescu rose water spray and just
spraying this all over my face and then
I'm using this tatcha luminous kind of
serum I guess it is pretty expensive I
got it at Sephora and I'm just applying
this to my face it's definitely worth
the money though because it makes your
makeup look so much better when it's on
your skin and then lastly I'm just
priming with my Smashbox photo-finish
priming water this is just so there's no
foundation directly going on my face and
I'm then going in with my honest Razia
brow Wiz in the shade soft brown and I
am just filling in my brows how I
normally would and I just sped through
this a little bit because you guys see
this all the time but I also wanted you
to be able to see what I'm doing so um
yeah it's just this clip showing you
what I do with my brows I just try and
get them as even as possible um
sometimes they have good days sometimes
I have bad days it totally depends so
after I finish my brows I set them with
the honest Razia clear brow gel I prefer
using a clear brow gel but sometimes
like a tinted one also makes them look a
little bit thicker and then going in
with a little bit of concealer and just
priming my eyes with this and blending
it out with a Beauty Blender obviously
you want to blend it out and this is
just to conceal the veins when we put
the eyeshadow on it just looks a lot
smoother and then setting that concealer
with my Laura Mercier translucent powder
and I'm using my morphe 35o palette I'm
taking
those two brown burgundy shades and
applying those straight into my crease
this is to just give some dimension and
make the eye look just kind of tie
together especially when you see in a
little I'm gonna put shimmer so you'll
see
but I'm then going in with a darker
brown and a smaller more precise brush
and just applying this to the outer
third of my lid and then once again
blending it out with my big fluffy brush
and as you will see right now I'm
applying some shimmer so I just took the
first couple shades in the morphe 35o
palette and applied that straight to my
eyelid and these are so so pigmented so
I'm pretty much obsessed with these I
just use a flat shader brush to apply
those and then blend it back out with my
big crease brush I bring in those shades
the two Browns I put my crease in
beginning on my lower lash line and then
I'm also bringing those shoes right here
on the inner corners of my eye just to
tie the whole look in and then using the
tiniest amount of liquid eyeliner I by
the way I just didn't show it but I
wiped out the fallout from underneath my
eyes and then I'm applying a little bit
of liquid liner curling my lashes this
lash brothers from Sephora but you can
get these with drugstore really anywhere
and then going in with my all-time
favorite mascara right now seriously
this is the best I forgot how good it
was it's the Too Faced better than sex
mascara and it's so so so good it kind
of just makes it look like you have
really natural false lashes on and I
love doing this without any makeup and
just like a BB cream and that's
basically been my look all weekend so I
love it and after I'm using my holy girl
it cosmetics CC cream and this is in the
shade light and I'm just applying this
with a damp Beauty Blender all over my
face it matches my skin so well so I am
just dabbing that in to my skin with my
damp Beauty Blender as I said making
sure to bring it down my neck and apply
it throughout the whole entire face so
that we get a really nice even amount of
coverage and
this product is everything I mentioned
it in my November favorites but I
seriously mean it when I say you have to
try it and then using my Too Faced Born
This Way concealer in the shade
light/medium and just highlighting and
concealing and then again blending that
out with my damn Beauty Blender this
isn't an intense highlight or anything
too crazy it is supposed to look a
little bit more on the natural side but
I am still just rolling with it blending
it out with my Debu lender making it
sure it looks as natural as it possibly
can and then I'm going to set that with
my Laura Mercier powder and this more
precise kind of dense tapered brush I
really like this brush I just got it
from Sigma and I'm just applying this to
the places I highlighted and then as
you'll see right now I'm taking a huge
powder brush and just blending that all
over I'm not letting it bake for a super
long time as you see I kind of blended
it out with my big powder brush right
away so yeah I love doing that it just
lets the makeup sit on your face all
night long or all day and then I'm using
this Too Faced bronzer and it's like the
chocolate Soleil bronzer and I'm just
using it with a little contour brush
actually kind of a bigger version of a
contour brush and called roaring and
warming up my cheekbones I love this
product because it kind of gives a
natural shadow I'm also bringing that on
the temples and on my cheeks this is
just to make me look sunkissed warm up
my face
I know it's winter but you guys know I
love being bronzed all the time um and
really glowy as I say in a second
so then I'm using my Mario Badescu rose
water spray or I highlight I'm using the
top shades of the morphe 35o palette and
oh my god wait till you see this like
what just wow wow so it is really
intense but when you blend it out with a
Beauty Blender I use my damp one and it
made it look like you were literally
glowing from within it is so stunning so
definitely my new favorite highlighter I
wish they sold these as actual
highlights because it's the best
highlighter I've ever used in my life
I'm so obsessed so I just apply that to
my cheekbones so the tip of my nose
I'm going to apply that to my Cupid's
bow and really just make myself glow to
the gods because I mean how can't you
with that product it's so pretty and
then using a little bit of chapstick and
applying that to my lips and then taking
a lip liner that basically matches my
natural lip shade this is from Make Up
For Ever and I am just lining my lips
with it I don't know the actual shade
I'm so sorry but I am just using that to
fill them in and just kind of give some
sort of color I'm finishing off the
makeup with my Mario Badescu rose water
spray once again and that's the finished
makeup and I really loved how it turned
out
so now for hair I was not having the
worst hair day so I just had to use a
little bit of dry shampoo to give it
texture to make it look fresh you know
and then I just played around with my
fingers and kind of adjusted it to how I
wanted it and it kind of turned out fine
so yay for no heat
um and it looked alright so that's the
finished I are super quick and then for
my outfit some pieces are affordable and
some are pretty expensive so the top is
from PacSun I believe it sold out I put
it in my cyber monday clothing haul the
jeans are from AG and then if my shoes
are my Gucci slides I got this for my
birthday I know some people are gonna
hate on those because I know they have
fur and they're expensive but I did get
them for my birthday I do want to get
use out of them so that's the finished
outfit thank you so so much for watching
