back to my youtube channel in today's
video I'm so excited because it's kind
of like they get ready with me for prom
although it's not like a real time get
ready with me because I'm not actually
getting ready for prom right now but
this video has been so requested because
people are going to prom pretty soon and
people need some inspiration so I
decided I'd come up with a makeup look a
hairstyle and show you guys how to do it
step-by-step and then also three
different dress options and all the
clothing and stuff is from Windsor so
it's super affordable thank you so much
to Windsor for sponsoring this video by
the way we'll talk more about the
dresses at the end of the video but if
you guys want to see how to get this
makeup and hair and then these three
outfits then just keep watching I really
hope you all enjoy and yeah let's start
with the hair first things first take
out the hair part it however a clip
would have definitely worked the best
just working with what I have I'm going
to start with this section and I
literally just start with the back take
about like this much hair I leave parts
of the end out so it's not super cold
all the way through it like has a nice
beachy kind of look just like that
for that cutting a glove I'll burn
myself
it goes way faster if you have a glove
because you don't have to worry about
burning yourself obviously sometimes I
like to change the direction which I'm
curling just for like some texture
sometimes my hair stylist does that so
I'm just copying him see how I always
leave a piece out that's so it doesn't
get like super curly and like ring like
it's more like a beachy wave be super
careful of your neck so that's how it's
done
looks cute let's do this side now this
is what the bottom half looks like now
see how it's like a nice curl and then
it kind of goes straight that's what I
want it to happen so do these tights
I've been curling my hair for about 12
minutes now if you're wondering how long
it takes so that was just the bottom and
I have very thick hair look again I'm
gonna do this side first before I do
that I'm gonna gather the hair that I've
already done and just kind of like throw
it back there throw this side back there
and then so it holds its curl I'm just
gonna put in like a really loose wave or
everything this bun sorry so I'm just
going to take it with like a school
actually yeah I'll just take it was like
a scrunchie yeah see okay now let's do
this side so this shouldn't take too
long I only have this front section
let's start with the back this is a part
that's really gonna be seen so you want
to make sure you try your hardest
when it gets to the front section I
split it into two and with the back
section I roll it under this way like
towards my head leaving a big strand out
and then pulling it away and then for
this section here I roll it away from my
face it's back to this and you only have
five minutes apart you're back at school
times YouTube stress
then for this final part put it into two
I do this going down in this last
section away really making sure to leave
this strand out then I'm just taking
this back part out this is what it looks
like when you're done it's nice and then
I obviously will touch up pieces that I
feel like need to be touched up I like
to use a little texture spray this is or
bead and I just kind of like put out the
roots there so it has a little bit of
height so yeah I love how it's like a
beachy wave and then it goes flat into
like a loose wave I also obviously will
use a little bit of hairspray this one
is the redkin hairspray I don't know it
doesn't really matter to me I just don't
little bit yeah so that's what the hair
looks like I think this is gorgeous for
prom I feel like it flatters everyone so
let me know what you guys think down
below if you guys want more hair
tutorials I know I always say I suck at
them so you think this is sucky then I
won't do any more but if you like how
this looks I have a few more tricks up
my sleeves that I've learned from my
hairstylist from going to events and
stuff and like him helping me so yeah if
you guys want more tutorials I guess
just let me know so now let's get on to
the makeup so first things first
I'm gonna prep my skin I'm using this
fresh eye serum whatever you have works
any eye cream whatever just hydrates you
and then using this Bobbi Brown enriched
face base I love this for priming the
skin I love how much moisture it brings
but also it gives like a really smooth
base so after I've applied that I'm
going in with this NYX pore filler I
just apply this in like my t-zone kind
of where my pores are a little bit
larger because this seriously smooths
out your skin like crazy so I love this
and then moving straight onto the eyes
I'm gonna conceal and prime with my
Maybelline age rewind concealer and I'm
just applying this all over my lid and
then
with a little bit of my Maybelline fit
me powder after that I'm then going in
with this morphe 35o our palette and I'm
just taking a fluffy brush and just a
bronzed transition shade and applying
this straight to the crease and I'm not
being too careful it's not a big deal if
it's a little bit messy it can be a more
smokey vibe and then going in with a
more precise brush and that darker shade
and just kind of deepening the outer
corner this is the star of the show it's
the color pop super shock shadow in the
shade birthday girl I'm just applying
this all over my eyelids and it is
gorgeous it kind of makes it look like
you put so much more effort when in
reality it was so quick and easy so
that's ideal and then going in with this
elf black pencil and I'm just lining my
top lashline and smudging it out and
then back in with that transition shade
I am just applying this to my lower lash
to make sure it looks super even and
nice and smoky and BAM now that both
eyes are done I'm going in with my
Ardell with Spees and I just cut them
and use the outer corners I like the
look of this because it kind of brings
your eye up and gives you like a cat eye
effect instead of using like the whole
lash sometimes it can bring your eyes
down a little bit
so after that I'm going back in with my
super shock shadow in the shade birthday
girl and I am just applying this a
little bit more on the lid just to
intensify it in case we lost any color
in the process of our lashes and then
I'm gonna take this mascara and blend my
upper lashes with the falsies and yeah
that's what I'm doing for the eyes for
now we'll come back to the lower lash
lip them a little bit later but now for
foundation this is my Too Faced Born
This Way I love this there's no
flashback so it's perfect for something
like prom or an event where you're gonna
be taking a ton of pictures especially
flash photography and then going in with
my Maybelline age rewind concealer and I
am using a generous amount because I
want to look flawless in these photos so
I'm just gonna take a damp sponge and
blend that all out and make it look
super flawless and then right after I
blend it I'm not gonna waste any time
I'm setting that right away with my
Maybelline fit me powder I really like
this I think it's very comparable to
like the Laura Mercier translucent
powder in my opinion at least so yeah I
just thought I'd put in the video to
show you guys something different and
then going in with this I believe it's
the Maybelline brow pencil and I'm just
gonna fill them in nothing crazy you
guys see me do this all the time
and then going in with my NYX contour
stick I just like doing a cream contour
before my powder for special events
because it kind of gives a base for the
powder to go on top of so after I apply
that I'm just wiping away the setting
powder and going right in with a powder
bronzer this one is BH Cosmetics it's
affordable it's good it bronzes your
skin I love it
so I'm just warming up the cheeks and
like the temples and making sure you
look nice and tan and bronze and then
for a little bit more color I'm going in
with the shimmer brick by Bobbi Brown in
the shade bronze and I'm just applying
this to my cheeks and then for highlight
I'm gonna damp up my sponge and then set
a little bit of my face with some mist
and then I'm going right in with that
highlight and pressing it right into my
cheeks and on the tip of my nose and
this just makes it seriously look like
you're glowing from within it's so
gorgeous
I'm obsessed and then back in to the
eyes I'm just applying a little bit of
mascara to my lower lash line just to
finish off the look I wanted to do
something a little bit nude so a nice
pencil a nice little cream lip stain I
don't know and then some gloss I'll have
the products linked below so you guys
can see the shade names and stuff but
that's basically it for this look so I
then just set my face and I think you
are ready for prom so guys this is what
the makeup looks like and now let's get
on to the outfit so now on to the
