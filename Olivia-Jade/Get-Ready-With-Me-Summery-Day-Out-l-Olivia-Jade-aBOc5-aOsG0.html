today's video I am sewing kind of like a
summery day out get ready with me I'm
going to show you my hair makeup and
outfit so if you guys want to see how I
get ready then please keep watching I am
in collab with Sephora collection for
this video as you probably know if you
watch my videos like hardcore I worked
with Sephora collection a few times
already and I actually kind of forgot to
mention that I'm their beauty ambassador
for this year we're just so weird and
really exciting to me so I'm going to be
working with them a lot this year you're
going to see a lot of support selection
products or one of my favorite brands
and I think they're super underrated so
with that being said I hope you guys
love this look and let's get started
this is a Sephora collection of beauty
amplifier this is their mattifying
primer but what's super sick about it is
it's jealous it doesn't feel like Matt
obviously I'm just going to take this in
the back of my hand and then apply all
over my face this is also a water-based
primer which is why it feels so light
and refreshing so it's like hydrating
but it like minimizes your pores just
refreshes your skin entirely and what I
actually really love about it if you can
feel how tacky it is so you know that
your makeups gonna last but it's not
that uncomfortable tacky going to go in
with some concealer and using my Too
Faced Born This Way it's been a little
while since I've reached for these
concealers I'm going to start by
applying the lighter shade under my eye
a little bit and then I'm going to go
over it with the more I don't
want like make myself look too pale
there's good I kind of go over
all the spots I want to conceal a little
bit when I use this multitasker face
pushes Vista for a collection 202 and
I'm just going to kind of start by
blending this out all over my face I'm
going in with the more precise side on
stuff it's the concealer size and I'm
just going to like blend in my inner
corner so now for foundation I'm using
my Sephora collection matte perfection
foundation very fun name I'm going to be
using mine in the shade 18 golden linen
so making my Sephora collection 2-0 one
brush it's just a powder and blush brush
and also the foundation and I'm going to
be using the side for powder and I'm
just going to kind of like pop it into
my skin this provides really nice
coverage as well as mask on your face it
has kind of like a creamy consistency
like a creamy texture but it's matte on
the skin after I'm done with that I'm
going to go straight into powder
products I know I'm switching up a
little bit not doing my signature cream
whenever I'm going to take one of my
favorite bronzers this is my Marc Jacobs
and Omega bronzer in one to report
fantastic I'll be taking my 201 brush
again and I'm just going to be using the
blush side of it which is like an angled
brush and I'm going to just kind of warm
up my face and contour a little bit
nothing crazy just giving us a little
bronze
I'm really 11 others make a book turn it
out so after I'm nice and brown going to
add a little color to my cheeks taking
my benefit California blush I love this
blush and it's a little bit newer I'm
just taking it in blush brush size for
questions I'm going to be get moving on
to my eyebrows really quickly I'm taking
this Sephora collection brow pencil it's
waterproof which I love and also this
itty bitty brush is like the cutest
crazy singer ever seen and it works way
better than I thought it would so I just
use this to kind of brush my brows up a
little bit it's so fun I need to get my
brows I'm really valid they're kind of
insane right now I just take this other
side of it and it just filled them in
basically I just twisted a pencil and
I'm applying it all over my brows super
super creamy so it's coming up so
beautifully I'm not pushing super hard
it's really easy to hold and I'm
obsessed with it it just looks really
pretty on the bra as you can see if I'm
doing right now I just finished with my
brows I love this pencil and what's
great about it is it comes in six
different shades so this is she for all
of us I'm in the shade probably help if
I told you I'm in the shade at midnight
ground zero for though that's going to
be using my Sephora collection clear
brow gel I'm just going to set my brows
right now this Bravo is amazing because
it has like these little highlighting
pearls in it is what I was told and
those set your brows in place obviously
but they also kind of give like a
highlighting reflected effect on your
brows which is amazing and I love that
my brows don't feel like they're stuck
down but they're set in place like
they're not crunchy kind of gives like a
medium a whole but it's very flexible I
can't even like I can't even explain it
that was actually magic but you know
what the first try product you actually
blown away about it so that was this
groucho whoa whoa well now I'm going to
go in with my Sephora collection
beauty amplifier setting spray you guys
always know I set my face before I go on
with highlighters and let it's so
refreshing it feels good after I just
spray my face a little bit I'm going to
take my Becca highlighter and champagne
pop seeing that same blush brush and
just a really tiny bit this step is big
man - just putting a little on the tops
of my cheekbones I love how this is a
powder but it also kind of has a really
creamy face and texture so it's gorgeous
I just did you a little bit good move on
to my eyes now I want it if I look to be
really simple and quick and waterproof
so I'm going to be using my Sephora
collection retractable eyeliner it's
waterproof it's a pencil eyeliner it
comes with a smudge and obviously a
puzzle but I'm just going to create a
very thin line um and just kind of
smudge I'll make it nice and smoky and
pretty so as you can see I'm just taking
the eyeliner and just smudging it all
over my eyes it's water resistant bug
resistant smudge resistant it's really
really good at super long laughing it's
not going to move on your eyelids
throughout the day and it's really easy
to apply like it just glides right on as
you're seeing right now so absolutely
love this stuff we're going to take the
other side of the brush and smudge it
out
I just could go in with a really light
layer of mascara I'm using my benefit
they're real I give this back out I'm
going to go in with a bold lip I feel
like I'm always doing a nude lip I
wanted to change it my makeup a little
bit today and now it's so minimal but
it's a different type of minimal so I'm
really stoked on it I want to be taking
my Sephora collection Rouge lip tint in
the shade magenta this is like this
amazing neon pink so what more could
someone possibly ask for
okay this listing right now it's super
silky it's more laughing it feels really
really good on your lips it almost feels
hydrating which is like the craziest
thing I don't know what the formula is
but all I know it covers your lips from
a.m. to p.m. you don't have to reapply
it so much kidding me right this is the
most if you how easy this glides on and
don't open being pranked I don't really
know how to explain this but I think you
need to actually get it when you're
putting it on it kind of feels watery
like water-based but not like runny in a
bad way like so comfortable and
hydrating that if my lips were drying
cracking and falling off my mouth this
would save the day this is the finished
look I hope you guys loved this video
I'm now on to it the hair and custard my
hair is really basic I'm going to show
you how to do that but um it's really
it's really basic I'm going to show you
how I do my hair in place the most basic
easy ahead whoever but I've been kind of
living for it since it's like super
effortless so I'll just take a few our
bands and a hair brush I just kind of
like throw it up it's like super easy
like soap it even K to any effort I like
to brush the back
tiny bit and twist it into a little bun
like so take your time throw it in there
take another hand of time to fill it
really tight take another hair tie since
my hair love to go crazy and what's all
about stuff I just pull out my two
shorter pieces here just like that pull
these baby hairs out like that
I think that I feel like needs a little
help
I just pain so like to know this to
become loose just slightly crunch
sometimes go like so bobbington over so
I want this to come out a little bit
more and I love going down my little
baby hair on the side it just looks
messy and effortless that's my hair okay
