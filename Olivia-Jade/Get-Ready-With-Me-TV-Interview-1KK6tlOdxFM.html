today I'm doing a get ready with me so
if you want to get ready with me for a
very special event than just keep
watching the first thing I'm doing is
priming my face I want my makeup to last
so we're not screwing around I'm priming
with my Laura Mercier foundation primer
and I'm just rubbing that in then I'm
using well I was going to use my L'Oreal
magic lui Lunia
face infused primer but that's just a
dupe for Mac's what's that called strobe
cream which I put on my face in the
video because the L'Oreal one was too
old and the consistency was not working
for me anymore so I have to go pick up a
new one but that's the reason behind
that and then more primer just so I
really know my makeup will not move I'm
using Smashbox photo-finish to just kind
of prime my face and then straight on to
brows my brows are sisters not twins
like ever they're never twins my left
brow is more square than my right brow
so I don't really know what to do about
that but I'm just filling in my brows
where the spots are missing or they're
sparse spots or whatever and I'm using
my honest Razia brow pencil
you
you
you
and then I'm going in with brow gel so
my brows don't move especially after you
spent the time filling them in I'm using
Anasazi brow gel
this step is like glue I absolutely rely
on this and love this I'm then going in
with Mac's Paint Pot in soft ochre and
what I'm doing here is I'm just applying
this all over my eyelid to cancel out
any veins and I'm actually taking a
little bit extra and applying it
straight under my brow bone because in
the later on in the video or when I was
getting ready I decided to highlight my
brow bone but this was just a little
base so the highlight really pops I'm
going in with my basic like pilot from
Naked or Urban Decay and I'm taking that
light brown shade on a big fluffy crease
brush and I'm just blending that in
until you can't really see the color
anymore but your eyes and your crease
and everything has a little bit more
depth
and then taking the dark dark brown and
I'm just messing applying this kind of
to the outer corner and the crease
I just want my eye to have more depth
look kind of more intense and just make
them pop a little bit more so as you can
see this is so messy but the key to
making this clean and look natural and
smoky and fun is just blending so don't
get discouraged if your eyes look like
you've been punched or something
happened just keep blending and
everything will work itself out and then
taking a sigma liner and this is just a
pencil kind of bronzy brown color and
I'm literally messily applying this to
the upper lid or kind of lashline area
keeping it close to the lash line but
don't worry about putting you know it on
your like actual lashes or just being
super precise like it's matte see you're
gonna smudge it out it's just for a
little dimension a little depth and then
just to kind of smoke out your eye and I
love doing brown on brown eyes because
it pops for me so yeah you can just see
what I'm doing
super super messy and then bringing that
on my lower lash line to make it pop
I'm then taking a big crease brush and
blending out that eyeliner you're trying
to make this super super messy because
we're going in with a dark black from
the same basic palette with a really
precise just flat brush and really
putting that on your lash line you don't
want this going above or going into your
crease or even really touching your lid
you want that super super close so it
just makes your lashes look a little bit
like thicker and have more volume I'm
then using my Rimmel perfection match
whatever that's called I'll have all the
products linked down below and just
buffing that into my face I'm speeding
this up so you guys can see it quickly
and you can see the whole thing of me
blending but you're not sitting there
tediously trying to get through it
then going in with my Anasazi a contour
kit I love this stuff I'm using the
shade called banana and this is just a
cream highlight and I'm just applying
this under my eyes to brighten I'm
putting this also around my mouth
because I get discoloration there so the
yellow kind of tones cancels that out
I'm then going in with mac prolongwear
concealer in NC 30 and I'm just applying
that over top the banana shade because
that's is kind of a cream call from a
cream contour kit it's a little bit
stickier than it is liquid so it's a
tiny bit harder to blend by putting this
liquidy concealer over it it's going to
make it super easy to blend out I'm
going in with my Beauty Blender it's
damp make sure it's wet it makes it so
much easier and look a lot more natural
and I'm just kind of tapping rubbing and
as you can see it's blending out really
nicely because of that liquid matte
concealer so by the way I also put the
Mac concealer kind of in my highlighting
points just because I wanted to give
myself a more natural highlight on my
forehead and chin so I didn't use the
banana shade from the cream contour kit
I'm then going in to contour and just
bronze my skin up so I'm using hoola
bronzer by benefit and just a fluffy
tapered brush and I'm lightly contouring
I'm just dipping this in the product and
then kind of sweeping under my cheekbone
and on my cheekbone bringing it more up
than down so I'm contouring and bronzing
and this bronzer is perfect I love this
stuff super easy to use the payment of
the pavement the color payoff is perfect
and yeah it's just great it's just an
easy bronzer to use you'll love it if
you don't have any other bronzers it's
kind of all you really need in your
makeup collection
I'm then setting everywhere we
highlighted with my Mac press powder so
I'm taking that on a crease brush a
clean one of course and just kind of
tapping that and rubbing it where we
highlighted with the banana and the Mac
concealer and then I'm using a Revlon
pressed powder which is the color of my
skin tone and I am just setting my whole
face with that so the foundation and
bronzer and everything doesn't move and
then as I said a little bit earlier I
ended up highlighting the brow bone so
what you're going to want to do is just
highlight with a kind of white shimmery
color and that just makes your brows pop
and then I'm putting a little bit of
mascara on and I will add more later but
I'm just going straight to highlighting
to kind of let that first coat dry and
I'm using the light highlight half of
the Makeup Forever HD sculpting kind of
duo and I'm using the highlight shade
becomes it because it comes with a
highlight and bronzer so yeah I'm just
taking that on a little brush and
highlighting and then going back in with
mascara and coating my lashes for a
final time and by the way I got a little
bit on my lid but I clean that up
outside the video so don't worry just
clean it up yourself and then I'm using
a NYX pencil in natural this is my
favorite shade I was in a little bit of
a rush so I didn't have time to clean my
foundation off my lip so I just put
Kandy K by Kylie cosmetics overtop and
then this was a little bit too pink for
my liking so I ended up going in with
her shade Dolce K and I it's a kind of a
darker pink kind of a brown undertone
and I over talked the Kandy K with that
so that's it for my video thank you guys
all so much for watching I really hope
you enjoyed this look I have to go now
cuz I got something to do but I will see
you guys in my next video bye mwah
