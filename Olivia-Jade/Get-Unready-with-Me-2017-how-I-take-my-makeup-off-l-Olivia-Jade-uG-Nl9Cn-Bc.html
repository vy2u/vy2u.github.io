back to my youtube channel in today's
video I'm doing my drugstore skin
through teen slash get on ready with me
this is so requested and it is partnered
with Neutrogena so thank you guys very
very much
and I hope you guys enjoy so the first
thing I'm doing is my seller water this
one is by beauty 360 I absolutely love
this because when I checked the back of
like ingredients it had all like the
most natural products compared to like
the Garnier one and the other ones so
it's just more beneficial for your skin
honestly along with the one by simple so
those are the two I would recommend I
used to use like Garnier and all those
other ones but I just found that it
didn't work for my skin because it
wasn't the healthiest option so after
I'm done with that I go in with the star
of the show when I boil free acne wash
pink grapefruit foaming scrub it by
Neutrogena I've been using this for
about a year and a half now it's really
really good its oil free it has
salicylic acid acne treatment in it
which is amazing but basically how I
actually discovered this was through my
boyfriend which is kind of funny because
he's usually the one that's like
fighting skincare stuff through me but I
forgot all my face wash at home and
since we live kind of far I was staying
at his house and I needed something to
wash my face obviously so yeah I just
kind of changed my life right then and
there it really got all the dirt down
off my face and made my skin feel really
really clean and just like that pure
feeling so after I am done using that I
just apply it to my face stamp massage
it in and wipe it off see there's
nothing there's no makeup left it's
actually crazy but anyway I then move on
to moisturizer I have to moisturize my
face it is literally like my favorite
thing in the world this one is by
Garnier and it is a gel which i think is
so awesome because it actually cools
your skin down like it feels hydrating
but it's like a cooling sensation I
can't really explain it but I definitely
would recommend it so after I'm done
with that I do a little bit of eye cream
this one is a Neutrogena rapid repair
eye cream I really really like this
because it's so gentle and lightweight
under my eye and it comes in a little
tube which is handy and
a little container so you don't get all
messy but I just have to take care of my
undereyes because I am terrified of
wrinkles um and then I just finish off
with a little bit of aquaphor on my lips
for hydration as you can see this
literally took like two and a half
minutes I'm sorry for the short video
but I just wanted to get to the point um
but yeah it's just a quick skincare
routine so thank you for watching I hope
you guys loved it make sure to subscribe
and I'll see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
