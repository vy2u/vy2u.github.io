youtube channel guess what's happening
daily blog okay I'm saying this now I
don't know how long this is gonna last
workout time I'm gonna put my workout
shoes on and hit the gym I'm just gonna
hit the gym in my house I really don't
want to workout right now
gonna push yourself hey my phone camera
and I'm daily vlogging and he does not
believe me but here we go
I promise I'm telling the truth
now I just have to finish off with a
little walk at four until it hits 34
minutes so you know we have four more
minutes to go
done so this is what it ends and there
you go oh my calves are sore like oh
geez I like doing this little
eight-minute app workout it looks really
like old-fashioned but it's pretty good
I'll link it down below we just did that
well I don't believe in to giving new
moves with some booty exercises yeah
we're like an even if the one minute
I'm sweating that's an accomplishment
because I can like hardly ever sweat
Mondays off to a good start
okay just got out of the shower put this
amazing a bathrobe on I'll link it down
below I believe it's from Pottery Barn I
think it's so soft I'm literally
obsessed of it anyway
just go out of the shower and I'm really
hungry it's 4:45 so I'm gonna go start
to prep dinner usually I get hungry
round this time and it's kind of awkward
because I like I just had lunch but it's
not quite dinner yet so I'm just really
gonna snack on something and then I'll
have dinner after all so the voice is on
tonight and that's my favorite show ever
so hi dad
oh sure I it's pretty dirty huh sure
yeah you madman guys I didn't know if
you're going anywhere like if you'd have
somewhere to go in the next couple days
the next few days nope I probably don't
cuz i watch I'm gonna get some stuff hem
tomorrow maybe just swag good idea okay
Oh Bella what is that
it's what I'm not gonna be every day
because a lot of my days are the exact
same what'd you just say it's hours long
you want to be a blogger guys
she's now denying it but we all heard
her saying that we all heard no why
don't you at school this week I don't
want that oh that was too much fella
brought me to college this week and we
didn't realize how many viewers out
there I felt for you why it was fun I
like meeting viewers I know I just felt
about like you couldn't even walk to sex
for a second girls like truth
I just visit the worst part room does
drunk girls are screaming in your face
that's what I felt like soft shout out
to the drunk girls about traffic video I
loved meeting up guys got about them no
I mean college no it wasn't frustrating
that's totally fine it was overwhelming
but it was cool yeah they threw me Bella
okay so there are some girls screaming
outside you were looking for my friend
okay tell the story we are walking
around one of like the frat houses where
with a friend and you lives in the house
where with his sister - yeah and we're
walking and all of a sudden he walks
like these girls and one of them just
opens their mouth and strains like a
full-on shriek like took Olivia's armed
and I was like nope took her and
actually threw her behind a door and
just like get her there and they're like
eating their head on it Olivia in here
so I obviously couldn't lie because they
just saw me Chuck
basically morale Astoria Bella bulleted
me into a room
she's slingshot at me and I he threw me
in the room and I hit this guy and he's
like whoa I was like I didn't do that
like isn't it I think to save Elise Oh
guys I didn't think I showed you my bag
yet
I bought this room in um I bought myself
booth back for my birthday and it's like
my favorite thing ever
not as much as I love her but I love it
a lot I'm gonna I'm gonna talk to you
guys when I'm doing something rather
interesting dinnertime let's do this
so far I have onion parsley and garlic
and I'm gonna cut it up super super tiny
I'm gonna blend the parsley in the
garlic and in like that thing that makes
it really small and then I'm gonna cut
the onions up and then saute them and
then we're gonna put all together with a
little salt pepper turkey meat and then
put them on the pan
so let's get to okay
are you watching the skin of an onion
nailed it I just ate some dinner with my
dad if you guys are wondering where my
mom is she is working so that's why
she's not home I always get questions
like are your parents all together I
never see both of them like in the same
vlog and it's just cuz either am i
working or whatever but yes they're very
much together let's start editing a
little bit of this footage just because
obviously I'm new to the daily vlogging
thing and just to like talk about it I
don't know if I'm gonna be daily
vlogging like every single day I know
that's what daily volume means but
because I'm in school and sometimes I
just come home and do homework and
literally do nothing those are not fun
to watch at all so I'm really gonna vlog
when I'm doing stuff when something's
fun maybe I'll combine clips from a few
days I'm not gonna put too much pressure
on myself to vlog every single day
obviously I'm just gonna do it what I
want and like have fun with it but I'm
gonna try for a week to do everyday and
we'll see what happens but no stress
it's kind of like a tester out or like
every day every other day kind of
situation that's so yeah that's what's
up right now hey guys absolutely we're
just catching up I just announced her
I'm a daily vlogger now so thanks man

way shape or form because that knows a
bunch of question we're gonna come my
way so I just have to put that out there
super cute though
any place water polo so all my girls
subscribers or guys subscribers even
though calories not really into the hot

pressed juice fries it's like misleading
that we pull out say so we're gonna get
some we're gonna get some ice cream or
it's not ice cream it's like a healthy
ice cream it's bullshit it tastes really
good though so backpack wastes so much
