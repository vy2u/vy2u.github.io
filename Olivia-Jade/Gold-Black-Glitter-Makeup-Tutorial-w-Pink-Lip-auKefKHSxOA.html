my channel today I filmed a makeup
tutorial on this look that I'm wearing
right now so if you guys do want to see
how to get this look then just keep
watching and also I think that's Milan
ops but so if you guys do want to see
you how you get this look then just keep
watching first I'm gonna start with a
primer and I'm starting with the L'Oreal
Paris magic lumi light infusing primer
and this is supposed to brighten up your
face and anytime I put it on it makes my
face really red so that's cool after
primer I'm using a foundation and I'm
using at my favorite drugstore one which
is the L'Oreal True Match Lumi I have
tried so many other drugstore
foundations but I just I can't go any
other way I'm going to be applying this
with my BH Cosmetics foundation brush in
the party set collection I know the
colors are super cool like pump on the
back of my hand and also what I like
about this foundation is it super
buildable I'm starting at my cheeks
and chain and I really should've gotten
a different brush you know what this
brush isn't doing me justice I'll be
right back so I'm gonna use this BH
Cosmetics flat top kabuki brush and then
I'm just gonna buff that into my face I
switch brushes because I was unhappy
with the other one at first its struggle
so after you're done buffing at Anna
I'm gonna go in with my Maybelline
instant age rewind concealer in the
color neutralizer this is also a heavier
look kind of a night out look and if
you're not comfortable with running this
much makeup don't worry about it I'm not
really comfortable wearing this much
makeup outside now see they're gonna put
this in triangles under our eyes and on
our chin highlighting the high points of
our face um as my friend happy likes to
tell me I'm wearing seventeen because
it's the foundation and I'm just buffing
out in with the same brush
and then I'm just gonna take my fingers
and go in on the inner corner and my
eyelid and just blend that out as best
you can
going back to my party set with this
powder brush I'm going to take my Rimmel
stay matte powder and set my foundation
and concealer and I'm also gonna set my
eyes what's going to come back to the
rest of the face later but I think I'll
just finish it up and then go right
right or should we go to eye and then do
the face afterwards decisions decisions
decisions
mmm I think we'll finish the face cup we
don't got much to do I'm going to be
going in with a blush but this is kind
of a it's called a master glaze and
basically it's in this stick it's a
highlighting blush by Maybelline and it
has a lot of Sheen and shimmer in it
with these kinds of blushes I like to go
in on a brush first and then apply it to
the face straight to the face is way too
much and I don't really like the look of
that and I suggest you try that if
you've tried one of these types of
products before and haven't liked it
because a brush makes a very big
difference I usually like applying this
with a stipple brush but since it's them
about that when I'm too lazy to get it
this is working right okay now moving on
to the eyes the face is super easy and
simple so we are gonna do something on
the eyes I haven't decided yet so we are
going to move on to the eyes and I don't
really have anything in mind and I'm
using this Sonia Kashuk palette which is
I don't know made and then we are going
to also be using this I haven't decided
yet but we're also gonna be using one of
these
I'm so professional out of these lore'l
pallets because for a little bit of
shimmer in the inner corner I'm gonna
start with this little blending what
would you call this precision brush and
I'm going to be taking this color right
there and just popping that in the
crease this is going to be used as our
transition shade
I'm going to take this fluffy kind of
angled crease brush and I'm going to be
putting it in this dark brown and we're
going to be running that
so after you apply those two colors into
your crease we're gonna start by taking
this color right here and applying it
all over the lid
I'm going to take this black blacks are
hard to work with they're hard to blend
I literally dabbed it once and on this
glass here I'm blending it out that is
really unsanitary I'll blend it out of
my hand
kind of in a v-shape
okay now I'm just gonna take that big
brush that we originally we're blending
out with and I'm gonna go back in with
that tan shade okay wait did I ever go
in without straining it maybe not I'm
gonna go with the first color I don't
remember what we use I'm just going with
the flow and I'm just blending that out
in the crease as the transition also I'd
like to say I'm no makeup artist nor
think I'm a makeup artist I'm just
trying to teach it what I'm doing here
so yeah I was gonna do kind of a kind of
a lighter color in the inner corner but
I think I may stop here okay should I
stop no let's keep going why would I
stop when we're just getting started
I'm going in with this L'Oreal palette
and I'm gonna go in with that gold I'm
just gonna put that on it's so much
energy you're gonna put this nice gold
it kind of reminds me of half-baked from
The Naked palette putting that on this
little tiny precision brush can you do
that it's microscopic I'm glad I kept
going it's kind of interesting
we really hope you guys can see this
and then kind of stopping at the outer
corner where we mostly have the black
shade so I'm gonna go in with this
L'Oreal palette in yeah these don't have
names on Oh
perpetual nude I'm gonna take this
purplish color here because I think
that's gonna blend out the gold from
just going straight to black we're gonna
take that on the same little precision
brush we're putting that right in
between where we left that little gap
there my fingers caught in the mirror
OOP got it and then we're coming to a 90
folks we're gonna take that big blending
brush that we use that angled kind of
crease brush I'm gonna take the lightest
shade up here not the lightest it goes
white then this shade and then the shape
we're gonna take the shape you haven't
used it yet put our brush in there we're
gonna blend out the crease
we are gonna take that white that really
bright white and put that as a brow
highlight so now we're gonna go in with
an eyeliner this is Physicians Formula
I'm not sure if this is drugstores this
is about ten dollars but it reminds me a
lot of the Stila which is twenty dollars
I start in the middle right here and I
just drag it out all the way to the end
and then I go with my pen I always hold
it sideways I go from the inner corner I
sweep out so I go inner corner keep
drawing it out
after you're done with the eyeliner
you're gonna go in with the mascara and
I'm using an oldie but a goodie a baleen
rocket mascara in the darkest color
which is just black but anyway I'm
finishing off with just a light pink lip
and I using the Revlon cream stick in
the shade pink in the afternoon of for15
okay I do not know
I'm going to add two glosses from elf on
top the first one in sweet salmon
so hopefully this kind of lightens it
and the next one in ballet slippers
which is a bit of a lighter kind of nude
pink
oh and brows we gotta do brows I'm gonna
take the Sonia Kashuk palette and I'm
going to tape I'm gonna take this shade
right there and you just put it on an
angled brush and go through your house
and fill in the areas that need filling
so yeah thank you guys all so much for
