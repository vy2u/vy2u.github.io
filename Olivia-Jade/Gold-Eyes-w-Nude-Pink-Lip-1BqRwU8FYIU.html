channel today I'm doing a makeup
tutorial it's kind of a goldish purple
on the eye and then a nude lip so stay
tuned
first I am applying a babe can I talk a
primer it's baby skin by Maybelline and
I'm just putting this in my t-zone
because that's where I get the most oily
and that's where my makeup and
foundation and concealer will slip right
off my face which we don't want to
happen so I'm using my Giorgio Armani
foundation and just a sigma brush all
the products and everything will be
linked down below in the down bar but I
like this foundation I think it's really
nice it's super expensive that's
probably the main reason why I use it so
much and it's a little light for my
color right now because I'm more tanned
because the summer I mean I'm not that
Dan but more tan than this foundation
but I I like it but I not a huge fan of
it I mean I like my Maybelline one
better so I don't know what all the hype
is I'm using my Maybelline fit me
concealer and my Sedona lace two one
seven brush or maybe it's a two seven
seven brush I'll link it down below and
I'm just blending this out I heard about
this brush from Kathleen lights and her
channel and oh my gosh it's amazing I
love this brush I'm then taking my
makeup forever powder and now HD bronzer
and highlight yeah that's it and I'm
blending that together with my brush and
then applying it on my cheeks and my
forehead and down my chin and everything
like that because I like how it looks
like a natural glow and then using the
morphe 35 t palette and I'm taking that
first shade and blending it into my
crease I'm only using this palette for
the whole eye look so and it's pretty
affordable and I think it's on sale
right now have the link down below and
then I'm taking that second shade right
down below and I'm just blowing that
into the crease
once again guys this palette is actually
amazing like I've never tried a better
palette and then I'm taking that dark
brown in the corner right there and I am
blending that into the crease as well
this look is all about building the
crease up and then doing one lid shade
so it's super easy especially for
beginners I'm taking that gold shade and
just plopping that on oh I hate that
word I feel like everyone the whole
voiceover by doing that I'm so sorry I'm
putting that away
I like actually hate that word uh anyway
I'm applying this on the lid I'm really
mad I said that and then I'm taking that
first shade again and blending that out
back into the crease and then um yeah I
took the first shade to buy the crease
by the way I think I just said that and
then I'm taking that gold once again the
same one we used on the lid and I'm just
taking a sigma short shader brush I
think and I'm just applying this on the
lower lash line that is definitely not a
short shader brush I don't even know
what that is then I'm taking a Sigma
Brown eyeliner and I'm just applying
that on the lower lash line which I
really like I'm then taking this all my
brow pomade
it's alright I'm sorry I'm yawning it's
8 a.m. I don't know why I'm up um anyway
it's alright it's not the best thing
I've ever used but it got me through the
brow process my eyebrows are naturally
pretty thick so I didn't need anything
crazy I'm then using this Rimmel lash
accelerator mascara which as you can see
I just said that so good so yeah that's
pretty good and then I'm going to be
applying false lashes so be right back
and then I'm back and I'm just applying
some liquid black eyeliner to cover up
the glue and just make the lashes look a
little more natural I'm using it in um I
was going to say a shade but it's black
I don't know what I was gonna say anyway
I'm just applying that and then I am
using the lash accelerator again which I
did not love for my bottom lashes it
made them a little gross looking and
then I'm using Too Faced lipstick and
that's it thanks so much for watching
and I will see you guys in my next one
bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
