I don't know why I say it's Olivia
Jade's like obviously it's Olivia anyway
welcome back to my youtube channel if
you're new here you should subscribe
today I was feeling it very inspired by
Hailee Steinfeld makeup for the Grammys
yes it was the Grammys she had this
amazing gorgeous blue smokey eye and
this bronzy glowy skin with this nude
lip and I just really wanted to recreate
it and her outfit was incredible as well
so this is what her makeup look look
like I'll have a picture right here so
you guys can see an up close shot of her
eyes and her lips and her skin and what
not but I just did my version of that
today I think she absolutely killed the
look and looked gorgeous so if you guys
want to see how to get the look or my
version of the look then just keep
watching and I hope you enjoy so the
first thing I'm doing for my eyes is
just applying a little bit of concealer
this is just to prime them so we're just
blending this out and then I'm just
gonna set that with a little bit of
powder so as you can see one of my eyes
is clearly already done this is just to
save time and I wanted to practice and
make sure I liked the look so I'm gonna
be using two pallets first of all the
Too Faced his puppy palette oh it's
called clover I think that's Jeremy's
dog's name
Jerrod and Jeremy's dog I think so the
first thing I'm gonna do is just mix the
shade Chihuahua and fur baby which are
those two neutral Browns and I'm just
gonna blend this really lightly into my
crease these two shades are like the
only two shades were using before we dip
into it the fun stuff so in that same
palette Fair is this amazing shade
called spoiled and I thought that this
is literally what I have all over my eye
I'm not kidding and I thought this just
worked so well so the reason I'm doing
my eyes before my foundation is because
I did
to clean up this a little bit with a
makeup remover wife which is totally
fine and I think it would have looked
horrible if I didn't do that
so yeah just if you're gonna recreate
this look I would start with the eyes
but I'm just taking that really gorgeous
shimmer blue shade and I'm just going to
start by literally applying this in the
crease and then just working downwards
and as you can tell it already just
gives like such a pretty effect I switch
between a blending like a fluffy one and
then a flat shader and then with the
flat shader I just kind of like work
this on the lid I'm not being too
precise or careful I'm just trying to
have fun with it you know so I just kind
of apply that all over the lid and you
can see in the picture in her crease she
has shimmer in there so that's why I'm
blending the same colors on the lid and
the crease I'm going to go back in with
that neutral brush I'm just kind of like
a diffuse that a tiny bit or this I what
I did just to give it a little bit of
dimension is I went in with this BH
Cosmetics oil eyes 228 color eyeshadow
palette and I kind of just went in the
bottom like two darker blue shades right
there and I did like the smallest
itty-bitty amount on kind of like the
outer corner of the eye so I'm just
gonna dip back into those and this is
literally just going like right there
and in the crease just for like a tiny
bit of definition and then I kind of
also drag this under a tiny bit so then
I'm going back in with this palette and
that blue shade on the flat shader brush
which is called spoiled and I am just
putting this all under my lower lash
line this always gets tricky to get okay
tomorrow there we go
and really with this part here I try and
connect this together because in her is
it like was super seamless so I just
connect that together and then I'm
bringing this like as close in as it's
gonna get
I just take a makeup line like this and
I basically just kind of fold it like
this and then I did okay so after that
literally this is basically the eye look
I think it is so simple and beautiful so
I'm just taking a black smudge kind of
Kohl eyeliner this one is the Maybelline
lasting drama waterproof gel pencil I'm
just gonna apply this in my waterline
and I'm just I'm not bringing it all the
way in I'm just gonna kind of bring it
like a little bit you know so as I was
saying after I clean that up
I'm just gonna take a little bit of this
eyeliner and really lightly apply this
to the waterline just like that and I
just kind of take a little bit more of
that blue shade in the crease and on the
lid a little bit just to kind of like
intensify one last time darling and
after I'm done with all that jazz I am
going to apply the lashes so I'm using
the Ardell whispies and I literally cut
off the edge by like two lashes like
literally nothing crazy so I'm gonna
apply these right now and then I'll be
right so I just went ahead and popped on
those lashes and then added a little bit
of mascara to my lower lashes as well
because I saw on her look they were very
long and to finish off my eye makeup I'm
taking a little bit of my Oprah
highlighter in the shade ever glow and
I'm just taking the white portion of the
highlight and popping it on in a corner
so I was practicing with a whole bunch
of different inner corner highlights on
this eye and I found this one just gave
the most similar vibe because the other
ones I was trying were like a little bit
too like harsh and this one kind of has
like a really subtle glow so I just kind
of like
not in like that so now I'm gonna zoom
you guys out and let's fix my crazy face
that looks crazy wearing a shirt just so
everyone knows so let's do the face
makeup the first thing I'm going to
start with is primer and this is my
hourglass veil mineral primer I was
honestly hoping this would be a little
bit more like hydrating but it's like
anyway with her makeup I noticed that
it's like very glowy and she doesn't
really have much color to her face it's
like very flawless airbrush and then a
little bit bronzy so it really looks
like she's glowing from within no joke
so I'm gonna take a little bit of Mac
strobe cream and kind of just apply this
all over my skin starting on the area's
I kinda want to highlight like the
cheeks nose area I'm just gonna drag it
everywhere else just so I get that like
really nice glow so I'm gonna take my
neat foundation this is the Clinique
beyond perfecting foundation A+
concealer I literally love this stuff it
actually makes you look so airbrushed
and gorgeous I am just obsessed with it
at this point I'm very pale right now so
I think this should match it's the shape
to and then I'm just going to take a
kabuki brush and blend this into my skin
I feel like this makes it look so
flawless also the foundation kind of
oxidizes and then like turns to your
color which is cool so if it's a little
off just watch a little bit careful
around the eyes I'm too lazy to get up
and want my duty blender but just to
take away something like streak marks I
sprayed a little bit on my sponge so now
to frighten and highlight I'm taking my
chart shape tape I'm really going for
this and it's just brightening up the
areas she looks like there's a lot of
light in like this part of her face
taking a little bit of powder and I'm
just gonna be setting my under eyes and
I'm just gonna set kind of around where
I highlighted just to keep those areas
nice and bright
20 minutes lay down um okay so this has
been on my face for far too long so I'm
going to brush it off just lightly so
after that I am going to go in with a
cream bronzer but before I just want to
kind of spray my face a little bit and
then I'm just gonna take a little bit of
this in con toy so she had like the most
beautiful bronze cheeks I've literally
ever seen so I think I'm just gonna do
cream bronzer and then a powder
highlight because I feel like it I'm
gonna go in with my highlighter I'm
gonna take this over one and I'm not
gonna just use the white shade I'm gonna
mix all three for the cheeks but for the
tip of the nose I'm just gonna take the
white part and cuz that's what hers look
like literally like this so cute how
cute our little button nose highlights I
love them I'm gonna take this little
brush here I'm just kind of like going
in so bright I love that a little bit
I'm gonna spray my face I have a shirt
on by the way I think I said that
already but and then I'm gonna go in
with my brows and she has like the most
amazing
full brows ever I'm not gonna do really
anything except just fill in this edge
right here if you don't know I am
missing part of my brow right there
don't know why or how and then since her
brows are so amazing and big and
beautiful they like kind of almost just
like stick up like they're not like
uniform at all they're just like super
fluffy so that's what I'm gonna do for
the final part I'm gonna do the lip
first thing I'm gonna do is take this
way long-wear
lipliner and I'm just gonna kind of over
draw my lips because I have little ish
lips but once I get some lip liner on
them I can make them pretty decent-sized
I'm only kind of filling them like
halfway this was in the shade nude okay
simple enough and then I'm going in with
this Maybelline Baby Lips color bomb and
this is in the shade toasted taupe its
0-5 she kind of had like her lip
finished it was kind of like a bomb it
was like kind of shiny but not glossy
and it wasn't not at all so I think this
is kind of perfect I'm gonna just add a
little bit of this color in there and
then of course one last time I need to
spray my face and that's a look so guys
