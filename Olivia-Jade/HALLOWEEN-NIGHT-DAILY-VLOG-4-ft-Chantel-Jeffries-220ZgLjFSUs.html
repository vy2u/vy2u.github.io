store um everyday clothing Wow
I literally get the most random stuff
but all I like to shop online because
they give you a better well don't have
been very green yeah because like when
you're out of the mall you go somewhere
and you see one thing and then you go to
another so and you see like a better
version of that one thing I honestly
really like Nordstrom I really like
online I can find really good stuff for
like forever 21 and I do that a lot for
videos as you guys know so yeah I
definitely think online
yeah just anywhere online is so much
easier yeah Qwest restful either forever

dolls kill how long have you guys known
each other
you never know what was your dream job
when you were kids I think mine was a
vegetarian I think that's a lot of good
yeah my dream job was to be a
dermatologist or like a plastic surgeon
because I'm just so interested in
there's these TV shows doctor Dinah - no
thanks the watch my god I was so
interested in that I really liked
science and stuff but I'm also really
into skincare so I always loved like
popping feels pit bulls and like yeah

powder bronzer and I'm doing a little
contour with it - in and out or

chick-fil-a was my favorite spot before
I became vegetarian which is like five
months ago um but I used to love me some
chick-fil-a and I always wanted it on
Sundays and it was always close
