I'm throwing out with a bare face right
now but as we kind of get into this
video you're going to see me laughing on
a lot of products specifically Korean
products because as you can tell by the
title of this video I am doing a
highlighting and contouring kind of
tutorial this is super requested I get
this on Twitter all the time so a month
or two ago I made a big poll of
different videos and this was in the
poll and this was the most voted video
so I think people want to see this I
hope you guys enjoy it just before we
kind of get into it I just want to
announce that this is not something that
I would do every day or I would
recommend doing every day like putting
on this much makeup will cause breakouts
and acne and I mean if you feel like
this is necessary for your everyday
routine then you do you if you want to
do that then go ahead I'm just saying in
personal experience with dealing with
skin and all that as you can tell for
the most part my skin is pretty clear at
the moment so I think it's just because
I've cut back on a lot of foundation and
all that so anyway um yeah let's go
ahead and get started and I really hope
you guys enjoy this tutorial okay so to
start out if you're going to be using
all these products especially cream
contours it's really really great to use
a cream primer or just a cream base or
something so that when you're dealing
with like your I feel like I just said
cream so many times I'm actually going
to use my L'Oreal magic Lumi primer this
is so great and this is pretty much the
exact same thing as Mac strobe cream so
these are basically identical if you
don't want to spend the pretty penny on
the Mac the L'Oreal is amazing it just
gives you a really shiny look um so this
might be a little um shinier than Mac's
strobe cream but it gives you like the
most glowy beautiful thing ever I love
it so much this I might like this more
than Mac strobe cream actually because I
think it's amazing I'm going to try and
show you guys for this video high-end
products if I'm using them a really good
dupe for drugstore um
so for example I'm going to be using my
high-end Chanel foundation this is the
Chanel aqua foundation and this is
basically the only foundation I've been
using because it's the perfect match for
my skin but otherwise a really great
option is the Rimmel match perfection I
don't think it's this like toned right
now
I don't think this is my shade I'm just
going to start by a pine nut in the
center of my face and then blending
outward I like to dab it I suggest using
a Beauty Blender just because or a damp
one oh and as I said I'm showing you
dupes so this is my Real Techniques
sponge I'm just not using it because
it's a little dirty dirtier than my
Beauty Blender so I just went with the
cleaner option but this is basically the
exact same thing as my Beauty Blender
this one just has a flat side and then a
pointed side and this is way cheaper
it's by Real Techniques this is Beauty
Blender which you can get at Sephora um
so yeah after you kind of just dab that
in you're good to go you have a good
base and now it's time to conceal and
highlight and contour and you know all
the fun stuff so for this video I'm
going to be using my honest Razia cream
contour kit I'm gonna have a picture
right here which is a contour kit by NYX
I don't actually have this I'm going to
pick it up tomorrow I think I'm just
going to make a stop at Ulta but yeah
basically it's a cream contour kit they
all work the same some are better than
others but that makes one I've heard
really great things about and I did
research and reviews and to make sure
I'm not suggesting something crappy so I
think you guys should be good to go and
if you have a foundation that's too dark
for you I also recommend using just a
foundation that's way too dark so as you
can see this is way darker than my
natural skin tone so if I didn't have
this which I picked up today actually I
would be using a darker foundation what
I'm going to do is I'm just going to
start by highlighting so I'm going to
start with the middle shade which is
that banana yellow shade and what you're
going to do with that is I'm going to
take that on a concealer brush and
taking my concealer and I'm just
um I'm taking my brush and the concealer
and then I'm just putting a really
little bit under my eyes like that this
isn't going to be the only concealer we
use so that's why I'm keeping it really
light and I'm not heavily packing it on
I'm just taking a couple swipes and then
just forming it in a triangle to
highlight and conceal so as you can tell
that's super light but that's kind of
the main goal with highlighting um you
want to really brighten up this kind of
center of your face and then contour and
bronze the outside um by the way I'm not
doing anything like I think I'm a
professional or I know what I'm talking
about I literally just learned from
YouTube so I just kind of want to share
with you what works for me you know and
then we're going to also take that
yellow concealer and just put it at the
tip of our chin just to brighten that up
and this part of our forehead you want
to just kind of brighten this all up and
I don't I've never tried this concealer
kind of thing out so we're going to see
how this blends but I really have no
idea for the contour part you're going
to I'm going to contour our actually
cheekbones but I'm also going to bronze
with this so I'm going to use this first
shade here just because it's the
lightest so I think will look the most
natural and I'm just taking my Sigma
large fluff brush honestly whatever
little brush you want to use I don't
think a brush really makes a difference
for this part but I'm just kind of
placing it where I would contour where
my cheeks are and instead of dragging
down you kind of want to drag the excess
up I'm shaking that first Brown again
and sculpting out our forehead if you
have a large forehead this will make it
look smaller and if you have a tiny
forehead you probably don't have to
contour your forehead at all I have a
tiny ish forehead but I'm doing it for
the sake of the video and then also jaw
line you just kind of want to lightly
swipe where you want your jaw to look
sharp going back in with that concealer
I'm just taking a foundation brush and
kind of cleaning right up under here
because you want that to stay
right right there so I did a really
light amount that I just kind of messed
it threw it on there I'm blabbering so
much in this video but I'm just trying
to talk through it anyway I'm just
taking my damp Beauty Blender and just
tapping this out for right now what a
lot of people like to do also is take
their foundation a little bit more and
blend it out but I'm just going to see
how this works out for us um because I
don't want to pile more foundation on I
don't have to that concealer blended out
really beautifully I really love that
that's called banana in the cream
contour kit by uh Nastasia and I don't
know if we're going to need to end up
using more concealer we have to figure
it out oh my god pause we forgot to do
the nose what you're going to want to do
is if you want to make your nose appear
slimmer you're going to make your
contour lines closer in if you want to
make your nose appear farther apart you
to make your contour lines farther out
I'm going to start with highlighting
though so you're just going to bring
this right down the bridge of your nose
anyway you guys are just gonna have to
ignore the vacuum noise in the back
because I got to keep filming and I
can't do anything about I'm just taking
the same first shade we used in the
beginning on that precision brush and
just loading up the tip of your brush
with that and then I just like to make
an even contour right down the two sides
so I just kind of start you don't wanna
you want to start sorry I kinda wanna
focus but you kind of want to start up
at top here you know and then just
evenly kind of make a line my lines not
perfect I just kind of like to blend
down I don't really know how to get that
perfect straight line to be honest
but I'm just going to start with my
Beauty Blender and just tap it in and
I'm just going to mute this because this
vacuum is annoying and you guys get it
you can just watch what I'm doing
I just finished blending out my contour
and highlight I think this actually
looks really good I basically just use
this shade and the shade which is banana
the highlight and then cinnamon as the
bronzer in the cream contour kit by
anastasiya I'm going to take a fluffy
crease brush and just use it to set the
concealer so I'm taking that tapping off
the excess and then just setting where
we highlighted under our eyes just to
mattify it um yeah I think this looks
really nice I'm going to set the chin
set the bridge of the nose set that
forehead
I don't know around the mouth and kind
of right around here right under the
contour not the contour part I'm gonna
set the bronzer with uh an actual
bronzer I'm going to set it with my Make
Up For Ever HD Pro sculpting a palette I
haven't seen this on YouTube in a while
so I thought it'd be fun to just switch
it up and use it responding that and I'm
I'm adding more product just to make it
a little more intense but where you're
going to blend it out after and this is
just to make sure the bronzer it doesn't
move and it stays the color because once
you blend out some stuff you don't want
to lose pigmentation of the bronzer just
what I like to do to finish it all is
I'm just going to take a little
highlight I'm using Mac's lightscapade
this is a really light highlight I'm
using this on a big tapered brush and
what I'm doing is I'm just kind of
feathering it on and then just lightly
like hardly touching my face going like
this
and just kind of this center point this
part is super unnecessary but just for a
little sheen why not so that's it for my
contour and highlight tutorial I hope
you guys all enjoyed it and I hope you
found this helpful
um yeah this was really fun to film and
I'm really happy with the way it turned
out so if you guys decide to use this
routine or if you guys want to suggest
for people down below good dupes for
this palette or you know any of the
stuff that I chose to use on my face
then please help some friends out down
there and you know do that but yeah all
the products I use will be linked down
below per usual and I will see you guys
in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
