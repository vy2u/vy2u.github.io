do my requested beginners contour
highlight video I just want to say that
all the products used are high-end in
this video but I'm going to leave direct
dupes down below so those of you that
are beginners and don't want to splurge
on really expensive makeup I will have
basically the same thing for way cheaper
in the description box so to start out
when you're highlighting and contouring
I already have a foundation shade that
matches me and then I'm going in with a
concealer a couple shades lighter than
my skin tone and I'm placing it in five
spots so starting out underneath my eyes
I'm doing them in backwards triangles
because this highlights your under eyes
I'm doing it on the tip of my nose and
just kind of down the center the center
of my forehead and my chin so these are
the places where you want to kind of
light up which is the center of your
face and then we're going to contour the
perimeter so to blend this out I'm
taking a damp Beauty Blender and I'm
just pressing this in to my skin this
makes such a big difference
getting a wet sponge will blend out your
product so much more flawlessly and
beautifully so I seriously recommend it
it doesn't have to be a Beauty Blender
just anything works and I'm just
pressing this into my skin so it's not
absorbing the product it's kind of
pushing it on then taking a translucent
powder I know a cheaper one is on Amazon
I believe it's called airspun but what
I'm doing with this is taking my sponge
and packing this under my eyes where we
highlighted and the reason for this is
because we want to keep it bright while
we're contouring and bronzing our skin
so next up we are going to contour it
I'm using the Clinique chubby stick
contour stick I just have a great
contour stick from NYX I'll link it down
below it's such a good dupe but I am
just placing this on the outer like
portion of my face and anywhere where
you want a little bit more definition so
placing it under a chin there will give
us a sharper jawline our cheekbones our
forehead and then if you want you can
contour your nose
I don't ever do this but I thought I'd
show you how anyway
and then to blend this out I'm taking a
damp beauty blender once again and just
pressing this into my skin making sure
that it blends out nice and flawlessly
and ah yeah this is just the easiest way
to do it in my opinion you can use a duo
fiber brush I've seen a lot of people do
that and it also looked beautiful but I
love just sticking to my Beauty Blender
and just pressing this in and blending
it out it is really quite easy and you
don't again need really high-end
products to do this and I said it's just
all I had upstairs with me and yeah so I
believe dupes down below for you guys
because I really don't want to think you
need all these to accomplish a glowy
skin like the glowy look I can't speak
anyway I'm gonna take a brush and wipe
away the powder we let's it under under
eyes and after I'm done with that I'm
going to take this contour palette this
is from Kat Von D but NYX has a really
similar one I'm taking two bronze shades
and just placing this where I've used
that cream contour stick so I'm just
basically setting the cream contour
stick with this powder it also will just
make it a little bit more defined I'll
go be more color to it it's just kind of
a good step if you just want to kind of
take it to the next level so I'm just
placing that all over the places where I
cream contoured and blending it out
making sure that it looks like we just
got kissed by the Sun and nothing too
crazy and then I'm going to spray a
little bit of some primer water but
whatever you have even just like spray
water works this is just so when I take
this cream highlight it really glows so
I'm just putting this on my damp you
blender it directly placing it on the
tops of my cheekbones wherever I want to
highlight I'm going to speed up this
process but you guys can see what I'm
doing I'm just placing this everywhere
where I want a little bit more glow and
then pressing it into my skin I am not
sure what really good dupes are out
there for this exact product but I'm
sure
so many easy whatever little cream
highlighters from the drugstore so I
will definitely do my research and then
link them down below as for all the
other products but I'm just placing this
on my Cupid's bow the tip of my nose the
tip of like my forehead area and then my
cheekbones because this will make you
glow and then setting that again with
this powder this is a Mac like
illuminating powder I believe it's in a
beaming blush and it is stunning I just
started using this and I'm literally
obsessed it's so gorgeous but once again
I will try and find it something very
similar it down below I'm just placing
this in the spots I put that cream
highlight and then finishing off by
setting my whole entire face and that is
all I'm doing though so thanks so much
for watching I hope you guys found this
easy and helpful I love you and I'll see
you guys next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
