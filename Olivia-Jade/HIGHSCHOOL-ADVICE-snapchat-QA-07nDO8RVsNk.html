time no see I haven't posted in a little
while
I've been posted in about two weeks I've
been m.i.a I am so so so so so so so so
so so so sorry about that it was
actually on vacation in Nantucket which
literally fell in love Nantucket is the
most incredible place I've ever been in
my whole entire life I didn't really do
many back to school videos so I'm going
to try and cram a few in maybe for
entertainment for some of you've already
started school and I'm not even being
helpful
or for those you who are going back in
September this could help you a little
bit so this one whether you're in school
now because you're probably pretty
you're not like deep into school you
probably just started or for those who
are going back today I'm doing a Q&amp;amp;A
snapchat Q&amp;amp;A like I've done before you
guys send me in videos on snapchat and I
show myself answering them I love this
it's so much more personal so let's jump
right into it it's all about high school
questions and if you guys didn't ask
high school one then let's see what you
asked I am I was wondering what your
favorite back-to-school shop is like
store to buy your back school clothes
and yeah my River back to school
probably like forever21 brandy melville
hmmm
math decal those kind of stuff because
it's forever 21 H&amp;amp;M and brandy melville
Kai rate level is more on the cheaper
side and first school you don't want to
buy super nice stuff and roll up and
that just like be casual and cute so
something cheap but stylish and very in
fashion what's it like when people come
you and they're like I love you like
you're awesome like I know you for me
too
oh my gosh you're so cute and so this
one is an highschool question but I'm
going to answer it anyway you're
adorable
um it's the best and weirdest feeling
because I don't think I'm famous or
anything so like it definitely every
time it catches me off guard when I was
actually in Nantucket um some British
kids came up to me and I was in the
Tucket on a beach and they're from a
whole different Concord for me so when
they come up to me like can we take a
picture I love your channel whatever I
was so thrown off like just like what
what's happening so it's an amazing
amazing feeling
um I can't even describe it it gets me
so excited like I get like emotional
talking about it and literally I get
emotional I'm it's just so so cool and
I'm like so grateful for all you guys
cuz like I didn't really do any I don't
I don't know it's amazing I'm it's um
it's one of the best feelings so if you
ever see me please please say hi to me
and you don't even know how much it
makes my day I am the type of person if
having like the biggest rush but
somebody still comes up and says hide me
like um like makes of my life it's so
awesome what's little works great you
ever gotten a test under your parents
care if you don't do those tests love
you love you to start my friend Rockies
texted me
um the words great I ever got what is
she saying this girl
borås great I've ever gone in on a test
I've never gotten an F okay I think got
like a D before don't think I've know I
know I've gotten a D before fifty-
hasn't been f but it hasn't been like
the people that always get like B's and
above I'm like perhaps to you honestly
like you do you because you are working
hard and that's what I really didn't
study and I just was like whatever I
don't need school which is dumb and now
I work really hard and my grades are
really good now but or I haven't started
but last year this was like a little
while ago but
my parents they don't care if I get a
bad grade if they know I've worked
really hard and give it like giving it
all my effort but if they know I just
slacked and fell behind then they're
going to be a little upset probably a
little consequence like you're not going
out this weekend or give me your phone
or something like that but that's only
if they know that I really didn't try
like if they know I give it my own
they've seen me studying and they see me
working with tutors and stuff like that
they're like okay well what do we do to
like improve on it and like what did you
miss you know you are procrastinators
and if you are happy motivate yourself
to do your projects love you too sorry
the beginning of her cut off I put my
volume down for some reason I am such a
procrastinator but in high school you
don't have time to procrastinate you
literally need to do your work because
it catches up on you time management is
the most important thing in high school
so I am a procrastinator but I've gotten
a lot better I kind of just want to get
home do my work get it out of the way
it's so bad when you've procrastinated
and then at 8:00 at night you have all
this homework to do because you need the
time from when you're home from school
then going to bed to really just plan
out what your schedule looks like how
much work you've got what you got to do
that kind stuff is your favorite my
favorite food to eat in the summer is
watermelon I love watermelon my name is
Olivia and I am finding some tips on how
to make new friends I'm going to school
love you love you too Olivia and some
tips for making new friends is being
yourself obviously you don't want to go
into a crowd and try to fit in with
somebody that you're just just trying to
fit in with um with high school and with
school there's so many people there and
there's so many different groups of
people that are interested in different
things that you're going to find a spot
for you to be in I'm going to new school
as well this year and I don't know that
many people so I'm in the same boat as
you I get how it can be nerve-wracking
but something that helps me just like be
calm and like think about it is there's
so many key
in that school there's going to be at
least two or three people that are going
to want to be your friends that are
gonna just come on like come this way I
friends you're going to make a lot of
new friends high school middle school
elementary school it's a place to make
friends especially high school it's like
your lifelong friends so don't be too
nervous about it just be yourself
somebody's going to be there for you and
also what I like to think about is
you're not the only new one and if you
are once again there are so many other
kids but if you're but for those of you
who are not the only new ones then
there's so many of the people that are
new as well so don't be nervous you can
be new with them maybe you're gonna be
best friends with a new kid
they don't have friends there either so
yeah she said what is the biggest
problem you can discover in high school
and the biggest problem that I've ever
discovered in high school is kind of
like cattiness with girls um there's a
lot of girls and it can be tricky but my
advice with that is just staying away
from it don't get involved with the
drama it's not worth it I promise
so yeah just really staying away from
drama that's one of the biggest problem
and also cramming is another big problem
in high school
you can't cram you really don't have
time to cram anymore so yeah hi Olivia
what's the craziest thing you've done
get the attention for you like that's a
great question um the craziest thing
I've done to get the attention of a guy
I like oh gosh I don't remember
probably something dumb in like sixth
grade I don't know it just being loud
and obnoxious
I was so annoying um I can't think of
like something that really stands out to
me but yeah probably just like probably
like talking to another guy to make
somebody jealous which is just dumb
which is talk to the person you like
give a better answer to more
I wonder what was the weirdest prank
call you have ever made
hi I love you too and the weirdest prank
call I've ever made I don't really know
if this is weird or not but I remember
when we were like a bunch of my friends
and I were little we would like not
little little like 12 like sixth graders
we would always call people like on a
block number and were like hi your water
bra is ready from Victoria's Secret
would you guys like to come pick it up
now it's for your a girlfriend or
something like stupid which was like
weird to think it's not funny at all
like water bra we're not funny
Oh another one that my best friend rocky
and I used to do all the time is that
we'd gone to vlog number and we
literally look up on the computer like
um airplane flight attendant speech and
it's like hi make sure to buckle your
seatbelt if there's a problem the lights
at the bottom of the plane like I mean
would prank call people with that
honestly I don't know I don't know why
we did that but we thought it was really
funny and we'd like speak into it so it
sounded like an echo and it like sounds
like how the flight attendants like you
know voiceover on planes it's so weird
one more as a grade 11 student just
starting on September if you've any tips
that could help make this transition
look great n to create 11 easier advice
on how to balance relationships and just
look at your work done and still study
and be just as focus on school but also
hang out with people that you look cool
on how do you ready for exams
I know exams way way down the line but
just to be prepared and it's just you're
so cute um I probably forgot some of
those questions by exams how do you get
ready for them is just keep all your
work organized so when you hit the end
of the year you've got all your stuff
together and it's way easier to study
how to balance relationships but also do
well in school
um time management just focus on school
during the week as much as you can on
the weekends just try to knock it out or
maybe on Sunday
I don't really like doing work Fridays
and Saturdays that's my time where I'm
like forget school it's a weekend
opinion with my friends and doing
YouTube stuff I love doing and then
Sunday I'm like okay this is work day so
um yeah but main advice for that is
knocking it all out in the week or as
much as you can during the week so you
on the weekend you can hang out with
your friends build some great
relationships and stuff like that and
I'm so sorry I'd remember the first
question you asked I'm the worst
um but yeah thank you guys all so much
