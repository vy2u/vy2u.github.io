hope you're having a great day or again
whenever I post this I feel like I
always say that um today I am filming as
you can tell by the title 25 quick easy
gift ideas because obviously the
holidays are right around the corner so
I definitely want to share with you some
really cute ideas that I thought up or
lift up on Pinterest or just have heard
about or anything like that so if you
guys are in desperate need for some easy
and quick they are not expensive but you
could definitely like make them
expensive I'll get into it with what I
mean by that but um just keep watching
don't forget subscribe if you enjoyed it
make sure give it a thumbs up and let's
get started and I have reindeer ears own
because it's almost Christmas
duh so number one I thought of were cozy
blankets who doesn't love a soft blanket
especially in the wintertime
I love getting soft blankets if I could
recommend anything I would go for a
neutral color so either like a beige a
white a tan of black or a grey because
it's most likely going to go with
something in their house unless they
like a crazy specific color that you
know they only like I would definitely
recommend doing something more on the
neutral side but you can get these at
Target Walgreens I'm sure like Walmart I
don't know different places but I'm sure
you can get these anywhere Amazon online
I mean obviously I suggest going in so
you can feel the blanket like to a store
so I know Target had some really soft
blankets obviously you can get for a
good price or as I was saying intro if
you guys wanting to splurge on a really
expensive soft link or someone you can
so like these types of gifts you can
really just decide how much you want to
spend because they go for all prices but
Target I suggest
number two its coffee mugs who doesn't
love coffee mugs I even love coffee
I don't drink coffee so again target has
such cute coffee mugs but really any
coffee mugs are adorable number three
are sunglasses again this is where you
can either go super cheap or splurge I
recommend like a medium good price it's
key Australia number four candles so
here's where you can go for a really
nice candle which would be expensive or
you can do like bad back and beyond it's
just really really yummy smelling
candles which aren't that expensive
number five is my favorite and I
definitely don't have enough um
fuzzy socks well that's not true I have
a bunch of my beauty room so no be ruins
my carpet even though I suppose 100
things on already but I love fuzzy socks
they are so comfy they keep your feet
warm and they're just really cozy and
cute number six going well with comfort
slippers I love slippers you can get
these literally from anywhere Victoria's
Secret has cute ones too everyone has
really cute ones or bugs I love ugg
boots slippers all of them so cute
number seven is lush products I love
lush products and the best bath bombs
and body scrubs and facial scrubs and
you can basically and moisturizers you
can basically find anything good at lush
number eight have you guys seen the
Sephora gift boxes because they're
incredible they're not super super cheap
but they're not like they are worth so
much and then there's such a good price
number nine is workout attire so like a
sports bra and pants I recommend doing
like I think it'd be really cute to like
a matching
sports bra and leggings set like workout
pants at number ten is a gift card of
any sort so if you don't know what to
get anyone you could literally just get
them an American Express or Amex like
gift card for however much you want to
put on it Starbucks for her eleven is a
phone case and like a phone speaker
everybody loves the speaker if someone
who doesn't have speaker I think it's a
really good
if not all speakers are super expensive
and nobody wants to listen to blasting
music off their phone number 12 is
jewelry so jewelry does not have to be
expensive I know so many places where
you can like customize necklaces for an
initial that are literally like $10
where 13 is perfect if you're in the
cold that's perfect for this season it's
a beanie and a scarf or like little
mittens or whatever you have in mind
I love beanies I love ones that kind of
like slouched off your head a little bit
number 14 is a Polaroid camera
everybody loves Polaroid cameras so why
not 15 is Victoria's Secret pajamas they
have really cute matching PJ's I think
they're like medium price so it's not
like your splurging so so much but
you're not like going super cheap either
it's kind of perfect for like a best
friend I feel like 416 is a fuzzy
bathrobe I got the most comfortable
fuzzy bathroom from Rite Aid one time so
there you go they can be really cheap
and comfortable I still have nine moves
s17 is a swimsuit I thought of this
because during this time at swimsuits
are a little bit more affordable since
it's not like summer and hyped up yet so
I thought it'd be a really cute idea to
like you know get us one to number 18
something that's really in right now I
guess or like mini backpacks is purses
and stuff and brandy melville has so
many different options so I definitely
think you'd find one from like forever
21 or brandy melville and I think it's
just like a really cute gift idea number
19 is like a mini nail polish set this
could be so cheap but everybody loves
like good nail polishes number 20 is a
morphe palette these are not that
expensive they're the best quality
things if you're a boy and your
girlfriend loves makeup get her on more
feet height she will literally be like
wow where did you learn that and you
gonna be oh I just like I don't know but
you give out for me low key for 21 you
could do like a makeup brush set 22 is a
cookbook or an art book for 23 kitchen
supplies kitchen supplies they're fun
they're cute look for 24 is body butters
and like hand sanitizer
and number 25 my last idea for a
Christmas gift to finish off this video
something a little bit more sentimental
because I do want to finish it off by
saying you don't have to pay money to
have a good gift could either do like a
framed photo a jar filled with memories
you could do like reasons why you love
someone those are all my Christmas ideas
it'll be like my antlers are really
trying to get into the season for you
guys and I don't have an ugly Christmas
sweater so I need one you guys are lost
for Christmas thank you so much for
watching I hope you enjoyed it if you
did give it a thumbs up and I'll see you
guys next time
