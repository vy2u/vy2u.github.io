tutorial on this really glittery bronzy
smokey eye with super healthy and glowy
skin perfect for the holiday season just
keep watching if you want to see how to
get it and don't forget to subscribe so
I'm using my foundation primer in the
radiance kind of section for uhm primer
obviously it's by Laura Mercier and I am
just rubbing this into my skin until it
gets a little bit tacky so that my
makeup lasts all day long and I'm also
spraying a little bit of Smashbox photo
finish primer water all over my face
just to make sure that my makeup really
lasts and this also just makes your skin
look super glowy in Radian I'm then
going in with my honest Asya brow Wiz
and this is in the shade soft Brown and
I absolutely love this because you can
get your eyebrows to look so even and so
full so quickly it's a really really
good beginners product this is what I've
been using ever since I really started
doing makeup because I just find it to
be so easy and my eyebrows are never
even they're literally sisters not twins
ones sometimes super square one super
arched so I love this product to even
them out and then I'm going in with my
honest Razia brow gel and I am just
running through my eyebrows to make sure
that they stick when I'm doing
foundation when I put on my eye shadow
and right before I do my eye shadow I
like to prime my eyes I'm using my
Maybelline age rewind concealer which is
such a throwback I haven't use this in
so long so I'm just covering up all my
veins and then setting it with some
powder and then I'm going in with my
morphe 35n palette and it's an all matte
palette and you guys just saw I pointed
to that really light brown shade and I'm
just running this through my crease and
I just keep doing that this is my
transition shade and then in that same
palette I'm going all the way to the
left and I believe it's the second row
down and just taking another light brown
honestly you guys don't have to get this
exact palette whatever grounds you have
is perfect and works really really well
for this look and then I'm going in with
a more precise crease brush and taking
that dark kind of I don't know kind of
looks like crumb delay from makeup geek
but
I'm just running this through my crease
and this kind of changes the look it
gives us so much more warmth and
definition and dimension to our eye and
this is definitely a must so you want to
get a really good transition shade as
you see I had some trial and errors but
I love this one so then I'm going in
with my morphe 35w palette and i'm
taking that shade you just saw and
blending it in with the same brush and
then picking up a clean brush and just
blending out the edges I just use a
really light brown in and show you but
it's really just any basic Brown just to
blend out the edges and then I'm going
in with this Sigma eyelet link down
below
oh no it's right here I found it it's
the Sigma e25 blending brush and I just
used it on a really dark kind of
plumbing ground shade and I'm just
blending that into the outer corners of
my crease this shade is amazing this
brush is amazing this brush it makes it
really really easy to blend and just
pack on products because it's the
perfect shape and then I'm taking that
same Sigma what brush is this let me see
e3 5 blending brush and then I'm taking
that Sigma e-40 that huge one right
there to blend it all out sorry that's
no unorganized I'm just as you can see I
keep picking up products and just
blending it out and just making sure
everything is nice and even and then I'm
going in with my urban decay setting
spray and just a flat shader brush this
is just by BH Cosmetics it doesn't have
a name but with my 35n palette 35w
palette sorry I'm going in with that
really shimmery gold shade and just
packing it on with that flat shader
brush and then I'm taking that Sigma e35
brush and blending it out this is my
favorite part I'm using the Sigma
glitter and I am just blending this all
over my eyelid basically not blending
kind of patting it it's the midsummer
loose shimmer and it is perfect it
completely change the look it gives so
much more dimension and just kind of off
to your eyelid I don't really know the
right word but it looks amazing and you
can see what I'm doing here just packing
that on and
and really precisely you'll see I'm
blending it out but being super careful
with just a fluffy blending brush I
don't want to go super hard on it or
anything like that and being so so
careful and then I'm just taking any
clean brush and blending the shimmers
under my eyes away and then once again
I'm going in with that Sigma e25 brush
and taking that dark plum shade again
basically I just keep repeating the
steps you can see what I'm doing I'm
then taking a pencil brush from Mac and
I'm just taking that plum shade I kept
putting on my e to five brush that outer
corner shade and I'm dragging it on my
lower lash line and then after I am done
doing that I'm going to take a little
bit of you'll see in a second but not
the Sigma loose shimmer but I'm taking C
right here i'm taking my morphe
shimmer from the 35w palette and I'm
blending that down and then I'm taking
my Sigma so it's just kind of a repeat
of what we have on our eyelid just so it
evens out the top and bottom lashline
and then I'm also taking a little bit of
Jaclyn hill champagne pop and Prosecco
pop and just spraying this with some
fix+ or whenever I use Smashbox I don't
know and just putting that on my inner
corner and then I'm doing tiny tiny bit
of mascara before I apply my false
lashes you will see I struggled a little
bit with this but I eventually got it I
got one on and then I tried to show you
really quickly how I did my other but as
you will be able to tell no one's
perfect no one can get this right away I
struggle with it so much hopefully one
day I'll be one of the youtubers that
can just like BAM put it on you're like
how did she do that but as of right now
I'm a 17 year old attempting to put this
on my lash line and then after I finally
got that on I just coat both my lashes
with a little bit more mascara by the
way I prefer using clear lash glue just
so you know and then I'm using a damp
Beauty Blender and taking my Too Faced
Born This Way
foundation I'm mixing the shade nude and
natural beige to get the perfect shade
and I'm just blending this all over this
is definitely a more full coverage look
so I'm taking kind of a lot I'm not
using a super heavy hand with my Beauty
Blender or my products but I definitely
use more than an everyday wear and then
I'm also going to go in with my instant
age rewind concealer and just highlight
the crap out of my face
I'm just gonna take my damp Beauty
blender and blend blend blend blend
blend
by the way I don't know why I have a
really big stain on my shirt
only I would manage to stay in a black
shirt I'm really annoying it bothers me
about the whole video I'm sorry I just
called tension to it but if you notice
deepest apologies anyway
I'm just gonna continue blending that in
with my damp Beauty Blender I think this
kind of just gives a lot of life to your
face and then I'm setting it with my Ben
Nye neutral set colorless face powder
and I'm just baking with my Beauty
Blender so it all stays and then I'm
going in with my Clinique chubby stick I
think it's called in curvy contour and I
am just putting this all over my face
and then using a damp Beauty blender to
blend this out I love this it gives so
much warmth and glow and doing this to
the skin so I'm definitely a fan and it
blends out really really easily
especially if you use a damp Beauty
Blender and then just to kind of go over
that make it more intense I'm using this
Too Faced bronzer and I absolutely love
this this is the Sun bunny natural
bronzer and I'm just using this with a
sigma small contour fo5 brush which just
kind of gave more life to our face which
I really really really loved and then of
course I need a little bit more warmth
and glow to my skin but before that I'm
going to wipe away my baking and just I
use this with any kind of tapered brush
this one's from Sigma whatever you have
and then as I said any more gloves so
I'm using gold deposit mineral
skinfinish by Mac and I'm just kind of
lightly blending this over my skin this
may look like a lot but at the end it
kind of just all works and then I'm
taking a little bit more spray and then
highlighting so I love highlighting and
using the champagne pop and Prosecco pop
this is from Jacqueline hills of face
palette but as you can see I'm just
putting it on all the high points of my
face my cheekbones everywhere that I
think I need a little bit of glow which
is essentially my whole face and then a
little bit on my lip because I love the
look of it you guys don't have to you
can do what you want but that's
basically what I'm doing you could
totally see and then I am lining my lips
with Kylie Jenner's lip liner or Kylie
cosmetics whatever it's called in the
shade exposed and then I'm just filling
that in I think it's a really nice nude
it might have gone a little bit neuter
if I could do this over maybe not so
much color but I still really like the
look of it I use a white lipstick I
think it's called and I use that in the
shade cashew and that's it so thank you
so so much for watching I love you guys
I hope you enjoyed the look make sure to
give it a thumbs up and I'll see you
guys next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
