to my youtube channel today I'm doing
the very very requested how I edit my
Instagram photos this has been so
requested since I mentioned it in my
last vlog so I wanted to make sure I got
enough a stop for you guys and yeah now
here we are so if you guys want to see
how I edit my Instagram photos then just
keep watching and don't forget to hit
that subscribe button and turn on my
notifications if you're new here and
yeah I have all my social media right
here so let's get into it
okay so usually you guys are probably
gonna be surprised I used to edit on
like vsco cam and all these different
editing apps but now I literally just
use Instagram since I found like my Holy
Grail filter so I'm on my Instagram page
right now and as you can see I kind of
have like a pink tone to all my photos I
don't know if you can tell it started
like right about here my shoot with
Brian so like all these photos this
photo my sister took of me at Coachella
it turned out kind of cute I felt like I
didn't have to face you in or edit it so
I just loaded that straight onto
Instagram and I use the filter Aden it
kind of gives like a pink tan overcast
and I really like how it looks so once
you tap it you can see the difference
and then I usually just go to the edit
tool and I bring the brightness down
quite a bit I bring my contrast up a
little bit give you everything right a
little bit more I bring the warmth a
little bit of saturation and that's
basically all I really do I play with
highlights and shadows sometimes not
normally though and yeah that's like the
first photos on them and I just post it
I don't take that much on my Instagram
because I feel like it's not most
important thing in the world to me so I
just kind of play around with what I
think will look cool so that's the first
thing I'll show you guys with another
photo what that would look like
so with this selfie I posted this selfie
a while ago before I started editing
this way so I didn't even know about
this so let's see how this filter looks
sometimes I don't even like how it looks
yeah I guess I kind of like that so just
kind of like playing around with warm
saturation so that's how I do those I'll
show you guys one more with that filter
so this little picture was for a
thumbnail use that same filter it makes
me a little bit tanner which I like
especially when I've been done
brightness/contrast like I want to bring
the highlights up a little shadows maybe
down a warmth a little saturation and
then BAM next photo is already completed
so I kind of just like doing stuff like
that little edits if I want to actually
edit a photo go to my editing little
thing and I'll just use the app face you
sure you guys know what this is let's
say I want to do this one I took this
little selfie right before I started
flowing this video and it's okay I don't
love it
I would probably smooth parts of my skin
maybe like around my lip and like my
smile lines I don't know just like play
around with this new thing just make my
skin less oily probably like about all I
would do though yeah probably do
something like that maybe detail my eyes
at the ends right there so the makeup
looks like a little bit more puffy and
I'll never construct my jaw or move my
nose or enhance my lips if I feel the
need to do that I just won't post the
photo at all like I said in my last vlog
like before I posted I was like severely
just weeding my nose like if I felt that
way I just wouldn't post the photo you
know what I mean and then also I don't
really like how there's like a little
bit of hair right there joke's on me I
don't even know how to get rid of that I
think you can go to patch yeah I don't
know what I'm doing okay I'm just
kidding
you know what kind of leave it yeah
that's all I do for face tune basically
I just mostly smooth my upper lip
because I have freckles on it and
sometimes I don't like how that looks in
photos I'll go back to my Instagram I'll
choose that photo that I just edited and
then I go to my filter I love this
filter and then I bring the brightness
down a little bit here the contrast that
give me the warrant maybe the saturation
and bam it's edited so it's pretty
self-explanatory it's pretty easy here
I'm just gonna screenshot it cuz I don't
want to post it because you guys are
quick I might even go to visco ignore
that there was like the Instagram filter
and I might go to edit and I might use
the grain tool to make it have like an
old and then I might save that instead
I'm gonna make her back to Instagram and
I might those do it I don't know
something like that sometimes I like
putting a little grain on the filter so
that's what that one would look like oh
also this photo which I already posted
but it's the one of me on a golf cart so
I might bring the brightness down a
little bit bring the contrast up bring a
little bit of warmth some golf cart a
little saturation to the golf cart photo
maybe play with the shadows just kind of
see how I like it and then it kind of
gives that like I don't know pinkish tan
overview overcast a little hue then I
post it and that's pretty much it I used
to also really like this filter on vsco
cam which I'll show you guys because
we're here so why not it was called oh
six ooh just kind of enhances it gives a
little bit of color you might take the
contrast out in that photo so yeah I
just gives it a little bit of color and
the only thing with oh six sometimes it
gives like a green kind of filter I
don't really know how to explain it so I
might not like that but I think that
looks cute and then I would just
probably crop this and say kind of
messed it up yeah I might just crop it
like that and let it be kind of makes it
less pink though so I don't know if it
go with my flow but you know what I care
about that as much so I think that looks
pretty cute
it probably won't end up posting this
just because my whole Instagram isn't
the basically selfies at this point you
guys want to follow my Instagram this is
it we're almost done 900k so let's see
if this video can get me to 900,000 that
would be crazy I just kind of play
around but I guess the main thing I
don't really do too much is like face
tune I used to be really obsessed with
face tune I went through a phase a face
gym let me show you I went through it
like right around this time like that
photo from March 23rd my skin was like
smoothed out and stuff my eyes just look
huge I don't know when I get to this
photo I look like a creepy Bratz doll
this photo I think I tried to add
highlighter to my face just looks like
my cheeks are white like I've had some
good face student fails so now to keep
it natural here especially since I don't
want to put an unrealistic image out
there if you know what I mean so that's
it for this video thank you guys for

thumbs up if you enjoyed it it means so
