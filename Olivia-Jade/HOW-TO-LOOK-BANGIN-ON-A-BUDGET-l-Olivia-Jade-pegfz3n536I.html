today's video I am doing something a
little bit different as you can tell by
the title I'm going to give you guys my
best tips and tricks on how to look
bangin on a budget I know a lot of
people don't want to go out or don't
really have the option to go out and
spend thousands of dollars on cool shoes
or cool purses or cool sneakers or nice
jewelry but I'm here to tell you you
don't need to spend thousands of dollars
to look high-end so if you guys want to
hear some of my tips and tricks because
I always there a lot of comments saying
I'm Brad yeah we're really nice stuff
and a lot of it are just some really
good steals that look high-end let's see
might not be super high-end so if you
guys like this video please give it a
thumbs up and subscribe if you want and
let's get started I have a little I
planned this out a little bit more so
I'm going to just kind of read all my
phone for my tips and tricks my number
one tip is accessorizing accessorizing
automatically takes you to a whole new
level for example these earrings they
are from forever 21 but you probably
want to guess they're from forever 21
because they don't look super cheap and
the way I accept I did is with a layered
necklace that is from Lou's I believe
that should have only been a couple
bucks maybe 10 dollars I don't really
remember I will link it all down below
but accessorizing literally will become
your best friend when you're looking a
little bit more high-end
so some of my favorite places to get
accessories are places like September 21
hmm misguided ASOS all those kind of
trendy online shops and also Windsor has
some really cute inexpensive jewelry as
well so I just wanted to show you at
some of my favorite options from forever
21 like these star shaped hoop earrings
they are only four dollars and ninety
cents and I think they're just different
which automatically makes them look a
little bit more high-end along with
these bar charms earrings that are only
three dollars and ninety cents
they're just a little bit different
different vibes or silver so it kind of
gives an edgy look and I really love how
it just adds something to a very basic
outfit and if you're not a hoop gal or
guy stud earring sets from forever 21 or
only like eight dollars and ninety cents
here as you can see and they're so
beautiful I
they look so intricate and all the
details make them look high-end and also
all the different colors and fake like
jewels and stuff in them will go with a
lot of different outfits which is really
awesome watches always to me make you
look a little bit classier and high-end
I have this amazing watch from Lulu's
I'm going to link it down below if you
guys I think it's like 20 bucks and it
looks so high-end and fancy and nice and
it's just like this rose gold I also
just want to take a quick pause to show
you this watch from Lois it's rose gold
and it's only $24 I think this looks a
lot more high-end than a watch with a
strap band and I think it's pretty
inexpensive for a good quality watch so
I just wanted to mention that as an
option for you guys I also wanted to
show you a few examples I have some
forever 21 earrings right here I love
these I'm wearing from 2013 one if you
can't tell I love their earrings just
because they're so simple but you would
never guess these are forever 21 I think
the best way to accessorize is by just
doing really simple accessories that
look nice so like just some gold-plated
earrings or silver whatever your taste
is whatever color you like that's what I
would stick to I wouldn't go for all the
diamonds and like the extra boo genus
because it automatically looks a little
bit cheaper I'm going to link a bunch of
jewelry that I think is really pretty
down below so my next tip is dupes or
knock off items if you just kind of
search in something like let's say
you've been wanting a cardio ring for a
really long time but they are very
expensive and not everyone can just go
out and drop thousands of dollars on
jewelry - knockoff party a ring knockoff
or replicas or juice or whatever and
you're going to get really similar
options that are way more affordable
outfits and shopping for outfits and how
to shop for outfits and all of that jazz
so some of my favorite places to shop
for outfit online are forever 21 H&amp;amp;M
ASOS Zara Urban Outfitters which can be
a little expensive it depends what
you're getting on Urban Outfitters but
those types of more affordable websites
I guess my number one tip when shopping
for outfits on affordable websites is
staying away from pattern I
automatically think pattern instantly
makes clothing look cheap
I'm like floral patterns' and I mean
that all my forever 21 and 8,000 stuff
because when I have floral patterns from
places such as a Prince of Polly and
Lou's and Sora and those types of
websites it's usually okay but for the
websites that are very affordable like
forever 21 and H&amp;amp;M I would stay away
from pattern my favorite things to get
on forever 21 and hmm are bodysuits cool
pants cool shoes cool accessories I how
many times that I say cool I don't even
know so I wanted to show you guys a
little outfit from forever 21 my body
suit and these pants are both from
forever 21 and I will link a similar
pair of boots down below for in it like
an inexpensive price but I absolutely
love this outfit because it's so casual
but it just looks really put together
their body suits fit really well and
they range in a bunch of different
prices and the pants are kind of cute
and different as well so I just wanted
to show you an option if it doesn't look
good on the model it's probably not
going to look good in person because
they try and perfect all of those photos
so if you don't like how it looks on the
model I walk right away from it it's
really rare that if it looks horrible in
model and it comes in the mail it's
going to be this amazing piece because
they tried their best on models you'll
notice websites like forever 21 and ASOS
and H&amp;amp;M are the first websites to knock
off more expensive stuff so for example
are you a my it's a website they got
super famous for their like straight
across last body - and they're kind of
ruffle off the shoulder shirt and
there's a lot of websites like forever
21 and H&amp;amp;M that will pick right up on
those pieces and kind of put them on
their own site I want to talk about lose
and ASOS so my shoes in from ASIS you
can find so many sneakers from ASOS
these are kind of like a faux leather
with this silver star on them so they
give off a very saint-laurent vibe on
camera they looked a little weird they
had a weird shape on camera but in
person they're one of my favorite pairs
of shoes they look awesome and they look
really structured I'm going to link a
bunch of other shoes from ASOS down
below that I think are affordable and
kind of give off that statement or
i n / also found some shoes from
forever21 that look very coochie I'm
going to link those down below for you
guys so I think a key outfit just to
wear out is something simple and easy
such as this little black dress in
movies you put a cute little dress on
you get your hair slicked back you have
some nice makeup on you put those cute
sneakers on that's a really cute night
outfit whether you're going to a high
school party or a little hangout or
dinner or whatever it might be or a
college event or work or whatever a date
you know I'm kind of fine but this also
automatically makes you look put
together if you're put together is
another way just to look high-end if you
kind of have unmatching pieces and you
just kind of look all over the place
people aren't going to think oh wow she
looks really up there and looks like you
put a lot of money and time into that
outfit if you don't even spend that much
money but you kind of just get your
stuff together you're automatically
going to look more high-end it's a
little obvious a little easy trick but
it's one my favorites one of my next tip
is online shopping is going to be your
best friend because coupon codes and
promo codes now sometimes it can be a
little bit difficult but just think
about it all your favorite youtubers
probably have a coupon code or an online
code or something out there if you look
at their description box they will
usually list below their affiliate code
I actually don't do that but if you want
to self care yourself I have the code
Olivia at Lovington if you buy and move
to get a free mint so that's just an
example
I actually don't make any money off of
that that was literally just benefiting
you because I love you guys but I know a
lot of youtubers have affiliate codes
with really great brands all the reviews
are shopping online let's say on
misguided and you type in misguided
promo code there could be stuff online
on Groupon or RetailMeNot or whatever
website that comes up that just gives
you a special promo code so as you can
see right now this guide is having a 40%
off sale on their vacation and festival
shop so shop the vacation you can pick
out any of these pieces and then use the
code shake it right here to get 40% off
that's pretty good hopefully when you
watch this this is still a thing but
McGrattan usually has really good sales
I don't know why it's such a thing and
when Society has a look of high end but
I don't think there's anything wrong
with loving yourself and trying to just
you know up your day
it doesn't hurt anybody and I hope these
little tips and tricks help you that is
it for this video I hope this helps you
a tiny bit as much as I could and if you
guys want to see more of my tips and
tricks for looking high end please let
me know I hope you guys always banging
on a budget after this even though I'm
sure you're all beautiful and this does
not mean you need to go out and spend
money money money even if it's not a lot
of money to make yourself look good this
was just a fun video that was requested
I've seen this on YouTube before and I
thought I could maybe have some tips
that could help some people I don't
really know but I don't want anybody to
think I'm saying you have to do all this
to look high-end I hope you guys love
this video and yeah I'll see you guys
next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
