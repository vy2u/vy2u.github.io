to my youtube channel in today's video
I'm going to be doing a bangin on a
budget or know how I was buying it on a
budget part two I really wanted to make
this video again because a lot of people
came up to me in person and told me how
much it helped them my first one they
took so many tips and tricks and I got
so many tweets about it so I definitely
wanted to do something like this video
again so I thought I would just do a
part two if you guys want to see a few
tricks I came up with for how to look
banging on a budget and please keep
watching and I hope you enjoy I'm also
going to have my first video link down
below for you guys in case you missed
any of those tricks because I do talk
about a lot of different things in that
videos and I'm going to be talking about
in this video so links will be down
below because they don't mean to miss it
but first but that was my number one tip
straight off the bat and that is sale
sale websites I don't really know how to
what they're called but things like
Nordstrom Rack Saks office etc how to
bang on a budget literally these
websites are high-end items for its
counted prices so although it's not
going to be like a forever 21 you're
getting really good quality things
okay so first Nordstrom Rack they have
clothes and you know accessories
everything but I wanted to show you guys
handbags I looked at crossbody bags but
they have really good wallets really
good totes and I really liked this bag
specifically in black and in tan I felt
the spikes kind of give a very Valentino
look and it was only $22 so I thought I
would just point that one out I'll link
it down below but they also do carry
bigger brands like Marc by Marc Jacobs I
know this is still pretty expensive
around 150 bucks but it was originally
$300 so that is 50% off I just wanted to
show you guys that option so you can
find all those different seals on
plaques offices Nordstrom Rack all those
types of websites which are Norton Rack
is direct from Nordstrom Saks office is
obviously derived from Saks Fifth Avenue
etc I don't know if there's any more but
those are my two favorite I definitely
suggest looking at them you're going to
find amazing deals of a really good
quality items okay number two is such a
big tip
that I can't believe I didn't mention in
my first video and it's a website called
Polyvore I discovered this website
probably when I was around 10 years old
maybe 11 I used to be really into
fashion and looking at different fashion
websites online all this stuff and poly
board is basically like a website where
you can filter a bunch of things I'm
going to show you guys on the computer
and do a little overlay and maybe
voiceover what I'm trying to say right
now okay
voice over time so I want to show you
guys one of my favorite things to do on
poly board which is check out outfits so
the community all probably board people
that have accounts can create an outfit
for example I liked this one I love this
black backpack that they put on there
but it is a thousand dollars so below as
you can see there are a bunch of similar
backpacks with the prices next to them
so you can see what works for your
budget that one's 40 dollars the other
one was $88
this one's 50 dollars but yeah I think
it's just an amazing way to find dupes
and also you can do like different
sections on Polyvore so let's say you
want shoes you can filter it so it's
under $50 and that will show you a bunch
of shoes that are under $50 for example
those amazing blue furry slides and also
if you want to go to specific sections
like you just want sneakers you don't
want sandals and whatever you can curate
it so it's under $50 you can see what's
on sale you apply that filter and then
it will show you a bunch of different
options like these Puma shoes that are
all in socks office for $50 they have
these conversations
a really great website I seriously
recommend checking it out it's super
easy to use and not sponsored that
sounded sponsored it's not so the third
tip is pairing nice things with cheap
basics I feel like this is pretty
obvious but I also feel like a lot of
people feel the need to buy what
influencers and celebrities and all this
stuff are wearing and that's not always
the case of my fan pages have created
closet accounts for me which is like my
hair thing to stuff but a lot of stuff I
wear sometimes can be a little bit more
expensive but I do want to let you guys
know just because I'm wearing an
expensive thing doesn't mean you have to
go and buy that expensive thing to get
the look along with like celebrities and
stuff so I do want to show you guys a
few dupes that I found oops again big
thing so the little black frilly top is
actually from forever 21 it was very
on-trend it's not the exact one it's
actually a little bit different which I
like but it's similar to the one from
our um I and I paired up with this Gucci
bag I know that this is Gucci it's not
budget-friendly at all but I found this
really great website and I'm going to
link it down below where they have like
kind of duplicates of these high-end
bags so as you can see my bag here I'm
going to put a picture of the other bag
that I'm talking about right here
and you guys can see that they're almost
identical and the one that is on the
screen obviously isn't as much money so
I will link that website down below it's
a great great website for dupes I would
say if you want that effect that look I
also think pairing something super basic
with something a little bit more
high-end whether it's your real Gucci or
a look-alike bag or just a plain black
bag or whatever it is if you just kind
of style it right keeping it really
simple always makes it look a lot more
elegant and classy looks like in a
hundred dollar shirt but also you styled
it right with some high-waisted cool
Levi's vintage jeans a nice pump a nice
bag
you would never know my shirt was from
forever 21 maybe what if you have it or
if you're going to be night look sheets
and maybe also it number four is DIY
this is something I used to not really
ever do because I'm not
Arceus craftiest person in the world but
I found DIY is my obsession now because
I just cut all my shirts I don't like
into crop tops and then I suddenly like
them I have a banty or something that
I'm just not that into I'll just snip
out and make it a cute little clock up
so GI Ryung is great you can literally
buy a shirt from Target or Walmart or
wherever and just snip it if you want a
white crop top just get a white shirt
from Target or wherever you want and
snip it okay so as you can see I'm just
cutting my shirt I don't have the best
as theirs but it turned out alright I
cleaned up the edges after I was done so
you can do this with a band tee with
white shirt with green shirt whatever
you want and then it will turn out
something like this
and now I'm going to be way more
inclined to wear this and I didn't have
to spend extra money and my last tip is
flea market and drifting and all that I
have never been thrift shopping
and I've never been to a flea market boy
by now if you wanted to say this back
home so ridiculous plot my friends go
surfing and silly micro chopping I know
a lot of youtubers do it too and it's
just a really good way to find like
vintage Levi's and all that other stuff
for way better prices literally give you
the flea market buy you all my friends
go on Sunday if you live in LA I know
there's one on Melrose I think it is I
really want to go you can just find like
really good prices of all these items
whether it's like jewelry or a scarf
like a good pretty wrap around beach
cover-up for a vintage jacket or
whatever it might be
sunglasses whether they the list goes on
the flea market and thrift shops and all
that are going to have it for way better
prices so I feel like that's an obvious
one but I thought I'd mention it for my
last and final tip thank you for
watching I hope you guys enjoyed this
