do my updated everyday kind of going out
makeup look this isn't what I do every
single day because if you watch my vlogs
you know I don't wear makeup every
single day but this is what I do what
I'm going out with friends and I'm going
out to party I'm just like on a date
maybe just like a little bit more than
your natural no makeup makeup like
there's definitely makeup on me but it
looks very natural and like my skin and
it's not cakey so that's kind of my
favorite look to go for and yeah if you
guys want to see what I do then just
keep watching and don't forget I'm about
to having to make foam and scare the
hell out of you you haven't subscribed
make sure to subscribe and let's do it I
think I wore this shirt and like a
different everyday makeup tutorial
Lowell so something I've been doing all
the time is um doing a little bit of
like a primer highlight I'm using this
Marc Jacobs dewdrops and it is so glowy
I just take like a little bit and I kind
of just go like all over I try and focus
it like at the high points but then it
just kind of ends up everywhere I don't
know I personally like how this looks
when I put into moisturizer on top it's
like my favorite thing but again to each
its own is that the frickin expression I
don't know I already applied moisturizer
before so I kind of just do that and
then I mix some tinted moisturizers I
used the Laura Mercier tinted
moisturizer in the shade nude and tawny
and I mix them and that kind of matches
my fake tan but one of them is oil-free
which is this one one of them's not
really matter to me I just mix it
together
I just take any sort of flat brush and
blend it out then I just take a little
Beauty Blender and go over it well I
take a little bit of tart shape tape and
this is a little lighter than my face
it's in the shade light neutral and I
just focus it like really close to under
my eyes
I like making sure that like literally
like almost my lower lash line is
covered with cannot really like you'll
see what I mean I don't know where I
think it makes my eyes pop and it's
really hard to make my eye pop since
they're brown so I just kind of keep it
like really close and then blend outward
take a Beauty Blender
I'm gonna usually take a little bit of
this powder this is just the laura
mercier one and i set around my mouth
because i have freckles there and i like
to bring a little brightness and i also
just kind of take it and clean up right
here after that's done I go in with a
little bit of bronzer by the way I know
I'm using a little bit of expensive
makeup whatever you guys have you guys
can just use the techniques and the
brushes if you like how it turns out but
you don't have to get these exact
products but I would suggest getting
four powder if you want to save up for
one of these it would be Laura Mercier
it's my favorite I switch between
bronzers all the time I've been loving
this Marc Jacobs Omega bronzer in 102
tantrik but then Bobby Brown golden like
the classic I love the Physicians
Formula butter bronzer and honestly
whatever I've been using this a lot
lately and I've been taking it on like a
really nice tapered brush this one is
the stigma spotlight duster and I just
take a little bit of the product and
really lightly like carve my cheekbones
out just gives a really light wash of
color but I think it's beautiful
we're gonna do that no get ready fast
let's go give me up oh I'm getting text
messages from people that I love I got a
lot of it talk to it okay okay sorry
okay so I put a little bit of bronzer on
and then I'm gonna wipe it away the
powers not bronzer just take a powder
brush and kind of blend out where I had
powder on my face and then I give a nice
good spritz whatever settings right you
guys have works this one was the
Smashbox photo-finish so chilled coconut
primer water oops its primer good to
know I just like when it melts it into
my skin alright brows I don't really
care what I use for brows this is in my
drawer so I'm gonna use it it's the
benefit
precisely my brow pencil and then
pressure I'll take the other side
fill it in I just do like the tail hope
I'm not boring you probably am knowing
myself this is like my favorite brow gel
ever Sephora collection my hand is a
mess and I'm just going to use this and
then set my face again cuz I'm extra and
highlight if I could find it done me
sick
I'm gonna go in with cream highlight
because I want to be able going in with
a cream highlight cuz I want it to be a
little bit more natural and I just use
my finger whatever cream you have NYX
has the best cream highlight ever only
get below I'm just using this one I feel
like in my makeup tutorials my everyday
stuff hasn't changed too much but I know
I have a lot of new followers and I have
a done one in a while and you guys just
like I feel like seeing me get older and
just doing it so I'm here I am and then
I'm gonna spray my face once again I
know this is unnecessary but like I just
love how it feels on my nose there
they're all right there now for the eyes
I first just do a really light coat of
mascara this one's the Maybelline times
Gigi Hadid everyone you have like a
really light amount just so they're
somewhat black and then I take my
favorite are gel whispies they're not
the demi whispies they're just the
normal whiskey's and I take a spoolie
and I just brush it out this is an easy
way to make your chief lashes look like
more wispy and fluttery and just more
natural like your lash I'm gonna make
sure on so long this is fun by the way I
feel like some youtubers when they do
makeup tutorial
like no shade at all whatever however
people know where the makeup is amazing
but it can look kind of cakey in person
I want you guys to know that this is
like very light weight like you don't
look like you have a lot of makeup on
because sometimes it's hard to tell on
camera when you copy a tutorial it looks
so good on camera and then in real life
it just looks super cakey this doesn't
look cakey it's really good really good
really great really fresh okay I'm bored
of doing that I take tweezers and I take
one and you always cut from the outer
corners so these are way too long I
already know how much I like to cut them
just cuz I do this all the time so do
you see how there's little dots I cut to
the fourth one so like one two three
four sorry my memory card ran out of
space sorry if it moved
anyway as I saying was I just cut one of
the lashes and then I do that on the
other side
then I take my favorite glue this is the
art oh no no it's not it's the duo
eyelash adhesive and clear and I just
put a little bit on anything you want to
throw out and then I just take a brush
the back of a brush like this I get my
tweezers I hold the lash I dip it in the
glue and then I just like slowly coat
the lash and then I do like two little
dots on the corners because it's the
worst when they don't stick to the
corners and then I give that like a good
minute to get really sticky so when you
first place it on your eyelash it
doesn't like mess mess up or slip around
that's like the hardest thing with
applying lashes is if you just do it
right away you'll never get it get my
mirror I just like right on there I hope
I successfully do this on camera
then I just pulled the inner corner and
then I just let it dry and an amazing
tool hold on here it is it looks like
this and what I do is I just take like
the corner and just press it all in and
then it dries and we're gonna make it a
little bit more natural in a second but
yeah I'm gonna go ahead and do that on
the other eye and then I'll be right
back
so now that my lashes are on I like to
spray my face again of course just a
little a little bit I usually don't wear
lower mascara because it transfers for
me and then it ends up under my eyes and
I just don't like it I like to curl my
fake lash with my real lashes okay
okay and then I will go grab my favorite
lip gloss and we'll be right back okay
I'm back did you miss me all right and
then I just like to use this glossy a
I'm so sorry for all the noise outside
but it's there just gloss it's in clear
and it's amazing just makes your lips
like so nice um and that's basically all
I really do for my everyday makeup
we're not every day but like when I'm
going out I guess um yeah hope you guys
enjoyed it and I hope it helped kind of
it it's pretty easy and it looks very
natural I usually give myself one more
spray let's not be fooled shall it a
little bit I literally love how that
feels but yeah thank you guys for
