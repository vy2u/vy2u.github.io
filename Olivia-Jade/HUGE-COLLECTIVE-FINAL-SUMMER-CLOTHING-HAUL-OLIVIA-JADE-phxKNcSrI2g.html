channel today I am doing a huge clothing
haul this is kind of like my final
summer clothing haul before I move into
back to school videos be sure to leave
video requests down below for
back-to-school series because it's that
time it's coming to that time so I hope
you guys leave me some requests and with
that being said let's get into this
massive clothing haul so since this is
my last clothing haul the summer I'm
doing this collective ad so the first
thing I'm going to start with is this
hat because this hat was sent to me
today and now I'm obsessed um where's
this problem this is from Maison
Michelle Paris and it's so cute Chanel
Samia perfume it's the number 5 this
stuff smells amazing and they also sent
this but it's not Chanel so I don't
really I don't know but I love it so
Thank You Chanel
and then um which is so weird for me to
say like oh thanks Chanel for sending me
stuff Chanel like who are you Olivia I'm
gonna get into the clothing let's start
with something I have over worn like way
too much this black dress from we're
starting with brandy melville so this
black dress is like a v-neck right here
and it's just spaghetti shops whatever
they're called and it is a maxi dress
it's pretty simple it's just been my
absolute favorite thing I wore this in
my get ready with me Hamptons edition
video so you guys can see kind of what
it looked like on there I posted a photo
in it on my Instagram and yeah it just
goes all the way down like that to your
ankles and I'm five five or five four
and a half ish for those of you
wondering how tall I am so you know if
it fits you're not I wore that dress so
much that I had to pick up another color
um this is like this kind of olive green
with black side stripes on it so it's
the exact same thing is the black one
except in this kind of pattern I really
love them they're super comfy and I
think they look really nice on Housley
from brandy melville what I picked up
was this black bodysuit which I love so
much it's so easy to pair this with
anything it's just a plain black
bodysuit but honestly I've worn this
like countless times and it's just super
super soft and good-quality I feel like
and it wasn't too expensive everything I
can find you know like down below but
what I can't find I'm just going to tell
you where it's wrong um so yeah I
probably can find this on their website
but um you just like stripped down going
to the bathroom huh what can you do
the next place I went in New York when
you're shopping with H&amp;amp;M and it only got
two things from there and the pants I'm
gonna show you first they're wild
basically my mom strongly encouraged me
to get these pants because she thought
they would look super cute I think
they're fun I mean I would definitely
never wear something like this so I was
like what the hell like I'll just get
them moms treating me gonna take her up
on it so my mom also loves H&amp;amp;M nice
pants Oh crazy I know they are just like
this trouser I guess and it's just like
it's a really nice length and they are
just crazy they look like this they also
had a pair and white and they just a
plain white when they didn't have my
size but I wanted to get those because I
thought that would be really cute with
like a crop top for the summer and like
this kind of hat or something like that
but yeah basically these pants are
pretty crazy but I really think they're
fun and I wore them with the black
bodysuit
he looked really cool for the Broadway
show in New York so I don't know I just
wear them with little sneakers like low
tops on high tops obviously I don't
think high tops would really go with
this but they're crazy they're fun
you'll love you know next from H&amp;amp;M got
this off the shoulder top
you guys know my love for off the
shoulders at off the shoulder like vibe
is like really Hamptons sexy chic look
from VidCon let's switch into that a
little bit before VidCon I went shopping
for outfits and I only really found one
thing that I absolutely adored which was
really cute um or I think it's cute
dress from Reformation Reformation
doesn't tend to have the most affordable
things they're like pretty expensive but
I wanted something really quality for
VidCon that fit me nicely that looked
cute and that I could obviously rewear
so
this dress was a cute little find for
VidCon and I wear it all the time now
ward in New York loved it so much so
tying into the VidCon theme I went to
Calvin Klein when I was there and they
spoiled me like no tomorrow so I
couldn't find all my stuff since I've
worn it so much so some of the Calvin
Klein stuff is in the wash but I did
want to show you some of the stuff that
was in my closet know that I could show
it from Calvin Klein because it was
awesome this jean jacket they gave me
which I just thought was so so cute and
chic and amazing and I was super
thrilled about it so it's just like this
light wash denim jacket but it fits so
nicely and it's such good quality also
they gave me some workout clothes and
this has come perfect in time because I
have just started working out like
seriously working out like I can't not
work out anymore I went for like ten
months just like through a growth stage
where I just like didn't want to work
out didn't care to eat healthy and I
gained weight like I'm a small person as
you can see but I did put on weight for
myself and then I like wasn't happy with
how I was looking so I've been working
out a lot and I've been watching what I
eat a lot more lately and a Calvin Klein
gave me these tickets workout pants they
gave me two pairs and um just a nice
little black pair and these are like
pretty short and these are like a little
longer but both pretty much ones like
right after the knee and ones like a
little bit longer common Klein also got
me this bra like this sports bra which
was like the dopest thing ever I'm going
to SoulCycle after this um so I'm gonna
wear this but I love this sports bra and
then they also gave me a bunch of their
just bras so I got this in like black
white blue um grey got some orange
underwear on like cool colors in that so
that was super epic a line also gave me
some shoes which say Calvin Klein and I
don't know they're so comfortable and so
cool everybody was wearing these I
VidCon like when they got them from
Calvin so love that boom and then I also
gifted me like this super comfy sweater
and who literally doesn't live in a nice
comfy Calvin sweatshirt if you have the
opportunity like totally took them up on
it
give me that okay so now I'm going to
show you a couple of waiting suits that
disclaimer they are not cheap they are
not cheap I repeat they are not
affordable I want to show you them in
case people are saving up and want one
of these or just like looking at stuff
and maybe setting a goal one day to get
them their selves I particular throat um
but this isn't meant to brag you guys
know that I just love sharing clothing
that's what I came on here to do so I'm
like being in fashion so I think you
know the point you're gonna hate you can
okay so the first one is let me give you
a little back story as to why I got so
many bathing suits
um what is happening that's really
classy um so basically I have grown the
past couple of years and I have not
bought any new bathing suits like I just
don't buy new bathing suits and I really
don't know why but I never buy a new
bathing suits like I tell you I never
buy any bathing suits so I pretty much
realized one day that I didn't have any
bathing suits that fit my chest area if
you know what I mean so I had to buy new
bathing suits and then I loved matching
bathing suits so I bought the bottoms
where is this from this is by this brand
called vitamin A and it's just like this
really fun bright pink like bright pink
neon bathing suit kind of looks orange
in the camera but it's not and then the
back is like this so I love this so much
and I got the matching bottoms that look
like this this and then this they are
like all my bottoms are pretty full
coverage in the boot a number one
because I bought them with my mom so I'm
not gonna like have bathing suits just
go right at my ass but a virgin who is
because I don't really love the bathing
suits like they look good on other
people but I don't know just feel a
little bit more covered and confident
especially because since I do have like
a bigger boob area I like a lot I can't
control it but like it tends to show
there so I don't want to have like
cleavage and then like also my butt out
I'm just trying to you know manage my
scandalous bathing suit time this next
one is by Elle space this is probably
one of my favorite ones that I got and
it's just this really nice
white and then tan around here and then
the back goes like this so it goes
around your back that way and then I
also got the matching bottoms which look
like this and then they have like some
nice little cross string right there as
you can see and also what's cool about
these bottoms is they are reversible
they have like the little sticker in it
so but they are reversible so they can
become a nude color but I probably
wouldn't wear new just because it looks
like you're naked so unless I got really
really tan and it just looked like a
really pretty nude on me I probably
couldn't pull off the whole nude
situation I got another one from Elle
space I'll start with the bottoms the
bottoms look like this they are again
full coverage you know the drill they
just look like this and they're this
really nice navy and then this little
nude and white part and then on the top
it also has this part right here it's
navy and then the back is my favorite
part just looks can you see what I mean
yeah just looks like that a little bit
so I think that was so I thought that
was really cool and what I love about
this also is it is reversible so it can
also become like this in the back and
then this nice blue color and the
bottoms are also reversible so it can do
the exact same thing and become a really
awesome blue and then the sides are just
fully blue like that I'm going to lastly
finish it off with my favorite bathing
suit of all time and I never even knew
this brand before I never heard of it I
just taught in a Swim Shop and it's
called Lisa Marie and Lisa Marie
Fernandez that was my old computer
teacher's name is Fernandez anyway I'm
gonna garden um okay so this bathing
suit is my favorite thing I've ever seen
in my whole entire life I just have no
words for it so it's just this amazing
one-piece like how I just think it's so
classy and like look so high-fashion and
I think it would look so cute with the
hat I'm wearing like
I can't even do it's just this like kind
of you guys can see it's just one piece
and then it has two little ropes right
here that tie and kind of like cinches
your waist together it covers your butt
perfectly but still like it's not too
full coverage so you don't look like so
it's still like kind of flattering where
you can see like you have AB up there
and then also it just kind of fits your
boobs like sorry that sounds weird oh no
it fits them perfectly it just like goes
on so nicely so love that bathing suit
it's my favorite thing I've ever have in
my whole entire wardrobe I will
literally try and keep that too I'm Way
older like I love it so much so yeah
that completes for this little clothing
haul not a little pretty big but I hope
you guys enjoyed my pretty much I think
glass summer clothing well unless I
squeeze one more in but I will probably
the next hole you'll see as a back to
school haul so thanks for watching I
love you guys and I will see you guys
Wednesday because today's Monday because
I didn't post Sunday but at all it's
going to work out because I'll see you
