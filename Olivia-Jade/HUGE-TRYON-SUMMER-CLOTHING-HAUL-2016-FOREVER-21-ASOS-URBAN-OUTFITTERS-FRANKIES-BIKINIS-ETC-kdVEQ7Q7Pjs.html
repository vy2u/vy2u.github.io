gotta nananana what the hell hey guys
welcome back to my channel today I am
doing a collective clothing haul for you
I am so excited to film this you have no
idea I have been ordering so much stuff
to my house because I want I wanted to
film this video I'm not trying to brag I
feel like I have to say that in clothing
haul sometimes because I don't want
people to feel like oh look what I got
ha ha like no way I just want you guys
this is a very requested video and I
just want to put out what you guys want
to see and I also love watching clothing
hauls and the bonus with this video is
it is a Tryon house you can see
everything on before you purchase it but
anyway enough of me you know talking
about nothing let's get into the
clothing haul okay so the first place I
went shopping was forever 21
I love forever 21 it is affordable it's
cute and it's comfortable and it's not
like the ultimate best quality but like
the shipping is good you know the return
policy is like not that great online
shopping but so this is a trout haul as
I said you can see me in it but I'm just
going to show you the piece before I
show myself in it if that makes sense
so first I'm going to start with this
sweatshirt basically I picked up this
really big pink sweatshirt and I liked
the color because although it's I feel
like these kind of nude pink sand like
tans are in right now so I've been
wanting a really oversized hoodie
sweatshirt and I could not find that
anywhere um I just really really would
have been like looking for a good hoodie
by the way this is $45 so it wasn't it
like like out-of-this-world expensive
but it wasn't cheap like forever 21
usually is but I don't know if it has
something to do with that I ordered it
in the men's section and I just got it
in a size medium so it's like super big
then from from
everyone you know sometimes I'm like hmm
or forever21 will kind of have like an
expensive line I was looking at it not
like crazy out-of-this-world expensive
but you know like not like 10 or 15
dollars it's like 60 or 70 dollars I was
looking at that and just kind of like
looking around and with summertime
coming up I've been wanting like a kind
of sheer lacy set and then it comes with
this really pretty matching long maxi
skirt I think this would be so cute to
just throw over a bathing suit like for
dinner time it's like cute and classy
and fancy but it's also just super easy
by the way everything I'm talking about
will be linked down below in the
description ok now I'm going to have to
like the cheaper stuff from forever 21
I'm gonna start out with this really
cute bodysuit I just got this bodysuit
and it just looks like this I think it'd
be really cute with shorts or um
high-waisted jeans in the summertime it
is so cute I love the pattern I love the
color
Halla it has it gone gone with it
breaking have little buttons so you
don't have to undo okay does it unbutton
yeah I have little buttons so you don't
have to undo the whole entire thing when
you have to go to the bathroom because
that is the most annoying thing ever
next from forever 21 I got this long
gray dress it just is like a big tank
top t-shirt dress and this probably
wasn't too expensive yeah this is $12
and I think it's just really cute for
the summer to throw over a bathing suit
or just to like wear out with like some
like wrap up sandals I don't know don't
really know how I feel about this as you
guys can probably tell I'm not like a
huge color person so this was a little
bit of a comfort zone it looks like that
um and it has like these little tassels
hanging down it's really cute and I
think would look cute on a lot of people
I just don't know how I feel about red
on me we'll see if I like it I don't
know what I wear it with I don't know if
it fits correctly I haven't tried any of
this stuff on yet well when you're
watching this I will have tried a combo
yeah next I have this really tiny top um
it looks like it could be for a four
year old from forever 21 I didn't expect
it to be so small so I kind of just wear
it to sleep and that's basically how
I've been wearing it I'm definitely just
going to wear it in the summer with like
high-waisted shorts and you know like I
don't even know what bra you wear with
this and then I got this really oh this
has the price tag on 14 dollars it's not
bad I got this really deep cut v-neck
and it's just gray as you can tell and
it's just like a normal t-shirt it's not
Kraft or anything but it's a really low
cut so either what I want to do with
that is I want to stick like a lacy bra
under it so that's like kind of peeking
out and I think that'll look really
pretty also bought I love this and it's
colored but it's like that light nudish
pink so it just looks like this it's
just a cute little t-shirt and then the
back is like vegan you know I'm saying I
got this gray shirt just this tank I can
tell I just got like really basic pieces
that are just going to be good to throw
over a bathing suit or just something
like shorts or something really casual
in the summer and then lastly from
forever 21 I got this adorable
um off-the-shoulder crop top I'm really
into off the shoulders right now I think
it's very sexy and feminine and girly
but the thing with this is I'm usually a
size small or extra small and shirts and
everything I got this in a large this
runs super tiny a small would probably
be for a three-year-old child got some
really cute things from ASOS before you
guys tell me that is not some more
clothing this is collective as I've been
saying and I still got this in the
spring so like I probably should have
been ordering like big bulky sweaters
but I just lost waters and I don't have
that many sweaters are things first I'm
going to show you some jeans I got from
ASOS these are just black high-waisted
denim jeans and then they have rips in
the knees you guys have seen these
probably everywhere they're super
popular I also bought this really nice
kind of like light it's like a great
light gray with like a little blue
undertone
um it's just like this really nice knit
sweater I wanted it to be a little
bigger just because I love big big
sweaters but it's cute and it's really
comfy and Mormon
I bought this adorable this is my
all-time favorite thing it gets sold out
so much it's like this massive big gray
sweater that goes down to your ankles it
is everything I've been looking for I've
been wanting just a big gray long
sweater this is the exact thing that I
wanted it fits adorably it is so
comfortable and it's so cute I am
obsessed and that's everything I got
from ASOS next I believe I got these
both from Urban Outfitters um but if I
didn't because I don't remember anything
this is from the Brit coat anyway I just
got this hat um I think this is super in
for summer and just it's even in for
winter whatever you want to wear it
these hats are just really in right now
and then I also got this big floppy hat
this is like my favorite thing ever I
think it's so cute so I love both my
hats I'm like so obsessed with them I
love love big hats like this
moving on to Topshop I got two pairs of
jeans first pair are these ripped gray
jeans I think they're so adorable and
they're super tomboy and they are called
the Topshop moto hatin um and then these
are the Topshop moto mom jeans and what
I love about these is that they have
patches on them and then these are shoes
from saludos um they have really cute
little espadrilles and I got these ones
they kind of have like a jean fabric
here and then there's little popsicles
on them so I think those are adorable
they're super super comfortable and then
lastly to finish off my haul I am going
to show you a couple bathing suits that
I bought first I'm gonna show you one
that I bought off Franky's bikinis it's
like this mango color and then the back
looks like this
then I got the matching bottoms which
just look like this okay next I got this
really adorable bathing suit from one of
my new favorite bathing suit companies
and I don't have pronounced it it felt
like bad um it's French think I love
these bottoms they are just like this
teal and then pink um and then the back
is super cute and then I also got this
striped one and I will have a picture of
it right here because it's in the wash
because I wore it and it literally fits
like a gem
I'm obsessed lastly from Frankie's I got
this one piece it's like a nice floral
ish pattern man that has like this big
mmm messy see-through part you can like
see my fingers you know I wish it was
reversible because oh wait it is oh wow
oh no stop Oh guys that would be so cool
though they should relate Frankie's if
you're watching
she needs if you're watching you should
really make it reversible because that's
so much cuter darn love this side too
it's very cute
I love it that pretty much concludes it
