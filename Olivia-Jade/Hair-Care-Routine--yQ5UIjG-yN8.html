huh I got red lipstick on it hey guys
it's Olivia and welcome back to my
channel today I filmed a haircare
routine so if you guys do want to watch
it please just enjoy and keep watching
obviously and let me know down below
what you think after the video is over
or you can just tell me before even
though you wouldn't have watched it I
hope you enjoy this video and if you
guys do want to see my hair care routine
then just keep watching so first let's
start with shampoo and conditioner and I
use the organics renewing argan oil of
Morocco shampoo and the conditioner to
it it smells so nice it smells like a
fresh flower or fresh perfume something
so amazing I can't even explain it I
both of these the shampoo I obviously
use first and then I follow up with the
conditioner
oh that's backwards and I follow up with
the conditioner and they smell amazing
they work so well for me I feel like all
conditioner pretty much makes my hair
soft at least all the ones I've ever
used in my life I don't really notice
the biggest difference with conditioner
but I actually do notice a difference
with this one it makes it a lot smoother
and softer and it gives it a really
silky like shine effect after you use it
it says a unique precious blend of argan
oil of Morocco which instantly
penetrates the hair shaft restoring
shine of softness while strengthening
and creating soft seductive silky
perfection I used those and then I also
use the tres may used by professionals
conditioner just the normal one and I
love this it smells let's see Oh smells
like a tres my product because it is
just my product but they all have that
set you know if you haven't used trust
me you have no idea what I'm talking
about I can't describe it you guys just
going to ride a torn open one and smell
and then you can decide I believe this
is less expensive and it is a huge
bottle I go through conditioner like no
other you know how you're supposed to
music a small amount of conditioner I
just take like a handfuls and then just
rub it through my hair
I am already down to here with this
bottle so it's a little bit unnecessary
and crazy but I believe this is not too
crazy expensive especially for how good
this is I'm not sure how much it is so
it could be like a lot of money and I'm
just saying like it's not that expensive
and then you guys look and it's like
thirty dollars should we look it up
let's look it up try some a conditioner
okay okay or autograph contact that's
right I thought I'm so wrong for it's
six dollars that is great okay so this
is why I bought that clearly because
it's a great price there's so much of it
I wasted six dollars on Amazon you guys
I'm awarding so many of these on Amazon
and I have an Amazon gift card I'm about
to get so many of these for free right
now
oh yeah usually almost everyday use that
it's a 10 miracle leave-in product it
smell all my hair stuff smells good okay
let me just put that out there I never
use crappy smelling hair stuff because
why why would I do that
but this also comes in a smaller bottle
which is less expensive and the smaller
bottle you can use it for oh go ahead it
lasts a super long time this is the
bigger version of the smaller bottle so
I suggest if you haven't tried this
definitely try the smaller bottle first
it number one repairs dry damaged hair
number two at shine
3G tangles four controls frizz five
seals and protects hair color six
prevents split ends seven stops hair
breakage eight create silkiness nine
enhances natural body 10 Flatiron spray
and thermal protection
oh my god my my bed covered my sheets
are so dirty because I took my dog out
last night I like 10:30 because shedding
on the bathroom or I don't know if she
did but I let her out and it will she
didn't actually because she acted that
she did it and then when she got out
there she started running around the
yard and wanted me to play fetch with
her so then I played fetch with her for
a little while and then I brought her up
to my room gave her some water
and then let her sleep in my bed with me
and she got her little muddy paw prints
all over my covers and my sheets and
stuff so
Bianca Faria things that I also use out
of the shower sometimes this is the
L'Oreal professional texture experts to
move the lower smoothing lotion product
I think I mentioned this in a favorites
video and if I didn't well this is like
a little shout out to you because you're
definitely my favorites video now or my
hair care routine video but like I'm
pretty sure I use this in a favorites
video put this in your after you shower
and then you blow-dry it and it leaves
like such a beautiful shine and it's so
soft I can't even explain it it's the
best thing I've ever used I even use
this when I don't blow dry my hair cuz I
never budge on my hair or shave my hair
I just don't care to I just let it air
dry and I find different products to
make it look good because first I'm lazy
second my hair is too thick and I don't
have that much patience so I almost did
a third one but then I just realized I
only had two so that's cool it's L'Oreal
so I'm sure you can get it I mean I know
you can get it on Amazon online anywhere
and probably no promises but probably in
Target or a drugstore okay something I
recently got this is my Tresemme used by
professionals perfectly undone with sea
kelp extract wave creation sea foam this
is what I used on my hair I basically I
got this like two days ago and I used it
on my hair after the shower and it
leaves tired with these natural waves
and it is so crazy I never thought a
phone could like leave your hair like
that I thought you always had to you can
always touch it up and curl up but guys
this is like it left like a natural wave
and like a really natural shine as it
leaves your hair shiny and it looks like
a watery liquid from the bottle there
but then when you take it out on your
hand its phone it's so cool okay I don't
know what I'm gonna do with that now mm
sometimes Olivia doesn't make the
smartest decisions
be honest I just rubbed it on my leg and
put some back in the cat
what kind of stings my leg I've Heim you
look at the hand lotion that's not how
it supposed to be it doesn't smell like
that Saffy coconutty lovey-dovey
Christmassy candle cinnamon frosty smell
it's summer it's not summer it's like
fresh and beautiful and flowery I like
the summer smell more than the winter
smell if you ask me I really don't like
the sentiment of the coconutty and
that's the warm chocolatey I really
enough and lastly for product I use the
Tresemme thermal creations hair
protection heat tamer leave and spray
this I just use it before I use heat on
my hair and you spray from like six to
eight inches away from mid-shaft to ends
I have no idea what that means but I'm
an act like I do so you can use this
before you blow dry our hair and then
before you use your flat iron or
straightener than you use this again on
your dry hair so yeah this protects your
hair prevents split ends from heat and
damage and it's great and I and I don't
notice a difference because I don't use
heat too much but this I felt needed to
be included because if I were to use
heat I would use a heat protectant and
now I'm just going to come and talk
about the different brushes and combs I
use because if you want to know you can
or you can click on this video of your
board first I have a card air comb which
is just a wide tooth comb I totally made
that up I don't even know it's just a
wide pick white choose wide comb wide
tooth comb I think that's what it's
called regardless of what it's called I
never use it anyway I think that after I
got out of the shower I'm gonna be good
I'm not gonna brush to my hair I'm gonna
comb through my hair but that just never
happens so so that's cool it's just my
hair's too long and I can't just keep up
with just the combing and the
naughtiness of it I just need a brush so
I have that but I don't use it but I
will start because I feel like I should
now I also have this Conair pink one
with a lot of hair
out of it which is disgusting I usually
use this when I can't find the brush
them about to show you I have a lot of
brushes a because I really like brushing
my hair and B because I lose all my
brushes very quickly so they're just
like in my shower and then I take them
out to brush my hair and then I'm
showering the next day and I noticed
that my hairbrush is gone and then it
will come back the next day I swear it
has legs and it runs away from me when I
need it I use that as a backup brush and
then this is my main brush also from
Cohen air I guess I only buy hair
brushes from Conair there's so much
easier to use they're so big and they
just get way more chunks and parts of
your hair and they are amazed if you
have long thick hair like I do you can
relate to me right now like this is just
a must if you have long and thick hair
and you don't have this brush I don't
know how you brush your hair girl that
is so more guy guys might watch my
videos with blonde hair - oh thank you
guys all so much for watching and I hope
you all enjoy and don't see my next one
