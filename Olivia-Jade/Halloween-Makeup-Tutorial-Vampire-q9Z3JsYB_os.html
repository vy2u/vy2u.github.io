am doing this tutorial because I think
that is less than a week or maybe over a
week I don't know what the date is to
Halloween less than week I'm pretty sure
and I went to a Halloween party last
night and it's kind of got me thinking
that I haven't done any tutorials for
Halloween and I really haven't done many
makeup tutorials which is what my
channel was originally supposed to be if
you guys want to see more makeup
tutorials then please give this a thumbs
up so I know and so calm down below you
would like to see in other videos so the
first thing that I'm starting out with
is foundation because when you're doing
a look like this that's very harsh and
you want it to be very dramatic you want
people to focus on what's supposed to be
dramatic which in this case is a vampire
look so I'm going to focus out more on
my eyes and lips so I'm eating to have
like a flawless base or just something
that just covers up all the
discoloration so I'm using my favorite
foundation which is the L'Oreal True
Match Lumi in c4 and I'm just going to
be applying that with the multitask
brush I'm just applying it straight to
the brush and then I'm going to be
looking my viewfinder because I'm kind
of using that as a mirror so just
starting it out the cheeks
that's the foundation done I'm going to
go in with my favorite concealer which
I've used in other videos with the
concealer I've just covered up like
things I want to hide this may be way
too much makeup for you for this look I
feel like you really really need a
flawless base so that's why I'm putting
so much on as you can see after you're
done with the foundation and concealer
you want to set it with a mattifying
powder kids unless you like the oil oil
look so I'm just studying it with the
stay matte powder in 0:04 sandstorm and
then with a real techniques setting
brush
maybe not same powder I'm just didn't
use it with my big Brush cause it's
harder to focus it in those areas where
we applied concealer because there's
kind of small and then after we're done
with the face I'm gonna go start with
the eye and I'm actually starting out
with my eyeliner I'm just starting with
down here so I've just dropped my eye
nerd down and then I made a little tip
up here in the corner and I'm going to
be bringing it this way basically got to
have looks I did not try to make it
perfect or neat or anything I just kind
of smudged it on it and then I'm just
going to go on and do the next eye and
then I'll tell you what to do next
after I've done that you can see it is
super messy I like I try to do super
straight line I can too perfect so I'm
going to be using the color from this
elf blush palette in a dark and I'm
going to be using this color just taking
that on a real techniques domed shadow
brush and then just applying this color
into the crease good I'm bringing this
throughout the whole crease and bring it
down to my cheek twig or not my cheek
inodes on the contours of my nose to
make me look a little more sick and
tired spring the leftovers up to my brow
bone I'm using this little pencil brush
by Mac I'm just going to take a matte
black eyeshadow I'm just putting this
matte black in the outer third of our
crease and then I'm just going to take
that matte red me first to use and there
still should be a little black on your
pencil and then to make this look even
more sick and tired and really vampire
light we're just going to bring it down
to the lower lash line you can play this
up even more with a couple coats of
mascara which is what I'm going to do so
you're just brushing my eyebrows back
like this kind of deciding the shape I
want and then with the fill inside I'm
not doing anything special I'm just
filling in the sparse spots I'm taking
the blush we've been using the whole
time from the elf blush palette in dark
with this small stipple brush from ELF
and just taking that color I'm going to
be applying it as a contour so after I
do that I'm not I'm not going easy as
you can see I've gone very harsh digging
this little bronzer here with just the
same brush and I'm just going over it
with a brown if you want to use black
you can I just want black is super hard
to work with and blend
and it's just very hard so I'm just
going in with the bronzer putting this
on my forehead literally just make
yourself super red and gross so now for
the best part it's mostly the lips and
what I'm doing first is taking the
eyeliner that I used in the beginning
and just kind of drawing on the outer
edge and then I'm just going in with a
red lip and just filling that in in the
middle in between the black parts I
thought we filled in good up over them
okay and then after you're done with
that you are just going to take the
black liner and you're just going to
draw where you want blood coming out
so with that red lipstick you're just
going to draw over where you put those
black lines and then to make it look
kind of more bloody and liquidy and grow
so I'm taking a lip gloss if you have
fake blood that would be ideal that's
the best thing but since I don't
this is just as fine thank you so much
for watching I hope you guys all enjoyed
this look please comment down below what
other looks you'd like to see so I can
maybe squeeze in one more holiday
