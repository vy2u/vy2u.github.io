another video if you're new here
I'm Olivia J you should subscribe i am
doing a personal Q&amp;amp;A today
you guys have like 10 questions that I
constantly get tweets about and then
they're always followed by like if it's
too personal you don't have to answer so
I just thought I would do a little video
I tweeted out using the hashtag ask
Olivia cheney and yeah so I just thought
I would screenshot the ones that I
thought I could have good advice about
or something I've been through or
something just personal in my life that
you guys want to know alright so let's
get started with the first question the
one that I get a ton of questions and
Instagram comments and everything about
which was might be too personal but why
did you and Tyler breakup so obviously I
made my relationship a little bit public
with doing like the boyfriend tag and
all that type of stuff which is no
longer on my channel just because my ex
isn't really the type that likes to be
like on social media which I really
respect about him so when we parted ways
I took down that video just to like
respect his privacy I feel like everyone
wants to hear like some juicy answer
behind this and it's nothing except the
fact that we were in two different
places at different times I still have
the most love for him in the world
that's probably what makes it harder
like the whole breakup but he goes to
college in a different state so it just
wasn't working since I'm in LA and then
he was in a different state so basically
just long-distance got the best of us
next question is what was your biggest
regret in middle school love you so I'm
assuming someone in middle school a
penis and the reason I decided to put
this in is because when I look back at
middle school I cringe literally I
cringe to death thinking about the
things I did and said and who I was as a
person in middle school but it's also a
part of being 12 years old and just
saying stupid stuff and getting away
with it I used to try and get all my
crushes well I had one crash in middle
school and shout out to you Keller and I
would try and get Keller to like fight
me over stupid stuff and that's one
thing I probably regret middle school in
middle school I just regret caring about
what other people thought about me I
changed this elementary school that's
when that whole thing with down where I
was like instigating stuff when I was
like 12
what's middle school 7th and 8th grade
and in high school is ninth through
senior year I don't remember I guess
it's all kind of like the same age so
just like being involved in drama and
just be nice to everyone
it'll get you so much farther in life do
you like being single or would you
rather be in a relationship um she's
gonna make myself comfortable kidding
so sometimes I like being single because
I have a bunch of really great
girlfriends and we like going out and
just being wild child's wild children
know in that way actually but we just
like like going out and like having fun
and I like not having to worry about
like another person obviously like being
in a relationship is really fun because
you've something to talk to all the time
and I'm such a relationship girl like I
don't get around with like a bunch of
different guys I am pretty reserved and
picky I guess so yeah I think I like
being single right now but I am a
relationship girl what's the best part
and worst part of having a famous mom
and please don't say it's so normal and
not you don't feel any different cuz
let's be real
oh and then this question I feel like
those hand-in-hand with it it says how
do you handle constantly being in the
public eye as the daughter of two very
well-known individuals so I'm gonna just
mash those two questions together
basically a lot of people always ask me
like famous parents growing up in like a
famous family whatever I never think
anything of it I I know I always say
that but it's the truth I really don't I
think there are different aspects and
like worrying about your friends when
you're like six years old like everyone
I was like six seven eight years old I
would always think about like oh do they
want to be my friend for me or like my
mom and my dad or like whatever you know
what I mean so I think like that's
probably not normal thoughts a six year
old seven year old eight year old child
would have but it's definitely something
I remember I used to play soccer when I
was little and there was this girl and
my sister's soccer team that kept I
don't know she just gave me the vibe she
want to be my sister's friend and my
friend because of our mom and I just
remember like when I was like eight
years old I was like red flag so I feel
like it's almost a blessing like I can
tell who actually
my friend which is cool and it preps me
well for now what I do so I can like see
who's genuine and then a lot of you if
you don't know this if you're new to my
channel or if you just never knew this
my dad is a fashion designer he's
massive I love his name
awesome so badass but Massimo he's not
smile and he greeted the clothing line
Massimo that's in target I always make
jokes I'm like who whose name is Massimo
that is like so weird love you dad
I actually don't think his name is weird
I love the name of snow but anyway carry
on how do you avoid the pressure of
having sex I feel as though I'm not
ready but want to get it over with so
I'm not being constantly teased about
okay I don't think it's something that
you should just get it over with so like
people will leave you alone I don't
think there should be any pressure
because everyone's different so
everyone's gonna be ready at different
times you just need to do what's best
for you and when you feel comfortable
because it is something you only get
once so why would you want to ruin that
because of pressure from friends or
peers or whatever that sounds horrible
someone said what's the weirdest place
you've made out with someone
I don't like hook up with people in like
weird places I don't think tips for new
youtubers that feel like giving up
because they aren't growing and are
comparing themselves to others so I
wanted to include this question as it's
not really a personal question about me
but it's something I do get a lot I
wanted to answer for you guys because
I've been there and every other youtuber
that you watch and that's your favorite
and has also been there I can almost
guarantee it no one starts out with a
million subscribers no one starts out
with a hundred thousand no one even
starts out with ten subscribers you
start from zero you have to work
yourself up that way so if it's
something you're passionate about and
something you actually like doing and
you're not doing it to get famous or
like whatever become an influencer or
make this your job if you're actually
doing it because you like doing it I
think you're gonna get really far and
you just have to be persistent and tell
yourself like okay like I'm doing this
because I like it and also I feel like
what I started I never really thought
about how am I going to become famous
how am I gonna get like I was just doing
videos because I really liked doing
videos and then people started
subscribing and then I was like oh
like this is kind of cool this could be
something but it was never like oh my
god I mean
amount of followers like you can't
compare yourself because if it's
something you just are doing for a hobby
like that's your hobby it's not like
every kid that plays a sport is like
what happens if I don't go to college
greater like become a professional like
some people just do it because they like
it so I feel like YouTube's kind of the
same thing it's a hobby it was my
passion I just happened to take off it
happens to take off for a lot of people
and I feel like the people that grow the
most are the ones that do it because
they love it not because they want to be
famous ask Olivia Jade are you seeing
anyone
slash in a relationship I am definitely
not in a relationship with anyone I have
made a little pact to myself this year
that I just want to do my thing work on
myself yeah I talked to guys yeah I have
fun but I'm not like tying myself down
what's a life experience you have that
you feel really helped you to grow and
learn about yourself / taught you an
important lesson about life so I really
want to talk about this because I feel
like it's a really great question and
it's really important and it's something
I could maybe give some good advice
about just in high school friendships
and stuff like that I made so many
mistakes when I was 14 to like 16 years
old and then when I was about from 16 to
18 I really like figured it out like I
really understood how to work on myself
and how to become a better friend
because before that I've always had the
best interest for my friends have always
been obsessed with making sure my
friends are okay I love my friends more
than anyone but I was also like what I
did was the right way and I wasn't
really open to hearing anybody else's
ways of change and I think that that's
crazy
first of all everyone needs to be able
to change and be able to accept change
and listen to change being an open ear
not being judgmental giving the best
advice you could give honestly just
being kind and just not engaging in any
gossip ever like I know I say that all
the time on my channel but if I could
give any of you guys advice and I know
most of you are probably younger ish
girls don't talk badly about anyone ever
like even if you do it now to stop just
you're done and try it for two months
just try if you're like me
not gossip and negative energy just do
my challenge I'm challenging you if you
watch my videos and you like me a little
bit please listen just I'm telling you
to be nice to everyone to include people
and to not talk bad about anyone for two
months see what happens how do you talk
to boys like for real this sounds
childish but I'm always like shaking and
can't form a proper sentence when I'm in
the conversation and then I hate myself
later this is cute girl we've all been
there and it's totally fine you don't
have to hate yourself you can look at it
and laugh and be like oh my god what did
I just do
um but I think the way to talk to boys
is be yourself I know that's so cliche
and probably not helpful but you could
even just do like hi like how are you
like what I don't even know I know I
don't know how to talk to boys either no
I feel like it just kind of happens
naturally like you become friends with
them first I think the best thing to do
is like don't ever think about it like
oh my god this boy is really cute I'm
gonna go talk to him and hope for the
best like always you're kind of go with
the approach like I just couldn't to be
friends with them and like if we connect
and we have like good chemistry like our
conversation will happen naturally you
just kind of think about like whole
situations like well he could just be my
friend let's see what happens you're
gonna be way more calm how do you deal
with bad friends do you ever feel
antisocial and don't want to go to
parties with bad friends I cut them out
by you ever feel antisocial and not what
a good parties actually don't I really
like going to parties and I really like
being social but I guess when I was a
little bit younger I hated doing all of
that I think just starting to say yes to
more things and getting out of the house
and you meet so many more people that
way and you make so many great friends
that way that it's so worth it in the
end
give yourself a chance to be social and
like go to parties and do stupid stuff
in high school not too stupid because
you have to be safe it's the year of
Yolo people that's what I've been
telling all my friends tell my sister
this everyday is Sierra Yolo CH well
have you ever gotten annoyed at a fan I
remember when you got mobbed at USC so
that must have been a little
disheartening I've never been annoyed at
a fan ever I get really excited when I
meet subscribers with fans if you will
um so no I haven't gotten annoyed
see when I got mop that wasn't annoying
to me that was fun and funny and
exciting I was like there's so much
adrenaline and those like game day but
ya know I really don't get annoyed and I
love you guys so if you ever see me
please say hi I hate when people look at
me and then don't say hi and I and we
know we both know what's going on but
they're too shy because I don't want to
approach someone if I think or assume
because if it's a wrong assumption I'd
be super embarrassing how do you deal
with the break-up yes I love you I love
you too I think if you're breaking up
with someone that you need to literally
just cut the cord
don't do the half-ass like oh we're
gonna talk or you're not gonna be
together but we're so gonna talk that
makes stuff so much harder and I did
that for a really long time and I think
it's so hard when you care about someone
so much and love them so much to fully
let go but if you're actually serious
about breaking up and moving on you just
need to actually do it and move on and
whether that's for you on following on
social media so you don't just either
stuff anymore maybe like deleting their
contact so you don't feel pressured or
like the need to text them I don't know
whatever works for you everyone's
different obviously but I think that if
you're breaking up with someone you need
to go full peace-out mode but don't be
the girl that's waiting around or the
guy that's waiting around for your
significant other to realize what
they've lost you are so much better than
that
I promise you we'll get through it I've
been there a bunch of other people have
been there the best thing you can do is
honestly just really keep yourself busy
in the beginning at least like keep
yourself busy with friends and talk to
new boys get out there have fun I mean
obviously not right away when you're
ready but I think the most amazing thing
about my first relationship ever I can't
speak on anybody else but for me
personally I know that I have obviously
zero regrets in anything I ever did when
I was dating my ex he was the best
boyfriend ever literally in the world
like and that's what's so great now is
like I know it's
see how I should be treated and if
anyone treats me less than what I once
was treated I will know exactly that I
am so much better and I don't deserve
that and so I think that's what's so
cool instead of dwelling on a breakup
and looking at it like how do I get over
this look at it like that was such a
great experience and I learned so much
from it and now I know exactly how to be
treated or if you were in like a toxic
relationship you can look at it like
well look what I have to look forward to
so many guys out there or girls out
there that actually know how to treat me
so yeah that's like you may I look like
a big like bean I'm an egg or being
always but it's like thank you guys for
watching I love you I just wanted to
show out I was about to film a favorites
video like I'm looking at all my
favorite products right there and then I
was like no I don't want to I only have
like 5 to 10 products and I was like I
could do better I hope you guys like

up if you did and I'll see you in my
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
