today's video I'm going to show you how
to get this look I am so stuffed with
the glow it's perfect I'm so excited to
share little secret trick for you guys
basically I just want to show you
highlighting in three steps it's
basically the easiest thing in the world
so for those of you that are confused my
guys and girls that have no idea what
they're doing when highlighting I didn't
know what one what what even have any
was and now if you're like I can achieve
the most beautiful glow so thank you so
much to Sephora collection of her
working with me on this video you guys
know I love Sephora collection I worked
with them back in December so I'm very
excited to read partner up and there
will be many more partnerships
throughout the year that I'm very much
looking forward to Chuck enough of me
rambling on let's get started since I
already created this look I'm going to
take it off I'm going to be using my
Sephora collection coconut cleansing
wipes I'm recreating the look that I
have my face don't worry these are so
good they smell amazing
I know it's really important to wash
your face but this is something great to
keep in your bag just because you don't
have to rinse your face after using me
use it so just going to take off all my
makeup okay mom like very easy booty so
the first thing I'm going to do is start
with a little bit of primer on taking my
Becca backlit primer I believe yes
bacala priming filter because it's just
a really glowy highlight and obviously
for this video we are trying to glow to
the god I'm then I'm going to go on the
foundation it just mix a little bit on
the back of my hand I'm just using my
shoes makes Born This Way like normal
and I'm just going to kind of select it
on my face if it's a little bit lighter
so just going to match it to my neck
and they're not going to go in with a
little bit of my to fake words by
concealer and just going to light my
face up cuz it looks a little bit dark
alright so now for the easiest part I'm
going to show you how to highlight you
can basically do this three different
ways I'm going to show you all three
combined but all these also like alone
are absolutely gorgeous so you can cream
highlight you can powder highlight or
which you probably never heard them you
can spray highlight which I'll get into
a little bit later so basically if I'm
going to do all three of these I like to
go and order a cream spread and set the
whole thing with a powder I'm just going
to start with the cream highlighter I'm
going to be using the áfourá
collection dimensional highlighting
palette this is gorgeous it has so many
different beautiful shades that you can
like totally mix together to create kind
of like custom your own highlight on
your own inner glove you know what I'm
saying
they also come in two shades I have mine
is cool but they also come in warm I'm
going to start with cosmic glaze this is
kind of like a white pearl shimmer I'm
going to take this on a Sephora
collection 52 brush and I'm just going
to dip it in there and just highlight
the tops of my cheekbones
I'm very carefully going to place that
on the top and just kind of brush that
along just so it gives a really really
nice highlight it feels very very
lightweight so you don't have to worry
about it feeling sick or anything like
that and then you can also just keep
building it up for your desired amount
of highlight I'm going to go for just
one layer it's coming to the my nose a
little bit on
Nik and I think that's basically kind of
where I want to put it so after you have
that gorgeous flow you can check the
cream first part of the highlight author
list super easy super quick gives you of
course gorgeous glow I then move on to
step number two and I'm going to use a
spray highlight this is this before a
collection perfection mist news glow
this is basically a spray-on highlighter
which is like the coolest thing ever I
don't think you actually are made in
another brand so you first shake it up
I'm going to want to get it like six to
eight inches away from your face and
just spray so I'm going to just start
with the tops of my cheek bone oh my god
and it just gives like a very it kind of
just highlighted this whole part of my
face right here and just gives like a
very nice neutral sheen it is a
translucent base oh my god I'm lost
wrapped it up Mountain this is a
translucent base so it doesn't give
color but it kind of has like rose gold
pearl reflex I would say I just use a
little bit like that and it kind of
highlights this whole part of my face
how about for summertime it's the first
time I kind of like to highlight my
collarbone or shoulders so I would spray
a little bit on my shoulders in the
collarbone oh my god gorgeous after you
are done just kind of spraying it on the
places on highlight you can check the
step number two off your list once again
you can use all of these steps along so
if you just wanted to use this is your
man later go for it if you just want to
use the cream go for it or we just
wanted to use the powders go for it so
now I'm going to show you is if Sephora
collection
luminizing palette this isn't like
packaging illuminate gorgeous it has six
beautiful shades both made for pool and
warm tones so you don't have to worry
about finding the right shade palette to
have all the shapes in here for you I'm
probably going to use the two yellows
right here
these kind of yellowy goals because I
think that's going to look gorgeous I'm
going to take it on my Sephora
collection 204 brush
well double-sided brush one for
highlighting one for contouring can I
take that paper highlight side and just
place it over where I put that cream
highlight and it's going to pass this
over where I put oh my god literally
stepped it beautifully I just kind of
put that over where we were highlighting
before it kind of takes it from a very
gooey cream look to a gooey
it doesn't look powdery though it just
looks very natural and a lot of explain
it and a little on my nose to the zone
so that's going to be it for this video
I hope it looks super super helpful and
very easy for you to follow along I love
you very much and thank you for watching
and I'll see you guys next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
