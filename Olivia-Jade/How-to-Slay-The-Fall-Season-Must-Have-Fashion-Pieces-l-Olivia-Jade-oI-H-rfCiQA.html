back to another video on my youtube
channel I just kind of wanted to get
into like the fall season talk about
some pieces and products that I can't
live without
now that fall is approaching so I hope
you guys enjoy this video if you do make
sure to give it a thumbs up and
subscribe okay so first thing I want to
talk about are like little beauty
products just because I don't have that
many but these are a few things that I
literally cannot live without since I've
been like transitioning it to fall the
weather all that stuff
but number one my self tanner I use the
loving tan deluxe bronzing mousse in the
shade ultra dark and I can't live
without the mitt either they also have a
back applicator that I use when my
sister is in college or my mom's out of
town and they can't self-tan my back I
love keeping like the glowy dark skin
and this is the most beautiful
self-tanner what I love about this is
you really only need one layer since it
is in the shade ultra dark you don't
want to overdo it I actually have a
coupon code for loving tan I believe
it's just Olivia I think I'll find it
out and I'll put it right here on the
screen if you guys want I think if you
purchase a mousse if you use the code
you can get a free mitt and believe
that's how it works it doesn't benefit
me at all let's just help you guys it
since I love this brand and it's all I
use okay next I have been loving this
Laura Mercier at flawless skin infusion
de Rose norcia
oil basically you can put this on your
skin morning or night time and I just do
it when my face is a little bit damp
because that's what it says to do and it
just makes your skin feel like really
refreshed and alive and I think it gives
such a pretty glow to your skin so as
you guys know I'm all about like even my
skin looking healthy and glowy and all
that all that jazz so I've been really
obsessed with this and all of these
products will be linked down below in
the order I talked about them in case
you guys want to purchase anything of
course I got you speaking of glow I love
this Marc Jacobs do you do drops coconut
gel highlighter I literally mix this in
with my foundation every time I wear
foundation now and it just makes my
foundation look so glowy like I know
that's the only
I'm used for the past three products but
that's a huge theme that I've been going
for this fall it's just like having that
sunkissed look even though the Sun may
not be kissing you anymore you know what
I mean
do I need to talk about this because I
feel like sunscreen is one of the most
important things obviously to prevent
wrinkles but to keep your skin looking
really really beautiful and just like
healthy and I hate wearing sunscreen
because it's thick I feel like it smells
weird I feel like you're has like a
white cast on my face so I've really
been loving this glossier invisible
shield daily sunscreen it has SPF of 35
and it's like a gel consistency so it
doesn't even have color I hope it
actually works because it literally
doesn't feel like sunscreen at all it's
super lightweight and I just really
really enjoy it so I just smelled it
next another accessory sunglasses but
this in specific this cat eye shape has
been my favorite thing ever and it's
kind of like the only shape I feel like
looks decent on my face I have a really
hard time pulling off a bunch of
different sunglasses just been obsessed
with the cat eye these are by Spitfire
so I got these while ago I'll try and
link them down below if I can find them
still or if there's like a similar pair
because I really love like the good cat
eye shape okay so lastly for beauty
products this Origins
ginseng energy boosting gel moisturizer
is amazing I'm almost out of it because
I love it so much it just smells like
oranges first of all which is the best
scent in my opinion like if you don't
like oranges you're not gonna like this
but I love it smells like citrus and
orange isn't just like fresh and then it
just feels so so beautiful on your skin
and it makes you literally shine like
like a piece of gold like you just look
fabulous when you put this on sometimes
if I'm just like feeling really flat I
just put this on my skin feels a hundred
million times better and it looks better
and you just kind of like shine through
like you literally look just like
amazing so love this little hoop
earrings big hoop earrings I just love
hoops and I know that I'm gonna continue
to wear hoops and just crazy fun
earrings throughout the fall these ones
I believe are
PacSun I just picked them up and like a
set but I really like them because
they're kind of like the perfect size I
also love my big hoops as you can tell
um I don't know exactly where these ones
are from but I'll link hoops down below
that I think are really cute for you
guys because I think they're in right
now I think they're just fun and they
add something to a really basic outfit
so love that I want to move on to some
fashion favorites I'm going to start
with shoes first furry slides you guys
already know I'm obsessed with free
slides but these ones this color is
amazing these are by Gucci and I really
really really love this like mustard
yellow color for the Fall
they're so comfortable and I'm gonna
know for sold at Gucci yet I got them at
Elyse Walker in LA um but I love them
they're the velvet ones and I think
they're so stylish and cute and fun I
know they're a little bit pricey or so
really just fun free slides it's kind of
my point with this color in specific I
mean I just can't get enough of it I
love it it is sweater weather my love's
so this nice big comfy knit sweater is
forever 21
it's just cream it has like a little
high neck to it and these big sleeves
which I am obsessed with I actually
haven't worn this one yet but I'm just
obsessed with sweaters and then my
second sweater everyone was asking where
this sweater was from when I put it in
my first day of senior year vlog it is
from princess Polly I believe I have a
code at princess Polly it's love Olivia
and if you can get 20% off
I'm your whole purchase so I love you
there you go but I even used it when I
ordered my stuff because the sweater so
comfortable and so big and I got another
size medium I just wanted to go I'm
usually like an extra small or small in
tops and sweaters that I want to fit me
but I love oversized so I usually go for
like a women's medium just so it's like
super big and baggy okay I want to talk
about this pantsuit pajama suit kind of
thing I wore this to an event and it got
a lot of hype around it so I wanted to
pair or I wanted to show it in this
video it's from Zara and I think the
whole pajama trend is really in right
now I think this might be harder to wear
if you're maybe in high school or
college and you don't have something
like fancy to go to because it is
a little bit dressier but I think it's
fun and like the colors scream fall like
the orange II black green combination is
super super in season right now okay
let's go
with my favorite thing in the world
right now men's oversized t-shirts I
have one on right now I usually get them
from forever 21 because I think the
patterns are really fun like this
oversized orange tee I also have this
one and I also have this one I usually
got them in a size large medium I can't
wear as a dress I learned that the hard
way with one of the shirts so large is
the way to go I'm 5'4 it works great I
love love the man's t-shirt look like
literally I just wear this and sneakers
and I feel on top of the world I think
it's so stylish but so relaxed and a lot
of people think it's like super weird so
it's fine if you're one of those people
but I think it's so cool and so edgy and
I and it's easy like it's so comfortable
you can just be lazy so I kind of am
obsessed I always get questions when I
wear this hat and now I see a lot of
people wearing this specific hat lately
this is by lack of color and it's like
this I'm not saying they're winning it
because I was right now I'm just saying
I think it's like trending um it's just
like this really cute brown hat I love
it a lot it's like a color I've had it
for a little bit now and I think it's
just really stylish so I thought I would
throw it in there it's a perfect color
for fall like that kind of brownie
chocolate colors so the two tones really
cute and it really goes with anything
okay also I have this oversized denim
jacket I got this at the vintage
Reformation store on Melrose in LA but I
don't know where you can get this exact
one since it's vintage there's only one
of them or I think that's how that works
kind of situation but it is vintage Gap
denim so I thought that was cute it's
just like my favorite oversized
denim jacket and I think denim jackets
are so in I love the denim on denim
trend anytime I'm in a denim shirt or a
denim jacket and pants ooh
are you going a Canadian wedding thanks
that's really funny but I just like the
look also I've been obsessed with Levi's
jeans and I get them off with Shopbop
and they are my favorite jeans literally
in the world I have like eight pairs are
just ordered but these I think we're
like $99 or like 100 something and
they're just like these basic ones I
love this logo on the back it's so
iconic in the fashion world right now I
think it's just really comfortable and
cute and I think they're very flattering
on and they run true to size which is
like my biggest thing I'm a usually a
size 25 in jeans the 25 thing perfectly
so 10 out of 10 would recommend a good
pair of Levi's jeans I'm gonna link my
favorite ones down below they're kind of
like frayed at the end and I wear them
everywhere so those are the ones I'm
gonna link down below if you guys this
is just a good random paragraph but I
absolutely love that these pants I think
are really cool they're from forever 21
and I don't know these ones are still on
the website because I got them a while
ago
I think track pants are just really in
in general right now and I love these
ones they are just black and then they
have like the red and white stripes on
the side and they're forever 21 so they
were pretty affordable again I'm gonna
link a similar pair down below if these
ones are out of stock lastly I gotta
finish off with the best boot in the
whole entire world
haha I put these on my Instagram I think
we were literally freaking out about
that and they're from forever 21 there
are a little bit more expensive for
forever 21 I believe and they have them
in a really good mustard yellow color so
I was debating between this and the
yellow it's all linked both down below
but I think there's just fun I posted
them on Instagram people loved it
thought I would throw them in there for
the fall time I think high boots are
really cool
