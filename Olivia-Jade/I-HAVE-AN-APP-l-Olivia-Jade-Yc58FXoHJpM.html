in a hotel room you don't have your
equipment you don't have your lighting
this is the background you get I'm
really sorry I just got back from an
amazing day with Marc Jacobs I'm going
to the party they're throwing the party
later tonight featuring one my good
friends kaya so I'm going to do that
later but in the meantime I have a
little bit of time or the Sun might saw
I needed to come and sit down and film
at this video because it's something
that I have been so excited to tell you
about and if you follow me on Twitter
Instagram you know by now but I've never
announced this on YouTube so I think a
lot of you are going to be shocked and
surprised and of course the Sun Goes
Away right when I start to film well if
the Lighting's changing I'm sorry I
really can't control the bun home but
anyway today's video I'm so excited to
talk about my app I'm going to up with
the heck basically if you don't want to
get it it's not for everyone and I
understand that but it is something I
worked really hard on so I'm so excited
for those of you that do want more
exclusive content or more videos or has
been asking about blog posts or any of
that to get my app because all of that
is on my app there's a lot of stuff that
I haven't done on YouTube that I would
like to put somewhere but just YouTube
wasn't the right place for what I wanted
to do with it and then this opportunity
to make an app kind of felt my small lab
I've been working on it for about a year
but enough of me like kind of talking
about it I want to show you so the app
actually was secretly on the App Store
and hope you guys found it they were
like wait it's up early and I'm like oh
you guys are supposed to buy this yet my
laughs my inner corner is fully coming
off my app is called Olivia Jade and it
just has a little I'll show you guys it
just has a little photo of me right
there
once you download it and get it you can
see for yourself it is free on the App
Store and then there's a section what
drastic in the app that's called the VIP
section and it's for those of you that
want that exclusive content those blog
posts those extra videos those live chat
those whatever so that all comes like in
the VIP package I guess which there's
different types of board so I think if
it's you want a week of it just to test
it out
99 cents and then like six months
there's like a package that's supposed
to be a better deal if you know you're
going to like want to be around for six
months because there will be new content
and updating new stuff every single
basically month and there's going to be
so much new there's going to be so many
new videos on here blog posts all the
time you guys can kind of see what I've
been loving that I don't stick in a
video it's kind of more of just me
talking with you guys over a blog which
i think is amazing so basically this
part this page is just that we all can
talk this you don't have to pay for it
and when you go to the VIP section I
mean as time goes on the app may change
the format may change but right now it
looks like this and there's all this
really great stuff on here I think I've
worked really hard on it I have like
episodes with my friends for my VIP
members I have cooking with spell
episodes I have my workout routine I
have DIY lip scrub I have all these kind
of fashion-forward blog posts so it's
really exciting and can choose your own
decisions obviously I'm not forcing you
to buy it so I really don't want people
to be like oh she's we're doing this for
money because it's just not true at all
I'm doing this because it's another
place to put my content but because I am
working so hard and I am having to pay
other people to produce this content and
like help me fill my stuff since it's
just so much more work for is a
subscription part but I'm really excited
I hope you guys love the app as much as
I have left creating the content and
making it I have tried to tweak it and
make it so everything is perfect and
that I know my most loyal and amazing
subscribers are going to love it I love
you guys so much and I would love if you
tweeted me umm if you become VIP I will
be following all you guys to get my app
I will be DMing and following you of
course - I am just so so so please
please tweet me how you like it please
tweet me how you think it could improve
I'm so obviously this is the first
launch of my app so I am so needed it
and I'm so open to feedback and
constructive criticism of course so I'm
just having fun with it and I think it's
great because you guys can really see a
more personal side to me and we're still
trying to find that balance between
making my youtube videos and then my app
and I need to make sure like that
content is really really different so
it feels like you're not just paying for
something you can watch on YouTube like
it's more personal it's different things
so I'm really excited you guys can
always leave on the home page like where
the comment section is video ideas what
else you want to see and thank you so
much for watching if you guys download
it it means so much to me I really do
appreciate it I've worked long and hard
on it so yeah this was just a surprise
Thursday video kind of talking about my
app but I am so stoked I love you guys
so much and I hope you love me up bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
