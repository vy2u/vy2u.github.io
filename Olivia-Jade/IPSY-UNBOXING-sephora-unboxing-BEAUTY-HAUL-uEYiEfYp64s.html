breath I just ran downstairs
go and get these packages hi everybody
happy Wednesday if you guys are all
having an amazing day or night or
morning or whatever you're watching this
maybe starting a Wednesday when you're
watching this as you can tell by the
title of this video I am doing an Ipsy
unboxing haul so I did this last month
as well and the movie just stopped
recording a lot of you guys we're
tweeting about it to me so you guys
signed up for impsy and all that really
cool stuff which i think is awesome so
let's get into it I have not opened this
up yet
it came in like a little pink package
but somebody else took this part out but
I have not seen what's inside of this or
anything like that as you can see the
actual toilet rotates is different for
this month the last month's one was
black with hot pink and now we've got
this little fancy one so we're gonna
open it up and I'm just going to reach
in ooh the first thing I see is a Tarte
Park Avenue princess Amazonian clay
waterproof bronzer ooh
waterproof bronzer my sister might open
this up ah yes looks like it has a
little marks or it it's a golden brown
color as you can can you see that since
it's summertime you want to have that
sunkissed bronzy look this is going to
be perfect because it's waterproof and
it's such a beautiful bronzer it kind of
a shimmery which I love the next thing
we've got going is be a bombshell
French kiss lip balm it's like a pink
lip balm how does this turn it oh you
turn it at the bottom there you've got
this nice little lip balm I can't really
smell it I don't know that has a scent
or because I'm getting over a cold that
I can't smell it I'm really not sure
that's so cute I wonder if it moisturize
as well I'll follow up with this if you
guys want to know how it is and I'll let
you know the next is this eyeshadow and
highlighter bliss from Ofra literally
have no idea
this oh oh it's like a single pan just I
admit it I go is this magnetic and then
joins digging into my skin anyway this
is a height a high shadow this is a
highlighter and an eye shadow and that
is so pretty
can you see that let's see whoo it
doesn't have much product for a
highlight but for an eyeshadow has a ton
of product so I guess they were just
trying to find an in-between next up
they gave us this beachy salt spray this
cool way beachy salt spray oh this is
awesome so you shake well and then you
apply it to damp or dry hair style with
fingers for a beachy wave look or style
with bowdry diffuser to add texture
that's really nice so I guess this is
just like a salt spray you just spritz
it in your hair and then make it all
bitchy and messy and beautiful love
can't wait to try this out probably
going to try this like tomorrow and
lastly there comes a SPF 30 bear
Republic natural mineral sunscreen okay
it's a tinted I suppose it yep it's oh
wow
so it's tinted for sure so that's nice
it smells like zinc which is just a
childhood memories oh my my it smells
like Emerald Bay that is the best
smelling thing and it's by bear Republic
and I am definitely if I like this going
to put I'm gonna pick up a full-size
because that seems really really amazing
that is it for the what's in my Ipsy
video I hope you guys all enjoyed it as
I was walking downstairs I saw my Ipsy
bag but right next to it I saw a package
from Sephora so I thought I don't even
know I don't remember what i bought from
sephora i'm like trying to think when i
literally don't even remember so I
thought it'd be kind of fun if I just
opened it really quickly in this video
cuz I don't think it Oh muscle got it I
got it in like a weird way but I got it
I bought more of my Too Faced my
favorite Too Faced melted liquid or
liquefied long-wearing lipstick one in
the shade melted fig which is like a
purplish kind of color I don't even know
what I'm going to wear that that's
really nice though I also got the shade
which is like purple um melted villain
interesting
this is villain that purple shade and
this is fig that's so pretty oh my god I
love these I love I love it hi oh yes
finally I picked up a new Kat Von D
tattoo liner in just like the black
color but I really needed a new eyeliner
so thank God it's called trooper this is
like my Holy Grail eyeliner it's just oh
my god they change the packaging that's
really pretty
I picked up three of them picked up
three of the tattoo eyeliners because
they run out fast and I always need them
I think that was probably a waste but
I'm really glad about it so I also
picked up the Too Faced another one of
these in the shade called Chihuahua oh I
almost got this one at the store and I
really liked it I'm so glad this game
I'm so glad I pulled through this okay I
love that it's a good neutral purplish
nude also I picked up this Dior Dior
mascara I really wanted to try it this
uh this might be a little fancy like a
Dior mascara but first that packaging
hello and then open oh oh that's so
thick that wand Wow um one of my friends
like swears by this mascara so I wanted
to try it the stuff I have doesn't mean
you need to go and buy a Dior mascara
and plus the stuff I get I want to like
review and show you guys and really I'm
like the test dummy you can think of me
like that
I got another tattoo eyeliner I got four
no I didn't ha they gave me an extra
tattoo eyeliner I didn't order for I
order three and they gave me another one
