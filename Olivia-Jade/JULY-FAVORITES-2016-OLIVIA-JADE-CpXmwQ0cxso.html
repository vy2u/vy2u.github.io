I am doing my July favorites because I
guess we're kind of entering mid-august
but I do have a couple favorites from
July and you are throwing open and stuff
that I haven't been using or loving for
the month of July or even before that
that I haven't gotten around to putting
in a different favorites video so before
we get into the July favorites it would
make me so happy if you guys aren't
subscribed if you would subscribe if
you're new I'm Olivia I post videos
every Wednesday and Sunday or at least I
try to um and yeah what's basically all
you need to know about me and I post
makeup fashion beauty all the fun stuff
so if you're into that and you're
looking for a new youtuber hi but anyway
that further ado let's get into the
video oh I'm going to start with
something random first and I was just in
Canada if you guys follow me on snapchat
which you should I have been
snapchatting a lot more lately but I was
just in Canada and from Canada to the
place that I was going from the airport
it was a two-hour drive
so this Mophie saved my life first I
think the colors so perfect it's like
this pink gold and it lasts a really
long time to the battery on it super
good the only thing is I have a 6s plus
and then with this case it makes it look
like I carry around an iPad but I'm
obsessed with movies portable chargers
all of that I'm going to keep the theme
going with random favorites before I
jump into my beauty favorites and this
is my favorite planner at the moment my
favorite planner ever it says I am very
busy and it says 2017 at the bottom and
you guys actually helped me pick this
out on Twitter because I posted two
photos of planners and I was like I
don't know which one to get and most of
you guys said that you liked the blue
but it was so close there's like a
different Gold option so I got this off
a website called bando fan dope I don't
know pop that link down below I'll have
all my favorites link down below if I
can find them but I don't know this
planner is amazing it has so much room
to write it has a section for notes and
it goes throughout the whole entire
school year so I've been using this
like plan out my videos and then I will
be using it for my school planner
because my school doesn't give me a
boner I don't know why now I'm going to
move on to skincare and cleaning your
face and all of that
I have skincare routines posted on this
channel I have a bunch of stuff for you
guys already that you guys pretty much
know my skincare routine but I'm all
about finding new products to take off
makeup so number one is this occu soft
lip scrub and it's an eye lift cleanser
for mild moderate conditions it cleans
comforts and refreshes for soothing
relief but this stuff is like a foam and
you just packaging is kind of weird
looking but it works wonders it's a foam
and you rub it on your eyes and it
literally takes off every single ounce
of eye makeup you have on which I love
that is a foam because I really do have
sensitive eyes and I don't like
scrubbing like really really rough on my
eyes it's just it's not good
another thing as you guys can tell I
hate taking off my makeup so anything I
can find that like it's an easy way to
take it off I'm going to share with you
this is the dine your cosmetics I don't
how to say that blue eye makeup remover
it's the two phase formula and it's
oil-free and I just use this on a cotton
pad and just wipe my eyes with this and
it takes off makeup and it's amazing and
it's really gentle on your face and it
is like a liquid but it doesn't feel
oily obviously it's all free but
sometimes when things are oil free it
still feels kind of oily on my skin I
don't know why but this is amazing also
for lip hydration this is something that
I've been obsessed with it's my Smith's
rosebud sole little lip first I just
love the container this I used to have
this when I was little in a little tin
uh sorry
oh my god it's so good my stuff is in a
little tin translator and when I found
this I was so much happier because I
could never get the tin to open um so I
just carry this in my purse and I find
myself grabbing this so much it's such a
lifesaver to just carry around with you
you can get at Sephora or Outfitters
Kitson
okay I think of everything I'm going to
show you today how to all my favorites
in the world this has to be my number
one favorite this is my renewed hope in
a jar micro renewal hydrating mist by
philosophy first the smell I don't even
know how to the rose nor oh so it's like
a flower scented I wish this was a
deodorant because it smells that good so
first the smell is amazing and I just
spray this after I cleanse my skin if
I'm too lazy to moisturize or just I
need a little bit of extra hydration and
this is amazing I used to perform makeup
I used before betting's in the morning
from not wearing makeup I'm shocked that
all of its not gone I usually just
spritz a lot so it's been lasting a long
time but I'm 1020 percent getting this
the second I run out because this is
something like when you run out of it
you don't know what to do with your life
like this is something that is so
crucial in like your skincare routine
now going on to makeup um you guys know
I'm sure put this in a favourites from a
while back but since my channel is drawn
I want to share it with people that are
earlier and this is my brow is from
honest Asya Beverly Hills it has a
little spoolie and then it also has the
pencil I tried the brown definer which
is a little bit different because I was
watching youtubers and some people seem
to love it but I just never it just
didn't work for my skin tone and my brow
like my brow wasn't really holding the
product and this is just a lot easier
for my brows to use um so I'm in the
shade soft brown and that's real I have
to say about that that pencil saves me
so much time in the morning amen
I also forgot to mention for skincare is
the Neutrogena makeup
moving cleansing towelettes there the
night calming ones and these are really
really good they just take off my makeup
really well I don't just depend on these
take my makeup off because it's really
hard to find a wipe that completely
clears your skin and takes every single
ounce of makeup off but this does a
pretty good job it's like comes really
close and sometimes if you know we all
have our lazy nights we're not going to
lie not everybody always has the energy
to I'm really good about watching my
skin I try and do it every single
morning and every single night
but sometimes if I'm out late and I just
come home and I'm really tired and I
don't have to enter you to even wash my
skin at all I'll always leave these by
my bedside just so I feel like I'm not
something with a full face of makeup on
and then I can rinse the rest off in the
morning that's not a good habit to get
into really try and wash your skin a lot
but yeah these are just a lifesaver for
those lazy nights that you're like I
can't this palette is everything this is
the morphe 35o palette and this is
everything as I said it is always sold
out on morphe I believe but hopefully
it's back in stock when I'm posting
because look at the shade that goes from
like the most perfect Browns to like the
perfect oranges to like the perfect
nudes it's literally my obsession I use
this almost every day now and it's just
like if you could have or need any
palette in your life for everyday I
would definitely recommend this one for
makeup this has just been a necessity
for me after I set my makeup because I
do like wearing like full coverage
makeup I do have I think I like to say I
have good skin I don't know I don't
think I have crazy crazy acne or
anything so we don't need full coverage
but when I want to go all out or if it's
an event or a party or premiere setting
your makeup with this automatically just
stuff like that all that excess powder
that's like lying on your skin it just
kind of like presses it into your face
so this just kind of takes away the cake
but it also makes your makeup last all
day um for mascara I actually is go pick
up the full size because I don't know
why I have this little itty bitty but
this is the makeup forever smoky
extravagant mascara and it
kind of is like a tapered wand and it's
literally the best mascara I've ever
used I have it on and I don't have false
lashes on or anything I've had this on
since really early in the morning
because I filmed a tutorial on this one
for you guys so it's coming after all it
I thought it'd be fun to film anyway but
yeah this is the bomb calm this mascara
is everything and it makes your lashes
so long and like so thick and volumize
and you guys have to try it at least a
little baby sample size just to hear me
out so something I've been loving makeup
wise is this tinted moisturizer by Laura
Mercier it's the oil-free one and it is
in the shade bisque I've been loving it
also because it's summertime and I don't
want to put foundation on every day but
when I do want to put makeup on and I
want just something to even out my skin
this is everything I have also been
obsessed with my Make Up For Ever Ultra
HD foundation stick in the shade y20
this matches I've it on my skin right
now and it just gives it's a stick
foundation so it gives such whole
coverage this is the most full coverage
foundation I have ever used in my life I
promise you you will be obsessed if you
have you can make this look super
natural and then you can also make it
look like damn that girl has the most
flawless skin if you are looking for a
new foundation that's not liquid and you
don't have super dry skin and you can
handle a stick foundation I seriously
recommend this and lastly to finish off
my favorites for this month I'm talking
about my favorite product probably in
all of makeup history the Laura Mercier
set the loose setting powder in
translucent so make sure if you guys
pick this up they've a big size I'm a
small size and I almost got confused my
first time it's not the secret eye
brightening powder so don't pick up that
one because you will be confused because
it's not the same and it's kind of in
the same packaging but um so it's in
translucent and it's the best powder I
baked with this a lot and I didn't know
if it was the powder or the baking at
first when I first started using this
but I really figured out that it was the
powder that baking is a huge help
but this powder is litter
the best thing ever you guys all have to
try this out they have a smaller size
it's cheaper so you guys can test it out
but I'm obsessed
so only good things to say about that oh
that's it for my July favorites thank
you so much for watching I love you guys
and if you're not subscribed please
