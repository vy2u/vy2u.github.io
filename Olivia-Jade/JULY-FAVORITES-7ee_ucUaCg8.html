I am filming my July favorites I'm
actually filming this on my mom's
birthday she's no red mark it's mosquito
bite and I just like scratched it funny
story actually I woke up at like 3:00
a.m. just something like buzzing in my
ear like a couple nights ago and then I
saw it the next morning it was a
freaking mosquito like so large and I
felt like I was like half asleep because
it was like 3:00 a.m. and like it woke
me up
and hear this like buzzing in my ear and
it this is so off-topic and so not
interesting I don't know what I'm saying
um anyway yeah then I slept in my
brother's room in this fricking mosquito
I found it the next morning and I let it
outside because it's like on the window
I don't know why I'm still telling you
this today I'm filming my July favorites
so if you guys do want to see them it's
all makeup if you guys you want to see
it what I've been loving not like an
overwhelming amount of products so this
video shouldn't fold my phone sorry this
video shouldn't be like crazy crazy long
so if you guys do want to see then just
keep watching and hope you all enjoy so
first starting out with a palette I have
been loving the Sigma Flair eyeshadow
palette I just obsessed with the colors
I love using mac fix+ spray on these
colors and it just makes them so so
pigmented what I like about them is this
palette is how's it go very nice like
wide range of colors so even like the
Browns right there come out a really
strong purple undertone which i think is
so fun to play around with so I've been
using this a ton up for I was dropped it
would it be the first time um but I've
been using this for the month of July
just playing around with the colors I
think guys would like to see tutorial on
this just let me know by commenting down
below if you're into makeup
then I suggest getting this palette I
wouldn't suggest it for a beginners
palette but I would definitely suggest
it if you're like into makeup and you
want to play around with colors and they
are not like pigmented when you first
put them on your brush which I
personally like for this palette because
that means it's super easy to blend out
and like build up so I
this palette has been great green eyes
this would compliment you so so so
nicely so yeah I'll have a link down
below to Sigma's products by the way so
yeah that's the first love
next is a foundation these are I have
two of them so the first one is the
Maybelline fit me the new one it's the
dewy plus smooth and I have it in the
shade 120 classic ivory I am obsessed
with this foundation it blends out so
nicely first time I tried it I found it
kind of looked patchy but honestly so
wrong you just can't go in with
foundation with just a tunnel and you
have to build up I've learned that with
all foundations so this one is for
normal to dry skin I think I have kind
of like normal to oily in the t-zone dry
skin so I don't know where I fall in the
spectrum of normal to dry but or oily
dry but I do really love this foundation
another foundation I've been loving is
the Maybelline fit me foundation in one
one five this is just the normal one
where this one is the new dewy smooth
one so there's a little bit of a
difference I bought both of these to
match my perfect color but now when I'm
a little fair I use this one and when
I'm a little tan I use this one and I
love them both they both blend out super
super super beautifully I think I love
the dewy smooth one tiny bit more
because it's newer
so obviously the product and the formula
and whatever is put in it is probably
updated a little bit better newer
cleaner fresher but I just like a dewy
look and this one is very easy to make
dewy with like a luminous or like an
illuminator underneath or something but
yeah anyway both of them are amazing and
the color range is just on point so next
two highlighters the first one is my
Becca cosmetics shimmering skin
Perfector pressed powder in the shade
opal I am obsessed with it I have it
my oh um I usually have this on them so
yeah I love this I don't know why I keep
pointing my face I don't have it on
I love yet you are not wearing this
shape but it's pretty and clearly I want
to be wearing it because I for some
reason keep I'll show you the highlight
I'm wearing in this it's a part of my
favorite I just took a chunk out opal my
name is um but yeah it's great
love it Viper Cosmetics gives a
beautiful highlight and it's definitely
different from champagne pop a lot of
people don't notice a huge difference
highlighters everybody's like your face
just look sherry at the end I really
don't see a difference but there is a
difference it's with the colors the
pigmentation and this is pigmented it
kind of has a goldish goldish white
pearly finish so that's that and then
the second pack of cosmetics highlight
is the rose gold this is just has a kind
of bronzy pinky sun glowy kind of
undertone you can see that right there
it kind of looks like opal when you hold
it up like this but when you catch it in
that light boom so nice I also have been
loving for highlight which I have action
on my cheek this time for real it's the
makeup forever Pro sculpting duo
bronzing face contour and highlight and
it's like the little 2o which you've
probably seen if you like watching me
videos um the top is a beautiful
highlight I have on and I also use the
bronzer to warm up my face with on my
forehead around kind of every out kind
of everywhere on my face right now
I am obsessed with this I kind of mix
them together to give myself that glowy
bronzy warm cheek and then I put the
highlight on top of my cheekbones I like
take so much and I like rubbing cuz I
get like super in treatment so I love
that and then the bronzer is beautiful
the bronzer you have to start with a
light hand if you put like a bunch in
and then put it on its gonna be harder
to blend out but kind of goes with any
product but I do love the finish
and the payoff and it doesn't look cakey
or anything it looks so natural and
beautiful I mean obviously like sparkly
cheeks isn't the most natural looking
thing but this product will get it to
you will give you that highlight as
naturalistic it's gonna get so I don't
know if that makes sense but I'm too
lazy to retry to phrase what I said so
we try to phrase rephrase what I've said
I need to move on my head it's hot in
here
like I look a bunch of light shining on
me right now it's not a good combo next
up is my Rimmel natural bronzer
waterproof bronzing powder I love this
because I don't have a waterproof
bronzing powder or lies I do but I
didn't have one for a really long time
and I'm always at the beach or in the
water or something and I wouldn't say
that this is gonna like last through
like the ocean waves in the water and
everything like that like it's still
makeup it's not gonna be like invincible
but the color of it is beautiful it's
like it's a little more orange e Brown
instead of gray Brown so it just gives
your cheeks like the most beautiful tan
and it honestly just looks like this Sun
it was just beating down on you all day
and you've got this like glowy fresh
like amazing face and I am obsessed I
like bringing this like down my neck too
because it's so good it's in the shade
0:22 Sun bronzed so I love that so that
is it for my July favorites as I said it
was quick it was fun it was fab these
have been like my ride-or-die products
for this month so everything will be
linked down below
hot um and yes so love you all see you
guys next time

weird way to end the video but Real Talk
