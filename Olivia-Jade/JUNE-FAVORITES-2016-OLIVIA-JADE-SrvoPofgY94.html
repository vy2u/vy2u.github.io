bring my per minute what about is my gum
hello Ruby
oh my god Brandon gone hi guys welcome
back today I am filming a June favorites
um I know it's not exactly the end of
June yet
but what is it kind of is it's like the
twenty-something so that's good um so I
don't have in like overwhelming amount
of products I'm going to keep this kind
of short there are I can't see English
there aren't a lot of random things I
would say there are more like beauty
products make up all that skincare and
then I have one random thing which I'm
going to start with so if you guys want
to know what I've been loving for this
month then just keep watching first
random favorite is my snowball ice I
think that that's what it's called blue
microphone yeah it looks like this I got
it on Amazon I'll have it linked down
below if you guys are looking for a good
mic and basically what you do is you
just plug into your computer and then it
pops up like when you're recording your
bow suit I can't speak when you're
recording your voice over on Final Cut
that's how I edit my videos and yeah I
just record my voice over and this like
once it's plugged into your computer
automatically like the light shines on
and you know you're recording or that
it's like connected I use this in my
father's day get ready with me video and
I just thought the quality improved so
much from my laughs get ready with me
video which I did like a summer day out
so if you guys compared those um
voiceovers you could probably hear a
difference I used my phone on my summer
day at one and this mic on my father's
day one and it was less of an echo it
was clear so a lot of you guys also said
you thought the quality of the
voice-over was improved so that's my
first favorite and then I just have a
little bag of my favorite beauty
products and I literally have probably
six things in here I like keeping
favorites videos short because I really
want to tell you guys what I actually
been loving so number one starting with
my Kylie lip kit I know this is so
cliche and kind of annoying because it's
super hard to get but this is $29 I
think and I and I would say that's an
expensive price
for a lip product but it does come with
a liner and gloss um which I think it's
good so this isn't shade exposed it's on
my lips right now so you guys can see
what it looks like on it dries matte it
doesn't feel drying and um yeah it's
just a really really nice it's like my
perfect nude and it just goes on super
super smooth I love it that's that you
feel me I feel you thanks mouth next I
have been loving my Too Faced Born This
Way Foundation I'm in the shade nude but
not right now because I'm really tan so
I got a darker shade today for VidCon
but yeah I love this foundation I think
it lasts really long time it applies
really beautifully you look flawless
when you have it on it kind of blurs out
any imperfections and it's also super
buildable you could go for a really
light coverage or you could go for a
full coverage you guys are probably
super sick of me talking about this
because it's basically in every video of
mine but I'm telling you it's like my
all-time favorite and going along with
that now they've come out with their new
range born this way naturally naturally
you can't speak radiant concealer you
guys saw me open this in my p.o box one
because they were actually super kind
they didn't send me this I bought this
but they send me the concealers and I
don't think the concealers are out yet
but they will be out soon I'm hoping so
you guys can get your hands on them
they're just as amazing as the
foundation so oh sorry okay next
for brows I've been loving my Sigma brow
powder in medium that's the shade it's
called medium and it basically comes
with like a double side as you can see
so the darker side is there and then the
lighter side and I usually use my own
astrology a Beverly Hills brow brush
it's like says the number 12 on it I
don't know what that means but it looks
like this and I just kind of take the
lighter side and fill in the brows and
then I take the darker side and get the
tail of the brow I think that way it
just kind of looks like a more natural
kind of hombre brow effect that is it
for makeup and now I have two skin care
products and we're already done this is
going to actually be the world's
shortest video but that's okay so next
up I've been loving my
i Garnier's contractive micellar
cleansing water
um this is my holy grail thing to take
off my makeup I just stick it on a
cotton pad and rub it off my face I had
a comment though when I use this in my
skincare routine and somebody told me
they had carcinogens in it so now I'm a
little nervous
I read all over and it didn't say on it
and basically we don't know what that is
I think somehow carcinogens cause cancer
or they have something to cancer I don't
I don't really know a lot about that so
sorry if I sound dumb I think maybe they
improved it I don't really know
let me know if you guys know the answer
to that but lastly to finish off with
like actual products that I'm folding or
just actually just finish off I have
been loving my renewed hoping ajar
philosophy overnight recharging and
refining moisturizer if your if your
skin ever feels dry or flaky are you
just like need something - like
seriously hydrate your skin as you sleep
I I know
philosophy as a brand can be really
expensive but their stuff is actually
really really amazing especially this
moisturizer um I don't know what I would
do without it especially when my skin
feels super dry and if you got to
anything cheaper and better please
comment it down below because please
help with sister out that is it for my
June favorites I'm sorry for the quick
video but I hope you guys enjoyed what
