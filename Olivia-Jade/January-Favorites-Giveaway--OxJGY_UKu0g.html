haircare and beauty
I'm gonna start with hair um so the
first thing I've been loving is this
L'Oreal professional texture expert
smooth valeurs
smoothing lotion
haier things product um it's really
really good you just use it after the
shower and wet hair and you just kind of
run it through your hair and then when
your hair dries it dries super smooth
and soft and it kind of almost feels
like you thinned it out a little bit
it doesn't look thinned out don't worry
it just like feels a lot better it's way
easier to work with and then this is
amazing if you actually have time after
you wash your hair and you blow-dry it
with this in it it smells so good too
and it just makes your hair so smooth
and soft and like very shiny it looks
like those commercials that you're like
oh my god I wish my hair looked like
that oh it smells so good I'm going to
start with a lotion and it is the EOS
boost love your skin complete care hand
in body lotion 90 percent natural
paraben free it is an amazing body
lotion and hand lotion and it smells
like Coke and I swept myself in the face
almost I don't know why I wouldn't like
that cuz I didn't hit myself in the face
but I thought I was going to so it was
just like reflex I got it in the scent
coconut which smells amazing it smells
so good
wait does it yes it smell so good
doesn't have a name on it but this is
what it looks like um it makes your skin
super smooth I'll have a link down below
if you guys are interested in buying it
next for skincare um I have this little
product the Garnier skin nachos micellar
cleansing water ordered off of Amazon
and I think they don't sell these in
America it is a makeup remover it also
removes dirt and it removes your face
your eyes and your lips it smells
amazing if it gets in you it does not
smell amazing I don't know why I said
that doesn't smell like anything that's
so weird it doesn't smell like a thing I
don't know why he said that kidding oh
oh I got lipstick on it did I smudge my
face hmm
um but yeah yeah I'll have these link
down below on Amazon because they smell
so good
oh my god why do they keep saying they
smell good I mean they work well I don't
even know guys I don't know
next for skincare is two products that
have been just kind of my everyday at
night cleansers these I believe are more
pricey I'm not sure how much they are
but they are very very very very very
very very very very good they oh they
are the Lancer at skincare the polish
and the cleanse the pause I could scrub
and it feels like sand on your face and
then the cleanse is just a smooth facial
cleanser so I use the polish only at
nighttime so I do the polish and then
the cleanse and then in the morning I
just do the cleanse and it's been
keeping my skin solid so far knock on
wood I need to knock on what kidding
seriously I just filled out all my
makeup okay and now for a beauty product
I have a lot of concealers in here that
I realized really them like evens you so
the first concealer that I've been
loving is an old favorite which is the
maybelline instant age rewind which is
just this one it is in the color neutral
eyes you twist this little part here and
then product comes up from obviously
it's a little tube here onto this and
then you just apply it or you can apply
it onto your fingers and then your face
whatever you prefer but I'm not kidding
this is amazing
and it's been an old favorite and it's
continued to be a favorite it's you just
don't get sick of it it's so amazing I
have like three brand new packages that
I haven't opened yet and I still have
like half of that left maybe like a
quarter
so another Maybelline concealer is the
fit me concealer in 20s and I got this
for Christmas and my stocking and I
didn't know what all the hype was about
but I'm not kidding it is amazing even
though the instant age rewind concealer
and the fit me concealer are both by
Maybelline they are very different this
one is kind of a dupe for maybe the NARS
radiant creamy concealer a light
consistency and it blends very easily
this one has a bit more coverage than
this one but this one still gives
amazing amazing amazing cover
and they both range in great different
colors and it ranges from yellow
undertones to pink undertones to all
that jazz so yeah I'm actually obsessed
with both of them and I've used them
both this month like crazy cool next is
my bone concealer from benefit and this
concealer I have a pic jump in literally
how long like eight months and then I
just decided in January to just give it
a go it looks amazing
but if you do have dry under eyes this
is probably not for you one of those
Maybelline ones may be the fit me
concealer would be more your type and it
gives woo it gives good coverage it's a
very light concealer so it gives a nice
highlight and i've just i'm just re and
Garlin over it can you say that about
makeup can you fangirl over makeup so
yeah it's been amazing and it's treated
me very well this month it's good I
should probably stop throwing my
concealers and lastly for concealer is
the Rimmel match perfection concealer
and highlighter this is also one of my
favorite concealers I'm already halfway
done with it it's in this kind of tip so
it goes by pretty quickly I recommend
you guys check that out because in the
u.s. we don't have Rimmel wake me up
concealer and I feel like maybe this is
kind of the same thing the match
perfection I don't know just a thought I
don't know
do we have Rimmel wake me up in America
I don't think we do let me know if we do
because I really want it I really want
to try it I just can't find it anywhere
I said I would stop throwing concealers
so then I dropped it and said go meet
out I'm a mess and then for a highlight
flush blush maybelline master glaze in
the shade
I'd worn nude 40 and it's kind of a
sparkly blush that I applied to my
fingers and then my face or a brush and
then my face I don't really like putting
these types of blushes and highlighters
just straight to my face I don't think
that looks very good but it's personal
preference it looks very very pretty and
in photos it looks like you can see it
in the camera it's a great there I swear
I'm not like being told to advertise
enabling they had just captured my heart
this month next for lip products I have
two and they're a combo and it's the
Bobbi Brown lip color in Rose Barry 26
which is what I'm wearing I can't keep
anything in my hands today it's kind of
a struggle it's a deep red itch color
and then the lip liner from Bobbi Brown
in the crayon contour is in the color
rose and it looks like that they're kind
of a perfect oh my god I can't keep
anything in my hand that's unbelievable
so yeah these two have been like and
they make your lips look kind of bigger
and fuller I don't know why I just kind
of feel that so I thought I would say it
and four eyes um the Physicians Formula
I do stir liquid eye liner in ultra
black hasn't been my BAE oh by just
broken sorry Bella it's yours it's a lot
like the Stila one and the Kat Von D one
that I was using before the line is very
easy to make a wing with and it's dark
and it's a lot cheaper than Cielo and
Kat Von D's so yeah that's why I like it
it's good it's like a very good do with
that eyeliner I don't notice a
difference from Kat Von D - steela
- that one except maybe Kat 1d and Cielo
or like a little bit darker but that
just means you have to apply that one
like twice so it's really not bad the
Maybelline the rocket volume express
mascara and I think this is just in
black yeah
black okay sometimes I kind of clumps
your lashes together so if you like that
look then this is definitely for you but
if you do put this on and then you just
take an eyelash separator or you curl
your lashes before it looks amazing and
they look super full and it's a great
great great drugstore product I think
that's everything so thank you guys all
