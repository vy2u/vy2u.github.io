hope you guys are all doing well today
I'm filming my June favorites this is
all beauty products so I don't have
really anything besides beauty so if you
guys want to watch my favorites my June
favorites if you're curious to see what
my monthly favorites have been then just
keep watching and it really hope you
guys enjoy
first I'm talking about my favorite
highlighter which is my Bobbi Brown
shimmer brick in the color beige this
has been on my channel a couple times
but recently it has just popped back
into my life
and it gives the most beautiful shimmery
highlight I love putting it on the tops
of my cheekbones it makes me look so
glowy and healthy so E I really like it
it's really nice it's really amazing and
it makes your face look so glowy and in
photos you just see that really nice
highlight and yes another highlight I've
been loving is my Mac soft and gentle I
have definitely put this in a favorites
video before but once again it's just
resurfaced I have so much makeup now
like so much that some of these products
kind of get buried away and I don't
really touch them for a little bit so
then when I bring them back out I'm like
oh my so this has been one of those
products it has a more pink undertone
and while this one has a more kind of
white undertone so this looks kind of
like crystal II and this looks kind of
rosy pink
I've gum in my mouth I'm taking that out
sorry and for my third highlight I have
been loving my it cosmetics highlight
innovated technology what is this this
is my hello light illuminating powder I
like putting this on the tops of my
cheekbones and it sends it to not super
super overpowering or too too shimmery I
like putting it down the bridge of my
nose on my forehead sometimes just to
give myself a really glowy you know look
I don't have that's not what I've done
today I have this mixed with the Bobbi
Brown highlight on my cheekbone and I
think it's a beautiful combination but
this alone isn't so overpowering so
that's what I love about it especially
if you're new and you just want a basic
highlighters
that with this it cosmetics one is so
easy to work with and it is so buildable
without looking kind of powdery or cakey
like you have layers and layers of it on
so yeah next is a newer product which is
my Smashbox photo finish primer water if
you like watching a lot of beauty
youtubers you would hear so much rave
about this everybody's obsessed with it
so I picked it up and it works really
well you just need a couple sprays all
over your face and it lets the
foundation settle into your skin
beautifully and it also lets the
foundation last all day I am a big big
fan of it and I love how it's just so
easy to use you can literally just sit
like that any primer on your hand and
rubbing it in it's a very fast and easy
way to prime your face before makeup you
got me another thing that I don't think
I mentioned on my channel before is my
laura mercier secret brightening powder
which is the most amazing under eye
setting powder and it has like little
specks of sparkle or like shimmers in it
but if you use the right brush it kind
of just brushes right off and it looks
totally matte but it just brightens up
your under eyes you're not left with
like shimmers all under your eyes and it
is really really amazing I am yes next
I've been loving my it cosmetics liner
love silk taupe eye liner love I don't
know what this is it's a waterproof
anti-aging cream gel eyeliner and it's
the most amazing color I have ever seen
as you can see it is just so pigmented I
like that word I feel fancy when I use
it literally just one little swirl in
that end this bad boy is just so rich
and dark and creamy like where did you
come from I got way too passionate
talking about this smells like nothing
you were wondering next is a brush which
is my favorite brush ever it is perfect
for foundation for blending out really
anything it is a very dense angled
kabuki brush it is called the 3d HD
kabuki I like that name
it is fancy I love Sigma brushes so much
they're by far my all-time favorite
brushes I've ever used they are pricey
so you know they're good quality but I'm
telling you they are amazing something
that is newer but lipstick is caught in
my mouth our hairs caught my attached to
my lipstick I don't know one thing
something that I have been really into
is cleaning my Beauty Blender because I
noticed that my Beauty Blender was
breaking me out because I never cleaned
it so I picked up the liquid blender
cleanser and some people say it's
unnecessary some people live by it I
live by it my Beauty Blender no longer
breaks me out something I've also been
loving to remove makeup eye makeup I
mean obviously makeup but specifically
eye makeup is the their real remover by
benefit it removes waterproof makeup or
just tattoo makeup or anything like that
it just really really really gets down
and takes it all off I hate waking up
the next morning with black under your
eyes like I would rather just get all of
it off right away so yes a plus next is
my Sigma stand out I stand out peacock
gel liner what is this it's a gel
eyeliner but it is the most beautiful
blue color I have ever seen it looks
like the ocean and like grease or
something so creamy it's very easy to
apply and I love the color it's so fun
and so different I'm definitely going to
be filming a tutorial on this color very
soon I'm just something that I have been
loving is my L'Oreal Paris magic lumi
light infusing a primer so this is a
primer but what I like doing is I like
mixing this in with my foundation as you
can see here it's really glowy I used to
just put this on my face as a primer and
then my foundation on top of it but just
to give myself an ultimate glow and just
my skin looks so
what's the word like bright and it's
just such an amazing illuminator is I
mix this wit OMF up I mix this with my
foundation or BB cream or whatever and
it just brightens up your face and looks
so natural and look so dewy and dang it
has just been solid the next two things
I've been loving are a lipstick or is a
lipstick and is a lip gloss this is my
Laura Mercier gloss and bare baby which
is this the most sparkling beautiful
natural baby pink color love for putting
this on top of a bright color on its own
it's just yes I love it and I've been
loving my Kate Moss Rimmel lipstick in
the shade 104 it is a beautiful dark
pink perfect for the summer winter
spring any season this lipstick is yours
it is amazing and so that is it for my
June favorite beauty products I hope you
