welcome back to my channel if you've
been here before my name is Olivia
LBJ never done my intro like this but
I'm feeling it I'm writing away about
today you guys can tell by the title I
am going to be doing a review and
testing out the new Kim Kardashian west
or k'kaw Beauty collection if you guys
don't know where have you been but they
launched on June 21st at 9 a.m. Pacific
Standard Time so I wanted to get this
video up for you guys to see a review
before spending your money they retail
for $48 it comes with a cream
highlighting stick and a cream contour
stick and the contour stick has two
bronze and shades and the highlighting
stick has two highlighting shades
Asherah highlight and a matte highlight
on the stick so basically each product
if you divide 48 by 4 that comes down to
each stick technically if they were also
individually being around $12
I have them all right here every single
shade I know that are out yet but just
came back from the launch party for
these products and they gifted us the
cream contour in my light sticks so I
thought I would just sit down from a
very honest review at telling you how I
like them personally my opinion does not
mean it's going to go for everyone some
people may hate them if I love them and
if I hate them some people may love them
you know everyone has a different
opinion but I'm going to give you guys
my 100% honest review how what I think
of them and I think it's worth the price
blah-blah-blah-blah so there are four
different shades I'm gonna start from
lightest to darkest the first shade is
in the shade light clever
the next shade is medium then you have
dark and then the darkest is deep dark
so I feel like once I open we're going
to see all the different shades you know
but it does kind of encapsulate a good
amount of skin range and color which is
nice
let's open up light first and see what
this is all about each little path comes
with a cream highlighting stick and a
cream contouring stick and then it also
has an applicator it has a dual sided
sponge and brush one pen is a complete
highlighter and then the other pen is a
complete contour stick the first thing I
want to look at is this contour stick it
has two different bronzing shades and
one side is kind of like a more cool
tone for contouring and then the other
side is more of like a rich warm tone
for like bronzing your skin so these are
the two shades you can clearly see that
this is the more cool tone for
contouring and then this is the more
brandy shade and then for the light side
the highlighting stick has a cream
highlight in a matte highlight at the
first look this cream highlighting style
looks kind of yellow like a yellow
highlight but hopefully it's kind of
like a more white pearl and then the
clean map guide just looks like this
okay I don't know why the middle of my
hand looks orange but I just tried to
wipe it off with makeup and I don't know
what that is you have the shimmer
highlight and obviously the matte
highlight and then you have the warm
Bronte contour and the cool tone contour
and that's in the shade light so now
that we've swatch that I'm going to move
on to the shade medium and give them a
swatch
I'm going to start with the contour and
we have this one side let's give it a
swatch don't know which is the cool time
oh I even notice on the actual packaging
this side says number two and decisive
number one so the number one side must
be the lighter
yeah the leg aside that's right not
really clover Marcus this is what the
bronzer looks like for medium you have
your dark tone and your lighter tone but
they're very similar and then for the
highlighter whoo this shimmer is
gorgeous
I just died and this is the medium side
so this is light and this is medium you
guys can see in comparison to one
another this is the highlight shaker
medium and this is the matte highlight
shinstr medium and then you have your
two contours I would say they're pretty
similar obviously you can see a tiny bit
of difference in just tone of the
mediums obviously a tiny bit darker but
I would say both the match and
highlighting shapes are very pink I'm
going to take both of these off in my
hands and then I'm going to compare dark
to be dark so all the way back my have
dark and then deep okay
okay so obviously you can see a
difference in dark and deep dark big old
super super creamy and I love the
highlights shapes they're super warm and
they're gorgeous they're so so pretty so
now that i've swatched all these i want
to actually try the product i'm so
excited and i'm also going to be trying
out the brush that comes with it of
course so this is what the brush looks
like it has a sponge on one side and
then an actual brush on the other the
girl said to use a sponge to blend out
the highlights by pouncing and then
taking the brush and rubbing it up I
think I'm going to try rubbing up a
contour with this brush and yeah we're
going to just get going for this
I think I'm going to be in the shade
medium I might be light but let's find
out
excuse me really oily skin and also how
I'm barely wearing any foundation you
can look see on my system whatever but I
really want to test these products and
see the coverage of stuff I'm going to
start with the highlight I'm using the
shade medium and I'm going to start by
using the matte side and I'm just going
to create the other two shade I'm
triangle I saw her doing this on her
Instagram Kim doing this on the k'kaw
Instagram page so I'm gonna do it in all
the highlights block high with a
concealer you guys this is super creamy
I'm impressed
I'm impressed okay I'm also going to use
the contour time I'm using the shade one
and I'm just going to put that where I
would normally contour bronze so that I
cut here yeah this is a really good
shade for me all right there
I don't normally contour my nose I don't
really know how but I'll show me to go
I'm gonna start with the blender I set
under a little bit of water but it
doesn't absorb like the Beauty Blender
and so we'll see I'm just going to blend
this concealer out and have it started
trying to blend it with the sponge but I
don't know I feel like it just kind of
took away the product I like it a lot
with my finger it like warms up the
product and it makes it blend really
really flawlessly so I'm going to do is
Evelyn didn't like provide coverage
definitely highlighted what it spokes
like it definitely brought light to my
face and it looks really pretty like I
love how it looks but I felt like my zit
right there I'm going to try taking the
highlighter side again and covering up
my pimples or my zipper numbers right
here to see if it's perhaps coverage
covers it a little Oh actually I
completely take that back it's like kind
of it first of all concealing know that
since I didn't love blending out with
the sponge though that's the one thing I
just think is like average I'm going to
try blending the other side with a
Beauty Blender and see how this works
honestly it like still looks really good
I just think I like using my hands more
like it looks really pretty though but I
almost rather blend it out with my
finger just like super creamy and like
the warmth of my hand really helps melt
the product I'm going to try the brush
and going to attempt to blend in the
contour out oh my god this is so nice
I'm not going to brush honestly with the
contour the actual prop itself I'm like
really impressed with usually I have to
wet my brushes to blend out my cream
like sit contours and this one is just
actually blending wait I'm really
impressed good
I like that brush a lot too to blend it
out we're gonna put my cheeks a little
bit genuinely extremely impressed
especially with the contour stick or the
highlighter I'm going to go ahead and
try the shimmery side obviously you guys
know I love highlighting so let's see
I'm going to just apply it with the
stick so cute okay I'm gonna ply this
side that's a stick and I'm going to
apply the other side mimicking deer to
see which I prefer and the side I pyres
are sick I'm going to use the little
sponge thing for this sponge thing sucks
it's like super average I just think it
was really unnecessary
well like blender I just think alike
makes my face kind of red I just don't
let you the appointment that's the only
thing I'm not really liking but I mean
so love it oh I feel kind of blind side
with my finger I'm so stupid
okay I just love these are such finger
products from you they're so creamy and
the warmth of the hand just really melt
it which I liked it's really subtle if
this is the highlight that's like inner
glow I wouldn't say like well it's
blinding but it's like you're glowing
from within which is my favorite look so
I give it a hundred percent a fuss but
if you like that
streaky like BAM highlight I mean that's
really hard to get with a cream
highlight anyway but I would say that
it's like that glow from within it's
like so natural and gorgeous I'm gonna
keep building it up and seeing if it
gets a little bit more okay so yeah it's
definitely buildable definitely
definitely for sure oh it's so pretty so
the last thing I want to do is finish it
off with setting my face with some
powder just want to see how it sets and
yeah so I'm using a little bit of just
Mac six studio is next to nothing press
powder so let's give this a go
I don't see why it wouldn't like that
yeah that's completely fine so you can
say it
Congrats
yeah so powder products go over it
nicely I think a bronzer would go over
it really nice as well I'm actually
really impressed with this I know a lot
of people they're really controversial
family a lot of people like them they
don't know if they support this whatever
whatever whatever so putting all the
Leafs aside I actually don't mind them
at all I think they're lovely family but
I'm putting all beliefs aside I just
want to say if this was a complete
random brand and I was sent these I
would think these are great they're so
creamy and super super blendable which
is like key for highlighting and
contouring especially in a stick and
yeah just it feels lightweight it
doesn't feel heavy for me this was like
my ideal product because I love light
weight I love cleaning products I love a
good glow and do and this provided all
that for me and I really don't have a
complaint on the skin for the medium
shade the swatches weren't like some
incredible thing but they were really
pretty on the hand I don't really care
how they walked along I think oh nice on
my face I'm really impressed with this
congrats to Kim because this is amazing
and I loved it um thank you guys so much
for watching and I will see you my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
