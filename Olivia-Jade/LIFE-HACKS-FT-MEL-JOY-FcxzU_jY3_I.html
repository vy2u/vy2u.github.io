subscriber right yeah fine these kids my
greatest eat ants I'm just looking at my
grading snail hi guys welcome back to my
channel I am here with Mel joy and um
what I'm doing like hacks we got yes
we're doing at life hacks we're doing
life hacks on both of our channels we'll
do 10 on mine and then 10 AMA and 10 on
hers beauty beauty badges life just
stealing life's like yeah and then her
video will be linked down below and then
at the end you can lick her face I
recently found out how to do that and
now I really thought yeah my cuter work
on the phone though which makes me yeah
is that like your glazes yeah it'll also
be linked if you're not on your computer
number one if you have an eyelash curler
which we did oh okay
so first is if you have eyelash curlers
if you don't know how to put like a
straight line of eyeliner on or you just
have like your hand keep shaking when
you're doing it if you put like eyeliner
on I got you ah you know this part can
you see like you want like the rubber
the rubber part and then and then you
just curl your lashes and you got
perfect fine she said a word so if
Canada we're reliable source
you just got to load it up just line it
up with 100 if you guys have trouble at
getting rid of clothes which I know I do
with my closet is stacked with clothes
but um how to clean out your closet is
you turn all your hangers like backwards
and then when you wear them you put it
back on the hanger like forwards so
they're like facing different ways and
then after a year you go in your closet
and all the hangers facing backwards you
get rid of those clothes you don't wear
them yeah help you purge your clothes so
genius your spray removes stains I'm not
you you should also give yourself
tattoos first feed ah like temporary got
sharp bi you could sharp your I'll and
inspect like spice like some say that
powder bonus like that um anyway if you
have stain and then you just spray
hairspray on it should come out let me
know yeah your hair is ever too greasy
or you have like too much product in it
or you dyed it the wrong color and
you're not happy with the color you just
get dish soap which might sound gross
petition is similar to cancer so it's
all good and you just put in your hair
and wash it out you can even do like in
the sink before school or anything and
it'll get the color out it'll get the
grease out and it'll just strip your
hair down to its natural being I guess
that's a good way
oh this one's so weird but I really like
I think it's useful
we ourselves yeah they're cool um okay
so you know when you have a bug bite and
it's cheap please write when it's like
starting to itch use a glue stick and do
it and then all stop like the itch and
like 15 minutes and it won't come back
you won't want to Jenni all sticky
yeah but I feel like prevents like from
it like it like you don't feel anymore
actually quickly like numbs it or
something yeah like me I don't know we
have a bug bag get some glue stain up
don't do it like don't get Elmer's glue
yeah so know if you guys ever got gum
stuck in your hair - no can be cause of
getting short hair cuts or anything like
that um get an ice cube and just rub the
gum with it and then it'll freeze and
then you can just easily pull it out you
don't have to cut your hair or anything
so yeah card eyeliner that's what I have
written but the probably doesn't make
any I have red powder like a business
card or your license or like a gift card
and you just line it up on your eye then
you take some liquid liner and
I'm angry like the way you want it get
your wig on please on a leap if you guys
have smelly shoes which I know you might
not want to admit but you know we all
have those there you get a you get a--
yeah yeah you take a little bag of like
baking soda and just put it in your
shoes I wouldn't just dump baking soda
in your shoes but like one of the bags
like you know like tea bags or like you
put a little gifts in so it's like you
know the smell can still like absorb
whatever and they just put in your shoes
and then I'll get ready to smell mm-hmm
you don't have to buy those little like
things like this scent little simples
like some shoes I have those for
basketball if you don't know how to I
good that's really good I got you so
many lights on that's really bright so
many I mean - but they're really hot
really I'm sure there's four technically
and my room is closed so yeah and it's a
lack and it's just like it's really a
struggle this is anyway okay if you
don't how to iron your clothing you
don't wanna get out that long table
that's just such that's just such a
hassle like struggle it's not nice real
it's not right and so what you can do is
you can take like a flat iron like a
straightening iron and then plug it in
iron your shirt whatever you need to do
yeah and you're going to you're going to
be using that yeah me too last one
I gotta making it goin out how to
waterproof your shoes is one if you guys
I don't know if it um you guys have rain
where you live all you do is you get
some beeswax which you can buy anywhere
for like a dollar and just rub it on
your shoes it might look weird at first
