explain something because as you can
tell by the title it says luxury what I
got for Christmas all this is it to be
like Oh luxury look at me like click on

more like a warning I guess you don't
want to see that kind of stuff then just
don't watch this video I did say if you
guys are like just stumbling upon this
video you don't know who I am
I'm Livia what's up but if you guys
aren't like subscribers with me you guys
know on snapchat and Twitter and stuff I
was like I really don't know if I want
to do this video I don't want to brag I
don't want to hurt people's feelings I
don't want to make people feel bad and
get something like like I'd rather like

someone will help me with that a little
later so happy I got the iPhone 7 plus

weird

to write and how turns off what I got I
know I got a lot of nice items I'm
really grateful I don't need to like
blow through this and get oh look what I
opened I got like I should have filmed
like me opening the guest that would
have been like pure reaction I don't
want to brag I don't want to show off I
really debated filming this video for a
long time because I just didn't want to
hurt anyone's feelings or anything like
that at all um so I hope you guys
understand that I'm just doing this
because I know it's really popular and a
lot of people want to see it so I'm just
doing what you guys want but again I
didn't have to do this so I'm really
