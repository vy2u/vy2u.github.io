show you guys what I got for Christmas I
want to start with these boots that I've
been really wanting but I haven't really
said anything I didn't put a Christmas
list together this year but my sister
knows everything about me so she bought
me these thanks fella they're the
off-white boots that say for walking
they are just badass like these are the
they're so cool I'm sorry I'm really
excited but she found these on sale when
the portait was doing like their massive
sale and snagged them for me so I'm
obsessive them I think they're so cute
I'm probably gonna wear them to dinner
tonight if I feel better my brother my
sweet sweet brother got me this perfume
it's a Valentino perfume I don't know
it's
in it what scent is it I don't even know
I mean come on that's the cutest thing
ever
Valentino Dona Valentino sweet mix with
floral if you're wondering my uncle and
aunt essence on my mom's side got me
this really nice gift card to Sephora
let's go through some clothing items Oh
first this little top it just ties
around I think it's very cute wrap top
from for lovin lemons and it's just like
this star this cream with like yellow
mustard stars and then it wraps around
and ties this shirt is what is this I
think this is this is lovers and friends
and it's just like a little off the
shoulder top I knew that's colors
amazing so that's very cool Santa got me
this little tank top I think this with
just like some jeans and a nice boot
even those off like boots it's with like
a nice Jean would be so cute
Santa got me this nice little bra top
and it's like a top and I think it could
be worn with like these shorts but I
would be lucky if this fits over one
boob this is the small this is so small
but I really like it I was laughing when
I opened it was like because my sister
picked this out for me and she was like
I thought you would like it I was like I
like it but it's really quite tiny
maybe it'll be stretchy on and then it
comes with like these little drawstring
those are so nice this set is pretty
cute this is I feel like very kind of
old fashioned vibes it's like this
little wild Fox bodysuit and its really
soft but it comes with these awesome
matching shorts so that was pretty cool
also yes I'm in the same outfit as I
wore last year in my Christmas haul
because I'm making it a tradition it's
just really nice Zimmermann dress it is
a little bit expensive but I think it's
just beautiful and with really
high-quality items like this like I will
wear this forever and I love it these
pants I
I also there then I don't know how to
pronounce this brand Nia Nia Oaks
they're like the striped pant with this
chain really heavy chain belt and then
it's just pinstripes really straight leg
this little top it says special lady and
I think it's adorable this with just
some Levi's and sneakers very casual
very cute I think it's from Urban
Outfitters yeah it is it's just this
purple fuzzy cropped sweater it's a
little v-neck
I think this sweater is very different
and very incredible so thanks Santa I
was talking about these jeans are really
long time ago they're by this brand
girlfriend but the ankle is really cool
because it like folds and cuffs but it's
like a different kind of style that I'm
here and then it's just like girlfriend
has the best fitting jeans so I squealed
oh yeah this little top also is adorable
it's just this little black tank top you
might come across some Easy's this
Christmas this was pretty crazy I
remember I told my sister a while ago I
was like I'm gonna wake up at 6:00 a.m.
for the easy drop and get Yeezys I
didn't realize how hard that was because
that never works for anyone well I guess
does for a lot of people that's how
people get Easy's but I for some reason
couldn't do that these are like I think
100 or $200 purse and then they like go
up after they're all sold out for like
thousands and thousands of dollars so
bail upon these she found these off a
Fight Club and got them for a better
deal cuz Fight Club the thing with that
is their prices go up and down with
theses all the time so she caught them
when it was a good time and I got my
first pair of Yeezys that's cool right
but this is like the most me set ever
it's this little top that looks like
this and then it has this matching
wraparound skirt the brand is oh it's
Free People
these are Levi's I have these in a light
wash and I really like the fit but you
guys are really hit or miss for me these
ones feel like a little hard but I don't
have a dark wash pair so that was cool
they
and there the wedgie fit I would make
this a try on haul but I'm honestly
feeling really under the weather and I
just don't have the energy I'm so sorry
and then also these genes from
Reformation apparently Reformation has
the best fitting jeans some very accepts
to give these a go in my stocking I got
a bunch of bones not gonna show that is
that weird oh these pants these pants
are from Reformation as well I think
these are so fun and crazy they have
like different animals on them so like
cheetahs and zebras and lions and
they're just red and fun and flared and
high-waisted and silky and just a really
good like beach pant alright today this
dress is beautiful it's from Reformation
I think it's so cute it has these nice
little roses or these are not roses
there's just red flowers these nice
little flowers all over it and it's a
little bit of a high-neck and it's just
a really beautiful dress alright so next
I got these shoes I also believe these
were bought on sale I love them they're
just a really classy white sneaker but
since I'm a little bit tiny and has a
nice platform which is amazing I also
got these sunglasses but it does look
like that what's up I also got this
little top from are you am I or you
might has some really good nice basics
love it I got a bunch of bathing suits
so first this bathing suit here it's
Lisa Marie Fernandez and it has like
this nice little blue color it's super
high waisted and then the top looks like
this and this one is from ELF space it's
another high-waisted bikini so these are
what the bottoms look like and then the
top is more of like a straight
neckline whatever you want this light
pink one is from vitamin A it's cool
just color it's a bottom and this is the
top is this a frumpy outfit whatever
stripe bikini top with these bottoms I
got this nice bikini top and it has like
this cute little giraffe and this is out
space as well with the bottoms I got the
new phone iPhone X I'm hiding it under
here I'm really excited I think just the
photos and stuff especially for what I
do with like social media and like
putting stuff on Instagram
hopefully I hate when people say this
with a better content for you guys
that's like the dumbest line when people
say that but I am very excited about it
I really my phone I feel like what Apple
does is they release a new phone and
then they make every other phone stop
working so my phone kept glitching and
freezing and it was a mess
so I'm very happy I have a new phone yay
so you guys that is it for my what I got
for Christmas video thank you so much
for watching I hope you guys enjoyed it
I hope that nobody took this to a fence
it's a light-hearted video this wasn't
meant to make anyone feel like oh look

that but I feel like I self to say
