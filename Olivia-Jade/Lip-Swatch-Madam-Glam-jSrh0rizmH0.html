so unenthusiastic I can't right now
hi everybody welcome back to my channel
today I'm doing a lip swatch video for
the matte lipstick collection of madam
glam in it total there are 10 lipsticks
and I will talk about packaging this is
my first impression as well I've never
watched these or tried these I just kind
of opened up when I got them and looked
up the colors so I'm really excited this
is the whole matte lipstick collection
so I'm here to put it on my lips and
show you the outcome I'll talk about the
packaging how it goes on kind of
everything like that everything you need
to know about this lipstick I will for
sure that was so annoying I will be sure
to let you guys know that so if you guys
want to see the review I will be sure to
eyes I will be sure to go bye I can't
I'm just gonna forget that sentence also
there will be a discount code for these
this whole website in general down below
so I will just list that down below
because I want to help you guys out
let's get started into this video and I
really hope you guys all enjoy they came
in this little package here which i
think is so cute alright so I'm gonna
start with this color called fruit punch
which is wow I'm not I'm definitely not
going to start with the brightest color
it's ready with the color embrace in the
classic matte collection and I'm just
gonna put this all over my lips and then
show you guys the outcome it's a nude
pink with a small small hint of a brown
undertone not too overpowering or too
much I really really like how it looks
on final outcome I actually really
really liked I definitely see myself
wearing this color a lot I really really
like it and it feels like it's going to
last me a really long time because it's
so matte and it doesn't really feel like
it's gonna smudge off so next I'm taking
this color called koi and it's just a
really really bright neon pink
which I really like so that's what the
neon pink looks like on it looks
actually like amazing and I am so in
love with this color this next color is
called nutmeg which is just a brownish
nudish red so I'm obsessed with this
color it's a really nice reddish brown
nude it's not fully throwing yourself
out there with a really strong red but
it's like beautiful brown nude color on
the actual color payoff and then how it
looks afterwards is totally up my alley
I really like it
the next color I'm trying out it's
called amber I like it and I would wear
it on some sort of occasion or something
where I kind of wanted this specific
look but I wouldn't just throw this on
going out I'm not that in love with the
exact color but if you are then don't
let me stop you it's just something that
I'm not like obsessed with because I'm
not really into oranges and this is a
really strong orange undertone so
there's that my lips are getting 4x
color is this one it's called pink a
doodle and it is a pink very pink
lipstick with a heavy purple undertones
oh yeah this one's so creamy that is
this color on this is about one coat one
and a half if you want to apply a little
bit more the color is definitely going
to become more opaque I love this color
I love it it's so fun and like so disco
in my opinion so I really really like it
next I'm trying out seniorita
which is a vampy purplish Brown I've had
this color right now goes super well
with like my whole little run you get up
but um I love this so much as you guys
know I'm kind of into those purpley dark
golf ish colors as some might say so I
am totally obsessed with this that's
perfect with my choker right now I'm
really feeling kind of grunge so I
really like this look um definitely a
big yes for this this is in coca-cola
but spelled with Ches it's a very dark
brown
brownish-red and that's coca-cola
it's a reddish brownish small small
tinge of orange to it but again all of
these I really like the end results have
their Matt they're very opaque next one
is in this color called super rich red I
have red batteries so I'm just like
trying to go quickly I am obsessed with
this color and amazing colors this one
is called Hawaiian fire which is a neon
orange red and I'm so excited it is a
beautiful neon orange red which I know
I'm not the biggest fan of oranges and I
kind of said that before but this one
totally has me like hooked around its
little lipstick oh my gosh I was gonna
cook durand its finger but didn't really
work so the last color I'm finishing off
with is a fruit punch and it's this
really vibrant pink I kind of crushed
the top a little bit but I'm so excited
to try this one on because it is so neon
I don't know if you can see it but it's
beautiful
this color is out of this world amazing
so that's what it looks like on that's
the whole matte lipstick collection
swatched on my lips and now I'll just
talk about the packaging and what it's
not kind of overall and that will be the
end of the video so the packaging is
adorable it's it's just a matte black
packaging and on it it says madam glam
and then it says the colors and what
collection the product is from I think
it's really clean and sleek and it is
just plastic it doesn't feel cheap and
I'm not quite sure the exact price of
these lipsticks but I will have a link
to them down below and I'll also have a
discount code for you guys and I think
it's 30% off of the discount code I'll
have to do cup I'll have the discount
code right here and in the description
so that's it for this video thank you
guys all so much for watching and I
really hope you guys enjoyed it and I
also see your hands in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
