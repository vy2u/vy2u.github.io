Olivia Jade welcome back to another
YouTube video we are doing another
clothing haul oh my god Olivia do you
need more clothes you do so many
clothing cause isn't your clothes
exploding by now yes it is exploding but
the great thing is I'm doing a big
closet clean out and it's all being
donated to charity so it makes them for
new clothing right this video is
sponsored by Lulu's you guys already
know I work with lose a ton I wanted to
do with this little transitioning and to
fall a lot of the pieces I picked out
are very fall appropriate and you can
find everything at Lulu's calm I'm gonna
have all the links to the pieces down
below and yeah I love them so I hope you
guys enjoyed this video don't forget to
subscribe and give it a thumbs up and
let's get started
okay so the first piece I want to start
with is actually what I'm wearing it's
this really nice big like sweater top
and it's actually not too thick like
it's kind of lightweight it is the
softest thing I literally ever put on my
body it is so comfortable I would sleep
in this I would walk around in this I
would I'd you would do everything in
this and I was so excited because little
youtube secret all youtubers if they're
filming waist up chances are they're in
like comfortable pants or something like
I'm in like little comfortable shorts
right now so when I saw this and like
put this on I was like I need to wear
this in my video it's cute but it's also
so comfortable if I can be like really
content while I'm filming okay I want to
talk about this little sweater I think
it is very cute um it's just like this
little moth purplish color with a nice
detail with a high neck and then the
sleeves flare out the smallest bit and
it's not cropped at all it's just like a
nice normal Ankara sweater so I think
this would look really cute tucked into
something cuz the length is it's kind of
like perfect for talking image of jeans
or a skirt or shorts I think this would
look really cute tucked into like some
Levi's jeans and then just like a nice
sneaker for the like fall winter time
another sweater I'm gonna get all the
sweaters out of the way with I also have
this really
comfortable black long sleeve just
sweater top it's a thicker material and
it flares at the sleeve right there and
it just kind of goes a little bit high
up and it's just like this amazing
amazing soft comfortable feel to it and
it's going to be really warm because of
the thickness so if you live in a cold
place where the climate is a little bit
chillier this would be great I also have
this really nice gray knit sweater
there's not really much to it I like the
little design on the front if you want
this to where is my voice hi I'm good if
you want us to be oversized I would just
get it in the size up I got mine in this
small cuz I want it to just be like kind
of cozy and fit but sometimes I really
like sizing up my sweaters and I think
that would be a great one to size up on
if you want it like baggy err I guess
I'll move on to this top because it's
kind of perfect for an LA and I like
fall but this would look really cute
under a jacket the reason I love this
top is because it is so flattering
I think corset tops that are like this
are super flattering on the body and I
think this one's amazing I think this
would look so great with jeans or shorts
or wherever makes sense for you and
where you live and I don't know it just
fits so well you'll see in the Tryon but
I think it's really really really
gorgeous on and I think it would look
good on all shapes which I love okay so
this top is pretty amazing when it's on
the website I was like when I wear this
like I don't know if it would look cute
on me um and then I got it and I tried
it on and it is so awesome it just looks
like this it has this really nice deep
v-neck and then the sleeves have this
amazing pattern kind of mesh see-through
going on with the end detail and I think
it's just gorgeous and it looks so
flattering on so I was like really
stoked about this again it would fit all
shapes and sizes and looks beautiful on
okay I'm gonna talk about this dress
because I think the colors are very in
theme for fall it's a tank dress and it
kind of has a high neck to it and then
it just flows down and it's super flowy
and gorgeous and just elegant and this
is great
for the fall or for the winter or for
the summer because obviously it's a
dress so it could be a really cute
summer dress but also you could throw it
on with like a jacket and make it very
far okra it I need to show you guys this
amazing dress so always when I see like
button hats and stuff I'm like am I
gonna look like a teacher or like some
weird old person that just doesn't get
this style oh I saw this dress on their
website and it's like this very flowy
loose pinstripe gray and white button-up
dress with a little tie that kind of
cinches your waist little you'll see in
the Tryon but what I love about this is
it gives me the most beachy vibes even
though we're like getting away from
beach weather and all that stuff I also
got this skirt in a size small it's a
little bit fake on me when I tried it on
so I would recommend sizing down so if
you're usually a medium maybe go for the
small I'm gonna have this taken in
because I just love the color
it's perfect for fall like this color is
everything I want to talk about this
jacket because it's a cropped denim
black jacket like denim on denim blacken
on black and I'm gonna take a white crop
top would look so cool this jacket I
think looks super high-end like it looks
like real leather but it's not and it's
also a great color how many times am I
gonna say oh my god this perfect fall
color but it really is just looks like
burgundy maroonish red and I think it's
gonna look amazing for the phone time I
think this would look so great with like
a really good pair of jeans and sneakers
and just like a white loose shirt tucked
in a little bit but like coming out a
little bit if you guys want to see in
outfits video for fall like how I would
style these pieces or how about style
other pieces in my closet for fall let
me know and give this video a thumbs up
and if it gets over 15,000 thumbs up I
will do that I don't know how many
thumbs up my average videos that could
be really easy 15,000 whatever I'm
probably gonna film it anyway okay so
that's everything for clothing now I
have a few beanies that I'm gonna show
you just two and they're both cream and
amazing so let's start with this one
this one says obey
on it and it just looks really cute on I
think beanies are a little hard to pull
off sometimes because I don't ever know
if I like look good in them and my mom
can pull off a beanie like you've never
seen a woman pull off me like she looks
so freaking good when she wears hats
that makes me like mmm can I live up to
how cute she looks so I'm always
hesitant to wear beanies and then I also
got another cream one with a little
pom-pom at the top this one kind of
slouches back a little bit and it's just
awesome and it's soft and it's
comfortable so I wasn't not I'm gonna
try out the beanie trend who knows what
will happen okay I want to talk about
this purse because I think this is
amazing this is like one of my favorite
purses and it comes with the strap
obviously so you can wear it as a
crossbody or you can wear it as just a
little handle this is the cutest little
bag and we're like if you're just
looking for a fall staple bag that looks
high-end but super chic this could
almost be like designer I also don't
mean to talk about in this bag because
you can carry like this it also has a
strap inside to make it crossbody I just
thought this was so fun and different
it's like this fur it's like almost like
a bucket bag but it's completely for
obviously fake fur and it's so so soft
and I love gray obviously it's a great
color it matches with everything I want
to talk about some shoes first of all
these mules are awesome they're just
black mules and then they have like um
oh does anyone know what these are like
what are these little circles they're
not studs I don't know I just thought
they were fun they're super comfortable
I'm a size 7 in my shoes and all of them
fit perfectly so the shoe size is on
point
I mean aren't these awesome they're just
these awesome red I don't know they're
just cool they are really comfortable
also and these ones are a little big on
me I got them in a 7 so maybe you could
size down like a half-size if they have
them cuz just the end is like a tiny bit
big but I absolutely love these and
they're comfortable and they're
different and they're super cool these
shoes on my tie on I believe came out a
little bit blurry so I wanted to show
you the detail up close right now
these are awesome they are so so similar
to a Valentino shoe they're almost like
dead perfect I don't even realize
when I place the order and then they
came in honestly these look a lot like a
pair of Valentino shoes that I've seen
so yeah
they're just really dope and I like them
a lot and they are very comfortable I
love how this heel isn't too big but
it's also thicker so it's not like your
foot is that a huge arch it's just
really comfortable so these boots I
think are so fun and very comfortable as
well I love how they're just on a plain
black boot I really like this pattern
and it reminds me a lot of what like
Dolce and Gabbana's doing right now and
you're so I think it's just very in and
very cute so I wanted to get these I
think this would look awesome with a
pair of jeans and lastly these shoes are
awesome so I love the color of these at
this color I don't know I'm really into
the color brown right now especially for
the Fall and this one was just like
everything I could have jumped up and
more so I love it so guys that's it for
