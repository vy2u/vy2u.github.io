today's video I am doing a loose
clothing haul this video is in
collaboration with Lulu's I feel like
lately a lot of people think I'm doing
like crazy Mouse's like partnerships but
I just wanted to know I feel like a half
disclaim this that I would never ever
ever put something on my channel that I
don't genuinely love to genuinely wear
don't genuinely use dojin's in the shop
at there like a lot of people know that
but just for people maybe that are newer
to my channel I don't want you to think
like I would ever put out something but
I don't really use or love you guys draw
no losses it's a really cute like online
store and they have a bunch of summer
dresses right now and they just like pop
in with their summer clothes right now
so I have bought some really cute summer
pieces this is a try on haul if you guys
kind of or to see what the pieces look
like on um yeah that's basically on
today so let's get started so the first
thing we'll start out with is this
layered necklace not this one
but these three it's actually one
necklace and it's from Lulu it's so cute
I wear it every day I'm obsessed with it
I just have this for movies since a
while ago
but I thought I was thrown in since
everyone always asks and it's like the
best piece ever created there's not a
thing is what I'm wearing right now it's
just this really cute beach cover-up I'm
actually about to go to Malibu with a
bunch of my friends right now so I'm
like filming a little bit before but I'm
going to ruin this beach cover-up
because it's for the cute and it lets
really get all on this the length to fit
to cut everything I'm obsessed with it
love it the next thing I want to show
you guys is a really cute summer top so
I feel like as I thank you like in all
my holes I always say I can never thank
you summer shirts and I feel like this
look so cute it just looks like this and
then the back looks like this you'll see
a little bit more clearly what it looks
like when it's on but it's so flattering
and even though it's kind of like loose
fitted it doesn't look like like you're
bulging out it's really really pretty I
guess I'll show you this bathing suit
neck I am NOT going to try on bathing
suits just because I feel like I'm on
the younger side 17 and also I just
there's creepy people on the internet
know I just like know oh but this is the
most gorgeous baby suit ever
it's from Planet flu I think yes blue
life is clinically thing but they carry
it on Lulu and I love the details how it
just has like all these really pretty
crisscross is down the side it's a team
act if you I feel like this in life and
you would look a little bit better if
you had maybe a flatter chap because I
do have a little bit of a bigger chest I
said that last time and then everyone
went crazy but like fire you blinding
him the chasis deal with it but this is
like it's just a lot of cleavage but
it's so really cute and I love the
quality and the design and everything so
this dress I've been looking for for
like ever I just wanted a plain like
black short mini dress that's like kind
of a straight line across that fits
really well is really comfortable and I
kind of got one off of Lulu still
haven't we down below but it's really
just a simple black dress I just thought
it'd be keep strong with like sneakers
and a bomber jacket so I'm happy about
that
although some shorts so I got three
pairs of shorts these first one they're
a little bit like a boyfriend style but
I kind of vibe with it and they're just
like this light wash denim and they look
like visions I think they're really cute
so even though they're kind of baggy and
then this next pair of shorts looks like
this they're a little bit ripped in
distress and then they're kind of like a
medium wash I think they're really cute
though
this third pair is probably like I would
probably wear this other two before this
just could have no a dark wash girl but
if you like dark wash denim I think this
is like really cute still just like not
really my style but it's still cute
shorts okay so everyone just needs a big
basic t-shirt for the summertime
especially one with some color in it
this one that says Sandy Cheeks on it
and I just think it's like the cutest
thing it's just like the big baggy
yellow shirt I think it's perfect for
the summer the little caption at Sandy
Cheeks
doesn't get much cuter than that if you
ask me I also have this body suit which
i think is kind of cool and it kind of
reminds me of the bathing suit a little
bit but not really it's just this black
little v-neck bodysuit and then all
throughout the sides it has
kind of crisscross tide pattern I think
it's really pretty I think it feels
great in the summertime or like a night
out you're like you could really make
this kind of a dressy outfit so I love
it again another bathing suit which I'm
not going to try on but it's just this
little white triangle top I think it's
so cute and then the little matching
bottom I think the bottoms look like
they could probably fit a two-year-old
though like those look really tiny so I
might have to size up I got it a size
extra small I think I might be a small
and then the top I got medium because
even though people to blini I'm going to
do your business oh uh thank you
this dress is absolutely gorgeous like I
am so obsessed with this dress for the
summertime I mean first of all it's off
the shoulders but senses like in this
type where you put your like that you
know put your finger on but you put your
arm through this it doesn't fly up which
is like my least favorite thing about
off-the-shoulder tall and then it's just
like this really stretchy beautiful
material and then it goes just dance
like this little high-low dress it's
absolutely adorable you guys I just
don't have anything bad say about I
think it's like the cutest thing in the
world another dress because blue dresses
are on point for summer and I'm getting
is this little cream-colored dress and
they just show cute just as like a pair
of sneakers you could throw this on over
a bathing suit you literally could wear
this of anything you don't even really
need a brawl 6 it's not let see-through
um I like soap doesn't like girly summer
dresses if you can't tell it's just my
god ok I also have this amazing dress
it's like this really pretty maxi I
think this is going to look so gorgeous
in the summertime to like a nice dinner
or feel like on a little boat ride
somewhere I don't really know but I
think it's just like the cutest thing in
the world
it just highs up across your neck and
then the back has like another knot so
you can like cinch the waist a little
bit and then it's not the dress and I
love the print you guys know I'm not a
huge print girl so that's huge for me
too like fun color and print
and then actually get it like who are
you Olivia who are you becoming I also
have this adorable body suit against us
of it um it looks like this if I can do
it it looks like this and then the back
is all criss cross perspective crop
you'll see in the trial the back is like
equal as part of this bodysuit
the only thing is again I feel like it
looks a little weird since I boobs but
you guys can let me know down in the
chil and if you feel it's good we should
kind of make time to tell you guys suits
in this video I also have this really
adorable that's like my favorite thing
ever
I'm really into these types of shirts
they're like little beach cover-up it's
just like this white linen button-up
shirt and it's long swim and I just
think it's like so perfect for the
summertime I got it in a size small
I honestly might have gone medium just
because I love like the oversized look
but it's just so pretty and I think it's
gold great over a little bathing suit
with some denim shorts cute sneakers
don't button it up all the way kind of
tie the end a little if you want to make
you look super casual and beachy and
lastly for clothing I got this really
cute auntie sue I just don't know can
someone let me know like for the Tryon I
just put like bathing suit pads in it so
you couldn't see through it don't know
what you're actually supposed to wear
under this so if someone could let me
know that would be great
I'm not I'm like not comfortable with
the whole like fashion nips out of your
body suit also I think my mom would like
slit my wrists so uh please let me know
she wouldn't ask you somewhere it's not
even up to people like we're Lachlan
flip the daughter good haha she
acknowledged me um she doesn't let me
like walk out of my house my nipples out
so if some almost let me know like what
your closest owner this that'd be great
because so heute so that was it for
closing I have a couple pairs of shoes
that I'm going to show you guys right
now okay so for the first pair of shoes
there's some Lula's and they're just
like these really pretty tan lace up so
they laced all the way up your ankle and
I think they're just a really pretty
summer shoe especially because of the
color it's gorgeous these next ones are
from Steve Madden but they're carried on
and it might be my favorite show of all
time it's just like it's a perfect brown
color and then it has like this adorable
little PI little details on the end
right there are adorable
everything is perfect I'm so fed
awareness I think that's a looks really
cool women Smith in life I think they
look really cute with like ripped
boyfriend jeans rolled up this and then
like a cute little blouse a nice little
purse and good jewelry I've had a bit it
feels like really high fall too so
that's great and then these are so
interesting to me that I had to get them
they're like these denim print shoes
that look like this I just think they're
so different and so cool
I don't know how its styled these yet so
please let me know how you guys would
style them they have like this big
buckle on the side right there that
looks amazing they fit they're super
comfortable I usually get a size 7 in
all my shoes but if they don't have a 7
I usually go to the some in the house
maybe in these I would have a size down
with it other side and I know but we
love them so if that is it for this
video thank you guys so much for
watching this clothing haul I hope
you've loved it I love you guys so much
and I'll see you next time
