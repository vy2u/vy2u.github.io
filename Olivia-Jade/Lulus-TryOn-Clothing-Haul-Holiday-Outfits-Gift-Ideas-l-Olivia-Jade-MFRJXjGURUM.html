back to my youtube channel in today's
video I am doing a very exciting video
because it is all about the holiday
season and you guys I don't know if you
know this but I am obsessed with
Christmas I mean I feel like everyone
says that but I love love love love the
holiday season I think it told us so
much joy and happiness and I'm gonna be
doing a clothing haul and like a gift
guide kind of thing today I picked it
all out from Lulu's calm you guys know I
work with Lulu's all the time and of
course this videos in Colaba
loose so thank you guys so much but I'm
so excited to show you guys what I
picked out so let's get started some
great holiday outfit pieces some good
gift ideas all under the holiday section
on Lulu's so I will have links below
I'll see you guys I want to let you know
I am now doing a posting schedule I am
posting two times a week crazy I think I
think you bought with it cross my
fingers I am posting Tuesdays and
Fridays so make sure to look out for
videos then and yeah I'm very excited I
know today is Monday so it's gonna start
Friday in the next video you're not
going to give any hope tomorrow to cuz
that's just like too much if you guys
are new here don't forget to subscribe
and give it a thumbs up you know what
all the cool kids are doing I was such a
mom okay for real we're starting out the
first thing I need to start with are
these amazing boots
hold on throw on the floor it takes it
to care myself they are the greatest
things I think this I mean obviously red
is such a festive holiday color but this
can be worn all year round and also you
compare this with I know black and red
I've done this before already with an
all-black outfit in a red shoe but I
mean kind of the same vibe can go with
this I love this this business I said
this like 1,400 times I think they're so
great and you can dress them up dress
them down whatever you want to do
perfect for the holiday time so next is
this cute little bag it's a little more
wool clutch I honestly have never seen
anything like this and I thought it was
very different I think you could I don't
know how I'd wear this yet
I'm gonna figure it out I'm gonna let
you guys know but I just think it's
different and fun and everyone could
always use a little clutch bag also it
has a nice little strap for crossbody if
you don't like holding it okay you guys
I have been obsessed with the color pink
lately I don't know what it is this top
is one of the softest highest quality
tops I've ever felt in my life it's just
a nice little turtleneck
I think this with some vintage Levi's
tucked in and then just a cool white
sneaker is such a look and it's really
soft
I'm telling you I wish you could I wish
technology was at a point where you
could literally feel this for the screen
I mean that's impossible but you go on
to say next
this jacket is absolutely wild it's just
this big fur fake fur coat I was so
excited to wear this I don't even know I
think an all pink outfit with this coat
is such a look you guys are gonna see
make sure to follow my Instagram
I'll have it right here if you guys want
to see how I style all these pieces
amazing love it next a wrap top I love
rap top so what's different about this
it's kind of like a velvety material so
you just tie it around makes your boobs
look super nice and pushed off and then
it's just yeah it's just a basic wrap
top I'm obsessed with my wrap top I have
from the loose I have an army green one
and a black one I've worn them millions
and millions of times I swear so I'm so
excited this is just like a little twist
on it because it's velvet shoes it has
like a nice little tassel on the back
you could honestly cut the tassel off
though if you don't like it if you're
not a tassel girl but it's just this
cute little black boot
I actually really strange enough don't
own like a normal-sized heel just plain
black boots so I mean this isn't
essential at all times but especially
for the holidays you want to give
yourself a little bit of height you want
to dress up your outfit for the parties
and I think this is perfect okay next up
is another little turtleneck top this
one's just kind of like this grayish but
almost sounds like a hint of like purple
and it's super silky and soft its ribbed
I think again just tucked in with jeans
looks great I honestly just need basic
tops I say this all the time in my hauls
and you think like
so many talks and then you're like okay
don't you have enough basic tops but for
some reason they go missing someone's
stealing my shirts and also I hate how
they always look on me I don't know why
like after a certain time I'm reveling
this isn't important at all but does
anyone ever feel like this who just like
buy something and you're like oh it's so
cute then you go home and you're like
weird and you're like do I look
disgusting in this that's how I feel
with my whole life you guys these pants
might arguably be the best thing ever
they are high-waisted like this purple
maroon velvet and just like this flared
out it has slits just like the craziest
most fun pant I've literally ever seen
in my life and it is so perfect for the
holidays of course it's in the holiday
section but seriously like come on come
on are you excited are you so excited
I'm so excited about these okay this
body suit I haven't tried it on yet so I
don't know if it's gonna fit me but I
just think the concept is really cute it
has a little high kind of neck right
here a little turtleneck action but then
it cuts into a V and then it has like a
nice little deep V it's sleeveless and
in the body so I think these types of
shirts or body suits or whatever are so
flattering on so I'm really excited to
see if this fits besides um just having
clothing on their website which also has
in their holiday section like really
cute gift ideas like a gift guide
basically so I picked out two things
that I thought would be great number one
this ago of the water bottle they have
it so many styles of these swell bottles
but I think this is a really cute gift
you could just wrap it up put it in
someone's stalking whatever you want to
do everyone needs to drink water it's so
good for your body and yeah I thought
this was a really nice gift I wanted to
put it in there I think I'm gonna give
it to my mom for Christmas I hope my mom
doesn't watch this video love you mom
okay and lastly I think this is such a
great gift idea it's a rose gold
tweezerman set it has a little cute
toiletry bag and then it has an eyelash
curler and tweezers and it's not that
expensive I don't think obviously I'm
gonna have everything like down below
for you guys but I think this is such a
good gift idea like if you want to help
a guy or girl out if they like wearing
makeup or if they like doing their
eyebrows er
just need like a cute little toiletry
this is the perfect thing so yes so guys
that's it for this video thank you so
