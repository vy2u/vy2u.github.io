this huge makeup haul I have a bunch of
stuff from Sephora and Mac this was not
all bought at once but I've been saving
these products so I could film a video
with them and I've been like trying not
to use them because I wanted to show you
everything I've got like all at ones all
packaged brand new all that good stuff
so if you guys want to see the video
then just keep watching and I hope you
enjoy it and think my hair is ugly so
I'm probably I have to refill this part
okay so we are just going to jump right
into the video I'm praying that this is
in focus starting with good old Sephora
if I bought some that you're curious
about just let me know I'll review it
and I will mention it quickly in a new
video or I can do a whole review just so
you're not spending your money on like
bad stuff I'm like your tests on me I'm
happy to be your tests on me first thing
first thing is this Laura Mercier
foundation primer in hydrating I've
wanted to try this primer for quite some
time
it is the hydrating one I think I
believe my mom used to have this but it
just comes in like a neutral container
and then apparently it just really
really hydrates your skin and it's a
primer so if you don't know what that is
it just makes your foundation last
longer you put it on before you apply
foundation and my mom had this she loved
it so I got it as well what else was
going to say about this I can't remember
town also got this foundation it's the
Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer so it's
in the shade Tony I'm hoping this is my
shade it's ordered this online so
hopefully this work I will let you guys
know how it is but a lot of people love
this so I'm pretty excited what is this
Amazonian clay full coverage airbrush
foundation I am so excited to try this
out um I totally guessed I got the color
light/medium neutral I still don't know
if this is my color I have it open this
since I got it because I'm going to
wanted to do a video oh I'm so excited
to try this this is
clinique beyond perfecting foundation
plus concealer I only use this for
foundation I got it in the lightest
shade which is I forget I'm like so fair
right now it's called breeze that's the
lightest lightest shade it's like a big
lip applicator for I'm not a subscribe
back forget what that's called but like
a spongy applicator for your face you
just kind of paint it on there and then
beauty blender or kabuki brush or
whatever you prefer to use next I got an
eyebrow pencil this is the on estancia
Beverly Hills brow with skinny brow
pencil I've had this a couple times
before I love it if you're looking for
an easy brow product I have thick brows
as you can see so I don't really need
like gels or anything I sometimes use a
powder and I have a really really good
either a trick that I'm going to show
you in my next tutorial um but this just
has a spoolie and then it has the pencil
that winds up and lines down and I love
it and mine is in the shade medium brown
so next I have the tarte
high-performance what is this
chiseling charmers deluxe contour set
this has a little brush of action not
sure an office oh yeah stop it stop it
oh my god that's the tiniest thing I've
ever seen in my life it's so small asked
is this Bobby Brown corrector in light
bisque next we've got the honest Razia
dip brow pomade the reason I got this
I've used it a few times I don't have
the brows where you just need to really
go to town in sculpted shape and all
that but everybody liked it so I just
wanted to try it sue me
next I got this Too Faced shadow
insurance primer I'm so excited use this
I got it in the shade champagne this
just kind of put all over your eyelids
and apparently it gives you a real
nice like globe but I also like Prime oh
praise okay just praise me a moment
uh-huh this is not what I was praising
this is the wrong thing oh just a minute
I got the Urban Decay makeup setting
spray cooling and hydrating I've never
tried this but I heard really really
great things so maybe we should phrase
this but this is not what I thought
this is praise this is the tatcha
luminous dewy skin mist so Jaclyn hill
was talking about this on her channel
and I've been like wanting a really long
time I never got around to getting it
and now I got it and it's just so
excited to use it it apparently sprayed
on and it just gives you like the glow
is most dewy look ever I also got the
Clinique stay matte sheer pressed powder
and finally I feel like I'm always
enemies but I just got the Kat Von D
tattoo liner you guys haven't seen my
favorite liquid eyeliner I love it and a
story the beloved Mac I bought a bunch I
just posted this on Twitter like this
box full of stuff and I videos like you
better be doing a video how little do
you guys know I'm filming all right now
actually I just told somebody that on
Twitter first let's start with mac
mineralize skinfinish I've got like four
these are three of these the first one
is in the shade little glow and it's
like this beautiful bronze ish gold um
can we just can we just like appreciate
it's like so beautiful next I've got
another glass of pressed powder we're
going to come back to that I've got this
mac mineralize skinfinish in the shade
lightscapade guys my hair you're just
gonna have to love me for who I am it's
like a really pearly highlight though so
if you like that white yeah you've got
to like that white Sheen cuz that is no
born without a straight pearl I've also
got Mac mineralize skinfinish in the
shade gold deposit which is like the
most beautiful bronze ish golden shade
it just looks like summer in a makeup
product right I also got the Mac Pro
Longwear powder this is just a pressed
powder in
a shade light plus a little Y for my
skin as you can see I will be using this
to highlight under my eyes and set
concealer to keep that frightful which
I'm okay with I don't feel it switch
money because I always concealer
slipping off increasing so that is going
to be fall I've also picked up the Mac
strobe cream which is apparently just
like the gosh what's called the luminous
by L'Oreal
it's like the white one the luminous uh
but a lot on my voice called I'm sure I
just broke my back broke my back felt
ripped up Mac's Paint Pot in the shade
what shade soft ochre and everybody on
YouTube that has a beauty channel rages
about this right and I've just never
tried it I feel really out of the loop
I'm pretty like and I'm and I'm not and
then I just got some concealers so I got
the Pro Longwear concealer in the shade
NC 30 which is the darkest one and I'm
just going to show you one of them what
they look like and you might think
you're wasting your money I got three of
these concealers and it's not waste of
money if you collect makeup I know that
sounds so bad women get so much crap for
that but I got it in n59 2930 I did it
on my shade I don't like this sound
justified as to why I bought through the
same concealers I don't think there's a
really good I don't have a justification
um I can't just find this I don't know
why I bought through the same concealers
but to be fair and 15 really highlight
and 20 will give me that lighter effect
and n30
not just like into him perfectly so at
least all of them I can use but now I
just know that I'll probably only ever
get and 20 cuz it's that perfect in
between I just didn't know I don't know
I'll probably give any 15 to my sisters
and she has a little more favor
and I'm 32 my mom she was darker skinned
BAM screw you guys that we're going to
get me hate I figured it out
I bought presents for my family I'm
accident that's good because thanks for
looking I also brought this mac
prolongwear concealer again oh this one
of these doors a lip color I thought it
was a concealer um I got this amazing
lip color in the shade high drama and
it's like this vampy red purple it's
really purple actually Wow look at that
um I've also got another lip thing in
the shade aimed to please and it's kind
of like a lip pencil right next to that
purple got another lip color in this
shade among the fireflies I'm absolutely
in love with it's just a beautiful brown
brownish nude this is just the perfect
kind of really really really mellow
purple undertone and it's amazing so
that what was I doing so that is it for
my Mac whole bit and for thank you guys

up and if you want to see a get ready
