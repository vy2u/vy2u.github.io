hope you guys are having a great day
today I am doing I feel like I just did
day so many times in that sentence today
I'm doing a huge does anybody notice how
much I move my hands when I'm trying to
like describe and talk it's really
annoying I'm like - back today I'm doing
a forever 21 clothing haul and
everything is from forever 21 I
literally ordered it a couple days ago
so everything should still be there but
I will have direct links to everything
down below is all online and of course
this will be a try on haul I haven't
tried on all the pieces myself so I
don't know if they're gonna fit all this
stuff is really really good and I didn't
know it was going to go out of stock or
anything and I just wanted to like show
it so you guys could get your hands on
it and everything of course is super
affordable since it is from forever 21
and I really feel like I picked out the
pieces that kind of just look high-end
you guys want to see the haul then just
keep watching and please don't forget to
subscribe I'll have a button right here
that you guys can click if you're on a
laptop but if not you guys should just
hit the subscribe button down below um
and yeah let's get started and I hope
you enjoy I'm going to show you the
first thing I see and it's just this
little black bodysuit and it is super
cute well I don't know how it looks on
how it has a v-neck I don't have a
v-neck bodysuit so I wanted one because
I think it would be really cute to like
layer chokers and a men for the snap
bottom this way you don't have to take
off all your clothes when you go key so
that's cool and also I got this in a
size small and it was 1290 another
little shirt I got if you guys know me
you know I'm obsessed with turtlenecks
or mock mics or anything that just kind
of like rises up above your neck a
little bit
so this shirt is so cute to me I need a
new vocabulary I feel like all youtubers
since everybody kind of like watches
each other everybody just as cute
because nobody uses other words this is
called the knit top and cream slash
black in a size small this is an I know
it is 1990 so basically $20 so I thought
that would look really cute tucked into
like
and like a cool jacket okay I'm gonna
grab the accessory that I've been
wanting to show these glasses are so
good
they're like vintage I know they're a
little bit weird and some people would
feel weird wearing them but I don't care
really what people think but my style
and this is like very me and I would
completely wear these everywhere in
anywhere so um I would islas went to a
high school party and I'm sure people
thought it was weird but they're cool
it's my style okay I'm gonna go on with
jeans I'm gonna really kind of show this
more in the actual Tryon portion cousins
are a little bit hard to show on camera
but these are in a size small once again
and they were $32 so really really good
price my all-time favorite piece right
here is this really big cozy blue
sweater this is like my favorite color
right now for clothes and sweaters and
everything this blue mock neck sweater
and it is just really comfortable and
it's not super overside but it's not
tight at all it's like a nice fitting
semi oversized sweater the back is also
really cool because it has like a cut in
the box oh and you could just wear like
a pretty lace bra let you can wear this
over a shirt um but you do see them back
a little bit open I've probably been
happier if it was just closed so it's
like a normal sweater but I think it's
so really cool and trendy and cute it's
what the kids wear these days she's
getting it I'm literally 17 the next
sweater is also a mock neck and it's
just in this beige color I think this
would be really cute tucked in to black
skinny jeans like black high dry skinny
jeans a black boot and then a black
bomber jacket I got this white
turtleneck kind of cream actually and
guess who got foundation all over it
when they tried it on last night
it's just like a white sweater top isn't
super oversized so it does fit you like
the top but I think this is again really
cute with just jeans it's something
casual and sneakers I love turtlenecks
as you probably know if you watched my
channel a lot I'm like always in some
sort of turtleneck or mock neck for
another pair of jeans I was really
excited about these so I
I'm kind of bummed that they don't fit I
got them in a small just I'm playing
denim jeans with rips all along it and
then I would cut the bottoms and I think
they're so cute but they're literally
huge like they're so big I cannot even
pass wearing them so I probably won't
show this in the try on just because it
doesn't look good at all but I do really
want to get them hemmed lastly for jeans
I love these jeans they really do fit
and I like how they're not high rest for
once took like this and they have two
huge rips right here I know some people
don't like these and they just think
they look like somebody cut holes in
your jeans and like what's the point
any time I wear ripped jeans my grandma
always is like Oh Olivia did somebody
cut your jeans I'm like no grandma it's
the style I also got this really fun
shirt this is someone like me and if you
also again watch my videos a lot you
would know like oh yeah you would never
wear that it has too much like color in
the boscoe's but actually maybe you
think I'd buy this I don't know and
you'll see in the Tryon but I think it's
fun the last three things I'm going to
show you guys are so good and I'm really
proud I found them all I'm gonna start
with my absolute favorite thing in the
world and you're going to see how good
this looks in the tryout portion I've
been looking for an oversized denim
jacket for I don't even know how long
like I could not find it anywhere I know
a lot of people get them from like
thrift stores and stuff but for me I
just couldn't find one I really wanted a
good one and forever 21 I had I don't
think they called it an oversize denim
jacket but I decided to order one size
up so I got it in a size medium and it
is literally the perfect
distressed oversized denim jacket and
where my girls are guys um that live in
the cold I wanted to kind of get
something because I do go to cold places
during the winter time for vacation so
I'm definitely going to bring this with
me was $48 and it's just like a big
jacket like a big puffy jacket but it is
I got in a size small you're going to
see it in the Tryon once again it's just
this big puffy jacket and then this
leaves are kind of like not furry but
like a little bit like I don't know how
to drive it lastly to finish up my
forever 21 haul I have purchased this
really cute velvet bomber jacket and it
is $19 and it's in a burgundy shade if I
could do this over again I would
probably size up I got in a size small
but you guys know that I love umm
oversized things that is everything from
forever 21 I hope you guys enjoyed this
video I am really excited that I found
all these pieces from one store
obviously this is not sponsored I bought
everything with my own money from here I
just wanted to share it with you guys

need to put this up yeah thank you so
