today I am doing a Twitter Q&amp;amp;A I haven't
done this in forever
I owned on a Twitter Q&amp;amp;A for eight
months that is so weird to me that went
by really fast so I am back coming to
film one for you guys I have an
announcement really quickly before we
get into the video I have created a
posting schedule this is something that
needed to be done because your girl is
now on summer actually this one
when you're watching this I won't be on
summer yet but I'm about to be on summer
so starting this upcoming Wednesday I
will have my posting schedule my posting
days are gonna be Wednesday and Sunday
so twice a week you can expect a video
on Wednesdays and Sundays I'm really
gonna try and not let you guys down and
really excited about this so some days
if I'm sick or something yeah it might
be hard to film but at least videos once
a week and then I'm hoping that I can
really keep up like this Wednesday
Sunday schedule I asked you guys to ask
me questions with the hashtag Pascal
Jade which is literally what I used to
do all the time when I was obsessed with
Twitter CUNY's first question is what's
your favorite clothing item my favorite
clothing item
I'd have to say oversized sweatshirts hi
Olivia I love your videos and my
question is what is your favorite thing
to do with your friends thank you and
everything to do with my friends is get
lunch go to the beach and now what are
your summer plans as of now my summer
plans this is what I want to talk about
VidCon I will be at VidCon at the end of
June I believe it's June 24 it is when
it starts whatever that Thursday is and
then it goes till Saturday I really do
hope that I can meet at least a little
bit of you guys will you ever do a UK
Meetup sending you a big hug from the UK
I love you I love you too that question
was from Sabrina since I have about 180
thousand subscribers right now it would
be kind of hard to do a meet-up just
because everybody's so spread out you
know but that's why great things like
VidCon and those kind of
mansions will be really really nice to
go to any advice for me I have a YouTube
but having posted in a long time because
I feel too shy I think you just need to
go for it and post because the only
person that really judges you is you
because people could judge you for a
quick minute or two minutes or four days
but eventually what are they gonna keep
saying oh she's a new YouTube video oh
look how funny this one is oh my god
like it gets old look people are not
gonna want to listen to them anymore
it's dumb so the only person that's
stopping you from posting is you so I
can encourage you to just get out there
post a video and just do your thing like
you like it you should do it okay
we're not allowed you a hangout on like
Sundays or Saturdays I don't really know
wherever I'm feeling wherever my friends
are and like no ask Olivia Jade but you
ever have a meet-up in LA I totally
would I feel like that's kind of what
VidCon in this book what I'm not having
like an exact meet-and-greet or anything
but I'll be walking around a lot so
hopefully you guys will see me I'll be
roaming around my hotel I'll just be out
I'm doing something on stage with
awesome Stevie so you guys can come to
that when I get more details I'll let
you know but basically that's what's
going on right now anyway that's it for
my Q&amp;amp;A thank you so much for watching
thank you so much for tweeting in and
asking me questions I love you guys so
much and I'm so excited for VidCon if
you're gonna be there thank you so much
for watching I love you guys so much
please don't forget to like this video
if you enjoyed it it really helps me out
and then also subscribe if you haven't
already we are so close to two hundred
thousand I'm so proud of you guys and
I'm so proud of me so I love you and
I'll see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
