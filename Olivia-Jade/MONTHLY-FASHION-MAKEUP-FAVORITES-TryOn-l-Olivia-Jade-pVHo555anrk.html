my youtube channel in today's video I am
going to be talking about my favorites I
have so many fashion and makeup and
skincare faves that I am so so so
excited to share with you guys I feel
like it's been a while since we really
sat down and talked through about my
favorite products and my favorite
clothing items and like the best things
I could possibly find right now I am
going to show you guys so if you guys
want to see some really like
fashion-forward pieces what I think is
super chic some amazing skincare and
makeup products that will probably
change your life for the better just
keep watching if you new don't forget to
subscribe and turn on my post
notifications and let's get started I
think I want to start with skincare and
makeup product and stuff like that first
just because I have it over there and a
really easy contained case and it's
gonna be easy to pull things out of it
so let's start with that
okay so first I want to talk about this
micellar water it's the simple sensitive
skin water boost micellar cleansing
water with minerals and plant extract
and now you might be thinking okay
what's important about in my cellar
water there are so many different
micellar waters at the drugstore and in
Sephora and all these different places
but what I love about this is there's no
artificial perfume or color or anything
that's kind of really horrible for your
skin in other micellar waters there's an
ingredient called polyomino propyl big
you and i i think that's what it's
called
I'm pretty sure I actually was
researching it on my phone earlier one
second poly amino propyl fig you and I'd
I don't know if I'm pronouncing it right
but basically it's an ingredient that's
in a lot of micellar waters and it's an
antibacterial so it's gonna kill
bacteria on your skin and that's why
they use it in makeup and skincare
products but it is a harsh product that
you shouldn't be using on your skin
I know it's banned from a lot of
companies and cosmetic lines there's
evidence based on results of studies on
humans and animals that pH M B which is
just the abbreviated form is
carcinogenic which is cancer causing and
mutagenic which is causing gene mutation
and it's toxic so that's why I wanted to
talk about this I want you guys to
always be safe with what you're using if
you love micellar water there are some
out there that are natural and better
for you and this one
not have that ingredient so so I fear
the little ramp but I don't want you
guys to be putting toxins in your body
that are so easy to avoid so I know
Garnier has this ingredient in it I know
a lot of you guys use the Garnier
micellar water because I know a lot of
youtubers talk about that one so I would
just stay away from all that just get a
nice healthy clean one that's good for
your skin okay so next you guys are
always asking what I use for my hair
care routine I have been loving this
Amazon Beauty beauteous power rock ooh
colorful conditioner and the shampoo I
don't I'm watching the pronunciation of
the name the difference between this
type of shampoo and a drugstore type of
shampoo is that I feel like when I use
one from the drugstore my hair
automatically becomes like brittle and
dried out and it dries like a little bit
frizzy err and it's not as tamed and
it's hard to brush through and even when
I was getting my hair done with my hair
stylist she was like when's the last
time you washed her hair and I was like
I literally just washed it like a couple
hours ago she's like it's already greasy
what shampoo are you using and that's
when I learned that drugstore shampoos
and conditioners summed some I'm sure
are really great but some of them
actually are not great for your hair and
they don't work and you don't see the
benefits and this is a little bit
pricier it's on Amazon but I highly
recommend it it smells amazing it
literally smells divine and it's really
really good for your hair and it makes
it feel really soft it says made with
certified organic ingredients free of
parabens sulfates and gluten it's
natural and vegan next this product I
want to talk to you guys about it's
called an eyebrow razor you can get them
super cheap off of Amazon but basically
if you guys don't know this about me I
do laser hair removal and when you laser
you can't wax in between so sometimes
it's like it's totally not well feels
like peach fuzz above your lip or on
like your side of your face or whatever
it is like every single person on the
planet I like doing this because then
you can just like it away and you're
nice and smooth and soft and clean and
makeup goes on way better and I know a
lot of people literally like shave their
face with this I don't do that I do like
around my mouth and stuff so if you have
a lot of peach fuzz and waxing is too
expensive or laser hair removal is too
expensive try these out you can get them
on Amazon I'll lengthen
I'll link everything down below but I
think they're really great and they're
so so cheap and you can use them
multiple multiple times so I hope this
helps next this skincare product is one
of my all-time faves it's a fresh peony
brightening night treatment masque
I just apply this at nighttime and when
you wake up your skin is glowing you
sleep with this on after you've cleansed
your skin and toned and whatever you do
you're gonna wake up literally feeling
like a glowing goddess so 10 out of 10
would recommend this product it might be
a tiny bit expensive but it smells
amazing oh my gosh it literally smells
like a spa and it works really well so
next I have been loving these sheet
masks from Sephora collection this one's
the rose one my favorite is the white
one it's the coconut one I believe I'm
currently out of this so this is like my
other favorite one this is the ultra
moisturizing and brightening you just
lay this on your face you look like a
mummy for like 15 minutes yeah 15
minutes and your skin literally is
glowing after you rub it in you take the
extra juices and you blend it down your
neck and you look super healthy and
glowy and it's just a really good
product if maybe you've had a late night
out or you're just feeling tired and
you're over it and you just kind of want
to like rejuvenate and Riaan Hance your
skin I feel like this works really well
another skincare product from Sephora
collection is the Sephora blue clay mask
this one's detoxifying and oxygenating
that's a hard word to say you again also
leave this on for 15 minutes and I just
paint this all over my face let it sit I
respond to emails I edit videos I do
whatever I need to do but I really love
using this just for like a quick
downtime apply it on your face it works
really well no bad words to say about
this I also want to talk about these
Sephora collection coconut water
cleansing wipes I believe these are $6
at Sephora or Sephora online I think
they are the most soothing and gentle
face wipes I use the Neutrogena I use
Garnier I'd used all these other ones
but I feel like they're really rough and
they kind of make my eyes like puff up
around my eyes I just don't like how
they look after I use other facial wipes
so this one's a really gentle one it
takes off all your makeup your mascara
your waterproof your eyeshadow
everything your face makeup those hard
lipsticks I love this
it's six dollars so I don't know how
much Neutrogena is in comparison but I
would seriously recommend these if
you're looking for a semi affordable
wipe these are great I need to talk
about this this is the Palmer's cocoa
butter formula with vitamin E swivel
stick first of all it's just fun cuz it
will literally looks like a giant glue
stick which is like my favorite thing in
the world it is the most moisturizing
product ever I've gone through countless
chop sticks and moisturizers and
Vaseline and eosin all these claimed
amazing moisturizers for your lips and
nothing works for me
the lips still stay chapped until I
found you it's fun to use coz it's like
a giant glue stick a lot of product
comes in it I bought it off Amazon I'll
link it below it's great 10 out of 10
would recommend and I don't think it's
too expensive next I want to talk about
another face mask or I guess is not a
mask it's more like an overnight
treatment this is the glam glow dream
duo overnight transforming treatment so
when you open it up as you can see
there's two sides and on it it's a step
one and step two obviously you start
with the step one which is like this
white cream and then you put the gray
charcoal one over it
I believe it's charcoal that could be so
I don't know if it's charcoal I can't
take it back I don't know what it is
it's great it's amazing you literally
wake up with your skin glowing you look
like you were on vacation and you have
this nice sunkissed summer hydrating
glow Sparkle Sheen to your skin it's
amazing I would definitely recommend
this if you're in the need for a new
nightly treatment I got you okay let's
talk about an amazing liquid lipstick
that I haven't used in way too long and
I have it on my lips right now again and
it is exposed by Kylie cosmetics
you guys this color is perfect I have
tried countless lipsticks and lip liners
and lip glosses and liquid lipsticks and
all the ones that I like like the nude
pinks it's either like too pink or like
a little bit too brownish purple where
it makes my face look a little dead in
the best way to put it I just feel like
kind of makes my under eyes look darker
everything this one is like the perfect
amount of pink and the perfect amount of
brown
and perfect amount of like purplish
brownie undertone and it creates like a
gorgeous nude I feel like it still makes
my face look super alive and healthy but
it just gives a nice little color and I
love it so I put it on and I was like
holy crap I forgot about this and now I
have to tell them
love just a few more things for skin
hair and makeup first I use this tinted
moisturizer by Laura Mercier literally
every single day I wear makeup I put
this in my everyday makeup routine if
you haven't seen that video I will link
it down below but this product is
awesome
it just has like a really light to
medium coverage it even got my
complexion it matches me perfectly when
I'm fake tanned
and I don't know I just really like this
I think it's like wait I love applying
this with a kabuki brush I love this
product it's great it provides light
coverage to medium coverage so if you
want full coverage I definitely don't
recommend it but if you just want a
really natural look it literally just
looks like a second set of skin it just
a little bit better lastly for product I
guess you could say I use this Bondi
sans the Australian tan self tan eraser
okay I've talked about what I use on my
body all the time for an actual self
tanner and that's my loving tan that's
and I go to my literal favorite my
number one I use that for actual tanner
along with the loving tan mitt but I
really like the Bondi sans eraser for
when I've had the loving tan one on for
about a week and it's time to reapply a
tan I use this little eraser to put it
in spots where my tan looks patchy or
where it's clung to or anywhere that I
just need to be gone I use this
directions are on the back if you want
to get it you can see for yourself but
it just takes off that extra layer of
tan so when I reapply my new tan it
looks perfect now I'm going to move on
to fashion and accessories and all that
fun stuff for you guys I have some
really great fashion-forward friends I'm
going to try on the pieces for you guys
so you can see what I'm talking about or
if I don't try them on all insert a
picture of me wearing it let's start
with sunglasses I had never heard of
this brand and then randomly I just kind
of found it it's called a rock or of sea
I think it's an Australian brand but I
love these glasses
I think these glasses are really in
right now I love like the thick black
frame and then
like the pinkish red tinted lens I've
seen these a bunch on like friends of
mine and I think they're really cool you
guys my friend Blake so shout out to you
Blake but everyone has been copying you
so I joined the bandwagon oh my god guys
I was gonna put this in because I was
waiting to do like my workout video with
my trainer slash nutritionist I know
that sounds very LA but you guys have
been asking what I do and now that I
have like an actual professional helping
me with what it's healthy to eat because
before her I was like way too focused on
counting calories and it was not good
and I was going down an unhealthy path
but I have completely changed my
lifestyle my workout routine and what I
put in my body and I feel so much better
and this thing is amazing
this is called a pear PE our heart rate
monitor you strap it around under your
sports bra and as you can see on the
back it has these little they're
basically sensors to get your heart rate
going and then this part you have to
order the batteries it doesn't come with
batteries my trainer gave it to me
basically you get the app pair and it
completely tracks your heart rate and
then like how many calories you burn
during the workout and also it tells you
like what zone you're in on a workout I
can't show you since I'm not working out
right now so it goes from zones 1 to 5
and you enter your weight and your
height and it kind of like adjust to
your body and then there's an actual
calibration you can do on a treadmill
that like perfectly adjust it to your
body but I did that with my trainer I
don't know how to do that
by myself I'll have a video with my
trainer soon and she'll explain more in
depth about this amazing thing but
anyway it gives you a zones from zone 1
to 5 and then if you're in his own one
you're not really working hard enough
and if you hit a zone 5 you're in a
sugar burning zone and you want to be in
a fat-burning zone to have effective
results so that's zoned 2 3 &amp;amp; 4 if you
guys want me to do a full workout
routine and talk more about this amazing
heart rate monitor let me know because I
definitely will but this has been
keeping me just motivated and so happy
when I workout just seeing the progress
and knowing that I'm burning fat and not
sugar so I absolutely love this let me
know if you guys want a video more in
depth about my workout and how this is
effective and how it's made results like
really evident
really
quickly let's talk about two a little
purses that I absolutely love and are
staples and aren't too crazy expensive
okay I take it back they're expensive
they're like $50 or so I believe but
they're high-quality and they're great
size and they're looking like designer
bags and I'd rather pay 50 than a couple
thousand and I think you would too so
first let's start with this little black
one it's from Lulu's and it comes with a
crossbody strap so if you want to have a
strap so it becomes like around your arm
or whatever you don't want to like hold
it like this whole time it does come
with that option I just think this bag
is absolutely stunning and it's so
classy and I feel like it's kind of
timeless because it's just plain black
it goes with everything so I got this
from Lulu's I'll link it down below if
they still have it on their website or
I'll link something similar from Lulu's
or another bag if they don't have this
one I got you guys just always look at
my description because I always hook you
up down there I also want to talk about
a pop of color this little red bag from
Lulu's this also came with a crossbody
strap I believe yep it's in the bag so
and I absolutely love this for a pop of
color with an all black outfit or an all
white outfit or however you decide to
use and carry and style these two bags I
think they're a better price than like a
couple grand obviously I mean they're no
Target bags you can't go in and get him
for like 10 or 15 bucks but they're
fashion-forward and sheet and a splurge
a little bit but it's totally worth it I
don't even know where to start I have so
many fun clothing pieces and shoe items
that I am just so stoked to share with
you what serve these fun boots these
crazy fun boots I got off of forever 21
and they are so similar to a Balenciaga
shoe it's crazy I just love the metallic
silver I think this is really fun with
like a white crop top your vintage
Levi's and then just like a silver pump
maybe like that cute little black bag I
think it just looks awesome they're
different they're fun they're affordable
and they are very comfortable which is
so important I'll link them down below
if they still have them I know Zara had
a similar pair but these ones are
obviously more inexpensive because it's
forever 21 okay so I want to talk about
these because if you're tinier and you
want a little bit of height but you
don't want it to look too obvious these
vans are amaze
they are platformed you already know
these was like the old-school classic
style but I love this because it has a
slight platform to it so it makes you
taller I wear these all the time they're
obviously really comfortable they're
just a sneaker I just wanted to bring
these to YouTube to light if no one knew
about them and wanted a little bit of
height and the regular size platform
wasn't gonna cut it for you I got you
okay
so the next thing I want to talk about
are these really cute sneakers they are
very similar I would definitely say
they're a dupe for the Balenciaga
sneaker the Balenciaga sneakers first of
all are like almost $1000 I think and
second well they're almost impossible to
get they're literally sold out
everywhere oh wait no I think they're
like five or six hundred whatever the
price is they're expensive and they're
really hard to get I tried to buy them
for my sister for her birthday when they
came out and I couldn't get them because
they were sold out everywhere but my
sister actually found a really similar
pair on shopbop I believe I believe
they're Jeffrey Campbell and they're
basically the same exact shoe except
they just don't have bullets Yaga
written on it and who the hell cares
about that so they're very comfortable I
think they're very cute and chic and I
wanted to share them with you because
it's a really great not only Duke but
it's way easier to access now we can
move on to a clothing so first I want to
talk about this I am gia top this is
just the absolute best most amazing
fitted top I've had in a really long
time I got it in a size small for those
of you wondering and it just like goes
off your shoulders a little bit it ties
up it's so cute I wore it in I think my
last videos so I really love this I got
it off of princess Polly I believe and I
have a code with fences Polly I'll put
it right here it's just Oh Jay 20 it
doesn't benefit me at all but I do work
a lot with princess Polly so I have a
discount code and I love them and they
sell a lot of I am Gia which is one of
my favorite brands at the moment who
doesn't love a good sweater first I want
to talk about this one I got off Urban
Outfitters the brand is oh it's actually
ever been off winners brand too and it's
just this really cute striped it's
almost like a turtleneck it's like a
little bit of a cowl neck meets
turtleneck and it's just so soft
and warm and thick and comfy and it's
been a favorite of mine recently so I
wanted to share with you guys another
favorite of mine rockin take off the
hanger you'll see in the Tryon is this
massive H&amp;amp;M sweater I tried this on in a
haul for Black Friday I got this for
literally like 20 bucks and it's so
comfy and soft and oversized and big and
warm and cute and chic and in LA I
didn't even have to wear it with tights
or pants or anything I can literally
just wear it with boots
cuz it's that oversized and it's that
warm in LA but if you live in a colder
climate where it's snowing or something
it's so great for layering and it's just
chunky and thick and it's a neutral so
it matches everything it's a go-to it's
honestly a staple this sweater I wasn't
gonna put in the video but my sister was
like please put it in the video it's so
cute and I feel like people are gonna
want to know where it's from
I wear the sweater with Casper when I
filmed that video with Caspar Lee on our
channels
it's from Urban Outfitters I believe yes
it is just like this nice chocolatey
brown with some cute stripes along the
edges I wish it was softer I'm gonna be
honest but it is really cute on and it's
not like uncomfortable I just love soft
soft soft things so the last few things
I'm going to talk about are also
obviously clothing pieces this little
getup I'm not gonna try it on but I do
have an Instagram photo in it so I'll
insert the picture right here it's just
like a very clueless vibes two-piece
jumpsuit kind of thing but it's not a
jumpsuit cuz it's two separate things it
just ties around and it's so cute and it
looks great on so I had to throw it in
there I also wear the pants by
themselves all the time with like black
crop tops and white cropped tops then
it's just different and out there if
you're trying to be different if you're
afraid of being different with your
clothing I'm telling you to go for it
cuz I have so much fun when I dress
weird and different you know I swear I
had no other words than different I
don't know why they came out so much so
the last piece I want to talk about are
these black high-rise Levi's they're
called the 721 high-rise skinny the
waist size is 25 and the length is 30
and they fit perfectly they're just
super high-rise way above your belly
button all the way down to your ankle
and they just look so cute on and I love
them and I think they're the perfect
high-rise black Jean so if I can find
them I will definitely link them below
for you guys but I know I was in the
market for a black chain for a really
long time and I never could find the
perfect one that goes high enough and
all things like that and I feel like I
found them once so guys that's it for
