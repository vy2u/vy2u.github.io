my channel today I'm filming a Q&amp;amp;A for
you guys it's kind of wanted to do
something where I sat down and I just
kind of talked to you guys and caught up
with you guys because a lot of people
have been asking for me to do more
personal videos like the TMI tag room
tour that kind of stuff which is all
coming up in the near near future but
for now I just wanted to stick to a Q&amp;amp;A
and answer some questions all right
first question is what is your favorite
spring /summer accessory my favorite
spring /summer accessory is definitely
amazing so even though that's kind of
like an outfit but I had the beach or
the pool or in the jacuzzi or just
constantly I'm always in a bathing suit
especially in the summertime you will
probably not catch me a day without a
bathing suit on so yeah definitely a
bathing suit I can't cough alright if
you didn't live in Cali where would you
live this is a question by John Stamos
fans probably the south so like a nice
southern boy get married have kids those
ideal now probably like New York just
because it has a really Los Angeles feel
to it
what place have you always wanted to
visit but you hadn't had the chance to
yet by Elektra that's what you call it
dyslexia Isla Grande you're Ben's Bora
Bora for sure hands down or Fiji just
somewhere really tropical with a
beautiful ocean are you all excited for
summer and who is your favorite music
artist oh I'm so excited for summer are
you excited for summer
I would imagine you're excited for
summer too because that means no school
and that means yes and my favorite music
artist is probably I really like cute
Cudi
favorite clothing shoes accessories
stores alright I'm just going to change
that question your favorite clothing
store just in general because it was
like favorite clothing shoes and
accessories then I would just have to be
like a department store like Barney's
gloaming
Oh Bolan or Chum Neiman whatever for
everything Buffalo 50 about I really
like but I really don't like it's like
Oh favorite holiday Christmas for sure
right after my birthday because clearly
a really big national holiday but
Christmas might be a little bit bigger
you could only have one make a product
what would it be I would probably only
have concealer or eyeliner no eyeliner
because concealer and foundation clog
your pores so I mean if you just get
more sleep and I can soon stuff you can
kind of get rid of bags I'm like clear
up your skin you don't need that stuff
necessarily but eyeliner if you just
need to make your eyes pop then amen
what are you wearing at the moment well
I'm wearing this black t-shirt then I'm
wearing sweat pants and you have one
power what would it be if I could have
one power it would probably be too fly
false false maybe to go like this and be
able to transport somewhere else
favorite song favorite song at the
moment ah shout out to one of my really
good friends Oscar his SoundCloud is
Austin Adler I wasn't linked down below
I've been using the end of his or parts
of his song or his remix to say my name
and he just does a bunch of remixes he's
a really really good DJ once again

downbar you guys should go follow it so
talented I'm not even kidding like also

just yeah that's all my favorite song
anything that you remix because talented
talented Oscar what's your favorite
Disney movie by the way is Lee ha le -
um my favorite Disney movie easy Aladdin
now Lion King or Cinderella I don't know
they're all really good but what's your
favorite just movie what's your favorite
makeup brand remember makeup brand is
probably warmer see a Bobby Brown Chanel
Mac and drugstores Maybelline and
L'Oreal do you have a crush on anyone I
don't know you have a crush on somebody
that's a real question has anyone
recognized you from your channel is so
what was it like the first time I was
recognized ever in my life was like a
couple months ago and it was at a nail
salon I was just getting my nails done
and somebody came out to me with my glue
a general - oh my god yeah and then I
like fam drooled over them because I was
just so excited I was like ah oh my god
they're like oh my god and it was really
cool so shout up to you if you were the
girl I met in the nail salon thank you
so much for coming up to me you made my
life let's ever forget you
and so that was like my first first time
meeting somebody and then it's something
about to me when I was at lunch with my
mom and her little sister was a fan of
full house so they like to envision my
mom but she just came up to me and was
like I like it YouTube channel so I
guess like I was kind of for my mom
actually and another time I was at
Coachella and a little girl came up to
me and she was so freaking cute and her
outfit was so cute and chat like this
huge floppy hat on she came up and
showed me she liked my videos so he took
a little salty together and it was so
awesome so thank you to the girls that
have come up to me because if you ever
see me please don't be afraid of me I am
literally I bet I'm more excited to see
you than you are to see me I'm not even
kidding I get so shine it off my sister
after you got the walk oh my god okay
next question

saddest movie I've ever watched my life
Freaky Friday moment who would you
switch with I really like this question

trivia dare with Mariah I think I would
definitely switch with Jimmy Fallon good
two more questions chocolate or vanilla
