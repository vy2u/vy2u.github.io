channel today I'm filming my skincare
routine I hate myself anyway today for
my skincare routine and basically I have
an abundance of products at your service
in this little container and it's gonna
be a party I have so much stuff in here
that you guys are probably like because
she's lying to us she doesn't use this
every night
I'm not lying to I don't use this every
night I just showed you all the possible
things that I would use so people stop
asking for this video I'm bringing it to
you now live June 24th Wednesday at 2:20
yeah I kind of explained that I don't
use everything in here but all these
products I do use at least once a week
it just kind of changes out because I
don't have like a ritual for my skincare
except for like three products that I
always use
let's start with how I take off my
makeup at night these are a must I use
these every night if I'm wearing makeup
it's my Neutrogena make really hey
Neutrogena makeup remover cleansing
towelettes refill pack do they refill
these for you what no no no no no this
is what I use very first to take off my
makeup before I use my cleansers or
anything like that this is like even if
I change up my cleansers whatever this
is something I will always use got it
good the next thing I will use to make
sure I don't have any leftover makeup on
my face no more traces you know I use a
micellar water this is my Garnier
micellar water which is empty so
I also have my Bioderma micellar water
which I use I got this off of Amazon and
just one that I have in my local
drugstore is the simple sensitive skin
experts cleansing micellar water this is
what I use after my Neutrogena
towelettes and I just put these on a
cotton pad and then just rub it all over
my face and it removes all my makeup so
because of course these are going to
remove the majority of your makeup but
it's not going to remove every single
little thing you know and this removes
everything this is something I use every
single night whether I'm changing up my
cleansers or not these are rock steady
that made no sense but I just don't
change these out okay you go I'm saying
something that I use most of the time is
my purity one-step facial cleanser
simple cleanser I use this because it's
actually a makeup remover and it's a
one-step facial cleanser so basically it
removes your makeup and cleanses your
skin it's like a two-in-one it's like
shampoo and conditioner made into one
for your face I cut all of this out
Bella don't worry
anyway I know this is what I use to be
cool that made no sense okay so anyway
this is just the facial cleanser I
always use stick it on my goo puffs
which I got from Amazon for like seven
dollars I think and you just this is
kind of like a Beauty Blender once you
run it under water it expands it comes
like a little very hard tiny rock and
then it expands and gets all soft and
spongy and then you put it on and
exfoliate your skin it works wonders I
love it so these are a solid combo I'm
really really obsessed with it and it
smells amazing too and I really like how
it just kind of melts the makeup off
your face but it also cleanses your skin
so it's a really really really very very
insanely good face wash Bella here wants
to smell it so if I'm not feeling my
Thunder that I was just showing you or
drop it up no surprise right because I'm
always dropping stuffing if I don't use
that I use my Lancer the method polish
sensitive skin or the method cleanse for
sensitive skin I've been using that
simple one more but these are oldies
that are just very trustworthy and they
are a sponsor of so if you don't like to
splurge on skincare this is probably not
the video for you because most of my
stuff is kind of expensive because I'm
just really really really really really
obsessed with skincare this is another
kind of cleanser makeup remover thing
that I like to use it's my Colleen
Rothschild radiant cleansing balm this
stuff is expensive it's really expensive
for Real Talk it's expensive I ordered
off of Amazon after watching
kathleenlights skincare video I
purchased this and I also purchased that
simple cleanser because her skin so
pretty
oh this stuff smells so nice as you can
see I've made a little indent and this
is if I've got a full face of makeup on
and I am going out what if I'm taking my
makeup off this is something that I use
to remove makeup if I'm not using my
Neutrogena wipes or if I just really
really really need to make sure on the
makeup is off my face I use my ponds
cold cream cleanser or if I'm just out
really late and I'm coming back home
really late at night and I don't want
I'm never coming back home really late
okay I don't know why I said that I
don't have friends I don't have a life
it's just if I'm lazy to be honest was
embarrassing um cold cream cleanser it's
a great product
it's a cleanser and - makeup remover in
one and it smells good if you get in
your eyes you feel blind for only 50
minutes and you're going I'm kidding it
just gets a little blurry so avoid
getting it in your eyes unless you like
that blurry if you want to feel like you
can't see for a couple minutes I suggest
for rubbing this in your eyeballs
another product that I like using to
remove I me
is my andrea IQs make remover pads this
is if i have mascara on or eyeliner on
or waterproof makeup on like in my eyes
that is just not coming off with
anything this is a great makeup remover
they are super oily so i use this very
in the very beginning I probably should
have showed this way earlier but I'm
showing it now
um I use this before washing my face and
everything like that and it is wonderful
now I also use my Madi skincare zinc and
sulfur mask if my skin feels a little
whack I use this like twice a week but
it's a really really really amazing
thick face mask that you just put all
over your face wait for to dry and then
rinse it off with warm water and after
using this I always feel like my skin is
so refreshed and cleaned out and it just
feels very very very healthy and
hydrated
I love face masks I haven't really tried
any other ones besides this one but I'm
just so in love with this one that I
don't really want to try any other ones
but if you have a good face mask that
you think I would like please feel free
to comment it down below lastly for my
skincare I moisturize my skin with the
lancer the lancer imma lancer the method
Norrish sensitive skin that was risky I
like using this first because of its tub
I mean that it just is so fun to get out
and second it's so lightweight that it
doesn't really feel like you're putting
moisturizer on your face what I also
like about it is that wait what do I
like about it uh it's lightweight
moisturizing oh it's so hydrating that
it makes your skin feel like you're on
top of the world you feel like a
Victoria's Secret model you know how
their face are always really glowy this
is my moisturizer I love this I don't
really notice a difference with
moisturizers so I just kind of use
whatever's in my drawer but this is the
one I use every night I also use like
the hydro care one which is like
whatever so you know what doesn't no
matter what my shows you because they
change so often and it
they don't change so often this is like
the only one I ever use it so yeah but I
don't
notice a huge difference with
moisturizers except that this one just
makes my skin feel so hydrated and I
love the consistency of it the VAT is it
