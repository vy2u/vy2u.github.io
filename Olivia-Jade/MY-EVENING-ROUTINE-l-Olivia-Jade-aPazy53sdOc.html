to my youtube channel you're probably
doing one of my most requested videos
literally in the world like here we go
people
it's my skincare routine I'm actually
really excited to film it and I have to
disclaim that this is sponsored by
Clinique because you guys know I'm very
open about sponsorships but when you see
what's being sponsored I think you're
going to be like
of course she's obsessed with that
product so I was like so excited about
this since I've been using this product
for like six months now I mean it's
already empty so I need to get another
one but yeah if you guys want to see
what I do every single day it's how I
remove my makeup it's how I take care of
my skin it's how I keep it clear then
please keep watching and I hope you
enjoyed so the first thing I want to
talk about is obviously how I remove my
makeup this is literally my ride-or-die
like I'm not saying this because this is
sponsored by Konig I would straight up I
feel like you can tell - when
sponsorships are genuine this product is
everything it's empty - obviously when
I'm out late at night at a party with my
friends whatever my mom has always
taught me no matter what don't go to
sleep with your makeup on because you
need a cleanser face and I don't want to
do the whole makeup wipe then face wash
and then moisturize and then whatever
this kind of does at all if that makes
sense I don't have to use a makeup wipe
I don't have to use mine micellar water
i literally just use this and then i
usually just put moisturizer on that's
like a lazy night if i'm feeling you
know like really getting in my skin i'll
use this and then i'll show you some
other products that i use but this is
like the lazy girl's best friend so if
you know me you know it's perfect
welcome to a brief view at all it
doesn't feel drying it just kind of like
transfers from like an oil to like a
milky consistency you're going to see
when I'm doing a little demo but this is
how I take my makeup off I think
everyone should get this I'm really not
saying this because this videos in
partnership with Clinique I would say
this anyway because this is the greatest
investment I promise you no doubt about
it you will save me I promise you will
thank me I literally can't stop talking
about it my sister used half of mine
which pissed me off but whatever it's
amazing thank you in like Olivia you
need to put a little bit more effort
into your skincare
it will usually go in with Silas looking
at my products I usually go in with a
face wash so you guys know my
ride-or-die forever has been my Lancer
product I mostly keep these in my shower
now because this is the Polish and this
is the cleanse and the polish is like a
beedi consistency and the cleanse is
more of like a silky cleanser so I start
with the polish I kind of like take the
remainders off and then I go in with the
cleanser this is a great duo it is a
little bit pricey but totally worth it
in my book I love Lanson products these
two products kind of have like taken
over after I use my cleansing balm by
Clinique I usually go in with my fresh
products I've been loving these so this
is the fresh soy face cleanser I love
this because it's so gentle so if you
have sensitive skin and you just want
like a nice gentle cleanser I seriously
recommend this it hasn't broken me out
at all I really really like it feels
really hydrating and I also have been
using my French sugar face polish love
this stuff because it's that beauty
consistency so it really feels like
you're kind of scrubbing off all the
dead skin cells after that obviously you
need moisturizer you need to kind of get
that hydration back into your skin I've
been loving my fresh Lotus use preserved
face cream I just got this if you saw my
last haul this is so good I'm literally
obsessing it I think it's amazing I
think it's so lightweight and so
hydrating but at the same time you can
really feel it like working into your
skin so I'm a really big fan of it I
also love my fresh rose hydrating eye
gel cream this is so soothing I just
take like my ring finger and I like kind
of pop this under my eye and it feels
amazing like it literally feels so
refreshing I'm I'm living for it
literally it's great but I love both of
these products together I often find
when I use the same brand together it
really works and mix as well so a little
trick I know and then for the nights
where I'm like I need my face to
literally feel like when I wake up it is
going to be the most hydrated the most
alive has ever been I use this Charlotte
Tilbury magic night cream this feels a
little weird of knocking on line when
you first put it on your face it's like
I can't explain it kind of feels
like silicone II I guess but you wake up
and your skin like still looks like it
has that fresh moisturizer on it if you
need deep hydration like if your skin is
struggling I think you should try this
last two things I want to talk about my
fresh rose floral toner
don't scream that almari would sq okay I
still use that but this has kind of been
like what I've been using lately since
spent my life saving romance
just kidding but it is pretty expensive
so if you're just learning the cheap way
out why would a scoop same thing it's
great it just this is prettier packaging
that's literally it and I just spray
this on my face awesome done with all my
skin care and then if I'm having any
breakouts I will finish off with a
little bit of my Mario Badescu rose
water spray no my god you are way too
used to saying that
I open this up with my Mario Badescu
drying lotion my last concur routine I
use this and I shook it and you're not
supposed to shake it so I've learned my
lesson you just dip the q-tip in and
everyone's actually the whole formula if
you shake it it doesn't work so don't
shake it just put on your little like
blemishes wherever you have a zit or two
and you'll be good to go in a few days
thank you for watching I love you and
I'll see you next time bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
