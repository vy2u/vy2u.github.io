I am teaching you how to get this messy
bun this is so requested I always have
some sort of messy bun in my videos or
sometimes I'll have a messy bun in an
Instagram or Twitter post or something
like that so everybody's always asking
how I get this perfect messy bun and
there are way more Messier buns than
this but I think this is ideal for like
my hair type I it's really big on top
and then it's kind of messy more towards
the front so if you guys want to see how
to get this then just keep watching it's
a really really quick video because
there's not much to it it's super easy
um so yeah let's get started don't
forget to subscribe if you aren't
already I'm posting every single day in
December at 3 p.m. Pacific Standard Time
so if you guys want to see how to get
this look then just keep watching and I
hope you enjoy okay so first off your
hair is probably going to look a little
bit better in a messy bun if it's a
couple days dirty sorry if that's gross
but I like to use this Eisel on without
a trace dry shampoo I also really like
batiste or whatever dry shampoo you have
and then I also have a with this called
hair brush and two hair ties and that's
all you'll need I don't use bobby pins
or anything way too complicated this is
literally supposed to be bam bam so easy
spray like in the roots kind of not
directly on top of your head okay so
after you're done with that I like to
brush out my hair so after I brush on my
hair and put a little dry shampoo
throughout it I take my first hair tie I
finished off with a brown one just
because it matches my head better but
start with this and I'm going to use the
viewfinder I'm putting this on my blog
camera actually because my big camera
died but um it's charging I am looking
at the viewfinder which is on top as my
mirror but basically what I'm going to
do is I'm just gonna what you'll see it
I'm going to pull my hair up pretty
messily and put it in like a messy bun
you'll see what I'm doing I just pull it
up and I make sure that I don't have
bumps on the top of my head just because
I like to mess it
after but I don't want it to like start
messed up if you know what I mean so I
just start by wrapping it around like
this and I just like get it nice and
tight and then I like to pull out my
side little pieces and my front two
pieces and then I'll go back in with my
second hair tie and just place it around
to make sure it's like tight and secured
okay and then I actually twist it shake
it out
that's basically what I do to get my
messy bun it's just kind of big on top
so I don't know if you like that look
but I hope you guys enjoyed this video
thank you for watching I know it was
super quick and then of course to top
off my messy bun you gotta have some big
glasses that is it for my messy bun
tutorial you can really just like play
around with it do what you want
um it's as messy as it's gonna get for
me I hope you guys enjoyed it and this
is like the gist of how I do it it
changes every single time kind of a
little bit what I'm feeling but this is
like the medium ish um messy one but
thank you for watching don't forget to
subscribe and I will see guys next time
