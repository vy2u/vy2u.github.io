today as you can tell by the title I'm
doing my school morning routine um what
I was doing right there just really
quick just to announce this is not my
exact school morning routine because I
don't wear makeup to school and I don't
have free dress I wear a uniform I don't
have to pick out my outfit and I never
do makeup in the morning just because I
don't care
yeah I hope you guys enjoy it I decided
to wear makeup in this video just for
the sake of the video I put an outfit
together so you guys could get an idea
of what I would wear on a free dress
today at my school hope you guys enjoy
this this was my most requested video
that I've been getting is a morning
routine a school one specifically I hope
you guys enjoy it
bye good morning guys I hope you guys
are not as bad as waking up I am I am
literally the worst but I stretch out I
set my alarm well it was that you didn't
hear it obviously because it's all muted
but I usually set my alarm in the
morning in the morning in the morning at
about 7:30 which really isn't that bad I
looked super close to school I stalk you
guys on social media I stalk my friends
you know and then I head to the bathroom
to do skincare and teeth and you know
that so I start by brushing my teeth
hopefully you guys all know how to brush
your teeth so I didn't put long clips
showing how I just kind of showed you a
quick snippet of it and then straight to
skincare the Garnier skin active
micellar cleansing water is a must in
the morning for me this just removes any
excess bacteria or dirt or makeup from
my skin so I love this and then I go
straight in with a face wash after this
I'm using the Maddie European skincare
cleanser this is my favorite cleanser
this is from my facialist Maddie so I
love her she's a great facialist if
you're in LA you guys should check her
out but anyway it just cleanse that
massage it into my face and yeah if you
guys don't wash your face and you're
having skin troubles I swear washing
your face and just doing going the extra
mile to take off your makeup and all
that makes such a big difference it is
huge it's a life changer to wash your
skin because you don't want to have acne
if you can prevent it by just scrubbing
your face at night and then I go in with
a toner I just recently started using
toner but I really like it this one is
also from Maddie skin
care and what I really love about this
is I can feel it working into my skin
because it almost tingles doesn't like
burn my face don't worry but it just
feels really nice and it feels like it's
working and then I use my favorite
lotion which is the hydro care for upset
irritated skin hydro care soothing
lotion this stuff is amazing it's
amazing I love it I used way too much
though so I press it into my skin
usually when I just have a little bit
and then I'm in this part I just kind of
rubbed it over my face cuz I had a lot
of extra and you don't want to waste it
I just wanted to soak into my skin I
just said I didn't want to waste it as I
wipe my hands off on a towel anyway but
yeah usually just I use a little
pea-sized because you do not need a lot
of moisturizer that stuff spreads
girlfriend and then I'm just taking my
hair out I literally don't try at school
it's it's just great but I am just
separating my hair into two I'm about to
teach you how to brush your hair come on
let's go so yep brushing my hair so
wonderful you guys probably all know how
to brush your hair I don't know if
there's like a healthy way to brush your
hair but I am such a mess with my hair
I'm so rough on it so probably why I
have a hundred thousand split ends but
you know what's good and then just make
sure it's super super smooth because I
usually throw my hair up in a messy bun
throughout the day or just do something
with it and if my hair is not smooth
then it just forms kind of like
dreadlocks almost I don't really know
how to describe it but it just gets
super tangled and after I'm done with
that I jumped straight into makeup you
guys know what my makeup routine is if
you watch my everyday makeup tutorial
link will be down below so I didn't show
you what I was doing but I moved
straight on to my outfit which is a
short dress from brandy melville and
white vans Daniel back at it sorry
anytime I see white vans I have to do
that then I head down to the kitchen and
I'm sorry I don't mean to be like some
typical youtuber that always says
they're in a rush and doesn't have time
to eat breakfast but literally that's me
I don't have time to eat breakfast I'm
always so late so I usually just get a
banana or a protein bar and then I head
out my door isn't that interesting the
very requested video for my boring
morning anyway
thank you guys so much for watching I
love you all and I'll see you guys in my
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
