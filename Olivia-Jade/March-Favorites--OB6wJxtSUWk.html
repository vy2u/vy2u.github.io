my channel today I'm filming my March
favorites and I have a combination of
clothing and beauty and accessories and
just stuff and I don't think this videos
gonna be too long just because when I do
my favorites I try to like actually grab
things that I've really really really
really really been loving for the month
not just like oh I need stuff to make up
my favorites like anything that I've
ever mentioned are like hands-down my
favorite favorite favorite favorite
favorite favorite I said favorite things
ever so if you guys do want to see what
I've been loving for the month of March
then just keep watching
I literally wear these shoes with
everything from dresses the pants to
shorts they are so comfortable and they
are just black so they go with anything
they're from forever 21 and a lot of
people think they look like the Vince
ones or I know they're forever 21 I
found them one day and I was like yes oh
I hit my foot I'm saying on the clothes
trend I guess because I only have one
other thing and it's sweatpants because
if you know me like usually in my videos
I'll have like something on from the top
like a nice shirt or not even a nice
shirt just something that like looks
like I like put something cute on I
guess and then like from waist down
which you guys can't see I'm always in
sweats of some sort today I'm gonna
dress but usually I'm in sweats these
sweatpants are aviator nation and they
are the softest things in the world and
they're so comfortable and they're so
like honestly I would wear these out not
like trying to be fashionable but like I
would not be embarrassed about with
these I mean I don't really care what
people think of me when I'm walking
around because half the time wearing
like really ugly stuff but these are my
favorite ever in the world often they're
so comfortable and I wear them usually
every time I'm filming a video and you
don't even know it these sunglasses from
Quay Australia
I think it's clean I feel like you're
pronounced that wrong it up in that
Topshop because they sell play I really
hope that I pronounced it but they're
like a cat eye how cute
I bet it was really weird this is just
my personality in a sunglass like young
cuz of like the light pinkish color like
romantic kind of like a baby
and then like the diva cat eye things
like oh don't don't mess with me I'm not
a diva and then it's like ooh you know
and then lastly for just random is this
Cup I literally have this Cup in every
color you could possibly have it and I
have it in green yellow red that I've
done that blue quo so I got them that
Rite Aid I'm too lazy to go back down
and get that but they're really really
fun to drink at it's like the little
sippy part of it you just feel like
you're three years old
truth I'm moving on to beauty favorites
this is not a beautiful with this case
this is just a random case from Clinique
I don't know how much I like it at all
actually it's kind of kind of like whoa
I'm not really a colors person if you
haven't noticed um the first thing is
the Tresemme perfectly undone wave
creation seafoam talked about this a
little bit in my hair care routine which
was a really boring video I'm sorry I've
gotta watch that I don't think you want
to be bored through the whole thing you
use this after the shower and then you
just put it through your hair and then
you bojayá and it leaves your hair with
like these natural beachy waves I've
used this after the shower without
blow-drying my hair I mean heat on my
hair afterwards and it looked so pretty
soaks like watery or like a watery
substance in the bottle and then when
you spray it on your hand it's foam and
it's really fun and I love it I just got
this it's the Too Faced chocolate Soleil
bronzer in medium deep it's like a light
chocolate ish color obviously I've got
the chocolate Soleil and you put your
brush in this it picks up so much of the
bronzer so you automatically just have a
crap ton of bronzer on the second you
dip your brush in so you do have to use
a light hand with it I like using this
more for bronzing up my face and giving
myself like a sun kissed look rather
than just contouring because I don't
think it leaves a natural shadow it
literally looks like you've been out in
the Sun it really just looks like you've
been out of the Sun you got a little
burned and then I mean it doesn't look
like you got burned because you're not
red but then it just looks like the
after burn where you're like tan and
glowy and if you don't burn because you
can't tan then this will be your new
best friend next we are using the
Smashbox photo-finish
primer in light-weight we are using it
and that my next favorite is this
matchbox photo finish foundation primer
in the light it's the oil-free one and I
meant to get the clear ones but then I
ended up grabbing this one but it's okay
because I'm obsessed with it it
instantly just makes your face look so
smooth and nice the second you put it on
and then your foundation on top of it
lasts so much longer foundation looks so
nice on top of the primer and this
reduces the appearance of fine lines and
pores it leaves you with a matte finish
so it's great I am obsessed with it next
for a highlight I've been obsessed with
the elfs blush and got a glow this is
like a white pearl shimmer color and
it's like almost too much but it reminds
me of a dupe for a Mac highlight which
I'm totally blanking on the name of oh
my lord I've been obsessed with the
L'Oreal Paris True Match super blendable
makeup in neutral natural buff and three
when I first got this I was like whoa I
did not expect it to be so good I like
applying it with my other favorite which
is my Real Techniques sponge and it's
like a Beauty Blender but less expensive
and it comes with a flat side which I
love blend so easily it does not look
cakey it looks super natural it gives a
nice full coverage you don't need to put
layers and layers and layers on but if
you do need layers and layers and layers
it's the most buildable foundation I've
ever used if you're going to top dry or
oily and just somewhere in between this
is the perfect foundation for you more
I've been using it lately I feel like
it's kind of too pink for me almost like
the first time I ever used it I was like
oh my god this is amazing and now looks
gonna pink for me I don't really know
what happened but it's not the
foundation to well I think I just like
picked out the wrong color one time and
I was like standing a different light I
have been loving a lip combo it it's the
sore lip pencil by Mac with the brave
lipstick somebody looks shy now it's
been my favorite combo lately it's dark
it's maulvi it's pink it's amazing I'm
obsessed with it obsessed with these
together I'm obsessed with them alone
they're just very great I have been
loving this next nude matte shadow what
is just a single pot eyeshadow and it
doesn't have the name on it so I don't
know what it's called but if I can find
out I will link it down below it's
basically just a brownish reddish it's
like a ready brown color and it's so
pigmented it's really inexpensive and I
don't know it's really nice and it
blends out real easily it works really
well I'm obsessed with it that's pretty
much awesome it's really good finishing
off with everything for my favorites is
this honest aldia eyebrow pencil in the
color it doesn't send my color on here
but I will link it down below what color
I like about this is if you do mess up
it's just so easy to just rub off with
your finger and then just rush out so I
kind of just I don't really have a
technique except I just kind of go I
just go back and forth and drawing in my
eyebrows which is that's the right way
to do it so that's it for my favorites
