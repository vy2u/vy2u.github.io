mousse in it from trying to do a slick
bun and it just failed so now it's down
but if it looks greasy I washed it last
night
it's just the mousse in my hair so it's
kind of a bummer but I'm trying to work
with what I've got
okay hey guys it's Olivia Jade welcome
back to my youtube channel in a today's
video as you can tell by the title I am
finally doing another clothing haul
because you guys always ask me and I
haven't done one in a hot minute and you
had knows you're always here that here I
mean my channel if you're always looking
at my channel I do clothing off pretty
frequently and it's been longer than
normal with videos in collaboration with
princess Polly they're really cute and
sweet little Australian shop online they
carry so many brands you'll find all
your favorites on there basically so I'm
going to show you what I got from
princes Polly and then I'm also going to
show you guys and what I got from some
other places but let's start with
princess probably since I have the most
from there I do have a discount card
with princess Polly I'll put it right
here and I'll also have it in the
description box it's for 20% off just in
case you guys want to shop there so if
you guys want to see what I got then
just keep watching and if you enjoyed
and now we're going to subscribe so
obviously we're going to start with
Prince with Polly is going to show you
guys is this cute little singlet it's
like a tiny little pop and it's just a
really perfect crop top you guys will
see on the Tryon but it's so soft it's
like the softest silk use material and I
think it fits really well it's super
form-fitting and it just looks really
flattering on the body it next up is
this bodysuit it's this black bodysuit
and I also have it in another color
which you'll see that I love it it's
just a plain black can't tighten this
which is the only downfall
I love the bodysuit anyway it's so
flattering and form-fitting and yes next
I have the exact same bodysuit in this
amazing sky periwinkle baby blueish
color so it was my all-time favorite
color for those who doesn't know that
but it's the same thing just in blue I
think it is so flattering and so perfect
for the summertime
another bodysuit I really loaded up on
bodysuit
this one is really different than I've
never
anything like it so I was really
interested it just is a black bodysuit
with short sleeve and it ties in the
front like around under your boobs and
it's just really flattering on so I
loved seeing it on the model and then I
had to add it or what else do it
xx anything else enough next is this
really cute skirt you guys know I'm not
a huge color girl but when I saw this I
thought I need it because it's just this
amazing red orange color it's so bright
and so fun and I think it would look so
cute over it like a black triangle
bathing suit top just the skirt and the
bathing suit so this next piece is my
comfy way this is something I think I'd
wear more around my house when I'm just
having a lounge day it's a little like
play suit jumpsuit kind of thing you'll
see in the trial but it's actually
shorts and then it just has like these
really nice long sleeves it's kind of
warm so I couldn't wear it right now
outside of my house just because it's
been so hot in LA but I really think
it's just kind of like this q oversized
comfy little jumpsuit that I would
probably just walk around my house in so
next step is this little black with a
pink top this little black shirt I think
this is so pretty and flattering on and
the little details on the side of the
sleeve and the bottom of the shirt I
think are just something to make it a
little bit extra I guess I got the same
shirt in this kind of like mustard
yellow I didn't know how I felt about
this color until it came and it's just
so cute I think this would look great
with vintage Levi's you know like the
high-waisted ones but everyone basically
wears I think this would look really
cute with it and just like really old
school so so next is this little gray
tank top I thought this would look
really cute tied up that's how the model
had it and it just was like a pretty bra
wet underneath because the tank-top
sleeve sleeveless but this part of it is
so open and wide that just a really nice
pro-level look awesome next up is one of
my fave tops at the moment it's just
this long-sleeve white crop you guys
might have seen me in this on snapchat
or something I wear it all the time but
it's just this really cool white crop
top one side says
your dress and the other side says
overeducated which is cool on the
sleeves and it's just like this basic
t-shirt but it looks really good on
everyone he needs a plain white tee in
their life and I'm not talking about the
band what I saw around what happen to
them this is the softest lips off the
shirt ever and I would recommend this
plain white t-shirt to anyone because
everyone needs just a simple basic plain
white - you can get these at Target I'm
sure anywhere near you if you're not
trying to order online but this one is
definitely special because it's so super
soft and it just feels really really
nice next this shirt is a little bit
more grungy not super my style because
it is a little bit more tomboy but I
still like it
it's just this ripped t-shirt I think in
the trial I tied it up I kind of hold
these pieces so long ago I don't even
remember but I think I tied it up and
honestly I might not hide up because I
feel like when I tie up shirts I make my
figure look a little bit boxy er but I
guess it totally depends on the person I
have another like bandish kind of
t-shirt again not super my style um it's
kind of like too edgy for me but I like
it so cute and all I might I like these
types of ban tees if they're like
cropped a lot so I could wear them with
like vintage Levi's the redone jeans or
whatever so I might just cut it okay so
next up I have this big oversized denim
jacket with these little stars all over
them on the mask I think this is super
cute it comes with matching pants but I
guess I forgot to get the pants so I
might go on principale and order its
pants because I thought this would be a
really cute outfit it's a matching it
has like matching denim star pants with
like that light pink singlet I was
talking about I think it look real cute
so that's that
so this dress I got in two colors and I
absolutely love it I like the other one
a little bit more I got all the pieces
in a size 6 by the way this dress just
looks like this but I love most it has
this nice little tire you can tie on the
waist the straps tighten which is also
clutch I also bought it in a green color
which is my favorite I think that this
just looks so nice and the straps also
tighten this one fits a lot better some
reason the blue is kind of powder
makes me like it's a little bit tighter
I got the same size but it just feels
like I'm suffocating more in that one
and this one is just the perfect dress
again it ties it's beautiful I wear it
literally every day I'm obsessed these
talks are so in right now and I wanted
to branch out and get a fun color it's
just this tie top the only thing is this
has major cleavage but if you got it
slotter it right ladies I'm shooting I
got the exact same shirt in just a
checkered pattern I think this one fits
a little bit better it's not as like
exposed in the chest area and it just
feels like it's not going to fall off me
as easily but if you wear a cute bra lab
with orange one you really have nothing
to worry about so I was really excited
about this dress and then when I tried
it on I think it might be a tiny bit too
small maybe if you have a little bit of
a larger chest and you're usually in a
size 6 I would go up to a size 8 just
because there's not a lot of room and it
kind of feels like your boob is about to
pop out but it's still like the cutest
summer dress and I'm probably going to
wear it anyway because I love it you'll
see in the Tryon I think this is just
amazing and it looks like so many nice
brand I have this dress and I absolutely
love this it's just a high-low dress and
it buttons up for this dress I would
definitely recommend again I'm not going
to talk about like boobs the whole
entire video but it just helpful for
those of you that do have a bigger chest
to size up in this dress if you're
normally size 6 the 6 when I used I used
of the 6 and then I got the 8 it's
because when I was buttoning up the 6
the button popped because it didn't fit
around the chest area so I just sliced
up but it fits perfectly this is in a
size 8 and I love it so next this jacket
I think is amazing and it looks so
high-end it kind of looks like that
company euro if you've ever heard of
that and it's just with like light blue
color and it's amazing so I also got a
few pants from a princess Polly starting
with these boyfriend jeans they're just
high waist not within jeans mom jeans
they just had wasted mom jeans
they're completely plain and just cussed
at the ankle the back is also completely
plain I love these because you can style
them any way they're just so easy and
they fit
amazing these next pants are so fun I
got them in a size 6 which is the
smallest size but they are a little bit
too big stuff I'm definitely going to
have to get them taken in so just keep
that in mind if you want to order these
or maybe if you're usually size 8 go to
a size 6 since they run big but these
are awesome they just flare out at the
blog and you'll kind of see in the Tryon
but I love these they're just like black
slacks and they're really dope these
pants are also a little bit big but
they're so fun they're just used light
washed denim pants but they're special
because this ankle flare is huge you'll
see on the Tryon once again the back
just says seven wonders and again I got
this in a smaller size which is a 6
because Australian sizing I guess that's
the smallest but I really do like it
it's super cute I don't know how I would
wear this so please let me know how you
would wear this I might wear this with
either a crop top or a bodysuit
but who knows vastly from prints with
poly I got this little tank top sweater
thing it's this amazing malt color which
is one of my favorite colors for nails
for clothing for basically anything and
I just thought the material was kind of
interesting like perfect for an LA
winter like a sweater tank top accessory
wise from Christmas Holly I got these
and kee Australia times like Debbie
Perkins sunglasses this is quite this
someone's calling me love them they're
so big and like diva I also got these
glasses I don't know if they're a collab
with anyone
Oh times Jasmine Sanders and they look
like this I love these they're just like
so diva I'm obsessed I love big glasses
oh I also got two pairs of shoes I'm
just going to insert the child so the
first are these amazing Doc Martin just
all black and I really like them so
insert clip this is what they look like
the next show it got were these amazing
timberlands I think these are just
really fun kind of weird funky boots
so yeah they're just like this new color
in the cow with a construction boots but
I'm into them now moving on to rock
formation really quickly I only have
three things that store is expensive so
you have to be very very very cautious
with what you're choosing and hoping
Fitzhugh actually there's a store in LA
that I went to and their stores amazing
so if you live in LA ICS you recommend
going to the new store on Melrose is
awesome and so first from information
are the beach pants
I love these I'm going to the lake house
with my boyfriend's family again this
summer so I think these are going to be
perfect for a lake
so just so beachy and summery and fun
I'm also going to another lake house
with my family this summer so this would
also be perfect for that this wrap top I
absolutely love and you're going to see
in the Tryon since it's a little bit
hard to explain but it's just this
really great peachy color a beautiful
color it just ties around your waist
kind of the straps are adjustable and
it's just the perfect summer top lastly
this dress is my obsession it is this
amazing
I actually saw shadow to Sierra and I
saw her wearing this at VidCon and I
thought it was gorgeous on her so I had
to have it
yeah that sounds creepy but I love you
and you looks gorgeous it's just this
really really pretty dress and it has a
tie around it and you'll see in the try
on it is a little big for us to get it
taken in just here so it fits a little
bit better up top but oh my god it's
just like the most amazing pattern so
lastly I'm going to finish off of this
haul with two pairs of jeans from
rag-and-bone actually got them on
Nordstrom Rack on sale though so quite
the steal the first pair is just this
light washed denim jean a completely
plain and it just flares out the tiniest
bit at the ankle like so minimal though
I just think they fit really well and
they're very flattering so I had to have
these when I saw they were on sale and I
also have these strike ones I can see
homes are just crazy and fun I hope them
to the size 25 which is my normal jean
size and for some reason they're a tiny
bit big or a tiny bit small so I don't
know I'm just going to have to figure
out how to stretch them out but they're
so cute
maybe it's just cruising all hi-rise and
I'm used to high-rise and since they
ride on my hip that I don't like it as
much but I still think they're really
cute and fun as hell so
