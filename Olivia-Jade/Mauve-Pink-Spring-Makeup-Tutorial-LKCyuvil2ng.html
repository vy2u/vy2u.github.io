my channel today I've created this make
a book for you guys I thought it was
appropriate for the springtime because
it has a lot of the Mavi pinks and
that's kind of what I think of when I
think of spring and it's just very
shimmery and fun and your skin is super
glowy and then you finish her off with
like a mauve pink lip which I love so if
you guys do want to see yeah and this
looks good just keep watching I'm gonna
finish my sentence I was like choking on
spit so first step is primer I'm using
the Smashbox photo finish primer in
light and I'm just stopping this all
over my face this is going to ensure our
foundation lasts longer and it will also
make the foundation go on so what much
smoother and it looks amazing and then
I'm using the foundation obviously and
i'm using the loreal true match in
natural buff and i'm just blending this
in with a real techniques sponge this is
a dupe of a Beauty Blender I prefer this
though just because it gives a more
natural look in my opinion I like to
dampen this before I use it and then I
use my Maybelline fit me concealer in
the shade 20 and I'm just putting this
in triangles underneath our eyes which
is gonna conceal and then it's also
gonna highlight for us so just your
under eyes are a little more awake and
you just look like you got a little life
in you and then I'm going to use my
honest Razia contour kit and I'm using
that middle banana shade with a setting
brush from where's the start in BH
Cosmetics I think and yeah you guys can
just take any setting powder you like
I'm using a yellow one to cover up our
bags and redness just because yellow
cancels out red and I'm also setting
this with wait no I'm setting my eyelids
I can't talk and then I'm using my Real
Techniques contour brush because why not
contour fake it till you make it
give yourself some fake cheekbones why
not I'm using the third brown shade and
then just putting that from my ear to
under my cheekbone area ish
I don't know and I'm just contouring and
give yourself a little extra shadow
there and then I'm blending that in with
a big blender brush and then I'm using
my Bobbi Brown blush in a nude pink and
then putting this on the apples of my
cheeks all the way up to my cheekbones
so you know you look like you got some
life in you yellow rosy I'm using a fan
brush with my elfs blush in garlic glow
I put
too much on this is so pigmented so then
i buttoned out with my finger and then i
blended out with a brush but on the
other side i got it just with a fan
brush you just got to use a really light
hand and then after you done with that
I'm using my Stila stay all day liquid
eyeprimer and then basically as you can
see just putting that all over my
eyelids and then I'll bring it a little
bit closer to do my eye look I'm taking
a blender brush and I'm using this NYX
shadow and I will have it linked down
below if I can find it again and I'm
just blending out into the crease I use
this in my or I use this product know I
showed this product in my March
favourites and as you can see I'm just
blending it out in the crease it's so
beautiful and then I'm using this light
pink shimmer color from the Stila stay
all day palette in the shade kitten
which just kind of highlights your eyes
a little bit gives some shimmer on your
eyelids it looks really nice and then
just taking the same blending brush with
barely any shadow on it and just going
in and blending all of that out and then
taking the shade bubbly from the Stila
stay all day palette and I'm just
putting that on the outer third of my
eye and taking the same blending brush
with no shadows on it and just blending
it out the whole thing is just blend
blend blend blend blend and then it will
look smoky and nice I'm then using my
eyeliner from BH Cosmetics it's just a
liquid eyeliner and doing just a fairly
thin line and then I'm using the miss
manga I think that's what it's called
mascara I don't know the Tasha told me
to get it but Tosh I'm not the biggest
fan I think I just got it use it more
and then I'm using some lip liner and
lipstick so that's it for making
tutorial I hope you guys all enjoyed let
me know down below what you guys spot
and if you have any other video requests

I will try my best to do this so thank
