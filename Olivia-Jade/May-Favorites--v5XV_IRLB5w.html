today I'm filming my may favorites video
which I am so so excited about because I
have so many amazing things to share
with you guys for the month of May that
I've just been loving I do have a lot of
beauty products that's mostly what this
video is but I also have a few random
things like some songs movies bla bla
bla bla bla so without further ado let's
jump right into the video and you guys
all enjoy and let me know down below
what you guys think I was just in New
York so I was watching movies on the
airplane ride over and I am obsessed
with think like a man and think like a
man too
they are both there's two of movies and
they're both amazing they're so funny
and they're a little bit I guess for a
more mature audience so if you are so a
little bit young maybe you don't watch
them yet just because just because your
mom will hate me even though I'm young
too but I'm 15 and I thought it was
really good so so my next favorite is a
website but to actually package to show
you it's from cent bird set bird is a
perfume sampling subscription box that
is so hard to say for me I don't know
why that sends you stuff once a month
and basically you take a survey so they
kind of understand what you like and
what your taste in perfumes are so they
can send you one that you would
obviously like they send you little
perfumes that come in sent for packaging
but it's like gotten two percent
authentic the real perfume I got product
handy oh it smells amazing
a Maybelline Color tattoo in the shade
back to the bronze I believe yeah 25
back to the bronze
I have this on my eyelid right now and
blended into my crease it's the only
shadow I'm wearing on my lid right now I
had this little product in my drawer for
quite some time because it meant to get
barely branded but then I messed up and
got back to the bronze and said I don't
know how those don't really look the
same they just start with these and the
colors are so different but it's fine
now I really like it anyway
next I'm starting out with what's on my
face and it's the it cosmetics CC
cream and it has an SPF of 50 plus which
is amazing so here's the thing with this
this I use this with my kabuki brush
from Sigma and it is what a duo let me
tell you I am obsessed when I buy a
warning foundation or anything they
blend it out and make it look as natural
as possible but there always is that
kind of effect where you know your right
makeup it looks like your Rainmaker
it doesn't look dewy and amazing I mean
some foundations do but it doesn't blend
perfectly into your skin and just settle
super well foundations always look kind
of like somehow like you can just kind
of see on your cheeks a little bit or
something even if I blend it out it
always happens to me I can't speak on
your guys and half maybe foundations
always look amazing on you but um this
it cosmetics CC cream has just as much
cover as a foundation and it's even more
buildable than a foundation in my
opinion so I just packed it on like the
couple layers and it looks so natural
like it looks like my skin and it's so
dewy and so fresh I I don't know how
they did that I just like blending it
out with this big kabuki brush as I was
talking about a little bit earlier I
don't know why I just smile next I have
been loving this lights cameras splashes
mascara it's waterproof and I talked
about this on my channel I think a while
back but I don't remember it's an
amazing mascara the formula is super wet
so what kind of some years but it's gel
I still like it anyway I don't have much
to say it just makes your lashes super
thick and black and long and it
separates them it doesn't leave them
clumpy which is something I really like
for another mascara this is my benefit
roller lash and it's amazing you have
word this is hands down one of the best
mascaras I've ever used because once
again it doesn't give that clumpy look
it's very separated and long and thick
though and it's amazing
I don't have that like that little thing
I just said was so passionate but I love
it because it's so makes your lashes so
long and so thick next um especially for
the summer
this has just come in handy for me I
just ordered this off of Amazon and
their tantowels and these are something
that are so easy to apply because I'm
naturally darker have a very olive kind
of undertone Tan and this gives you kind
of an orange undertone they're not
orange so not like girls should have
faked him but just like a really nice
natural looking tan it makes you darker
so basically they come in little
packages like this and a huge box
remember get our self-tan towelettes
it's a half body application for face
and body so you can put these on your
face I haven't tried it yet so I don't
know if it breaks you out but you just I
just like to do this right before I go
to sleep so I apply this just all over
my body after I get off the shower and I
don't use moisturizer so it suggests you
apply this two to three times a week and
it lasts for about a week and a half and
if you want a deeper tan you just apply
it four hours later then you already
applied it I would just probably do it
the next night but listen to the back of
the directions because they know what's
up another little product I've been
loving is my Beauty Blender this is an
oldie but a goodie obviously and I've
just been using it once again it looks
disgustingly dirty right now but it's
actually not I just washed it it blends
out foundation and everything so well
but recently I've been loving it for
creme bronzers or cream contours and it
just blends out so nicely so I'm a big
fan of this of course another favorite
that I've been loving is my madam glam
fruit punch
classic matte lipstick which I have on
my lips right now and it is the most
amazing color as you can see I'm doing a
whole swatch video on all 12 or all 10
up or down right there of the matte
lipstick collection so look out for this
because all the colors are amazing and I
really want to show you guys that so i
swatched all of them
it will be in an upcoming video but oh I
love them the same whip this is though I
use this the first time without
exploiting my lips true moisturizing and
I hated it it was so dry and I just I
really really really didn't like it
I now exfoliate and moisturize before I
put this on and it goes on so creamy and
then obviously it's matte now so you're
gonna need to moisturize at least I just
put a little chapstick on and then apply
it so it goes on so much creamier and
lastly for my favorites I have been
loving this Sigma palette and it is
beautiful I've been just playing around
with some of the colors in here and I'm
so excited to do a tutorial on it so if
you guys do want a tutorial with this
palette then just let me know by giving
this video a thumbs up because damn look
at these colors like that bright pink oh
so badly want to play around with that
I've been playing around with kind of
the more neutral colors like the bronze
the tan I want to do some fun fun video
with it like incorporating this hot pink
there cuz I think that would be really
cool so yeah thank you guys all so much
for watching my may favorites I hope you
all enjoyed and I'll see you guys next
time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
