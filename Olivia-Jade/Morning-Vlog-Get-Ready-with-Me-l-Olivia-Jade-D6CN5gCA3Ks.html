my channel I just got out of the showers
you can obviously tell I feel so much
better and just like more alive and
awake but today I just thought I would
do a little vlog for Saturday's video
little get ready with me I'm gonna do my
makeup to my hair so the first thing I
do is moisturize my skin obviously in
the daytime I use this amazing hydro
care remarkable soothing lotion and I
really like it I do a little bit of eye
cream this is the Kiehl's one you guys
I've been obsessed with this I'll link
all these makeup products and skincare
products I use three boys cuz you need
this in your life see it like
automatically brings a little bit
brightness I do a little bit of primer
so whatever makeup I put on just looks
pretty on my face I want you to comment
down below what your doing tonight what
your plan is I really don't want to wear
any tinted moisturizer today but I feel
like since I'm not matching I kind of
have to write I haven't used these in a
hot second through the gloss no their
milk makeup sunshine skin tints farmer's
day what I normally use is really light
as well but I feel like this is a little
bit lighter in shade and not unlike
coverage so it might be a better match
yeah and I'm just gonna blend it out a
little bit
but is gorgeous oh my god and then I
just take my sponge make sure it's like
damp but make sure there's no water
because I don't kind of take it off I've
been accidentally wanting it too much
lazy and then I'm just gonna kind of Pat
over everything
wow that's looks really pretty now like
a tiny tiny amount of concealer
lend it out just with the blender coz my
finger let's doing the job so hot in
here
I was end up having to do this with my
bathroom just make us look like my skin
I'm gonna love this little bit peek
through I'm using my Laura Mercier
translucent powder
whoo I don't want to do bronzer or
contour the powder or anything like that
today oh you know what I really want to
try out though okay I'm gonna try out
this milk blush in the shade Rowley
apparently this just makes your cheeks
look insane so I'll be the judge of that
oh my god that is stunning I'm just
gonna take a little bit of mascara and
put it on
laughs I'm going to use this bite lip
mask it's the agave lip mask so
apparently this stuff is amazing I got
cha hydrating stuff is so nice it feels
like you're wearing a really nice like
hydrating mask but it gives color that's
cool okay so I'm gonna be carrying
around this and my prayer oh no this is
the wrong shade no this one's in
champagne I feel like this is starts
with an S it's just the red one I think
they only have with three shades like
champagne natural on the end this one
but recommend this is gorgeous I was
wearing the champagne one yesterday and
it's also super pretty but now let's
pick out an outfit have a tickle in my
throat okay so I'm gonna check the
weather right now in LA so then I can
decide what I want to wear it is 62 and
cloudy so it's a little bit cold out so
I'm not cold just like on the breezy
breezy side so I'm gonna wear something
I wanted to wear a dress but it is 62
degrees and cloudy so that might look
weird
I guess I'll wear jeans okay my post
mate just got here I post made it a
bunch of wellness shots from creation
you guys know if you watch my vlogs I
take them quite often I kind of swear by
them and since I'm traveling I well I
don't do them that often because I don't
want my body to get used to them but I
try and take them Sam I often so like
when I'm traveling stuff because I leave
for New York again next week and I just
got back traveling and it's just been
like kind of crazy and I'm going out
