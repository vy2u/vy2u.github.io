to another video in today's video I am
doing my everyday makeup this is so
requested you guys have been asking what
I've been doing for the winter time how
I keep my skin glowy all these crazy
things that y'all want to know and so
I'm here to sit down and film it for you
a step by step super easy I don't wear
foundation and I still feel like I get a
very nice even full coverage kind of
look so if you guys want to see how I do
this make sure to hit the subscribe
button turn on my little post
notifications and yeah let's get started
okay so the first thing I start with is
this primer it's the Mac strobe cream
hydrating primer this is in the shade
gold light and I don't put this all over
my face because it is so glowy and
gorgeous I just put it in two spots
I really want to highlight and bring
light to so I'll just put a little my
hand my finger and I just kind of apply
it to my cheeks
just like so I brought you guys in a
little bit closer so you could see what
I'm doing the first thing I always start
with is a tinted moisturizer I do not
use foundation
I actually don't wear makeup every
single day but this is like my weekend
go to look and I'm gonna wear makeup so
this tinted moisturizer is my favorite
it's a Laura Mercier oil-free and I use
the shade tawny for when I'm tan
I found a trick that I absolutely love
doing so I'm gonna show you okay so I am
taking the morphe 7 brush you can use
any flat top kabuki though they all
worked pretty much the same and this is
how I applied my tinted moisturizer it's
still super natural and light coverage
which I love but I think this just makes
it look so even and just gorgeous and a
little bit more full coverage for a
tinted moisturizer if you guys like full
coverage you're not gonna want to use a
thin moisturizer like this but for me I
love it and it has SPF in it which is
amazing so I just take it on my cheeks
and apply it and I literally just blend
it out like this
make sure you take it down your neck
it's key also it happens shake a little
bit more
so after that I'm going to take my NARS
radiant creamy concealer I have been
going between this and the tarte
concealer for like the longest time
right now I'm really into this one
sometimes I feel like it looks so good
to glow and then other times I'm like my
eyes look really dry so it just depends
if I'm taking really good care of my
under eyes with eye creams and serums
and all that kind of stuff so I just
take this and I kind of go a little bit
crazy with it but I like it because it's
not thick so you can go crazy and it
doesn't look cakey so I just drag it
like so I also do the other side make
sure punished and then I just do it
where I've like any extra redness or
anything I want to cover up I don't you
probably think you like okay you're
crazy you use way too much but it looks
normal and because I don't wear
foundation so I like having a little bit
of coverage I take I adapt Beauty
Blender and then I just blend this all
in
okay so after I blend out my concealer I
look pretty even I feel like for the
most part I still have a little blemish
right there and you guys this one has
been here for days and she will not
leave and it's really hard to cover but
I am just gonna cover a little bit of it
and then what I like to do if I ever
have a blemish like this that will
literally will not go away is I take
like a little concealer brush or like a
little flat shader brush this would work
really well too
if I look more people have this type of
brush I'll show you with this one and I
just go around the blemish I don't ever
like touch the actual owner so I just
blend out around it does that make sense
so the coverage still stays directly on
it so that's as good as it's gonna get
for that because she's struggling I'm
just gonna blend out the concealer under
my eyes and then set it with powder
right away this is the one thing that
hasn't changed my Laura Mercier powder I
use it all the time and I love it
I like applying my powder with a little
tapered brush this one's by BH Cosmetics
they have the best affordable sets on BH
Cosmetics for brushes I also love
morphine okay I'm just gonna set
directly into my eyes
I don't bake on everyday term like if
I'm going out to an event and I'm doing
my own makeup then I'll bake but every
day I just dust a little under my eyes
and then in my t-zone and then I just
quite like take it all over then make
sure you hit that spot where you covered
up
okay so and now I'm going to move on to
my eyebrows this is the benefit goof
proof brow pencil and I use the shade
number four it has been my spoolie and
then it has like this little old pencil
you could say so what I do first is I
just brush up my eyebrows as you can
tell I kind of have thick ish brows
already so I don't go too crazy I
definitely use a really light hand I
don't know where my little stand-up
mirror went so I'm using this one
basically what I do is I just kind of
carve out the natural shape fill in
where it's sparse and then basically
just continue filling it in until I'm
happy with how it looks
okay so after I am done filming love it
I've been done filming I'm gonna take my
makeup off and get him a bit and watch
TV so after I am done with my eyebrows I
use my honest Asya clear brow gel and I
just brush through my brows you don't
want to work super hard and then have
them move so that's what I do my brows
can you believe it we're almost done so
bronzer of course I use this Laura
Mercier candle glowed sheer perfecting
powder I just use it in a dark shade so
I can bronze with it it's in the shade
number six and I usually just take like
a fluffy brush I really like this morphe
M 5 to 7 and I just like go along my
cheekbones I don't really contour I just
like love looking tan so I just warm up
my face
and then after I'm done with that I go
in with this two-faced sweetie pie
radiant matte bronzer I know another
bronzer but it kind of has like some
glow to it so I just take this I'm like
a smaller brush and I literally just
like apply it just to the cheeks just
like super light gives like a nice
little glow oh my god it smells amazing
then for a little bit of highlight I use
this Oprah highlighter in the shade
Rodeo Drive my home town so I take a
little bit of this highlighter on I'm
gonna brush this it's super pigmented
like super see that like wow so I just
kind of apply to the top of my cheekbone
I sometimes put it on the apples of my
cheek but since I have is it right there
I don't want to highlight visit so I'm
just gonna kind of skip it up all right
Oprah chill people talking and I don't
want to be rude and didn't kill to be
quiet but it kinda want to be rude and
say you looking into what isn't this so
pretty and then I just do it on the tip
of my nose but I like lifting my nose up
a little bit so I just put it a little
bit higher than the actual tip
I think a nose button nose highlights so
keep my night shake my view Bunder and
then it out a little bit almost done I
promise
okay now for eyes really all I do is
take a little bit of like a cream gel
brownish color eyeliner this is color
pop super affordable what I do with this
is I just line my waterline and then I
also take like an angled brush something
like this and I just take like a matte
black shade and I literally just lined
the tops this just makes your mascara
look a lot better and thicker and your
eyelashes with Chloe rivers and it's
super quick and I don't come all the way
in I just kind of do like the outer half
another product that hasn't changed but
you guys know I'm obsessive it is my Too
Faced better than sex mascara I swear by
this mascara and I just coat my upper
lashes I don't do my lower lashes during
the daytime because then it can transfer
under my eyes when I'm out running
errands and I hate that more than
anything having like black dots under my
eyes where my concealer supposed to be
so I literally just do the top lashes
and what I do with the top lashes is
very strategically I go as deep in the
root that I can get it like so far in
and then I wiggle it out you'll see and
if you get a little bit around it's
totally fine just let it dry for like 30
seconds and then you can easily wipe it
away sometimes I do about two coats of
this so let's do the other eye I'm going
to also just take it towards the end and
kind of focus it towards the outer
lashes so it's like a cat eye effect
you might be thinking Olivier you should
be a little bit more careful I think
that every morning - but when you're in
a rush sometimes you just like throw it
on and it's totally cool just let it dry
for like 30 seconds and then you can
wipe it off super easily okay so what
I'm gonna do is just take like glitter
the any brush and just like brush away
where the black is see the q-tip that's
ideal in my youtube room so I don't have
a q-tip on me taking a clean brush but
this works tada
almost everything and then just to
finish off I use my colour-pop lippie
stix in the shade drop top and this is
just like a nice little cream and I
don't go crazy I just kind of like do a
little bit of color and then finish off
the whole look I'm obsessed with my
Urban Decay all nighter makeup setting
spray for long-lasting oil-free one
shake it up
