no it's really not that early I have
free eyes my first period so I got to
sleep in a little bit a lot of people
always really confused with my school
schedule um cuz I'm home all the time
it's just cuz I'm a senior so I have
free period so when I have reads I like
to come home and work on YouTube and
stuff because obviously it's hard to
balance being a student and working but
it's really fun and today I wanted to
use my free period to film my morning
routine and I actually woke up a little
bit before my alarm so yeah this what I
look like in the morning I just did like
a vlog style night routine and a lot of
those comments were like please do a
morning routine version so that's what
I'm gonna do and the day you watch this
is the day I'm actually filming it
because I want it to be like super
authentic I don't know I just think it's
fun to watch it in like present time I
also really want to do more outfit
videos I start travelling in this next
week so I'm gonna be filming a lot of
vlogs so please comment down below other
videos you want to see besides vlogs
because you're gonna be getting a lot of
those and I don't want you guys to get
sick of them but yeah so first thing I
do in the morning is sleep a little bit
more and then I go on my phone and go
through Instagram and Twitter and
I don't want to wake up I don't want to
go to school
I hate school but but um it's so not
fair for me to say my school is super
chill and cool and nice to me about
working and they're super supportive
with my job and stuff I like my school I
just don't like school and general you
feel me I have a math test right when I
get to school and I don't know anything
on it I'm like very confused on how to
do basically everything so that should
be fun
wish me luck I should probably get up
now my hair is okay let's get up kiddos
I'm gonna put slippers on to my ankles
from crack Dressel yeah oh this is a new
outfit I just got I'm going to Fashion
Week and I'm styling myself I'm not
gonna wear these this I think I'm gonna
wear another time yes I'm signing myself
I feel like that's a part of me what I
do first things first
brushing my teeth obviously that's
pretty impressive my gosh don't pop be
you why I don't like this
the last thing I do is a little bit I
cream this is from Kiehl's and I've been
really liking it so I just put a little
bit of that on I think you're just kind
of like bright and dry and it's like so
good like if you have dry under eyes and
your concealers creasing and stuff try
this stuff out it's really good
we're not creasing drying up sorry it's
early all right let's get dressed
hi guys so obviously I didn't want to
change on camera but the next thing I do
is apply something to my lips usually in
the morning I go for this Terry Baume De
Rose lip hydrating it bang this is very
casual yay okay so I don't wear makeup
to school I never have probably never
will I just don't care enough to try
hard because I'm a senior and I'm over
it and I'm done I used to wear makeup
saves a lot of time in the morning I'll
probably put a little makeup on right
now just because I'm filming and I can't
stand to look at this no makeup face
anymore and you guys probably can't
stand it either at this point so I'll
probably put like a little concealer and
some mascara and call it a day okay
gonna take a little bit of NARS put it
right there right there and right there
alright and then I'm gonna be it super
lazy also my hair is just really fun
okay and then I'm just gonna go like
this
with my finger this gives you like the
very natural look if you're into that
like I am if I did wear makeup to school
this is probably what I would do okay
and then after I just kind of want Matt
out and just set it with a little bit of
powder
and then maybe some mascara my camera
just died but luckily I had another
battery I'm gonna show you guys the
mascara I've been using lately
it's the you Balme mascara by milk
makeup and the way I do it is it has
like as you can see this applicator that
has like three different sections so
what I like to do I like individually
coat each eyelash and it just makes them
really long I don't know it's what I do
when I'm going out I'm not even getting
it in the shot I'm such a good youtuber
go down here
excuse my hunchback don't ever sit like
this you will get on your back why are
my neighbors being around it's like
literally 8 a.m. that's really all I'm
gonna do maybe I should put broad brow
gel cuz my brows look crazy see this is
what happens to me I don't do makeup and
I start and I like it so much that I
keep going this is why I just don't do
it ever I'm gonna over my brow gel is
I'm honestly a little too lazy to look
for it I like a spoolie at least gonna
go like this and then I'm gonna take a
little bit like please
okay guys taught me guys oh my god I
need a saw I can't stop I'm addicted
okay we're done we're done
okay back to my outfit leggings socks
red sweatshirt with spirit we got my
school right now my senior color is red
so that's why I'm in a red sweatshirt if
you're wondering me to wipe away this
mascara the hoods under my eye a little
bit cool lovely we're done let's go put
shoes on what shoes what shoes what
shoes
I usually opt for something that is easy
to put on like the first things I see my
vans all right I'm gonna put these on
okay so breakfast time I'm going to make
two eggs I'll put your marriage
two eggs wellness shots and an avocado
just what feels right all right let's do
this
let's too lazy to get a bowl so I just
kind of crack the egg to the band
made breakfast it's not the prettiest
thing but it really is yummy and filling
and it's just a little taco all right
I'm gonna eat this just finish my
breakfast it was really good ate it
really bad
how would you fast but I'm gonna take
this wellness shot right now
it's antibiotic I'm traveling a lot so I
want to make sure I'm super healthy when
I'm on the plane and everything this
next week so this is the antibiotic shot
it has lemon garlic ginger alkaline
water oregano oil I hate that stuff and
Himalayan salt this is disgusting I'll
probably throw up when I take it though
enjoy so much kidding I'm gonna actually
throw up if I do I'll have a throw up
warning I'll be guide I mean I just fell
some water up I'm so bad at taking these
every time I take them I spill on myself
so I'm gonna go like this because I get
grossed out and then I just spill on my
shirt that's sexy
welcome to my eating show I'm around it
smells horrible I had my water I shot
these are from creation if you have a
creation by you you should really cut
these if you ever feel sick they knock
it right out here I'm not kidding okay
but it's bill on the bright time I'm
I've tried out to breathe out of my nose
because then I'll taste this so enjoy
this really cute boys mind all right we
did it
see MD I'm also just gonna take these
cuz they taste good I don't even know if
they do anything I just really like the
taste of them but I don't get the taste
out of my mouth
basically that's really it for my
morning routine nothing else really
happens except I go to school and I
struggle and I persevere and then I come
back if a dance class later today I have
an event later tonight which I'm gonna
vlog because it's a Victoria Secret
event they have so I'm gonna do that
