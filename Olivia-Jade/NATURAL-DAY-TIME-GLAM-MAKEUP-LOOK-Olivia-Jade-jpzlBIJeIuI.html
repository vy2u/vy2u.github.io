the last but not least set beautiful
black is c60 for so I'm just going to
kind of show you the amazing range they
have are they not gorgeous and they're
so creamy and amazing and the matte ones
are even creamy I'm obsessed
okay now helping in the tutorial the
first thing I'm going to do is prime my
skin for makeup and then move straight
onto the eyes I already concealed so I'm
just setting that with a powder all
product will be linked down below for
usual so you guys know what I used if
anything catches your eye but I'm first
using my morphe palette as I said the
number and the names will be down below
and I'm just kind of taking a brown
shade and running that through my crease
this is just to give a little bit more
dimension and depth and yeah just to
create a smoky base and I zoomed in a
little bit closer so you could see what
I was doing I have a lot of freckles as
you can see so then I'm taking a darker
shade and I'm blending that a little bit
below the crease just to create a
smokier look and to give it more depth
and dimension and I'm taking a pencil
brush and the two shades I put my crease
I mix those together and I'm blending
that on my lower lash line and then I'm
also kind of taking it on my inner like
crease I don't know how to describe it
and I'm taking a really shimmery light
pink and just applying that with my
middle finger to my eyelid because I
think it just gives a really nice pop of
color and I think it just kind of
completes the look I love going with
matte in the crease and then a nice
light light shimmer on the lid and then
I'm just taking my brush with no extra
product on it and blending that out and
then I'm taking my makeup forever smoky
mascara this is my favorite and I just
happen to use an action in this video so
I'm just applying that to my top and
bottom lashes as you can tell I'm not
using falsies because this mascara does
wonders and then I'm taking the Make Up
For Ever HD foundation I didn't actually
need to use this much makeup forever
even though my lips are all I meant to
do the lips but not actually the face I
guess I'm just obsessed I am blending
this out with a Beauty Blender and I
just sped through this you guys have
seen this thousands of time on my
channel you guys know what the drill is
but I'm just blending this out I love
this foundation it gives such full
coverage and then I'm also taking a
really light concealer from the Anasazi
a contour kit and I'm just blending that
out
under my eyes to highlight and brighten
because sense are kind of going with a
bold lip and since we also are going
with kind of a smoky look that you know
I think it's important to clean up
everywhere else and just make your skin
look really really flawless with a
little bright concealer and I'm just
bringing out on all the places that I
would normally highlight you guys know I
don't even have to tell you and then
beside that I'm just blending that out
with a Beauty Blender the same old drill
and then I'm also setting it with a
little bit of powder just to keep it in
place I feel like I don't even need to
explain as you already know um and then
I'm going to contour a little bit with
just a normal brown shade warm up my
whole entire face this is something I do
almost in every video so yeah you guys
know
and then for an intense highlight I'm
using my Bobbi Brown shimmer brick and
I'm just highlighting my cheekbones
because why not um they're they're just
a must so I'm just highlighting the tops
of those and of course highlighting my
Cupid's bow for this beautiful lip shade
you got to get it prepped so the lip
shade is extra poppin but I'm gonna move
on to my eyebrows before I do that cuz
I've forgotten about them and we can't
abandon my crazy uneven eyebrows at all
moments so I'm just taking a pencil
brush nope nope I'm taking the honest
Razia pencil just you know brow wiz and
I'm just filling in my brows I just had
to set them first I have no idea why but
then I'm taking this beautiful shade and
see 1:07 as I said in the beginning and
obviously it's available at Sephora it
is the new artist huge lipstick in C 107
as a set or 107 and the brand is makeup
forever as you know um so this is
amazing you guys know it has a really
smooth texture and you can also choose
between the cream and mattes and this is
the cream is there's a C in front of it
as you know but yeah that's what it
looks like and I'm obsessed and I hope
you love it that is it for my video
thank you so much for watching I love
you guys and I will catch you guys next
time bye MA</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
