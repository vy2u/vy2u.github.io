today I'm going to teach you all about
non touring which is basically not
contouring and a little earlier this
year Kim Kardashian mentioned that this
was kind of the new trend like
contouring zout non Touring's in I want
to say thank you so much to Laura
Mercier for partnering on me with this
video you guys can get all these lovely
products at Sephora com or in stores so
whatever support you have close to you
if you want to run and get anything I
used on my face today you guys totally
can without further ado let's get in the
video about non touring and I hope you
enjoy number one step is priming your
skin I am using my Laura Mercier
foundation primer in radiance this is so
amazing it just gives a lot of glow to
your skin and it is just a huge help
before putting on our tinted moisturizer
I'm going to use today the regular
tinted moisturizer because what you can
do with this is apply it with your
fingertips for such a natural look so
that's we're going to today and I'm
going to show you that it completely
evens out your skin and then I also have
this tinted moisturizer which is the oil
free version and what I love about this
is a lot of people probably don't know
this their oil free teaching moisturizer
you can use it with their Laura Mercier
sponge and it will build up more
coverage so for those of you that have
more problem spots or you feel like you
need more coverage that you can't get
with the regular one try using their
sponge and the oil-free one and I bet
you will see a huge difference you're
welcome
so I am going to use my laura mercier
fan powder brush and the cool thing
about this I know it just looks like an
ordinary powder brush but the actually
the cool thing about it is the black
hairs they are natural so they pick up a
lot more product so if you want a more
intense look you use the black bristles
white hairs are synthetic and that will
give a really light look to your face
and it won't be as pigmented or heavy or
intense of a glow there are four really
amazing shades out of these illuminators
that you guys can choose from I'm going
to show you right now the swatches of
them starting with this really beautiful
light pink shade on my arm right here
this is called devotion and will give
you a really light glow and all these
eliminators actually give a really nice
subtle glow the next shade is called
addiction basically just a nice pure
gold the next shade is called
indiscretion and it's kind of a pinky
gol that's a mix between I would say
devotion and addiction the last shade is
called
seduction and that is just a really nice
warm brown shade we are just going to
use the fan brush and the illuminators
to start highlighting while this gives
you a really awesome glow it's also
bronzing you as you can see you can see
the difference it looks so good Aristide
up so now I can really show you what's
good it just gave a really really pretty
bronzy gold glow to your skin and now
we're going to go with that light a
shade devotion which is like a gorgeous
light pink and we're just going to
highlight the tops of our cheek bone but
once again I showed you the four shades
so you can go in with whatever
illuminator you want whichever
complements your skin tone I just like
devotion online so with devotion I'm
gonna use the tips of my brush and just
feather that oh my god it looks so good
yes please I will have a lot of that oh
honey
mmm see that and guys do you see how
light the amount of product I'm picking
up it was that English I'm like so blown
away
so anyway that is it for my video on non
touring I hope you guys loved it and I
loved the way it turned out
thanks again to laura mercier for
helping me out with this video and i
will get you guys on my next one bye na</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
