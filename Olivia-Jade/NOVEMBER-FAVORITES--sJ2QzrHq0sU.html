filming a November favorites we are
basically in December which is my
favorite part of the year because it's
Christmas and that's literally like my
favorite holiday if you're new to my
channel you probably wouldn't know that
I try and do these videos once a month
and if you're not Nathan welcome back so
let's go ahead and get started I have
quite a lot of favorites and I just want
to kind of get in this video so it's not
so tedious and boring you're better
sitting you're like watching me pull out
a hundred different products so let's
get started and I hope you guys enjoy so
the first thing is a little bit random
is a speaker and it's the bows um I
don't know it's just this huge speaker
and I got it when I got my info because
I got the 6s plus if you're looking for
a good speaker I mean it's definitely
expensive I'm not sure how much it is
but I'll link it down below but um I
think it's expensive but if you're
looking for like a good speaker and you
don't have something that place for your
apartment or your condo or your house or
something like that which is prompt
which is pretty rare that you have
speakers throughout your house that
plays like nice music this is worth
saving up on I love it especially with
all the new albums that are coming out
it's so key next is my favorite sweater
ever which is my blue knit my huge like
blue knit sweater which is the softest
thing from brandy melville it's called
the oli sweater and they have just
released a bunch of new colors in it
there's like light pink army green like
black navy blue like all these colors
they don't have like blue anymore but
they have the most amazing colors and
they're the softest sweaters for makeup
brushes I've been loving a few different
types the first one is my Sedona lace 2
and concealer brush I don't know if this
is actually meant for concealer but I
saw kathleenlights talking about it on
her channel so when she did I bought it
and I'm literally obsessed it's so good
it just kind of like fits right in there
to blend out concealer I love my Sigma
e-40 @e 55 it's like a double-ended
brush and then fluffy side is super good
for blending in your crease and then the
flat side it's just good for packing on
shades I just love it I think because
it's so so easy to just kind of like
carry around with you since it is double
sided enough to break two brushes it's
just two and one and then lastly my Real
Techniques expert face brush which is
just a really dense face brush I love
about blending out foundation with this
because it blends it out beautifully but
also you can get a really full coverage
since the brush is so dense next I've
been loving my Too Faced Arda palette
has the most incredible shades
it has mattes and shimmers but it's just
shades that you would wear every day
except for the shade follow me is this
bright purple which I probably wouldn't
wear everyday but these shades are so
easy to create such fun looks like I
loved playing around this it's very
pigmented it's just yeah super pigmented
like you don't need maxixe plus anything
like that literally just need this
palette if I could recommend one palette
just to have I definitely would
recommend this one or let me get palette
or something something really basic with
mattes and shimmers
like have a lot of pigments before
makeup I've been loving my makeup
forever professional Paris Pro sculpting
duo I kind of forgot about this it's the
double shaded one has a highlight in a
bronzer and what I like to do is just
take a huge blush brush and blend them
together and put on the apples of my
cheeks to give me a really really nice
highlight that's what I'm wearing right
now and I was also wearing this in my
September favorites and a lot of people
seem to like that highlight that I don't
think I've talked about this in favors
before but it's back and better than
ever I've been using it a lot again I've
been loving my NYX wonder stick which is
a highlight and contour stick I think
the highlight is pretty just a light
shade but I really love the contour part
I don't really use the highlight part
this just gives the most amazing kind of
harsh Kardashian esque contour and it's
affordable it's lasted me a very long
time it's easy to draw on and the colors
pretty perfect it's kind of like a
warmish little gray undertone so it
looks like a natural contour but also
you can warm up your face for eye
products I've been loving the Sigma
boost extended wear eyeliner which is
just a black eyeliner a blast oh I just
broke it it's just a really really
really creamy kind of pigmented eyeliner
you don't have to push it after try
really hard I'd love just kind of
putting like
uneven layer on my lash line and then
just smudging out with the brush it gets
the most smoky and it looks so hard to
achieve and it looks like oh she put so
much work into her eye look but it's so
simple well so simple so I love it also
from Sigma the monumental lash this
mascara is it my favorite thing I think
Sigma just released a bunch of mascaras
and I got a bunch of them and there's
three different kinds and I'm in love
with them these are easily the best
mascaras I've ever tried so you have to
get your hands on these if you have the
opportunity and a drugstore do or not do
just a different mascara which I've been
loving is the main link they're not
alike at all but the Maybelline lash
sensational mascara and it just comes in
like pick little rocket tube and it's
just an amazing master egg there's so
much thickness and length and volume so
yeah I'm going to go in to skincare and
oh I want to mention this my Too Faced
not into skin care yet uh next I have my
Too Faced hangover primer which is
coconut water and um yeah it's just with
coconut water and a couple other
ingredients it's open free and it smells
so amazing it's like a vanilla coconut
smell and it's just like rubbing water
on your face it makes your makeup last
so much longer and it's so hydrating if
you have dry skin it's amazing if you
have oily skin it's amazing it's the
best primer I've ever used in my life
and if you have more weight like the
most perfect thing ever so love this
primer makes all the difference I prom
and now for skincare I've been loving
the Murad products so my you're at
essential C toner and you literally
spray it on your all of your
I wish that come here um I start at the
very top I've used this every morning
and night since I've gotten it and I
literally not even close be done it is
the most incredible thing I don't know
what to say about it except you need to
try this I've been after my makeup even
just so it doesn't look it's cakey I
kind of use it like you would mac fix+
spray and it's incredible the Murad
daily cleansing foam which is just a
cleanser and it's foam as it says in the
name crazy I go but you just put on your
handle on it to make mess but it just
comes out as a foam it looks like wood
but it's like a white foam you rub it
all over your face and it just cleanses
really well it makes your skin I've
noticed my skin cleared up a long after
using this and I never had bad acne so
if you're on you have really a times
acne and you're kind of on a program
just stick to your program but if you're
just looking for something new and just
kind of bored of using yourself or
whatever you use and you just want to
change it up a little bit and you're not
afraid to try new skin products then
your ad is so gentle and I love it
that's it for my November favorites I'm
sorry if I kind of sped through this
riff I was talking fast I just wanted to
share what I had and what I loved for
this month and even October without
making this video super super long so
thank you guys so much for watching and
hoping to cut this down to six or seven
minutes but we will see I love you guys
so much and I'll see you guys in my next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
