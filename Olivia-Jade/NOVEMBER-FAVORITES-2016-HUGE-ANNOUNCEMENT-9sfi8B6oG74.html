um yeah I guess let's just get started
into my favorites I hope you love them

excited for me everything oh then
hopefully you are and don't forget
subscribe if you're not subscribed I'm
Olivia
Jane on YouTube if you guys want to see
my November favorites but I've been
loving for the month of November then
just keep watching and I can't wait to
share it with you
so I want to start out with my first
like product favorite that I've been
using like crazy this it's just I have
no words um this is the Mario Badescu of
skincare facial spray with aloe herbs
and rosewater this is literally amazing
it smells it smells like what's in it
just smells like rose water but it's so
refreshing and rejuvenates your skin so
much I always use this before I put my
makeup on before I go to bed right when
I wake up it really just kind of like
wakens you and just makes you feel
really really refreshed that's the only
way I can describe it it makes your skin
feel really hydrated and it smells
incredible and all natural products are
in it obviously it's amazing I just
receive this in my P o box from Sigma
it's the Sigma cig magic brush shampoo
and I've been needing to clean
my brushes for far too long um so I was
like you know what I'll just try this
out it's kind of like perfect timing no
words me because I always clean my
brushes with um soap and just like water
or soap and conditioner um so this just
like works ten times better but
literally you just have to use like this
much and you just swirl your brush
around and it like works wonder it is so
amazing and it just cleans your brushes
so fast which is obviously ideal because
you don't want to be like sitting there
for hours cleaning your brushes okay so
next is a little bit of a random
favorite I have been loving these false
lashes I just like grabbed from my room
this style called Daisy but any kiss
lashes are incredible I don't remember
buying these they might have been gifted
to me I'm not really sure but I've never
tried anything better in my whole entire
life then these lashes I was using the
Ardell ones for a while but the band is
so hard to get on your lash line at
least that's my issue with it and this
just makes it so much easier to put on
lashes I think they're really really
good
all of them look super pretty and
natural and fluttery and wispy and and
basically obsessed I don't think these
are expensive I think you can get them
at the drugstore I'm so basic but really
I like blinked a wall when it's it back
um this palette is the kylie burgundy
palette Kylie cosmetics honestly I love
it this palette is amazing I don't have
anything bad to say except like probably
wouldn't use that shade I mean it's
pretty I don't use it that much I mostly
use these two corner shades right here
but I love playing around with this this
palette just kind of calls my name
because it's all warm tones and you guys
know that's basically all I you just
really like it and all the colors are
really pigmented and pretty so I
definitely think it feel like a good
Christmas gift to ask for or like if you
want to give someone
this is a really really pretty palette
and all the names are really cute too
it's um chubby stick but clinique is
it's a sculpting contour stick is in the
shade zero one curvy contour and I use
this in I think the last video that you
would have seen it in was that holiday
inspired kind of makeup tutorial only
get down below if you haven't seen it I
love the look that that was created in
that but you guys would get to see this
in action this is amazing it just really
warms your face there's also a bunch of
dupes I think generally just like what
I'm trying to say about this is I love
cream contour Stix
it's used one from NYX that was so so
good at it was like double ended so if
you can find that it's basically the
same thing I just like love cream
products lately this is everything I
don't even know how long I've been using
this product for it's it cosmetics your
skin but better CC cream I'm in a shade
of medium which when I have a little bit
more of a tan but you guys this is so so
good it blends so flawlessly I was
wearing this a couple days ago when my
sister goes to your makeup on I was like
yeah I was like it looks so natural and
your skin looks so healthy she said can
I get some like working advisor
she's like freaking out it's this
product it's insane so it has SPF of 50
plus which is already so good but it
does kind of how cool coverage like you
can build this up I wear this almost
every day when I just even everyday wear
it's the best CC cream ever it blends
easily it's flawless it makes your skin
look healthy hydrated if I could
literally live off one product it would
be this and I recently rediscovered it
and I don't even know what I was doing
without it next to switch it up an
accessory you guys know these glasses
these are my forever 21 cheap-ass what
are these like little aviator clear
glasses I'm weird as you guys know I got
this in my fir
ever 21 clothing haul they were only $5
I don't know if they're still on the
website if they are I will definitely
link them down below for you guys but I
have no idea if they're still there it's
what your sweater thing is from Urban
Outfitters and it has a hood and it's
just like really really soft I've never
felt something so soft in my life and
comfortable and it also fits like really
nicely it's not like bawdy tire
flattering in that way but it does it's
a kind of hard to explain it just like
looks good you know what even though it
can be like loose-fitting or something
or like a little bit bag here but it
just you can tell like it looks to you
if you saw I feel like cute girl cute
sweater and love it like both with the
sweater does for you and I think would
be really cute with just like black
leggings and like sneakers and it's just
like a perfect California winter outfit
and I think it's really really stylish
how about talked about this perfume I
feel like I have I could like drench
myself in it this is a Chanel number 5
perfume it's the new one oh my god it
smells so good it just smells amazing
that's all I really have to say about it
it looks pretty it smells good it's
aesthetically pleasing what's not to
love
I just thought it throw it in there this
brush I have to talk about this is the
Sigma blending e to five brush it's
really dirty as you can tell but if you
I have a link to Sigma down below by the
way I'm affiliated with thin so if you
want to buy anything and use me like you
can or you don't have to I don't care
but I love this brush it's like rounded
perfectly so when you put it in your
crease you can just literally move your
hands like this and it automatically
gives you like a perfect like hollow I
don't know what to call it but it's so
good the love it and what I love it
gives so much to mention really this is
the perfect beginners brush because you
don't have to do much you just have to
like any like outer corner colors I'll
show you how to use this in my wallet
inspired make tutorial as well and it's
amazing also I have been again
rediscovering loving the
benefit walks up highlighter stick I've
been using this every day lately and I'm
obsessed with it it is so so pretty and
I love applying it with my finger and
then blending it out with my finger but
once on my finger really really makes it
so flawlessly blended and it looks like
you're kind of glowing within so it
doesn't look like you have a really
strong highlight it just looks like your
skin is naturally super super dewy and
glowy and refreshed and it's a really
good product so if you're looking for
like a higher-end cream highlight stick
this benefit walks up is so good and I
seriously recommend it and it also has a
blending side which I don't use and I
accidentally got black on it somehow so
definitely not using it anymore but I'm
sure I could clean it I've never used
yet I love using my finger but it does
have that option so that was it for my
November favorites I hope you guys
enjoyed this video if you guys enjoyed
it make sure to give it a thumbs up I
hope I can keep up with this everyday
blogging but with that being said I'll
see you guys tomorrow
