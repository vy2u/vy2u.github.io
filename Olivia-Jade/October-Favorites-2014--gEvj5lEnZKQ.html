October favorites because I didn't post
on Sunday and I'm so sorry I feel like
so guilty for not posting because I
promise I'll be posting once a week
every Sunday so yeah I hope you guys
enjoy and we will get started now
because I talk too much I only have a
couple of my favorite makeup products
this past month that I've been using
religiously and I'm going to start out
with highlights I've been loving two
highlights
and the first one is this Laura Mercier
highlight in highlight zero one just
comes off like a white pink pearl color
and it just gives you such a nice
highlight my next favorite highlight is
this Mac one which is so cliche because
everybody has soft and gentle
it's yeah it's and soft and gentle it
kind of looks like an earth to me it
this is what I'm wearing on my cheeks
and like on my Cupid's bow and forehead
and chin it gives off like a very nice
highlight and in here it's kind of pinky
I don't know if it's very pinky on my
cheeks I'm going to show you guys
concealer neck lately this Marc Jacobs
one um in what color am i I'm in wake up
call this concealer is the perfect color
for me it's a little bit lighter so I
use it under my eyes for a highlight and
I'm wearing it right now
you do wear makeup to school and you're
tired in the morning and you just need
something to cool down your eyes I
highly recommend it because it has a
metal tip so it's super cooling with
this it's super easy to blend out
because it's kind of it's not liquidy
but it's not like sticky it's like the
perfect in-between give this video a
thumbs up if you want me to do an
everyday makeup routine I don't know if
you do if you do though let me know down
below or just give this video a thumbs
up sign up lately I've been really
really liking the tips and the eyeliners
that go like this the only problem with
this is sometimes it's a little bit too
liquidy and it smudges so you have to
wait till it dries but if you do it
comes out so so nice I'm actually
wearing it right now and then my last
couple things I'm going to go on to
brows really quickly I've been using
this Anastasia brow Wiz and pencil
crayon
whatever in taupe which is the lightest
shade I like using the lightest shade
just because I don't have to worry about
going too dark with my brows because my
brows are naturally really dark and I
don't want to make them look like black
or anything so I don't look scary so
just like a blonde shade if I were to
get the brow pomade which is kind of a
gel I probably wouldn't get it in the
lightest shade just because it would not
even match my brows but since you're
just doing little strokes with this I
think it's fine and then my last two
makeup faves are these lip colors the
first one is this Bobbi Brown it's in
the color tawny pink number 10 it's on
my lips so you can see what it looks
like on it is so pretty and then a semi
dupe for this is the revlon colorburst
in sultry I just found this in my makeup
drawer and I'm not wearing it now but
they look really really similar so if
you don't want to spend the money on
this you can go to the drugstore and get
this one I actually found out this was a
dupe because I was just going through
all my stuff and trying it on I was like
wow this looks like Donnie pink so then
I put them on and they're really really
similar they're not the exact same but I
think they're as close as you're
probably gonna get and then moving on to
skincare
starting with my cleanser what I use to
wash my face as you can see I'm almost
done with it I have used so so much of
it it smells like grapefruit Goolagong
nice it smells like grapefruit you're
supposed to use this twice a day so I
use it in the morning and at night and
it's the oil-free acne wash pink
grapefruit a lot of words facial
cleanser nexor skin dry I've been liking
this a vino positively radiant intensive
night cream with vitamin B in it it
makes your skin feel very very fresh and
whenever I wash my face at night if I
just leave it and I go to bed it feels
like dry it feels like it's crackling up
and it's going to fall off and so right
when I put this on it instantly just
moisturize it I can feel like soaking
into my skin and it has vitamin B in it
which is really good for your skin next
I have this Kiehl's creamy eye treatment
with avocado in it I've been using this
for
maybe six months now this past month
I've really really really come to love
it and just be obsessed with it also you
can wear this with concealer so I could
put this on in the daytime and then I
put my concealer over it if I wanted to
and it would work it wouldn't even show
up you just kind of give you a nice
little shine there are these body shop
butter lotions
it's the Chia body butter and it smells
let me give you it I don't know what
Chia smells like I'm assuming it sounds
like artificial chia seeds
it's like fall and warm and cozy and
fresh all at the same time but it's not
like cinnamon spike which I get on my
nose but it's not like cinnamon spice or
anything this is the strawberry body
butter and it it smells like fake
strawberries if you ever had those toys
when you were little and it was like a
strawberry shortcake
and you smelled your hair did anybody
have to solve this and it smelled ish
like artificial fake strawberries this
is what this smells like and lastly for
skin care I don't really know what this
goes under but this is this vitae or
Vita tri dosha epson salt last month I
believe it was or maybe two months ago a
month and a half ago I fell off my
skateboard and you can see all my cuts
in my fall clothing haul I'll have that
link down below if you guys want to
watch it and you haven't seen it after I
fell off my skateboard I still went to
the Katy Perry concert so I was very
sore my head hurt my mom gave me little
epson salt and she said to take a bath
in it you'll it will kind of like relax
your muscles I don't make you feel so
much better you just put a little bit in
you it says add 3/4 of this bag and as
you can see I used almost all of it it
doesn't just come in bags like this it
comes in tubs if you like that there's a
bunch of different way epson salt comes
in it doesn't really matter which one
you get just makes your muscles feel a
lot better if you play sports if you're
sore a lot if you do gymnastics or dance
this epson salt is actually for you
you're supposed to soak in it for at
least 15 minutes next I'm going to move
on to clothing and the first thing I'm
starting out with is socks I would never
wear these outside my house but inside
my house
these fuzzy socks remind me of Christmas
and fall and just everything amazing
next for kind of in a soft pajama casual
thing these pants I've had for probably
a year I've been going for years hello
every Christmas I pulled these pants out
again and I'm really hoping they're from
forever 21 and I'm hoping forever 21
pulls through and makes more soft pants
like this because I got these so many
years ago but I needed to add them to my
favorites because I wear them every
night when you go to the cold or if you
live in the cold these feels so good
just like when it's raining outside or
wherever you live if it snows that it
doesn't snow in California but it smells
where you live lucky you because you can
wear these pants all the time next two
more favorites that I've been having an
obsession with drain this ball is in his
hat can't wear it because of course my
hair is up see what it mean though it
looks cute on your hairs down and my
sister got me it for my birthday and
lastly um for the clothing part if you
know me I'm obsessed with flannels
they're big and they're comfortable and
ones like this that are I think this is
like wool no it's not what is this I
don't know what material this is I'm so
bad and it comes to materials let me
check for you okay it's calling I should
note this one this fall has been my
favorite I wore this also in my fall
clothing haul I have about 80 flannels
in my closet and of course I chose this
one because it's my favorite for fall
honestly you can just wear this any
season and you won't look crazy so yeah
that is it for my October favorites I
hope you guys all enjoyed thank you guys
so much for watching and I will see you
in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
