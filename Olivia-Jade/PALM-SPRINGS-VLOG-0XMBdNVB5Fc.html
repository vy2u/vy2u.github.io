because everybody else let me tell you
what happened this morning so my sister
is he in Samantha the other girls that
are here they so George and I had to
sleep out on the couches and so Bella is
the in Samantha took the bedroom so we
were happy to sleep run on the couches
in the living room because there wasn't
enough room for all of us because
there's kind of a big group but they
decided that they were going to lock
their bedroom door and Georgia and I
were awake at what time 7:20 yeah and
we're waiting for them till 8:30 and so
then I go on their room and I start
pounding on the door and I made
everybody really angry oh I can make
these with Heights but no like the emoji
we have no idea where we're going right
now we're not allowed to golf till 10:30
because
yeah but we're on the range and now my
hands are blistering and they kind of
hurt from bumping without just love on
then I go to glove on and I just grip
the golf club way too hard
so that's happened so we just got done
with a fruit Shack all right we
officially have no idea where we're
going
oh I see the road yeah back to the Sugar
Shack sure Chuck Sam how are they
meeting us there they're trying to get a
cart Stone should I call them let's call
them and see what's going on I'm scared
okay guys so we're currently um so
there's a girl is she chasing us you
guys are the only ones I can see I'm not
quite sure if she is or not I look back
at suspicious yeah we look back in
suspicious but did she works here and
she was giving us so much attitude last
name and now she's in that blue car and
we drove past you like waved was a bad
flu in Georgia kept driving because
we're not supposed to have a car Jordan
keep go go go up this dude go up that
path right there yeah I have a great I
got a great excuse don't worry okay yeah
right we gotta go on we can only get one
card we're squeezing
you know what if you get hurt their
progress dragon tree we're watching
YouTube of course taking over her vlog
and what eating some pizza and I'm
drinking some water I don't have
including my shirt because Olivia stole
it
she's your shirt shirt robber you're the
real star you gonna put that in you can
think no we found two toads in the pool
today and we were both trapped so they
couldn't jump out to get to dry land so
my dad picked them up and chased
everyone with them instead of the video
insert footage there's a John his arm in
hands oh my god still frog everyone's
going to comment this animal abuse but
no frogs were harmed we save them
actually they would have died so you're
welcome frogs or Thor actually they were
toes but you know Andrew come back third
day of the trip and we're leaving today
and we're waking up really and we are
golfing I fit so bad hot ball game oh my
god
grab breakfast Oh
we decided that it would be a good idea
for us to come out and play some golf by
ourselves even though we're not really
school so we skipped hole number one
because there were workers on it that
leg get really strict and they get
really mad if you go and you're not like
good at golfing which is less um but so
then we were like okay that's problem
number two but then hole number two is a
huge lake before you get to the hole so
you have to hit your driver over the
water and we are not capable of that so
I'm going to hole number three but
there's people playing on hole number
three so now we're just sitting here I'm
reading but oh oh they're almost done we
stopped our golf or taking the golf
right because we just got kicked off
because everybody's super strict here
and we have to go and find them parents
to go which is super annoying but it's
fine we stopped to make yourselves some
ice cream oh that was such an
unflattering angle
somebody's gonna come by which way do we
get two whole nine
what's that how did it get to hold on I
already got there so if you keep going
this way you'll run into your mom cool
thank you
wait so we keep going that way with ease
I know peace oh oh okay cool let me hold
it now go because you can't believe it I
can't believe it I can't believe it
oh my god Mike on recording I think you
know hopefully guy us crash the car -
enough already so she should be on it
packing up quick trip we're really sad
by parrot day but you know it's fun
while it lasted waiting for my shoes
yep we're all really upset about this
wire out my shoe is under a cactus so
the trips over basically we came to Palm
Springs and say that's Club and then
every day basically we got up a
breakfast and yeah actually no not right
now
I know and do got breakfast and then we
drove in the golf cart and then we took
some photos and had dance parties every
day and as I'm in the pool every day
and it was really fun and now we have to
go so basically it was like a two-day
