different video as you can tell a lot of
you are probably confused by the title
of this video so I'm going to explain
why this is at all funny or relevant or
anything to my channel um but first yeah
as you can tell I'm doing a story time
you guys like story time videos I know I
like watching these but I don't know if
I'm really good at telling these I don't
really know what the situation is we're
gonna see how this goes but today I am
going to tell you about a story where I
pretended to be a psychotic full house
man from Australia at the fuller house
live taping show so if you would like to
see how this went down plus there is
live footage that was not clickbait my
sister filmed it and so did a couple of
my friends so if you want to see the
time I basically pretended to be aunt
Becky's number one fan then please keep
watching okay so let's just start with
that I'm insane sometimes I decide Oh a
lot of people are probably already
confused um so my mom I feel so weird
saying my mom is an actress and she was
Aunt Becky and Full House for those of
you that are kind of confused as to why
like this is why would I pretend to be
an Australian crazy full house man
that's why this was like a couple months
ago and it was the fuller house live
show we do this every episode it's just
an audience comes in and they get to
watch full house or fuller house film
and it's kind of like a sneak peak
before it comes out but they watch them
do these episodes or this scene over and
over and over again until it's perfect
it's like completely rough like it's
basically just having a group of fuller
house fans in the building
watching the actors and actresses just
on set like how they normally would be
they don't change anything for the
audience the audience basically just
gets to watch so my mom guest stars on
floor house because some of the og
characters are not on the new fuller
house anymore they do guest appearances
since I was in the audience my mom got
me my sister ticket and then we got to
bring each of us got to bring a friend
so I brought one of my best friends
Bella brought one of her best friends
and we just watched them film but in
between there's a warm-up guy
kind of hyped the crowd up when this
when the actors and actresses are taking
a break there something is over the
warmer up god whatever you call him like
that the crowd hyper like is like
talking to people interviewing people
giving out free prizes all this stuff so
he's going around um asking people where
everybody's from and I keep raising my
hand and he doesn't call him and people
are like Michigan Minnesota blah blah
and I'm like we're somewhere really far
away that like would shock him so he
talks a little bit and was interviewing
people and then the show they would
start shooting again so he'd have to be
quiet go sit back down and see and then
when it's break again he'd come back up
and hype up the audience again so
basically that's how it works he was
hyping the audience back up again and I
raised my hand again and I'm he goes
okay where are you from and I tell him
I'm from Melbourne Australia usually
when he's asking these people like where
are you from they just say where he um
he's like oh that's really cool like
thank you so much for coming out walks
away that's a new person of course Just
My Luck
he goes Melbourne Australia come on up
so I'm like oh God but you know keeping
character I was like okay this is really
funny
John Stamos his girlfriend was in the
seat right in front of me so she knew
that obviously I was my mom's daughter
Candace Bray who plays DJ's mom was in
the audience knew that I was joking so a
couple like like people related to like
full house people knew that I was an
Australian fan the whole audience and
the warm-up guy completely thought I was
an Australian full house fan so he
called me up and I walk up and he starts
playing like kangaroo music I don't know
why um well I do because I said
Australia but it was weird he's kind of
a weird guy that he's like asking me
questions all the stuff I'm gonna put in
live footage so you can see what's going
on
I can feel at home and who else who else
where you from I'm from Melbourne
Australia Australia come on tell us you
want what's your name ah Katie and where
you're from Melbourne what do you do
your long way from home your big fan yes
so you watch them on the one who's how
did you get here to the United States
I mean my gosh no you slam back after
I'm standing up there for a while I'm
speaking my Australian accent trying to
come up with a story he that's my name I
call myself Katie um weird stuff so then
he keeps asking me questions and I
realize like obviously I'm American so
my Australian accent isn't top-notch I
just watch Australian youtubers so I
like kinda can hear what it sounds like
but it's not a good situation every time
I said love I don't know how to say I
sounded like I don't even know where I
sound from it was not Australian oh
sorry I kept saying love like what does
that even sound like but my Australian
accent was starting to break so he's
asked me more questions and all of a
sudden I go thank you and I just walk
off and this guy's like weird I'm
telling you the warm-up guys like kind
of crazy so he comes chasing after me
climbs over chairs comes back to my seat
and goes it's rude of you to leave like
starts getting mad at me and I think
it's funny because I'm not an Australian
full house we have to start off with
standard British dialect standard pretty
styling and he's playing him out you
playing it out you said well you're kind
of ruined by walking away so he's
getting mad that I left and asking me
more questions than saying it oh so why
are you here blah blah blah and I was
like no I'm here for the show so what I
was really asking is how did you get
here are you an exchange student or why
are you denied the United States no I
just came like four days that's amazing
give her a round then he kind of left me
alone for a little bit of the rest of
the live show which was nice because he
was pestering me a lot because I walked
away so he was mad at me
oh this was the funniest part - he gets
mad at me for walking away and he goes I
could have introduced you to your
favorite TV show member but now I'm not
going to and under my breath where like
my friends can hear I was like no it's
fine I'll just see her at home but life
obviously I didn't hear that so it was
really funny I was like and then when he
said that I'm like no my god like please
introduce me it's my dream to meet it
Becky like please like pretending to cry
just like putting on such a show like I
just I was like oh then at the end of
the show so they keep wanting to keep
we decided to leave the show a little
bit early my mom knew about this dance
girl from Texas John that I was doing
this and I think Candace's mom told my
mom she knew my mom knew what was up she
knew I was being psycho and every so
often when my mom would walk by the
audience and stuff I'd scream like oh my
god I'm Becky and she don't really know
what is doing she just thinks I'm like
crazy so G didn't really faze her
because I'm psycho my mom takes the mic
I've kind of I think towards the end of
the live show and it's like asking the
warm-up guy hey where's that Australian
girl that's like my fan or whatever and
he tries to be funny he's like oh I
think she went down under like good one
then she told the whole audience and him
like yeah she was totally messing with
you like that's my child she's crazy but
she's my daughter he was so surprised
like so shocked the whole audience was
like cracking up I guess she told me
that they all were just like everybody
just was completely shocked I think
everybody just thought I was like a
legitimate psychopath in the audience
that's my story about I pretended to be
an Aussie in the full house five taping
I was obsessed with full house and hi
Becky I don't know if this is a good
story about story but let me know if you
guys want more story time videos you
guys got a kick out of this story time
thank you so much for watching I
seriously love you guys so much and I'll
see you guys next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
