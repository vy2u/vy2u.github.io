my channel I hope you're all doing well
today as you can help with title I'm
kind of doing like my nighttime pamper
routine this is obviously not a full-on
nighttime routine so it thumbs this
video up if you guys want to say that
got back-to-school night routine but the
first thing I do like kind of just start
off my night is I head down to my
YouTube home and I edit videos or just
make sure everything's good that was my
last video I just posted actually on the
screen if you can see by my head and
then I head up to my bedroom and I
finish all my school work for the night
or a browse through YouTube or whatever
I do before I kind of go and wind down
and take a hot shower and do all the
nice relaxing things I love doing but
first I'm marking off everything I did
on my planner today because it makes me
feel accomplished and it makes me feel
like a really great person so after I do
that I head into my bathroom um yes I
have shorts under that but I didn't wear
that out that's just my home outfit
anyway and that sweatshirt from Topshop
and I head into my bathroom and the
first thing I do is I take a nice hot
shower because I think that's like the
most relaxing thing
so to talk a little bit about what I use
in the shower for body wash I use this
amazing grace philosophy a shampoo bath
and shower gel and then for hair I don't
know how to pronounce their company name
but my mom gave me them and they're just
like really really good for
color-treated hair I've been loving them
so I think it's called I don't even know
I don't want to watch it but after I am
out of the shower I go and I put pyjamas
on or whatever I'm sleeping in
sweatpants um some sort of comfy outfit
and then I'll dive right into skincare
I'm showing my skincare beforehand so
you guys know everything I'm using in
the video but I am using this glam glow
super mud cleansing mask and then I
actually didn't show the clean and clear
night relaxing deep cleansing face wash
because I did that for deep cleaning
face wash because I did that in the
shower but I did show the laura mercier
flawless skin it's kind of like a rose
oil and it smells incredible and then I
use the it's a 10 miracle leave-in
product on my hair to make it super soft
when I brush it out so now I'm going to
show you me actually using these
products the first thing I do is I'm
using my it's a 10 leave-in miracle
product and I'm just working this into
my skin nope into my hair and then
brushing it all out with a huge paddle
brush because I have a lot of hair so it
really helps having like I know this
sounds stupid and pointless and me just
rambling but for those girls with thick
hair that are using like those really
weak bristled brushes try something
stronger I promise it helps and then I
just kind of like tuck my hair by my
ears if you guys know me my number one
thing I can't stand is when my eyebrows
are messed up so I'll just take twenty
five hours in the mirror to fix them and
then I will brush my teeth I didn't show
this just because I feel like we all do
this nobody really cares what people use
for toothpaste but if you're wondering I
use crest 3d something something and
then I'm brushing my teeth I'll go on my
phone do whatever um yeah you guys know
how to brush your teeth great and then
after I'm done brushing my teeth I will
go straight on to my favorite part which
is a face mask this is the gravity mud
won by this company called glam glow I'm
sure you guys have heard about them
they're kind of blown up right now um
this is not sponsored but I'm just using
this mask
I just got in
male:today sothanks glam glow but I'm
just going to apply this all over my
face and see how it works out for me and
all masks make my face really really red
and this one do too but I know that it's
working if that makes any sense so I
just apply this all over my face
and then I will just let this facemask
kind of soak into my skin and let it dry
a little bit it changes colors which is
so cool but while I'm doing this I just
kind of sit on my bed and watch videos
or edit or I don't know watch TV do
whatever I feel like doing on my
computer even if I have schoolwork I'll
do it at this point even though I've
tried to finish everything beforehand
because when I'm doing my relaxing night
kind of regime like skin beauty whatever
I like being completely stress-free and
relaxed so after this eventually dries
you can see it all turned a white kind
of color like a light gray I tie my hair
up and I get all this off my face it is
so so cool that it like completely dries
to your face it feels super crumbly and
then when you like splash water it goes
back to like a really liquid dark cool
colored gray so I love that but it does
take a lot of effort to wash this off
like you have to scrub at your skin and
unfortunately it made my skin bright red
as do all face washes or no face masks
except one glam glow one the kind of
light white one that peels off your face
have you heard of that that does not
affect my skin at all but kinda to treat
myself and calm it down I'm using my
rose oil from Laura Mercier of course
I'll link down below if you guys want to
get it because it's my favorite thing
ever but I'm just applying this to
hopefully cool my face down pull my
redness you're supposed to actually
apply this on a damp face or like wet
skin not wet but like damp you know but
I'm a little breaker so I didn't do that
and then kind of show you that my face
is now bright red but it's okay after
that I just kind of cozy back up into my
bed and that is basically it for my
night routine or my like night like the
end of my night thank you so much for
watching don't forget to Like comment

I will see you guys next time
love you bye mwah
