know yeah I have Olivia day so much fun
filming with you alright yeah guys easy
hey guys it's Olivia Jade wasn't back to
my channel
look at how are you mother is back
today's video as you can tell by the
title is reading hate you know what's
really funny about this video is I feel
like we'd never sponsee or really my age
to know like that's always our you're
ago longer Kagome outward like I don't
know I feel like both of our vibes
you're kind of just like its northern
ace focus on talking today yeah you know
like we don't want peace on this raised
beef almost just mean honestly though
I'm not gonna lie and say that like you
know people if you can say this like we
don't care about our haters we just
think it's funny yeah like we're two
seventeen year old girls putting
ourselves out there and investing
obviously we care to get hate comments
like we are you comin were like couple
choice and why I'm not going to do here
and say you know what we don't care
about our haters whatever we just try to
ignore me areas as we know about it not
give added attention yeah I want to give
them at the right attention but this
whole video is giving them attention so
here is the dedicated
also we're filming the same video on
male channel so we're only going into a
few on my channel and I'm going to do a
few on mouth channel so I'll link it
down below it will be the first link in
the description box and if you're from
my channel which go to Olivia yeah I
just think I'll be already subscribed to
Mel no I think you're God you should
head over subscribe say I said what's up
alright thank you okay my feet are just
inches long I'm doing some says I know
this brand it's so underrated like in
quotes like you said it uh-huh
and then she goes it has never used it
in a video that's not sponsored cuz my
fish market right well then maybe you
should shoot it to my live streams I'm
going my app and my other zone the
platform is I didn't use name of Jesus
what is it supports all get I'll back
you up on that she does I use the brow
gel today so I'm there on fleek simply
and I draw a selection it's a feeling
that you're not very grateful yes many
youtubers have a brand name products but
they make it clear that they're grateful
and make a clear disclosure however you
need to acknowledge that your
subscribers provide you with your living
and allow you to get Gucci Chanel etc
most recent grads will never be able to
get brand name and you should thank us
and be grateful for us every single day
I love you Olivia on subscriber thank
you show us I'm very she hit me with I
was very disappointed this relationship
thank you yeah um well I guess I'll
start by saying I am very grateful for
all my subscribers yeah I mean who is it
you're not grateful they're not in the
right yeah I'm very grateful for my
subscribers so I'm just going to say
you're probably wrong
I guess not my prescribers but YouTube
as a whole if you know how I cried Qi
and Chanel or have a living mmm-hmm so
I'm you show them to me you live with
you I live with my mom and dad and I and
you know what people like to come at me
but I'm very grateful for my subscribers
that is too bold
you just can't bash people on their
lifestyle because it's their lifestyle
and you shouldn't make someone and I
can't force a life role for what they
want you know it's like you you never
want like that books is enough about
hate people trying to I spend who you
are as a person so they like you in your
videos yeah true
you know and I can't control what life I
was born into I'm gonna start with just
something very simple right Mel
mmm-hmm you suck I hadn't really that's
not funny oh you bro
this made me very uncomfortable /
confused / annoyed smiley face he's best
smiley face three like three people
agreed with that it's four people one
yeah that they got on my monster bowl
confused and annoying they catch him on
video in a bad mood dishes it's over or
you are just annoying and confusing and
uncomfortable which all I am of course
yeah mouth she's so awkward
but I guess it's just like how she talks
I don't know what to say about this one
I think a video like on YouTube can't
really completely show like how you talk
how like you talk to people yeah I mean
you do feature a very like once a week
yeah and we're literally time to like a
camera as much as we're talking you guys
which we are you know which is like dope
and I think about that one a film it's
different because you don't get feedback
from people's rooms so like you said
what you are so maybe I did sum up that
I want to say people but a little I mean
you all you do get a little bit
delusional to to back me up on this when
you're sitting in a room for hours when
it's on your life went on you write
light this is like yeah okay what am I
going today on but this is the color of
Olivia and it's really her face annoys
me I feel about that well let me say
that her face doesn't annoy me I hope
you're watching honestly this makes me
mad when I see comments about your mom I
get mad you know like okay I read it we
know I'm gonna get that
I didn't know why this chick was famous
until I saw through her mama little
laughing face people want to see cool on
Becky's dollars with an apostrophe
Grammer kid I know this one is just like
bubbling inside of you do you know what
I mean I kind of feel it I don't think
all 800,000 people have subscribed
because of my mom
Tom Donald you mean oh that is yeah mom
what are you doing
I'm with mouth I didn't know why this
chick with famous until I saw her mom
was Lackey crying emoji people want to
see who aunt Jackie's daughter is oh
this one says okay I love you but what
list I love you don't you love me if
you're about the elytra day no offense
you know is customers oh why do you
always make that noise with your tongue
and lips so annoying I don't know what
you do in your videos with your lips and
your mouth some of them is called
English and speaking come at me bro
you're trying to be like everyone else
and this style doesn't suit you
so stop you've changed so much and I
hate it that's the word change makes me
change why is it making it why is it
thing to change is good people change
the grow up thing learn to become more
confident why has changed negative I
don't understand
I certainly YouTube when I was in ninth
grade going into high school and I think
that's when kind of people start seeing
like who they like hanging out with like
what how big they like wearing at school
stuff like that right so my style could
have been very different then because
now like I don't go to school yeah you
know like whatever a lot of change in my
life that also allowed me to want to
change my style and also this is a style
I like to wear I don't know what like
style that is except stop like what yeah
hard one but like if I stop wearing
myself drawn with me but eyes naked
definitely go to my channel if you guys
want to see the other part we did in
your video and remar made up responding
Feliz and also ice cream say please
don't leave 8 to get in one of these
videos no I will probably never film
this again finding me calm endo I took
my soul yeah you are listening and also
I just want to do a little shout out to
all the people that support us I know
that's so cheesy and like obviously this
video is kind of a joke but I feel like
we have to include it because we are so
grateful for all of our subscribers or

excited to see what VidCon and meet you
