my own money but thank you for all the
girls at merchant roads you guys are the
sweetest I changed my mind I'm getting
this earring instead of this one and
back little cute room I'm going to take
my shoes off because they hurt my feet
but what I'm sorry you can't see me that
what I'm about to do is film a video
that talks about my app which will
already be up by now I'm also going to
show you guys a quick little haul of
what I got Marc Jacobs took us shopping
so first I got this really pretty
earring yeah and it just goes down your
ear like that I think it's really pretty
just great little yellow Marc Jacobs
purse and it has a shop it looks like it
doesn't but it has inside I think it's
going to be so cute for summertime I
don't know I just think yellow is such a
like a random weird color so I love that
and then also I stopped in Mac before
the brunch for Marc Jacobs and I got a
couple things and this morning my makeup
artist used the shade out here that
stripped down and it's like the most
perfect round nude so I got that I then
got the shade boldly bare since I've
just heard a bit about it I also got the
shade spice because I heard a lot about
that and then I just picked up like a
clear gloss and because I just I love
these colors so much I want to wear them
on their own and then just put like a
clear gloss over it so it kind of looks
like a lip gloss so we're ready a little
bit of a change in hair and makeup
and my office so I think I'll show you
in the mirror we're heading out to the
mud Jacobs party there's a little mirror
somewhere in this fake fur jacket just
to keep me warm but I'll eventually take
that off and then it's like this just
looks like this it's this cute little
fat from revolve and it's like a royal
blue and it's silk and then just like
blue boots because it matches at school
