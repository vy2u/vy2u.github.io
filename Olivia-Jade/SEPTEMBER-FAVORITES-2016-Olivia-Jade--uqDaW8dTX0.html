so sorry I didn't post last week um I
had strep throat i now have bronchitis i
had a sore throat and i also had a sinus
infection anyway um today either can
tell by the title i am filming my
September favorites so if you guys wanna
know what I've been loving for the month
of September please keep watching and if
you're new and just happened to stumble
upon this video
hey I'm Olivia I post videos every
single Sunday and if you want to join
our fan then you can subscribe I'm fun
I'm a fun teenage enjoy my channel okay
alright let's get started it first
started with something a little bit on
the random side um it's the new Chanel
perfume it smells so good I know it's
like a little crazy to put in my video
because it Chanel and it's expensive too
you guys know I always try and find like
affordable things but if you haven't
wanted to like splurge on a perfume or
you just need a new one this smells
amazing it smells really light and fresh
and it just it smell classy and it
doesn't it doesn't have like any sort of
like you're kind of into that masculine
fragrance this isn't it at all it just
has like a really fresh smell and it's
amazing and it's brand new okay so for
makeup this highlighter is everything
I'm wearing it right now and it's the
trusty umm what is this maldis
luminescent highlight and perfect
multi-purpose stick I'll have a link
down below per usual as all my favorites
will be linked down below but I'm not
even kidding when I tell you guys that
this highlight it's not like like a
Becca highlight or anything like that
works just like you wipe it on and it's
like pop but this is so buildable and I
like to putting it or I love putting it
on a wet Beauty Blender and I'd
kind of like go like this and then put
on my cheeks and as you can see it just
looks like you're glowing from within
it's like the most beautiful highlight
ever and it's cream which has been kind
of like one of my favorite types of
highlighters you guys know I love a good
powder highlight but it is cream so it
just looks really really beautiful and
now it's perfection I promise
for my lips on my lips today I have tiny
little lips but I have the kind of lip
liner in Malibu along with the lip kit
I've had this for a little while and
just kind of been playing around with it
and thought it was appropriate to put in
my favorites after having it for quite
some time I'm only wearing a lip liner
on my lips today but I know that the
actual liquid lipstick is beautiful I
love wearing it laughs it's not streaky
and if you guys like this color that's
what I'm wearing and I thought it
included in my favorites how many
questions do I get on my uneven eyebrows
because for some people for some reason
people seem to like them even though
they are sisters not twins
but um I'm going to do an eyebrow
routine I promise because I want to show
you how I put all these products to work
but everything is almost Razia and this
is my routine so I fill them in with the
brow Wiz and I set them with the brow
gel and after you go through steps first
and then highlight with the pro pencil
eye shadow primer and color corrector
and then I like take this flat brush by
autist nausea it's the number 20 and I
brush it like I make it I'm gonna do an
eyebrow routine but I just want to show
you guys my favorite eyebrow products in
case you were looking for anything new
and I just the pencils so easy to work
with the gel keeps them set all day the
highlight and the brush to apply the
highlight make your brows 'el ten times
more put together okay something that
I've been loving that goes on my lips is
this beauty counter um I don't even know
what this is lip conditioner and
peppermint my best friend works at
Beauty counter right now
- something with them and she brought me
like a whole I've never heard of them
and she brought me a whole like a little
goodie basket of like their stuff and
honestly this is like the most I don't
even know like hydrating lip product
I've ever tried because it has
peppermint it kind of stings but like a
good tingle I don't know how to explain
it but it just like my lips have been so
chapped and these this product - saved
my life I promise okay it's incredible
and I'm going to try it find a link for
it down below I just don't really know a
lot about it so we'll see what happens
our skincare my most asked question ever
what do you use I use lanser products
now I have gone back to Lancer if you go
way back in my videos you guys know
these are my router guys and I finally
got new ones they're just so expensive
it's like hard to pick them up you know
cuz they're very expensive
this little favorites video is a little
bit expensive but I want to share with
you guys honestly what I like so I'm
sorry I'm sorry if it offends you you
can't afford it at the moment but you
know what to save up for if you're
looking for one of these products and
like you know I don't put anything I
don't love my favorite stuff but that
being said it's the method
cleanse and polish and then the method
Norrish sensitive skin and you use the
polish first and then the cleanse and
then I just finish off with this
moisturizer and the second I swear to
you the second I started using these
products I know the next day I have
never
results a quick the next day my skin
looks better and I was bringing out
pretty badly on my chin and I've tried
to cover it a little bit but it's gone
down a lot because of these products and
I think the clean and clear products
broke me out unfortunately so behind
back diet lastly for my September
favorites I know this video is quick and
I'm talking really quick but it's cuz my
robberies flashing and it's like causing
me serious stress I want to talk about
this glam glow gravity mud firming
treatment it's this mask but what you do
is it's clear and you take a makeup flat
like like a brush like this like a
little foundation brush and you dip it
in and you paint it all over your face
and then you wait about 20 to 30 minutes
until the whole thing is dry and you can
peel it off I'll insert a picture of me
of it on me right here but um I love it
so much because you incidentally after
you take this off you instantly feel
really fresh and clean and that's like
one of the best feelings for like a nice
pamper and this mask is everything and I
like that it peels off because the worst
thing ever is scrubbing a really hard
mask off your face so that concludes it
for my September favorites I know it's
not an overwhelming amount of products
but you guys know I'm keeping it real
I'm just showing you what it Jen we've
been loving for the month of September
and I hope you enjoyed it um thank you
