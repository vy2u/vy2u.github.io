today I am filming a September favorites
happy October I can't believe all of
September is already gone it's crazy but
timber was a really really really good
month for me and I found some great
products some of which I've been loving
for forever ago or it's since forever
ago I just haven't shared them with you
let's get into the video and I really
hope you guys enjoyed it so first I'm
gonna start with jewelry jewelry and
only one thing it's my choker I have one
on right now I have another one this one
has actually like a little chain up or
like little key chain up what is this
thing called the charm called charm
where is it it has like a little C I
just want it to be plain so I just
twisted it around and they're from
brandy melville and they really aren't
expensive at all I love it oh this one's
my navy blue one I have them in all
different colors I have a rainbow on a
pink one a red one a yellow one a green
one black maybe light blue there's just
my favorite things I like I like them a
lot I think it just adds something
different to the look next I have
pajamas and if you know me you will know
that my obsession with matching pajamas
is is it's weird
it's it's weird so I was on forever 21
looking for some outfits because I think
I'm going to do fashion videos like some
affordable ones and somehow I ended up
in the pajamas section and hello that
shirt it says what the fluff matches
with these pink pants
does it get cuter than that don't answer
that it does it actually does get cuter
than that with the grey ones the grey
ones but then the gray shirt has like a
little fox on it
and it said it wasn't me it really
doesn't get cuter than that I'm obsessed
with those so those are like my favorite
pajamas ever and they're so comfortable
and I mean it's however 21 so it's not
that expensive I just love them
next let's get onto the makeup which you
know is my favorite I have really been
loving the morphe palette I love this
palette that pigment is really good as
well this is 35w
I love 35n as well and these are all
matte and they're super super super
super neutral so it's kind of hard to
just go wrong with this palette and it's
kind of everyday but then also like the
dark colors and like kind of the fun
ones colors colored ones are fun to just
play around with my all-time favorite
which is just oh that's not me this one
is in 35d and I love this one too just
because it's so different and it has so
many cool tones and like I just really
and then this is my favorite one which I
want to actually show you it's just like
it couldn't get more perfect if it tried
this is the 35 t pilot buy more feet and
it is my all-time favorite thing it has
the most neutral warm toned I got a
really passionate about that it's just
really really beautiful and it like and
it just if you brown eyes this is
especially just with your dark skin or
even light skin because like if your
fair those Gold's if you like blue eyes
or green eyes green eyes are the
Purple's the golden the Browns are
beautiful for blue and brown eyed so
it's just like an all-around perfect
palette and guys the colors are actually
really creamy like Hello
next one of my favorite lip colors which
I have on my lips right now it's like a
brownish nude it's like a lip stain by
Mac and it's in the shade Boss Brown
side which dries of like a stain which
is just like very drying and it has a
gloss if you want to gloss it up I don't
gloss it up I just leave it Matt and
like dry but I love the color but it's
so so pretty and it lasts a long time
because it's a stain next I've been
loving my tart my tart um Park
Princess Amazonian clay waterproof
bronzer have this on right now also with
my Bobbi Brown brick Hilah and put that
in my favorite six seven times so I did
not include it but if I could it's my
favorite ever
anyway this is the Tarte waterproof and
it has like a little bit of shimmer in
it but it's mostly matte and it's just a
really nice bronze or it's waterproof
which I love because I love blue on the
beach and even though I'm not really
going to the beach as much anymore it's
still amazing and it just kind of stays
on your face all day you don't really
have to worry about it moving and lastly
for my favorites I have been loving my
polaroid camera this is my red water out
of a blue one I don't know why I have
both but it is just adorable
