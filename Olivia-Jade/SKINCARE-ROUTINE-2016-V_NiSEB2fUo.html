I'm doing a very requested skincare
routine before we get into it I just
like to announce I know I'm not a skin
specialist dermatologist or facialist
I'm just showing you what I do since
it's super requested so let's go the
first thing I do is I just tie up my
hair I'm straight out of the shower so
my mascara is running down my face it's
the whole zombie drill right now I look
just horrifying but I just pin my hair
up so it's prepping my face for skin
care and the first step is I clean my
skin with a micellar cleansing water
I've been loving my Garnier skin active
micellar cleansing water I used to use
the pink one religiously but I switched
to the blue because it removes your
makeup a lot more and it just takes off
excess dirt so I just rub this all over
my skin and specifically under my eyes
where I have mascara running down my
face
number two I cleanse my skin with my
go-to face wash so two options here I
either do a facial cleanser or my
cleansing balm by Colleen Rothschild if
I'm going to use my Colleen Rothschild
facial balm whatever that is it's when I
have a lot of makeup on I just wanted to
show you since this is a skincare
routine another alternative that I do
use but this is not something I use
every night what I use every night is my
philosophy one-step facial cleanser as
I'm showing you right here I just rub
this into my skin and it removes makeup
but it also just does a really good job
at keeping my skin clear and it removes
makeup as I said so it's amazing and
yeah so I basically just rub that into
my skin but basically the calling
Rothschild one is kind of an oily feel
and it just takes down your makeup and
like breaks it down like you would not
even believe the foundation that I make
up everything it's amazing when you have
a full glam look on that you need to
take off and then I just pat dry my face
with a towel after this step 3 as I tone
my skin with my favorite toner what I
love about this routine is I really feel
like you can already use the products
you have in your house you don't have to
go out and buy everything because the
steps are so simple you don't have to
have the same products at me unless one
of your products isn't working for you
then I suggest trying one of mine
because they all work really well for me
anyway I'm just applying this all over
my face and I'm not I know I should know
especially should've done research since
this is a skincare routine and multiple
people have told me what toner does but
I always forget then step four I
moisturize my skin with a night cream or
face moisturizer depending on how dry my
skin is so I believe a night cream kind
of goes deeper into your skin
ignore my boyfriend about this video he
likes he likes to mess with me while I'm
filming and just be a pest basically but
anyway I think this so I'm using the
night cream in this video and it
recharges your skin and refines and
moisturizes it's amazing it's just a
little bit more intense than a daily
lotion lotion I believe and then what I
like to do with that or what he likes to
do with that is just like spread it all
over my face
he used way too much so I had
eventually go in and spread it out but
it was funny and then after I'm done
with my moisturizer there comes a very
important step that's crucial in my
skincare routine which I will get to in
a second and he's back
you can never blend that in too much you
know okay
drying cream is very important just to
ignore Tyler in the back for this heart
but drying cream or a spot treatment or
anything like that for specific
blemishes changes my life it really
clears up my skin so either use this bio
clean drying lotion or my clean and
clear acne spot treatment advantage what
I love about this is the drying cream
dries out the blemish or the spot
treatment I don't really know exactly
what it does but I know it works really
well for me so big fan and then that is
it for my skincare thank you so much for
watching I love you and I'll see you
guys next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
