singing I looks great you're not
supposed to say the one he goes in five
four three two and then it goes I know
you see sometimes you world will change
from me guys welcome back to my Channel
today I'm here with my sister Bella
everybody always asks were asking us to
ask if anybody always asks if we're
twins and the answer is no I'm a year
younger
she's a year older and this is Auburn
he's our mom's teddy bear and their moms
teddy bear she's obsessed today we are
filming a snapchat Q&amp;amp;A the last time
Bell and I did like it just a sit down
regular Q&amp;amp;A we gotta think like over
50,000 bees so I thought this that I saw
on this would be a good video because
everybody seems to like this um or want
to watch them or maybe just like happen
to watch them so on snapchat I saw you
raise your eyes damn it I saw on
snapchat we asked you guys to send us
some videos of your faces asking us
questions and you did snapchat open
buddy I'd like to ask you a favor season
is and we're gonna ask you more so yeah
please reply okay I even favorite season
and your dogs so cute is it that no and
they said season my first my brain
jumped like TV show Oh yep
I think my favorite seasons either fall
or summer I like Paul fashion but I like
summer weather and just like being at
the beach and go to school I think I'm
allergic to this teddy bear because it's
making me simple wait get out of here
over it I was me my favorite season is
summer because it's just such a great
time I think my French
oh she's so cute you're adorable we're
gonna answer the second question she
asked and it was how do you stay
confident or how do you power out of
this cover and she's French and sorry I
was a little quiet my volumes like not
like that good of my phone you first
just have to be like you have to accept
yourself you have to realize that
there's like nobody else on the planet
like you you're literally the only one
so I think that's really helpful I was
watching Maddie Brad's like confidence
video and that's kind of like last night
because I saw Neriah tweeted about it so
that so then I started watching it and
most boring story over okay for more
free I think Florence Italy
you've been dick I know okay I loved it
my favorite city hi Rosie I love you too
and if I could be anybody for a day I
would probably be I've answered it so
many times with Jimmy Fallon I got to
take that back I want to be that with
that guy Gordon James Corden
oh yeah want to be James Corden because
I think be really funny to do this car
interviews if you haven't seen them look
the body you don't
and you're not getting any questions um
I don't really balance school with my
YouTube as you can see haven't posted on
this YouTube channel in a month but um
just gotta learn to just put YouTube
before school - schools salt not
important don't listen to her schools
are very worried schools really
important I agree I don't think I should
wait go to college if you want if you
want know if you can then go if you have
the opportunity to go then go to college
says somebody that's never been to a
girl that's a really cute boy that's a
very good question I think what we find
about most is probably I take all her
clothing without asking her so she was
really mad about that because she has
such fucking silence my god if you don't
understand like I'll be at home or I'll
be out or I'll be at school I'll be
doing something and all of a sudden
she'll put something in her snapchat
story and I'll look at it and it'll be
like my shirt that's like you didn't a
scatter or like my shoes will be missing
I'll call her ass but I don't have that
and then she like come home and guess
what the shoes are under beep so it's
not true that doesn't happen with my
boots twice what boots build these ones
what are we born over most you annoy me
that's never happened ah I can't touch
you
Oh what are you going to be this um we
bond
we don't bond a lot we gotta eat yeah
it's true how do your friends react when
they know your mom's on the house and
nobody really cares honestly I think
people care then don't then we probably
aren't friends then I think there's
probably like a few who do care and like
they kind of make it obvious and it's
like well you
did you see that nigga's result or talk
like we're not like Bach we want to be a
friend if you like like flaps or enjoy
it but I say like make a big doubt of it
and like we feel like they want to be
friends with us because our mom is
famous then we're just like I took a
left that by then
back back back she's really pretty puff
together a good family and Levy on
fuller house
wait wish right now no we don't wish um
okay
we kind of cool uh we are not going to
be able for our house and we don't
really watch the house as a family but
sometimes if it's on all of us we'll
just like sit down and watch it just
like because it's like honor my mom will
be watching it and we'll walk it into
down and watching that my dad will come
in he'll watch it and then my dog come
in and she'll watching my brother
sometimes Tom and he'll come and watch
it
um like not but not like often it's not
like a thing okay
yeah yeah but where is it you look nope
stop it's not funny
