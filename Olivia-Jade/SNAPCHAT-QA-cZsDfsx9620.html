channel as you can tell by the title of
this video I am doing a snapchat Q&amp;amp;A I
think I've done two or three other
videos like this as you can hear it I'm
a little bit sick
I've caught like this awful cold so I've
been home from school for two days and
now it's night time I've caught up on my
schoolwork that I've needed to do so I
just wanted to film for you guys
I'm really really drained and really
really really tired I feel really sick
but I've been really good about posting
and I didn't have a video to edit and
upload so I needed to film something and
I think I posted just about a week ago
exactly or maybe eight days ago so I
don't want to let you guys down um I
wanted to film something and have
something to put up because I've been
doing pretty pretty good pretty pretty
good now I've been doing well with my
posting schedule I don't really have a
schedule but just about getting videos
up in content so I wanted to stick with
that so yeah I asked you guys on
snapchat to ask me some questions
you guys can add me on snapchat right
here if you haven't already and let's
get into the video I'm so excited I love
seeing your faces when you ask me
questions
okay so I think maybe I missed the first
part of the question I'm not sure but
basically I think the question was just
like what do I do if I'm going to new
high school I'm leaving with my friend
I'm going to be solo alone it's better
for her but she doesn't know how she so
much hand movement um how she's going to
survive high school some might call it
um I think my advice for that is I was
kind of enough but this year I
transferred schools and you have to know
that high school or just really any
school is such an amazing place to make
friends you're going to encounter people
that you're not going to like and not
gonna want to be friends with and you're
going to meet a lot of a lot of great
people we're just going to leave that
question in Nighthawk
hi I love you too I'm to cope with
stress I'm a stress eater this is the
worst way to cope with stress ever
whenever I'm stressed I put on so much
weight because I just eat so I eat but I
also think about that think of it like
this in a few years you're stressed
right now on the school project on this
or whatever sure it could be a really
big project or you could be doing
something really really important you're
really stressed about it but a few years
you're gonna look back everything's
gonna play out the way it was supposed
to and it's really not going to matter
that much so I guess that's the way to
cope with stress just put it into
perspective of life you've got a lot of
time left on earth you've got a lot of
life to live so don't get stressed about
the small things
baby just like up your biggest and
probably some nice you can you do a coma
up and eat it because if I'm use your
friends and
okay shall we you're adorable first let
me go see if I remember what the fan
account name was what were the questions
can I do a club of Aden um
yes maybe I will talk to her about it oh
I'll show in this part of the video he's
a great kid
I just wanted to ask what is your
favorite part about being a youtuber oh
my gosh you're beautiful hi I love you
too my favorite part about being a
youtuber is I think it's a different way
to express yourself I'm an awful artist
I can't draw I'm not a really great
writer either so I don't really love to
write I think it's just a different way
you can kind of put it your so you can
put what you want on it and then I've
built myself like a big friend group
kind of so that interacting with
subscribers is I get them it's an
amazing thing about my youtube channel
as well oh my gosh you're so cute that
was from Megan I wish I could give you
advice with this I think I'm kind of
struggling with this too trying to find
my path good balance um I think that if
your best friend has told you in like a
nice way and she's been straight up with
you then give her the respect and tell
them that you love her and that
obviously you don't need to do this but
you have to make time for him to make it
work you're gonna try to make time for
her just talk to her communication is
key um and then just really plan out
okay boyfriend this day best friend this
day if your best friend wants all the
time and never wants to see your
boyfriend that's a little bit unfair but
if she's willing to be fair about it and
you
to have sleeper with her this weekend
and then the look so you can see your
boyfriend and whatever and just balance
it out I think that's best
so just talk to figure out why it's
upsetting her if you fully just blowed
it off I could understand why she's
upset but it doesn't seem like you're
doing that it's not you have it's okay
to balance it I'm boyfriend and I'm
still learning how to try to balance it
with friends Barbie at my cousin is what
do you do when you forward and I forgot
to mention that I really really really
oh my gosh ooh so cute thank you um what
do i doing I'm bored I somme YouTube
videos hey you don't look awful I'm sick
too so we're in the same boat
uh-huh how did I build up the courage to
create a YouTube channel honestly I
can't even remember I have to realize
something that I really enjoy doing am I
going to let Outsiders and people who
are honest at the end the day teasing
you because they're jealous are you
going to let them affect you no well
maybe you are but then you're wasting
time and energy on people that don't
even have your best interest so yeah
I've really been through a lot this year
but one thing my YouTube channel has
taught me is I really don't care what
people think about me and I think that's
really really good quality I picked up
on cuz you could hate me you could
despise me you could hate my videos you
could think I'm so weird and guess who
doesn't care this girl
hey love you too and tips to be not just
out of school plan don't crane that ride
such a gross laughs I tried to laugh and
then I sounded like I'm drowning in my
call I love these types of questions
every time I laugh I sound like I'm
dying but it's a guy uh-huh how do you
get your crush to like you back without
telling him girl you got to get with
your girlfriends and plan like secret
for commissions and be okay got this day
you got this guy so me and my friends
used to do this that's in like fourth
grade um I like this kid or whatever so
me and my best friends would be like
okay like all secretly I message him and
be like hey what do you think about
Olivia I have to really don't suggest
that because that's super obvious um
okay real answer is be yourself be nice
flirt a little if they're reciprocating
good if they're not back up a little bit
I think the first way to getting
somebody to like you is becoming friends
of them getting them to know your
personality and know how awesome fun you
are and then the rest is up to them you
can only do so much
hey Mia um how do you deal with the
question was how do you deal with fights
and drama at school and it's will be my
last question just to finish out the Q&amp;amp;A
the best thing you can do is just um
whoever you're fighting with just kind
of separate yourself from them if this
is a fight you think you can resolve
then I wouldn't do the whole BS it can
more than gossip bla bla bla bla get
other people on your side try to ruin
them
that's stupid if you want to be friends
with this person again then you think
you guys can resolve whatever fight you
guys are having I would definitely just
go up to them and have an honest
conversation apologize if you did
something
tell the know you're upset if they did
something and I would cut all the extra
couple weeks of ignoring and gossiping
and getting into a bigger and like worse
fights because you guys are just mad at
each other not stupid but I think if
it's a situation where you really don't
even want to be friends with this person
anymore and you just kind of want to cut
them out but you're in the same friend
group or you don't know how to do that
or you have to see them at school or
whatever I think just it's okay to be
nice to them still but maybe not talk to
them if they talk to you there's no
reason for you to be mean just be nice
be short with them if you feel affected
by something they did or if you're
really hurt by them um I think the best
way is just to have a bunch of different
friends beside them don't worry about
that I know it can be hard but really
just kind of isolate yourself from that
specific person or that specific group
and just make a kind of new friends and
then with your new friends don't talk
bad about that other person and don't
try involve your new friends and not
drama because they're just going to see
you guys dramatic and that's not really
going to go well for you so yeah I guess
that's my advice
for that um which concludes the QA I
hope you guys enjoyed it if you did make
sure to give it a big thumbs up thank
you so much for watching I hope you all
enjoyed it and I'll see you guys in my
next one bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
