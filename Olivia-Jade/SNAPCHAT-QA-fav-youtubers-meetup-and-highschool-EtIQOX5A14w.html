sorry it's been a little while well not
that long just like not following my
posting schedule it's because I was on
vacation so I didn't bring my camera and
I didn't pre-fill so sorry about that
but let's get that out of the way so we
can jump into this video super quickly
because I just answered so many
questions that I think it's going to be
a little bit of a longer video but yeah
so I just answered a bunch of questions
I had you guys send me video questions
on snapchat and I showed me answering
them and it was so cool it's way cooler
I feel like it's more personal than a
Twitter Q&amp;amp;A so I might keep this up if
you guys liked it then give it a thumbs
up and yeah let's go ahead and get
started to a question when you have a
meet-up and you have a pillbox so I can
send you stuff could you see that sorry
and the first question was when you're
gonna have a meet-up oh my god that'd be
a dream come true if you guys ever seen
yeah just come up to me you can be like
a little personal Lita but I don't know
um oh my gosh probably if my channel
grows a little bit more just because I
feel like all you guys live in different
places right now so it'd be kind of hard
to do a meet-up um but maybe next year
when I go to VidCon or beautycon or
something like that I didn't go this
year because I was traveling but next
year I'm for sure going to go to those
so hopefully then and then the other
question was tube appeal box and I do
have appeal box right now it's strictly
for packages for businesses but I've
been thinking about opening it up I've
been thinking really hard about what
bringing it up so I could get some
letters and stuff and do like an opening
mail video from you guys which I think
would be kind of cool so um yeah if I
open it up I will tweet about our
snapchat or put it in the description
box on my youtube video but as of now it
is not public the next question yes that
my question for you is who are your top
five youtubers okay my top five
youtubers that's a tough one I love I
said this is another Q&amp;amp;A but I really
like Shaunie's videos I like oh I like
Shannon so I love Jaclyn hill
and like Lauren Perez and my fifth one
oh and Carli bybel I love her videos by
Bell I don't know how to pronounce her
last name but she's all the make up
girls
I really like them because I like makeup
obviously how is your dog Bianca she's
five what kind of sickness have you lied
about so you didn't have to go to school
haha that's such a funny one uh my mom
watches my videos that ever she already
knows I fake it um well sometimes I'm
actually serious
whenever I'm seriously sick I end up at
school somehow but when I'm faking it I
somehow to convince it's usually when
like I'll pretend I have like a really
sore throat or something something that
you can't take the temperature of or go
to a doctor for so don't lie about being
like one time I lied and I said I threw
up the night before and like had the
stomach flu which was just not sure
sorry - I love you - and um who or what
I guess just sorry my hair I like keep
looking to befriend her and I hate it I
guess something that inspired me to make
youtube videos is obviously like my love
and passion and like just adore beauty
and makeup and fashion but a person that
inspired me to make it this might sound
kind of strange but my um she's kind of
like an older sister to me her name is
Meryl and um when I wanted to make
youtube channel everybody was like no
it's kind of weird like don't do it like
only weird people do it which is just so
not sure by the way um and she would
know do it to do it so like she pushed
me to do it which was inspiring to like
do it so I guess my girl Meryl I don't
really know you rather
your eyebrows look good or your
eyelashes I Rev eyebrows for sure and if
you give this at any city in the world
right now where would it be
I have no idea I don't know I want to
know what your biggest fear is my
biggest fear is time going by really
fast
how old does I want to make youtube
videos I've had my channel for almost
you now it's been like 11 months I think
I post my first video August 13th hope
that's right
um so I was 14 and now I'm turning 16
so yeah that's 14 hello yeah I'm just
wondering what meals your favorites no
breakfast lunch dinner or dessert and
what is your favorite be able to have
during that meal my favorite meal is
breakfast but in the summertime I don't
like breakfast when I have to wake up
early in school and I'm like forced to
eat but my favorite meal is breakfast
technically brunch um and my third thing
is pancakes or waffles and lunch I
really love because I love pizza so
that's funny
I really I'm excited for my mom I guess
and yeah I I think it's cool what is
your favorite makeup brand hi Emma my
favorite makeup brand is I really really
love Smashbox lately
I love Sigma I love love Laura Mercier
left shin L love Maybelline and I love
L'Oreal any anyone for a day who would
you be I could be anyone for a day who
would it be
I've answered this before and like a
bunch of like Arab random stuff I beat
violet what are some tips about the high
school whether it's like something
little or like something about
friendships or relationships just
absolutely anything oh you're so cute
um tips for high school is this is like
my main tip that I would get give
anybody no matter what age you are um I
don't even care like even if you're an
adult and you watch my videos just stay
out of drama never back stab or talk
crap about anybody because I promise you
it will come back around and bite you in
the butt so that's my biggest advice
stay out of drama there's drama coming
your way
run for the hills be nice to everybody
don't talk smack about anybody because
trust me it will save you a lot of
stress in high school if you just or
whatever age you I don't talk bad about
anybody that's like the one thing my mom
has told me since I was like a little
it's just like stay out of drama and I
when I was in like fifth and sixth grade
did an awful job at that so in high
school I was good about it though and
I'm and I scored that to Congress driver
Palmer's yeah is one of your biggest
fears of um my biggest fear on YouTube
well I guess it was more in the
beginning of my channels what people
would think of me people finding it all
that kind of stuff but I don't really
have a fear anymore I'm really like
happy with my channel and I'm like happy
that I make videos obviously because I
have you guys and it's fun I mean if you
love it you shouldn't really care what
people think that was something that
really stressed Meredith beginning but I
guess something like that I don't really
like about or like kind of scares me as
like a fear I guess is like when people
watch my videos in front of me that's
just more like awkward to like that's
just like weird I guess but like it's
not the fear I don't know so my question
for you is
okay I'm gonna replay it
two for you is what song like can you
relate to what song pilot describes your
life right now and why what song can I
relate to what some kind of just cranks
my life
I have no idea that's such a good
question that oh I couldn't I don't even
know that's a good one is there a lot of
peer pressure in high school for like
drinking and smoking whatever um no you
guys don't wanna do something just say
no you guys are adorable by the way but
always just do what you walk away you're
comfortable with you don't want to drink
don't drink if you want to smoke don't
smoke nobody's going to like peer
pressure you into it so honestly um yeah
do a room with make sure you have to
learn how to say no though if you don't
want something say no because that is so
important to anything would be thanks I
love you all love you too and
change refers to anything
probably something braxton I love that
name was talking with my friend
yesterday I love you too and I answer
this question the beginning but Smashbox
anything really from Sephora Chanel
laura mercier benefit to face all those
hi Mariana I'm Isabella and we want to
know what your favorite Baker brand is

hands that in the last one but oh my God

hi Olivia I was wondering what college
do you plan on going to and what do you
plan on majoring in oh I have no idea
I'm just going to be a sophomore so I'm
worried about tenth grade and when I get
to that boat I will sail better make
sense when we get to that bridge I'll
cross it then but I don't know right now
oh yeah Olivia so first of all I would
really love you and my question
is what to do to stay fit or money feed
that's healthy for love me too and I get
this question a lot to do like my
fitness routine which I would do I don't
have one
maybe don't work out literally I don't
do anything to stay fit which is bad and
you should always exercise not even
cause like oh you want like a specific
type of body or whatever like what you
think looks good it's literally like
health for your heart so you don't drop
dead of our attack like run I like to
but I actually have this app called
seven on my phone which is like seven
minute workouts and you can like buy
stuffs Wenlock like you're at your
cardio whatever whatever fat burn
whatever and then I just use that when
I'm not lazy oh yeah I'm not sure it's
too late to do this and it's not for the
Q&amp;amp;A video I want to know what are some
of your favorite singers and bands my
favorite singer okay I used to kind of
be iffy with Iggy and now I'm just I
love her I think she's so cool cause
your favourite singer or like band oh my
god that was so weird that was like
backed about questions um he hasn't just
said and my favorite song right now by
her is trouble I love you got my
question is what you want to be when you
grow up something I wasn't started to
make a youtube channel thanks bye
okay digression and the first one is
what do I want to be when I grow up and
it's going to be I want to be something
doing either an actress or fashion all
that like create my own fashion line
makeup line that and then who
environment making YouTube channel um
not a specific person inspired me but
people really pushed me to do it and
that's which was my girl Meryl
traveling to different cities to do like
hangout sessions with your fans
diving TV oh um I would not call myself
famous oh my gosh that word it's just
like oh not me
but um yeah of course I would travel
anywhere to meet like my fans which I
use that term and the term famous so
loosely because I really don't believe
I'm famous or anything like that but um
yeah would definitely that'd be like a
dream watch 9:02 and oh and if you have
who's your favorite half I watch and I
don't know um yeah I watched the whole
thing which was kind of weird and my mom
really bothered me on it I was like I
hate her character I was like you're
such an annoying mom on there and she'd
get so mad at me she'd be like but um I
like Niomi dog we had the VIP tickets
and I am not sure how much it was
expensive for my sister's birthday and
hi Olivia its Jenna and I want to know
what is the best part of having a
YouTube channel and I love you so much I
love you too Jenna and the best part of
having a YouTube channel is being able
to just like post when you want connect
with you guys
express like your creativity and stuff I
love makeup and fashion so putting that
together and kind of educating other
people in it even though I'm probably
not the best teacher but I think it's
fun and like seeing your comments and
even people are like oh you made my day
when you posted a video like that means
so much to me so
maybe already just came to school and
how's it going everything oh my gosh
you're so cute hi I'm have a gun and
we're cool this summer this summer I
have stayed home for a lot of it which I
like but I just got back from Aspen
yesterday I was in New York and I'm
going to Nantucket in August and um I
forget to have your questions in hey
mommy I love your channel so much and my
question to you is what made you want to
start YouTube shares a channel it's
called Kyle Grace with two E's I think
yeah um Kyle Grey's two E's Kyl EE grace
shout out to you and one may want to
start a channel is my love for makeup
and fashion oh thank you have youtube um
but I ever gonna make over to my fan
once again I don't I use the term fin
loosely because I feel like that's like
Taylor Swift has fans but like um
probably not unless it was like a meet
up or something but I wouldn't like go
to somebody's house to give them a
makeover if that makes sense because
that could be kind of weird
are you having me America sometimes back
to school tips is go school supply
shopping because it's so fun and I'm
going to be doing a whole back to school
series like outfits global hair makeup
fashion I said makeup and hair in
fashion yeah hi Olivia

the world is pepperoni pizza so like

favorite ice cream flavor of you I
you're so cute and I love you too am i
near ice cream flavor is cookies and
cream Baskin Robbins in a cake cone
double scoop that sounds really enough
I'm a huge fan of you and my question
for you is if you can live anywhere in
the world where would it be
I love living in LA so probably why I
consider a career in makeup um I
wouldn't ever want to be a makeup artist
such as I love makeup I wouldn't want to
be my artist for a whole living because
sometimes I get like kind of like antsy
when I'm doing other people's makeup but
um yeah like if I could like make my own
makeup or like skincare line or fashion
line or anything like that's kind of
entrepreneur type then for sure and
