I've always told me I have a delicate
stomach

very special guest his name is Caspar
Lee my mom says I'm special as well
she's a struggling youtuber so make sure
you get good and some like really like
fun yeah and your party these days on
YouTube I've been here forever now you
can you click notifications water makes
me look like I'm very a square
I was just thinking you were very
professional person and then you told me
you died does fashion I think it's
really actually I really like it because
I really like please you don't I mean
okay guys we're gonna answer questions
and eat gross food past when you're
gonna ask each other for questions we're
gonna switch back and forth we're gonna
pick an item shoes I need my questions
yeah don't anything that's stuff we
could do before we start like no sorry I
just remember a moment okay so guys
Casper is gonna continue to try and put
me on topic but I'll ask you the first
question so I'll choose what you have to
what we'll start with number one garlic
well Olivia knows I'm a serial data so
she's trying to make sure I don't dare
date tonight and sorry to whoever's
gonna do
that's not happening anymore I'll have
food poisoning more than a handsome
next is a raw egg raw egg cup of right
away rah rah rah
yeah you anything roll roll roll Lloyd
and a spoonful hey dog treat this is my
least favorite sardines or artichoke
we don't know paranoid well because
they're not cooked so it's just gonna be
time impossible to eat we're gonna try
another I just saw them I was like this
looks bad
sir you roll the dice okay if you do
that one okay okay artichoke that's not
bad
they've give me enough to really eat
back what is one secret you've kept from
your subscribers intentionally once you
know about so many things
once you know that raw our future yeah I
know feel like if it is a secret I'd
kept I don't know if I should share any
time it's giving me the gang feeling
well okay
do you know good first we did really
like these things I mean that's a
breakfast bacterial infection we take me
to work here my legs it's a riot I'm not
taking the top of that I was leaving
yesterday and I saw that you had next
boyfriend they don't even know what do I
have okay oh god I think I should I
leave and you have a little talk to them
about it what's the real reason you two
broke up okay this is about not bad
because
hey I'm just not gonna have that know
the real reason my wife and I broke up
is because he went to college oh I'm
sorry I'm so happy I did enough to take
a shot ironic that means hope so bad I
come over throwing up on camera I feel
like this is gonna be me just not
answering a single question and you like
bluffing
raise your hand if you've ever felt
personally victimized by the DJed do you
do that
sory you roll a dice for me please get
counseling twice yes sorry don't know
Casper Olivia
how many youtubers have you hooked up
with and who are they you can do if you
do part if you do a half of the question
you can have half of it if I said zero
would you like sound like you can't I
mean to a lot of YouTube events so I
mean I mean you don't even know who you
she was off the time yeah not that many
to be honest think it would be you
really I mean I think I would say like
four clients are definitely they would
they would just probably see me looking
for arrogance - that's really - I can
think of
you pull this yeah now just saying that
no you only got half of it yes I just
feel very unattractive right now
Casper's never ever gonna come on my
channel again no siree roll the die
again yes since we're all so you hook up
questions I didn't know this is what
this is about where you know you're
gonna go there who's the last person
you've hooked up with who is a very
modern Instagram that there was another
problem basically that's why I included
that you started I've never uh terrified
on Instagram okay then you've never done
with any other person who does like eat
you know even kiss like but that's what
I mean let's say sorry roll the dice
okay
it's Muslim who it's the worst celebrity
that you've had oh okay
I actually get onto this one okay then
why because I have a good way of
explaining it I've met like some really
really cool people 99 would not actually
all are gonna be nice all in that would
be nice
so when you say was there still really
nice okay sure but basically I just
thought he was more tired and in a rush
and all the weights it was someone else
I'm gonna say Mark Wahlberg was just
tired and he was really nice guy but he
was like tired and you can see they
really want to be there for that final
thing with weird day but the reason I'm
going to take
l8 is because it was someone else who
died remember who was actually yeah you
don't get it that's the worst one that's
something I like you I love you think
bustard when you have too much mustard
it's like chocolate
Thanks
just wanted to know if you could roll
the die so that is this idea that's
literally the second worst to in my
opinion because I've experienced most of
them by now
who is like a YouTube girl that you and
your friends don't like oh you don't
like like you actually would never want
to hang out and you've had a bad
experience with they must become one
anyone cuz I don't know I just don't
think what they stand for is good you
just don't walk sorry this is your last
question your last question is who was
your worst hookup and why was it bad
their name concent a name but she is oh
it's nothing it's not that bad it tastes
just tastes like I'm going to excrete
God for the rest of my life
roll it again no I'm also watch boss
question you can also on who's the least
every member of your family
everybody you need the whole thing
brother yep I want you to fish little
thing otherwise you have to do the I
mean you are just the right person way
one of the chances of the one you a
coward on celery and you I guess you
learn nothing about me you guys so much
