today I have a night routine this is so
highly requested so let's just get right
into it the first thing I do is I get
home from school and I set my phone and
backpack down on my kitchen table and
then I head into the fridge and get some
food I'm always so hungry after school
and lately I've been trying to eat a
little bit healthier so I'm just taking
out like forget what this called it's
some healthy bread though I think it's
like Dave's something bread you can see
it on the cover right there but I'm just
toasting that and I believe it's sixty
calories per piece
I don't really check calories that much
but I think that's better it's a good
snack I take that out of the toaster and
then just put some turkey on it for some
protein by the way if you're wondering
why I changed it's because when I put my
bread in the toaster I just changed into
some different clothing because I was
uncomfortable in that dress all day so I
take that out of the toaster I put the
turkey on it and then I go and sit down
and eat my snack and just kind of look
through social media Instagram Twitter
read my emails look at YouTube comments
on like my youtube app and then I get up
get a water and I start my homework ever
since I was little my mom kind of taught
me just to get your homework done when I
got home straight away from school it
makes it so much easier so if you
procrastinate try getting home eating a
snack having your little time for your
phone and then just sit down buckle down
do your homework it's a lifesaver for
those of you asking I'm in school you
know just as much as probably you are
I'm a regular high school student 7
hours a day I don't do online or
anything like that so I feel your pain I
take out my notebook and then what I
like to do is just write my agenda so I
just kind of write down what I have to
do for the night homework wise and
studying wise so I just write that down
and then after I'm done with my homework
I head upstairs and I am starting to
workout a little bit more
so I go up into my room and I get some
socks and my workout shoes and luckily
I'm already in workout pants these are
from Lululemon so yeah I just changed
shirts I'm in my workout gear and then
I'm heading to my gym to go work out so
I head into my gym and I did the stair
climber but okay so I was going to do
the treadmill but I couldn't figure out
how to turn it on my sister figured it
out there was like a side button I had
to press so then I just went to the
stair climber because my gym in my house
just was finished so I haven't used it
yet I've been mostly doing SoulCycle but
anyway you can see I'm struggling with
this little bit but yeah this is the
stair climber and I am just climbing
fake stairs and it hurts your butt and
legs so badly so after that I go ahead
and shower I didn't wash my hair but I
just want to show you guys what I used
since I washed it last night and I just
got my haircut and they told me I
shouldn't wash it every day so those are
all the products I use they will be
linked below and then I'm showing you a
little skincare preview I'm gonna do a
whole video on this because I do some
other things besides just this but I use
my ponds cold cream cleanser and I
remove my makeup with this this is my
favorite makeup remover I am so over
those Neutrogena wipes because I feel
like I'm tugging at my skin so I love
this it's just a cream it's super soft
and it just removes makeup so amazingly
and also that purity simple cleanser
that was just in my shower that tan
bottle that was clear bottle with like
that tan product I use that in the
shower to wash my face and take off the
makeup and then I go and after my shower
and I use the ponds cold cream and then
this Garnier micellar cleansing water on
a cotton pad and I don't want I wipe my
ponds cold cream off with this wipe here
because it's so much more gentle on my
skin I'm not tugging I know it's going
to prevent wrinkles in the future and
then I go in with another face cleanser
I'm very diligent with my skincare
because I don't like acne so I just you
know massage that into my face and then
I wash my face and this next step is
kind of essential to my skincare and
that's toner wait let me let the video
catch up okay so this is my Matty
skincare toner I just put this on
cotton pad and rub this all over my face
I said this in my morning routine
recently which will be linked down below
if you guys haven't seen it but I don't
really know what toner does because I'm
not a skincare specialist but it works
for me and then I use my hydro carrot
lotion this is for irritated skin so I
really love it it's super gentle and
that's my skincare and then I go and put
on some comfy clothing
I'm just see I wanted the black ones but
then I switch to these big comfy grey
sweats from H&amp;amp;M and just a regular top
and then I had done to the kitchen and
eat some dinner i my mom picked up
salads from this restaurant called the
Scala
in LA and it's good I I mean it's just a
salad I wasn't too hungry since I also
had that after-school snack which was
pretty filling so the little salad was
really tasty but usually we have dinner
as a whole family since I was just
filming and my timing was off my sister
was in a tutor my mom was with her
friend inside the house so yeah we
usually have dinner as a big family my
mom usually cooks and stuff but tonight
it's a little bit different so I just
kind of showed you what I was doing
tonight but it's usually with my dad my
mom my sister and sometimes my brother
if he's home and then I come back
upstairs and I brush my teeth and by
this time I know it looks bright but
it's usually pretty late by this time
and I'm pretty much done with all my
work and everything so that's really
great that's why I love doing my
homework right when I get home I crawl
right into bed I watched them youtube
videos and that's it so thank you so
much for watching I really hope you guys
all enjoyed it and I will see you guys
in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
