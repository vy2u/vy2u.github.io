little thing disappeared so I lost all
my shorts now have one pair of my closet
now well not you oh listen the first
thing I got actually the only thing
well no I'm only showing one thing
because since we're doing part 1 and
part 2
yeah we're showing some things on my
channel something's on earth so one of
the things I got it so shop that I'm
going to show you guys is this
sweatshirt and I'm obsessed with it and
it's gray it's just like a heather gray
and it says you guys are maybe on it and
it's really cute and I got it in a
medium so it'd be like kind of oversized
cheff feel cuz Olivia made me like love
oversized sweatshirt because she just
wears them so much and they look so cute
and I was like alright I just need to
hop on that so and then the back looks
like
like this next I got these high-waisted
jeans thank you
they look extremely small when they're
all is it the famous together of it the
top shark moto inter Joanie Joanie the
Joanie one TomTom meadows Joanie style
and then just are like really high
waisted maybe that's why they look so
they look so awkward and ugly on camera
look how weird they look and then when
you look at them everything so small and
in personally look even taller and
murder and then on that's something my
jeans because sometimes I look so weird
but you have to try them on because you
could be a trick pleasantly surprised
well I'm done with Topshop most wanna
finish it off yeah finish it off a few
more things from Topshop so I'm just
gonna go through that really quick I
said that honex from Topshop I really
needed um I also mentioned this whole
entire video I lost on my clothing so I
don't have any t-shirts literally ask
Mel do I have anything my closet no no
Vicki no I love it all it could have
been more basic it's just like a really
white t-shirt white shirt you all know
my obsession with oversized sweatshirts
but it's so cute honestly I got this
gray really I'm sorry it was really big
grey oversized sweater isn't number
eight
oh and that wasn't me like for baseball
but no it's in them but they had number
fours - so if you're into that but I got
anything in a size large because it's
really so I got a size large I really
saw they really instead of their
sweatshirts are these softest things
you'll ever feel in your life and it's
kind of a good ray camo of a situation
situation should we move on to Brandi no
let's me won't Brandi hey everybody I
announcement
oh uh was this graphic tee and honestly
I have been looking for graphic tees for
really long time as I feel like they
just look so like edgy and cute and with
like jeans or ripped jeans like it's you
know it's a cute outfit so I got this
Guns and Roses black um t-shirt and but
it's kinda like faded and I think it's
really cute and then it's vintage
yeah and it says Guns and Roses on
then has some schools the first thing I
got from brandy is just a striped
long-sleeve tee but it's like sweater II
almost she had is kind of sweater you
super sauce it's just like Randy's our
material but I mean since you lost like
all of your closet clearly the next
thing that I got is actually pretty some
related I was proud of myself um is this
red tank top but it's like has a little
white stripes on it as you can see and
it's really cute I was picking between
this or like or like just was it like a
red crop top that's like a financier
grandma but I love you help me get this
one choose this one and I'm happy
because I think I want so much cuter
because the red one was just cropped and
it was like an actual short sleeve and
yeah it was just think and I like the
lines and like I don't know design and
it's a tank top so for summer and you
know it's just good little basic staples
to have next we're going to show this
together because we got twinning she got
matching t-shirt OMG its head Led
Zeppelin fun fact when I was little I
used to be a look when I was four my dad
would play Led Zeppelin around the house
and I would know all the songs and like
run around dancing and then it says at
the bottom United States of America in
1977 but it's like a light pinky color
right and then kind of like behind my
shirt cuz I yawn anyway oh that's kind
of cool I was kind of boy you try
definitely was that in or I had one more
thing take it away one more thing from
random album I just got another basic
white t-shirt it's so plain it just is
you're just a good state I love it
because it's not cropped I need some
like non-crop stuff in my closet
especially for the summer I know like
that's when you think you've ever cup
but I am like not confident to wear
coaching should be your kite zone I
don't like wearing mob stuff then we
popped into Zara and Mel didn't get
anything because there was really just a
limited amount of stuff and it's like
I'm so like super my style either it got
this off the shoulder it's not really
not a sugar a dress it's just dress it's
right I think it to me cute in the
summer because it is all the shorter
side or if you just wear it out and then
we're some like nice and euchre's it
could make your legs look nice
you can see but it's striped it's like
really tiny pinstripes and then it's
just kind of like this you know what I'm
saying
I don't know you'll probably see it on
my headshot Ram right or the other
sleeve it's chopped chocolate it's no
sleeves
thought it might go up over your
shoulder hole but I don't really
remember I tried it on that I liked it
blast I got from Varna this is for sure
chocolate I like this um this is my
obsession so it's like this kind of Gein
material but it like doesn't feel like
you like it soft it's like like denim
down but not intimate fabric fabric
denim it looks like denim but I didn't
feel like it's just like off the
shoulder throw I think it seemed that's
kind of the style I went with from Zara
