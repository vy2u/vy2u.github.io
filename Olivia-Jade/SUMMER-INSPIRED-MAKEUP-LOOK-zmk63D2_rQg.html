excited to bring this video to you guys
I am very sorry look for their color pop
launch so I need one of the most amazing
shades its kind of star of the show this
baby is the star of the show this is not
the only thing that comes in the
collection I used all Sigma brushes and
this amazing bronzer my Sigma I went for
something really really pink and fun and
dramatic I would never ever normally
winter switch whoa
the skies are pink red uh but anyway so
I never got my comfort zone into a pink
pink pink I just like brownish moods
Pink's but this is straight-up
paint and I love it I think it is so
amazing and if you guys are not enjoy it
that's totally fine but I really think
you guys should just test it out it
makes your eyes pop oh I love it and I
also have this glow skin tutorial for

please know if you create a look using
their products from the color pop mod
that make sure to use the hashtag color
pop and hashtag Sigma beauty for a
chance to be
drew on their Instagram and yeah your
doom let's jump into the video I'd like
to announce because I don't want to get
comments like this because I see this on
other youtubers comments and I'm like
some about what anybody trying to do oh
okay
seriously whatever I know a lot of
youtubers always say before the videos I
really would never ever ever ever ever
use something that I'm not sure or
comfortable with or even like and that
is always an percent true at least
coming from me I definitely not I'm not
getting paid to make this video they
just sent me their colorful collection
and I got so excited and I'm one
tutorial in it because I love the
college so much if I didn't like that I
would send the right back can be like
sorry I don't want to ever promote
something that my subscribers may not
love so just won't get that out ever
because I get a lot of emails that are
always asking for a few products and let
me try this and send it you can have a
coupon code free to subscribers mama
kind of stuff and you'll get paid
through this and but I like my
subscribers trust a lot more than
anybody so I would never act remember
many little product meals because I've
never heard of it I didn't want to try
it
yeah oh and it's something I haven't
heard of I always like I think back like
if I like you can sign it over to this a
person if I like it that I because if I
don't I'll send it back so I'm just
going about to do that obviously and
this intro is bajillion years long so
let's get started starting out with the
face since this is a summer inspired
makeup tutorial I want something light
dewy glowy just full amazingness
so is that word I'm using my Maybelline
BB Creams all over my face blend that
all in and then I'm using my Maybelline
master conceal and I'm just placing this
under my eyes on my forehead on my chin
blending this out with my Sigma small
duo fiber brush I think it's the f55
brush I believe and I'm really just kind
of taking that everywhere blending it
all out and the key to making a dewy
beautiful skin a dewy beautiful skin is
that even English know um is blend blend
blend then I'm taking this large powder
brush by Sigma and I am just using a
stay matte powder by Rimmel and setting
my whole face and then I'm using a
smaller brush to focus under the the
powder under the concealer so it doesn't
crease and then guys I'm going in with
this amazing blush it is in like the
bronzy color that will have all the
products link down below and i'm using a
sigma angled contour brush with this and
i'm placing this on my cheeks on my
forehead as you can tell I'm like really
psyched and buy this bronzing blush and
I'm literally putting this down my jaw
down my neck then blending it out with a
big powder brush to make it look more
natural and then I'm going in with my
favorite highlight champagne pop by
Becca cosmetics and look at that just
take a moment
ah that is so nice so yeah I'm pretty
much just highlighting I got a little
carried away I got so thrilled I like
brought it down my nose I put it on my
chin my Cupid's bow and on my forehead
and I just I couldn't get enough of it
now for eyebrows I'm first
brushing them back and then using my
Sigma brow powder duo and
I'm just filling in my brows um yeah I
just kind of speed through this because
nothing too interesting and then I bring
you a little closer and we're priming
the eyelids with the concealer we used I
poked myself in the eye and just
primetime prime it so the veins aren't
showing through and then I'm setting
that concealer with just a mattifying
powder so when we blend the eyeshadow it
blends easily and then the star of the
show I am using this Sigma oh goodness
me what is this called I'll have it
linked down below blending blending
blending in to the crease here I'm
starting out with this and then this
color is honestly just started English
star of the show the whole time I'm
using that mac fix+ bright to make that
shade or this little single shadow more
pigmented it oh would you look at that
is just so pink and looks like a foiled
eyeshadow once you put that mac fix+
on there it is amazing you can use eye
drops as well or just water or spit
that's kind of gross and then I'm just
taking that on a kind of synthetic brush
and just by Sigma and just really
packing that all over the lid to make it
so stark and just so so so opaque it's
amazing
and then I'm taking that same shade I'm
not picking up any more just on that
same brush dragging the leftovers on the
lower lash line and then going in with
my Kat Von D tattoo eyeliner and lining
my top lashline not to do any designs or
wings or anything like that but just
honestly to give our lashes a thicker
and darker effect and then I'm just
taking a mascara I'm using this new Dior
one that I got which you don't have to
use obviously you can use a drugstore
one or whatever mascara you really have
and then this amazing lip product which
everything will be linked down below
because I'm totally forgetting the name
of everything and yeah that's the
finished look thank you guys so much for
watching I love you all and I'll see you
guys next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
