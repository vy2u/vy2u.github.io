another vlog in today's video we are
starting off the day with workout I am
headed to the gym to meet up with my
trainer and I will vlog it I will let
you guys meet my trainer Michelle we
will show you guys a few moves what I do
in the gym I'm just like a little mini
workout situation and then I have lunch
with an older friend of mine Bella and
myself are gonna meet dry up for lunch
and then you know it should be a really
fun day so it is 9:20 I workout in
literally 10 minutes so I have to get to
the gym right now but I will see you
guys when I get there
[Laughter]
I just wanted to talk to you guys before
I start driving I'm not driving I'm
still in my parking spot but I just
finished my workout I don't know how
much of the footage I got from it I
tried to get some good footage with my
trainer but it's hard when you're
working out so I set it up for a little
hopefully there's like a little montage
of me working out in here somewhere
I'm gonna go to creation and grab a
green juice and then I have lunch in a
few hours I wanted to stop by my p.o box
right now as well just to pick up the
packages before the holidays cuz I'm
sure a lot of brands are like setting
out holiday packages kind of remember
that was a big thing last year so let's
do that and let's also hit my peal box
up and then it'll be a successful day so
I'm currently getting gas in my car cuz
I literally am almost out I actually
tried to get gas yesterday fun little
story but for some reason okay you know
there's different types of nozzles like
at different gas stations and different
ones where you can like adjust it so it
stays up and you don't have to manually
hold it the whole time but the gas
station yesterday it was a confusing one
so I literally just every time I would
try to like clip it so it would just
like stay there by itself it wouldn't
work so then I just gave up because it's
too hard oh I'm I'm good sorry for the
quality change and this lighting my
camera died I'm gonna grab a smoothie or
green like a green smoothie I get banana
cinnamon almond milk and spinach and
it's really good from creation and I'm
sure you can make it at home so let's go
do that
and then I will see you guys back on
stunning this is absolutely stunning
gorgeous okay so I just got home and as
you can see all this makeup is on the
floor those are all like sectioned off
into little piles it for a giveaway for
you guys for the holidays I'm gonna
start that giveaway I was supposed to
started already like last week but I
have been crazy busy and I haven't been
on it I can admit I have to build up
boxes to put all the stuff in and then
also for my peel box I'm gonna save a
lot of the boxes
companies ship their stuff up in and
reuse them so I don't have to buy a
bunch of new boxes because let's recycle
it's a waste if I do that so I gotta
open all these boxes right now and then
I need to get ready for lunch
and I really don't have a lot of time so
I'm gonna do a little montage of me
opening up the boxes and I'll show you
no actually I'm not gonna do montage
I'll show you guys different little
things that company sent first of all it
cosmetics sent a really sweet note for
the holidays I've got some brushes and
skincare fades oh I forgot about this
moisturizer this was my favorite and I
ran out of it
I cream my favorite CC cream yeah they
even know my shitty North brushes you
guys know I have millions and millions
of brushes so I'll probably end up
starting a new giveaway pile with some
brushes and some lovely stuff so thanks
for edits you're the bomb guys I really
wanted to try the new Too Faced palette
it's like the chocolate bar dipped in
gold and then they also have like a new
highlighter and then my favorite mascara
I really want to play around with this
and I'm sure I'll do a tutorial soon
okay I'm sorry we're back to the foam
camera but I went back to open more of
my p.o box boxes and this insane box
from morphe came this they have like
liquid lipsticks all these amazing
palettes jeez this is crazy it was wild
so I think the last thing you guys saw
was me in my YouTube room and I was
opening up like pale boxes and sorting
through some stuff the quality's change
because now I'm back on my camera I
charged a little bit we're going to
lunch right now I'm with my sister
I mean all of you change what were using
before that my phone my camera died and
now we're gonna get some salad at this
nice little place called the Scala and
yeah that's the plan see that make it
look prettier say hi I can't I already
ate it well sorry guys
Moretz wait prettier my shinier with
tomatoes I got out there see ya as I
make it good luck we didn't make it into
the bog alright we're at lunch okay
excuse this part of my forehead I am
breaking out right there and then I just
touched it and then I made it red but I
have realized that this vlog right now
is probably on the shorter side because
I've been like running around town all
day I've been trying to clean my YouTube
room and my camera keeps dying so it's
probably about to die again really soon
but I got a really big package from
princess Polly actually the code with
princess Polly it's oj 20 have it on the
screen right here doesn't benefit me at
all but it does give you guys 20% off if
you use it so I just did so like I was
Canadian so if you guys want to shop on
participate you guys totally again um
with a little discount code I want to
show you guys what I got cuz I can't
even remember what I picked up the first
thing is this amazing big jacket it's by
the brand I am Gia I have it in tan as
well
so I love it and I want it in black and
it's just like this big bear jacket and
it's so comfy and cute love alright oh
oh right the so dress is absolutely
precious it has like these cute little
flowers all over it and I'm going to
Mexico pretty soon well in like a month
I really want this for my Mexico trip
and I think it's gonna look gorgeous
such a pretty little summer dress oh yes
the bees are sick they are these orange
pants and I believe it comes with a
matching pop it does really cute really
really cute oh yeah I really wanted one
of these little braids I have one oh
this one's like a thicker one that's
gonna
oh I like this it has like a little band
around it can you see that when you put
it on well
yo what's up Olivia you guys get the
juice won't link your hair it down it
could look cute this little top again I
was thinking for Mexico obviously I
can't wear this right now but it's like
this little bra let halter kind of thing
and you aren't with like cool boyfriend
jeans and sneakers or something I don't
know I really wanted this little black
dress because I have it in green and I
wear it all the time and it's just like
it's really just a simple black dress
with a little tie but don't you just
feel like you always need this type of
staple but you don't want sometimes you
don't want the one that's like body con
black mini dress because it's too tight
and if you're bloated or you're just not
feeling your good healthy confident self
maybe you don't want like a skin-tight
dress to run around town it this one's
perfect cuz it's a little bit looser and
it has like a tie that cinches your
waist this is like your perfect black
dress so that's awesome
oh yeah I thought this little ripped
t-shirt was cool
just as adored on it and then it has a
snakeskin I work out a lot and I really
like workout tees that are cut like this
shows off your biceps I love these
little tops they're like the most
comfortable cuz I just little sing lips
but this one's just like a nice neutral
gray and they're very soft shut up I'm
so excited these pants have been a dream
of mine oh my god
