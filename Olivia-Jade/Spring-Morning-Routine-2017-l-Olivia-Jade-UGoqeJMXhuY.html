today's video is a very requested at
spring morning routine so this is an
actual legit big morning routine this
was a couple days ago
I set up my camera the night before so
you could really see what happens in the
morning so I first wake up and go on my
phone I know that's such a bad habit
it's just this generation but I go
through social media so I check
Instagram I love checking Twitter seeing
all the different tweets and updates and
messages and DMS and also like all my
app and I say what's up I say hey I love
my app for just connecting with you guys
it's kind of like a big texting group
chat just Olivia Jade in the App Store
and after all that's done I get up and I
go to my bathroom and I just head down
into my bathroom and I first start by
taking a shower today was a really busy
workday for me I was filming all day for
my app so I wanted to make sure I was
nice and clean I used my Neutrogena
cleansing oil to break down my makeup if
I had any left over from the night
before which I usually don't but just in
case use my Lancer cleanse and polish
and then I also use this amazing grace
shower gel and then a little bit of this
wet skin moisturizer and then brush my
teeth I love brushing my teeth you can
really it's very rare for me to not
straight like get up and brush my teeth
I can't like go eat breakfast and do my
thing I always have to brush my teeth
and then I go in with this net Nasir I
go into the landside the method Norrish
cream and I just apply this apply this
I'm such a beauty youtuber I just put
this all over my face and rub it in and
then I go in with my Lancer sunscreen
because it's going to be a hot day at
the pier I went to the Santa Monica Pier
that day so lets putting some sunscreen
on and then it is time to freshen up so
that's what I used to smell good and
then picking out an outfit this is a
daily struggle especially when filming
but I knew it was going to be super hot
so I went for one teaspoon jean shorts
which I like my favorites and then I
just kind of went through
looking for a top in my closet which can
kind of take a little while these days I
need new clothing I'm over my clothing
which is so bad I just take out my
makeup and got glammed for the day I
didn't show my makeup just because
everyone always says my makeup looks
like the exact same so didn't want to
bore anyone but I kind of sped through
some of the products I used real real
quick and yeah that's basically it I
went downstairs that had to my dog went
to make some breakfast I had scrambled
eggs and I put them in corn tortillas
with a little bit of cheese and it's so
good so take my pan out I spray it with
a little bit of like this olive oil
spray so it doesn't stick and then I
like to crack an egg I'm going to like
really walk you through this and then I
like to crack another egg
but with the other egg I don't put the
yolk that was oh and I just put like the
egg white part in if you want to mean
and um I stir it all up sorry if you're
vegan you probably hate me right now but
then I just put it in a pan and then
make some scrambled eggs and I tried
filming all this but it was a little bit
hard to get all these ankles obviously
and so after I'm done cooking my eggs I
then just put them on plate and got some
corn tortillas and cheese even though
you already knew that was coming this
just tastes really good I'm obsessive
taco so this is kind of like a breakfast
version of a taco I like to heat up my
tortillas usually I do this in a pan but
I don't know I was just feeling kind of
crazy I did it just on the stove almost
burned myself don't recommend this don't
do this but I then just heat them up put
a little bit of egg a little bit of the
cheese and we're good to go
I usually like a breakfast with like my
sister or something oh I also go to
water but no one was home because it
will everyone was home it was just early
in the morning so it's eating by myself
kind of sad but it's okay uh-huh
so I just ate my breakfast and then go
through social media usually when I like
like to sit down and have a moment to
just like look through social media I
love going to my tagged photos and
looking at
the cute fan pages and all the cute
edits and everything like that
so I'll just go through and like some of
those I'll go on Twitter favorite some
of your guys's tweets that I like all of
that and then after I end up with that I
like to throw some sort of breakfast bar
or some sort of bar in my purse because
as I said I was working so it's going to
be a long day this was funny I was
trying to figure out a thumbnail I just
thought you guys could see like the
struggle um I just grabbed my bags and
then I head out the door and that's it
so thank you for watching and love you
guys don't forget to Like comment and
subscribe and I'll see you guys next
time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
