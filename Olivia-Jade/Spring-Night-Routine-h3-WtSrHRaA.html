my channel today I'm filming my spring
night routine it so first I get home and
then I let my puppy at but actually
she's a dog mash and I'm really puppy I
love my dog out Bianca and we play fetch
for a little while probably like 15
minutes
ever since daylight savings and some are
starting to roll around and the
weather's changing she can't not play
fetch she always needs to anyway after
she's bored playing fetch with me it's
always her being bored with me I'm never
bored with her anyway I grab a glass and
I put some ice in it and then I also
give a piece of ice to Bianca because
she doesn't really like human food but
she loves ice and she eats a really
weird as you can see well she does
really eat it she's kind of special then
I fill up my glass of water with I mean
I fill up my glass with some water I
can't speak English and then I walk up
to my room and I put my phone on the
charger and I put some sweatpants on
because I didn't probably have much to
do that day I don't know I just put
comfy clothes on usually and then I put
my other clothing in the hamper and I go
out to my desk which is outside my room
and I reply to some YouTube comments
which you guys leave me which I love and
oh they're so sweet anyway so I reply to
as many as I can before I either eat
dinner or go out for dinner or just have
dinner and I also besides just replying
to comments even though this is what I
like doing most because your feedback
and everything's super awesome but I
also reply to some emails and edit of
video this video is coming soon clue
it's disgusting that's all I'm saying
I then went out to dinner I just didn't
film it and I came back and I'm now
doing my skincare routine so I'm
starting out by using my Garnier
micellar cleansing water on a cotton pad
and this just removes all your makeup I
got it off of Amazon and I prefer this
than any other makeup remover wipe and
then I take a q-tip and I remove all the
mascara and eyeliner with the same
product but just on a q-tip and it kind
of is easier for me I guess it works
better just because it's more precise
and then I use my lancer skincare polish
which is just an exfoliating scrub which
kind of feels like sand or
something very grainy on your face if
you have really sensitive skin this kind
of hurts it cuz it's just really rough
so I don't know about you but I'm
feeling 22 I'm kidding oh that was so
lame anyway my voiceover is doing so
well until I said that oh kind of anyway
I then used my Lancer skincare
whatchamacallit I don't even know what
this is called cleansing cleanse I don't
know I just rubbed my face with that
because that's what they told me to do
so
I'm doing it oh warning don't get it in
your eye it hurts as you can see at that
part I kind of felt like the kid from
home alone when he puts aftershave on
his face and he screams in the mirror I
love that movie anyway so then I turn on
my shower and I am not washing my hair
because I wash it using the morning
sheering spring and then I put my
pajamas on and I brush my teeth with
some toothpaste obviously I use the
crest whitening on 3d I don't really
know I then used my Lancer moisturizer
skin things moisturizer and I rub it
into my face obviously or you can leave
it whatever you prefer I then use some
eye cream and I'm using the Kiehl's
avocado eye treatment and then I use my
desert essence blemish stick which was
just recently my favorites video I think
and then I'm brushing my hair out
because after that whole day it is
disgustingly naughty and then I just put
it in a ponytail so it's a little bit
easier to tame the next morning and if
you have long and thick hair I feel you
out there girl or guy I don't know it's
just such a struggle anyway I just put
some chapstick on to finish off my
skincare routine and then I go in my bed
for like two hours and I just go to
sleep after I am on my computer for so
long and then yeah that's it thank you
guys all so much for watching all my
social media is right here as you can
see if you want to follow me and I will
see you next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
