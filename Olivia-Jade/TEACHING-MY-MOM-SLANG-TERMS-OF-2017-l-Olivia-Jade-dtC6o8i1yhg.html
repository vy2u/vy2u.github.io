because it's so good no but you can see
we're not in my generation okay we're

thought th ou t th ot thought I knew
this one but I don't wait to them it's
like oh she's a thought - oh she's a
thought and after thought oh no not th
ot - hot
okay I'm a milk I lift it up on urban
dictionary so I gave you like the best
definition without offending anyone oh
dear
okay a woman who pretends to be the type
of valuable female commodity who
rightfully earns a male commitment until
the man discovers that she's just a
cheap imitation of a good girl who is
only good for mindless sex not
relationships or respect but I'm not a
thought let's hope not not amaze me you
really don't know oh my gosh yeah it's
kind of like I thought I did a better
job yeah yeah you and your puns mom
they're nice whoppers I really don't
want you to hang out with any of those
thoughts by the way ladies don't be a
thought it's not it's not advisable
mm-hmm
Aunt Becky told you first you gotta get
some mom advice out there I meant was
I'm gonna say you have to if you want
respect you have to demand respect
so that's it bottom line and if somebody
doesn't respect you
then they're not worth your time that
and that's really true that is very true

that pizzazz no definitely not
