morning and I'm working today so I
thought I would vlog it because you guys
really seemed to like like the workday
folks even though my type of work is
very different from that average human
that actually has like hours my work is
not like scheduled it just has a good
general time today I'm doing a shoot
with this app and with a bunch of my
friends I think are gonna be there so I
guess we're gonna see it and just find
out when I get there but the drivers
outside I really love doing work shades
like this because it kind of pushes me
to be out of my comfort zone like I
normally really would prefer or love to
have like my agent with me or a manager
or someone just to like hang with me and
come with me into the shoot since I'm
going alone and like even though I know
people that'll be there it's just like I
don't like like walking in alone and
like I'm super awkward like that fun
fact now that I've done this a few times
like I feel a lot more comfortable
because I'm like used to doing stuff by
myself if that makes any sense so yeah
we're gonna go I don't know how much
I'll walk today I'm just gonna try my
best but this is a start to a weekly
vlog so you guys enjoy

youtubers are hot but I don't have a
crush on them if you end a hide a body
who would you call to help you and don't
pretend it's Bella cuz you know I'd do a
better job okay I choose camera
what comment is one that you hate
getting on your videos that something
about my mom anything about my mom and
everyone loves Lauri yeah but that's why
they have to tell me that over and over
again
we like Lauri better than you okay I
know carry on
James asks would you ever date a normal
guy like a non-celebrity guy if so this
is me shooting my shot well James you
missed the target James yeah I don't
care if you love it or not but like
James I don't know if I'm gonna date you
per say here's a good one what's the big
idea you've kept from your parents okay
so this one's actually I have one so
shout out to my parents if you're
watching this um the biggest secret I've
ever kept from my parents was when I was
16 and I first started going out with my
boyfriend I'm gonna was like my new
boyfriend and he lived in Santa Barbara
so I wasn't allowed to go to Santa
Barbara but you're gonna oh my god um I
don't think we'll do anything now but
they were out of town and so I snuck to
Santa Barbara told them I was sitting at
one of my friend's house it wasn't
anything like nothing like was going
down in Santa Barbara that like I really
needed to be there I just like really
wanted to meet his family and stuff they
still don't know one person who would
you bring my sister and then one if you
would tie like two days later yeah fella
would kill me so fast if you got
pregnant right now what would you name
your kid most rude youtuber social media
influence you've ever met and you don't
have to name names just describe the
situation okay one time I was at an
event and it was like a beauty launch
party and it was like one of the
just give a little clue it's like one of
the guys in the beauty world but there's
a very little man that's like one of
three people so oh no there's more than
that I saw him at a beauty launch party
and he was walking by and like all his
friends were talking to me and they were
all very nice and like introducing
themselves and whatnot but he like was
just kind of standing outside of the
group and was kind of weird it was like
usually those situations like maybe you
walk up to the person and be like oh by
the way I'm blah blah blah but maybe he
was just like socially awkward or
something so cuz sometimes I don't
always like going socialize - just cuz
I'm like an awkward person at first but
then I was just like standing there at
the event later on like talking with a
few friends I mean like walked by all of
us like super fierce and like hit me
with his purse when he was walking by I
don't know it just rubbed me the wrong
way I just thought he was kind of a brat
but maybe he was just having an off day
or maybe he's just an asshole I'll never
really know what's the one thing that
annoys you most about Bella that she's
so goddamn pretty and doesn't know it
what's your biggest guilty pleasure um
eating Cheetos was something you haven't
told us three months pregnant yep are
you tired of the full house related
questions yeah I am darling well I'm not
tired of them cuz obviously I don't care
like I love my mom and stuff but just
when it's the same question can you
twerk no then I'm not even gonna track
if you could be any animal what would it
be
frog what - we're here
you're weird if you ever snuck and do a
movie theater know you oh yeah I
actually have in Aspen remember I've
definitely gone into a different movie
than I originally planned to go to I
don't think I've ever like straight up
it's not candy a new movie theater
you're crazy
dear no at what point were you
comfortable wearing low-cut shirts
low-cut shirts I've always been
comfortable I was two years old wearing
deep v-neck
came out the womb I just still don't
really like wearing low-cut t-shirt I
don't think of flattering but I like
low-cut body suits
