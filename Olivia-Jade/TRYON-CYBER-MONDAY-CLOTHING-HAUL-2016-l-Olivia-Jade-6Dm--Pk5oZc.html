hope you're having a wonderful Sunday
today I am filming finally my
long-awaited Cyber Monday clothing haul
all the stuff came like two days ago and
yesterday the last package from Asus
came yesterday and I actually got like a
little like a la stuff but only from two
places I only shop to ASOS and then
PacSun which is where I did the real
damage because I guess their sins were
really good so if you guys wanna see
yeah everything I got just keep watching
if you aren't subscribed you can if you
want and let's get started okay I'm
going to start with Asus because I
didn't get that much from there I'm
gonna start with these shoes that I got
there just by ASOS and they're just
little white sneakers I think the reason
about them is because they have a little
peach back I don't know what's called
little backing and it's just a cute
little detail on it but these would be
really cute for the summertime because
it has like a little pop of color so
that's the first thing the second thing
I got is another pair of shoes and these
are also ASOS is the brand but these are
just really different they have again
like a little rose gold like metallic
back and then they're just like a cream
color and then it has a little platform
on it and these are going to be perfect
for the summer time I know we're in the
winter but they were on sale and they're
just really cool so I like them so I got
them when I was little I would wear
Juicy Couture's tracksuits all the time
and then I saw on ASOS they have Juicy
Couture track suits so I got this gray
one so if you don't know what track suit
is it's basically just like this velour
matching sweatshirt and bottoms but
doesn't this remind you like the mom in
Mean Girls so this might be the most me
thing ever um it's this mock neck log
sleeve just shirt and it's just navy
blue and then white side stripes and I
know I have so many things like this I
don't know why like wanting
and the male's like I need to stop
ordering the exact same thing because I
have smother just like this I like three
sweaters like this so in a shirt so I
need a chill but I love it I just I know
I'm gonna wear it a lot of gay that's
everything from ASOS that was super
super quick and passed on I actually
placed two orders so I placed one on
Black Friday and they had good sales on
the Cyber Monday they had really good
sales so I am just going to show you
those and I just combine it into one
order since it's all accent first thing
I got is this blue sweater I wore this
in like how to get the perfect messy bun
tutorial and everyone was asking where
it's from I've worn this so much since I
got it I couldn't wait till the hall so
I've worn this a couple times already
and it just fits really well it's super
cute did I stay in it why does it look
good there's a stain in the camera it's
a perfect color I'm obsessed with this
blue um for the season these chunky
sweaters I love this one okay so next I
got this pink I don't know it's just a
sweater little v-neck light pink like a
muted pink sweater and it's just really
comfortable I thought this would look
cute with just leggings and sneakers if
you're just like basic girl
this next sweater I really like um I
think it's just kind of different so I'm
into it oh I already got foundation on
it when I was trying it on for the try
on okay me on do this for you
okay so oh I guess it's from the Kendall
+ Kylie collection I didn't know that um
okay so it's just this sweater in a hat
sir from color blocking it goes from
blue to navy blue and then this tan and
it's mom connect and you guys know I
love them walk neck well it's really
really comfortable too just thought I'd
throw that out there okay so next I got
this little gray pack set or it's from
actually the brand I guess it's cold
what me to leave home it's just this
really soft Oh facts and stuff is really
soft that soft that I ordered off of it
but it's just this turtleneck little
right top another little top I got is
this gray long-sleeve it's also from
needle II and it's really soft this is a
little bit tighter I got this in an
extra small and it's just it's not high
rise or anything it's just a normal crew
neck a long-sleeve t-shirt but it's
tight and like a little bit thicker so
it definitely will keep you it will
definitely keep you warm like the
material oh I really love this sweater
okay so this sweater I'll see a little
bit better in the Tryon part I guess
this is also from the Kendall + Kylie
collection which I did not know that um
it's just this gray sweater and then it
has kind of a like this called like a
cowl neck I don't know it's just like a
looser kind of fitted turtleneck and
it's so soft like you don't understand
how cozy this is like you could just
sleep in this big so soft okay this is
not winter appropriate but I really
wanted this banty because out of said I
really like blue actually did actually
that I think I told you that what that
sweater
this blue Guns and Roses empty and I saw
Guns N'Roses at Coachella and they were
so good it was so good so um yeah I just
got this man T's super simple panties
aren't even flattering like I don't know
why I ordered so many because they
literally are not cute they don't know
they are cute but they're not cute
because they don't like flattery they
don't have any shape it's lighter just
like a huge t-shirt okay I got these
black jeans which fit really well these
are from well this is from Patton I got
these in a size 25 if you are wondering
they're just black skinny jeans and they
fit really well I'll show you the try on
portion but they're really really soft
and comfortable and they just like hug
your body nicely oh yeah okay
I love these they're these boyfriend
jeans from PacSun like actual Brandes
packs em and they're just like who wash
I guess they're just kind of like
distressed and they cup at the end so
the deal Paxson was having by the way
for their jeans was by one
the other one free so this these these
are free um they're just like
high-waisted mom jeans with like
different color blocking on them and
they're like striped and stuff with like
frayed edges and then the back is this
like dark wash I don't know about
everything I went through that really
fast yeah okay well that's everything I
got so I hope you enjoyed this Cyber
Monday clothing haul of course I'm not
trying to brag because some people try
and leave those comments and I'm like no

for that so I'm going to go now I need
