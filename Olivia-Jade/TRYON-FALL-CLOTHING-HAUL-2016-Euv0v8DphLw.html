hope you guys are having a great Sunday
or whenever you end up watching this um
today I'm filming a ball what am I
saying
I'm filming a fall clothing haul and we
do try on so you can see what all of
these pieces look like on I've
definitely done bigger hauls on my
channel before I thought I was
collecting a lot more than I actually
ended up collecting but don't get me
wrong I still did get a lot of stuff
just in my head I thought I got like an
unreasonable amount of stuff and
although I did get a lot of clothes it
wasn't like an insane amount maybe it
was we're gonna find out so if you guys
aren't subscribed um it would make me
really excited and happy if you would
subscribe obviously you can join our
squad but oh my god did I say squad
alright let's get started stuff first
place I'm gonna start with is Zara
because I got three things from Zara two
of the three things are shoes because
you know I love fall boots and like
little booties these first boots are my
all-time favorite things verities but
you can see what they're they're just
black boots but they're just really cute
like black healed I have two of them
don't worry
um boots and I love them a lot I think
they're going to be really cute to wear
with like jeans and an oversized sweater
or really anything they're just really
versatile since they're just plain black
next I got these really cute boots from
Zara
and these might be my all-time favorite
shoes I own they're just like this um
which we call it velvet and then they
have it's really really pretty gold
zipper and the heel and everything is
just sort of perfect about these I could
not love these more so I was so excited
when I saw them and they were $39 cuz I
look so ugly today I just don't just
don't buy with whatever's happening I
also got this really cute um beige
sweater from Zara and it's just like a
v-neck and I thought this would look
really really cute with like layered
chokers and then like a vintage
boyfriend jeans and then
um we've been to trial I stood one and
then just some cute sneakers or boots or
anything like that but I love this and
it's just kind of like no it's not
oversized it kind of fits perfectly in
my opinion I wore last night I love it
that is everything from Zara I just got
three things and then I'm going to move
on to redone I don't know if you guys
know what redone is but it's a jean
company and they basically just like
take old Levi's jeans and then patch
them together that I've been worn so
they're really expensive um
jeans and you guys know I like to show
portable things but I have a really hard
time finding good jeans for me that are
affordable if you guys have any good
places please let me know down below um
so I just got some nice pairs so these
are the first ones and you can see what
they look like better on the Tryon
portion but they're just they button all
the way up and then they're high-waisted
and then they just go all the way down
they're really plain basic this is the
back looks like I also got another pair
and I thought these ones are really cool
because they don't have a waist line if
that makes any sense
so they just go down and I cut them at
the bottom and I think these are so cute
I'm so excited to wear these I am now
moving on to urban I got this really
really cute jacket that I've just kind
of been obsessed with wearing it's so
cute and I'll show it awesome like I
don't even know how to describe it it's
just like this tan you can totally see
what it is but it's just so cute and
it's just really comfortable and you'll
be able to see kind of what it looks
like um more clearly in the Tryon
portion but I love it um I have two more
things from Urban Outfitters and the
first ones are these jeans see no other
jeans fit me besides read on at this
point these ones were huge I'm usually a
size 25 but I think I might be a 24 in
these there's a mom high-rise jeans and
they're from the BDG collection that's
what those look like I need to get them
hemmed lastly from Urban is just like it
looked really cute on the website and
then when I got it I didn't know how I
felt about it and I when I put it on it
actually did not look that bad so it's
just like this little sweater situation
so are you gonna hear my mom my sister
they're talking but
like they live here so I can't tell them
to be quiet and then last night I went
with brandy melville I really thought I
got way more stuff in this there
honestly I'll probably be doing a lot
more fall shopping so if you know me I
love carrying around little backpacks
instead of purses I think backpacks are
so cute and I saw this on their website
and it was $38 I just thought it's
really sturdy actually and you just push
it open and then it opens and it has
newspaper because I haven't used it and
I want to keep it in shape but it is
really really cute and I think it just a
plain little black backpack so you can
just put this on with like a cute
sweater and vintage jeans and like those
black star boots and that would be a
really cute outfit so yeah I love this
and I just got a couple sweaters and
then that completes this whole I don't
know I I really felt like I got so much
more but I guess I did oh wait I got one
more thing for me hold on it gotten so
confused I can't tell I don't know these
are the one from Brandi aren't they yeah
there we go so I got these brand new
mobile jeans and they were $40 and they
haven't tried them on so we'll see how
they fit but they're just this really
cute blue we're really cute blue it
shows denim and then it has like a white
patch on one of the legs and then it has
like a different denim pasture on the
other so you'll be able to see it a lot
more clearly in the Tryon portion but I
think those jeans are really cute and
I'm excited to wear them because I love
kind of like patched jeans like that
okay so next I have this sweater and
this from brandy melville obviously all
the rest of this is from brainy brainy
brandy um but it's just like this really
cute navy blue sweater with white
stripes and it's really cozy and
everybody knows I'm obsessed with
stripes I've been obsessed with stripes
since I first started making my youtube
videos so everybody always used to ask
me why I always wore so many stripes and
it's literally because that's all I used
wrong I'll start from brandy melville I
got like this little high rise neck um
just sweater and it's super oversized
and comfortable and I love it's not a
full turtleneck what are these called
like a cowl neck or whatever mom Oh what
are these called cowl necks cow cow cow
cow
that's not a kalmyk kalmyk hangs low
that's like uh could be like a mock
turtle my mom nag Pat's with her yeah
it's a mock neck and then two more
things from brandy um my favorite
another stripe shirt what do you know
but I
oh my god is over stain on it stained I
need to get that out just the messy life
of me it's just this really cute striped
white um situation whatever and then it
has a little bit of a high neck but not
really I know where this into you know
and everybody was asking me where I got
it and it's from any mobile and I love
it love it it might be my favorite shirt
ever and lastly to close out this hall I
just got this really cute turtleneck
sweater from Brandi and once again I
just think it's really cozy and cute and
I love that too
so you guys will get to see everything
in the Tryon portion but thank you so
