today's video as you can tell this kind
of ammonia-free
I am doing a spring clothing haul this
will not be the last spring clothing
haul I love shopping kind of problem but
like also science and I also love doing
calls this has been so requested and yes
it will be a try on haul as you can also
tell by the title so with that being
said I hope you guys enjoy it subscribe
if you aren't already give this video a
thumbs up if you liked it and yeah let's
get started and if you enjoy I'm going
to start with shop off I just got three
pairs of 1tsp jean shorts they're
literally my favorite shorts they do run
a little bit big yeah big sorry so like
I'm normally a size 25 in jeans and then
I'm a 24 or 23 in the shorts so just
keep that in mind if you decide to buy
some these are a little bit more
expensive I guess for jean shorts but
they are really good quality and they're
really the only ones that fit me so
that's why I really like them I got
three pairs but I can only find two of
them and all these are the first pair
about them in a size 24 they're so cute
they look really good on their
slaughtering the butt is or like the box
of the shorts is a little bit longer so
it does cover your butt and the front
goes up a little bit so if you let it
kind of cutting off your legs a little
bit which I personally do they're really
really great I also just go up a lighter
wash pair which I haven't tried on yet
but I think they're also really cool
just to change it up I got another
medium washed pair that I can't find
right now so that's everything I got
from shop off and then I'm going to go
on to brandy Melville I'm going to start
with something that's not super spring
just to get out of the way wet it's just
a nice big jacket it has like for like
six of these four lines on the inside of
it has a little collar and then it's
just like this kind of easy bomber style
it is a little bit thicker so this would
be good if you are in a colder climate
I've got some now I love this jacket I
think it's going to look great on a cold
day in the summer
that's I'm bringing my little I got this
a little gray shirt I'm honestly always
in need of just little t-shirts like
this so I got one in gray and I also got
the exact same style and white I think
this will just look really cool with
like like high-waisted shorts and then I
have this cool H felt I might where is
it I also got two of these cut the tops
which this was in my get ready with me
video it was a really quick video I'm
sorry about that but um this was a part
of the outfit and I think this shirt is
so cute the only thing is if you have
for me personally I think if you have
boobs it looks kind of weird I feel like
if you had smaller boobs would look
cuter I don't know why cuz I have a
bigger chest or whatever and I think it
looks strange what you can decide that
in the Tryon portion and I also got the
same style in this red like red and blue
checkered and it has a little bow I
think it is so really cute when it's
going to be great for summertime and it
is super comfortable
it's flattering I just feel like it
doesn't look I but also you always want
what you can't have isn't by food they
don't want these because I think
clothing looks better without boobs
thanks from brandy melville it's just
this cute little tank it's really
stretchy it literally looks like it
could fit a four-year-old but it does
stretch and then it just has two little
truck this little is great with your
shorts or even kind of mini skirts but
how to be like a cool mini skirt you
call it a black mate skirt and do like
an all-black outfit with a bandanna and
something that'd be kinda cool I also
got this off the shoulder top and from
Randy honestly it's really cute but I do
feel like all the shoulder tops are
sometimes kind of hard to wear because
they just fling up boy I can never find
the right bra to go with it so I need to
get more strapless bras and like stick
on brows but once I get that or just
this over bathing suit like if you're
shops like baby food shops or start
showing through it wow I can't read it
also from Brandi I love this little tank
just because it just reminds me
like good vibes it just is a rainbow
it's just a rainbow colored shirt and
there's not really much to it great for
summer super light table next I've seen
this shirt okay well actually didn't
know this shirt was really popular until
my sister was like anyone how much shirt
so it's just this see-through like
sparkling kind of long-sleeve shirt and
then it has that little pattern I don't
really know what this is called scaffold
scaffold
I don't really know around the net and
I'm going to show you a package from
Urban Outfitters optimists and I got a
really cute bra that's what I think was
looks good under this so when the time
comes I'll show you
and lastly for clothing from brandy
melville I think everyone needs a white
long-sleeved shirt and their closet and
I didn't have one so I just haven't got
a plain white long-sleeve shirt and I
think we're just as cute tucked in for
like mom jeans I also got a couple rings
from brandy I don't know why I just got
this little silver one right here I
think it's kind of cute and then I got
this kind of different silver one I
don't know why because I only wear gold
and rose gold jewelry but I guess maybe
one day when I want to start wearing
four doors class two rings there were
like five dollars in three dollars so
it's really very inexpensive okay so now
on to urban Urban Outfitters home I
first thought okay so this is like a
cute little beach cover-up it's just
this was it a romper oh it's short oh I
kind of columns giraffes like a mini
dress a little blue it looks cute is
just a black off the shoulder and that
material it's like super stretchy and
then it's really sheared towards the
bottom here is the bralette I was
talking about that would look kind of
cute under
the see-through shirt it's just this
like holographic wow this is like way
thinner than I saw like this how we no
support or anything but the strap can
tighten which is so important because I
often find myself like it will fit
sometimes like my actual boob but then
the chocolate is big falling off so Anna
also this shirt kind of like grabbed my
attention
it's kind of weird right why did they
send me two of the same Birol boy
accidentally ordered two which are going
to grab my attention I thought it was
rude cute for summertime with jeans or
with like boyfriend jeans or with two
Shores it's coming like the tank and
then it's muffled and it's pretty and
yeah stimulated summer vibes so I got it
Oh
this shirt is just really tight off the
show off the shoulder like milk there's
not even arm sirs it's now shoulder just
like a bando kind of shirt chocolates
the coach-office javis little men doze
off okay so next so next is this okay I
mess up of this it's this like little
colored kind of like linen material um
kind of each cloth material if you know
what I mean and it's just like a little
shirt and then it goes high in the front
and really low in the back this would
look so cute with shorts so next I got
this shirt I don't know how this is
going to look on it's definitely one of
those types of shirts I just have to try
but it is really cool I've been really
into weird sweeps lately so this is kind
of crazy and I'm just excited I think
this looks really cute with my boyfriend
jeans like cropped when you're nice and
tan and so and just like white like
white bands these are these ghosts like
round purple sunglasses I just need two
cheap sunglasses like for Coachella and
stuff oh my god I'm stuck you can see my
ring light in them but
they're cool they make the room look
like blue purple tint I also got this
really cute shirt okay so the pattern at
first was a little weird to me I dunno I
don't really go with a pattern stuff but
it's really cool like it it looks so
we're never I feel like on the model it
looked good so hopefully when I tried on
a little cute it's like cropped down
like long sleeves and lastly just to
finish off this spring haul I ordered a
huge sweater because when I see big
sweaters you guys know my obsession
I just can't know I know this isn't
spring what if it's cold one night and
then I can bring out the big white knit
turtleneck I thought also the way softer
I'm not going to live it but it's still
to you so that is going to be it for my
spring summer in true summer currently
spring it clothing home well I guess for
a lot of you if you would kind of colder
