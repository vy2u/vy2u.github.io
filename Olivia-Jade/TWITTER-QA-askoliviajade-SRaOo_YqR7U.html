filming a question-and-answer I'm sorry
how I sound - I'm really sick right now
and I feel so bad so I asked you guys on
Twitter to ask me questions that you
guys want to know and I said I would
answer them so that's what I'm going to
do so I'm just going to go through my
favourites and answer them okay first
question is by Becca Hines and it says
what is your favorite mascara well
recently I tried out the Too Faced
better than sex mascara which is such a
weird name I don't know why they would
name it that but and it is so good I'm
obsessed with it I also like the Tarte
like camera lashes mascara what app do
you use for white orders on insta um I
use this app called after light I'll
show you guys it forward it looks like
this and basically like you just upload
a photo and let's say okay I'm uploading
this one back of Rocky cuz it's on my
phone but at the end right there you can
click and then it gives you like a bunch
of different options to do and then you
can choose a white border and stuff like
that how much you want it to be like
bordered it also lets you do like a
bunch of different effects and editing
and like saturating it's like the only
app I use to edit photos and stuff so
you were watching nine oh two one oh
where are you now um how you know I was
watching nine at una you haven't seen it
just mute your volume really quickly so
I can just talk to the people that have
watched it so they can understand my
shock but I want to spoil it for you so
just like mute the volume really quickly
okay go okay so I was like freaking out
at the part when my mom was dating
Matthews because I was like what just
happened and I don't even know and then
there's that point that not even going
to get into it and I'm in season five I
just started season five so I'm on like
episode two I'm almost done and I'm
really sad
Ashley Spears asked what is your dream
vacation um I don't know
used to be Africa but that wouldn't be a
good idea right now
probably like Bora Bora I think I'd be
incredible like be so cool I'm just like
yes I really want to go to Bora Bora
just because I want to stay in one of
those huts on the water and just take
such cool photos and like have the best
time and go scuba diving and everything
like that what's your favorite and least
favorite subject at school um my
favorite subject at school would
probably be hmm probably like science I
think it's fun I have my best friend
rocky in my class so it's like party I
loved math like for the past two years
because I have the best teacher in the
whole entire world and my least favorite
is what I'm afraid my teachers are gonna
one day see my videos and see that I
don't like their class history has just
never been like my favorite I always
found it a little bit like that's not
because the people or anything in it and
it's not because my teacher doesn't
teach me a good way I don't know so
probably history's my least favorite my
favorite either like math science or
Spanish or something like that has your
mom taught you any beauty tips that you
really love um well not really no she
wasn't really taught meaning beauty
tricks I remember when I was little I
would always go into her bathroom and
open all the drawers up and I just see
like jars filled with makeup and I was
like so infatuated by it I thought it
was like the coolest thing ever to have
makeup and ever since then I've just
been like really interested in makeup so
but just really taught me any like
tricks chance Washburn asked asked

super obsessed with Gossip Girl
a long time ago but I ever like watched
that in a while because it's been over
