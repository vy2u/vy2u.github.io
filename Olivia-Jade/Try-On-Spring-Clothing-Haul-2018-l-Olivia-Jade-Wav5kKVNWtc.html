channel if you're new here what's up i'm
olivia jade you should hit that
subscribe button
umm today I am doing a clothing haul
it's a try on clothing haul it's been
such a hot minute since I've done a
clothing haul on my youtube channel and
I've picked up a ton of new pieces for
the spring and summer time since the
weather is finally starting to change in
LA so yeah I just thought I'd show you
guys what I got and I really hope you
all I'm joking also I'm sorry for my
background my whole room is basically a
mess but this is what I'm working with
so I'm gonna start with two things that
are a little bit random cuz the rest I
have like a bunch of stuff from
different brands but I just have this
little bag from this company called cozy
numbers I don't know if I'm pronouncing
it wrong but I just thought it was a
really cute little bucket bag and I
really liked it so that's the first
thing I got Fila
um sent me a pair of shoes and these
shoes are pretty popular I see them on
like Urban Outfitters and stuff and I
really wanted them but they were out of
stock and then when they emailed me I
got really excited but yeah they're just
really cute white platform sneakers they
kind of remind me of the new I think it
was Valenti agha but the Balenciaga ones
are sold out everywhere these are like
pretty close I think they're super cute
and I'm excited to wear them then the
new crazy here next I am going to show
you some stuff I got from Tiger mist I
only got two things but the first thing
is this jumpsuit this is so cute on I
didn't really expect it to fit because
jumpsuits never fit me and this one is
really cute let me show you please hold
but it goes like this and then it goes
down in to pants and it's all red and
it's I think flattering I like the
cutouts and I like how it kind of just
like sucks you all in I think it's
really cute so I'm very excited about
that and then they also sent over this
little matching set so it's this pair of
plaid pants and this little matching
wrap top which you will also see in the
Tryon okay let's jump into the stuff I
got from forever 21 I only got a few
pieces and I won't keep it too long so I
don't want to bore any of you guys but
I'm
the pieces that I found there and also I
showed it in my last vlog so if you
already saw that vlog you already know
what's up but you can see what they look
like on at least in this video so I'm
gonna start with this jacket it is the
school jacket I know it's not for
everyone
and some people are gonna think this is
the ugliest thing ever I think it's
really cool and it's inspired by it an
ACME jacket so it is a lot more
affordable and yeah I just think it's
really baggy and cute and I really like
it I also got it in this metallic well
it's actually completely different but
another jacket kind of similar it has
like this fake kind of like shearling
material and then like obviously fake
leather um and yeah that's really cute
so yeah I'm in such a weird mood I'm
also really hungry so I'm sorry if I
seem dead in this video I love you guys
so much honestly also I just feel like
kind of a mess right now so if I'm a
little bit off it has nothing to do with
YouTube where you guys I'm trying to
push through but I like so much on my
mind that ah it's hard but you know I'm
a normal girl so it happens the next
thing I got is this shirt I have no idea
how I'm gonna style this yet and I don't
even know if I really like it it's like
something I would never ever ever buy I
kind of like I don't know something like
spoke to me before I ordered it I don't
know how to put it I think this might be
the ugliest thing I've ever purchased if
I like tie it see but now my arms are
like weirdly caught I don't know I don't
know okay you know what in a try on
maybe I'll figure out how to make it
cute okay now we are going on to the
stuff I got from princess Polly one of
my favorite websites on the planet and
you guys can use my code Olivia Polly
for 20% off I'll have my code right here
I got a lot sorry
driving it all in so let's start with
this pair of shoes so this pair shoes
are this parachute is these pairs of
shoes this pair of shoes is pair of
shoes money on that education yeah
that's right this pair of shoes um I see
it still sounds right I'm not guys ain't
forget it I got these black boots that
works um they are really cute and shiny
and
I like them they're kind of like that
like patent leather vibe I think they're
super sleek this with like redone jeans
and like a cute crop would be adorable
it's very like model off-duty and then
this little t-shirt I don't know I am in
need of just basics like literally just
basic stuff like this and with jeans or
shorts or whatever so like this little
white tank top kind of has like this
little scalloped detail what else oh I
also got that same shirt in black so
cute I mean it's just very easy to match
anything with those types of things so I
feel like when I can find those types of
basic pieces I like to like stock up on
them
these pants are dope they are from
princess Polly but they're by the brand
IMG F you guys know I love I am Gia I
have a bunch of stuff from them as well
that they sent over that I'm very
excited to share with you guys
these pants are just white and they're
baggy and cool and I like like the thick
little belt and it's kind of like a seat
belt buckle which i think is kind of
funny like a car seat so I want yeah
it's like a car seat and they're just
like these big oversized white kind of
like boyfriend baggy pants super cute
and really great for the summer even
that was like a bathing suit top yes I
also got this dress because I think it's
honestly just precious and I'm excited
to wear it it's just this white little
dress and it's kind of like mid length
it ties around your boobs and it's just
so cute I'm sorry I'm gonna find a new
word than cute one day it's just not
today okay next up is this dress I
actually have this dress in another
color and I'm obsessed with it and I
posted on my Instagram picture will be
right here so I got this same address I
just got it in a size bigger because I
feel like maybe if you have a little bit
of a chest you want you might want to
size up if you're normally I can extra
small me to get a small because the
buttons all my other just kind of pull a
little bit so I think this one is gonna
fit a lot better and the tight and the
straps are adjustable of which key I
don't know why everyone doesn't make
every strap adjustable
I was like even this shirt like it'd be
awesome if these were adjustable
it's a little big just saying put it out
there next is this top I think it's
really cool it is just this see-through
top I like these types of shirts for
layering or with a cool bralette
underneath it can be like that kind of
see-through by this shirt I think is
awesome because it is gonna look great
over a bathing suit like this open
tucked into a pair of denim shorts with
like some cute Birkenstocks or something
just for like a casual beach day I think
is such a cute look and it's just like
super oversized I wouldn't wear this
like buttoned up all the way with like
jeans and sneakers like that's not
really the vibe I'm going for but like
unbuttoned very beachy perfect for
spring and summer so I'm really excited
this dress I think is so precious and
I'm trying to collect as many little
summery dresses right now as I can
because it's the easiest thing to throw
along literally ever you just can chuck
it on pair of sneakers you're out the
door and you look somewhat presentable
so I thought this dress was super cute
it looked great on the model so
hopefully it looks good on me
um just ties around like right you're
gonna see in the Tryon hopefully it
looks through the trial I haven't tried
all these pieces on only some of them so
yeah it's just this long maxi dress I
think the pattern is so cute and girly
and I'm very excited to wear it again
I'm just trying to get new shirts
because I feel like I never have any
shirts even though I always shop where
do they go it's a mystery yeah this
one's so cute I think will be great for
summer for spring for winter for fall
whenever you want to wear it's just a
little shirt oh this talk I think is so
darling and it's gonna look awesome with
pair of jeans it's like this baby crop
it looks like it could be for a
four-year-old child but it's not it's
for an 18 year old independent woman
me I'm getting okay oh yeah I really
like wrap tops so I got this black
little wrap top just like my 400-million
wrap top so I could probably stop
ordering them now I'm just like that I
buy stuff I don't need but yeah I just
think this will be so cute my sister
just texted me she's coming home tonight
I'm so excited just at college so this
is really exciting I mean I saw
yesterday but like I was feeling really
upset and empty today because I love her
oh yay okay that made my whole day
better okay
this dress I literally have no idea
where it's from I it was mixed in my
pile between tiger mist and princess
Polly and then when I went on both our
websites to try and figure out where
this was from I couldn't find this dress
but it says on it designed in Australia
so I know it's tyre mr. princess Polly
the brand says hazel it looks more like
a tiger miss dress but very much could
be on princess Polly like I really don't
know but I thought it was super cute
it's just straight across dress and it
kind of gives me like very similar vibes
- are you oh my and there's just like
this black little mini dress I love
these pants pretty sure I got them all
princess Polly but they are just these
cute little beachy checkered they are so
lightweight that this is perfect to
chuck over a bathing suit and just run
around like an all-black bathing suit
you have these on with your black
triangle bikini top so cute I love it I
also picked up this little top it's kind
of similar to the one I'm wearing right
now actually but it's in red and I also
have this type of style top in black and
white pink and they're all friend
princess Polly and they're just so cute
to just tuck on with pair jeans so love
that this is a last knot from princess
Polly it's this oversized white jacket I
was actually leaving a nice one on this
and they think paparazzi took a photo in
it there it is well that was easy to
find trying to show you guys the image
it's like this really cute oversized
denim jacket I mean I guess you'll see
him to try on yeah I just thought it was
like really cute it's super easy like I
literally wore it with leggings and
sneakers and it was kind of everything
oh my god this art it's all just Jerrod
sorry now I'm just finding this this is
hilarious Bella's carrying like 1,200
different things okay and then the last
thing or the last place I shopped at was
I am Gia so I'm gonna show you guys
everything I got from there and you guys
know I'm a themed for IMG estra so get
ready they literally PM me and I
great I got so excited I texted a
screenshot to my sister and I was like
my dream just came true I can save money
by not spending all of it on ing and out
ok so let's start with these two tops
they gifted me the first one is this
little tube top and it's so cute perfect
with like all their pants because as you
even saw those white pants that I showed
you that were ing up pumping this
quality like this would be great with
that they also sent over this top which
is like the latex kind of banjo with
straps so love that so cute and then
these overalls I'm just like praying
they fit me because they're so cute this
would look awesome with a turtleneck
like a black turtleneck if it's cold or
like even something like this underneath
it but yeah they're just like these
little over and I think they're adorable
and they scrunch at the end and yeah I'm
very excited to try and style that I got
two pairs of pants I actually have these
in black or no in tan I have them in tan
so I was super excited I got them in
white and pink so I think this is
amazing for the spring and summer like
this color is gonna be perfect
and I just think it's since they're pink
pants I probably wouldn't have bought
them by myself because I never branch
out color but now that I have them
they're everything I ever needed and
more and I didn't even know it you know
what I mean and then also in white I
through the same thing and I love this
chain belt I think it's so fun my sister
actually wore my pants like this and out
to a party I think in college and she
would send me snapchats that she changed
herself to someone like some boys pants
that sounds weird like friendly friendly
very friendly but I was like if you
break my pants I'm going to kill you I'm
just kidding but ya know I love them
they're super cute I got this pair of
pants which are just so freakin cute and
sleek and sexy and really just black and
would go with everything but also like
so much better than your average black
pant and what I love about IMG F pants
like like all the ones I've just shown
you um you can get at things like
Alexander Wang and like Balenciaga and
really and like on Barney's and stuff in
it
essence and like all these really fancy
websites and brands that
just cost so much money and so I love
that these are around like eighty to a
hundred dollars because although that's
so expensive it's really really good
quality stuff and they look really cute
and high-end and it's not thousands and
thousands so I think it's great to share
with you guys and then you guys asked me
every single day where this jacket is
from because I wear it all the time
it's IMG I have it in red and now tain't
well I've always had an int and now I
have two in tan because I sent me
another one so I'm gonna give it to my
mom
I lost my black one and I'm like very
very very distraught about but I left it
at my friend's house and I'm on a
mission to find it cuz now it's like
sold out like what am I supposed to do
maybe it's back in stock now I don't
know but it's the coat that I wear
everywhere actually works so much that
someone finally looked at me at a party
was like do you just wear that coat
every time you go out like you're wrong
because the answer is yes so yeah that's
everything I got for this clothing haul
I hope you guys enjoyed it make sure to
give it a thumbs up if you did love you
guys so much I hope you know that and I
will see you guys on Friday peace out
what's up
I never say peace out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
