channel if you're new here my name is
Olivia Jade I post every single Tuesday
and Friday and today's video is another
clothing haul this one is kind of like a
perfect spring break clothing haul I'm
currently on break and I'm actually
about to leave for out of town in a few
days it's so a lot of the pieces that I
got are perfect for like more tropical
sunny weather I guess you could say but
yeah I just wanted to show you guys some
awesome pieces I picked out from boo
Hill this video is sponsored by the WHO
and all the pieces are from boohoo but I
got my hands on some really really cute
stuff everything is under $100 for the
most part or I think actually yeah I
think everything is under $100 so it's
an affordable haul I love the whoo their
quality is great so all the products I
talked about obviously will be linked
below in the description box and you
guys can also check down there for a
discount code which who doesn't love so
all these pieces are really fun they're
affordable they're on trend boo who has
thousands of new pieces dropping every
week on the website so it's always going
to be updated new things super cute they
kind of follow all the big trends so you
guys can definitely find some awesome
stuff on there I'm gonna start with the
codes I got because they aren't very
spring-like so I kind of want to get
them out of the way okay so the first
coat is this it's this really nice
oversize big black jacket it kind of has
like the faux fur feeling to it and it's
just super big and warm and comfortable
this is great if you're still in cold
weather obviously and it's just kind of
like a great staple to have it's just a
big black jacket and I really like it so
that's the first thing I also got this
jacket it's just a green bomber jacket
remember when these were super on trend
like last season I'm hoping that it kind
of never goes out of style because it's
so comfortable and big and then I got
this awesome
sweat suit so it's matching sweat pants
and a sweatshirt and it looks like this
and then across it it just says sweat
all down the pant and it cuffs like it
gets tighter at the end and
it comes with this really cute matching
cropped sweatshirt and then the sleeves
also say sweat I think yeah all around
what I like about this is you can throw
this on with sneakers and it's super
cute and looks like you kind of put a
little bit of effort since it matches or
you can throw it on with like some cool
like heels and kind of go for that like
sporty chic vibe if you like a meeting
or an interview or something I don't
know I think it's a lot I got this
little dress which i think is adorable I
haven't tried any of these pieces on so
we're gonna find out together but it
just looks like this and has these two
little straps and then it goes down it
kind of like rushes in the middle and
then it goes down to like a mid length
so we'll see I hope this is flattering
on because I think it's really cute I
got this shirt that says woman I my crop
exciting this would be a really cool
crop top and it is pretty long but I
just think this shirt is so fitting like
especially right now just like woman
power and being like a successful strong
independent woman is so important so I
really like the message of the shirt and
then also I like the color scheme of red
and white also the shirt I'm wearing is
from boohoo it's just a little wrap top
I think it's very cute
so another pair of sweatpants because if
you don't know I work from home so I'm
always in sweatpants when I'm filming um
so these ones are super cute and they're
really soft and they just go into a
little cuffed ankle just gray black
white super cute okay I got this
bodysuit I'm so excited to try this on
because the straps are so so thin I
think it's really cute it's just one of
those straight-across one's got this in
a size I think extra small nope it's a
size us two so we shall see so next up
is this mesh boohoo a little cover-up I
love this so much I love the hood I
think it's so great for a beach cover-up
even for like Coachella or something
this would be really cute and then this
piece is awesome so let me make sure I
have all the pieces so it comes with
this little top and it has these
matching shorts and then it has a
matching like head wrap and then it also
has a
watching like kimono cover-up jacket
thing that's like the perfect beach
outfit so I'm really excited okay so
next up is another little matching a
sweat suit which I really like at the
moment so it's this amazing like
periwinkle blue color and it's super
lightweight which I like so it looks
like this for the top and then the
bottom is where these really soft little
sweatpants but they're not like really
sweats like you could get away with this
and make them look fancy so oh I think
it's a great pairing again the sneakers
or with like boot heels super cute like
white like you know my off-white boots
it's a for walking or like the ankle
ones these pants are amazing they are
just this really fun red color and then
down the side it has this super chic
kind of detailing they unsnap so you can
get real scandalous with these love them
super cute
these pants are also really cute and I
just showed them to my grandma just like
they're so cute and I was like thanks
grandma but yeah they're just like these
little plaid pants and I think this with
the body suit would be adorable I don't
know they're just cute okay and I need
to find a new word and I say that every
single clothing haul dang it okay
another little beach cover-up I got two
that are very similar so this one is the
mid-length one and I also got kind of
like a maxi one but just really pretty
kind of gives me like nice ferry vibes
okay everyone needs a really cute
stapled stapled hmm it's good attempt
it's good attempt Liv everyone needs a
really cute little black crop top so
this one is from the who obviously and
it's really soft it feels really really
really really really really really
really really really really comfortable
really comfortable okay another wrap top
oh wait no JK this is rollin whoa am i
okay which other yet okay so this next
top is a bodysuit it's just a black
turtleneck bodysuit I have been in
desperate need for one of these for the
longest time just because it's such a
staple like basic piece in your wardrobe
so I think it's awesome to have this one
feels really high-quality and I know
that it is very affordable it doesn't
have a price on here but as I said who
has basically everything under
and then I also got this white rap top I
think this is so cute and it's gonna
look awesome in the spring summer just
when it's a little bit warmer out just
to tie it around super cute and then I
also got the same black wrap top as the
one I'm wearing in red right now and
it's super good quality like it feels
really thick and like it's gonna last me
a long time and also like it's super
secure when you tie it like I don't feel
like I'm gonna like fly out of place
when I'm wearing it I also got these
pair of shoes oh no not this again and
they are super cute they're like faux
suede and they're light blue and you
just they're just little baby heels and
I think this is adorable and easy to
slip on and very summery and then I also
got these slides because they are so fun
and they're just purple and white
obviously and they're super squishy and
comfortable and I always love a good
slide I actually don't know what I'm
gonna wear these with like besides an
all-black like workout outfit like quit
going to the nail salon go throwing some
slides I don't know how to actually make
these cute but I'm excited to try and
then I need to show you this set because
I think it's one of my favorite pieces I
hope it looks as cute on as it does off
so it's this pair it's these pair of
this pair of these pairs these pair so
it's these shorts and they're so cute
and they're actually pretty long for a
pair of shorts then it comes with a
matching blazer I mean so business chic
and cute I can't even either Red's not
my color short hair is not my thing
or I'm just having an off day and then I
also got this bodysuit that is a little
bit see-through
and it just looks like this it's like a
mock neck and again just a nice basic
piece to have in the wardrobe I also got
this Disney shirt and it's Mickey Mouse
and it's super oversized even though
it's a size small so maybe I want to go
in the medium and then worn it with like
boots like over the knee boots
I don't really know it's so cute I can't
wait to wear this and just figure out a
way to styler it without looking like a
little boy even though I'm kind of down
for that little boy look like I don't
hate it you know okay these pants also
approved by my grandmother she thinks
they're adorable so love you nanny
they are these pink plaid pants and they
just go down and they're so stretchy see
that and they just feel like super high
quality super great material absolutely
love them so killer they're gonna make
your butt look great because I can
already tell they have to fit where they
kind of like hug you so love it last two
things this is something you guys know I
probably would never go for because it
has a lot of stuff going on but I
actually really like it it's like this
long kimono
type cover-up I don't know I think it's
just gonna be super cute for like
running around the beach you can wear
your hair up and like messy wet vibes
with like no makeup or like really glowy
makeup but like minimal doesn't look
like my makeup and like some nice gold
hoops so cute and pretty so I'm very
excited about that
then lastly this is kind of like the
cover-up I showed earlier that was mid
length this one is just a maxi version
so I think it's really pretty and it
just goes all the way down to like this
beautiful dress it's gonna look amazing
again for just the beach summer time
again with your hair like you could even
do this with like wet hair really
slipped in a low bun this with like a
great little shoe
I don't know and like a cute bathing
suit under obviously I really like it
and I'm really excited to style it so
that is everything for this haul thank

see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
