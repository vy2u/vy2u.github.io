happy Sunday if you're not subscribed
you can hit this button here and be sure
to subscribe we were super close to 2000
2000 way over 2000 subscribers where
it's so close to 250,000 which is
mind-blowing to me I can't even believe
it totally just hit 200,000 so Idol
where you forty thousand other people
snuck up on me as you can tell by the
title of this video I am doing unboxing
my P o box boxes sounded weird
um so number one my P o box is not open
for my subscribers I only use my P o box
for PR packages and then you don't know
what that is that is basically mail from
companies I've been thinking about
opening my PA box for subscribers to
write me letters and stuff as of now I'm
just kind of keeping it for PR packages
and then maybe I'll open up a whole new
box or something for specifically
subscriber letters I don't really know
yet I got a call from my P o box and
they were like you have too many boxes
in your P o box you need to come and get
them so I just drove over there picked
up all these they're so heavy this one
this huge white one is so heavy I'm so
curious what's in here and um just
before I get into this I want to say
thank you to all the brands that have
sent me stuff you guys are so sweet and
I literally am so grateful for all the
stuff you guys are sending me i if
you're watching I don't know Pilar but I
couldn't thank you enough and enough of
me talking let's get in it two packages
and in no way am I trying to brag I just
want to share this because these are my
favorite videos to watch I love seeing
what people got in their Pio boxes maybe
I'm just nosy AF but it's fun why is
this happening do you guys see this my
hand q6 just from colour-pop i love
color prominent of these that means
update i'm broken please
a knife cute little no love it okay
colour-pop is a shock shadow collection
oh my god they sent me little shadows
had they sent me one of their lippie
stix I've been wanting to try all the
things were sending me oh my lord look
at that color
okay you know what's so funny I was
watching before was going to sleep cuz
sometimes I fall asleep watching like
makeup clips on my thumb like I just
shock Instagram accounts and without are
doing makeup and this girl was putting
this orange left on and chew so tan and
I was like that looks so nice in the
summer and I don't have anything orange
like that but now I do so color-block
read my mind I got two more lippie stix
oh no this is the ultra satin lip oh and
then they also got me a lip pencil oh my
god are these on matching yes they are
through that Sam and orange you pretty
color I love it this is from kendo
beauty group don't know what that is
let's see what's inside Marc Jacobs the
heck I think it's palette what is this
maybe it's not a palette I have no idea
what this is I'm really get to judge
their packaging is so fancy I'm
overwhelmed
it was bad oh my god thank you so much
Marc Jacob from the bottom of my heart I
didn't even know you all sent me
anything I'm two-faced is honestly one
of my favorite makeup brands ever open
they sent me their new born this way are
they concealers radiant concealers gosh
okay take all these bad boys out I don't
even know if I could ever get to that
many shades but I can use a dark winter
contour the light ones to highlight the
perfect ones to steal there's nothing
better than having every range of
concealer I'm telling you thank you
two-faced I love you it's doesn't say
where it's from I did not even expect
anything from Marc Jacobs I got a
beautiful palette I do not expect this I
don't know what's in here like God these
glow sticks what the hell does that mean
we are these highlighters oh my god no
it looks like sunscreen they're glow
sticks you highlight with them it's
actually a really cool idea see there's
another shade it looks the same oh
that's cause it's the same shade
I was like what put in the same sheet
again Marc Jacobs I am stocked up got it
please like so many they sent me a
suitcase I'm actually so confused oh my
god that's so cute they okay so there's
not make up but it's like a bunch of
carrying pieces milk pull through thanks

benefit gimme brow it's their stunning
