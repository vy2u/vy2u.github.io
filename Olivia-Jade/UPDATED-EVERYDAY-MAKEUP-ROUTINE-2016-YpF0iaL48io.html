I am doing this everyday makeup tutorial
I know I did one of these just a couple
months ago but now that it's summer my
routine has completely changed so with
that being said um I hope you guys
really enjoy this video I don't want to
talk too long in the intro so we can
just get straight into it I just kind of
chatted you through my routine if you
guys are new to my channel please don't
forget to subscribe and we're so so so
close to 200,000 so it'd be a dream if
you guys could get me there um anyway
let's go ahead and get into it I love
you guys and I hope you enjoy so first
things first I'm going to prime my skin
and I don't remember if I use this in my
everyday makeup tutorial last time but
this is my Too Faced hangover primer and
it is amazing it is so hydrating and
literally just feels like water on your
skin first things first of all we let
that kind of soak in I'm gonna do my
brows first thing I'm doing is I am just
brushing back my brows um basically like
that since we're in summer I try and do
like the absolute minimal amount of
makeup just because if I want too much
makeup in the summer I feel cakey I feel
gross it's just not even seen for me so
what the most makeup will be will
probably be on my face but for like eyes
and brows I'm keeping it super simple so
I just take the other side of this
pencil and I just literally go like this
a couple times just because it's like no
hair growth it there and that's all I do
because brow if you've got thick brows
you don't want to
in my opinion draw them on too much um
because then it just gets on natural and
I know that like lately the trend of
makeup is like strong highlight strong
brow strong I been kind
trying to transition at least for the
summer into like the more natural
wearable this might sound a little bit
crazy but I use my EOS chapstick next
and it literally you don't know what
this is it looks like a little egg you
know but I don't use this for my lips I
actually use this to tame the brows and
make sure that they're not going to move
throughout the day which songs are you
because you could get a brow gel or
something but brow Jose Nick my eyebrows
a little too hard I don't like that
crackly feeling so what I do with this
is I just go like that and then I just
go like that and there's a really now
stuck down and I brush it out one more
time just to make sure I'm happy with
them before they fully set and that's
what I do for us because super simple
super easy and you don't have to do much
and that's what I love for an everyday
look I would go between two things I
either go with a CC cream and this one
is my favorite it's a cosmetic CC cream
or I would go with my favorite
foundation which is the Too Faced Born
This Way Foundation I love both these
products so much for different reasons
I'm going to use a CC cream because it's
summer it's an everyday wearable kind of
look and CC cream has SPF in it so
that's what I'm going to use but this
also is so so buildable and you can
start with a really light layer of this
so totally your preference whatever you
guys want to do but I'm gonna do the CC
cream you guys have been watching my
videos for a little bit you guys know my
favorite way to blend out foundation CC
cream BB cream concealer is with a damp
Beauty Blender this is the easiest way
to do it it gets super super big I love
it also before we do anything else I'm
just going to moisturize my lips with
this Burt's Bees sweet violet what is it
tinted lip balm and it's like kind of a
cherry color but
makes my lips so moisturize and I think
it's just like a fun kind of summer
color and I go in with my cosmetics CC
plus or CC cream and I am in the shade
medium I absolutely love this stuff it's
amazing so what I do is I just like to
do one little Oh mol pump mind this out
I'm gonna put on my blender because I
was making a mess yeah I just blend this
outlet with the blender
you
so after I just pinned my ear back but
after you're done doing that I just put
like the lightest layer it's an everyday
kind of wearable thing and unless you
have intense acne where you kind of want
any full coverage look this is super
easy for girls that just don't feel like
they need or want full coverage and if
you do have acne I'm not saying you need
to cover it with foundation I'm just
saying whatever makes you comfortable
now I'm going to go in with one of my
favorite concealers this is the
maybelline superstay better skin I
seriously love my NARS creamy concealer
but I think it's just a little bit too
thick for the summer time in my opinion
it's great for winter it's too thick for
me in the summer so what I do with this
is I'm in the shade light and I just do
really light triangles like in the form
of triangle but I'm not being too
precise because I just want a really
little amount then I watch in a little
bit around my nose right there and a
little spot I'm not doing any crazy
highlighting or anything because it's
summer you'll need it you're going to
already be getting hit by a natural Sun
and I just blend that out with my
blender my cute letter
so after you are done with that I think
your skin is looking good fresh healthy
and then what I like to do personally is
I don't want to set my whole entire face
because I don't want to look cakey and V
I don't want it to look completely matte
I do like that kind of dewy fresh
sunkissed look I take my Rimmel stay
matte powder this is in the shade silky
beige 0:05 I love this powder I wanted
to hit pan and I'm not even close but I
use this every day I don't use any other
powder so I dip my brush in that this is
my Sigma tapered highlighter f-35 and
I'm just going to pack that under my lid
but what is I packed out I don't mean
actually pack that I just mean like aa
kit all let that powder fly and whatever
that excess is just under your eyelid
not under your eyelid what are this Cove
your under eyes I'm just going to set
that because I know I like when my
concealer stays right there
and I also like when it stays around my
nose on my chin and a little on my
forehead and then just because this is
super unnecessary but I do have really
veiny eyelids and sometimes I kind of
think it messes with my makeup look um I
don't even put too much shadow on or
anything but I do just like covering
those Mane's and I just set the eyelids
your eyelids don't ever really look
kinky so you can pack that on and it
will just make Shadow easier to blend
out if you're gonna be using a shadow
I use my Too Faced chocolate bonbon
palette so what I'm going to do with
that is I just take the shade mocha
it's just that matte Brown right here
and I just take this on my Sigma
blending e to five brush we're just
going to tap that in mocha and all I'm
doing with that is I'm just rounding
that into the crease
that's basically all I'm doing I've an
just after I put mocha and I just took a
little bit of divinity I'm super
unprofessional I just took it on the
same tapered highlighting brush that we
used to set our under eye and I just
blend without because lazy problems I
follow rules you know it's okay I just
use my ink liner from Kat Von D it's
just the tattoo liner in the shade
trooper
I'm just going to do the other side
super quick so now my other side is done
I just did it off-camera but basically
that's what I do I just do super super
super thin lines of eyeliner it makes
life way easier to go back on to my face
for a quick second I'm just taking this
new - I don't know if it's new but I
just got it it's the Too Faced Sun bunny
natural bronzer and it has like two
shades to it so I'm sorry for my little
baby hairs
they're the worst um basically what I do
is I just flow my brush around in both
both sides on my Real Techniques blush
brush I tap that excess off and then I
just contour with this and warm up my
cheeks
so that's basically what I do with that
it might look intense but just wait for
what I do it is I guess
and he'll bring the excess around my
jawline and the excess right above my
forehead just to make everything look
more even but it's totally optional and
then what I like to do is I just take a
big powder brush with nothing on it and
I just blend my cheeks out because I
don't want them to look unnatural and
what I do is I take my benefit
what's a highlighter or what's up and
it's just this cream a highlight and it
comes in like this little tube and it's
super super glowy and fun to eat so I
just put that on my Beauty Blender and
then just highlight with that and I just
do the littlest amount and then do you
see that it just automatically gives so
much shine to the look a little about my
lip and a little of my nose hairs out
now I'm taking my mascara this is my
Maybelline big eyes falsies lashes and
what I do with this is I take the lower
lash life and I use it on my lower and
upper lashes because I like that it
makes my upper lashes look more long
than super clumpy and I just go like
this
I'm just going to take the other side of
my lash the upper lash side I'm taking
the upper lash side and just kind of
wiping off some of the mascara on it and
just doing a like one two three kind of
situation just to give it a little bit
more thickness that's basically it for
my updated everyday and makeup routine
this is what I will be doing every day
in the summer I just gone onto my break
it's been amazing
so this is my go-to look at the moment I
hope you guys enjoyed it if you guys
decide to use it please please tweet me
pictures I would love to see your
beautiful faces in this look and it's
super easy super simple and a lot of the
products that I used were super
affordable and accessible I love you
guys so much and I will see you guys in
my next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
