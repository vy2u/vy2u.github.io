blog so see you guys good morning hi
guys so I'm on the way to explore
headquarters by now and I will keep you
guys updated and vlog on in there and
stuff but yeah just a little update
saying hi this morning because I really
haven't done any sort of logging at all
and I'm a mess basically
so no one knows where they're going so
we're trying to find four headquarters
made it what is all this
sandwiches different kind of salad this
looks like a garden salad with like
chickpeas and Romano
this looks like a taco salad this looks
like a spinach and bacon and Apple that
looks like walnuts goat cheese
cranberries I'm nervous
[Laughter]
did you get no tan lines was my favorite
oh my god guys it's me I feel weird I'm
in a bikini on mine is that weird like
what on my lips oh my god I love that
shade did you like there's perfect I did
a complete outfit change because I was
actually way too hot in my turtleneck so
now I'm just in like this and I took my
hair out I don't know I just wanted to
switch it up a little bit I don't really
know where we're going next it's 1:15
right now and we're gonna explore it San
Francisco which I'm really excited about
since I've never been here also really
one
house house because my mom like really
wanted me to go so I'm hoping maybe by
chance that they'll take us they're
gonna go oh my god it's a lot to deal
with honestly my hair I don't even know
what happened we get to go on this thing
and explore San Fran which is so cute
and cool and exciting we're on the
trolley and we're gonna explore and I'm
very excited
I know what's going on we just got off
the trolley and we're walking somewhere
I'm not sure we're not sure what we're
doing but you guys will find out at the
same time that I find out it's been a
really fun day so far we've just kind of
met with Sephora collection done all
that learned about some new products
it's really hot in San Francisco I
didn't expect this that's why I took off
my turtleneck I was wearing earlier also
because it looked like I like 1,200
chins with it on so you know that's not
a vibe anyway I keep stretching my hair
and being annoying so I'll see you guys
when I find out what's going on wait
what do we doing ladies
what is that wait I need a picture in
front of it I don't know which one the
full House house is but one of them all
right so what we've learned I faced on
my mom and she told me that these houses
aren't actually the full House house
it's on Broderick Street but this lawn
is where they shot like the opening
scene for a full house like in the theme
song and I think that's where they all
like come and sit on the picnic and
they're like another whatever I don't
really know but that was really cool
I feel like I got to see a part of my
mom's young adulthood
the Golden Gate Bridge so scared
gonna break hopefully we're gonna be
fine hi guys I just got back to my room
I'm extremely tired
I'm gonna take my a kebab with these
support lets you make up waves
I just need all this stuff off my face
we have dinner with like all the
ambassadors and none of like the support
people are anything tonight it's just
all the ambassadors I'm like the worst
with remembering names so I need to like
go back and make sure I know all the
girls names well I know like summer
obviously sage and Kyra cuz we were in
Basterds last year but there's like 10
of us now so it's a lot of new people to
meet in one day
apparently this lip thing is really hard
to get off just lost it all day too
well I don't think I'm gonna wear makeup
to dinner
I'm gonna wear leggings and I my
sweatshirt and be comfortable morning
guys it's obviously the next day as you
can tell I'm with Kyra we're going to
the headquarters it's like 7:00 a.m.
right now what'd they say I think we're
going to the Sephora store like Risa for
a retailer oh okay well we're going to
store it I know so much and we're
getting I think a light breakfast and
then we have brunch at like 10:30 and
then we go to Chinatown and we shoot all
day and then I'm leaving at 2:30 I think
my flight is um and we wrap it like one
so I might be cutting it close I might
have to leave a little bit early
also how cute are these boots they're
from nasty out I'll link them down below
and then I'm wearing my jeans from the
goal
this is a setup we have like all the new
products which I'm gonna do like a whole
get ready with me probably at the end of
this vlog and then I got myself fresh
juice ready for my tutorial alright guys
so you know the festive fest freeze this
is the same flavor as the vanilla one
but it's just kind of not the same like
the texture is not really just saying
you know so I'm having a hard time get
out so we're playing around hi everyone
so as you can tell I'm obviously back in
my bathroom which means I'm home I had
the most amazing time in San Francisco
at Sephora collection and now I get to
do a little get ready with me because
I'm home I have all the new products so
it's gonna be super quick I'm kind of in
a rush because I'm gonna go out with
some friends so this is perfect since I
want to look super natural and light and
all that jazz I showered already and
stuff but since I was traveling and oh
that I'm going to wash my face so I'm
gonna be using the Sephora collection
cleansing oil in balm this is an amazing
kind of like makeup remover facial
cleanser that really breaks down the
makeup easily removes it what's really
cool about this bomb is when it touches
your skin it transforms into an oil so
it's not going to strip your skin or
leave it dry or anything it's gonna
really gently and easily remove all the
makeup without obviously like killing
your skin or being bad for your skin
it's also cruelty free which I know a
lot of you guys always ask about the
best part honestly it just effectively
cleans everything and you're gonna be
left with no impurities or anything it
lifts all that up cleaned your eye
makeup waterproof makeup which is like
the hardest thing in the world so I'm
just rubbing this all over my skin and
rinsing it off okay so once we are all
cleansed our skin feels nice and clean
I'm gonna go in with the makeup now okay
so off camera really quickly I just put
a little eye cream and moisturizer on
and just to prep my skin and now I'm
going to be taking my Sephora collection
of bright future fluid tint skin tone
sunscreen broad-spectrum SPF 20 bags I
tried this in San Francisco and it is
gorgeous you guys are gonna freak out I
know it looks like I'm wearing a very
dark shade but the thing with this is
you can use like a little bit of a
darker shade and it kind of ends up
matching you and like makes you a little
bit Tanner without looking like it's not
your shade I know that's hard to explain
but one of the girls was explaining that
to us so I'm just gonna apply this like
so I know this looks crazy right now I
just wait so as you can see I am just
blending out the skin tint right now it
has an SPF of 25 which is obviously
really good if you're going out you need
this in the summer the spring or even in
the winter it's good to protect your
skin I learned this at the headquarters
it's really cool because the lightweight
formula is blended with a lemon extract
which helps the complexion appear like
more shiny and luminous and glowy and
just gorgeous it's also super
moisturizing so it creates a really
fresh and healthy looking glow okay so
after I am done with that I am just
going in to blend out this lighter
concealer I put any concealer you guys
have works
you guys know Laura Mercier translucent
powder is my favorite whatever you want
to use is totally fine so these are the
support collection bright future radiant
Luminizer 's these are three gorgeous
shades that I got what cuz I put them
too close to my sink so you can put
these under your eyes your Cupid's bow
and other like targeted areas that
they're designed for I'm going to apply
them kind of to my cheek and my Cupid's
bow you guys are gonna die when you see
them I'm gonna use this shade called it
champagne but they also have them in
shade table Mac and Rosie which is like
a light pink and a more gold and this
one's kind of like a champagne a pinkish
gold like a mix you guys can wear this
alone or on top of your foundation and
concealer I am personally gonna wear it
on top alone is gorgeous all these nails
top products is also gorgeous
it doesn't like settle in to your fine
lines or create streaks or anything
which is really nice so it's very subtle
it is one of those products that looks
like you're glowing from within I know I
talk about Sephora collection all the
time obviously one of the ambassadors
I'm obviously super
obsessed with the brand but if you guys
are on a budget
this is high-end makeup likes for
collections kind of known for having
high-end makeup for more reasonable
pricing I think people don't realize
like these types of products are made in
the same types of factories in these
high-end places like NARS in Laura
Mercier and all those great amazing
brands but they just have more
affordable prices because of their
packaging and stuff this literally just
glides right on top of my makeup and
kind of gives like the glowing from
within look I'm putting on my cubit to
hell huh gotta go I'm sorry I love that
and then you guys know I'm obsessed with
my button nose highlight so this app kit
it makes it super easy
I'm just glowing today people I'm gonna
snap my fingers and then come back with
my makeup on ready 1 2 3 I just put a
little eyeliner and mascara on nothing
crazy
and I'm gonna do a lip color you guys
know I always talk about these for
collection lip stories they're eight
dollars through the creamiest lipsticks
in the game I've said countless amounts
of things on my Instagram and channel
and I was just hosting an Instagram and
giveaway of these definitely check it
out I was giving my a whole vault which
is all these lipsticks there are forty
shades they're incredible so I kind of
want to do something fun and like a
brighter shade today because I obviously
a very neutral makeup on so I think I'm
gonna go in with this shade from the
global citizen compartment to the home
and this one is called first class
shade 25 this is gorgeous orange e red
so it comes with three finishes matte
creamy and metal this one is a matte
you guys eight dollars and they're so
creamy take my hair really quick
white boy that powder I don't really
want a contour do anything I feel like
this looks pretty natural and good so
this is my little get ready with me I
hope you guys enjoyed this I will have
all the products linked down below of
course thank you for watching I hope you
guys enjoyed this vlog I had so much fun
with the other ambassadors and obviously
I love finishing off the video with a
little get ready with me with some of
the new launches because I don't know I
just feel like you guys definitely like
when I kind of do more affordable things
so getting to be a brand ambassador for
a company that resonates with that
message and wants to spread that is
really cool and I'm super stoked to be a
part of it so I talked with my hands a
lot these lipsticks are actually crazy
oh you know what actually before I go I
kind of want to try putting this color
in my inner corner to highlight ooh oh
my god that's a look alright
signing off now that was exciting I use
the shade Rose day for that thanks for
watching guys I will see you in my next
video hey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
