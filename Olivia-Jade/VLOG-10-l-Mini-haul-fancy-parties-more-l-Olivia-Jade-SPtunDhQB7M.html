back to another vlog and today's video I
am doing another weekly vlog I have so
many exciting events but first I'm
kicking it off with a mini clothing haul
from Windsor because this video is in
club with them you guys know I work with
them all the time and I got some really
cute summer pieces let me know if you
guys want me to still do like major
clothing hauls for the summer leave it
in the comments below but I'm just going
to show you a few pieces I got from
Windsor then we'll carry on the rest of
my day in week so hope you guys enjoy if
you're new and don't forget to hit the
subscribe button and yeah thanks for
watching so I am opening a box from
Windsor right now for like some new
summer clothing as I say that the rest
of it is black awesome no but they have
some really cute swimsuits I'm gonna try
some of these pieces on show you guys
what's up I'm really excited about this
top how cute that is 34 90s also
everyone needs like a pair of white
high-waisted swim trunks these look
really high-waisted but I think they'll
fit once they're on this little cute one
piece I don't know I'm gonna try some of
this on and I'll show you guys okay so
this is the first dress it's so frickin
cute I'm obsessed I accidentally just
pop the button off instead of
unbuttoning it I tried to step into it
like an idiot so I need to sew that back
on but yeah I'm really absolutely I
think it's really really cute so I'm
calling me that never happens oh wait
there's a snapchat from my sister and an
Instagram post like from my mom wow
that's really sad god I love that this
top is everything I've been looking for
and more it literally fits so perfectly
yeah thank you it's very flattering ten
out of ten I also got too lazy and
didn't want to buy my shorts of all I'm
showing you guys this top and it's one
of the bathing suit opps not showing you
the bottom so I'm just wearing shorts I
feel like the bottom it's a little bit
revealing got to leave something to the
imagination but the top is cute and the
BOD
just match and yeah this might defeat
the purpose of not showing my bottoms
but this is a really cute the sauce the
socks make the look but yeah this is a
really cute little cover-up so cute I'm
literally obsessed with this bathing
suit top I wish I could just wear this
out forever
like do you think I could wear this as a
top in the summer let me know because
it's so cute by the way I'm gonna link
everything down below of course so this
little dress is next it's just a little
black mini you can zip it unzip it if
you want to be scandalous have some
cleavage showing you can but yeah this
is what it looks like do this is that
little body or little bathing suit one
piece I might be a little too light for
it if you like a darker complexion I
think would be really pretty so this
body suit is really cute it's like mesh
and then obviously where your boobs are
it's blind I'm really - its oh wow cute
so cute I don't want any other words
besides cute okay I didn't expect this
body suit to fit so well and it's
actually really cute oh my god I'm gonna
strangle myself if I say cute one more
time but it's just this plain black
strapless one and I thought it would
like fall off when I raised my hands and
stuff but it doesn't so pleasantly
surprised and it's a really good staple
this next top it's just a little tight
off I think it's very precious darling
adorable um I don't know I think it'll
be great for the summer a little thing
you can throw on without thinking very
easy and quick and you get the point so
next up is something else we'll see who
knows okay so I'm kidding that was
everything for my clothing haul it is
stunning in LA today I'm gonna show you
guys a little close-up of my outfit
