everybody welcome back to another vlog
obviously I just woke up it's Monday
morning if you're new to the vlogs I do
a bunch of weekly vlogs out somethings
flight I also do a bunch of fashion and
makeup stuff I haven't done a lot of
that in a while I just have been
focusing on vlogs but if you guys want
that please let me know I do a lot of
halls within my vlogs like fashion hauls
because I think it's cute and it's easy
and then we get the best of both worlds
that's it I just signed up for a Pilates
class I haven't worked out and so
frickin long since before Coachella
dead-ass haven't worked out since then
so that should be interesting we'll see
how that goes and then not that's at
10:30 it's 855 right now I'll probably
leave my house around 10:15 ish and I'm
gonna go make some breakfast and you
know just bring you guys along with me
obviously so don't forget to subscribe
and let's do this I also have graduation
this week which is crazy it's on Friday
so I'm very excited about that because
then I'm officially done first things
first I need to clean all this like
right now this is bad really really bad
so I'm gonna set that up we're gonna do
a little cleaning montage
I also just decided I'm gonna clean out
my closet so we're cleaning montage and
getting rid of stuff crazy
all right I I honestly can't really
clean anymore I get way too sidetracked
so we're gonna do baby steps I'm not
gonna clean out my closet right now but
hopefully I will eventually still really
messy I want basically everything to be
clean having a bagel you need to cut it
beautiful
aha hi guys
so I totally realized I forgot to intro
my little mini haul within this vlog I
worked with NASA gal and they sent a
bunch of pieces so I'm just gonna show
you guys a few that I think would be
really cute for this summer and by the
way I've read your comments and I
totally understand if the vlog has a
sponsored content you guys want like
that end of it to be longer does not
make my making sounds like I understand
that you guys don't want the whole vlog
to take up like just the clothing haul
you like seeing clothing but then you
want the end of the vlog to be longer so
you have like more vlog footage then
clothing haul footage I think that's
what I've gathered from reading the
comments so yeah cuz I'm stressed
because I'd like a lot of sponsor not a
lot of sponsored content nothing that
I'm not like really happy to do but I'm
like getting a little stressed cuz it's
all at the same time and I don't want to
like upset people but also like I really
want to show off these brands and yeah I
really like what I'm working on so it's
like an in-between but yeah so I'm gonna
show you guys a bunch of cute pieces
from Nasty Gal and then we'll carry on
with the blog and I'll make sure that
it's nice and long for you a nice weekly
blog if you guys don't know what Nasty
Gal is I used to shop there all the time
when I was little it's basically like an
online clothing store it's also the
perfect go to shop for any occasion like
there's this really pretty pink dress in
there that I'm probably gonna wear to my
graduation um brunch I didn't get it
tailored but you'll see they have a
store in LA I don't know if it's so open
but they used to that I used to shop at
so I got my first body suit that I was
like really obsessed with and they have
a bunch of stuff basically it's gonna
help you transition your wardrobe into
like summertime because they have a lot
of good summer pieces right now and then
on top of that they have clothing for
everyone for all different prices and
it's all available on Nasty Gal com
obviously I'm gonna link it below and
check my description box if you guys
want exact links to some of the items
this is the first top I actually really
like the cut of it and the way it fits I
think it's really cool just a little
sporty beach bar
so this is another little t-shirt I
think I would wear this more if it was
cropped so I think I'm gonna cut it into
a little DIY I'm gonna cut it and then
I'll come back and try it on okay so I
wanted to cut this one a little shorter
so I could wear it with a bra that like
Peaks through I thought that'd be kind
of cool yeah now it's one of a kind but
I liked it long as well I just feel like
I'll wear it more in the summer if it's
a little bit cropped this bodysuit is
the coolest thing I've literally ever
put on it was so confusing cuz it's like
you have to twist it around your neck at
first but now that I actually once you
step into it and then you just like
basically halter it and then do a little
twist it like lace so perfect but I
think it's so freaking flattering I
don't know I've never literally never
seen anything like this I think it's
really cool this might just be my new
favorite piece and it gives you like a
little I don't know I love it absolutely
love this okay so just focus on we'll
get to the bottoms in a second but just
the top half this is a really really
flattering and also very different
unique little bathing suit just so you
guys know this one piece and this comes
separately and then you just put this on
and then this on top because obviously
you couldn't wear this by itself but you
could definitely get a bunch of
different Bandos and like switch off the
colors and then I'm gonna show you guys
I'm the pants with the matching top okay
so now for the full outfit I literally
am obsessed with this this is so cool
umm yeah obviously you can wear it with
like a bikini if you want like skin
showing just for the sake of trying
things on I'm leaving this little one
piece on but this is a really dope set
and it's perfect for summer and then
also this little cheetah print cover-up
I love this this gives me like very
classy vibes like with your wine and
Italy I really like this I think it's
very flattering thank you okay so this
is the next bodysuit I think it is
flattering and fits really well and yeah
I just really dig it it has a little
side boob so if you don't like that
maybe this isn't for you
I don't know okay this next piece is
literally so pretty I just need to get
it taken in a little bit so it hugs
tighter up here but it's just like this
little romper slash maxi dress I don't
know what you would call this but I love
it it's just a little bit big in the
shoulders
I might wear this to my graduation
brunch I just have to tighten it a
little bit but so freaking stunning
okay this is everything I've ever wanted
it's a body suit but it's a turtleneck
body suit oh my god now they're leaf
blowing outside but anyway it is so soft
it feels really really comfortable on
and it literally fits like a glove like
it's perfect love that and then also
this little belt is from Nasty Gal cute
you can bobby pin this with a black pin
if you don't want it sticking up really
really really nice okay okay so next is
this little set I think it's really
pretty and very summery um yeah this
just what it looks like on I don't know
why I try and explain like you guys have
eyes so time has come
I'm about to go work out I've altered
anything literally so long this is so
this is not good just put on this sports
bra I think it's a low with Lululemon
gonna put this shirt on and yeah here we
go
Oh guys also it's raining like it's
raining right now and it's summer or
it's supposed to be summer yeah so
gloomy so it is obviously the next day
um I just left school it's 12:00
and obviously you guys already saw my
last day of school vlog if you haven't
own link it below but now I am going to
get lunch with Bella and we're gonna go
get salad thank you fellas although
right the hotel it's very beautiful here
if you're a tourist want to come to a
good la spot and you want to spend all
your life savings time out of ten would
recommend the Beverly at all it's so
good Bella matrix okay guys so I know
it's been a few days I just don't well
you guys would have already seen it but
I just felt my whole graduation now I'm
headed to my graduation brunch and I'm
gonna put that in this vlog so we're

outside room that's a little cold but

so obviously it's another new day this I
think it's like my first real weekly
vlog where it's been like so sporadic
with all the different days in a really
long time but it is Saturday morning
I guess it's officially my first day of
summer and my plans are to get a facial
I'm gonna go downstairs any breakfast
and then I'm gonna hopefully remove my
self tan off my body and apply a new one
and maybe get a manicure I don't know
we'll see it I wish it was warm enough
to go to the beach but it's not because
then when you go to the beach again when
you go to the beach okay oh my god you
scared me you come in here all right I'm
good
hi everyone so I left my facial a little
bit ago and literally like 10 minutes
ago and my skin feels so much better
I go to Maggie skincare in la ma ttyl
skincare she's amazing
if you guys need like a nice facial
she's incredible
my facial was around $200 a little bit
more than that and I'm not telling you
that to be like it's expensive maybe
that's expensive some people maybe
that's a cheaper facial some people I
don't really know I'm just saying that
because if you want to go and you want
to know the price point I'm just trying
to be helpful okay now I'm getting gas
in my car and then I'm gonna go home and
eat lunch cause I'm really hungry

burger mm-hmm so guys I'm gonna end the
vlog here I'm gonna start a new vlog
