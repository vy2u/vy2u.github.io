I'm going to go upstairs and take my
makeup off I'll bring you guys along
okay so first taking my eyelashes off oh
gotta love that see the difference
hair is up so what I normally do I
haven't done a little skincare video in
a while do a little bit of micellar
water this one's by simple turn my brain
is a little con pad and pour that on
there and then I just start by taking
off my makeup collective because I wanna
ask what I do is skincare so I'm showing
you make sure you did your neck I
literally never sleep with makeup on it
so out for you then after that's all off
of my skin I usually just take a
cleanser I've been using this glossy a
milky jelly cleanser and conditioning
face wash because I know it also takes
off a little bit of makeup so that's
what I do and then I just throw on some
moisturizer and I've been liking this
fresh vitamin nectar moisture glow face
cream I love anything by fresh you guys
already know that and that's why I
couldn't get routine so I will see you
guys in the morning
morning everyone it's obviously
the next day I just woke up and had some
breakfast and then I'm gonna go to
Pilates right now so I'm gonna brush my
teeth do all that you like to see me do
this in like every vlog and you can see
me go to Pilates before so hopefully I
have something different to do in this
book do you guys mind that the blogs are
repetitive do you guys want me to go and
force myself to do adventurous things
for blogs or do you like just kind of
seeing like my everyday behind the
scenes in my life I don't know you guys
let me know in the comments below
I love reading your feedback I don't
really have a good workout outfit on I
just threw on this little tank top and
then black leggings it is so hot out but
I'm obsessed with this weather finally
feels like summer
I shouldn't take the time to give myself
a Twitter promo if you guys don't follow
me on Twitter you should all right
that's all I don't have good reasoning
but Val and I are going to run errands
I'll show you guys a quick outfit of the
day and then those shoes okay so we just
got to my for the hills we're going to
Hanson's cake a cake for my dad because
it's his birthday I can't even go to
dinner with him tonight because I have
my elementary school reunion but yeah
I'm still picking up a cake I wrote him
a card and I'll spend tomorrow with it
oh the cake place ended up being closed
so that was a complete fail
I honestly my shoes look really dirty I
don't even remember the last thing I was
talking to you guys about because it's
been a little bit of a crazy day it's my
dad's birthday today
so we had to go to sprinkles and get him
cupcakes after Hanson's was closed but
that's okay we did that I went to Rite
Aid picked up a razor deodorant just
stuff that everyone needs and then I put
on a jacket for my outfit I'll show you
guys please hold
what I'm wearing - oh I'm going to my
elementary school reunion this is why
I'm dressed so I don't know is it weird
to our crop top with all the parents and
like old teachers I don't care did some
very glowy natural makeup put some of
the ashes lashes lashes watches let's
get English but some little lashes on by
our Dao they're just the whispies little
tinted moisturizer bronzer highlight is
sure oh it comes up so I tried to put
like a little lace bra so if it flies up
like it's okay I don't know
Wow does anyone remember this photo
booth effect anyway I thought someone
judge me I forgot to end the vlog the
last thing you saw was this kid that I
wouldn't I might just go with he's
