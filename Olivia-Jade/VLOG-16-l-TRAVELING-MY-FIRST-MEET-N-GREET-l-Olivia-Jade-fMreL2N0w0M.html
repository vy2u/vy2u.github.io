also I self-tan myself before I came
here and I woke up and I had to leave
for the airport but my sheets were
literally orange that has never happened

was about to hand spit and I sucked it
up
I am super smart not to brag and I
brought bobby pins put some stuff on my
face this is a glycolic pH resurfacing
gel I actually have no idea what that
means but it's not for you I'd call it
here my facial say that word facial it's
coming I hope you guys three muses tell
me he could balance on one foot and one
hand it's pretty cool

at all those boots oh my god would
people really pay like 200 bucks for
those Wow sorry if I'm offending anyone
I think I'm gonna go full out maybe I go
like cheetah print oh my gosh they're
like bedazzled and um I mean it still
look like a little boy I'm about to look
more like a boy when I put this on in
Texas where a dress and boots I don't
know oh yeah that's a look it's just so
funny what's the ugliest one I'm like
Australian okay just my calling
it's very like Spice Girls coyote ugly I
wish this was Spice Girls this is bad

face and we're gonna take photos on this

little bit upload and then I will film
you getting ready so I'm bout to get
ready
and since my legs are gonna be showing
I'm gonna put on some of this Sephora
collection supreme supreme body butter
and then we're gonna do the makeup I am
in we have ten minutes to do makeup for
the meetup because the woman that did my
hair the first time the ponytail was too
low and then the second time was like
really high and I just didn't like it
and I never speak up but since there's
gonna be a ton of photos I was like girl
I don't know how I feel about this part
but just trying to like what I'm gonna
start with the eyes in case I have to do
my face makeup in the freaking car hi my
eyes are some concealer it's gonna be
the fastest I've ever gone ready ever
and then I'm gonna set that down a
little bit of powder I'm taking this
brush kit they gave us because I want to
use this blending brush it was for
collection pin rows clever double brush
set so I'm just gonna take like a
transition shade
and then I think wanna keep the eyes
pretty simple I'm gonna take a little
precision brush and just dip into a
darker shade and line that's just gonna
have to do this right now and then I'm
gonna take like a little smudge brush
and whatever I did in my crease I'm also
just gonna blend down here smoke it out
cool I'm gonna take a little bit of
liquid liner and just do a really thin
cool I'm gonna curl my lashes put a
little mascara on Wow I'm being crazy
messy right now I was gonna do
individual lashes but like it's gonna
take a hundred years right now and I
don't have much I have no idea what
lashes are gonna look good
I hardly ever wear lashes okay I'm gonna
put lashes on and come back and back
that I have five minutes to get ready
and do any of my face makes hi I tried
eyelashes don't look at their best
you really don't I just hope they stay
on I'm very stressed right now a little
bit of glow I'm gonna put some
foundation on well I have light
Beauty sponge all this doubt I'm
concealer on one very quick okay Howard

killing it right now I just pulled this
out of the tube of course why wouldn't I
