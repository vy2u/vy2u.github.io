getting breakfast with one of my friends
this morning and I'm not really sure yet
so if I get breakfast with him
oh time blog really awful blog haven't
seen him in a while so kind of she want
to catch up but I have a really crazy
filming day ahead of me and I'm getting
stressed honestly I have to film two
videos today I should be interesting
like goes I also have to make sure I get
those two videos done and then another
video filmed for another upload okay
I've made it to the bathroom I am going
to be talking about this product
it's that purity made simple moisturizer
by philosophy it's their new like ultra
light moisturizer and it is amazing this
video is in club with them but I've been
using this for about a month and I've
just never disliked a huge change in my
skin it's getting like a lot like the
pores are less visible my skin's a lot
brighter and I also notice like instant
change when I put it on which is really
cool so like it kind of feels like very
smooth I'm just gonna apply pump to my
face this can be used with or without
makeup looks super pretty on your skin
normally or if you want to wear it with
makeup it's a great primer it smells so
good it's packed with really really
great like good for you ingredients and
it just gives you a really nice glow
24-hour hydration like as you can tell
my skin is just like instantly funny
I've been obsessed with it
obviously I'll link it down below thank
you for Lassa fee for getting me this I
love it yeah if you're looking for a new
moisturizer it's really lightweight it's
perfect for me my facialist only I was
using too heavy of moisturizer I was
like it was clogging my pores so this
one is doing the opposite okay right now
to get ready I need to put it off it on
and some makeup actually I don't know
one more makeup I donated but now if it
on itself
ah alright so I'm in the car so freaking
hot um in my car play some music

nail colors I actually looked at the
name this time this one's topless and
barefoot okay I'm gonna go to my

home and as you guys saw I had a few
little clips and like snippets of our
workout if you guys want me to do a full
workout routine let me know but you guys

she went shopping for an event we have

bit while she's shopping and then we're

transformation is so real it's crazy um

video so some jewelry I'm gonna go
through this and see which pieces I'm
gonna put in the video on what pieces I
don't like and then start working baby

to the grocery store they're like nice
and melted now okay this is cookies and
cream
that's vanilla and that's chocolate I

try it but I've had vanilla before oh
well they're really melted no really
good vanilla especially the better
chocolate just chocolate tastes like
