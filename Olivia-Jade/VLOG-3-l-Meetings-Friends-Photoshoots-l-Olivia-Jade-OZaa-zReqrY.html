I'd bring you guys along for the day the
usual vlog I believe I've worked a
little bit before this so this shouldn't
be the start of my vlog but it's now
Thursday it's one o'clock I got enough
to school a little bit early since I had
free last and oh my god it says my
camera is gonna die I mean you'll get a
new battery well that's getting a latte
so I have my hair done and then I put it
up already because I just oh no it's a
cheese video oh yeah thank you though
hi everyone sorry I've been so all over
the place this is the look I can't
really show you can I know it's a little
jumpsuit and nude boots and I were going
it's always bryant's decision where we
shoot because he's the mastermind so we
shall see but I'm really excited and I
have to go now I'm gonna grab my jacket
cuz we might run a little behind
schedule coming soon actually I always
say that and then we post the photos
before I remember it so you guys I'll
put them on the screen right yeah
in his element just came up here and
then we walked down that way
let me shot a little bit over there now
we're going somewhere else so bright we
just drove like 45 minutes from where we
were filming and now we're just in this
big-ass parking lot wow this is cool we
get Bryant set up guys we're at a
restaurant just so I pick what to wear
what else you keep in your bag
very nice love it
okay just like Mary Poppins
hi guys so I'm home now I had the best
photo shoot with Brian we just finish
today this videos going up tomorrow
because I like keeping it like really
close in real time I think it's more fun
to watch it like you guys know exactly
what I'm doing
that's creepy okay hey sorry my camera
just died um I'm back but yeah I had the
best shoot with Bryant but basically you
guys aren't gonna see the photos right
now because we shot today and this
videos going up tomorrow so it's I
thought this video would end up going up
next week but I want to post it tomorrow
instead so that's what I'm gonna do but
I had such a hu I have all this clothing
on my floor right here and as you can
see my closets are getting a little bit
out of hand my room is just getting
super messy I definitely need to go
through and clean basically everything
but I did want to show you guys a few
pieces that I got from it princess Polly
you guys can use my code I think it's
just Olivia Polly yeah they always give
me a new one cuz mine cuz they like
expire after sometime so if you want 20%
off it's just Olivia Polly but I'm gonna
show you like some jackets and stuff the
jacket I was wearing earlier today when
I was getting my nails or I didn't get
my nails when I was getting my hair done
and stuff I'll link it down below it's
forever 21
it is so cute and it's really affordable
so I definitely want to show you guys
that maybe I won't try this on right now
in this vlog I'm gonna do an actual
proper clothing haul but I'll show you
guys a few pieces so before they go out
of stock from forever 21 so this I'll
put it in a clothing haul because I'll
try it on eventually like proper but it
is this jacket and I think it is so
frickin cool it's inspired by the Acne
jacket my sister actually has the Acne
jacket let's go to her closet and I'll
show you so keep that one in mind
and then the Acne jacket is is better
yeah it's better cuz it's real but like
that's so good
how much is that one like a lot right I
do want to compare them to show them
that you don't always need to spend the
big bucks to get the same look like
that's pretty damn good
I mean obviously it's not great no I'm
just kidding I honestly am pretty
impressed with forever21
like they didn't do but they really even
did like the
well they I think they did a good job
and it's a way better price and they
have like the double kind of buckle here
like that one has the only thing that's
really different is well a lot but like
this part is different texture and then
letting the leather
well obviously this is really no and
this is not but yeah I think it's a
pretty good dupe you know what I'm not
mad about it and it's really cute on and
this you guys is so soft I'm like shut
oh and then this was the jacket I was
wearing today that's also forever 21
this is kind of like another kind of
knockoff version of one of the acne
jacket but this one was so cute on right
Bella today yeah it was so cute that's
basically it I was gonna just do a full
trial on clothing on then I decided
against it because I want to do an
actual video that oh my god my whole
life is just messy like my bathroom is
mess and I really need to clean it and
my enclosure is cracked but I'm gonna
wash my skin right now and then I'm
gonna show you guys this mask that I've
been obsessing over bellies did today
how amazing was it if the mixers get
instantly perfect it's gorgeous
I'll show you guys okay so this is the
mask it's the fresh ultimate nourishing
honey mask and it makes your skin so
smooth I love it I may need to get my
nails done tomorrow they are looking
roof let's see it
Oh Bella just got it colored yeah it
does look really bomb and it comes with
a little spatula and then you just go
like this
see you guys if anyone has any tips for
getting rid of a zit that's been on your
face for like ten years
LMK although I feel like it's going down
a little bit since I started putting
this on but it really is not going away
and I've been to my facialist twice
can't take my hand I'm too lazy to do
this it's on my skin I look a little
crazy but I'm gonna wash this off and
then I'll show you guys what it looks
like after totally forgot to mention you
just leave it on for eight to ten
minutes um just in case you were
wondering so I just took the mask off I
can't tell if you can tell but I can
notice a huge difference it's just like
my skin feels a lot better and healthier
and like glowing basically but that is
gonna be it for today's vlog thank you
so much for watching and I'll see you
guys in my next one thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
