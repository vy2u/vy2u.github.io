another vlog I have just woken up it is
Saturday morning I just threw my workout
clothing on I'm about to go to the gym
and meet up with my trainer and get a
good session in getting super healthy
for those of you wondering the meal plan
it's going well basically the meal plan
essentially is just low carb high
protein that doesn't mean no carbs cuz
carps are good for you and your body
needs cards I don't want anyone coming
at me like you don't know what you're
doing I didn't even make this meal plan
I'm just testing it for myself it's so
funny because people can be so sensitive
to that sort of stuff so I feel like I
have to be really sensitive to that sort
of stuff and I don't want to cause
anyone to feel like they have to eat
like one thing a day and like you know
like starving themselves like that's
really unhealthy and they don't want to
put that on anyone
so I'm not a nutritionist and I don't
really know I just don't want anyone to
feel like they have to look a certain
way or be a certain way cuz you're all
very beautiful the way you are I just
was feeling a lack of confidence and I
wanted to get in better shape for myself
so that's what I'm doing my work out
here is never that fun I'm just wearing
all black kind of a basic out but I'm
gonna put my work out wow this lighting
is very nice my room but I put my
workout shoes on and then make some
breakfast downstairs so CNN cutie just
made some egg whites and a corn tortilla
it's not very interesting so I'm in my
car right now I well it's actually Mike
I'm in a rental car right now cuz my
battery died on my car so it's being
fixed I don't really know if I like this
car I've been driving a different car
and it's been really high up no I'm like
I'm gonna go no blogging and driving I
will see you guys in a little hi guys so
it's been a little while since I picked
up the vlog camera I don't really know
exactly what happened actually but like
10 20 minutes into it I felt really
lightheaded my face got really pale and
I kind of just had to stop working out
and I had to do some stretching and then
drink Gatorade and like go get food and
stuff I think I'm really tired I've been
like really overworking myself I don't
know I just couldn't do it
so are usually really good at working
out like I really go for an hour and
like push through and work my actual ass
off but today I don't know what happened
like I couldn't do it is 3 o'clock I
have a hair appointment in 30 minutes
and I'm picking up my friend Charlotte
and then we have a birthday dinner for
one of our good friends later tonight I
will catch you guys in a little bye hi
everyone I literally could not tell you
the last thing that I vlogged but I am
in my youtube room right now I just went
to my PO Box as you can tell there are
boxes behind me
and I just thought I would open some of
the packages do a little haul yesterday
I don't know why I didn't vlog it but I
cleaned out my whole entire YouTube room
literally outside my door I'll actually
just show you there's like a whole pile
of trash outside my youtube room right
now I'm starting to take that out but
you know just the beginning stages of
cleaning okay
sorry if there's noise in the back
there's a little bit of construction
going on around me but Fila sent over
these dope shoes I actually been wanting
a pair of shoes just like this so that's
awesome and a little note so cute let's
see what else is in here shall we oh wow
they really hooked it up oh my god what

Oh cute it's a little shoe keychain I
love that it's dope okay so these are
probably my favorite PR pack just
receive because you guys know fresh is
my absolute favorite skin care any fresh
stuff can be so expensive sometimes so
I'm like always hesitant to buy it so I
love getting this but it is really worth
the money I noticed a huge difference
with my skin and one time I went to the
store and met with um some of the people
at fresh and they were just telling me
about like the creator's oppression like
I don't know they just seemed like
really sweet people that like really
want to help others with their skins
Lotus you've preserved a rescue mask and
this black tea oh I love construction
and this is a body cream goo kombucha
facial treatment it's a five-minute
journey and look that I am grateful for
what would make today great I love home
and really try that little thing you
wrap around your head when you're doing
like makeup so loving tan sense the most
right are you just Olivia and Bianca oh
my god why me why why why they're really
soft one teeth there's no one for my dog
and for my axe which is great I'll just
keep it for myself
alright we also have my favorite tanner
luminous cream and then the bronzing
mousse loving tan is one of my favorite
brands / tanning or it is the only brand
I use for tanning actually so very
excited they always keep me nice and
stocked and that's why I am ten right
now because of see woah it's pretty cool
okay so I'm definitely not gonna be
probably any of these shades I'm trying
to this new thing where right away I go
through my shades I pick them out I put
them away and then for the ones that are
my shades I give to charity I usually
just take like the first for Shay
because I think this is gonna be too
dark I can't really tell though so I'm
gonna have to play around with those oh
my God my mom used to have these
concealers when I was growing up I
always well I still see her use these
it's funny yeah thanks why I saw its
awesome I'm really excited to try these
they're custom highlight drops from
Lancome and then a few foundations some
concealers and foundations six that'll
be so fun to play with I can't tell if I
like this lip color what do you guys
think this is the BH Cosmetics collab
with it's my ray-ray
I'm in the shade Rosie and then we also
have it in a lipstick and I think it's
los like it's kind of pretty right it's
like maybe for summer I don't know
they're affordable and look how nice it
looks like it's only once as you can
tell I've been like playing around
anyone wants to say hey to the vlog
someone says hi someone else's eye
everyone's saying hey oh love you too so
what's a hi vlog
oh my god you're cutting your cob
bowl-cut
he's actually just missing a bowl on
your head and cut around that he's like
we're not doing that first
I'm putting right Harris the next video
you'll do it won't be like a jailer
Caleb this is how architecture works
right
the back has to be shorter than the
front it's just the way geometry works
because your shoulders get in the way so
they make it all square there's just a
waste of time so it's slightly one run
only because of the body so when we give
that here in the back and then it'll be
about here in the front this with your
ears here
[Laughter]
that's a lot of hair and keys that's Joe
Olivia starts crying Olivia shots of it
a little bit fell in the front wait
as welcome back to my vlog it's Olivia
Jade here I just got my hair cut and
this is a voiceover I'm flipping it up
oh my god wait I love it oh my god it's
oh my god well I don't really so much
hair yeah well is what it looks like I
love it
it looks so cute I like older so you
guys this is one person it's in the
trash and there's some right here it
looks like you cut like 12 different
people's hair oh my god
I just chopped my hair off definitely
shorter I feel like when just a lot is
on my mind which a lot has been on my
mind and you just kinda need to like get
rid of all that negative thoughts and
energy perfect way to do it is just
chopping your hair so she's gone but I
love it so I just got ready for dinner
put a little bit of makeup on and then
in my outfit I would show you I mean I'm
still gonna show you but it's just not
very cute
it's like pretty much what I wear all
the time it's my IMG a jacket this
really soft sweater from Lulu's black
Lululemon's
furry little Gucci slides basically it
it's been so rainy and crummy in LA I
put very minimal makeup on I just did a
little bit of concealer under my eyes
literally one coat of mascara and then a
lip tint my bathroom is a mess but you
know what I do with that I shut my door
and I deal with it another day my
friends gonna pick me up in like five
minutes I'm gonna get dinner with all
the girls and yeah maybe you guys will
meet some of them they feel comfortable
being on camera
that's Bella that's Chloe that's Lily
that's Iona that's Charlotte hi I'm back
so I was at dinner with my friends and
I'm home now and I'm gonna take my
makeup off I can't get my hair in a full
ponytail anymore so this is Alyssa's
gonna get for my makeup removal process
I am going to do a little face mask I
think I'll just do a sheet mask because
I sell tan today and I just want to like
get back the hydration and everything I
have a facial this weekend which I'm
very very ready and excited for I have
another dermatologist appointment on
Tuesday to see if they can figure out
why this it hasn't gone away since it's
been on my month Pam I spit on my face
for about four and a half months and
I've been to my facialist twice doesn't
know what's going on there's nothing
left in it so I think it might've
scarred so I might get it hopped away or
maybe like a cortisone shot or whatever
it's called I don't really know but yeah
so hopefully it'll go away eventually if
not then I guess it's a part of me now
but I'd rather not be like that uh I
want to use this mask this is a number
one mask in the u.s. apparently it's
orange in the clean improvement octave
charcoal mask to clear pores good
morning it's obviously the next morning
it's so weird I'm not used to it all
obviously it happened yesterday since
it's Friday
I'm a senior I've never seen your
privilege is you get dressed on Fridays

a uniform at my school and one spring
break today so I can film tons of videos

warm today I'm not sure trying to pick
out a shirt right now but I don't know I
haven't want to wear my PJs that's so
bad I don't want to an actual alpha I'm
sorry that's not happening today I'm
wearing leggings in a hoodie I literally
don't care my game is get a hoodie oh my
god it's such a mess in here maybe this
yellow one yeah maybe I'll put some
color in my outfit there we go

have two scrambled eggs I make a corn
tortilla sometimes you do egg whites

fast and easy I don't even know if it's
