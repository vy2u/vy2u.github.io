any foundation except I kind of am
actually it's a powder foundation though
so it's not like a liquid so it's super
light it's the Sephora collection matte
perfection powder foundation this is my
new favorite thing in the whole entire
world
so I basically I didn't put any
concealer under my eyes or anything I
just used a little bit of my chart shape
tape in light neutral and I concealed it
like oh my zits because I have a lot
from the Sun right now and then I just
basically set my whole entire face with
two brushes that are now God they're
both Sephora collection
this isn't sponsored this one's the pro
slanted buffing detail it's in number 89
and this one's the pro slanted buffing
in 88 you guys those four products are a
dream combo but anyway I'm gonna head
out right now

breakfast spot which we will and I'll

don't even think I film the breakfast
did I did not I suck at vlogging oh my
god I filmed the latte I think now we're
on the way back to our house I'm gonna
film a video and then I have to figure
out if I want to go shopping or work out
I think I'll probably work out and then
I also got my ears pierced yesterday got
like four piercings and then I'm gonna
go back next week after Coachella and do
this side because you shouldn't do it
all at one time because then it makes it
really really really hard to sleep I
just touched it I woke up like four
times the middle of the night not being
able to like roll over on the side of my
head but hopefully it'll go away soon
hopefully I Coachella doesn't get
infected
cuz that place is dusty forget how much
hearing that it's half of its gone so I
t's like
so when we come in out it's going to
have like the scene with
Logan is going to go into some like
popular pieces because we so it looks a
lot right now
but when we take out the foils and like
on the color and everything it's gonna
be like very beachy very seamless you're
very Coachella finishing touches I also
just uploaded a new video while I was
here
so if you guys haven't seen that I'll
link it below
my tripod
so nice guys all have GG's links down
below if you're in LA need a blender or
you do all colors but you want my
haircut
yay there's the finished product
this is just the beginning stage okay
this is what our Coachella fitting has
come to oh hi everyone um I can't even
remember the last thing I've logged I
haven't blogged in such a long time and
my room is kind of crazy and messy not
too bad but it's a little scattered
because I got back from Coachella this
morning it was so fun but I'm literally
exhausted it's been such a long time
since I've last vlog I really miss it
but I just felt I don't know I felt like
I was just doing the same blogs over and
over again and people were getting
really bored and sick of it even though
no one said they were bored or sick of
it I got my own head so I kind of
stopped blogging but so many of you have
asked me like where they are and how bad
you want to see them again so here we
are yeah welcome back I just post mated
food
it's 5:30 p.m. I just woke up from such
a long nap I literally fell asleep like
two hours and so my food should be here
in my be five minutes oh my God look how
cute right now on my chair I have a
stack of clothing because when my
stylist came over to help me pick out my
coach hello looks we got a little messy
but I'm obsessed with this bathing suit
this is my brand and it's so awesome
it's like this red checkered where's the
top because that's like my favorite part
see how everything just kinda gets lost
like I need to clean out my closet baby
yeah look how cute I love it I think
it's so cute and then what else I really
like this little skirt
a little white skirt so cute and beachy
you could make this really cute with
like um a bathing suit top and boots for
like vacation I don't know what this is
is this actually the right thing hold on
one second so these are different
bottoms cute I don't think these go
together but they have a similar pattern
also my friend Brian oh you guys know is
photographer just sent me this picture
from Coachella put on the screen I think
it's really really cool and then he also
posted this one love those I've been so
obsessed with this it's lemare
moisturizing soft cream the mayor sent
me a little package and I've grown
obsessed definitely
oh I wasted so much of that I hate
myself feels so good on my skin after
Coachella you know you just need like to
be refreshed my skin has been breaking
out like crazy that's also I think a
reason I wasn't vlogging I was so
insecure about it and I know to some
people it's probably really small but
like I had this massive thing on my
forehead that's kind of starting to go
away at this I still have this even
though I already got this laser at once
because I forget what it was but it's
basically something that's never gonna
go away unless I continually xoring it
and what when we get bigger so I've been
really insecure and I feel like all of
my breakouts have been turning into like
permanent marks so like I guarantee in a
few months time I'm gonna still be
vlogging me like it's still here I don't
know what's going on if you guys have
that issue or know how to fix it please
let me know because I'm very confused I
also have been really liking this lemare
micellar water if antenna vlogging so
long it feels so weird
yeah my foods gonna be here in five
minutes I'm very excited about that and
yeah I'm just gonna bring for my night
what I get up to us move drill if you're
new here don't forget to hit that
subscribe button give this video a
thumbs up if you haven't seen my room
tour yet I will link it down below
everyone seems to be like non-video I
don't know bye everyone probably but a
lot of you have shown a lot of positive
response so thanks and yeah I also
bought this waterproof and then I got
two more tart shaped shaped concealers
because these are my face yeah I really
have been obsessed with individual
lashes so I picked up quite a few packs
of those I got in a becau toe roll and
edamame that's dinner I don't know if
this is considered really unhealthy or
kinda healthy or like what is sushi
considered I'm not sure I guess this
isn't really sushi but you know what I
mean but yeah I'm just gonna eat some
dinner now I'm really hungry it was so
fun being a Coachella but like you don't
realize how little you eat and how much
you walk because you don't really have
time to eat you're like go go go
so every night when I got back to my
house from Coachella I would make myself
like the grilled cheese or something
like so unhealthy and disgusting but it
was so good at the same time I don't
know I just thought I'd share that so
I'm trying to get back to like eating a
little bit cleaner probably won't work
and I'm probably a really gonna try and
start tomorrow because I feel like the
day after you like like the madness and
the craziness you kind of just need like
a recovery day that's what I'm taking it
not working out today I'm just chillin
please excuse my break outside just I
can't I'm gonna do a taste test even
though I order from this place all the
time
actually don't know what this place is
it's just close to my house mm-hmm I
feel like I should be a next move longer
whenever it's called
Luke bong if you love watching those
videos like I now see how many I watch
but I feel awkward how do people like
talk I'm like I don't know I don't think
I'd be very good at it
I was something I eat I like enough in
one sitting to do the phone video
because don't people order like raisi
amounts to do that I'd get full so fast
but I would do want and I would go
really hard I need a lot of food if I
did it with Trisha Paytas but other than
that you couldn't get me they do it I
don't think only with Russia because
it's cuz she's a queen Oh
oh my god actually so done wasn't
looking where was point because I was
trying to vlog it and I just missed my
cup Wow Wow go me I'm so smart okay that
was such an owl this is why I suck at
vlogging this is why I can't I'm kind of
glad I got that moment on camera Oh
Olivia such a fail so I've decided I
would answer a few questions because
like I don't really like sat down and
answered questions in a little bit of
time so I'm gonna go under the hashtag
ask Olivia Jade can I do a closet tour
yeah I can do a closet tour I want to do
that really badly so give this video a
thumbs up if you guys would want to see
that and then I'll do one for you
what has been your best or worst
experience of paparazzi or tabloids um I
would have got my car accident that was
the worst because a lot of like the
media twisted it saying like I was
texting and that's when I got in it
or I mean because I was vlogging and
driving and that's when I got in it and
I wasn't even blogging when I got my
accident I literally was just sitting at
a red light and someone came and hit my
car for mine or one side of my plate was
i driving I don't remember I just wonder
someone's smashing into me so um yeah
that's my worst experience just because
my mom was really upset about it she
obviously didn't know what happened so
she called me like freaking out like
what happened I was actually worried
sure they just found that much my worst
experience probably how did you get over
the fear of hate you might have had when
you first started on YouTube sorry
YouTube judoma had a lot of friends
embarrassing me I really want to know
how to push through it and he managed to
become so positive today that's a really
good question something I get all the
time actually because when I first
started my youtube channel I was also
like really insecure and I dealt with
the exact same thing it's not like
you're the only one you know and I think
if you really like doing it then that's
more important than what other people
are gonna say about you I mean to this
day even though I am like doing well on
YouTube and stuff people will still
insult and criticize and be brewed and
even at parties like people come up to
me about it and like can I be on YouTube
channel kind of in like a mocking way
and it's just annoying but like it
doesn't really matter cuz like it makes
me happy it's worth it there's nothing I
can really tell you to do but I just
think you really have to like understand
that it makes you happy and you're
genuinely passionate about it it
shouldn't matter what anyone else is
gonna say well I thought about something
really quickly that one of my friends
texted me about she is kind of like an
older sister to me and she I guess knows
I guess her maybe her friends daughters
or something watch my videos and they
were there like 10 years old during
third grade or something and were
complaining to their mom like well why
don't I look like that she's so skinny
she has boobs all this stuff right skin
is clear she doesn't have braces and so
my friend texted me about this and like
big sister I don't really know what to
call her well call her D uh-huh
so d cuz I don't know if she wants me to
it's her name text me about this and she
was like what do you want me to tell
them like I don't know the whole thing
really broke my heart because first of
all when I was 10 years old I was in the
most awkward phase of my life and second
of all I don't want anyone to ever
compare themselves to me and I know it's
kind of hypocritical for me to say that
because hypocritical for myself because
I compare myself to other people
literally all the time like I look at
other peoples Instagram page and I'm
like they're so skinny they're so pretty
their skin is so clear and I always
think to myself like which I know what
probably a lot of you don't think I do
but I look at their pictures and I'm
like well if I took that selfie earth
that was my ankle like I look so ugly I
wish I look good like that
and it's so hard cuz it's so easy to
judge yourself on social media and
compare yourself to other people but
like actually being on like social media
with like a lot of people that look at
my stuff and now that I realize a lot of
people compare their stuff to mine it
breaks my heart because you guys
obviously don't even see half of it half
the photo that don't post the one photo
that turned out great I'll post with the
other 12 that I took are like complete
and I'm not going to post those I'm not
gonna post my sad days and me crying
even though that's like probably a lot
more realistic my lifestyle and like not
that I cry all the time I don't but like
you know like more emotional stuff and
like not looking perfect all the time
and not like having smooth skin and like
not editing out this it's you know what
I mean so it's really hard but I don't
want you guys to compare yourselves to
other people because I promise come in
firsthand you don't see like the photos
are the bad angles like I'm sure I can
pull up a photo right now that I would
never pose and I know even people are
gonna get like why are you even talking
about this like this photos fine but
like to me I would never post this
without like severely doing something
some filter or something cuz I think
like my nose looks crooked sorry my
memory card just ran out of space but
what I was saying anyways like this is
something I wouldn't want to post
beeping my photos I'm just video up and
leave me a comment if you guys want to
see how I edit my Instagram photos and
like what filter I put on it or Shia not
use too much editing the
as I said now that I realized people
compare themselves to me I don't want to
put out like false images but I
definitely have a certain filter I like
that makes me a little Tanner and it
kind of gives like a pink cast to my
photo so it kind of like all flows
together anyway I'm probably boring you
so I'll see you guys in a little look
who's here hey Andrew Andrew Byers in
the house
thanks so much I'm sorry I got a duck
yeah you did
we're going to freeze hey hey so we're
getting freeze which is nothing new
because we always get freeze but Andrews
just got back from New York so we're
really happy he's home so pretty out
this is my squad
of course use my crease now I'm going
downstairs and we're all going in my
jacuzzi right our jacuzzi is been
excited oh also my hellofresh box came
today I'm doing like five videos with
them I think it's five in like obviously

few months I am so excited because I
have some really fun cooking ones
planned obviously I'll like do it in
blogs and stuff you want cooking with
Bella and Olivia to come back if you
