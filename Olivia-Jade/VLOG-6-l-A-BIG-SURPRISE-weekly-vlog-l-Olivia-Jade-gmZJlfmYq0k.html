channel
I am obviously doing another vlog and
it's actually starting at night because
I want to show you guys if I'm making
dinner tonight as I said in the previous
vlog I am doing videos with hellofresh
so this video is one of the videos I'm
doing with hellofresh
and yeah if you guys don't know what
hellofresh is I'm gonna get into it in a
second I'm gonna pull out all my
ingredients for the meal I'm gonna make
and then yeah we'll just make dinner
together and I'll blog my night and then
this will probably be a weekly vlog so
there will be more ahead to look forward
to but I'm a little sick right now I
don't know if you can hear my voice my
mom's facetiming me hi I'm vlogging
happy blogging thank you love you so
basically it comes in a box and then it
has like three separate things and then
the meat comes differently I was
freezing this because I didn't know when
I was gonna film this so I'm gonna have
to defrost whatever I'm making I kind of
want to make cheeseburgers because I
love cheese and then it also has like
the nutritional info and then how to
make each meal here we go oh that looks
so fire this is what I'm making let's
open this up
this looks amazing obviously this is
really convenient if you travel a lot
because you can like pause your account
for weeks at a time I travel all the
time so if you're wondering like if it's
gonna keep renewing you can pause your
account oh they have all sorts of stuff
in here okay you know like those mini
like shots kind of like sometimes I'd
like and you see in stores like mini
tequila bottles or like book I thought
that's what that was at first I was like
what it's not also I don't know if you
remember in my last videos but I didn't
get any of these options last time it's
nice because it changes like meals
weekly it's nice because they offer a
wide variety of chef's traded meals that
will train you weekly so if you remember
like in my last vlog I'll be save
different meals then the last time I
worked with them because obviously it
changes I'm not a big ketchup person do
you guys like ketchup an onion it's also
really nice cuz then you don't go to the
market I hate going to market okay we're
gonna get this going I obviously don't
feel great I'm kind of sick right now
but luckily this shouldn't take over 30
minutes that's what's great about it
it's quick and easy and it's affordable
because each meal is under $10 which is
bomb so let's get to cooking so this
shows you guys like all the different
things and steps I'm pretty picky I
don't like a lot of stuff which is also
great because it's packed separately so
like I don't like onion jam so I'm not
gonna make onion jam but that's okay
because you don't have to and if you
make it for a family there you go oh
that looks fire is it bad to eat dairy
when you're sick I can't swallow I feel
disgusting so that's cooking I just
finished my burger I'm really excited
about it I think hellofresh really
allows you to like go outside your
comfort zone make new things you
wouldn't normally make you guys are
going to hello fresh calm and use my
coat Olivia Jade 34 $30 off your first
week and now I'm gonna taste that's it
I cooked it all the way hmm oh my god
it's so good you guys I'm a chef that's
fire I rock all right I'm gonna go eat
this now um I'll leave this to you guys
later tonight or tomorrow at some point
in this vlog every time I order from
hellofresh I kind of just kill it so I'm
really proud of myself
morning everyone it is Sunday morning I
am still a little bit sick but I feel so
much better I actually didn't end up
vlogging this past weekend or I guess
Friday and Saturday because I was so
under the weather that I was like you
know what it's just not happening
I also accidentally slept with a face
mask on and just from this part of my
face and I just rubbed it off so it's
really red no cuz it took like actual
scrubbing cuz it got stuck on my skin
but I just thought I'd blog today it's
about 9:00 a.m. I'm just gonna bring you
guys along to when I get up - you guys
know and I think I'm only gonna start
doing vlogs in my youtube channel okay
actually that's not true but like I
think I'm mostly gonna start doing blogs
because vlogs will get like 500,000
views and then other videos will get
like a hundred thousand views and so
that's pretty evident to me that like
people want to see vlogs not really
anything else I don't even like really
filming like how I edit instagrams like
I don't choose like I don't care to film
that I just thought that's what people
wanted to see it but I don't really
think that's what people want to see I
think people want to see the vlogs and
let me know if you guys still want to
see make tutorials I love doing makeup
obviously I'm super into it
but I also want to film what you guys
want to see cuz it makes me feel the
happiest when like the response is super
positive on the videos so just let me
know um
I look crazy I just woke up and I'm
gonna go make myself some breakfast I
think my sister and and Roy down stairs
and just really just a like a part of
the family now he's I swear I hear
