starting out on my floor right now I am
actually filming on the new camera I
just bought I just got that Canon a DD
with what lens I don't know shout out to
David though because when he came over
he had this camera and I was like I
don't want that so I am doing a vlog
obviously a weekly blog and then I just
thought I'd started out with a little
clothing haul since I got some stuff it
was alright so let's see there's this
one dress I bought from Zara and I
really think it's the prettiest thing
and I'm really excited
okay so shoes first box
what am I get oh yeah these are fun do
you guys think these are kind of fun for
the summer these I think this would be
so cute with like a pair of Levi's and
like a top like this color
I thought those are kind of cute there's
the other one
okay then I'm also extremely pale right
now I haven't been in the Sun in quite
some time
these shoes I'm so excited about
actually okay I understand this isn't
gonna be everyone's taste
but I think they're really cool just
platform sneakers and with a little
spice to them I got another pair of
shoes these ones are so cute they're
just little slides I think it's a little
bit of height not really but they're
just looked like that and then this
dress is what I was talking about I
literally think this is my favorite
dress I've ever seen ever I'm like this
is so not something I would ever buy if
you know me I'm like so neutral with my
colors but I mean it's just like this
gorgeous maxi dress I'm gonna try it on
and then I'll film it because I'm so
excited this was like $169 so it is I
guess pricier for Zara I don't really
know I love it I'm really excited about
it and then I got this little dress I
really like these printed dresses and
that's not like me I think it'll be so
pretty for the summer like in Italy
can't you just I don't even know if I'm
going Italy like you know can't you just
see that don't you just that's my haul
let's go try that dress on you guys I
just put this little dress on that I was
just talking about and it is so cute
I'm going to show you because I'm like
literally obsessed with it it fits so
perfectly the back is like all open I
love this this is like my favorite
summer dress so cute also just for like
a little bit of a closer look you guys
readin is like one of my favorite brands
in the world and they hooked it up I
can't even believe it like thank you so
freaking much
I am shook so I'm gonna just lay out all
the pieces and then I'll show you okay
so this t-shirt a white t-shirt a black
like scoop t-shirt then similar to the
white one this is just a tan a light
blue and then this really cute black
bodysuit that looks like this and then
so that's it for the t-shirts and then
look how cute these shorts are like with
the little zippers on the side and then
these jeans are perfect so this is like
the ideal mom Jean love that and then
are you ready okay and then also look I
keep the silky Jada's and then for the
best part and I'm still so shocked and
like woah
they sent me a leather jacket oh my god
I don't own one leather jacket I don't
know faux leather real leather anything
so shocked and I can't even thank them
enough
like I will wear this all the time I may
get so much use out of this thank you
thank you thank you thank you thank you
a white one in this pattern and then
like this baby blue is so pretty I have
anything to just like oh it's from
Frankie's it's this exact material in
color but it's just a different shape it
like has the tie knot I don't think this
one has a tie it's different because
this one is just straight across the set
of the tie and then the little bottoms
and then I'll check the shape of this oh
it's just a triangle top you can see it
right there
YSL really came through with the lip
colors and also did anyone know more if
we came out with highlighters and stuff
I had no idea if you guys want me to
like fill them with those and test them
out let me know but this color is my
favorite thing ever for summer
does anyone else agree yeah anyway and
then some pretty nudes wow I like don't
even know what to do with all this I'm
gonna do a little giveaway pretty soon
guys so make sure follow my Instagram
and my Twitter
and snapchat for that I'll have them on
the screen hmm I really don't want to go
to school I thought it'd be fun to do a
little morning get ready with me for
school I've done stuff like this before
but I just feel like I want to do
another one because it changes every
morning and it's like a little vlog I
travelled yesterday I like literally
took off where dude went to a business
meeting the meeting was three hours
talked about some really good stuff that
I have coming out then got back on the
plane landed went to go pick up my car
from my friend's house and now I'm here
so that was pretty cool
usually the first thing in the morning
that I do is check my phone but that's
boring and I kind of want to get out of
that habit but I just heard a buzz like
12 times now I'm curious if someone sexy
me because that's a rare occurrence
though actually it was one my friends so
like that's cool right okay I need a
shower
I knew wash my hair because I watched
you guys today but it looks greasy and I
don't understand why all right ready and
we're gonna go and I gotta go to school
so I actually really need to go okay

in the whole world
what's this frickin song Iggy Azalea

she's still living breathing and chillin
oh my god I just freaking knocked off my
toothpaste that gross if I use it I
don't care
I don't know if sink water is bad to
drink but I'm gonna take an echinacea
and a sink with a little bit of sink
water I think with my sake that wasn't
funny fun look at a little bit of it
might take two of these because I'm are
open no I'm not going to take three
let's see how this goes
actually should I even try and film this
yeah said the war's over
I'm sorry this looks really gross I
score how do I even go about this I
don't work a new route it's hot water
makes me feel uncomfortable
oh my god I can't do it you very close I
feel pretty much our really hot in the
morning
whoa I have another vlog that's just
like this like that looks like this okay
well I promise it's different this is
the intensive revitalizing mask by la
Mer Wow I use way too much oh it's way
too expensive to do no problem I'll add
on there then I'm just gonna let it soak
into my skin those sides there we go
alright let's get dressed
yay school I'm in a really weird mood I
don't what's going on with me
I changed nothing so I got something
pointing with you do you think I'm weird
okay yeah I said it alright it's a 56 I
leave my house I'm like 10 seconds my
school starts at 8:00
if you're wondering but I'm never on
time I don't have a good reason but yeah
let's get ready right shoe is almost won
come on come on bug night groceries oh
if you're new here and you don't watch
my videos I don't wear makeup to school
because I don't care where is everyone
where's my family okay I want breakfast
one sec back from school I'm gonna
self-tan myself because I miss being
dark this is what I use it's like green
around it just ignore that it's a loving
tan in ultra dark and then I used a
little mitt and I just moisturize on
like my knees my elbows basically that's
it like my wrists my ankles beforehand I
don't want to show you because then I'll
be butt-ass naked I thought I'd show you
how I self tan my face I do like this
much I don't put any moisturizer or
anything on it
some people do I personally know I
usually take like a cotton pad and kind
of like press it out I don't know I just
get scared and then I really just take
my bit and go all the way around my face
and make sure you blend down you're like
John to ears you're not
and I just blend the rest down my neck
how I do my arms and stuff is I just
take it and go like this okay I look
crazy
um don't worry it always looks very
normal
once it's washed off so if you two look
like this after yourself tan don't freak
out okay so now I just wait six hours
and it dries in 30 seconds so I already
did my body obviously I'm nice and
bronzed and I'm gonna wait like a minute
and then I'm gonna put some sweatpants
on I'm gonna go to get my nails done get
the color change and just bring you guys
along for whatever else I do in this
blog yo guys so I'm about to leave my
house go out and get my car washed
because it rained my car was like really
dirty on the outside but I guess it
doesn't matter I'm really really
confused by this weather right now cuz
it rained and it was just sunny out but
I travelled yesterday and when I took
off it was like sunny and I was hot and
I'm where I landed was a little bit
colder and now I'm confused I think I'm
gonna go to my PA box before I get my
nails done it's like that makes more
sense just to grab the boxes when my
nails aren't freshly manicured and let's
just hit my gate I've been fine okay I'm
actually leaving now so I'm gonna no I
make it sound like it's illegal even
