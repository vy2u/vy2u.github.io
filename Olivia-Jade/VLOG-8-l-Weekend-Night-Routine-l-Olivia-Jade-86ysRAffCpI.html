channel
I'm Olivia Jade if you're new here
what's up you should subscribe I'm doing
a blog style night routine weekend
edition of whatever I'm gonna call it I
don't know and yet I just thought I'd
bring you all along this is Sunday so
it's Sunday night right now I am about
to get ready to go to dinner it is 3:30
we have a really early dinner with
family friends we don't do this every
Sunday but you know on the occasion and
yes I'm gonna get ready for that I want
to look semi-decent and my hair looks
disgusting so I'm gonna start by curling
my hair
this video isn't partnering with Conair
I'm gonna get into all that in a second
I've already used this tool before and
it's so sick that I'm like actually
excited to comb my hair so I'm gonna
brush my hair and then I'll be right
back
um I parted my hair it'll look better
when I curl it but I might be talking to
you guys about two different products oh
my god Birds be quiet I'm filming oh
that sounds so pretty hmm okay so
basically I'm gonna talk to you guys
really quickly about two different
products because I was debating on what
I wanted to use either the curl secret
2.0 which I have a picture of right here
or the two-on-one styler which I'll have
right here I'm gonna end up giving my
mom the two-on-one styler which I will
film because I think it's a really cute
Mother's Day gift I'll talk about I
guess the two and one side I'm imagining
I'm putting a picture of it right here
so if it's not here that's awkward my
hair looks crazy good thing that's gonna
be fixed in like a few minutes any you
just a few little pointers about the
two-in-one Siler
that I want to talk to you guys about
really quick and what Connor wants me to
tell you guys about so it's nice because
it's soon one you can straighten or call
your hair at the plate seat up to 400°
that outer barrel heats up to 265
degrees it also has a 30 second heat up
so it's really quickly so you don't wait
there's also five LED heat settings for
every single hair type so it's got you
covered
now hop welcome on the screen again but
you can buy both these connor products
at Target they are available there I
always freak it up how I talk about the
two-in-one styler so I'm just gonna read
exactly what it is
was the got show in the clip guys extra
long one 1/8 inch black titanium ceramic
coated floating plates protect her for
less damage during styling so how about
that that's pretty cool actually
okay and then what I'm gonna be using
today is to the curl secret 2.0 like
this thing
my Jam's basically turn it on the little
red light goes oh it has too much
changeable barrels and all you call this
this one is one-inch this one's one and
1/4 inch obviously for tighter curls or
looser curls and then also on the side
you sell the button it has like a bunch
of different settings until we get this
hair party started I'm putting my hair
up because it's not okay right now also
hot I know somewhere I read it says
ionic technology yeah so it doesn't make
your hair frizzy it makes it like nice
and smooth and shiny which is awesome
this barrel heats up to 450 degrees I
think I saw the other one heats up to
400 degrees and minds confuse them I
think well this one heats up to 450 450
Wow all right look great say gotta love
it though okay still love me so it has
two different heat levels low and high
and then it also has three different
directions for your hair types we're
gonna get more into it once I use it but
basically the button has stopped by
linking so now it is go time you guys
are gonna be mind-blowing ready for this
okay so I'm just sectioning off my hair
into two oh but your ink into two
sections you face this part towards your
hair you guys are going to be super
shocked I think here we go
you just take a piece probably should
put some makeup on but Yolo you
literally just stick it in here like
this press down it eats your hair beeps
and then you just let go and then you
have a cute little curl and then I'm not
gonna brush it out and I'm like
basically done
that's so fascinating I love it cuz I
hate curling my hair so I want to do
work it has three different curl
directions for loose medium or tight
waves and it also has a tangle free like
technology so your hair is not gonna get
tangled like it recognizes when it's
tangling it and then it stops has an
auto beep indicator for full proof
styling so you already heard that but
yeah I'm just gonna speed through this
and let's curl my hair I'm back so I
just finished curling my hair I'm just
gonna kind of like comb through it like
this yeah I think it looks cute just
like a little loose beachy wave so now
I'm gonna go give my mom the two and one
straightener
I hope she likes it happy early Mother's
Day mom thanks Conair for all of this
and the links will be below you can
check the description box for more
information so let's go give my mom her
karley lon
wow this is longest beginning a night
routine ever there we go mom yeah I have
a gift for you you have a gift for me
yeah it's um oh this is so cool I could
use this really do like it
I do I like it a lot ok then I totally
bought that for you with all my money I
saved up they did not send me that or
asked me to give it to you know yeah
it's cool because it's a straightening
iron and you can curl your hair with it
it's two and one look yeah and all the
directions are in it do I win daughter
