pretty you all right yeah I'm all like
this look
I really did good
you're so happy monkey
Gretchen area burger yeah really good in
today's vlog I had no idea what's going
on I just thought I pick up my camera
cuz I just got my new vlogging camera I
realized that it is ordered the same one
as my last camera I actually upgraded to
the g7x
mark - I think this was old I'm not tech
savvy but it's Thursday night March 2nd
I have so so much homework and studying
in so I literally have like two quizzes
tomorrow and a test no three quizzes
tomorrow and I test on Monday and I have
a busy weekend going off - I like
studied for myself on Monday a little
bit at the tutor today and then not have
to study for my other three quizzes
tomorrow
I honestly am just really stressed so
I'm probably not going to show too much
of this vlog but this is just to get
started
oh yeah look at this little face this is
not the most beautiful thing you've ever
seen in your life you are so pretty
you're so pretty it's not fair
alright such a pretty puppy oh thank you
she literally my life so I just ate some
dinner
I literally just made myself a
quesadilla - because I'm lazy and I am
going to get ready it's Saturday night
it's like 8:30 I'm gonna get ready to go
out in the shower and wash my
and then blow-dry it and then la la la
la so I've got out of the shower and I
want to put this in my hair before
blow-drying I had this in favourites
video I think I don't know it's cold
L'Oreal mousse the Lord so I just got
ready for the night it's like a 9:30
right now and I'm just going to head to
my friends house pretty soon he'll
probably just kind up a little bit
before we go out
I'm also you guys my outfit I don't have
shoes on but it's been kind of nice and
a life so I can get away with a skirt
I'm not wearing this really cute
bodysuit it's like a turtleneck from
Nasty Gal and then this skirt is my
sister's I don't know where it's from
but it's so cute and then I'm just going
to put shoes on so my legs look longer
need to kind of clean all this up this
always happens when I do makeup so I'm
going to put this all away Sam it's a
little cleaner not that much cleaner I
don't know what to do with this big box
though it has all these amazing
eyeliners Marc Jacobson and when I
seriously mean if you guys need a pencil
eyeliner that's like super pigmented
they have matte gel eyeliners and gel
crayons
whatever highliners they're like shimmer
ones I was debating about wearing these
sneakers right here that are like
platform they're from ash or if you
suits which are from Zara but I think
I'm gonna go with the boot you can't see
myself from when I'm walking you can see
them in looking oh oh oh that's friend
Maya hello hello
I don't want my keys okay
bye lucky see you later I look so tired
we went to longer than to lunch no
breakfast brunch with my mom and dad and
now I just ordered an acai bowl or a
thigh on up say it for as much thank you
so much should probably learn how to say
it
I just wanted getting ready to go to
basically like my little brothers but if
I'm a janitor since be 16 and 17 so
basically like my brothers um birthday
dinner yay Wow slo-mo
this is I'm sure just a part of a blog
that's already happening I need to
organize my bathroom and also my beauty
room it's only 7:30 right now so I don't
really go to bed till 10:30 anyways my
gives me a good three hours to try and
get my stuff together I really need to
organize this situation because it is
just not working anymore and basically
it right there I have on the makeup and
then they have a bunch of sunglasses and
bags and then random stuff up there so
this is all kind of organized at the
bottom there it's like I don't really go
in there I could definitely get rid of a
lot of that but I'm just not gonna worry
about it for now
this middle section this right there is
what needs major help
okay so basically what I'm trying to do
right now is just decorate my makeup my
everyday stuff into two sections and
once I figure out how to do that with
everything I will come back with
organized makeup hopefully progress what
so I finally organized it kind of better
than before right and I know I was
supposed to do all this but I just
didn't get around to it and this I mean
all this is all extra makeup I'm going
to bring to my YouTube room this is
Natasha Brae and these are cameras that
are broken that I don't think I'm
supposed to throw out broken cameras can
someone please tell me what to do this
broken cameras like none of them work
and they're not ever going to work and
then yeah

headed out on a mission it's already
four o'clock I hate wait start to my day
when I'm actually doing stuff and
because of schools but I didn't get out
to like after three so that's okay
