trying to upload a video my Wi-Fi in
here sucks and it's saying it's gonna
take 18,000 hours I'm not exaggerating
like it says eighteen thousand one
hundred and ninety-six hours so not
ideal but hopefully it'll work out
crossing my fingers at this point hi
guys so I just this jacket makes so much
okay I basically just had a really nice
day shopping with my mom and I never
bought it cuz I was letting my camera
charge and I was also uploading a new
video so the memory card how to be in my
computer cuz I was editing on there I am
ready right now for the Marc Jacobs
Beauty dinner I'll show you guys an
outfit so it's like this little dress
with a mesh turtleneck under it this
Valentino trench tights and off-white
boots I wish my tights for a little bit
more see-through I ripped my see-through

is so intense she brings her light okay
we're on to foundation what shade do you
think I'd be I think you are are 300
yeah
medium cool gonna try it out people and
just approach will give you guys the
review on it but I've tried it before
this and it's really nice gorgeous it's
kind of is it light it's like oh I would
say it's a light coverage and kind of
sheer and it has the texture of skin it
doesn't look like you're wearing my
favorite and it feels really light
weight which is what I liked about it
when I tried it also guys if you didn't
know the reason I'm in New York right
now for Fashion Week is with Marc Jacobs
and the launch of this shameless
foundation and that's why I think
everything in my room when I got here
he's on the blog was I called shameless
last night the dinner party was like
surrounded around the new foundation so
it's been really fun but yeah I just
want to show you guys the foundation
this is the look so far we will come
back with a full review when my makeups
done you guys this is the final look
it's I'm so excited I have a really
round head though so I'm like nervous
about the ponytail but I'm obsessed with
the makeup I'm gonna go get dressed and

Week's buffer she got that for me and
then my bodysuit I would
love to take off the puffer but it's
also cold but like the bodysuit no I'm
really obsessed what do you guys think I
