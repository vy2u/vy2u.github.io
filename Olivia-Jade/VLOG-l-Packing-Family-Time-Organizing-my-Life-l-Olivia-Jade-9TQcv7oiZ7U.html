I'm going it too at lunch and shopping
with my mother and this is a really
artsy we're at lunch right now we're at
the Polo Lounge my hair looks crazy a
little update I just got home it's about
1:45 ish I left lunch I just uber at
home wasn't the original plan but I need
to upload at my Friday's video so I
wanted to do that and get that up so
it's at a reasonable hour instead of
going shopping with my mom and sister
that's okay I really wanted to come home
and upload and just like get in PJ's not
gonna lie so I'm home now and I'm gonna
do that and then wherever the day takes
me I'll bring you guys along with me was
I'm gonna toys she has in her bed I mean
why are dogs the cutest thing like what
how are you this cute so I am about to
work out right now I feel like it's so
important and I've been on such a roll
with working out and I really see like a
muscle and strength but to say I feel so
much healthier so usually a little sneak
preview I start with a three minute walk
and wow I'm walking for three minutes I
walk out like a 3.2 at an incline of
like 4 on the treadmill I'll show you
and then I have my heart rate monitor on
I talked about this in my favorite video
but basically it connects to the app
pair this isn't sponsored but it
connects to the app pair so I'm just
gonna make sure it's on and working and
then I'm gonna start doing intervals
great way to burn body fat in hit
high-intensity interval training I said
that was weird but the app burn spa so I
like doing like a minute sprint and then
coming down for a minute and then going
back up for a minute coming down for a
minute and then with my heart rate
monitor I can just see what zone I'm in
so I usually push myself to his own 4 or
5 recover to his own 1:45 recovery to
his own one that probably makes no sense
to you guys but if you guys want like a
whole fitness video I'll do that soon so
basically what I'm gonna do now is go up
to a speed of 9 and then you'll see my
heart rate starts to go up and then once
it hits a 5 or a high 4 I let it go all
the way back down to a 1 and that's
high-intensity interval training good
morning guys it has been a minute since
I've logged I really missed vlogging so
I just wanted to pick back up the camera
and film my day for you guys
I actually do have a pretty fun day
planned but first I want to do my hair
because I'm gonna go downstairs and film
a video I post twice a week if you don't
know that both Tuesdays and Fridays so
the weekends are always filled with me
like pre filming since I'm in school
Monday through Friday I want to make
sure I have videos ready for you guys
so I think I'm gonna film a what's in my
purse and just take it really old-school
back to YouTube because I feel like if
no one really does these videos anymore
and they are so fun to watch in my
opinion at least I love seeing what
people keep in their purses so I'm
probably gonna film that and I'm gonna
call my hair and just do like this kind
of big afro Lee curly not like an actual
afro but just like really big or tight
curls that are just like big all over my
head and then I'm gonna maybe do like an
olive green smokey eye for the look you
guys will see in that video if you guys
wanted tutorial on the look I'm sure I
can do that for you but we'll see if I
like it first because I haven't tried it
out yet and I'm just gonna start getting
ready now I'm probably gonna go
downstairs first and make a little bit
of breakfast so yeah let's go do that
and then we can start filming and all
that
the microwave is making some noise but
you want to see a trick
one hand just gonna work
damn go me so I'm gonna turn the heat up
a little bit I'm just making an omelet
it's like my favorite breakfast lately I
just do two eggs two pieces of turkey
bacon already cooked I just put them in
the microwave I know it's a little bit
better tasting if you put it on the
stove and like actually cook them but I
just don't really care so I let that
like cook a little bit and then I'll
flip it and then I'm gonna put a little
bit of cheese yeah delish see this is
the final product I put a little bit of
salt a little bit of cheese on my omelet
and then strawberries tada so I just
finished my hair I honestly think it
looks really fun and cool and completely
different just thought I'd update you
guys I'm filming hi guys so I don't know
the last thing I vlogged I think I was
filming I just filmed a what's in my
purse so that is either up or it's
coming very soon if it's already posted
I'll link it down below
but I just got back from the nail salon
with my mom and I'm stupid and I forgot
to bring out my blog camera even though
it was in my bag but I totally forgot
this is a shade it's OPI I know I should
work out but I'm just so lazy I don't
really want to I am going to the Netflix
Golden Globes after-party tonight with
my mom because as you guys know fuller
house is a Netflix show so she's invited
to that and it's gonna bring me which
will be so fun hair and makeup is coming
a little bit later to get us ready so I
need a shower anyway so that's why I'm
thinking like just work out shower
you're gonna feel so good after I'll
keep you guys posted with what happens
I'm just about to leave my house
it's the next day by the way I kind of
forgot to vlog the rest of my night but
um yeah I'm going to the gym right now
to work out with my trainer I'm not
driving yet don't worry I'm selling my
house but I just thought I'd pick back
up the vlog it is so cold and gloomy out
and it's raining I mean look at this I
gotta go look at there's literally like
rain oh I hate this weather okay so I
just got here I honestly hate driving in
the rain it's so scary it doesn't rain
that much doesn't know how to drive in
the rain so it's just like everyone's
going two miles per hour but we made it
and I'm on time I'm gonna go inside now
and get my ass kicked I just finished my
workout I'm really tired now I pulled
over because no vlogging and driving but
I wanted to show you guys I don't gloomy
it literally is in LA right now so if
you're not from here so I have my
hazards on it's so gloomy I don't know
if I love it or hate it I know I just
said I hated this weather and like the
last clip but gets you in the fields but
it makes you want to snuggle up on the
couch with a boyfriend that hi guys I
don't really remember the last thing I
blog I'm a bit all over the place I'm
home from school right now and I leave
for a trip tomorrow so I just thought I
would vlog like me packing and getting
ready I feel kind of under the weather
right now and it also looks super pale
if you can't tell if a spray tan later
today I'll probably go and get my nails
done at some point basically I just feel
kind of sick I was gonna work out but I
don't really want to I'm like
overheating and then I get the chills
everywhere and then I overheat and then
I get the chills so that kind of sounds
like the flu but I just post mated some
lunch to my house because I literally do
not want to leave I just post mated a
salad some gems on third I actually
don't like dressing fun fact it's so
Chinese chicken salad but instead of the
fried chicken I substitute it with
grilled chicken bomb
so I just got out of the shower as you
can probably tell my skin is it's
literally never this light it's dead
winter in LA but it's actually really
sunny out
it's but it's kind of cold like I can't
really explain it but anyway um it is a
four o'clock right now and waiting for
my sister to get back from her hair
appointment she's getting her hair cut
and then I think we're gonna go get our
spray tans and run a few other errands
before that so again I'm just gonna
bring you guys along I really want to
run to Sephora and grab this blush from
milk and I can't remove the shade name
but it's like a cream blush starts with
an R I think oh it's in the shade rally
it's a cream blush for the shade rally
and I really want to go and grab that so
we're gonna see where the day takes me
I'm just really gonna wait for Bella to
get home and yeah I'll catch up with you
guys a little bit later okay
so right now I'm so home have off my
house yet but I'm about to head out and
hopefully get my eyebrows done they're
looking a little bit crazy so hopefully
they'll have time to go do that and then
I'll get a little manicure pedicure
that's what's on the agenda so I will
see you guys when and get their kids
don't blog and drive kids don't do it
bad things often right so a few things I
just parked and I'm about to run in and
get a spray tan
I normally just turn myself but I don't
know I don't feel that great I kind of
just want to get it professionally done
so we don't have to worry about it or do
it myself tonight so I'm going to this
place called Heather's tanning salon and
I like but this is West Hollywood for
those of you guys wondering it's
literally crazy like the traffic is
non-stop I'm afraid to get out of my car
because it's so bad honestly
pray for me but as you saw I was just
picking out a nail color like the clip
before this was probably being like oh
I'm gonna go with this new color do you
see how my nails are still gray
basically I didn't really look at the
timing my sister is running late from
her hair appointment because she just
got it cut so I have to take her 5:30
tanning spa and I think she canceled the
six o'clock and like reschedule to 8:30
I know it's such stupid issues or it's
not even issues it's just whatever it's
my update in my life right now it's
what's happening so
go get tanned and then hopefully I'll
have time just shoot back to the nail
salon and get my nails done cross my
fingers if not I'm gonna survive it's
fine I guess I could try and do them
myself but I suck okay I'm gonna go this
is the greatest sign I've ever seen
friends don't let friends use
self-tanner I'm tan it's kind of it's
also developed but so I decided to
switch colors I'm gonna go with this one
now it's in the shade lollipop it's like
a little bit more tropical you can see I
have some color to me now it's gonna
develop a little bit more tonight but I
just got back from the nail salon I got
this color here I'll flip it around and
show you I think it's really pretty this
my middle finger completely broke off so
I to cut the whole thing but I think
it's a really fun color especially since
I'm traveling just somewhere with an
ocean and a beach and it's a little bit
more tropical so my Jenna just got here
Bella ordered Mexican food I'm gonna go
eat and then I need a pack really bad
I'm gonna try and pick out outfits for
everyday in there so don't over pack
we'll see how it goes
I'll probably end up throwing everything
in a suitcase but hopefully I can do
that guys hit the motherload the tacos
are lettuce wrapped if you're wondering
what's going on here I want cheese
okay this fridge needs to be organized
it makes me mad
yeah well water what's this music boy
much better wanna say hey you look
pretty
she has our eyelash extensions a fresh
haircut she is ready to go people okay
guys my mom just had some friends over
her co-stars on one call to heart her TV
showing will mark you should watch it
anyway I see a basket of crackers and
I'm like oh my god is there brie cheese
and I was like there was brie cheese
I was like the eighth law and then I
open the fridge and do you see this
that is the slightest amount left but it
makes me so happy that I'm going to get
to have some crackers with brie cheese
actually an idiot
my love for makeup took over and I
started I started swatching eyeshadows
and then my sister goes Livia you have
fake tan on now I have a shadow on and I
think I have to let this stay until I
wash off my tan in the morning well the
pigmentation is incredible
oh so as you can see behind me there
like a bunch of clothes and random stuff
but I really knew a white crop shirt
from one of my outfits and I don't
really ever wear this one it needs to be
short sleeve cropped but it's like the
perfect tightness I don't even know
where this is from so I'm just gonna
attempt to cut this apart this is
probably such a bad idea we're gonna go
for it gotta do what you gotta do so I'm
not gonna cut it too much at first now
for the sleeves can you cut long sleeves
into joy sleeves like is this a thing I
don't buy a little nope this one still
needs to be that morning I feel like I
should probably tie it on first and then
determine if I should cut it short my
hair is crazy frizzy do you guys have
any tips that if you have thick hair
when it dries to get out of the shower
all that stuff to make it like a little
less cray-cray
let me know okay so turns out it
actually worked great cutting skills on
point or cropping shirts um so one of
the nights is like 70s themed disco like
but beachy disco someone wear this white
crop with these super cute just go away
like they're very 70s bell-bottom flare
pants to make your butt look super cute
and then these massive white heels cuz
they're very disco and like a messy
ponytail or like those big curls that I
had in in my last video or something fun
so yeah okay yay
making progress I also have a few other
outfits so this is gonna be my tomorrow
night dinner outfit that's gonna
probably be tomorrow in the day when I
get there I'll change into that I'm like
trying
to write down my outfits so I don't
overpack but the handwriting looks
really messy okay so for the most part I
have everything sorted all of that is
like bra underwear socks workout clothes
pajamas and then that Sunday's outfit by
day Saturday Sunday whatever it doesn't
really matter I have all my outfits
picked out with bikinis and then my two
themed outfits I picked out one of the
nights is a neon night so it's like this
orange ething plaid
pin like matching top and pants it's
from IMG I I'll link it below I'll try
and link these pants they're super cheap
from forever 21 I cut my own shirt yeah
and then I also just want to bring that
like a random little dress it's not like
planned out for any of my days but just
in case like I'm running to the spa or
something just something like cute and
easy to throw on so I'm gonna bring that
and then I'm gonna pack up toiletries so
I think I'm gonna go ahead finish
packing and I will see you guys in a
little bit my tan is getting darker okay
so it's been a little while since I last
picked up the camera as you can see I'm
getting pretty tan I have my suitcase
box with my clothing I think I'm just
gonna pack the toiletries and stuff
tomorrow
I do have school in the morning I'm
going to take a math test love my life
so I'm gonna study a little bit for that
even though it's like literally 11 p.m.
that's me for yeah yeah I already packed
so I'm gonna worry about the toiletries
and the computer and stuff tomorrow
anyway
