Olivia if you're new here make sure to
hit that subscribe button today as you
can tell I'm vlogging but I'm not doing
like a day-in-the-life or a weekly vlog
like normal I'm gonna be doing my night
routine vlog style I feel like I have
grown out of the phase of setting up my
camera and voicing over and doing a
night routine I feel like that's just
really not an accurate representation of
my night so I edited and I'm exporting
this video for tonight and probably
hanging out with my brother and sister
and I also want to mention that this
video is sponsored by hellofresh
and that's also why I wanted to do a
night routine because I feel like it's
just more accurate for that sponsorship
to be in this type of video I'm gonna
talk about hellofresh and everything in
a little bit when I start cooking food
and all that anyway start for the ramble
I'm gonna export it and at this video
nope it's edited I'm not supporting it
and then I'm uploading it and then I'll
see you guys later
I just put some comfier clothing on and
I uploaded the video so I'm letting it
rest I'm not I responded to a lot of the
comments already but usually once my
video goes up and I respond to like the
first few comments and then I just let
it happen let you guys watch and I leave
you alone but I am really hungry at 6:15
my sister's coming home from school
today so I think me her and my brother
are gonna do dinner so I'll vlog that
later but I want to eat a little
something and it's a perfect time to
introduce you guys to hellofresh you
just stuck it in my beautiful fridge I'm
gonna get this out and then let's get to
cooking they give you a little apron of
you and you just unpack it and it tells
you I love to eat it yum yum yum and
then they can see all the nutritional
value and then it's all packaged in here
which I will take out in a second so I
decided I'm gonna make the chicken
cheddar
so he does but I want to give you guys a
little bit of info so here we go
my camera it has low battery and I'm
stressed so first of all hello fresh is
very very very convenient they deliver
literally right to your doorstep which
is amazing you just go online and choose
the delivery date that works for you and
you can also pause your account for a
week set of time if you're out of town
or you're traveling on work or whatever
it is you don't have it like keep coming
to your house you can pause it you can
choose when to come back all the
ingredients are pre measured and they
come in the meal kits and they're
labeled so you know what goes with what
you're not gonna get confused like if
your beef is supposed to go with your
chicken you know what I'm saying if you
mean also it's delivered to your door in
recyclable insulated packaging so that's
good for the environment it comes with
three different options
classic veggie and family classic is
variety of meat fish and seasonal
produce family are quick and easy meals
that basically your whole family is
gonna love veggie is vegetarian recipes
that are plant-based proteins grains and
seasonal protists also the recipes
change weekly so you're not gonna get
bored
no I normally hate cooking but I
actually don't mind when I do it with
hellofresh because everything is so well
organized you feel really confident
because all the recipes are very
strategically and easily outlined for
you so you can see exactly what you need
to do and step by step instruction cards
so that's really helpful if you're dumb
like me I'm just kidding I'm not done
I'm not gonna discredit myself like that
also you get to try things that you
normally wouldn't try you get to cook
things you normally wouldn't eat so you
can get out of your comfort zone a lot
which is amazing especially if you're
picky like me and lastly you just get to
look forward to a big-ass box food
getting delivered to your doorstep and
it's gonna be the highlight of your week
because you're gonna make epic dinners
also thank you guys watch
$30 off your first week of hellofresh
then use the code on via j30 I will have
it right here and hellofresh combo link
it down below I'm gonna make my
I'll be right back because I'm not chef
so I'm not gonna like tutorial this food
like it's just not gonna work for me
okay I'm just gonna really attempt to
make this and I will give you guys small
updates as I go along okay this is what
I'm making the cheddar chicken fajitas

ingredients right here and then you flip
it over and it gives you like literally
all the steps I really think I can do
this okay so it comes to miss open that

and then the chain wait you guys this is
so fun I actually feel like a chef I'm
just reading along and then doing this
stuff very exciting big day for me
this is actually going really well my
chickens and vegetables are cooking I'm
gonna put this in the oven with some
melted cheese just wanted to update you
guys I'm very proud it's super easy to
follow obviously ten out of ten would
recommend finished for the most part but
gorgeous obviously you can make your
presentation a little bit prettier but
I'm gonna make my brother try one I feel
like I have to taste test this for you
guys we go
oh my god there's no way I made that
just surely what I'm here to get my
brother I need you
is it good
why is it so good cuz I'm a chef now go
me you know go it's so really that's
just some of that well you know they
this is actually insane you heard it
here first people it's really good I
know how did this is sure once a week
for my Mexican dish wrong mm-hm
I just ate one of those my brother ate
the other one I feel really accomplished
I feel like I'm approach tough now even
though I didn't really do anything I
just followed directions but I guess it
just show us how easy it is to make the
food I tried not to eat like too much
even though I ate the full thing but
like I'm telling myself I didn't eat too
much because I told my sister I would
get dinner with her when she gets home
to also I think I'm gonna get questions
my brother doesn't live at home he is
grown up and moved out okay I need to
put this olive oil back currently
cleaning my kitchen I'll do a little
cleaning montage tada
so I'm gonna take my face makeup off
right now I'm gonna leave my makeup on
just because it doesn't break me out and
if I'm vlogging I'd rather like look
okay in my vlogs but my face makeup just
honestly I can't have it on anymore and
I just feel like my skin is so iffy
lately like I really feel like I'm just
breaking out a ton I know some people
I'm probably not but to myself like just
annoying to see so I made myself a
facial
I haven't gotten a facial in forever
that'll be really nice I'm gonna use
this to break it down and then I'll
probably just take one of my favorite
look I'll keep this little benefit bath
mat as a side note but then I'll just
take this
and this kind of gets down the rest of
the make up which is nice public per
usual but I'm with the guest hello this
is my night routine Bella so this is
pretty on point with when I gave it my
angel it um cuz we're going to dinner
right now the sushi place that but I
really eat out a lot
so I'll show you guys what I get and you

this what happens when you go to one
restaurant every day your life

Bella to practice because she's gonna
start a chant no just hold my camera I
just see what it feels feel the rush
Bella I don't feel anything I totally
look like an egg we're walking to get

dimension I'm just like a round circle
no you're not don't say that about
yourself we're getting freeze anyway if
you're an avid watcher of my channel you
would know that we get press freeze
too often if I'm not there getting it
I'm post meeting it so sorry I look so
rough well and I this is our ritual
ritual in our nighttime routine so we
get our food and then we get our press
freeze and we sit in my car and have our
sister talks back we're doing right now

night routine I guess right now is

Amelia's livestream with a fan and I'm
so entertained I'm talking my friend
Gracie in the comments I'm not only nice
to meet you

the shower and I'm gonna put this sheet
mask on then lay in bed and reply to
some texts and then dim my lights a
little bit sorry it looks so crazy I can

forehead and my cheek has this
reoccurring breakout I'm gonna put this
on right now and then I'll see you guys

I'm just gonna let
this soaked into my skin for a little
bit and just have my relaxation time I
don't know what I'm gonna do yet public

bathroom because I love her and then
she's gonna look crazy and continue
letting this soak into my skin

skin is looking like it's pretty glowy I
