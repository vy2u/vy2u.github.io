today's video is going to be on this
Valentine's Day inspired makeup tutorial
it got a little smoky on the eyes really
fresh face kind of like smoky Naturals
oh I just got enjoyed it make sure to
subscribe if you do and your thumbs up
if you liked it and me okay first thing
always off before I swear by all fours
just well rule it and literally cannot
look that awful for and then I'm going
to go in with this it's potent eye cream
I see this with keels eye creams that I
was obsessed with I lost in it I don't
know where it went and I just got this
benefit one free to try it out I'll just
make my eyes like literally blow up
going in with my Becca back lit priming
filter this stuff the reason I like a
spine man the reason I love this so much
is because it is you know like instant
luminosity like it's so nice and it
smells good the first thing I can think
of off the top of my head is the one
it's the L'Oreal it's kind of a
different Mac strobe cream L'Oreal
illuminating primer
I can't never up stuff my head course
Mario Badescu rose water spread oh my
god guys think about the cucumber spray
apparently I saw him on Twitter one of
yours tagged me first a little bottoms
so I'm going to get that can be like my
new obsession walk okay so I'm going to
start with the face I'm going to be
taking my Too Faced Born This Way
Foundation this is an old favorite of
mine how do you sit in a while so I'm
just going to apply this with a damp
Beauty Blender I'm gonna spray a little
bit my nose nestled in there um I know
I'm since you got from the a cosmetic CC
cream but I feel like if you're going on
a nice Valentine's Day date you might
want a little bit more
coverage now maybe hoping this Mac as my
neck to darker does it work all licen it
up as we go along don't you worry make
sure to get on your ears as well
sometimes people miss that a little bit
I'm mrs. Bundy hopefully that matches my
next is most part all go in right now
and lighten it up a little bit with some
concealer gonna spring my blunder a
little why I wanted to put a little
damper I'm going to make two concealers
I'm going to take my dress for faith and
the Rimmel one is fair because I think
this is going to be yeah this is just a
little too light for this because I want
to look like white under my eyes I'm
sure the con is like this on all the
high points and then a little like I'm
going in with my naked skin weightless
complete coverage I'm just going to put
like a few swipes on there just pop this
under your eyes I love this you guys I
really want to try it about because I
haven't tried it out yet that la pro
conceal concealer in the shade beautiful
bronze and I am going to cream broad oh
actually Emma this was a little dark
subtle at work I don't know that might
be a little much this looks a little
intense and dark right now but hopefully
it I'm going to spray my brush is a
little Mars back too and then just left
so looks really nice actually
it's put my hair back a little bit
tighter okay so we got that blended out
we're still alive we breathe and we're
living we're chillin cool I'm not going
to go in with this dandelion Dew flashes
might benefit the charge winning it in
so like very rosy pink I'm just sick
with wonder
that's how cute perfect for Valentine's
Day this cream blush I really like this
I want to a short powder bronzing so I'm
going to use my Bobbi Brown bronzer in
the shape golden light this is so
gorgeous and I'm just going to take it
on an angled brush and just kind of go
over where we put that bronzers really
lightly scoops it out a little bit and
then it's going to go in with a little
bit of this hourglass ambient lighting
and powder in the shade dim light I love
this this kind of give you a glow that's
not going to be super intense and I feel
like to Valentine's Day see the date or
something maybe the first date maybe
just with your boyfriend and you just
don't want to have a stark highlight you
just kind of want to be something subtle
this is a very kind of natural kind of
glow so I'm going to go in on just a see
I guess you can use the same brush
actually and just I went on to use this
to set my face that's how subtle it is
so I'm just going to buff out over my
cheeks or a really light glow for my
eyebrows I'm just going to take a little
bit of my Sigma brow powder a little on
a salteena brush and just fill them in
as I normally would I am just going to
skip this part you'll see me with filled
in brows so now that my browser probe in
I am just going to use a little bit of
Vaseline to set the ends of them because
my sister stole my brow gel unlike just
been a little lazy and gotten it back
or bought a new one I'm going to move
out of my eyes so the first thing I'm
going to do is just take a little bit of
my Rimmel stay matte powder and just a
flat brush and just set them with some
powder for the shadows and I'm gonna
zoom you guys being net for the
eyeshadow I'm going to be taking at my
Too Faced semi-sweet bones not not on a
chocolate bar and I'm going to start by
going in with the shade of orange e
shade called peanut butter with a puppet
and on just two sigma e35 and just start
blending that into the crease after that
shade is kind of blended throughout your
crease I'm going to go in with this
darker shade called it truffle and it's
just this dark brown and I'm going in
with this on an e25 which is a little
bit smaller and more precise and I'm
just going to put this kind of in the
crease and outer part of my eyelid this
is just going to add some dimension this
brush makes it so easy
Sigma brushes and then I'm going to go
back in with peanut butter on my
blending brush and just blend that out
I'm going to go in with the shade nugget
or an idiot I know how for now but come
with a purple pink mat I'm going to keep
the eyes mat and except maybe an inner
corner highlight or something out of
them I'm going to take that and apply it
all over my eyelid just it's really not
purple pink and I feel like it's really
raised very wearable supposed to like a
pink shimmer which might not be as
wearable Muffy brush and blend that all
out going back in with that shade nugget
or negative Brown and kapha and I'm just
going to pop more on my lid to make this
a little bit smoky er if you guys want
to stop here I think this is really
subtle not really hello but it kind of
like an easy smokes out Valentine's Day
look but I'm going to take it to the
next level make it smokier I'm gonna
take truffles on a pencil brush and I am
just going to focus it on the outer
corner of my lid and also the inner
corner so see us on this guest
play around with this much as you want
and then I'm just going to take that
hustle brush again with truffled and
bring out my lower lash line keeping it
really close to my lower lash line and
then I'm going to smoke it out Lourdes
peanut butter I just put a little bit of
truffle on my lower lash line and I'm
just going to tap off the excess of
chocolate on the brush I'm going to pick
up peanut butter which is that crease
chain and really just kind of smoke out
the lower lash line after that is done
again on that flat shader brush and pick
up Megan it when you get it remembered
and as we saw on the sender to make it
pop I'm going to lastly take the shade
coconut cream which is just this matte
white here and I'm going to highlight my
brow bone to fill it pop a little bit
I'm also going to take coconut cream and
just place it on my inner corners just
so we bring a little lightness not
covering where we put that dark brown
bring it kind of more towards the inner
part of our so I'm going to go put some
lips false lashes on our gal 810 and I
am NOT going to use the whole thing and
basically just going to take my scissors
and cut them in half and then just use
the end pieces on my eyes so I just
popped on these lashes I cut them in
half and I just stuck them on the end
and then I went in with my voluminous
million lashes by L'Oreal I believe yes
I will and if it goes on my top and
bottom lashes and I realized I was doing
all this like I forgot to set my face
with powder so I'm trying to go in with
my Rimmel stay matte and if used powder
brush and just pack this on my titties
not pack you know what Katie
I'm zenit going to go in with a little
paper brush and just focus bed I'm doing
my eyes I'm lastly just going to take a
little bit of my loosing the bronzer by
NARS because this is really deep and I'm
just going to kind of feel like we don't
have enough color so it's going to pop
it off with a little bit of a lip color
and just going to go in with the Too
Faced lip injection to see it plumping
lip gloss so you guys I think that
concludes it for this kind of smoked out
purple mob
