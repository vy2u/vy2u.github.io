really stressful because we got to the
hotel at like 5:30 but we had to like be
on shuttles and like because you had to
be Mel and I don't examine so it'll be
taking to like a back entrance totes
like they were mobbed or something with
like for literally four other people
sitting like within subs on the water to
do that way yeah it was weird but Jason
Derulo performed and just a bunch of
cool people were there performing all

some magic tricks and he's just really
good on stage which was awesome and I'll
insert some clips I took on my phone

footage from another panel but I just
I'd like you know Costco panel I don't

blogged was I meant so many of you guys
after my panel today and it was like the
best experience of my whole entire life
I'm not even kidding I took some of
these selfies and getting all of them I
look so weird and half of them but it's
okay nameless ml and I are going to go
down okay not true but anyway Mel and I
are going to go down and get to them
food for her cuz she has just been a
sick little duckling in bed all day and
now she's energized she did her hair
shoot or make up an outfit on and we're
gonna go get some food in her system how
what Mel just got a sandwich it's in
that bag well but um it took so long we
have a party to go to so get ready now
and I don't think I'll take oh I'm not
going to change I might change and then
we'll catch you in in a few buy back i
we're just in like resting and laying
low and you know doing our thing i think
i leave tomorrow my camera is about to
die so if it dies out the night i guess
i'll try and blow myself but i just
wanted to show you my outfit really
quick I wore this bodysuit from Planet
blue any shorts from Reformation to my
panel tonight
but for the nighttime I just wanted to
throw on my little coat all that I had
on today but I don't think I'm gonna
wear a hat and then these sneakers that
give me a little higher for misguided I
was going to wear my boots which are
these they're right here but they
honestly just really hurt your feet so
I'm going to take a break from them but
they're pretty cool
a next day
VidCon day 3 the final day into a really
fun party last night
well it was honestly like really fun
anyway so we got back and like - from
this party it was so fun
I took a shower really late and then I
woke up with wet hair that was like out
to here in puffy so it would like put it
all back in a tight line and hope you
can't see it but the makeup is very
minimal which is very highlighted bronzy
I have a meeting in 10 minutes so I'm
probably going to go downstairs now
I can't bring Mel to it so there's
little nail sitting on the floor if
you're getting ready - as I get ready
and then we're going to try and go get
acai bowls or sci-fi it but we're not
allowed it's so annoying the only reason
we came to VidCon is to meet subscribers
and do panels and like have fun with our
subscribers and we can't even I didn't
go analyst falling I think you could too
we're going to try you're also able but
it's like in the middle of convention
center so
