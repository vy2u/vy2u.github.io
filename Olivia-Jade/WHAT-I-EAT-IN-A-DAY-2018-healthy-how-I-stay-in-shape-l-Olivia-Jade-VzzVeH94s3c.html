am a little bit sick but what's up
everyone welcome back to another video
if you're new here I'm Olivia Jade make
sure to subscribe today as you can to
add to title I'm doing a what I eat in a
day I have changed a lot of my eating
habits since this last video which I
will get into a little bit later I'm
pressed on time because I have to go to
school right now so I'm gonna make
myself some breakfast and I just thought
I would show you what I'm eating
so for breakfast I usually make myself
an omelet this is like religious at this
point I usually have this every single
morning so in my omelet I'm very picky
so I just do two eggs some cheese and
Turkey if you don't know how to make an
omelet I'm sure there's a tutorial out
there I can't give one I am pressed on
time ink sorry
okay so I just made my breakfast and
bumpered um I don't know if that looks
appetizing but it tastes really good
also it just really quickly it would
love to mention that the last time I did
this video there was a lot of
controversy around this video because a
lot of people didn't think I was eating
this up and I was counting my calories
too much and I will say I was counting
my calories too much and that was just
not good and I don't recommend doing
that I don't do that anymore
please don't do that it's really not
healthy and you will make yourself crazy
but it is so don't think I'm getting
enough I'm gonna eat what I eat until
I'm full I'm 18 I don't need adult
youtubers you know the icon young
children saying they're helping them
okay sorry
shade is real but yeah I'm gonna eat
this thanks I hope you enjoyed this
video I love you guys so much I know I'm
very awkward about addressing hate but
yeah I also always make sure to drink a
lot of water throughout my day like a
lot fellas dying in have to take my and
biotic cuz I'm straight out I'm gonna
take my golly I'm gonna go to school and

time I'm hungry

I'm just gonna make myself a snack hold
me over for the next two and half hours

butter I'll show you guys this is my
favorite almond butter so I'm gonna have
some of this with an apple and then I'm

at school I posted it to my house cuz
I'm too lazy to cook and I'm just gonna
add half an avocado to it and then I
will show you guys the final product
okay so this is lunch I just added half
an avocado but it's chicken lettuce
avocado cheese sometimes I do bacon

eater I also don't use dressing this
literally is not for health choices I
hate the taste of it hi everyone so it's

face okay okay I'm really trying to
speak right up I ordered some food

tomato sauce and cheese so it's like my
own version my healthier version of
