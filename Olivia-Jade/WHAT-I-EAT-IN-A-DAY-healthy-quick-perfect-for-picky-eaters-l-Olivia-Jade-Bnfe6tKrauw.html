to my youtube channel in today's video
I'm doing a what I eat in a day I
usually eat pretty clean especially
since I ate full pizza last night I'm
feeling pretty full still but it's
important to treat yourself so the new
day I'm not dwelling on it how to eat
better today and try and get a workout
in I got in a car crash yesterday
Oh my body's kind of sore and my head
hurts that'll be in an upcoming vlog or
happen to be vlogging that day and then
I got in a car crash and so you'll hear
more about that then but for now let's
figure out what I'm going to eat for
breakfast
so this is the brand to use for my toast
and they're only 100 calorie or it's
only 100 calories for one loaf and it
tastes really good so I usually just do
this and then I do a little peanut
butter and banana and it's super good
it's just a little coat so that's what
I'm going to have for breakfast this is
the peanut butter I like using it's
organic it's only peanuts and salt so
it's no added sugars or extra
ingredients that are just kind of
unnecessary okay so this is what half
the REC ffice I have a little bit of
peanut butter banana toast and then I
have a cup of hot water with lemon
because it's really good for your
metabolism and then just cold water
so it's one o'clock right now and this
is what I'm having for a snack and I ate
at like 11 and 15 so I'm not super
hungry but some time going to
appointments and stuff I feel like I
should eat
spread I'm using its days killer bread
60 calories for one piece I'm having two
pieces it's organic I'm humming this
Turkey we get fourth leg low-sodium
Turkey really thin slice oh I know how
to do this thank you
Pro just slicing it this probably isn't
the prettiest thing which you've ever
seen I don't really know how to make the
avocados look nice but I just used two
pieces of that bread a few slices of
turkey and then half an avocado for both
of those so how can all de kado does get
you a lot and then a glass of water and
that's village to test it actually
really good
so I'm getting a little bit hungry it's
my 6:20 and the last thing I ate was
lunch at 3:00 and I've been like pretty
full
I was really filling actually when I
first ate it and then when I came
upstairs and I was just chilling
drinking a little water I still felt a
little hungry and then I did like a
quick 5 minute workout and it took a
workout in five minutes where you burn
100 calories I don't know if it's your
not but I'll link it down below and I
felt and ever since then I felt really
full so I think if you ever feel hungry
right after just give your body like a
moment just keep waiting it out for like
10 minutes especially if you just say it
like full lunch just a little tip but I
think I'm ready for dinner I have an
appointment at 7:30 for eyelash
extensions um so let's go eat
it's about 6:30 right now and I'm having
an apple I literally have no idea what I
want for dinner so I might just eat this
and then get something to eat after my
eyelash appointment but that's how do we
do like mine I should eat now but
literally nothing sounds good that I
have in my house so this sounds okay so
we should have an apple I don't know
what I want on okay so I think I thought
I just had an apple but since I have an
appointment at 7:30 I'm having like a
little bit Oh cashews I don't really
know and then these little brown nice
rice crackers
so it's been a little while since I had
that snack I was out like 6:45
it's about 9:15 and I just got home from
my appointment as you can hear in the
back and boiling waters but I'm really
not hungry I kind of smashed a lot
throughout the bed you're like and my
meals were pretty big for myself at
least they filled me up a lot so I'm
just going to have a little bit of
oatmeal I just use this breakfast for
dinner my eyes view this kind and it
says one packet is about 190 calories
I'm probably just going to use about
half of the pack because as I said I'm
not hungry enough to eat a bunch of food
right now like I'm kind of full but I
know that I'm like hungry full like I
want some food but you're starving calms
down a little bit
don't look so with water in a banana
it'll be amazing I already ate a banana
stay but I'm obsessed with bananas
Hey so this is dinner hi I was trying to
figure out how to make it look prettier
and Tyler told me to put cinnamon on it
and I kind of overdid it I usually put
cinnamon on my oatmeal just not this
much but I just chopped up like a small
banana I do how I have half a packet and
then a little bit of cinnamon and I'm
also going to drink some water that is
it for what I eat in a day it might be a
lot to some people it might be a little
of some people but I just kind of listen
to my body and eat until I'm full so I
recommend doing that um because I'm no
nutritionist I don't know what I'm
supposed to eat but I hope you guys
enjoyed it thanks for watching and I'll
see you my next video bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
