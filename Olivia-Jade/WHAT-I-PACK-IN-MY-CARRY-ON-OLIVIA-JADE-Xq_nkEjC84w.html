I'm filming as you can tell by the title
of what I keep in my carry-on travel bag
this video is pretty requested for some
reason I I liked watching these too I
guess I love watching kind of like the
what's in my bag tag all that so this
was requested and I was super excited to
film it and I hope this helps you out if
you need some ideas or you don't know
what you're packing your carry-on you
don't want to make it too heavy but you
want to bring the necessities and all
that so I'm just going to get right into
it and I hope you enjoy okay so this is
the bag that I use for my carry-on it is
from Urban Outfitters if I can find the
link I will link it down below per usual
but I'm just going to kind of start
pulling things out um which I keep in my
carry-on and the first and like just the
bulkiest thing in there is my makeup bag
I do keep my makeup bag in my carry-on
because they're my babies and if it's
just a quick trip then I like just
having it all with me instead of getting
it lost maybe in my other bag like my
actual suitcase I just kind of keep like
some foundations concealer brows mascara
just the basics and this is a Too Faced
Born This Way natural beige this one
matches when I have a tan which I'm
gonna tan myself tonight
thank God and then I also I'm just
having my normal shape which is nude so
just bringing both in case and they're 1
fluid ounce so they can be carried on I
don't know what the exact I think that's
for blue top this is when you can't
carry it on the next thing that I see it
is my philosophy purity made simple
one-step facial cloths this is such a
necessity for me to bring my bag because
it removes makeup as well as cleanses
your skin and I'm not about to bring in
my purse my skincare stuff I kind of put
that in my suitcase so this is just
really great I'm tired of having makeup
on if I just want it to all come off if
I'm over it if I'm over it if I just
want my makeup to come off this comes in
handy real nicely because I can just
remove my makeup and they're super super
easy they have a little
there's an open price I have my computer
I just have my MacBook Pro and this is
especially necessary for me to have in
my travel bag because I like to edit
videos when I'm on the plane um I don't
like being unproductive when I have such
a long flight ahead of me or even just
an hour to flight I like just getting
stuff done so having my computer with me
is so important
I like downloading movies but I really
do try and get my editing out of the way
with because you don't need Wi-Fi for
that and it's just that extra time that
you could be doing something so why not
make use of it you know I next this is
kind of new but I have printed out a
calendar I will try and link this down
below as well if I can find the website
but it's a free printable calendar what
I've been doing is I've just kind of
been planning out when I'm posting what
videos are posting um all that so I
haven't filled out the month of August
yet and I'm just trying to plan around
when I can pre film when I can start my
back to school series next in my
carry-on I always keep a pack of gum
this must be empty from last trip I also
keep my Smith's rosebud solve or solve
it and I know um little lip go up and
what is this chopstick lip balm tube
they also have an intern actual tin can
which I shot when I was super little it
was like my favorite thing but I used to
always kiss the can I don't know why but
you got really hard to open so this is
just so much easier to carry along and
just kind of rub on your lips I also
keep some Sony's Too Faced sent me these
I keep a headphones now have a vid :
awesome is TV pass
I keep whiteout this must have been in
there I don't know why maybe - you know
if I mess up on my little calendar going
along with my little calendar I also
keep a highlighter because I highlight
the day I have to post I have a cross
mark when I finish what I've done and a
pen to write and what I've done so this
goes hand-in-hand with my cute little
calendar this is the most important
thing I move AG it's a deodorant and
it's the KY a light blend of lettuces
it's the KY by gage straws it's this
all-natural deodorant and it smells so
amazing and I found that if you keep you
and your purse you never have to worry
again and lastly in my carry-on bag to
things like only hand in hand are my
blog camera and my vlog camera charger I
like to evolve on vacation especially
when I'm going somewhere different far
from home I think it's really cool just
talk about the blog camera and kind of
just make a travel diary for your
memories so I'll be vlogging hopefully a
lot of my trip if I'm not distracted and
then of course I need my charger so I
can continue blogging with my camera
dies so that is the quick little video
of what I keep in my carry-on bag if you
guys have any suggestions that saves
your life when you're traveling to keep
in your carry-on bag then comment it
down below so maybe I can add it to my
and yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this
little chitchat what I could my carry-on
I love you guys so much and I will see
you guys next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
