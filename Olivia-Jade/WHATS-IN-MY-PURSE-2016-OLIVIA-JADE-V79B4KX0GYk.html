a surprise to you in my bag if I just
dig in the first thing I see is my phone
obviously I have business iPhone 6s plus
my screen savers a pink brick wall found
on Pinterest and I have this little case
from so Nick source onyx it's definitely
small nice it just this cute little lips
all over it I've had this forever but of
course I keep my phone in my purse goes
everywhere with me and then I have a
wallet this is from comme des Garcons
which have like you know I'm gonna open
it because I would be the one to like
show my license or something by accident
but
super cute black kind of big so that's
it like fits in here but if I had like
any smaller of a purse I would probably
need to like chop my wallet in half scar
keys I have a little um it looks like a
little UGG boot I don't know um I have a
little skull key I have a little tassel
that says that it's a very initial
somewhere on it I guess it doesn't and I
have this faux fur pom-pom thing with a
little face in it
what else do I keep oh I have some lip
balm I always kissed this stuff because
I don't like to take my fingers and
stuff like feels weird this is my beauty
counter lip conditioner in peppermint I
love this smell and perfect for the
winter because of peppermint flavored
and the lik Christmas and a little can a
little container could I love this next

a commentator which I did to sponsor
video for a while back but I do keep ki
Australia sunglasses I guess I lost the
container I don't know what the style of
these are I just found them in my room

bought them we like share something we
don't we don't share sunglasses I think
I bought these at Topshop

things away stuff in my purse I have a
buck some lip gloss in the shade White
Russian I'll put some on I love this
