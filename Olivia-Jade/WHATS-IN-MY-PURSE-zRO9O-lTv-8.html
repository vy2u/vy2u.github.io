I'm doing a very requested video so my
two top videos that are like like
everybody's like please do please do
please do
room tour and then what's in my bag so
I'm doing it what's in my bag quick
disclaimer number one is that I stuffed
my bag to the max like I should probably
carry a bigger bag but I love the size
of small purses I think it's your Sophie
because I'm so small but since I am a
smaller person the bag kind of fits me
veterans that are coming with a large
purse and smaller bags tend to be a
little less expensive even though this
one is really really expensive still so
that's got and that's I was also debate
debating doing this video was because I
don't want to get comments and if you
brought you have that purse blah blah
blah blah because it is a really really
nice curse I mean in all fairness it's
not my purse it's my mom's purse I just
kind of swiped it and have been using it
she doesn't carry it too often I am
carrying around currently the saline
Nano and it's just like cream and the
Navy and then brown on the sides it is
really expensive I don't expect anybody
to go out and buy a saline there are so
many knockoffs Aline's too
so yeah that being said let's jump right
into the video and I hope you guys enjoy
it let's start with the obvious
achievement versus my phone I have the
iPhone 6s plus I love the phones I think
it's easy to watch YouTube videos on I
think it's easy to Instagram Twitter all
that good stuff um I just love a big
phone so I should probably put a case on
it I love using my case back there it
was my last video that everybody's
asking where it's from
it's on Amazon I'll put the link down
below if you want to get it I have my
car keys I have this fluff ball I have
no idea where it's from but you can
literally get like to those fluff balls
from Amazon I carry around advil 20
I don't know why that's in there right
now next I have my key Australia
sunglasses these pink ones I've been
wearing lately um not my favourite but
they do I have a choker because
obviously I'm strangely enough on my
blog camera I don't know why I buy my
first I usually never carry this around
my vlogging camera I use the canon g7x
this is super random I'm a toothbrush I
tend to brush my brows because sometimes
we'll end up sleeping at places that I
didn't need to sleep at like if I that's
sounds so sketchy definitely do it me
like that like this rarely happens but
if I'm just like at my friend's house
and then like I'll just look like will
Chaves it okay then I'll just have to
brush I mean like I don't really know
why this isn't me I'm just guessing
that's a reason but like I don't really
remember to take pressure my purse I
have my wallet of course this is a or
sister or anything this is comb doing
our song yeah I think it is I have some
tweezers these are Revlon these are the
best tweezers ever I know that sounds
weird but like what if your eyebrows you
don't have time to get them done you
just want to be like a little pluck I
have so much chapstick
this is the lip smackers they went out
of business so my sister and I stopped
off online so I'm a bit Swagger's before
they went out of business I've got two
lipsticks this is revlon colorburst 0:01
honey
juice and then I also have the Bobbi
Brown creamy matte lip color in crushed
plum the Maybelline New York lash
sensational mascara I don't remember why
this was in here I really do love this
mascara its drugstore it's just a
classic in this purse there is a like
side pocket there
I like the actual saline card there's a
shoulder strap that you can take off
it just has like little hooks and then
you just unclip it and then
it's just a little cute purse but I love
this because I like cross body bags so
yeah looks like that my so yeah was
attempted to be an Australian accent
also inside a keep town home sorry if
it's to your mind I think I think I'm
good at it right that's basically only
from oh we have anything in the front
