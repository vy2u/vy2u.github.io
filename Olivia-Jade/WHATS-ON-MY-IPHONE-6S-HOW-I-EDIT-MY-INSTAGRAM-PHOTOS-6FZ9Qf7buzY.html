sorry it's been a little while since
I've posted um what is my excuse oh this
is actually pretty valid my camera broke
um so I was using a Canon t5i before I
am now filming on my Canon 70d and I
just used the 1855 milliliter millimeter
lens not milliliter currently I only
have one softbox on me and then the rest
on this side is natural lighting so I'm
sorry this side is darker or if my the
natural lighting is better than the
softbox lighting my bulb went out my
other softbox and I was trying to and I
grabbed a new one because I like had an
extra one in my closet I like tried to
grab the extra one and I was getting
really frustrated because it wouldn't
screw into the softbox and the bulb
exploded and the whole thing shattered
in my hand so luckily I'm okay but so
yeah we are not going to be using that
because I physically can't as you can
tell by the title I'm doing a what's on
my iPhone at 6s plus I have this giant
phone it is amazing I've had this for
probably like a year now I don't have
bad eyes or anything but I just like
love having a big phone to watch videos
on to edit I don't end it on my phone
but to edit my Instagram photos and like
all that kind of stuff so if you guys
want to know what I keep on my iPhone I
don't know why I've like never been a
fan of watching these types of videos
just because I've made they don't care
to see what people have on their phone
but this is like the most one of the
most requested videos and I did this a
while while back like when I first kind
of started YouTube and I haven't done it
probably for a year and a half so this
is very updated I can't believe how fast
time flies but if you guys want to know
what's on my iPhone 6 what is it
6s Plus then just keep watching so the
first thing is I open my phone and it's
my screen saver I just got this off of
tumblr um it's like these taxis in New
York City I thought it was really pretty
so I just log in and then the first
thing I see are just kind of the
standard things that come with the phone
I'm not going to go over every single
thing that is on my phone just because
it comes on the iPhone you guys can just
take a look I'm just going to like
briefly kind of run through what
use all my first page calendar I don't
use photos and camera obviously go hand
in hand if you guys don't have an iPhone
or just kind of want one you don't know
what it is camera it has really good
camera quality on your phone you can
take videos you can take pictures and
yeah it's great and then photos is just
where all the photos are kept and I have
weather I don't use this that often but
if I want to know what to wear and I
want to know the weather I'll just click
on that clock I use that for my alarm so
I have like so many different alarms set
on my phone then I have maps I never use
that um videos I don't even know what
that is
wallet do not use notes I sometimes use
this for video ideas or if I have like
an appointment I'll just write down like
the name of the place and the time just
cuz I don't really know how to use my
calendar up like I have it on my phone
but it's like very confusing for me I
don't know why so I just I like writing
it down in notes it's a lot easier for
me about the facial and I booked it like
a month in advance times I'll go in on a
facial and then when I'm leaving and
paying I'll just book my next one so
basically I just write all that down
there
reminder stalks I don't use itunes store
is just where you can purchase um music
for TV or movies then app stores where
you can purchase apps and for most of
you that have iPhones you obviously know
all this I'm just kind of going over
this for those that don't have iPhones
or want to buy one iBooks I don't use
news I don't use health I don't use and
settings just has all your general
settings I'm not going to like go into
my settings and stuff but I hope that
that doesn't bug you have too much then
I have folders I started and organized
my phone for this or anything I am just
I don't like my apps all over the place
I like them to be sectioned off in
folders so the first one is social I
have snapchat Instagram Twitter and then
Facebook this is just a private Facebook
I never use Facebook I basically only
have Facebook because in high school
that's kind of like at least in LA
that's how parties work the host makes a
Facebook event and then invites people
so that's basically the only reason I
have a Facebook but I literally never
use it but I do a snapchat which I use
all the time my snapchat is Olivia j-3 I
am I
gram which you guys can follow me Olivia
G 1 2 3 and I have my Twitter which is
Olivia Gina Lee I would like all three
of those names to be Olivia Jade but
those are taken so I'm working on trying
to get them because really would like
just to all be oviya Jade that'd be so
much easier but it's not really FaceTime
I basically only faced on my boyfriend
and boomerang which it's like comes on
the instrument thing now it's like those
moving pictures the next folder I have
is travel in my travel folder I have
ways and this is what I use to navigate
my like directions and everything this
is how I get around town when I'm
driving this is what I use then I have
uber if you guys don't know what uber is
where have you been it's a car service
that you can just call a car for
yourself that's just post mates I love
this this is basically if you guys don't
know what this is it I don't believe
it's in all states like ubers and a lot
more locations than post mates but post
mates is in LA I know it's in New York
it's an amazing app where these people
you can order food or like order
something from CVS and these people will
pick it up for you it's kind of like
uber you call your post mates you put in
what you want and then they'll go to
this location pick up what you want and
deliver it to the address you put in so
it's like personal assistant it's
amazing and then I have glam squad which
is an app where I think hair and makeup
artists like come to your house and do
your hair makeup and it's super
convenient and easy I've actually never
tried it I'm afraid to let random people
into my house to do my hair and makeup
but I have it then but I'll probably
never use it just because that freaks me
out
I have editing which I have facetune
vsco cam and after light these are the
three apps I use to edit Instagram
photos I everybody always asked how I
edit my Instagram photos and it's
nothing too complex or crazy but I will
show you a little example of what I do
oh my god these leaf blowers stop it
filming man
good good I don't really know what to do
about this okay well we're just going to
roll with it so I have my editing and I
use space to nabisco and after that I
don't normally use facetune to edit my
body but sometimes if I like my skin
looking a little oily I'll smooth it out
or like if I have a pimple I'll just
like erase it and face trip I don't
think it's good to like completely abuse
the use of face gym just because people
can totally make themselves look totally
different which is kind of scary but
yeah I mostly just use it to like smooth
out a spot on my skin I like a race of
pimple what you I think it's okay
everybody has their days I don't do this
picture of my mom because I think is
adorable and she definitely doesn't need
a lot of smoothing or anything like what
I do a face you but I'll basically just
choose the smooth app and let's say I
think her forehead needs a little
touch-up go like that that's basically
all I do on face June and then I just
save it to my camera roll I sometimes
use after light for like saturation and
brightness but now that Instagram has
that in their editing system I never use
after light so then I just go straight
into vsco cam and I have I'm guilty I
have bought all the vsco cam filters so
basically what I do is I just edit it
and then I have all the different
filters I can just choose whichever I
like I don't have a specific way I like
see one I like see three I like a one is
so so nice as well it just really
depends what kind of photo you're
editing and I also love hb2 for like a
darker effect so for this I probably use
c3 just because it looks the most
natural or a1 I'm going to use c3 so
basically you can click on it and then
you can adjust the intensity of the
filter I'm going to go up to for this
photo about 10 which is like on the
higher side it goes 1 through 12 and
then you can go into your tools and
start to mess around with the colors the
brightness the contrast all that so I
usually like to take the brightness down
but since this photo is a little bit
older so it's already kind of has that
like rigid II feel to it I'm going to
bring the exposure up one and then I'm
also bring the contrast up one so then I
just saved that to my camera roll and
that's basically what I like to do for
that and then I go to games and I have
baseball sixteen so weird I baseball
Kylee Triller dubsmash and Sephora let
me start with baseball because a lot of
you are probably confused why like this
girl that puts on makeup all the time
has a baseball app you know it's a good
question I don't think that it's a boy
thing only I think girls are allowed to
have these 40 apps - but the real reason
why I have this is because whenever I'm
laying on the couch with my boyfriend
we're watching the movie he's always
holding up his phone
I'm like that's not sure if he's usually
good about watching movies but if we're
just like hanging out like talking
watching movies kind of like
multitasking up we're both on our phones
he'll be playing this baseball app and
I'm always like so basically what you do
is see okay I can play my boyfriend
right now
so I play him and what I do is like okay
I'm going to show you here and not on
the other view that I've been using so
he like pitches it to me and I hit it oh
I'm bad I also have Kylie next to it
kind of locked me out I was paying for
my subscription and now it's not letting
me play anymore
it's think I think it's because I was
using a credit card that's now expired
so I have to read ree-ree log back in
three what you call put a new credit
card hello then I have Triller
which is where you can make little
videos out of music I'm not really going
to go into depth but I'm sure there's
trailer tutorials on YouTube it's super
basic and easy to figure out and then I
have dubsmash which is that awkward like
has like famous cultural movie or song
and you can just lip sing it I'm sure
you guys all know what does smashes and
then I have the Sephora app and then
next I have music in music I don't
really use these too much SoundCloud and
Spotify sometimes I use Spotify if I'm
like using other people's music and then
Soundcloud I rarely use um and then I
have my YouTube folder so first I have
this thing called bitly I thought how I
pronounced it at least and basically if
the reason I have this as if I'm saying
hey guys like go check out my new
YouTube video my link is in my Instagram
bio I can paste the link on my video
into this app and it shortens the link
for me and then I can put that in my bio
and it will tell me how many people have
clicked on my link in my bio and gone to
my YouTube page so it kind of just helps
if you have a youtube or a blog or
something so when you post about it you
can see oh how many people actually do
look at my Instagram and go to that page
and then how many people just naturally
go to that patron subscribing to me or
whatever so that's what I use that for
it and then after that I have studio
which is this app for youtubers that is
incredible I'm not going to go into it
because I don't like say my revenue and
stuff and I'm not comfortable with that
but it has comments it has how much
money you've made on a video it has you
can edit your description you can upload
from this up next I just have the
YouTube app which you guys know what
that is I just can watch videos on there
and then I have Pinterest this is under
YouTube because sometimes I get video
ideas from Pinterest or something
inspires me on Pinterest like a DIY or
something and then I have a school I'm
about to save your life kids I'm
literally about to save your life this
app is called photo math and basically I
do not condone cheating if this is on a
test do not use this but sometimes if
you're stuck on a homework problem with
this app you can scan the actual math
problem or what you can do is just type
in the math problem and then it just you
press go or whatever and it just shows
you how to do all the word I wouldn't
use this app to just like feel like
you're tricking your teachers because in
the end you're probably just hurting
yourself but if you also have one or two
homework problems or like a lesson that
you don't understand this might help you
out next I have calculator which just
comes with a gun love this app it's
great and then Doc's which is just an
app version of Google dome then I have
productivity I don't really know
to call this and I didn't really know
what to put in it so the first off I
have is called control for a lot of you
are not going to care for this app
because it basically just hooked up to
my house and what I can do is if I'm
lying in bed I can turn my lights off in
my room or like in my bathroom or I can
turn the TV on with this app it's
amazing if it's connected to your house
but if it's not you're not going to care
for this out um
next I have Safari then I have a third
page and this page is my least favorite
page and this is just that these are
just the apps that come on my iPhone I
compass I never use tips never use voice
memos we actually really love boys
members I really love because this is
how I do voice overs for YouTube
then I use contacts whatever I never
really go to that um I just like text or
like use the actual phone app I then
have fine friends yeah so five friends
is just like a tracking device I don't
know find iPhones another tracking
device you can just like find your phone
or computer with this I have game center
which I never use I hate it I wish I
could delete it I don't use podcast and
I don't use watch because I don't have
an Apple watch lastly to finish it off
on my bottom row I have my phone my
messages my mail and then I have music
which is just iTunes um which I just use
all my music for in the car that's it
for the work on my iPhone video I hope
you guys enjoyed it this is so highly
requested and that's basically it
so thank you so much for watching I love
you guys and I'll see you guys in my
next one bye mmm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
