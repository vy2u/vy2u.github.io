my channel today I'm filming a Q&amp;amp;A and I
asked you guys to ask me some questions
on Twitter using the hashtag asked
Olivia Jane I really miss just doing
like a sit-down Q&amp;amp;A because I've just
been doing so many makeup videos and
beauty stuff so I'm just glad to have
this moment because my channel is kind
of going back to beauty again so we're
gonna keep like that cuz I really enjoy
doing giddy but you know I'm saying you
know yeah first question is when did you
start wearing makeup
oh I started wearing makeup when I was
in seventh grade I believe when Bar
Mitzvah and bought Mitzvah season kind
of came around and that's when I first
started wearing makeup and it was super
awkward because I would dress really
preppy to like all these varmints was in
vomits let me check if I still have an
old dress from one of them I gave those
old dresses away to like Goodwill but I
would dress him like j.crew like really
preppy high like crew-cut song and
jaycara I would dress in like the kids
section Crewcuts which is like super
prep like high neck like dresses that
like flare out and I would wear like I
didn't know how to do makeup so I would
just do like a dark like black kohl
eyeliner smudged underneath my lash line
just the bottom lash line not even the
top and make me look like my eyes were
shut the whole night and that's all I
would wear so I look super kind of dark
up here in them like all colorful down
and my outfit it was such an interesting
getup I had I don't know what's the
funniest cheesiest joke you know um one
time Oh guys this is not funny but my
friend Jack's really funny so anything
he says kind of funny sorry I'm about to
say this and ruin your life ask me if
I'm a tree
I would pretend you two said are you
achieve no that's the joke and I laugh
so hard I think it's really not funny
thing about it and the way I just said
it just made it 10 times less funny
because I'm not a funny person
so is your hair naturally that color or
do you get highlights it's so pretty
thank you and matter actually is this
color I haven't dyed my hair gotten
highlights before a lot of people in my
hair care routine asked me what dye
number of my hair was because a lot of
you guys wanted to know and I'm so sorry
I haven't dyed my hair this was just
from the Sun so I don't have a hair dye
color if I ever dye my hair I will be
sure to let you guys know I just I don't
know a lot of people told me not to dye
my hair so I'm not dyeing it yet what
would happen if Pinocchio said my nose
is about to grow right now
I guess his nose would grow right or
would he be lying
cuz Pinocchio's lying so if he's like my
nose is about to grow right now but he's
lying his nose wasn't about to grow
right now but then he would be lying so
his nose would grow so either way his
nose would grow oh yeah then you do a
room and closet tour you know I've
really been thinking about it and I
think I'm 5050 there is a lot of reasons
why I don't want to do that just because
it's like my personal space and stuff
but I know it is a really popular video
on YouTube and I don't think it's cuz
you guys are trying to invade my space
or anything I just like like having
privacy you know so not on 100% no at
all like the chances are high I'll
eventually do one just my room isn't
really how I'd like for you guys to see
it right now so not right now but maybe
in the near future not for a little
while I don't think you know it's old
news but what color is the dress oh
please don't even get me started about
that that dress is the most confusing
thing ever since I just think there's
something really good here thing hold on
ever since math class what or Spanish
class because I don't really understand
that either honestly the person that
decided to take that picture and mess
with all of our minds
good job girl you really got us I'm
gonna say the color is both what is one
thing on your bucket list
one thing I bucket list is either
skydiving because that's a dream of mine
and ever since I was really little or
sticking my feet in that thing with a
bunch of little fish that eyo the dead
skin off your feet that's disgusting but
it's a dream of my favorite new movie my
favorite new movie if you're a little
bit younger I would not suggest this
movie until you're a little bit older
and I know that's tempting and now you
want to watch it but just trust me it's
gonna go straight over your head if
you're like don't really understand some
stuff yet but the first time is a great
movie and it's not a new movie but I
only saw it for the first time yesterday
even though those meetings are really
different but I thought with my friend
Lily yesterday I'm Clara and rocky and
it is so good I just cried oh favorite
spring outfit so my favorite spring
outfit lately has been those flowy
beachy pants you know what I'm talking
about I have a picture right here I have
a pair of these and they're just flowy
white beach pants and then I like
wearing them with the crop top and like
bohemian kind of strappy sandals can you
do oot DS or OTW yes I will be doing a
lot of outfit videos really soon I'm
sorry for making you guys all wait but
they're coming I swear I just haven't
had anybody film them for me so it's
kind of hard but I'll figure it out I
promise
can you do a nighttime routine yes I'll
film that video tomorrow so that'll be
really really soon yes
iron crate glass hey girl why did the
chicken cross the road please tell me I
think that chicken cross the road to get
to the other side I've heard the chicken
why Leah's costanera got hit by a car
I've also heard something about stepping
on gum but I think the real reason why
the chicken crossed the road was because
there was a huge TV on the other side of
the road where when calls the heart was
playing
and the chicken wanted to see it yeah
it's go me I was a great answer and last
I'm going to finish off with Candace
Cameron Bure raised questions I don't
know why I said your full name I
apologize I'm going to finish off with
Candace's question why aren't you in bed
oh wait 10:30 on Saturday night clearly
I'm just old like night this question
was my first question it made me laugh
really hard I am in bed technically just
not sleeping you're not old Candice
you're just tired which I respect
because you've worked all day I'm sure
wait do you work Saturdays probably
