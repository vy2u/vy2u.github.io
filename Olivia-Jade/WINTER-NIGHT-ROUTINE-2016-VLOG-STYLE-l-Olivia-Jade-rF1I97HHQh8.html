tutorial on this messy bun I don't know
if it will already be up it might have
gone up yesterday um but I'm doing my
winter night routine vlog style I've
never done this before I wanted to try
it out
especially with vlogmas anyway as I was
saying is I'm doing a winter night
routine blog style my dogs barking
because it's way more realistic I'm now
going to wash my face take off the
makeup I put on to film that video
because I am going to work out I'm
taking up all my makeup and now that
that's done almost please hold
I am going to put my workout sports bra
and top on let me show you already on my
workout pants on because they are so
cool now I'm gonna grab a sweatshirt to
put on so I'm not just like driving
around a Sports Bra you know by being
somewhat what do you want dinner honkers
okay go eat
rebel we have to go gonna work out now
woo back again
have you seen the Victoria's Secret it's
so cute as we are on the way to a
workout class what shocked my face I
mean when I danced
on'y
go bad neither one knows we're here we
made it and we're parking now we're just
getting in Bella's car and we're gonna
go home and make some dinner yeah see
you then I just got out of the shower
I'm feeling really clean now then i'ma
go downstairs and make dinner I'm gonna
make my famous tacos okay so for dinner
I'm gonna make famous tacos that are
really easy but obviously you can't eat
this if you're vegan but if I do have
like vegan ground turkey like fake
ground turkey I bet it could work oh you
can do what it's all toe Fergie I don't
like that name for some reason a little
bit of like olive oil spray to spray on
your Pam I like to use corn tortillas
because they're a little bit better for
you then flour you need taco seasoning
just like that so then the meat doesn't
stick like get the ground turkey and
then just make it into little pieces
this looks disgusting right now but it's
actually so good okay so this is what it
should look like
like all cooked through and then what
you're going to do is get a cup of water
and you're seasoning dump this in all
the taco meat and then your cup of water
oh I'm spilling because I'm trying to
vlog like that and then what you do is
you just mix it in I turned it to the
lowest simmer because um if you like let
it cook too much it will dry it out
because it will absorb all the water and
you want it to be like JC you know what
I mean so I'm gonna get some cheese
there done you could put lettuce avocado
whatever but I'm really picky
should I have well looks like I don't
eat anything
I know this is what phallus generates a
hub for Dulce it's five
we're not yeah yeah hey guys so I am
downstairs in my YouTube room and I am
going to edit 20 editing it is only four
minutes but I'm not going to watch it
