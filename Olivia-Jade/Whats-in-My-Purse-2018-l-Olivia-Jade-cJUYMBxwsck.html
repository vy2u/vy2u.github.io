back to another YouTube video as you can
tell by the title I am kicking it back
I'm doing something a little bit more
old-school on YouTube I guess you could
say I feel like with everything that's
going on on YouTube right now a lot of
people just need some older YouTube
videos to come back so if you're an OG
youtuber that I used to watch before I
was someone on YouTube this video was
probably inspired by you because it's a
what's in my purse these used to be like
crazy popular on YouTube and I haven't
done one in a really long time so if you
guys want to see what I took my purse
then just keep watching also if you guys
are new here please don't forget to
subscribe
I've been doing this new thing actually
only did it one other video but I think
it's fun so I give you guys five seconds
to try and subscribe and you can't if
you beat the clock so here's the timer
go hopefully you did it if not it's okay
anyway let's get started and if you guys
enjoyed this video okay so the purse
I've been carrying around is this black
bag from Gucci this is my mom's purse
actually I wanted to her closet and
stole it so I have to give it back to
her but the reason I wanted to use this
purse like recently is because I have a
lot of purses but they're all like
really small and they don't fit anything
in them so I think I'm gonna invest in a
nice purse
a nice big purse and I think I might get
not maybe not this exact same colors and
she has it so I could always just borrow
it to like that's always money but like
something similar I'm obsessed with bags
from Gucci I'm gonna link something down
below or some other bags that I think
are spacious and really gorgeous that
are not designer because I know not
everyone can just drop money on a purse
like this and I'm not trying to bribe
bank Oh look like I can do that honestly
I just really want to invest in a good
purse so I hope that doesn't offend
anyone but if it's a lot and it's
stunning and so let's just dive into the
purse so this is what it looks like I
don't think it has any other pocket it's
just like it's nice black goes with
everything gold hardware GG open it up
that's a lot of room obviously the first
thing I keep in my bag is my phone oh my
god do my wood what's on my iPhone's
like those types of videos where thing I
do anyway I just have my phone in my
purse pretty self-explanatory I also
keep headphones in my purse because I
feel like any time I'm out like here's
the thing I'm getting my nails done or
something I just put them in my phone
put them my ears kind of zone out for a
little bit or wherever you are like
waiting for an appointment really
there's just headphones I don't know why
we've been trying to explain that along
with the phone I keep a charger I feel
like I've been better wrapped in my
phone charge it doesn't die as much but
I always keep a nice little charger in
my purse in case of emergency or unless
you like sleep at your friend's house
and you forget your charger good to have
it in your first sunglasses I've been
cutting around these they are key
Australia I got them all princess Polly
they're just like kind of fabulous I
don't know I think they're fun and
different and super cool and then I have
them in like random key Australia
collaboration case with Bessie Perkins
but these aren't a collab with desi
they're just cute sunglasses
well else oh my god such a good youtuber
try to put this in there I've been
carrying on my vlog camera because I'm
vlogging today so when I was packing up
my purse to leave the house this morning
and run errands before filming put my
blog camera in and I always have an
extra battery and charger with me
because this thing dies more than you
know if I'll get a little behind the
scenes for the ball right now I'm
filming obviously you keep the vlog
camera in my purse so if there's any
funny moments or something that I want
to capture or if I'm just vlogging my
week or day it's right there and this
purse is so big it doesn't even take any
room up makeup like these are the coach
endo cleansing spa water I work out a
lot so any time I'm going to a workout
class I've always liked my face with
this to prevent the breakouts because
obvious reasons gum this looks like a
rat like ripped it apart Sweetman orbit
not sponsored car keys obviously the car
keys I remember I
this little tassel thing I think
birthday party like a gift thing yeah
I'd like my initials on it I don't know
I just keep it on my little keychain
obviously I keep my wallet in my purse
I'm actually probably gonna buy a new
wallet soon I've had this one for ages
and I think I'm just ready to explore
some other wallets maybe a more like
just maybe like a black wallet or
something basic because I don't know
it's cute but I kind of want to upgrade
to a new wallet okay and then for makeup
I keep a concealer this one's the Kylie
cosmetics skin concealer it's in the
shade maple I've been trying this out I
don't really know if I like it
yeah it's pretty thick but it looks like
I don't know if you can see that but um
yeah just in case like I need to cover
up the blemish I have a really big zit
right here I don't know if you can tell
I tried to cover it for this video but
yeah it's really rough so concealers a
necessity and then oh my gosh okay let
me just show you guys this so I keep
this chopstick I always talk about this
it's like the smaller version of the
glue stick one that I always talk about
it's the cocoa butter formula with
vitamin E by Palmer's so I always keep
like some sort of lips like lip balm or
chapstick or like aqua for it and then I
always keep a red lip pencil this sounds
really weird well it doesn't sound that
weird but what I like to do with this is
if I have like no makeup on I love when
my lips are tinted like a kind of
reddish color I guess I could just use
like a lip tint or something I don't
know why I do this but I like to just
like smear this pencil over my lips and
then like really smudge it out and then
I put this on so it's like moisturizing
kind of glossy and then it looks like my
lips are just like a little bit red
intuitive like very naturally I could
just use the lip tint like or a
chopstick with like a red tint so I'll
probably get one of those soon but in
the meantime I like doing this and then
lastly I keep a nude lipstick this is
Mac in the shade glaze and then I also
keep an extra tie because you never know
kids you never know so that's everything
I keep in my purse thank you guys so
much for watching
make sure to give it a thumbs up if you
enjoy also I didn't dress my hair I
decided to like style it a little bit
different today so if you guys want a
tutorial on that button just let me know
um but yeah I think it's really fun and
like lioness so thanks for watching I
love you guys and I'll see you next time
