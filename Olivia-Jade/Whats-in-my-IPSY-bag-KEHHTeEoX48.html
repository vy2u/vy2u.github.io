things I want to apologize for the first
is my lack of uploads if you follow me
on snapchat I feel like I said that in
every video but I seriously update you
guys on my YouTube life on my snapchat
so yeah something sticky on my leg if
you guys follow me on snapchat then you
would know I had the most stressful
morning this morning it's Father's Day
and um basically I've been trying to
upload videos all day something always
goes wrong with backgrounds ugly it's
blurry my camera dies my memory card
gets taken up like it's full it's so
today was just not my day at all there
was a part of me that was like you know
what I'm not even filming today I'm not
going to film for the next two weeks
gonna take a two-week you to break and
I'm not gonna leave anybody with a video
for like a month
then I thought that'd be really rude so
I'm not going to do that um but today
I'm going to do a very easy video
because my tutorials weren't working out
for me today I just wanted to do
something where I was already ready and
my hair is nasty as you can see that's
just not a cute look so anyway I did not
try super hard to look my best in this
video sorry
um I'm wearing like a very comfortable
t-shirt from scarlet and gold shop and
you know so today I am doing my Ipsy bag
unboxing kind of thing basically I've
actually already taken it out of the
paper part like packaging but I have not
seen what is inside the glam bag yet so
basically if you don't know what if C is
it's a subscription website that you pay
I think ten or twelve dollars a month
not sure the exact price I'm signed up
for it and you pay a certain amount of
money per month and then they send you a
bag full of beauty products every month
so it ranges from makeup to skincare to
hair products but the general theme of
everything is beauty so if you guys are
interested in seeing what came in my
June if C bag then just keep watching
and I hope you all enjoy so first the
actual bag itself it's black with hot
pink it's a very cute toiletry case and
it has it C written all over it
and the first thing I'm going to pull
out
is this what if it's a gentle
exfoliating gel with rose petals loose
probably smells good
oh stop it
oh my god oh my god it smells so good it
smells of roses put a little bit on the
back of my hand to show cool to show you
guys what the consistency looks like
okay so it's basically I'm sorry I am
you can see on my hand it's all white
and pasty because I rubbed eyelash glue
all over me and I'm not even wearing
fake lashes that was such a fail like a
very oily kind of consistency but then
it has those kind of that kind of sandy
beady texture because of the little
things in it that are going to exfoliate
your skin I don't know what those are
called totally blanking probably never
even knew it in the first place anyway
okay so that's the first thing that came
my tips tea bag I am so excited to use
this it says massage onto damp or dry
skin then rinse with water use one to
two times a week avoid the eye contour
area so you're not supposed to get it in
this area just I'll probably do it on my
cheeks my chin my forehead and yeah next
in my Ipsy bag came my be fine food skin
care cucumber facial mask with cucumber
which is basically just a cucumber scrub
oh no it's a mask just a but the
consistency of this oh that's thick and
just I don't love the smell of cucumbers
without a straight-up cucumber that's
going to be there for the rest of the
video I don't I'll wipe it on my leg I
react really strange to cucumbers my
face turns bright red so hopefully that
doesn't happen with this I'm going to
try it anyway
but um it's a facial mask and you're
supposed to leave this on for five
minutes
and it also says do not apply around eye
area so I guess with both of these
products in the Ipsy bag to not apply it
near your eyes next is this formula X
nail color come on
um ooh that's pretty
it's kind of like a strawberry pink and
it is by X formula this I think is
probably a sample size but I'm not quite
sure and yeah it says power so sample
not sample not for individual sale yeah
okay so basically if you're into
painting your nails you can also get
that in your epsy bag and then the last
thing in my Ipsy bag is a trustee
trustee Aspen pine eyeshadow crayon
which i think is really cool so using
this would be it but it's actually not
this is just the cat to it so you lift
that off I just pulled that off and then
in here is the actual stick which has a
ton of product on it and let's give that
a swatch here whoa that is so nice
okay so this product is so pigmented
well that's that so that is it for my
June glam FC bag I hope you guys all
enjoyed it
let me know down below if you guys want
me to do kind of a series of what is in
my Ipsy bag or if that sounds awful I
won't do that but like maybe once a
month I could just throw up an extra
video just telling you what's in my Ipsy
bag umm if you guys are curious to see
you care yeah thank you for watching I
hope you all enjoyed and I will see you
guys in my next one I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
