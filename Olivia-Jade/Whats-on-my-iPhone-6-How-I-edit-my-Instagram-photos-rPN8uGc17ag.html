my channel today I'm filming a what's on
my iPhone video because this is very
requested I asked you guys any video
requests on my snapchat and Twitter and
when I asked you guys on snapchat most
of the requests were the what's on my
iPhone video and I thought this fit
nicely because I just got a new phone
and I just got the six so I'm like up to
date with the new phone I'm feeling
really cool so if you guys do want to
see what's on my iPhone 6 then just keep
watching I just use fingerprint to
unlock it and then the first page I'm
not really going to go into depth about
because it's all the standard apps that
come on the phone I have notes which I
use a lot for video ideas that's the
only thing that's important I guess and
relevant I use calculator a lot so those
are on the first page of only 2 apps I
really use our notes and calculator and
then on the bottom I have my phone mail
Safari and music and I used all of those
quite often is not planned out I have
not organized any of this this is just
how it is so I'm sorry if it's a mess
and if it's giving you a little bit of
OCD I apologize so then on the next page
I have social and when you open that up
I a vine Instagram snapchat Twitter and
peak which are all public except for
keek I don't even use geek I don't even
know why I have that app honestly I'm
very confused as to why I have it and
I've never used it I've never made a
cake in my life before so that's cool I
guess I just got it because I think it
was kind of big back last year some time
last year was like cool the cake so then
I always had it on my phone but I never
check it use it I don't even know what I
have it so I have vine which is public I
have Instagram which is publicize
snapchat was public they have Twitter
which is public my vines Instagram
snapchat and Twitter will be here and
then they will all be linked down below
so if you want to give me a follow it
would be much appreciated I'm kidding
self-promotion wet no so then for the
next folder I have health I have this
app called clue on this app called seven
and I'm obsessed with 7 it's a seven
minute workout and you start your
workout and then you can have different
voiceovers and you do it for seven
minutes straight when you go to workout
you can do full body up
arms core lower body and then random you
have this special pack which is cardio
fat burn explosive strength and stretch
now editing I have after like vsco cam
facetune and perfect three six five so
after like I'll show you how I ended a
photo let's say I just chose this one of
my camera here first go on the tool bar
right there and I press brightness and
then I would probably saturate it all
the way down to make it black and white
probably put some contrast all the way
I'd probably clarify it a little bit and
I would probably choose original and it
eats a good hole or Raven I do Raven but
I turn it down a little bit and then you
click on it and you can see how it
looked before and outlook after then
vsco cam is another great editing app
because it has really cool filters and
then facetune I have no idea how to work
this app I just I don't understand we
think I know how to do is morph people's
face but I'm trying to learn how to use
it so then I can look like a freaking
goddess and all the Instagram photos but
I don't know I'm kidding it's really
it's really misleading when people do
that when you see them in person it's
almost hard to recognize them because
they've just faced doing themselves so
much and that's not supposed to be me
okay anyway moving on I have a folder
called random which has a fine my iPhone
card start SoundCloud and Shazam
I have card star which is for my school
I have SoundCloud and Shazam and
SoundCloud is just an app where you can
listen to music and then Shazam is a
really really good app basically if you
hear a song in a store and a party and
you're like oh this is really awkward if
I ask you can just Shazam it and then
you press Shazam you press the listen
button and then it listens with the
speaker to the music playing and then it
will be like the song name and who's it
Bob next I have games which I have
temple-run flappy bird and video star I
know I'm super old school with flappy
bird I have the original version not
even the updated one I just died but and
then video star which you can make your
own music videos on next I have shopping
which I have the hunt and Polyvore and
the hunt is an app that I never use but
I think it's cool the concept of it is
cool but nobody ever responds to my
searches so then I just gave up
the app if you see somebody walking down
the street in a really non creepy
stalkerish way take a photo of what
they're wearing if you like it and then
you post it to the hunt and then you can
say I want this exact outfit or
something similar to it and then give a
price range or whatever and then people
on the Hutt will help you find my outfit
and I think it's a really cool idea that
I have Polyvore which is basically a
really really really good website let's
say you have a bar mitzvah and you're in
seventh grade like my days this is what
I use Polly Bohr was my thing in seventh
grade because I really needed to find
these but Mitzvah dresses the Bar
Mitzvah dresses because I have a lot of
bottom bar mitzvahs back in my
seventh-grade days and so I make it
sound like I'm so old I'm only a night
good so I needed to find some black
dress let's say so you go on polieville
just select dress and then you select
the color in black it just gives you a
bunch of black dresses from a bunch of
different websites and then you can just
choose whichever one you like and then
we'll take you to the website and then
you can buy it so it's like a little
personal shopper next folder is YouTube
which I have Pinterest and studio
Pinterest is where I get most of my food
ideas from Emma for my video studio is
basically an app where you can check
everything that's going on with your
channel so that's it for what's on my
iPhone I hope you guys all enjoyed this
video and I hope it entertained you a
little bit let me know in the comments
down below what other videos you guys
like to see in the future and I will see
you my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
