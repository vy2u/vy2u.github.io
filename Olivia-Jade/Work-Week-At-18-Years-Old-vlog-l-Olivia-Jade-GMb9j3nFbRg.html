another vlog as you've enjoyed my hair
done I just got it done so I'll insert a
little clip of me getting it done right
now pretty well okay my hair is done so
now that you saw that I am waiting for
my makeup artist Angie to get here I
have a Sephora event tonight with
Sephora collection and this video is
actually in claw bliss for a collection
to talk about their new lip stories so
tonight's the launch party for it so I'm
gonna go to that you guys know Chantel
Chantel Jeffries is DJing so I'm excited
to see her I don't know how this is
gonna be there but it should be really
fun but I did want to show you guys the
new lip stories that Sephora collection
has come out with and look how cute
packaging is Sephora collection let's
trace this lipstick is for real life not
just real life and you open it up and
there are 40 shades and what's cool is
like it literally shows a story with
each lipstick
oh and drugstore price might I add like
look at the packaging it's so cool
everything has a little different story
so I'm definitely gonna wear one of
these tonight I'll decide with my makeup
artist and what's cool also is like you
can tell what color is each like this is
gonna be a nude that's a red that's a
purple this is like a vampy blue I'm
gonna swatch a few shades that I think
most people would wear maybe this nude
pink ooh let's do this red if you like
this kind of deep purple I love that
every single product has a story to it
because I feel like that even makes it
easier to choose a lip product that
you're gonna wear like it kind of
eliminates the like hmm what do I want
to wear on my lips tonight when you have
so many different ranges of colors and
shades it's like you have a purpose for
it which is really cool let's watch this
nice little nude first this is what it
looks like so gorgeous the first shade I
already showed y'all I'm gonna swatch it
on my wrist
actually I'm gonna lip color I'm not
just a minute
by miles levy to my sister's going to
Pilates oh my god they're so creamy ooh
that one is so nice thought a mirror
quote next shade let's do like this
little quarterly one this one is in the
shade number 25 called first class this
is the real test
$8 you guys oh this is like next-level
this is like revolutionary I'm so proud
to be an ambassador holy crap I love
this brand this in the summer time and
spring is gonna be so good okay I'm
trying a new one oh they come off so
easy too
that's ideal next shade I'm gonna test
out is the shade number 31 it's called
Golden Gate and it has the Golden Gate
Bridge on it so that's pretty awesome
gotta love a good vampy winter purple I
don't understand how they made these
like perfect like just like literally so
smooth this is the next one I think this
one's awesome sorry for this lighting
and I look a little bit rough but I'm
gonna do one more you guys have actually
never been so excited about a product I
think I'm even more excited as how fast
and easy it comes off okay and the last
one I'm talking about is this really
true beautiful red it's in the shade
number 22 it's called a little magic
this is like your best friend for the
holidays let's see how this goes this is

plenty more of these on vlogs and
favorites and other videos but this red
