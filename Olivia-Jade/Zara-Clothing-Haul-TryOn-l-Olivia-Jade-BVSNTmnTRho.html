my channel or welcome to my channel in a
today's video I am doing Hazara try on
clothing haul I recently ordered a few
squirts online and then I went into
their store and got a few more things so
because I've been posting on Instagram
in some of these newer outfits everyone
has been asking where they're from and I
just wanted to show you guys really
quickly do a little Tryon hopefully that
helps people that we're wondering if you
guys are interested in that and just
keep watching make sure to subscribe it
means a lot to me I post kind of
whenever but I try and post a couple
times a week once we get least I hope so
yeah let's get started I love you and if
you enjoy so the first thing I want to
talk about is something that I posted an
Instagram in and people were going crazy
asking me where it's from so I have this
little yellow top from Zara it actually
comes in a set I believe it's set to
yeah there's like fifty dollars around
fifty dollars I think it's so cute I
love it it's like super nice and tight
around your boobs so it's not gonna like
fly off you a little bit of stigmas and
works great on everything I think it
should look a really flattering classy
top and this is a matching skirt it's
just like this really long pretty maxi
skirt I think this is going to look so
beautiful for like a summertime dinner I
wore it to like kind of a springy summer
event and I just paired it with some
like nude heels and it looks really cute
but you could also wear this with like
sneakers and then what I also love about
it is you can like wear this on its own
so I think this would look really cute
with like boyfriend jeans or something
super cropped for the summertime um but
yeah I absolutely love this set I loved
it so much I had to get it in blue cuz
I'm crazy so I'm probably not necessary
that I needed it in another color but um
this is just like kind of a more toned
down version if I'm not feeling like
yellow in my wardrobe if that makes
sense so I really love this I think it's
so pretty so cute and it also comes with
a really pretty maxi skirt as you guys
see in the trial and just look quick bit
and you know it just goes all the way
down it's the same thing so moving on to
skirts this is one of my fave skirts
this is so cute it's just like this
little denim
and miniskirt and I love this little
ruching kind of like pattern it has on
the side I think this looks really great
with a bodysuit the only thing is I got
an extra small and all these skirts so
if you're around my size and you're
wondering I did get an extra small but I
do feel that this skirt is still a
little bit big on me so I'm going to
have to go and get them all hemmed which
is the only annoying thing but I still
love it anyway I also got this really
pretty dress from Zara I got this in an
extra small as well and I think this is
just really flattering it's a mini
v-neck it's not like a super deep V but
it kind of has like this double layer so
it has this little going on and then it
just goes straight into the dress and
then also the back of it is like the
best it just has this black detailing by
the zipper I think it just adds
something a little bit extra to the
dress it's skirt is literally one of my
favorite things in the world I got it in
an extra small as well it is a tiny bit
big but since it has a tie I just tie it
really tight it looks like this so again
it kind of has that double layer frill
pattern going on and it has like this
really kind of weird flower pattern
across the skirt but I'm kind of really
into it I think it just adds something
extra and it has a tie so if you tie it
really tight around you it will stay up
it looks really cute on this looks great
with a body suit sneakers boots whatever
it's adorable so this shirt I've been
loving it's just this like little gray
no not grey it's blue and white
little pinstripes and I just really love
the shape of it I think it looks great
with jean shorts really cute with like
boyfriend jeans and I really get out
many ways to wear this yes and I think
it's just like a casual little summer
blouse to throw on if you're just
running out the door like some cute like
boyfriend ish shorts and sneakers I also
got this jean skirt which I'm obsessed
with it's so cute I wore this on an
Instagram photo wall the photo right
here but anyone was knocking where it's
from so it is from Zara I was just
waiting to the hall for people to see
but I love how this leg has like this
sprayed denim just
I hear it looks really edgy it just
really adds something to a plain dark
denim jean skirt
now for my favorite top in the world I
wear this out yesterday and I just
summer vibe so it is a little bit
thicker but just a nude bra works under
it or like flower petals whatever or if
you're into like that nip look this is
your shirt done but I'm not really into
that uh but it's just really pretty it's
like this perfect little summer blouse
it was so great boyfriend jeans so good
with like skinny jeans so good I went on
look like he's really cute like wash
jeans yesterday
looks like it was shorts I don't think I
would wear a skirt with those kind of so
loose but I loved it it looks really
perfect it's really lightweight so it's
summer where you are if it's getting
really warm it's the best shirt ever
it's probably one of my favorite things
in my closet right now although this
dress is adorable
I really like it and then I try to on
yesterday to go out and I just like
wasn't feeling it I think it just cuz I
was like going out out and like this is
just a little too daytime to wear out or
you'll be on the trial and it's just
like this really pretty white dress it
ties around your neck and it also has
ties in the back suit and like cinch
your waist a little bit and it just kind
of goes down into like just a little
mini summer dress I mean this is going
to look so cute over a bathing suit or
just out like to get lunch in the
summertime with your girlfriends call my
ring this skirt is also really cute I
don't know if you can tell you'll be
able to tell more in the trial and it
comes apart but it had two toned denims
one has a light wash and then a medium
to dark wash and then it's frayed at the
bottom and has rips all throughout it I
think this is like a really perfect way
if you don't know how you want to kind
of make your style a little bit edgier
that's kind like an easy way to do it
because of the material on the pattern
and the details I guess on it make it
look a little bit more like chill I
heard about makes any sense instead of
like crap be ready to go and then lastly
to finish off with some shoes these are
also from Zara of course this whole
thing is from Zara but I love these
these are kind of like kind of weird but
they come remind me of like maybe Gucci
or something like trying to do that
weird just random materials but I really
love them they're a gentleman
how much dope they're like a dental
material they have all these little Zita
flowers all over them they're definitely
something different but I think they
look really great with just like a
casual outfit it just like add something
to it there's so fun for the summertime
and also because this and this are like
levels out it makes it super easy to
walk in it really doesn't feel like
you're what has like an arch or like
it's painful it's just super very
comfortable so also I'm all about like I
feel comfortable because I'm tiny and I
always love making myself a little bit
taller make my legs a little bit longer
nothing wrong with that so that is it
for my video thank you so much for
watching my little minis are a haul I
hope you guys loved it and I'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
