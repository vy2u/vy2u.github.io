today I am just talking to you and then
we sit in here and just rambling about
life so I'm not going to keep this video
super long I tweeted like do you guys
want me to just sit down do make up and
talk to you or do you want me to post
like a travel makeup tutorial and
honestly at the end of the day I decided
I was going to just sit here I'm not
going to be putting makeup on I'm not
going to be doing anything except just
talking to you like a best friend like
me venting to a friend would because
I've missed doing it on my channel I
think I got kind of caught up with what
other people were doing and worried that
my videos weren't as a techy or like as
cool as like you know the fun edits and
everything and then I realize like
that's not what I came on YouTube to do
I just came on here to talk to you guys
and to have a good time and to just
express what I love and just like talk
about what I love doing and what I don't
love doing and where I've been and why I
haven't been posting and all that so
this is nothing but a little bit of a
rant to my best friends so if you want
to see where I've been then keep
watching a lot of people have been
tweeting me where have you been because
I haven't really been posting videos and
I know it's only been like 7 days or 8
days since I posted which some people
don't think is a long time but for me
going from posting twice a week this
whole entire month to just nothing is a
little bit off and weird and it feels
weird but I needed to do it to realize
how much I love YouTube and how much I
want to continue doing YouTube if that
makes sense
so basically I just kind of felt like I
didn't enjoy making videos anymore and
it's not like a permanent thing where I
forever felt like oh I'm never going to
love YouTube I knew that I would kind of
get out of this little funk that I was
in but I in that this past week I could
have got out of it all I could think is
oh I have to film a video subscribers
you're going to be so mad at me if I
don't film like I have to film I don't
want to feel
and I want to upload I just want to
upload I just like didn't want to do the
whole process so I think that became a
little bit of an issue because when
you're doing something like YouTube that
takes so much time and so much effort
and you actually have to think about
stuff you want to do and what you're
allowed to put out on the Internet and
what you're not allowed to put on the
internet like it takes effort it takes
creativity it's not something where I
can just live out my phone I mean I
could and I'm sure you guys would love
it because they're awesome and seem to
support me with everything I do but I
want my videos to be a little bit better
than that
um so I just kind of felt like I don't
know what to post I didn't want to post
I didn't want to film and that's when I
knew that like I couldn't force myself
at that point because I know such
firstworldproblems I boo you love you
don't want to film a video like cry
about it I know it sounds a minor and so
silly but for the people that I've been
wondering where I am
I'm telling you like I just don't want
to film I wasn't traveling I wasn't sick
I wasn't there's not really a good
excuse except that I was kind of losing
thought and creativity and I didn't know
what to put up on YouTube anymore so
that was kind of frustrating for me a
little bit because I want to film so
badly and I always want to be like you
know I always want to be like active on
my youtube I don't like when youtubers
grow and then they kind of just leave
their subscribers for months on end like
that's not me tuber I want to be and
that's all the youtuber I'll ever become
a promising that but there will be times
where I'm just like okay I can't post
every single second of every single day
that I've promised a post because it
does get to be a lot especially when I'm
still a teenager in school and I still
want to be with my friends too it kind
of gets hard to balance but I'm here to
tell you that I am back and I am better
than ever I printed out a little
calendar planning what I'm going to do
how I'm going to film what I'm going to
upload because I am traveling a lot this
month in July and in August I will not
be in town for a little bit so I just
want to make sure I'm not slacking when
I'm out of town
because that's I feel like even worse um
so yeah that's basically all I'm trying
to say like I don't want you to think
that I took this break because I'm over
you guys or because I don't love you
guys and those are my absolute virtual
best friends and I will never change I
will never let fame or followers or um I
don't know get to my head however let
you know any number of followers on
screen to find me or to find my
happiness because I think for a quick
second I was about to get there I was
like oh my god I'm so close to two
hundred thousand come on guys nobody
subscribed to me mm why do I care about
how many numbers I have a screen like
cool it's a goal it's a goal its
abolishment it's a number but I don't do
YouTube for the number of followers and
I think that was getting to my head a
little bit I'm like I just want to send
myself down I had to be like obviously I
want to build my community with you guys
together and become a bigger family and
just you know share the love I want more
people to watch me I want to make people
happy I hope my videos the ones that I'm
making happy right now can grow and help
make other people happy but I'm not
doing YouTube to be famous or to be
YouTube famous which would be a social
media star look I just want to do
YouTube because I like doing YouTube and
it really sucks
for a moment that I was like I need this
number to make me super happy hmm look
at she is that many amount of
subscribers like that's so awesome she
must be so happy like that's not going
to make you happy and if you're a young
youtuber or a fury young right now and
you're wanting to be a youtuber for the
number of followers you're not going to
get anywhere I promise you you have to
do something you're passionate about
because people see right through that
and people want to watch people that
like love doing what they're doing so I
hope you can tell in this video and in
most of my other videos that I love
doing what I
I love to including old I love doing
making sure I love just sitting down and
talking to you guys like a real person
like a real friend like you guys are my
best friends sorry for cursing I'm gonna
put a bleep over it but it's not like
that it's not like a certain number of
followers to find your happiness at all
it's just like the more your channel
grows I think you'd become proud of
yourself everything it just becomes
worth like when or when even just a
positive comment it like lets me know
like what I'm doing people like like
when a person subscribes it's like Oh
somebody's liking what I'm doing like
that's so cool
I've been something I'm loving and
somebody is understanding that and
loving it too if that makes sense so
that's why I think building a foundation
or a base or something like YouTube is
really awesome but I would never think
it's awesome to be famous or social star
and trust me I've grown up with a famous
mom I don't think Fame is cool I can't
wait to film more for you guys and I
hope this video wasn't too long or too
boring and I hope you guys stuck through
the end and if you did I love you so so
much
so I'm gonna end it here before this
goes on for 30,000 more years but I love
you guys and I will see you tomorrow
because tomorrow is Wednesday you get
two videos in two days because I'm back
I'm back my buzzing fizzles so what's
inside it and you get a surprise one
today which is Tuesday hope you had a
amazing safe fun crazy cool fourth of
July and I'll see you guys tomorrow yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
