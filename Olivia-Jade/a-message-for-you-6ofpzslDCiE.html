back to another video in today's video I
really am doing this very spontaneously
I don't really know what I'm saying or
what I'm talking about
but it's something that's been weighing
on my mind a lot so I wanted to share it
with you guys so if you guys want to see
like what I'm thinking some advice I
have then please keep watching and I
really hope you enjoy I wanted to do a
little storytime because we are almost
out of million subscribers of when I
first started my YouTube channel and how
it affected me when I didn't have many
followers and I lost a lot of friends
because that was the reality I had a
really good close group of best friends
I had like my bestest bestest friends in
the world I thought nothing could ever
change nothing could ever happen they
were gonna stick by my side forever and
the second I started my channel and it
started to get out there and whatnot
people those friends really what like
they just didn't want to be my friend
anymore and they just kind of like
pieced out and there's so much more that
like builds up to that and so much more
that I'll never realize that I did and
they'll never realize that they did to
hurt me but it just kind of makes you
realize like well your best friends are
gonna leave your side when you need them
the most
who are you to trust and I feel like so
many girls are going through that right
now the constant talking that they
get from their friends or not be
included by their best friends and it's
so hard you feel so confused you're like
why why am I not a part of this why
don't people like me like all you can
think is like why don't people like me
and it's so confusing because you just
want to be like do you feel like you're
being nice you feel like you're trying
to fit in and be cool and so my main
message for that is you do you you have
to do what makes you happy you have to
go out there and be yourself and be
authentic and really at the end of the
day if that means for you of starting a
YouTube channel because you love cooking
because you love makeup because you love
fashion because whatever it is you love
video gaming it's not for your friends
it's not for your family it's for you so
if people aren't gonna support you and
your decision to do
whatever that's their problem and that's
their loss I know that I have such great
friends now and I've made so many great
friends from doing what I'm passionate
about that you couldn't you couldn't
change a single thing I've done this
whole time there are times when I put
all my videos on private when boys and
girls at parties would blast my videos
in front of me and I was so embarrassed
I was like this could life get worse
right now videos all jumbled and like I
don't really know what I'm trying to say
honestly but this is just a topic that's
been on my mind something that I've been
feeling insecure about something that I
feel like a lot of people are probably
going through as well so I just wanted
to spread the message that like you need
to do what makes you happy you need to
follow your dreams and your path and
there's a path for everyone maybe
someone doesn't believe in your path or
doesn't encourage your path or doesn't
even support what you want to do with
your life but that shouldn't matter and
I know so many of you guys come up to me
and are like I want to start this I want
to do this but I'm scared what people
will think and I think at the end of the
day my main message to that is are these
people really really really gonna be
there for you in the long run if they
can't support something that you love
doing and I think that was really hard
for me to grasp when I lost a lot of
friends a lot of people told me I was
doing this for fame for followers I
didn't actually like doing this so
challenging to like hear all this
negative conversation from people that
you thought were your friends I just
want you to know that time tells all you
are normal you are loved by so many
people you don't even realize so many
people are going to walk into your life
when you least expect it and change it
when I was 14 I started my youtube
channel I had around zero followers and
then a few months in you know slowly
started gaining followers when I started
to gain my followers I started to lose
my friends which coincidence not really
I don't know what it's time from if it
stemmed from jealousy if they thought I
changed as a person I don't know what it
was but that's kind of when Tyler walked
into my life and completely helped me in
that sense of just feeling like loved by
someone and just like genuinely like
someone was proud of me
that's really hard like it's a really
hard feeling when like ah wait guys I
did not expect to get emotional in this
video like it's hard when like you just
feel like no one like wants to be your
friend and like I get it and I feel like
you guys only see one image of me that's
like oh she's his perfect life she's
growing up with like in a celebrity
household like she could order stuff
online whenever she doesn't have any
issues like and like I know how blessed
I am but like also I don't want people
to think I'm just like some fake human
like I totally get what a lot of you are
going through and like that's why all I
can say is just like keep your head up
and don't be afraid to like go after the
things you love because if I didn't
start youtube I don't know where I would
be genuinely like I was so I'm not gonna
say I was depressed cuz I would be
self-diagnosing myself basically but I
was so sad I felt like there was like a
huge hole in my heart at that time where
I had no friends and all I had was a guy
that like appreciated me but like that
wasn't good enough for me because I
wanted my best friends back I don't want
to ramble I've been talking for 10
minutes I'm gonna have to cut a lot of
this out but I think my main message is
just kind of like do you and be you and
be you for you not for anyone else I
look back I'm like how did I ever feel
that way like how did I feel like I
genuinely had no purpose how did I lie
in bed at night literally every night
for probably two and a half years
straight crying myself to sleep asked my
mom why no one liked me like it's hard
so like I don't know I just want to make
this video for you guys cuz if you're
going through that or if you feel like
one of your friends is going through
that like be there for them and be kind
and be a good person and I guess that's
all I really can say thank you guys for
watching I hope this message made some
sort of sense and I hope that it helped
you if you're feeling lonely or like you
don't really have a purpose I love you
guys so so much thank you for almost 1
million I can't even I can't even wrap
my head around it you guys are my rock
and I hope that I can be the same for
you bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
