I'm filming a June Q&amp;amp;A for you guys if
you do want to see it then just keep
watching and I hope you all enjoy make
sure you guys are friends with me on
snapchat because I do update you guys
when I'm doing a Twitter Q nice well
it's not driven yo Twitter Q nice
happening
go ask me questions and then I got way
more questions this time I also update a
lot about my YouTube on snapchat like
when I post so this is my snapchat it's
OVA j23 so make sure you guys add me on
there for a good time I post a lot on my
story so alright so let's get started
into the Q&amp;amp;A with you all enjoy I'm kind
of leaning towards the more kind of
advice questions I won't be doing names
and I won't be putting the questions on
the screen like I normally do because
this is more of a personal kind of
advice Q&amp;amp;A so let's get started I hope
you all enjoy what made you want to do
YouTube the main thing that made me want
to do YouTube just watching other videos
I think is so much fun and I just got
really into that so after I watched so
many people's videos I kind of wanted to
do a YouTube channel myself what's the
best foundation to use during this
summer I don't know an exact brand but I
think anything by L'Oreal I think is
always really good I would not do a
foundation unless you need full full
coverage if you have really a lot of
problem areas on your skin I don't think
you need a foundation during the summer
because it's hot at least where I am so
you're gonna sweat it off and it's gonna
look cakey and stuff I would go for a
light BB cream or CC cream and C's you
came especially because it has good SPF
in it along with BB cream but yeah I
just had my sister's password into my
phone nose beard which actress would you
pick to play you in a movie and why I
love you so much I love you so much too
and an actress I'd picked to play me in
a movie
probably Jennifer Lawrence because she's
so badass like I definitely want I mean
I don't know I don't know what kind of
question this is asking actually like I
would love for a movie but like somebody
I'm similar to I'm not really sure
because I don't think I'm nearly as bad
as Jennifer Lawrence
she's so cool my dreams like girl power
she is space in my opinion do you buy
your own makeup sometimes sometimes my
mom will buy of me sometimes I'll buy
for myself sometimes I'll get sets and
makeup products so I guess I just got it
from all over yeah
what is your favorite Starbucks drink
please please please please please
please don't get mad at me especially
all my girls that love Starbucks out
there I'm like hiding because I feel
like if I gonna scream at me and tear me
apart through the camera like not tear
me apart mentally but freaking
physically like I don't like Starbucks
okay I said it please don't hurt me what
are you most excited about this summer
by the way I love you by the way I love
you more and I am as excited about just
hanging out making lots of videos and
going to the beach with friends what is
your favorite summertime snack and
famous summer song Italy Italy - I hate
when I say oh they do love you too
and my favorite summertime snack is
plums and peaches and watermelon and
pineapple and strawberries and grapes
just cold tastes so good in the
summertime and like popsicles I also
really love those are like my favorite
stocks in the summer and my favorite
summertime song is
I don't really have a favorite song at
the moment but let me know your favorite
songs because I need to find some new
music why is it your sister and more
videos and thinking you guys are so
funny together because I just haven't
asked her to be in more videos yet but
if you guys do want her to be in videos
she can definitely be in videos it's not
a problem if we get 600 thumbs ups then
I will do a video with my mom and my
sister in the next month or so about
only if we get 600 ohms up and if we
don't and then it's just all me are you
coming out with a house tour no I am NOT
coming out with a house tour I that's
kind of like a privacy kind of thing
like that's a very big invasion of
privacy in my opinion and I will never
be doing a house tour as long as my
channels around and I don't really know
if my mom or my dad would ever want me
to do a house tour but my house is in
Elle Decor magazine so you guys can
check that out I will try to find the
issue and link it down below so you guys
could see a little snippet like little
pictures of my house but it will never
be on my channel are you gonna do any
meetups anytime soon honestly a meet-up
would be a dream Wow a meet-up would
honestly be a dream come true it'd be
the coolest thing ever like thinking
about it gets me so high up I don't know
I would love to meet up I don't know
where to do a meet-up how to do a
meet-up once you do meet up comment down
below where you guys live and then we'll
take it from there that would honestly
be the closest experience of my life be
so cool if you have three wishes right
now what will you wish for
alright stop this question should out to
me because I think it's a really good
question and it's right before we go
into kind of our deep confident advice
section of this Q&amp;amp;A but um this question
I thought was cool because my first wish
I'm not trying to sound like oh look at
me I'm such a good person like your
girl's so
and that's like I'm not trying to be
like that at all but truly my first wish
would be to cure cancer or to find a
cure for cancer you guys I didn't care
back on I mean height but just for
anybody to find a cure to cancer like
but be the coolest thing ever my friend
Bailey Madison has a little friend named
Brooke it turned it on Twitter hashtag
pray for Brooke for a little bit it was
trending on and off throughout the whole
day a couple of days ago and she's
cancer ended I don't know like there's
just so many people about her cat cancer
and they so don't deserve to nobody
deserves such cancer nobody deserves to
die that way but I don't know it's
something that makes me really sad and
I'm terrified of cancer I think it's a
scariest like nastiest thing like to
think people actually have to go that
way through pain and trying to fight it
and not successfully kicking cancers ass
that's like the saddest thing ever so
yeah next wish would be that all my
family is the whole thing in a happy
because I'm really good with all my
family and I don't want anything to ever
happen to them because I was scare me my
third wish is for a billion more wishes
when did you start wearing makeup I
don't know why I read that like there
was more to that question that was in um
I started wearing makeup when I was in
seventh grade I put linked eyeliner in
my lower lashline and I thought I look
so cool
it made my eyes look awful I looked like
I had the smaller size in the world but
it was such a bad thing but it was
really from it so it season I answer
this and my other Q&amp;amp;A is before so yeah
seventh grade is when I like first
started wearing makeup who are your top
five favorite oh I thought I would
answer the deep questions now um okay
stop
how do girls build their self-esteem so
honestly I think surrounding yourself
with positive people is going to build
your self-esteem if you're around
negative people that are always putting
you down or jealous of you or are just
constantly kind of being mean to you
something is definitely gonna be gone to
the freaking underworld it's gonna be so
low you always want to surround yourself
with positive people that are gonna make
you feel good not complimenting you look
oh you're the most beautiful person ever
others it's you have this sweet it's
your night so you wrote up like just
somebody that's always going to be nice
to you and inclusive and like always
make you feel welcome and a part of
things I think that instantly boost your
self esteem so I would try that if you
have a bad group of friends or a bad set
of girls or guys that are just kind of
like always making you feel
bad about yourself or your parents your
family or whatever if it's your family
talk to them and if it's friends or
something than just kind of separate and
try to make new friends because I think
that will instantly help next question
is I am so afraid to start a YouTube
channel how did you start and not care
what people think about you
girl I got this question so much um okay
Wow ready for Olivia to go into the
deepest mode ever like let's just
prepare like get ready for the deepest
stuff ever if you don't want to hear
deep really sappy true touches your
heart kind of stumped right now then
quit out of this segment of this video
because fast-forward so basically when I
started my youtube channel I was so
nervous I didn't really want to do it
anymore I got teased out cyber bullies
by people I knew but goodness no and
obviously when you're fresh off the bat
of making a YouTube channel the last
thing you want is for people to find it
you don't have any subscribers you think
you look lame you think all that kind of
stuff you are just so nervous so so so
nervous you want to impress people with
your YouTube channel you want to you
want them to know you're taking it
seriously but when you have one
subscriber and seven videos up and you
just haven't promoted yourself yet and
you're afraid something in your class is
gonna find it
I guess that feeling because that was me
at one point I think the biggest thing
you have to realize is the question of
do you like slash enjoy filming videos
is that something that makes you happy
do you find joy in it is it like kind of
your escape kind of place from like the
real world because that's kind of like
what YouTube is to me it's like a it's
like a place where I can like sit down
and film and just really enjoy it and
like not really worry about other people
or whatever you know so I don't know I
think that's something that's obviously
really really important if you enjoy
doing it then girls stick with it who
the hell cares what people say or guy
whoever's watching this I think it's so
important to follow your dreams and do
something you love you don't even know
you can accomplish so much if you just
follow your dreams I was so nervous
making YouTube channel
at first and I was so nervous making
sure at first it was the scariest thing
ever probably a year before I actually
made my channel I wanted to make one and
it took me a year to be like okay do it
and then I did it and I heard about off
the bat professional good camera good
quality good lighting all that kind of
stuff as you can see to go back to my
very first videos even though the
thumbnails are crap the actual content
itself wasn't that bad I mean I think
it's improved since then and I'm still
working on it a ton like this background
is ugly ass but it's just in front of a
window and I don't really want to like
lights on me today so anyway so I think
if you're serious about it if you really
want if this is something you like doing
if you want to turn it into something
you have goals and like number of
subscriber goals like a thousand in one
year that's a ton aim for that that's
what my cousin Anna's doing I'll have
her journaling tumbler shout out to my
diamond um she's a keychain I think I
should subscribe but now the point um
it's it's very important to just stick
with doing stuff you like doing and
simply love doing and who cares what
people say who cares who think at the
end of the day what they say has no
effect on you 20 years from now the
person that said your YouTube channel
sucks it's super awkward okay you're not
30 years old oh thank you you irrelevant
little shoo you little gross irrelevant
person that's how I would think I got
really into that that's how I would
think of it though like in 20 years the
person the people that are hating on you
you're probably never even gonna see
them again and your true friends are
always gonna support you that's my
advice for that so I wouldn't let other
people get in the way of your success or
dreams or whatever because they're not
they're so irrelevant okay and here's
also the thing I get and this can be
kind of scary especially if you know
people about our bullying you about it
because when I first started this may be
my last question actually this is
turning
to something else but so when I first
heard my youtube channel I was super
nervous to do it obviously and I was
bullied by people I knew which was worse
than people I didn't know and I think
that was my biggest fear and they nobody
has the guts to come up to you and tell
you in person your YouTube channel sucks
um and if they do you can have my
permission to slap them across the face
actually story time so there's like been
different like little instances of
people I know like teasing me or like
talking on my back about it and then it
gets back to me whatever and I'm like
mmm whatever like that's kind of
embarrassing but like I don't really
care that much because I actually really
like YouTube and I like doing it and
something I'm passionate about it's
something where like I see a lot of
growth in my channel and how like
supportive people are of me that I don't
even know so for the people that I do
know that are hating on me like waste
your time doing something else like
obviously you're gonna be nervous I
remember I was putting three snapshots
where you like it's just something rude
like that was trying to like break me
down and I looked at it and I was like
bro you are wasting your time putting in
putting me and your snapchat story all
the power to you because thank you for
clicking over in my video and watching
it and taking the time to put me your
snapchat story you know exactly my main
price though is don't let people get in
the way of you success or dreams or I
think honestly at the end of the day you
just have to be happy and proud of
yourself and as much as people like to
tear you down and rip you apart
it's so important to do something you
like doing because if you're doing
something to please other people or you
go around your whole life trying to
please other people and impress other
people you're not gonna do anything for
yourself you're gonna walk around on
your tippy toes so scared of what people
are gonna think you're never gonna walk
full force on your actual feet and I
just made that up but it sounds really
cool so don't be scared of it have fun
with it do what you love doing please
please please don't let other people get
in the way of you because it's so it's
they're so irrelevant 20-years girl 20
years they are not gonna matter next
year they're not gonna matter trust me
so yes thank you guys for watching I
love you all so much sorry for the end
it got like really deep and I got really
into it and I hope all
but I hope you enjoyed I hope this kind
of spoke out to if you're going through
something right now you're the best and
I will see you guys in the next one
sorry to end with such an aggressive
topic but girls and guys can be mean and
it really angers me I love you bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
