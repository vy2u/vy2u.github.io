guys on Instagram to ask me some
questions and I'm going to be eating
pizza because I love you to my torches
Oh cute I have enough lunching with a
hominid and I thought it's casual fun
umm and I sometimes eat healthy and I
sometimes don't and I haven't I don't
all right now so you ever pick one food
to eat for the rest of your life what
would it be
obviously pizza what's your favorite
drugstore concealer definitely the fit
me concealer by Maybelline that is my
favorite one welcome to throw up secret
talent oh my god
my secret Talent that's a don't have one
mmm I can run pretty fast that's Talent
is it weird to walk full house and be
like oh that's my mom yeah I totally is
if you were to die for a yay death
note sarcasm and you had a vision of
your happiest moment and you could go
back to it where would you be I love you
by the way I love me too
where would I be in my happiest place
would be vacation with Tyler's family on
a lake in Canada for sure best time ever
right bronzy Canada's Cameron's charter
Natasha is one of my best friends ever
yes if you could be anything else
besides a youtuber what would you be
I really think of YouTube as a job like
I'm a being a youtuber I feel like
sounds like it's your job and since I'm
a kid and I'm Explorer and I don't I
live with my parents still I'm Elise I'm
turning 17 like in a week and a half so
since I
I'm still a kid it's not technically
like a job for me like you outside your
sponsored post and like yes I get paid
for ads and stuff but it's just for me
to like save money on my own eventually
maybe buy myself an apartment or
something when I'm older so that's why
the new topic this is why I don't like
when people get upset about the
youtubers are like kids or whatever
doing sponsored posts because it's just
like like I've got offer I've been
offered a lot of emails and stuff and a
sponsor of opportunities and 95% of them
I say no to I just brands I genuinely
love that I say yes to and that's
something that you can either like
believe me or not I don't promote stuff
that I really don't like like makeup
wise or anything so it's a way to make
money I know that all people hating if
it was an opportunity if something said
hey we'll pay you to just talk about a
product if you genuinely love it like I
know a lot of people would say yes so I
don't really see an issue but I forget
the original question well that's my
answer to whatever that was oh I could
be anything else now so I'm not
technically I'm not a youtuber or I
guess I am but that's not like a job but
if I could be something besides a
youtuber I want to have my own makeup
line um one day they're going to live in
one place when you're older where would
it be by the way in my favorite youtuber
thank you oh that means a lot because
there's a lot of youtubers so I really
appreciate that my home call I would
choose LA just because I've grown up
here I was born and raised here this is
my whole life
but I do want to travel around the world
I'm going to live in different places
like I want to live in Australia for a
month and then head down to like I don't
know like just go to a bunch of
different places and I want to travel
the world and do something I love one
day hopefully what does your future look
like school kids career question work
school I'm applying to colleges this
year I'm a junior and um so that's cool
no no where I want to go kids not for a
long time career continued doing YouTube
even though it's not really my career
and then they have a makeup line we're
going to acting or just something really
fun I just genuinely love your to dye
your hair to her color what would it be
Platinum she like platinum gray pink
like a really light pinky platinum gray
I think that's so cool I just could
never pull it off it's so cool I think
people that do that just look really
really dope boom mmm
because your mom's famous do people
treat you differently yes I love you so
much I love you so much too
I mean of course people treat you
differently when they find out that kind
of information but I don't mess with
those type of people um you can be
friends ugly for me ringing I just my
mom for my mom but you cannot be found
just one of us to get to the other we're
too smart we can ask you what is your
workout routine like so I go to work FS
if that's the way I have to go I stay
motivated I have a gym in my house
actually because my sister always uses
it but we have a treadmill and stuff
down there but I just can't like
sometimes if I really need to workout
and it's been a while all around a
couple miles on the chocolate - um not a
lot but like going to work our class
motivates me so much more I love going
to cycling expen classes long you had a
YouTube channel without a youtube since
I was 14 years old i'm turning 17 this
year pretty crazy if you could change
one physical feature about you what
would it be
definitely
do you see right here how I have little
baby ears or like little baby
sideburn don't really know what they are
but I hate them so much I hate them I'm
so insecure about them and it's not even
like if I see them on other people I'm
like I never liked who that looks bad or
like I just meet what everyone else can
pull them off except me so I'm
definitely going to get them a lasered
away what's your favorite thing about
your sister if you guys know me you know
my sister is literally my other half
she's my best friend she is what is that
noise such a Strigoi she's very
supportive and she's literally like my
other half my best friend everything to
me and she'll always include me in her
plans because sometimes like I'm the kid
like I have friends but like it's really
worth me to connect with people I don't
know why so like when all my friends are
out partying sometimes I'll just be at
home like filming videos or just AG
lying in bed or like whatever and so
when she invites him to like last night
I went to dinner with her and her best
friend and like spent the whole night
with them so like like who's like my
older sister so it's not like that weird
or anything but like like her friends
like my older sister Charlotte excusing
it but like I don't know I don't know
she knows how much I like when she just
invites me somewhere or like includes me
it just makes me feel like she wants me
around it's like the sweetest thing and
it makes me feel really really good love
you be your favorite thing about being a
youtuber and what's your least favorite
thing one thing I dislike I'll start
with in a sec so we can end on a
positive note and this will be my last
question um one thing I dislike about
YouTube is that there are so many people
that can say whatever they want and I
think one thing I dislike is how many I
guess it's not just about YouTube it's
everywhere it's just how many negative
people there are now and how many people
feel the need to share their really
hateful rude opinions I hate it but one
thing I love about YouTube it's all
worth it because of you guys you are
literally my
what besties and I love all of you so
much and I love meeting you guys and
that's it so thank you so so much for
watching I love you so much like this
video if you like Instagram q and A's
