today's video always another clothing
haul
I have ongoing haul it far too long this
this is a super collective or big or
anything basically it's only from Lulu's
calm got such cute pieces and I'm in
collaboration with Lulu's for this video
but I think you guys are really going to
love the pieces I am so excited to share
with you I'd like a couple makeup things
but like not really so monthly Lulu's
calm is where my clothing is run that's
the only clothing I have in this video
I'm going to be trying on all the pieces
for you guys um this is the first piece
I will show you in a second but if you
guys want to see what I got from Lulu's
calm then please keep watching if you
enjoyed give it a thumbs up make sure to
subscribe and I will have everything
linked down below and like the correct
order so let's get started I hope you
love it
and I'll see you now first time from
Lulu's is this top of wearing the
sleeves are everything literally this is
the most amazing top I'm already
picturing it for like Coachella outfits
but it's going to be so beautiful in the
summertime a lot of the stuff I picked
out can be kind of summary or fallish
winter ish not for like really cold
climates but they do have a bunch on the
website for you know different seasons
instead of but for me since I live in
California and it's kind of hot like
year-round I decided to pick up the
pieces that I know I would get the most
use out of so I'm gonna link their
website down below just in general if
you want to browse other things besides
what I picked out but this is the first
top and it says gorgeous cargo green
color and of course I could not just get
it in one color because I think this
might be my new favorite piece in my
whole entire closet so I then also
picked it up in black and this is so
beautiful I just like I'm pretty much
obsessed with like the flowy sleeves so
I love love love that and it's the same
thing a black you will see in the Tryon
portion once again the next thing I got
is another shirt that's really cute off
the shoulder black top weight I'm pretty
sure it folds out yeah it's really cute
and it stretches I know it looks a
little bit little when I just hold it up
but it's so perfect I also got this
using bomber jacket this bomber jacket
is so great it's so warm and thick to so
it's really great for like a lot of
climates but I'm also super excited this
sounds crazy but in the summertime or in
the springtime when I'm at the beach in
my bathing suit I'm excited I just wear
this bomber jacket over a bathing suit
kind of like an la chic cover-up I don't
really know I also got this Lulu's
little grey t-shirt it's a little you're
gonna see you kind of more what it looks
like on the trial but it goes off your
shoulder a little bit and it stays off
your shoulder it's not one of the shops
when you lift up it flies up it kind of
is just perfect I also got the same grey
off the shoulder top in the lap so
that's that next I got these really cute
they're like fake leather pants but I'm
obsessed with them I wanted them for a
really long time I'll show you on the
child they look really good on and they
fit really really nicely
I got them in a size 24 I'm usually a
size 25 but they stretch and I think
they were out of a 25 when I was trying
to pick out the pieces okay I don't have
much left I'm going to dive into some
shoes right now I've got three pairs of
shoes so first these blue suede no blue
velvet um she's adorable
I've seen these all over places like on
YouTube and stuff and I've seen a lot of
people get them at Lulu's so I love them
there's such an amazing shoe they're
just like a good staple I also got
another bootie and don't know what
Brandis are but you can look on Lulu's
website and they're just black boots and
I thought this part was really kind of
cool it's like this mirrored heel I
don't know I've never seen anything like
this so when I saw these only lose I was
like yes please I'll take them I think
they're gonna be really cool with those
leather pants for another pair of shoes
this is the last pair of shoes I got
they like lace up your ankle and they're
perfect
through these blush pink heels I am
going to a tropical place in next week
and I'm so excited to bring these
they're just perfect I love them for the
spring and summer I know we're not in
spring and summer but I'm like already
shopping I'm over winter and fall
shopping right now I'm
into the spring/summer collection since
I live in California I can pull that off
right now so I love them so that is
everything I got from Lulu's clothing
wise I just wanted to throw this in
because I'm so excited about them I got
the new morphe palette I got this morphe
palette this is in 25 B these are
limited edition and I think they're sold
out but they might bring them back I
don't really know so this is 25 B I'm so
excited if you bought these let me know
if you want to see a tutorial on them
and I honestly don't think you need to
get both of them this is the one in 25a
I've already dug into it but I don't
think you need to get both of them
because I will hold them up they're so
similar so 25 a and 25 B but they look
like almost identical so yeah hey when I
got both of those I really could have
just gotten one but you guys know I'm a
makeup junkie so I have two that is
everything I got for this clothing haul
I hope you guys loved it make sure to
