today's video I'm going to be doing a
massive clothing haul really do you

clothing hauls slap accessories slash
make those on YouTube so yeah let's just
get started into the video I hope you
guys enjoy it you guys like the video

it mean so much to me and also you can
join our little family have on youtube
if you want to subscribe and just hit
the little red subscribe button and so
let's get started I hope you guys
enjoyed it and a few like right now so
first brand I want to talk about is
princess Polly which I recently kind of
found slash heard of actually I was
sitting in science class next or my
friends who is shopping on the website
and also put branded by she's like oh
it's princess Polly it's just really
cute Australian shop and I was like oh
my gosh like I've never heard of it I
need to I need to look at it so that I
was just a scrolling through my emails
and then I saw those instances Colleen
and they actually emailed me and offer
extending them stuff so I got to go on
their website and just pick out a bunch
of clothing and oh my god is incredible
I believe it's summertime in Australia
right now so a lot of their pieces are
very spring and summer but I'm totally
cool with that because I'm honestly
really annoyed with winter shopping I'm
ready for the new season so with that
being said let's have a fabulous sleep
with Polly I know if you guys use the
code I'll be right here just my name
Olivia you can get 20% off if you want
their stuff it shows you everything the
start with is a Bonnie - I love bodysuit
and this one I haven't tried on yet but
it's kind of really cool it's just gray
but it kind of has like you guys can
kind of see in a camera that material
doesn't button at the bottom but it does
have the adjustable straps which are so
nice as we don't examine brands don't
adjust your chats because it's actually
easy and it like makes all the
difference so I really love this piece
by the way I'm going to try and go
through these pieces quickly because
there are so many and I don't want to
bore you guys but this is again supposed
to be like a massive haul so the next
thing I got is adorable but it's
basically this off-the-shoulder
long maxi dress and I think it's so
beautiful for the summertime
for the spring and for like tropical
vacations I know it looks a little bit
small right here but it does stretch a
great amount I also picked out a nother
long maxi it's the exact same thing but
just in red it's off the shoulders again
and then it goes all the way down I
really think for summer and spring I'm
going to be like absolutely obsessed
with maxi dresses they're literally just
so pretty and they just kind of add a
lot of elegance to look I picked out
three dresses with the exact same
pattern so I'm just gonna show those
first like the person was Maxie's then
into this cute little one is way shorter
and I guess you can wear it off your
shoulders but it spoke to kind of go up
so it sits on your shoulders and it is
so pretty I love it and then lastly for
that same pattern I picked this dress
and basically you just I showed or more
part so you tie it because it's not it's
not originally tied but you can tie it
to a little loop in the back and then it
just fits it kind of like a tank dress I
also got this really cute skirt I am
live for this I'm so excited to wear
this in the summertime
I mean first it has stripes it does feel
kind of heavy but it's so pretty and I
think it's going to look really great
with just like a crop sure it's cropped
white shirt or just a bathing suit top
like a white bathing to top in the
summertime yes please so now I'm going
to show you what I'm actually wearing
right now I kind of forgot that I had it
on it's just the sweater that I'm
wearing I got from rinses poly what I
love about this is the arm like it's so
big and fun so my stylist convinces poly
as well next I have these adorable jean
shorts I haven't tried them on yet I
hope they're going to fit there's 24 and
one will be 25 so we'll see but they're
just really ripped again summer I could
not wear this written out clearly
raining in LA but love it I also have
another pair of shorts these are really
pretty they're just white little shorts
with strings on the ends and I think
this is going to look beautiful in the
summer time again with the baby
to top or just like a nice little shirt
I'm just excited for summer I'm really
over cold of it for another power source
these ones are just black jean shorts
again I really hope these fit me because
I'm kind of on yet I love those
this skirt shorts bottoms kind of thing
fits perfectly and it's me cutest thing
ever
first off I love the color and it looks
like this in the box and you guys this I
got it in a size six and it fits
perfectly like it's literally perfect
so sometimes I'd say perfect take a shot
every time I said perfect
oh but yeah it's just the color and
everything it fits really well so I love
ordering stuff online and when it comes
to muscat hand or anything it's like fit
perfectly but perfect solar constant
ahh all super bottoms I thought this
denim skirt this looks like it might be
a little big but we will see I haven't
read the Sonya and not exactly sure how
it's going to work okay I'm excited to
see how that look and I think it's
really key pattern and then also the
same pattern you might notice I'm kind
of getting a lot of the same patterns
but it just kind of how about on your
website you just tired so at this point
you just kind of tie it it like sits on
you and then you tied around your
stomach about when I first saw this
dress from the mail I'd really don't
love it her how I felt about it
I myself to try it on and see if I like
it but it's just this little black it's
literally just a little black dress so
we'll see how it looks on if it looks on
it might be a keeper but other than that
it just might look the pattern right now
like off the bony looks a little
depressing so next I picked out a couple
of swimsuits because I felt their one
pieces were really cute so this one
compromising the details fell or
something really good referee again iris
has a thong but it's really pretty it
just looks like this next I have this
black one and I love this I just was
looking for a plain black baby suit and
a really low back this set kills me it's
matching shorts and a matching top of
course you know my obsession with shorts
these let just on their on their own
they're perfect but it has this adorable
matching time
talk and since I can like kinda plan it
it's so nice though like it's going to
look so pretty in the summertime
hopefully it fits me well I love it I
got this one in black and I also got it
in white and they're just like these
little tied crop shirt next up is this
dress I think this is stunning for
summer once again and it's just this
really pretty cream-colored it's kind of
like an off-white and then it looks like
this and it just kind of flows into a
high-low so it's high in the front and
then goes all the way down the back
something else I got was this cute
little romper and this needs to be
ironed but it does fit really well and
again it has a double strap okay so next
I got another bathing suit this one is
again striped shocking I like this color
I haven't seen it before it's kind of
like a green white pinstripe and then
the back again it's kind of low and yeah
I'm just excited to wear this in the
summer I don't know if one pieces are
going to be in in the summer I don't
really know what's going on I mean going
to be in my book I'm going to wear them
but a jacket early whew this next little
top dress situation I think if it looks
really cool over jean shorts it's just
like a cape it's kind of like a jacket
when it ties and I think it's really
flowy and pretty again for spring and
summer a lot of this stuff I can't wear
right now but I'm really excited to
eventually be able to pull it out and
wear it this jumpsuit fit but I feel
like if you're on the taller side this
might be a better option I don't know
I'm just kind of tiny I'm flat board and
this I just feel like would look
stunning if you have an really just a
tall body because I'll be I feel like it
makes me look like a little stumpy like
shorter it just ties under the goes into
pants it's just kind of like a jumpsuit
so luckily I got this romper thing and
kind of crisscross in the back and it's
v-neck I got this a really pretty dress
and I think this was going to look cool
over a bathing suit for Coachella
I don't know why I just think it well I
just talked about the black shirt a
couple pieces of the white also
picked it up in white it's the crop and
ties no look at great with teen shorts
in the summer time and these are like a
seat belt
speaking of belt I have two bucks but I
got miss miss miss Polly this first one
is just this giant belt I think this is
awesome
it's so big and then this next belt is a
little bit tinier and it's just gold and
it disrupts around like about wood and I
think they both miss pretty so so next
I'm going to go over some accessories
that I got adults we kind of sunglasses
the first ones are from T all cheering
it and they're just like these are
really big but kind of like so you can
see moving light but ignore that they're
just super kind of D belt I was going
like don't talk to me I have what I love
them I think they're so pretty and I
think thinking sells a lot for any
season and members just sunny out
another paragraph from Mickey belzoni
website is the collab we did with the
youtuber desi Perkins for desi hello
these ones are awesome they're just
these huge gold aviators I don't know if
there's a 90 read on my face
they're so big the third pair of glasses
are these like spec ones and they're
just normal kind of round
I'll probably get them all these
seventies I love this two more but these
are just like status looks yellow to
normal besides accessories and clothing
they also do shoes so I brought these
black Havaianas I think what I got me
this looks like not so probably I
wouldn't wear these like as an office
when I'm getting my nails done and my
pedicure I need just like plain
flip-flops so yeah extend my broken
socks offend my like pinky toe will get
caught love is just like the ideal shoes
for a pet here I also got two pairs of
vans
Nick first pair I've been wanting for oh
so long there's blue vans and yeah you
can see what they look like they're not
least up yet but they're beautiful and I
think they look awesome with
high-waisted jeans and then another
Caravan
are the same pair but in all white I'll
probably wear these a ton because
they're all white but I think they're do
science discoveries and clothing and
shoes they also have really good makeup
so I've heard a lot about Geoffrey start
products and I've never tried them so I
got asked in froth in the shade so I'm
younger viewers so I don't want to say
that word but it's just maybe what I'm
really paying it'll look nice but right
now on the fireside so I also got to lip
this is a celebrity skin and mannequin
that's really nice I really like this
packaging so the life are really
stunning just a nude pink and I got
let's see it celebrity something this
close to my skin oh I love this - ooh

different shades of juice but they're
both stunning one a little bit edgy a
little darker next I wanted to try this
benefit it's potent eye cream it smells
good peppermint ice cream there like

thing as well this so I'm so excited see

inexpensive especially I think they have
their own website too so apparently

try the shape so I could contour and
bronze miss game with it also got the
benefit dandelion Dew so this is their
blush but in a cream form and then I
also got to the hoola soft matte liquid
bronzer for the face I'm excited about

bags the benefit real sexy steel this is
like a little trio of the benefit

their eyeliner and the mascaras full
size Wow - it's all from princess Polly
I actually knows people at loving Tana -

one of their like applicators it's
called the black applicator and a user
has that stirred in my back for when I'm
tanning myself but out of the way I'm
going to get one myself just in case
she's not home yeah this is a mitt to
apply your tan to your back and it can
reach easy so that's wonderful
I have everything from Christmas Pauly I
