little bit later today it's June 6 it's
3:45 p.m. and I kind of just napped
today I haven't done much today actually
because I woke up really early this
morning and went to like an 8:30 workout
class and then I went to breakfast and
got my nails done and then I have
literally been asleep since then I
haven't even had anything to eat since
my breakfast like I had such a big
breakfast have been a full all day so I
think I'm going to try and hold it out
to like 5 and then just have a huge
dinner but am I go down and smack do
your little not Sophie yeah but I got a
package from Tarte recently they sent me
a PR package and I've never received
anything from Tarte that kind of been
dying to open up so I thought I'd just
start my blog with little haul in the
package the first thing I see is a
self-tanner with some tanning mint and
you guys know I love to help tanning
even though I'm a little bit 10 right
now because of the Sun and summer time
they sent me some gleam team
highlighters whoa
so there's a cream side that's so cool
and a liquid oh and they also sent me
quench lip rescue so see I love their
packaging it's so pretty
ooh that's really dark green omelette
that is really creamy definitely is a
lip rescue oven I don't and I still
absolutely not interested good my own
success what I don't have selected I
don't
so I just opened a bunch of packages
that I ordered from online and because
it's summer I ordered a ton of new
bathing suits so these two bathing suits
right here or from an Australian brand
called gypsy and don't you love it when
the front is the same size as the back I
didn't really have some tiny these were
so I don't really know what to do about
that and I don't really like this
pattern I thought it looked a lot better
on the website but I'm still going to
try them on I haven't even tried
anything on yet so this pattern is kind
of cool though and then these are all
from PacSun this is from LA hearts it's
like this really pretty mango bikini I
got these Billabong pants and then also
this la hearts black top this is
probably my favorite is from RISM I got
off Pakistan but the brand is rhythm and
it's just like the softest material and
I think it's a really cool pattern I
also have this um blue leaf pattern from
La hearts which I like and then this one
is also from LA hearts which I love and
I also got some things off of SOS so I
got these really cool black boots and
they look like this I love them I got
these adidas Stan Smith's and what I
think is really cool is you can change
the laces out for like this bright
orange which I'm definitely going to do
eventually I got these like cool
platform pink shoes though just ASOS I
thought they're just be fun for the
summer I don't really know just a shoe
that I can kind of like rough up because
they weren't too expensive and then I've
been really wanting one of these types
of hats so I got this hat and that's
about it
you know we are going to deny we're
doing mr. date spell and I are going to
dinner and we're going to get some sushi
got to look good look I swear to sit
right above my lip and it was so painful
and it popped it in the foot drying
cream I just have to put drying cream on
your bed after you pop it right away I'm
not entirely sure I brighten up a shower
as you can see it so these three things
are my life
of course margaritas go this lotion is
so nice and then also this coconut milk
I put in my hair and it's really nice my
skincare is complete so you can see have
a huge fit right there I really need to
edit video going to be quick though it's
my CIFOR video I think it will already
be up actually it might not be I don't
know when this vlog will go up but it's
my Sephora collection like summer get
ready with me video is out I already
filmed and edited the whole thing and
it's ready to go as you need to put a
thank you like something of movie like
thanks watching at the end there and it
should be good to go
okay so I just finished my editing that
literally took two seconds I just have
to see if it's good now I want to film a
video today so I'm going to probably
watch some YouTube videos take a break
since I've had a go-go-go morning and
then I'll probably get to filming why
does this camera never focus okay
filming it a little bit so later I'm
also going to edit parts of this vlog
and see like what I have and what I need
I like it would probably have no footage
but hopefully there's something I'm
praying I'm just watching YouTube okay
baby J they're like the cutest little
family I've ever seen if you don't watch
them I actually just started watching
them like I'm not suggesting a couple
months ago but they're so cute they're
like Teufel family and they two little
boys and they're just like the most
precious brushy things in the world it
honestly makes me one of the family like
I'm 17 so I knew to chill but they're
really cute so if you're looking for
like a good family vlogger and everybody
always asking me to vlog more but you
know I'm really bad of lobbying they do
daily vlogs and they're really good at
it so say if they see this they're going
to think I'm actually crazy and creepy
but I swear I'm normal
when you're friends those aboard here
you keep recording
you're a nosy okay you jeans are from
Olivia's closet okay somebody they were
to follow me
they're from revised denim they look
super cute and hipster on there

yeah I am a newbie I lighted yeah I look
so awkward shoes are from those in
cheese they're like oh I don't have a
brand it's like stole face I'm mental

bucks so my jeans are only buys they're

to wash off my makeup and go to bed I'm
up early tomorrow I'm doing a workout
class at 9:30 or 9:00 and when we go out
to check but it's not too late and I
think it's midnight like it just might
be 11:30 not really no I'm just going to
watch me make up and go to sleep so I
think I'll probably up to Baltimore I
don't think I've enough footage but I'm
going to edit and see where this is so

know why it's on my lip it's like the
most annoying spot in the world ever get
it sorry I'm just putting my blinds up
in the bathroom but yeah it's really
annoying and it looks really weird now
that I'm on here as you can tell I was a
bit of a mess just a little bit no big
deal um so I kind of need to clean
okay I'm sorry I'm using my phone by the
way my memory card ran out of space I
just have to put a new one in but that's
my makeup I still need to find a better
way to organize it that needs to be
organized at all jump and then I have
all my sunglasses up here I mean this
will do for right now I have all the
cases there and then this Marc Jacobs
sauce is completely empty but I feel
like it would just be it's just a fuse
box and it's like it could be really
good for storage like I could eventually
put my sunglasses in there or something
so if you have any ideas let me know and
then I put all my purses up there with a
memory box and I just moved all my tote
bags and stuff up here because like I
don't really go into them too much so I
thought I could just pop them over there
