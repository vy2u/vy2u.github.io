today's video is in a different
background as you can tell I'm gonna
hotel I am in Mexico right now it's been
nothing short of amazing
and today's Friday I got hit today but I
remembered another video film for Sunday
so I want to kick it back with a QA I
don't have all my proper equipment to do
lick makeup video or anything like that
but of course I still wanted to put up
something on Sunday and I know you guys
love when videos are a little bit more
personal so that's what's going on and I
literally was just with all my friends
on the beach and then I was like wait I
have to go film I'll be back
so this is my experience I have at the
moment I was at the beach as I just said
so
yeah sorry if I'm looking a little bit
rough but I'm just gonna go straight
into the QA I asked you guys on Twitter
you guys can follow me there if you want
to be a part of future Q&amp;amp;A I also do
static units and Instagram Q&amp;amp;A so if you
don't want to be a part of it then you
can just follow me there I'll put like a
little picture of my socials but I asked
you guys with the hashtag ask Olivia
Jade on my Twitter and let's just dive
right into it and don't forget to
subscribe in my last video I was like
thanks for 500 thousand and ops as we
just hit 500,000 and then when I was
uploaded
I had six hundred thousand so sorry for
the confusion there but that is crazy
first one is can you tell me something
in Spanish I'll do a Jade love you I'm
in Mexico right now so I feel like I
have to Ola I'm gonna also white Oh
Mamo Olivia e yo s soy yo yo soy in
Mexico there's a problem entirely I know
a second Spanish who's your celebrity
crush Ryan Gosling for sure if you could
only attend one workout crash for the
rest of your life what would be it would
probably be either SoulCycle because I
love spinning or maybe Pilates because I
know that's really good for your like
muscles and stuff I don't really know
what do you see yourself doing in ten
years
I love you I love you too what do I see
myself doing in ten years probably
hopefully still doing youtubers around
but I'll be 27 in ten years so hopefully
like settle down maybe engaged
ready to start
actually now and we'll certainly enjoy
so my advice for incoming freshmen just
have fun life goes by so fast enjoy your
time as a freshman it just live it up
have fun enjoy your life it's amazing
what would you be doing right now if you
never started to YouTube I love you I
love you too if I never started YouTube
I have no idea what I would be doing I'd
honestly probably just be like well on
all I'm still in high school like
nothing really has changed I guess
except like friend wise but um I feel so
much so a lot has changed since YouTube
but you know I need like I'm still in
school I still with my parents all that
so I probably just be like um in school
living with my current like already what
I'm doing just like - YouTube how do you
stay confident and get this question a
lot and I think it's really hard to
answer because I don't know like half
the time I'm not confident I just this
year I really want to be a lot more
positive and happy and just like love
life you know what I need like I feel
like 2016 with so much as me like crying
and just being down on myself and just
feeling sad and feeling sorry for myself
about stupid petty things like I just
really want to like take life in in 2017
and just enjoy it and just be so blessed
and lucky that and healthy and then my
family's healthy and then I'm happy and
then I have an amazing life and that if
all of you guys and I think everyone
kind of needs to do that I don't know
how to stay confident necessarily but
I'm definitely working on it in 2017 and
I definitely think you guys should do
kind of weird like you have a favorite
name hmm
I really like the name Jackson but with
an ex I don't really know why I think it
looks kind of cool I love my sister's
name Bella
I think that's gorgeous I've so many
German name Oh what is the number one
thing you regret doing would you take it
back the number one thing I regret doing
probably in my life is just caring about
what other people think and I know that
can be kind of cliche and a lot of
people might say that I really really do
regret every pairing that people from my
youtube or that people didn't want to be
my friend anymore
people are golfing behind my back or
anything like that I regret some of the
decisions that I've made of course
dealing with all of that but
I don't know I think everything's our
learning experience I think that's the
one thing I would say I regret but I
glad it happened because it's just
taught me that this year's going to be
great and I'm going into this year so
much happier and more positive I mean
granted I'm looking at a notion as I'm
sitting here like this is insane I'll
show you guys at the end of the video
but I'm just really blessed and I don't
think it's good to train yourself and to
drive yourself down about regrets
because what you can control now is
what's happening in the moment so I
think you should take that and control
what you can and forget about the past
because everyone makes mistakes
everyone's human just forget it
that's my advice for that why you look
the same hot and then they put this
photo that's really funny I just don't
look the same anymore I was a waste
Guinea er in here like I don't have like
any structure to me good this look like
a lima beans lima beans pajamas but like
now I got boobs you know that's not bad
didn't happen in that photo I was like
contour or highlight cream contour butt
cream Ross I like being really bronzed
but also cream highlighting is kind of
my obsession like entities with your
favorite thing about your subscribers
love you my favorite thing about my
subscribers I don't think I can pick
just one because I love you guys so much
I know I read just like I have the best
subscribers I'm going to you know
compare you guys to anyone else so you
guys are so unique and cool and I'm sure
you subscribe to a budget for channels
but I can't even imagine like not having
YouTube and not having these amazing
people following me like all you guys
are so incredible and so sweet and so
supportive and I just kind of it's
really sweet because I feel like for so
long I've had so much trouble with
friendships and I feel like no one has
my back and it's really sweet to know
that like I'm over 600,000 people that
have my back
I feel like I'm very close with you guys
and I hope you feel that way too
even though i'm talking to a camera like
you guys it's kind of my life what's it
like having your mom be its famous um I
feel like I've my advantages and some
live streams before maybe it's not
really different for me obviously
because my mom is my mom so I would
never think of my mom and famous if that
makes any sense I hope that's
understandable like I don't think of my
mom like when she wakes up in the
morning or when she comes to wake me up
in the morning like oh my god
my mom's famous like she's my mom it's
the exact same as everyone else I think
that's so funny like the concept of
famous people is so weird me because
it's literally the exact same I mean
there's definitely some different things
around it and like like maybe there's a
little less privacy buh-buh-buh-buh Blob
fame has never crossed my mind one it's
like she's my mom she's my mom I mean
that's all I can really say for that
she's my mom so I think I'm going to end
the Q&amp;amp;A with that I know it was a little
bit short but I hope you guys enjoyed it
and if you guys like these videos give
it a thumbs up I love getting a little
bit more personal with y'all because
obviously I'm obsessed with you guys so
thank you so much for watching and thank
you so much for being amazing
subscribers and supporters I love you so
so much
and I'll see you guys next time bye oh
wait I need to show you to be a move
beautiful
well anyway as I was saying thank you so
much for watching I love you so much and
I will see you guys next time okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
