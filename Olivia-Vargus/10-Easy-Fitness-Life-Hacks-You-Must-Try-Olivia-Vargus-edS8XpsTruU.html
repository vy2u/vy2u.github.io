to my channel if you're new here my name
is live and you can do this every Monday
and Friday today I'm attending teens
natural lighting
so if the lighting changes it all
through the video I'm just so sorry in
today's video I'm gonna be sharing with
you 10 easy fitness hacks that you must
try I actually realized that I have all
these like little secrets that I've
never shared with you guys before just
because they're kind of like my own
little tricks and a lot of times I do
them subconsciously so I don't realize
that it might be helpful to tell some of
you guys when they are but these hacks
will help you improve your gym
performance they will help you get
motivated to go to the gym and they were
just overall helped you feel like you're
having a better workout for no extra
effort so without further ado let's get
into hack number one the first hack is
perfect for those of you who have
trouble getting motivated to go to the
gym I call it the 10-minute trial so if
you aren't feeling like the gym that day
go to the gym for just 10 minutes and
just do like 10 minutes of your workout
and just maybe walk for 10 minutes on
the treadmill like you can make it
really easy and after those 10 minutes
if you want to leave then you can leave
and you can say that you tried or if
after those 10 minutes you feel like you
want to keep going and maybe go even
harder then stay and do a full workout
this is so perfect I think I've only
ever left the gym twice after doing this
and it was because I was just like I'm
just so tired today I can't do this
but for the most part it just gets you
motivated to get there because there's
no pressure to actually have a full
workout you're like you know what I can
just do 10 minutes if I want so I really
recommend trying that especially you
have trouble getting motivated but at
the time this second half that I'm going
to tell you about is something that you
guys have been begging me to explain see
on my channel because I guess I never
really have and the half is wearing
converse on like day to the gym so the
way that I work out is I split up my
workouts between upper body days and
lower body days I alternate the two and
whenever I do lower body days I either
like to wear converse or bring them with
me in a gym bag but when I wear converse
to the gym on leg day the reason that
they are so effective and not not only i
but so many other fitness youtubers I'm
gonna fit as you do it I really know
basically it helps your feet stay flat
so that when you're doing workouts you
can engage your glutes more because
you're actually leaning
on your heels whereas Rana I wear like
my Nike Free Run run sometimes I'd lean
on my toes too much so by wearing a
sturdy flat shoe I get to really engage
my glutes but I just want to clear that
up you guys I'm not wearing converse all
running on the treadmill I'm only
wearing it for like squats deadlifts and
just things that I want to engage my
glutes for so the next hack I could
actually make a hole in a video about
give me a thumbs up if you want to see
that or comment it below but I don't
train abs
ever ever maybe here and there but I
basically engage abs in every workout
that I'm doing so when I'm doing cardio
I keep my abs sucked in when I'm lifting
heavy whether it's uh per day or lower
day I always engage my abs while I'm
doing the workout and I squeeze them
I've always just found albergue outs to
just be like a waste of time like doing
crunches and stuff so instead I just
engage my ab muscles while I'm doing
things like lifting like like what I'm
doing a squat for example and I have a
bar on my back when I push myself back
up I squeeze my abs in and that actually
gets a really good burn same with when
you're doing cardio keep your abs
squeeze in and you will get such a good
burn it's actually so insane like I'll
do compound movements at just plank
switch also engage your arms and your
abs but for the most part I just do
train abs I just keep them engaged and
everything that I do
the next hack is something I've been
doing my whole life and I didn't realize
that it was abnormal to someone said it
to me but I always chew gum at the gym
and I mainly chew them while I'm doing
cardio because I everyone I was running
a marathon when I was younger and all of
the people were chewing gum around me
and they said that it just helps your
performance and it honestly does because
I think it keeps you more like engaged
in focused in the activity and I don't
hear just a little bit more entertained
by chewing gum somehow if you don't you
that while working out I recommend you
try it I don't really know how to
explain it but just try it
the next Fitness hack that I do during
my workouts is I drink my BCA's so a lot
of people do this but I know a lot of
who also don't do this so I wanted to
say if you are someone who doesn't like
getting sore after a workout you should
look up BCA's which basically just help
to replenish
your muscles after you like tear them or
do something with them like even if you
just do cardio you can still do PCA so I
used to just drink these days after the
gym but now I do get throughout my
workout and it just helps you feel like
you're healing yourself as you're also
working out so it's just really nice
another easy fitness hack if you're
getting sore after your workouts is to
take a really hot shower thirty minutes
after your workout and this will relax
all the muscles in your body I really
think in hot showers at night time
regardless another really good half that
I have for getting motivated to go to
the gym is to start your gym playlist
before you go so if you can't get up and
get motivated to go and you're like
sitting on the couch start playing your
gym playlist and you'll get pretty amped
up as you're listening to it and this is
what I do every single day because then
I start to listen to a couple songs and
I start like dancing and like pop it
along you do it and then I'm like okay
I'm like I want to go to the gym and I
actually get like some work done right
now so then it's actually like really
motivating the next impact is how to
apply progressive overload since a lot
of people don't really know how to do
what I say is look as heavy as you can
for eight reps and then once you find
you're able to lift that same weight
until twelve reps increase the weight by
five or ten pounds and go back down to
lifting it to eight breaths so for
example if I'm doing weighted squats and
I have 60 pounds of my bar and I do
eight reps of those three times after
about three weeks I should be able to do
12 reps of those three times and so what
I'm saying is you should then increase
it either sixty five pounds or seventy
pounds and go back down to doing just
eight reps of those and then you just
progressively keep going up at your own
rate each time you feel that you're able
to the next talk I have is again
forgetting the store while you're
working out if you're doing something
and you feel like you're straining your
neck and a lot of times this is usually
one of armed days always push your
tongue to the roof of your mouth I don't
know how but it always just makes it so
my neck doesn't hurt as much
and workout and my last easy fitness
hack is for people who do not like
cardio or might not like running I
really recommend that you go slow on a
high incline incline is your best friend
so for example on the treadmill I put it
on the full incline and I just go out of
normal walking pace and you can do that
for 30 minutes and you will burn just as
many calories as a viewer to run on a
flat surface for a 30 minute it's not
like a normal speed so and the benefits
of doing that is that you're actually
working your muscles so that's how you
get really nice toned legs - you will
always ask me how I tell my legs and
it's by doing slow cardio for a long
period of time on a high intensity or
high incline so leave a comment down
