my channel but today's video is going to
be ten healthy habits that changed my
life and can hopefully help to change
your life too
I really really really believe in Sam
behind all of these tips that I'm going
to give you and they're all it from the
heart they're not like fake like put
cucumbers in your water like smell like
these are real this is what I've been
doing this on top of like a healthy diet
and exercise is 100% how I have like
felt about so I thought years so without
further ado here are my favorite healthy
habit tips that make sense so be number
one thing I want to tell you and the
most important thing probably is I
started drinking 3 litres of water a day
so I don't recommend if you're not used
to that just jumping on board like today
or tomorrow drinking 3 liters of water
I think gradually get to you know 3 or
wherever you are comfortable so before I
started my health and fitness journey
out drink water but not really in a
super conscious way like I do now so now
when I wake up in the morning as you saw
in like my morning routine video and a
lot of my other videos I drink a full
liter of water and now get my day
started and the best way that I can
recommend doing this is buying something
that holds one liter so I have a mason
jar and it's exactly one liter if I have
that in the morning and then after
breakfast I usually let my food digest
and then I have like the rest of another
leader a night dinner and then I have
the rest and I just gradually drink it
throughout the day but it really helped
me to kind of stop snapping and eating
so much in between meals because instead
of being like also longer it realized
that I was just thirsty and you use all
the time some people with whenever
you're hungry you're mostly thirsty you
just ate so I just recommend just err
measuring how much you're drinking and I
think 3 meters is really good
four liters equal quick gallon so 3 is
an exact me gallon but it's a lot of
water you know so I swear 100% that is
the source of the majority of my weight
loss which this video isn't about weight
loss by the way sauce healthy habits
we're on that health gains not the
weight loss if you wanna get this the
next toastie how is that I really
recommend trying is meal prepping so I
buy one week of groceries usually like a
Sunday or
day every week and so that all that food
will last throughout the week but I'm
meal prep three days out so that wait
scraps panel on a meal prep for all
seven days because by the time I into
the Sunday's will be good so I'm real
proud for three days and it's basically
just let me know that's what I'm going
to be eating exactly a lot of this
nutrition what to look forward to it
makes life easier like I wake up and I
have with meal prep like oatmeal and I
have for lunch I like I have a good meal
prep pasta and then for dinner I have a
meal prep sliced potatoes and like a
vegetable and then in between my snacks
usually have like fruit and rice cakes
and whatever else I feel like eating so
it definitely definitely makes a huge
difference rather than just like
scrimmaging me like looking at your
inner open eat right now and sometimes
you need reach for like what the cricket
sediment which isn't always the
healthiest and sometimes you know you
think eat and you eat more than a
serving size does this really helps you
keep with one serving size if you know
exactly what you're eating and I think
how does that schedule for your
metabolism it's also really helpful so
if you've never tried meal popping
before or if you've ever failed at it
comment down below let me know what you
think about it but I really love it the
next healthy habit is going to be more
like a psychology tip and basically I
started to recognize what I was doing
that was like a reoccurring bad habit
that would always caused me to go in the
opposite direction of my goals for
weight loss and like being healthy so
for me because it's different for
everybody but for me I'm an emotional
eater so I should be doing really well
for a week and I'll have something
happens to me and I get really emotional
I need comfort food and that's when I
just like completely lose it I wear it
and I eat anything that I want anything
that sounds good and that for me is
about habit a lot of people are bored
eaters some people skip meals and that's
just as bad we were in table ilysm so do
a lot of fat houses out there that
revolve around food and just like so
so if you can tackle if you can target
what those are that's the first step and
the second step is replacing your coping
mechanism with something more healthy so
for me yesterday I had some bad news and
I was into me like I need comfort food
if I want cookies
I want pasta like what I want like vegan
mac and cheese and I want everything bad
no internet are
you go better instead of doing that I
kid you not I went to the gym like I
want to be doing for an hour and I read
this in the book what someone said that
there was reach for cake and they were
police it was walking three miles and by
the time they got past me through my
walk I didn't want to cave and that's
exactly how I feel yesterday like I
finished my workout and I was like I
feel like I got their position and I
feel like I got a lot of my anger out
and then I just want to continue to be
on the road to better positivity and
like choices I don't want to like take
one bad you can make it into it to bad
things and like more about this and just
like hating myself the end of the day
the next healthy habit that is
incredibly crucial is limiting how much
you eat out so I used to eat out only
once every day and not only did it suck
for my bank account but it stuck to my
body my metabolism because you can't
read all of the ingredients that are
going into your process to the day
you're getting a restaurant you don't
know how much oil they're adding you
know so Neil obviously how much like
sugar they're adding the things you'd be
really surprised because the restaurants
are in the business of like making food
that tastes good to other people they're
not looking for your health but they're
there even if you want to come back for
more so if you can limit how much you're
eating out and instead Enel stick to
your meal comes around the beef and a
lot of that is also social so you know
you want to hang out front but you don't
want to like not be able to go out to
eat with them because it's obviously a
really fun thing to do is go out say to
your friends and I put my favorite
things to do into and generally meeting
people at restaurants my going out to
eat instead I our place is going to
cafes and I love going to earth cafe
here like in Los Angeles who sees me on
snapchat Instagram some women all the
time
move all the way so slug um but instead
of going out to restaurants I go to
cafes because there I can just get with
this $3 green tea or like iced tea or
coffee or something and so I'm actually
getting the food I can eat beforehand or
can just snap there and it's so much so
much so much better for my wallet in my
body the next tip is going to also give
another psychological tip so I stopped
comparing myself to other people and
what they were eating and doing because
there are people with different problems
in this world so you can't look at
someone who eats like a piece of a just
well there's getting
you today like why can't I be skinny
easy today because that's such the wrong
mindset so what I started doing is every
time I said have that added no but you
know very well you need to feed that
your body will feel disgusting you will
feel so gross and like full they can do
it yes because they are a little
different person they have different
genetic different body seeing you know
humanity as my characteristics but
they're different so just think about
yourself do not prepare yourself to
others got it I'm going to say it again
in case you didn't hear me don't compare
yourself to what others do it's not your
life this is your life what are you
going to do to make yourself better so
my next step is going to be or not you
guys probably really hear me talk about
all the time but I am so addicted to
peanut butter and I had to stop buying
it because I would eat a jar a week I'm
so ashamed of myself so instead of
buying peanut butter I am now by tv2
which is a powder of peanut butter and
it just needs to be like a better less
low-fat way to get the changes peanut
butter without actually you thinking
about tacos all the time but yes I
recommend if you're like me and your
addition to any kinetic nuts or seeds or
just high in oils like anything that can
derive from an oil or like oil derives
from sweats on Doyle soybean oil any
nice you can take make into an oil stay
away from because they have the highest
fat content for and calorie content for
their like serving size so that's hella
anoying we have soy sauce kind of eating
things with like oil and all that and
I'm not so strict about it like I'll
still eat french fries when the occasion
comes but for the most part um I
definitely just stop buying my potato
chips and things like a high oil town
since I found some was just so not worth
it to me anymore
my next tip is one of my favorite ones
so I started reading nutrition labels
and my secrets of reading nutrition
labels is when you turn to the back and
maybe we look at the ingredients don't
look at mrs. Howard caramels off stuff
because whatever look at the ingredients
and you should be able to train your
brain to know what when you look at the
ingredients what the nutrition count
so if you're reading ingredients is
something and it's like got a lot of
different wheat products and obviously
it's going to be at a higher par medium
protein low bottom so you commute was
kind of like calculating in your head
that you get really good at it and I
loved doing it for some reason I love
reading nutrition labels and also being
vegan I think it's taught me to read
nutrition labels because I have to check
and answers eggs or dairy or obviously
meat and anything so that and also
whenever I turn over something that I'm
interested in evaluate how little
paragraph of ingredients I instantly put
down if I'm talking about like a
prepackaged salad or like just some
crackers or some hummus and it's like a
list of ingredients um no you need some
more ingredients the more processed and
sometimes I don't like a bunch of spices
and some things you know it's like okay
here there and in moderation of course
but I'm just speaking like every day
that when you look in like five
groceries look at the ingredients if
it's more than like the paragraphs do
not buy it the next tip that I have is I
started sleeping eight hours a night
so basically everyday when I go to bed I
look at what time it is so for example
if it's 11 p.m. and I'm going to bed I
know I'm probably not going to fall
asleep for another 30 minutes so it's
like 11:30 now and then I add 8 hours on
to that and I set my alarm for 8 hours
from then so like 7:30 a.m. is when I
wake up I'm going to get eight hours of
sleep my body feels so refreshed and
renewed the next morning so I just
recommend doing that Pacific just just
your body is single reset if you don't
think that you're getting eight hours of
sleep or you should be getting probably
to make eight or nine hours of sleep
every night and even if you want about
at 4 a.m. like you need 8 hours of sleep
so if you're going to go to that forum
you better be responsible enough to know
that you don't have anything going on in
the morning that you can't see and I
know like being teenagers and if
especially if you're starting school
again sooner you have a job it just
comes down to being responsible and like
valuing like your health and like
well-being over like the lots of sleep
so our next tip is I made going to the
gym enjoyable myself and the way I did
that is I didn't at first but pressure
myself to let go and have a hard workout
I was going to a lipstick or go on a
steady like medium page for 30
minute and watch YouTube videos and so
that way inland I could be doing this at
home on my couch or I could be burning
some calories and like feeling ass and
getting my heart racing it also doing
this at the same time so if you have
access to elliptical or a treadmill or
just walking outside but make it
enjoyable just watch some YouTube videos
make it in there you look forward to so
the last tip I'm gonna share with you on
how I like healthy and everything the
past few months is I stopped eating
three hours before going to bed and
usually that falls around like 7:00 8:00
p.m. I kind of stopped eating so it's
just better because your stomach will
digest the food before you go to bed and
then you can sleep wake up refresh and
also in the morning I'm not like super
hungry for breakfast right away so
that's why I work out and then I have
breakfast or we'll have like a bit of a
snack maybe some fruit maybe like some
rice cake so that's like my favorite my
go-to it's like some PVC on top like
before my workout there's a lot in that
no one's different but I don't eat like
late at night and I don't eat like hella
early in the morning that is Justin to
