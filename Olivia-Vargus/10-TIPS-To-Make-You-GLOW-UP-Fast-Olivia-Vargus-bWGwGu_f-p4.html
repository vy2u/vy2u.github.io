to my channel if you new here my name is
Liv and today we're gonna be talking
about how I glowed up I would like to
consider myself an expert in this topic
because um yeah that was me it's been a
long and journey I would say to get to
where the point I am now I'm at a point
where I'm really comfortable in the body
that I'm in and I'm really happy with
all the progress that I've made I'm in
no way trying to sound conceited in this
video or being like oh my god I was so
ugly and I'm so hot I'm the shit like no
I'm not runnin down like that no I'm
just saying that I have gone through a
lot to kind of like find out what makes
me feel like my best it makes me feel
like a most myself and best in my skin
so I want to share with you guys kind of
the journey that I've been on and like
what kind of things that I really felt
have improved the kind of person that I
am so these tips are going to be a
mixture of both inner beauty and outer
beauty tips that I have put together for
you guys and I think I have about ten
which is a lot good I like this list I'm
excited to get into this video also feel
free to follow me on my social media
before we get started you can like stalk
my Instagram but we're going through
these things if you want to scroll and
see like the actual progress of like my
appearance yeah everything will be down
below and I'll just get into the video
because this is what you're here for the
first thing that I have on my list of
how to blow up is really basic and I
really recommend this every month at the
beginning of the month I rate a
manifestation list so this month for
September I wrote down that I once have
good skin good hair good nails good body
I wanted to be a better balancing work
insight I wanted to be more organized
and Oh intellectual growth so I wrote
down on my mirror so that I see it
everyone when I'm getting ready and by
seeing that and manifesting it it helped
me to pay attention to those aspects of
my life I recommend writing down what it
is that you want to blow up before you
even get into it like the details of it
so do that find out what it is that you
want to improve
yourself make it realistic and give
yourself a set time frame and then go
from there so the next thing it's gonna
be one of my favorite tips that I did to
blow up what does I changed my hair so I
was changing my hair for a while with my
own like at home box I kids my parents
never let me down my hair growing up
when I lived at home and then when I
went out I decided I was gonna dye my
hair with box kit so yeah that's what
happens when your parents don't let you
dye your hair you take things into your
own hands
so it took me a long time to figure out
what I wanted to do with my hair but I
always like I was always really torn
between having dark hair and having
light hair so I end up doing ombre which
is what I have now so that I have both
dark and light but I like this because I
don't have to change my eyebrows I don't
have to make them blonde because my
whole head isn't blonde so I recommend
just trying different things you know
you can box our hair it's totally
reasonable it's really affordable and it
kind of funds take matters into your own
hands long as you're not like being
stupid with it like have like someone
help you I did it so really a lot of my
bathrooms like I'm not one to talk or
give advice about this but anyways yeah
definitely like change your hair up and
your life will change dramatically like
cut your hair I hair extensions like do
something different with it
straighten it for the first time curl it
for the first time girl you need to take
care of yourself like what you're doing
so my next step for growing up is to
influence some sort of physical activity
into your life you don't want to go to
the gym or start like a super physical
like workout routine but even just doing
like 5 or 10 minutes a night or every
morning of just I work out let's watch
some yoga videos just doing something
and you want one 100% feel a little bit
better and outer beauty begins with
inner beauty of course so when you do
things like that you feel a lot more
confident and just a lot more energized
and like healthy so when you do that it
affects a lot more than just your
appearance but also like your mental
state so I really recommend just trying
to implement like something a little bit
everyday that you enjoy key part is you
enjoy it and you'll feel so good and
you'll look so good my next tip to glow
up is to try meditating so this one is
like - a lot of people they're probably
rolling their eyes like oh I'm not that
it's okay
this bitch is crazy she's like one of
those hippie dippie people for like no
if you try meditating for just again
like five or ten minutes every couple of
nights of the week and just sitting
there in silence without your phone on
just really like feeling your breath in
the moment you will feel such a sense of
calmness and just it's a really great
way to de-stress and get rid of your
anxiety and it's also a really great
form of discipline and to be successful
at anything in life you need to practice
methods of discipline because you can't
really get anywhere in life unless
you're like conditioned to work hard and
to do things at moments when you might
not really want to do them example
working out but sometimes they don't
feel like working out and I don't feel
like meditating but I force myself to do
it and I always think myself I've never
worked out or meditated or done yoga or
anything that afterwards you're like oh
I regret that but if I don't do those
things then there's more of a chance of
me regretting not doing them and of
course when you de-stress and you're
less interest you sleep better you have
better skin overall more of a glow and
better health so the next two tips are
super random compared to what I just
said but the first one is understanding
your skin tone so for a long time I
didn't understand that I have like a
cool toned skin and I was using products
that were for more warm tone skins and
you can watch youtube videos about this
stuff but basically for a while I was
using like dark brown contours and then
I discovered legitimately this week that
we honest fending contour can't let me
show you the fancy beauty contour kit
that I got which is in the shade of
light 100 has a contour stick that is
it's the perfect shade for my skin
because it's a cool tongue Brown I'll
swatch what I was using before and you
can see the huge difference between a
cool tone and a warm tone Brown and so
finally your skin tone is and then which
one will look better on you and that
will change everything for you but
change the game and similarly I want to
say that if you have dry skin you should
be using a dewy foundation and if you
have oily skin
to be using a matte foundation I have
dry skin and I'm using a matte
foundation which I just also realized is
definitely not like a smart thing to do
so if anyone has any recommendations for
any dewy skin foundations leave them
down below so I'm really looking for
some more I only use cruelty free brands
so please let me know if you have any
recommendations below but I wanted to
share that pro tip with you guys because
I feel giving some huge difference I'm
so bad at planning my life out and it's
like literally sunset but we're still
going so my next go up tip is to give
yourself positive affirmations I do this
either in shower or while I'm brushing
my teeth because I'm not distracted by
my phone or anyone talking to me it's
just me and I can really like have a
moment to myself and I can just list
things that I love about myself or I
love about life at the moment and by
doing that you're kind of just
attracting positivity into yourself and
that will help glow of course so think
about all the things you're grateful for
for example you could say things like
just tell yourself like you're beautiful
you work hard you're doing really well
like keep going you're gonna be great in
life like just give yourself as many
positive affirmations as you can't like
it might feel uncomfortable first time
you do because you're like is this arrow
game but no you're just giving yourself
love so you can shine brighter and like
be happier and like thus be confident
and have like a glow up because like you
can't you can't blow up and so like your
inner beauty is like also blowed up you
feel the next pro tip that I want to
give you guys is to pay attention to the
expiration dates on your beauty products
so that you're not using things that are
crusty and old and covered with bacteria
so for example if you have an eyeliner
or mascara you can look on the tubes and
they will show you like the amount of
time that you have after opening the
product until it expires pay attention
to those dates and then don't use the
product once it expires because because
then it's just not gonna perform at its
full ability that you bought it for so I
definitely recommend replacing your
products every time they expire cuz for
a while I would use the same mascara for
like half of a year or your
and it just wasn't it just a little cute
the next tip is also something that I
just discovered and it's called
dermabrasion I think I said that right
if I didn't I'll write it down basically
you can get this done at a spa or a
dermatologist or I don't just look it up
where you can get it done but I got my
own dermabrasion thank you $1 from
tweezerman at Ulta basically what it is
is that it it's the same thing it's
exfoliating your skin you're just
removing a layer of dead skin but look
into it and I really think that it
improved my skin's overall texture and
overall brightness because they got rid
of all of my dead skin and a little bit
of the peach fuzz on my face and that
helps makeup go on better and it just
helps you look a lot brighter so I
really recommend checking out any
products like that I like doing that I
got from tweezerman or you can just go
to a spa and get it done there because
that works too it's just we weren't
expensive the absolute last tip that I
want to leave you with is to surround
yourself with good friends and good
people who make you feel your best and
don't have surround yourself with people
who make you look your best you know
what I mean you know what I'm saying
surround yourself with people who you
could just throw your phone away with
when you're with them because you're
just having such a good time
surround yourself with people who are
the kind of people that will not judge
you if you eat 10 pizzas vegan pizzas
and 10 kinds of ice cream and then ask
them if you still look beautiful they
will tell you that you look beautiful
every day because they're your best
friends and they're a better support you
shout out to all my needs and best
friend said hello and that keeps me
motivated and that I get to surround
myself with every day including my mom
my best friends so yeah just definitely
that's how you shine your best is when
you're surrounded with likes people also
shine at their best and you can all
mutually uplift each other so I really
hope that you guys enjoyed my glow up
