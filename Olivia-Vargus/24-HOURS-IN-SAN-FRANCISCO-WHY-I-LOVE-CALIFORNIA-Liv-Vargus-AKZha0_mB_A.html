great lighting blogger inside so Ali and
I are in San Francisco at her house
obviously I'm stayed for 24 hours and
then I'm fly back to LA tomorrow and I
was from the blogs a day and I San
Francisco at least one was so cute she
literally bought this granola for me
last night so that I could have it in
the morning it's like a vegan granola
and I put out these blueberries and like
made me coffee also look at this view
Wow gained their trust and affection we
get so distracted doing things like it's
already 12:20 and we haven't left
because we just like went outside and
picked this orange we literally picked
this orange from Ali's tree and it's
perfect but I woke up and the first
thing she said to me she goes I had
three bowls of fruit loops this morning
and I was like can you explain that me I
was taking such a big bite that I like
scraped the roof of my mouth
she says ruff not roof and it was like
like my the roof of my mouth hurts like
so bad she's literally been saying all
morning she's like the roof of my mouth
is so burnt and I'm like oh like you
burnt it she's like no like the fruit
loops scratched it
this is my favorite view on earth if I
was you I would literally just stand out
here all day and just look down the road
and be like wow
we just got through a fourth street in
Berkeley is that what you called it I'm
at this place in Berkeley with Ali
called our teeth and we both thought
vanilla iced lattes I'm really not sure
wearing yellow with my hair anymore like
you did when I had dark hair but now
long-haired I feel like I let you run if
you gon come I lattes in San Francisco
and that's my god and so then it's
better than that look at this photo
Ali just proposed oh it's them
we just moved outside cuz I'm landing
out here is really good to take some
pics nope
I said ever gonna move wait a sec slide
to change the lighting okay we click on
you wait how close I think we're at like
downtown Berkeley or something like
where are we
I really never know where we are and
we're going to shopping out like a
couple of these places that are really
cute that I likes a lot yeah we've done
a lot of fish jumping on this trip
together these shorts are my brand new
drifted short ally and I just bought
these matching Berkeley shirts at this
store and they're so cute we're going to
take some matching between pics in them
and we're in the bathroom at Chipotle to
change and I think we're gonna go get
food at this like vegan diner that Ali
is that is really good and it's right
next to City Hall like yeah no I've
already rehearse in our mind still
speaking
sweet and she got so sick
you guys are so like what she said in
fine shape in the passion just like I
was like if you desert on us and like
that so we have been to a city hall I
got better because we have this plan but
like it's literally so sweet of her so
she's bringing cupcakes and like our
report done it's here
oh he's nothing roughy one and that's a
red velvet one
I think it's so funny that a we got
three desserts from Saturn we so when I
got in a holic because we really really
wanted it we're gonna take it to go and
eat it while watching the sunset and
then see everyone's like trying to get
in shape right now for Coachella and
like just bringing everything everyone's
like go to like work out and I'm like
literally over here like it's honestly
sick season for me
you
I hear they see anything right now but
this is where standing to come say hi
Asha
Berwick Ali's friend Asha from San
Francisco and we're watching the sunset
this is
because my cameras know that actually
otherwise probably charged a little bit
by now hopefully getting up though it's
10 o'clock which is actually really
really late this is later then I went to
bed last night and it's probably like
for I am that means in London I look so
crusty and dad you just get the funny
we're like little potatoes oh I don't
want to leave her tomorrow I was like I
can't believe tomorrow you know wake up
and like I'm gonna wake up and moving
around here but no it kills me that I'm
gonna like not be around her like every
second of every day once I get back
we've seen each other every second of
every day for like a week straight now
but like I mean you can correct me if
I'm wrong but I'm not sick of you no I'm
not yeah this is kind of crazy like I
get weird I usually think I hang out
with like other people for like 20
minutes and I'm like I need to get out
of this like with a leaner like the same
person kind of weren't actually complete
opposite yeah we're literally yin yang
so like that's how it works let me walk
around like that for a good probably
more than an hour like what the is
going on so many pets don't understand
why like my two best friends would let
me do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
