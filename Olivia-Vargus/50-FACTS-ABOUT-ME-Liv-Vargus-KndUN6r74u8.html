is Liv I make new videos every Monday
and Friday and if you want to subscribe
and join my family I'm not gonna stop
you my upper lip is so swollen right now
because I did this like I don't want to
talk about it but it's it's just really
swollen right now I'm hoping it will go
down I'm just gonna show you what I did
there's these things that you can like
put on your mouth that off them off
Amazon and it like plumps your lips and
I left it on while doing my hair and it
like boohoo Heatley made my upper lip
swell I just had to address that because
I don't want to get text for my mom
where she's like did you get lip
injections like no I tried to do it
myself at home and this what happened
whatever so this week I'm actually
feeling a little bit under the weather
it's just been like a weird really weird
off week and the video idea that I had
for today I fell through but I still
want to put something up so I'm just
gonna film this video 50 facts about me
I've been seeing a few people doing this
it's like a lot of people do Alexis run
just sittin and it's other girlfriend
here right I just said it I might have
just said her name wrong but I thought
that it would be like a good like pretty
chill easygoing video that I could film
and I hope that you guys like it feel
free to comment a fact down below about
yourself so that I can get to know you
better
maybe it's like your favorite food your
favorite color or where you like live
where you want to travel to anything
that you want to comment down below like
let's all just like share facts about
each other I'm gonna share 50 facts
about myself so let's get into it oh my
god this starts out so weird oh my god
okay so my biggest pet peeve is when my
hands are wet and I can't drive peanut
butter is my favorite food of all time
following that I think that acai bowls
with peanut butter is like the best
combination of her I used to want my
first tattoo when I was 18 years old to
be of a piece of bacon and now I'm vegan
why did I want that like that's I'm so
weird
my favorite show of all time is Teen
Wolf I took piano lessons for a really
long time and I stopped in like high
school but I'm really good at it I truly
think my personality
is an antisocial extrovert like Kendrick
Lamar said in his loss I only wear
silver jewelry I don't I don't know why
I don't wear gold jewelry I actually
don't have a favorite color and I don't
know how other people choose their
favorite colors like my favorite colors
of the rainbow my biggest insecurity is
that people aren't listening to me when
I talk because I'm really talkative but
then I'm really sensitive that like no
one's paying attention if I could live
anywhere in the world right now I think
I would move back to the East Coast just
because I think once you an East Coast
girl you're always a nice ghost girl I
think you're pretty loyal to the coast
that you grew up on to be honest I
actually said that's so weird Lee
actually took surfing lessons when I was
younger and I was naturally really good
at it but I'm so afraid of sharks and
open water that I probably will never
surf again
I've worked multiple jobs since I was 14
years old but most of them were in like
the restaurant like industry be the host
being a waitress anything I'm pretty
much allergic to avocados my anniversary
of being vegan every year is on Cinco de
Mayo I have a beagle back home named
freckles who is 11 years old and we
named her freckles because when we
picked her out she had freckles all over
her paws and stomach when I'm older it's
my dream to buy my parents their dream
cars I have one older brother and he's
two years older than me and he has he is
100% the favorite child who I'm from
Cape Cod Massachusetts and I will
forever value my home on that beautiful
little islands in my little childhood
that I had there when I applied to
colleges I only applied to one because I
was so determined to go there and
nowhere else like I wasn't gonna settle
for any other school following up to
that I'm notoriously determined and I've
never failed at anything because I
simply never stopped trying so even like
when I do fail I don't stop trying I
just keep going so it's kind of an
annoying personality trait but it's done
to do well and then following up to
those when I was younger I promised
myself that I would move to California
for college and Here I am I'm really
into numerology and the study of how
numbers affect just life in humans and
if you're
one during my number sign or birth sign
is thirty 3/6 I've been told by
countless people that like I'm the
biggest over-thinker which I knew on my
own but my brain goes out like a million
miles a second and so many people
haven't totally that which is weird
because like they're not even the ones
in my head but they should hear this
 I go through really obsessive
phases over dumb stuff week after week
and my roommate knows this about me and
I'm I'm just sorry I'm actually a really
big neat freak and everything has to be
cleaned around me I'm really selective
about who I spend my time with because I
don't believe in forced friendships or
being liked by everyone that you meet I
believe in just having few people that
you really value one of the best choices
I ever made in life was deciding to fall
in love with fitness and when someone
else worded it like that when they said
I'm gonna fall in love with fitness
that's what sparked me to fall in love
with fitness because I viewed it in a
different light I viewed it in a light
of love and instead of in a light of
fear that I had always had for it so I
also really loved nutrition and the
science around it I've always been
really into photography and like
learning how to work a camera
I'm 25% Greek if not more I have played
tennis and field hockey my entire life
except for after graduating high school
I'm really good at reading people and
sensing their emotions people have
always told me that like I'm the person
that they feel like they are most
comfortable like exposing themselves to
and like going to for advice which is
really sweet I really like that
Christmas and fourth of July are my
favorite holidays okay also I'm a really
sentimental person and I love family
traditions
I hate mangoes so much I'm
extremely talkative like really
talkative every time I meet people that
have like watched my videos online in
person I don't think that they expected
me to be so delicate over like I will
talk really 20 minutes and I feel like
they're like we didn't know this about
you I've never been really in some
materialistic things like I like
shopping and I like find my quality
things but I've always kind of felt like
money is just this like uncomfortable
thing that's not really like necessary
to my being I just like hate when people
flex on my
like that's all social media influencers
seem to be doing these days you will not
see that here we're not about that I got
into YouTube really young because my mom
didn't wear makeup and I needed somebody
to teach me how to wear makeup so shout
out to all the beauty bloggers that I
watched in seventh grade I took classes
in French all through high school and a
little bit in middle school but I don't
remember any of it I don't even know how
to say anything right now like sorry
just wait do I love outdoor shopping
malls I don't know why I'm definitely
more of a nature person instead of a
city person but I have been living in a
city for two years someone get me out of
here
I love interior design and architecture
it's like my guilty pleasure the first
thing that I notice about people is
their energy I have always loved the
look of stretch marks before anyone told
me what they were like I've always just
thought that they were so cool to a
spider web pattern on your thighs I
don't know I think they're really cool I
have one tattoo of a white heart on the
back of my neck that I got when I first
moved to California when I missed my dog
because she has a white spot on the back
of her neck so I got it for her I swear
a lot and I'm so sorry because I
I don't think people expect it from me
and then also I always forget that like
it's kind of insensitive and some people
get upset about it I'm not really into
drinking or smoking I'm already kind of
weird enough as a person when I'm sober
so when I'm intoxicated it's just a mess
so we kind of avoid that I do hope to
get married someday but I can't find
anyone to love me so what the
my favorite quality that I look for in a
guy is humility I love desserts baking /
cooking any day so I'm hoping that this
video will be fun to look back on in a
few years see if I've changed all like I
said comments on below a fact about
yourself so we can all learn about each
other I hope that wherever you are right
now in the world you are having a
beautiful day and that your day is
filled with all sorts of love and just
divine energy and I hope that your
weekend is amazing and you set the
intention to make it that way and I will
see you guys later I love you so much
I mean it and I'll see you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
