reminds me of the balloon from it I
never even watched that movie but look
at it has a mind of its own it's like
scary so this is what I saw when I woke
up this morning which is so cute like
this is my dream come true we don't know
how to work this AC at all thank you no
shade to my mom or anyone my mom this
morning was like a little jealous that
like Ali did such a good job but it
looks so so cute we should suck the
helium out of the balloons good idea so
then look at this and then in here she
got me a little cake throw a wig vegan
does it say in the box with a firmer do
more the name of it yeah yeah that's
what it's called so what were these this
is a coffee donut like from bull cake
yeah that's like a brownie cupcake and
then a cookie which looks really it was
a good dog treat so I just finished
getting ready and I curled my hair today
because I usually straighten my hair
everyday so I wanted to do something
different with it
and I like came in and she was like oh I
like your hair and I was like things I
curled it and she was like really I've
literally never felt like so much love
from like somebody well my birthday
before like this is literally like
mind-blowing to me so I pretty much
finished my hair and makeup I just have
to pick out an outfit but I'm wearing my
robe right now this from Ikea people
need to know I don't know why like I saw
it they're not sick I need that so what
this morning I woke up and I wasn't
gonna blog today but then I just was so
overwhelmed with like all the love and
everything I was like I need to remember
this like I was gonna put up just like
all my Instagram stories for the day but
just something feels better about
vlogging I think it's just like a second
nature to me to like vlog so I just like
I have to vlog did I have to use my 21st
if you didn't know I like can't go
through and like thank all these people
but like I want to say thank you it's
like everyone oh my god who's sending me
happy birthday messages it's so kind so
I think just for breakfast I'm gonna
wear white as bran
like lunchtime now I'm just gonna wear a
super basic outfit because it's just
like when I'm comfortable in and I'm not
like a super fancy dress up person so
it's just all pretty much all of this is
Topshop or brandy melville and in my bag
I have this romper that I brought to
Coachella to put on when we get to the
beach or like for picks and then to
bathing suit options because I don't
know which one I want to wear yeah I got
makeup on me camera okay just an update
I put this black Urban Outfitters tube
top on instead I thought it was more my
vibe and also a little tip so these
shorts are normal but if you roll them
they look a lot better yeah so this is
my last outfit change I swear we did
this last year on my birthday we both
wear denim the same like denim shaded
jeans and black tops so this is like a
tradition now zoom in oh it's so slow oh

your car-door
