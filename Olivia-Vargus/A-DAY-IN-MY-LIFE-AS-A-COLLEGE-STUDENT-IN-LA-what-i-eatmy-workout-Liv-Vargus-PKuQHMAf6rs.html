rough right now I just woke up um it is
like 8 a.m. in the morning and usually
my roommates not home on Wednesday
mornings but she does beer so I'm like
bitch why but I'm gonna be vlogging a
damn I like College today I'm gonna make
some coffee right out and trying to wake
up it is oh my god by the way if you're
new to my channel hi what's up my name
is live or welcome you can subscribe and
join my family if you want to
so I'm a college student in Los Angeles
California and I am in my third year I
am studying social media which is
basically just marketing but I have one
class today at 3:30 that I will take you
to since I just woke up I have a lot to
get them this morning in my classes and
start so later today right now I'm just
gonna drink my coffee and my water and
catch up on what happened while I was
asleep my face looks kind of swollen in
the morning I'm not a morning person in
the sense of like I can talk and have a
conversation would be like this is kind
of too much for me right now but I'm a
morning person and listens like I like
waking up early like I love it just like
don't talk to me it's not like a
category because I take it okay so I
just moved into my room just cuz I
wanted to like relax a little bit more
but I'm a pretty busy morning like I
said so I don't have a lot of time to
relax this morning but I just grab my
overnight oats from the fridge you guys
can watch my what I eat a days to see
like how I make these and what else that
I make and eat in a day yes bitch work
it do that so you can see this is my
to-do list today so actually this was
last night did that so today I have to
wait a block workout and then I was
gonna dye my hair purple not diet but
like tone it with purple shampoo but I
ran it up the conditioner I need you so
revisit that later that I need to do my
homework for this class I haven't done
yet and then go to this class and then
I'm pretty much done it's gonna be
beautiful the second I'm out of this
class I'm free
okay this is my setup right now and now
I'm gonna sit down and do my homework
I'm just having a couple of rice cakes
with some PB to that peanut butter
powder that you can make yourself before
I go and work out because I'm like very
hungry this morning and I need some
energy before I go
all right so now I'm gonna force myself
to go to the gym I'm so tired and I
don't feel like going but the way that I
get myself to be motivated to go on days
like today is one my pin tweet on
Twitter go check it out
but basically sometimes it just takes
myself getting up forcing myself to get
ready forcing myself to put on gym
clothing and just going and not thinking
about it because if I sit here and
second-guess it for like ten minutes
then I just won't go so if I just get up
without even thinking and put together
my outfit put together everything that I
need to my gym playlist my headphones
everything that I need and just start
walking to the gym then I go to the gym
like so basically I just don't even give
myself a second chance to like stop
myself and it's never as bad as I think
it's gonna be and I'm always happy when
it's over with so and it only takes me
about an hour in total to get it all
done with and then when I'm done I'm
done for the day and I feel so good for
the rest of the day it's definitely
worth pushing through those ten minutes
of doubting yourself before you go in
order to get their shop Tiger came
through with that email notification
because I got my gym shark leggings
finally I've been wanting these first so
long these are the seamless leggings
from Jim shark they're high-waisted
which I love and they're just so
comfortable and flexible so I'm so happy
thank you shop tiger not sponsored but
thank you for that email notifications
that I could finally get these
I'm here with an update I just took a
shower at my workout this morning felt
really great I did basically 30 minutes
of cardio which I love to do low
intensity but like long cardio sessions
I don't know if that's actually like
cold but that way I feel like I actually
work my muscles rather than like getting
my heart beat up actually it kinda just
both at the same time so it tackles two
things which I love you can watch my
busy girl workouts like see that and
then I will link down below the Gabriela
whited workout videos that I did that I
love I love her so then I just took a
shower and I did a coffee and coconut
scrub and then I just selfed hands let
me show you what I'm self-tanning with I
got the sensitive for a couple weeks ago
and I've already used almost half of it
but it's a spray tan water I wanted to
give it a try and I like it because I
can put it on really fast but the color
is a bit too orange for me because I
have two cool toned skin so don't know
if I'll repurchase but I still like it
for right now it's actually already 2
o'clock in the afternoon so I'm not like
running late but I don't have as much
time this morning as I was hoping to
have my homework is done and then my
workout is done that's all that mattered
and then I have class at 3:30 for lunch
today I'm making my meal preps lentil
pasta this has a lot of protein which is
great and then this is my favorite sauce
you guys have seen this some die what
I'm eating in my videos but I'm ill kept
three of these this is my last day of it
and I'm just gonna add this sauce and
microwave it to heat it up and then
throwing up a teeth oh my god the sauce
is literally my favorite it's vegan clam
peace the ingredient list is the best
I've seen on any sauce ingredient list
ever 10 out of 10 recommends actually
bought an extra jar this week into my
favorite pasta because my mom has been
trying to find this on Cape Cod and she
can't so I'm gonna ship it to her
because I'm a good daughter so I have
this new bed tracing and so now I can
like sit here and eat and like how much
able in bed this is probably my best
purchase of 2017 SOI
and right now I don't know why I mean I
guess it's the kids asleep in class day
but I'm wearing this yellow top from
forever 21 and these the spells from
zepho jeans are Topshop and I my Air
Force Ones on and I have a brandy
melville backpack on some going to my
SEO class it's at 3:30 it's three hours
long I ended up eating an extra two
sweet potatoes and like a veggie burger
before leaving because I was really
hungry and this classic he doesn't give
you long enough breaks to like go and
get food or eat so I had to make it
myself
pull a mom can you pick me up hold on
today's a pretty boring day like it's
kind of a stressful day I just have
class so give this video a thumbs up if
you want to see a finance like day my
life where I'm like actually
experiencing life to the fullest living
my best life in Los Angeles because
today I'm gonna be just like I woke up I
worked out now my box with three hours
okay we are dumb what not that was awful
I'm gonna walk to Target now it's like
three block walk and I need to get
aluminum foil because I'm an adult and
my new toaster oven is great and I need
to buy aluminum foil for it I'm in a
very populated area talking to myself
it's only 616 right now and the Sun is
already going down which is so sad to me
like I hate this I hate the winter for
this reason because I like when this one
goes out later so she cuz I just got out
of class so it's so sad because like my
entire day was spent inside doing things
but look at how pretty the skyline is
well DTLA is trash but like the concept
is real also so I didn't explain it
before but I have five classes and three
are online and if you follow me on
Twitter or an even on Instagram or
snapchat you know that like my online
classes have been quite the struggle so
just yeah I mean it's okay
a lot of people walking past it right
now another thing is that I don't like
wearing the color yellow or just like
bright like oh my boobs are out I don't
really like wearing bright colors like I
already said this is my how to say on a
budget video where I was like I only
going back and why because I like to
stay under the radar you guys I don't
really I'm not really like a social
person like I'm an extrovert but I'm
low-key and introvert which is why my
Twitter bio is antisocial extrovert that
literally sums me up high me again I
hate the city yeah I used to want to
live in New York City okay that's not
even my base they sort of live in New
York growing up and I just can't do it I
can't even do downtown LA like it's so
small and downtown is like a city it's
like a little tiny cluster of a city and
it's just so so awful so I've been a
pretty long walk just to get aluminum
foil
the line
this isn't
or the pretty skyline now because when I
get out of target it's gonna be dark out
but but this is the only part of
downtown that I like no joke
I'm so hungry right now I really can't
wait to get home and make dinner I told
you guys they ate two lunches before
class that I would be full the entire
time and I was but now I'm hungry again
so I'm gonna eat dinner so excited it's
like another like ten minute walk home
right now and then I'm gonna be gonna be
beautiful when I get to get home and lay
down and you guys classes are over for
the week I technically have homework due
for my online classes on Friday so I
have to do that tomorrow but for the
most part classes are over for the week
until Monday I am sorry oh my god Wow
I'm so grateful to be home right now
going to target alone is really not that
fun because I always get into
shenanigans and it's like really awkward
when you're alone but like when you're
with people it's like wow what a great
time at Target but when you're alone
it's like that's your target Hall
aluminum foil this is 100% recycled
I don't know how then I got some trash
bags these are called bio bags I've
never tried them but I was hoping for a
better option in plastic so they're
composable which is great I got some
cards to let people in my life know that
I love them that are across the country
and then I got conditioner basically
tomorrow morning when I wake up after I
work out I'm going to mix like 1/4 of a
cup of this with manic panics purple
hair dye and you know if you want to see
like a full haircare routine
let me know in the comments below and I
will give you one because I've been
trying to experiment with the ends of my
hair recently so basically I like dyed
my hair purple last week and it was
great but it washed out after like two
new showers so also I don't have a video
for Monday yet it's just like the first
time I don't have my life planned out
because I've had such a hectic life this
week but I'm thinking I want to do a
fall playlist video because those seem
like a lot of fun to film and it would
just be like kind of funny so I've been
loving a lot of you music lately but I
don't have anything in any playlists so
let me know if you want to see that and
let me know if you want me to make
playlist on Spotify SoundCloud or like
title or anything like I'll buy
subscription to any of those I don't
have any all I use right now
Apple music and I don't know how to
share things on Apple music so let me
know first of all where you want me to
make a playlists and then I'm gonna make
the video for you because I think that
would be so much fun okay so this is my
dinner it's just a sweet potato and then
some green peas with curry sauce over
the top I'm gonna eat this and watch
some YouTube okay so this is what my
apartment looks like both for I clean it
there's just kind of everywhere my
bedroom at night actually doesn't have
enough lighting but this is what it
looks like right now and I'm gonna clean
it really quickly okay so here's the
cleaned up version so I'm about to run
my dishwasher after I finished my water
I take the trash out everything looks
just a lot better to me and then my
bedroom has the worst lighting at
nighttime but this is what it looks like
so yeah probably gonna sit here tonight
I have some emails to respond to I'm
just gonna relax because I'm exhausted
like my body itself is exhausted I'm
taking my makeup off right now with my
mice flour water and cotton pad I love
using my flour water and to take off my
makeup because it like cleanses and
hydrates at the same time I also got
this rose petal witch hazel off Amazon
this week and I don't know what this
does I don't know what it's good for one
to use it pump a couple what with you
know anything about it I should just
look it up but everyone always talks
about which his witch hazel and I saw it
and I was like oh it's rose and did I
want it so I'm gonna put this on it's a
toner so what do you so see use that
next I'm going to take castor oil and
I'm gonna take a cotton thing and I'm
gonna put it on my lash line and in my
eyebrows and this is just supposed to
condition the follicles that um are in
your lashes and your eyebrows and it
helps them grow this is just how I'm
going to end my night and I'm gonna
write in my journal I think I'm gonna
read my book a little bit and I'm just
gonna relax because my body is so tired
I also just meal prepped my breakfast
for tomorrow but because I have a lot of
like dirty dishes I don't have enough
stuff to meal prep for the next few days
so I just have tomorrow and when I wake
up I'll empty the dishwasher and do that
I feel bad this morning I was kind of
like all over the place and it was like
more of a stressful log than more of
like a fun and like exciting vlog that I
liked doing so give this video a thumbs
up if you wanna see more vlogs subscribe
