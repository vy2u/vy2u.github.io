going to go upstairs on my roof and take
pic and then we're going to go and get
food so this morning we went on a hike
and of course like I did my week
involved I didn't bring my ball camera
because I didn't want to overheat so I
just brought so I just took a few ball
clips and I'll show you guys like the
hike and then the acetate afterwards so

mr. critic that the good those bird I
was so far away from the Carlo I was
trying to get that car rip to get in

mac and cheese and it looks just so so
good I'm crying inside oh my god you

I've never had such good mac and cheese
this is incredible what are your
thoughts on this seriously you guys like
my men show their ever I can't believe I
literally just ate my body weight and
vegan food this is why I always say I
can't go to all vegan places because I
order everything on the menu and like
did we not order a lot I turn that
attendant recommend not over like no I
mean fit look at the view from the Grove
up here I mean like there's a lot of
traffic but it's cute
wait where did Keanu go Thomas to go
snapchat so why you ever miss that I'm
too full to respond right now so ha
really when we ate like 10,000 calories
an hour ago we were just charging up so
that we could tackle the grill a
dead-ass said this morning that I did
not want to go shopping and Here I am
shopping
ladies and gentlemen welcome to okay you
guys I wanted to tell a quick little
story about this here fruit that I have
sold foods about a week ago and they had
like a bunch of Kiwi and then they had a
few of these fruits like in the middle
and for some dumbass reason my brain
resonated that as oh my god this is a
Kiwi like at this fruit right here in my
hand somehow is a Kiwi I got home and I
put this I only bought one because I was
like I just want to try one giant Kiwi
like literally put it down and I looked
at it out of context the next morning
and I was like my bro
that is not a cutie that is for sure a
mango but I'm gonna cut into this and if
it's a mango I'm going to cry how do I
even uh huh you oh it's a mango maybe I
can force myself to like it everyone
likes mangoes I'm like the only person
on earth who doesn't hey guys so it is
Sunday morning and I love Sundays I love
the energy that some days give I'm gonna
film a video later today but I got up
this morning did my makeup and then I
kind of just got a few of the things
together I want to do a little haul for
you guys let's start with Sephora we
spent an hour in Sephora so I ended up
picking up the Josie Maran
I think I said that Rosie Judy I have
fucked my life
it's her argan oil and this is supposed
to be really good and I put this on last
night before bed and it felt amazing
then I also got a new Beauty Blender I
already opened this and used it today
but I put it back in here to show you
guys I got it in the nude color and then
I picked up my favorite mascara which is
the Too Faced better than sex mascara
and then the next place that we did some
damage op was brandy melville so the
first thing is actually what I'm wearing
and it's this baby blue crewneck but it
zips up it's so basic but it's genuinely
so soft like this is oh it feels so good
and it's so comfortable I slept in it
last night and then I also picked up
this top and it's just a basic black top
with some buttons both of these things I
bought for some reason with the idea of
I'm gonna wear this on a plane ride home
and then I also got these shorts which
I'm wearing right now and I think the
material and the just it's like a off
black kind of dark grey which is my
favorite and they sit highway
but they're so long enough and they're
also like a really soft really
breathable material so I loved that okay
and then we went to Target and I got two
pillows and a new flash card pretty
boring then I wanted to show you guys
I've been getting some like a few our
packages lately and my friend Megan
actually works for this brand so she
sent me this and it's the pistach a skin
care body butter and it smells so so
good
I've already used it and it literally
smells it smells like pistachios like
and then I also got a bunch of stuff
from Amica and I said that I would do
like a review on them so these are my
favorite products that I got first thing
is the nourishing mask and I use this in
the shower today and like you guys my
hair feels amazing and then I also was
really really surprised at how much I
loved their a dry shampoo and
conditioner so for lunch today I'm gonna
have some of the trio Joe's meatless
meatballs with some meal prepped lentil
pasta here is my lunch I wish you guys
could smell how good this smells right
now I finished from my video and now I'm
super hungry but I am craving food that
I don't own so I'm gonna go to Whole
Foods I want to get like some apples and
some vegetables and stuff for the week
and then I'm gonna come back here and
edit I also really need to clean my room
I'm not even gonna show you it because
it's not cute right now but I just got
these from Whole Foods and they're like
little vegan rice krispie treats and
they're so good I just picked up a bunch
of other random stuff like some apples
my pasta and I got some ramen noodles to
eat this week because someone on YouTube
made ramen noodles like a bunch of
vegetables ooty and it sounded amazing
so I picked them up I put this mirror in
my room with some lights around it and I
think it's kind of cute but usually we
keep this out in the living room so my
roommate now can't use it so I feel I
feel bad about that
um so I'm uploading my video right now
oh my god I just fell I just finished
editing it but the audio is messed up so
I don't have really time to like fix it
there's nothing I can do about it here's
my little outfit of the morning I have
on this top from brandy melville in
these shorts are also brandy melville I
had to get up and like put makeup on
this morning be
I have an online class presentation due
so I have to film myself like I
literally have to record myself for my
class and so I have to like a look kind
of professional I hate the neck on this
shirt though oh hey guys didn't see you
there okay well I guess the cameras down
a lot lower than I expected it to be so
right now I am just finishing up filming
my project for my profession
presentation class I just like film
myself giving a speech it is about 2:00
in the afternoon I woke up this morning
and I had a couple cups of coffee cuz
you know Monday I uploaded a new video
I'm so happy I did laundry last night
because now I have all my favorite gym
clothing but I'm literally I'm literally
waiting for it to get dark outside
before I go downstairs because I want it
to be a night workout and it's not like
night yet these are really good by the
way I caught this like three days ago
and I've already eaten so much of it
so this morning I woke up and like I did
it so much in the gym last night and I'm
so happy that I have like some little
baby abs this morning but I'm gonna go
to my annex
at my school right now and do my
statistics homework a lot of you guys
know Tuesdays are my statistics day I
literally spend the whole damn day doing
statistics how how sad and you saw how
to bagel for breakfast I never ate my
oats so I'm going to eat these that I
had milk cuts right now and then we're
gonna head out here is the official look
um yeah
you
I don't know why I have never thought to
use a ring light in my room at night
time to talk into my camera because I
always talk and it's like terrible
quality but this makes a lot more sense
and it's also really extra so I'm
literally so relieved I just got home
from submitting my course project for my
statistics class online I was literally
in the attics for five hours
I literally just sat down for five hours
straight and I hadn't eaten in five
hours I didn't even bring water with me
which was dumb I literally didn't even
get up to use the bathroom I just sat
there and I was like I'm not moving into
those project is done because this
project is consuming all of the stress
in my life I'm being so boring right now
you guys don't care about this but
anyways I'm gonna make some dinner and
then I'm going to work out in like an
hour again I really like night workouts
where you know because it just works out
the best like now that my day is done
with and everything's off my plate I can
just like have the night to like power
through this like work out for like as
long as I want to
so my class today isn't until 3:30 so
this money I'm gonna do one of my hair
masks and tone my hair while they do
that and this smells so good it's one of
their limited-edition holiday sons and
it's amazing and I'm just gonna watch
this is Kenzie's new youtube video while
I do everything hey guys so I just
finished getting ready for the day and
now I'm so freaking excited I've been
waiting for this for about a week now
and I'm literally like the biggest nerd
right now you guys know I've been
complaining about my mattress for like
as long as I'm tired about YouTube
channel and I finally just got a brand
new mattress this is Lola Thank You lo
for sending me this mattress and for
sponsoring this video I'm genuinely so
excited about this so if you didn't know
I'll fill you in but basically my old
mattress was really really uncomfortable
and it was my first time ever buying a
mattress and you don't realize it's one
of those things you don't realize how
hard it is until you actually go out
there and do it like I can't even pick
out a foundation without spending like
10 hours in Sephora so I don't know why
I thought master shopping will be easy
too but I remember when I first in my
apartment the pressure to get a mattress
and pick the right one was so real and I
remember when I had the first and I
slept on my new mattress I instantly
knew that I did not like it but I
couldn't go back I couldn't return it
the thing about lull is that they have a
hundred day return policy which is so
amazing like I'm so past me was a
dumbass for not knowing about this
company in the first place
future means a dumb ass too but at least
I'm a dumb ass oh it's gonna get
accredited sleep finally but having like
the right mattress to help you sleep is
unreal and mattresses are investment and
so you're gonna have them for years and
years which is why it was so stressful
when I was trying to find the perfect
mattress but well makes it so easy
because they literally just have you
pick a size and then the mattresses are
like crafted perfectly so that like
everyone basically loves them and I read
the online reviews from love and feel
like a bunch of other companies and like
everyone loves love and they're like
known for being like the perfect memory
foam like comfort level but this is what
it
part of my week like between all the
crazy of finals right now like this is
the best part of my weekend also lull
ships for free which like hello are you
kidding me that's insane I can't get
anything to ship for free these days no
bother
I'm Patras like are you kidding me check
them out if you need new matches in 2018
and you can use my discount code I'll
have everything written down below and
on the screen
again thank you lo so much for sending
me this mattress in sponsoring this
video I'm so appreciative and now let's
open this position begin enrolling
unwrapped setup okay this seems really
easy Lowe's memory foam evenly
distribute your weight and contours to
your body's curves my last mattress
could not handle these curves so Thank
You Love now I just have to wait for a
tow rise I'm gonna go what makes them
lunch and get started on my homework so
I think I'm gonna try this from lunch
this is new I just got it at Trader
Joe's this week
oh my god it was zoomed a kid this is
our little bit on the squad a little bit
on families our major inch so close-knit
and so we're basically like what we're
family basically
oh my god you guys I'm so tired I'm so
tired I don't want to get out of that I
don't want to get out of this bed right
now okay so I'm so tired right now but I
just got ready for the gym and I
probably take my makeup off after I
almost club but I'm so tired but the
thing that keeps it going is my pin
tweet on Twitter which basically just
says that like you get better on the
days where you feel like you don't want
to go so we're gonna go I'm gonna get
better
okay I'm about to eat an apple before
class it's like 3:00 in the afternoon
now I will go this morning and basically
edited this logs footage whoa and I
realized I'm editing this vlog how
boring it was that I'm just doing finals
like every single day and I'm just so
sorry this next week is gonna be so much
more interesting this sweatshirt that
I'm wearing is from Urban Outfitters at
my finale and I got matching starter
sweatshirts and I'm wearing it oversized

water eat this and
