channel so today I'm going to be filming
a bikini haul so along with all the
bathing suit so I'm going to show you
I'm going to make sure if you try them
all on
so you can actually see what they look
like and you can get a better feel for
them I also want to give a quick shout
out to Daryl they are sponsoring this
video so honestly thank you I've never
done sponsored video before so like this
is weird for me and also you get to take
them out your Southland apples and
zucchinis and so I said our curating the
perfect list of zucchinis to show you
guys and I absolutely promise to give
you guys my complete complete complete
honesty with these reviews I am going to
tell you what Fitbit doesn't like and
what I don't this way if the video can
actually be hopeful for you and I have a
lot of like tips and tricks for shopping
on their website that I'm going to like
give you as you go through and like I
just want to show you the key news so I
want you guys to actually find this
videos to be helpful
so give it a thumbs up if you do find it
to be helpful all right so let's just
get right into the band
all right so the first beginning I'm
going to show you guys is this one and
it is just a white top and it has these
high string bottom and one thing that I
really like about this bikini is that
these bottom spit really well because
you can tie them yourself so if you're
like me and you have like a bigger booty
and bigger hips tie bikini bottoms from
this website are kind of like a good
idea just might go towards because you
can adjust the actual sizing and I love
the detailing on the front of this
little knot that has cups on the inside
which I like because I can really small
boobs and so it makes them look like
some more rounded all right this next
bikini and another one of my favorites
and issues with a purple triangle top I
love the color on there I can get looked
really good on my tan skin zone it took
a really pretty plum and I liked it it
has you can address the strap I also
really like the way that these bottoms
we love
have kind of like an upgrade so they're
not high light but they're not maybe
low-rise they're that lid rod which is
perfect on the body types like mine
where I have like like a little bit less
of love handles these are very cheeky
and I'll probably wear these mostly
flights my pool or like the beaches in
California because we're a lot more
giving here for that but that Paloma we
are still modest on Cape Cod so I'm
definitely gonna show you some more like
modest bikinis through this next
Virginia I wasn't sure about but I'm
doing but with it and when I thought I
was like my mom is gonna love this
pattern because it's so like just very
girly very like Bray and like tropical
and I just think this would look so good
laying on the beach like I'm I think it
right now guys I'm going home in two
weeks and I get to lay on the beach and
I'm aware this shade because it's so
cute and then the bottoms are really
nice - they are cheeky they are very
small for like a size medium but I do
like them I don't know if I would wear
them back home I think I might wear this
top with a compare of white bottoms
because I also love the look of mixing
and matching like printed pieces and
solid ones so the next few are very very
similar and the key needs are a lot like
naked wardrobe bikinis but they're
literally less than half the price of
them and honestly probably the same
quality like this top is another one of
the scoop neck next top and if 100 the
low back is a little bit more slimming
and I just seriously if I need to be so
flattering and I've never owned a pair
of high-waisted bikini bottoms but I've
been seeing so many girls for this look
and I was like I really want to give it
a try today looks great in it and I used
to like to choke me to get books like a
tiger but now I'm like okay this is so
comfortable because it like it feels
like you're just being hugged it by your
bathing suit and again the next one like
I said is super similar the top
sometimes cops unlike the other ones in
and it's a little bit more thick like a
band
these are cheeky and I am okay with that
I think the seeds would be good to tan
in because you have like more sun
exposure so I thought this a good Lisa
top really cute and it's just um just
really pretty like bright blue and you
know I don't really do color so if I
bought does that means I really liked
the look of it bottoms are a little bit
small um they still work but I could
still wear them with a bikini but
because they have to ban it like let's
look in the queen of me right like a
little bit of like chub comes out of
this hole I'm so fine like body
positivity 100% but if I wear like this
top and like a pair of white bottoms and
be a little bit more confident
comfortable than I would so but the
thing is with these bikinis worth once
at half of it does it fit you still have
one good top for like 15 to 20 dollars
but that's what you pay at a regular
store anyways if you were to go to
Pakistan or like wherever it's going to
be like $20 per top $20 for a while so
next I wanted to order one like really
nice bright bikini because I like the
way that that looks with the tan so I
got this pink one and it's really cute
definitely outside my comfort zone
because I don't really wear bright
colors ever I can like hear my mom like
crying of happiness right now but this
is cute because it has a drop stuff can
be adjusted and it's just a basic clean
triangle tops
good quality I like it you can't adjust
the size of the waistband but it falls
perfectly on me so it's not a problem
so these bottoms are a little bit too
tight for me uh I don't know how I would
wear these bottoms so this bikini top is
really nice it has some knots on the
side of it and then one in the middle
which I like I think will be cute in
pictures with like jewelry on at the
beach and I like the material it's like
a little bit rougher and it has padding
in it and then the bottom are a literal
song like your blue is well hello again
this is a good one for the panning in
but not so much like like an evening out
with your family and but I feel like
love this look so I really like this one
and this next one is by far one of my
favorite so I'm definitely getting at
the most use out of so it kind of just
seamless look - here's the bottom and I
like the size dances like ties so you
can you can adjust this yeah you can
totally untie and I just that which is
great they have the most but coverage
out of any of the bikinis that I got I
think so that's really funny but the top
is really cute like a halter and it's
again these like little slinky things
and then it looks like that really
comfortable like it feels like you're
like wearing like silk almost so I
definitely love this one and it designs
media message please alright if I got
one one piece because I've never owned
one and I was like I want to try one um
and I got this one um it is high legged
and I'm not really sure like where the
highlighted part is like it I also like
that this has cuffs in it and it's just
really stretchy alright so the last
thing I'm going to show you is the only
one that I'm having issues with and it's
this halter neck and I thought the
concept of it was so cute online and it
has these two under wires enough kind of
a problem it is a cute concept but
executor is not so well because these
underwater pieces stick into you and
kind of skirt are you guys thank you so
much for watching I really hope that you
liked seeing all of the scenes I'm going
to be sporting on my Instagram snapchat
Twitter area somehow and just all over
the place discover comment down below

will see you later
