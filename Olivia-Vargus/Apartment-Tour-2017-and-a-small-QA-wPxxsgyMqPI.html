channel so today I'm going to be doing a
full apartment for you guys and if you
haven't seen my room tour before you can
check it out on my channel right now
I'll have it linked below so I'm going
to briefly go over my room anyways
because I moved it around since I last
film debt so if anyone is interested in
that you'll do to see like colouring the
range set I'm not going to make this
interest along we're just going to get
ready for the veil and at the end of
this video I'm going to be answering a
bunch of my frequently asked questions
that I get so you're interested spacing
for that and yeah let's get into the
video all right so when you walk into my
apartment
oh we have this like fake wood floor
right here and then the first thing you
see is the living room and then the
kitchen so we'll just go through
everything like one by one this is like
our cabinet space that Kiana and I share
so on this side is all of my stuff and
that is all her stuff but we share the
countertop space like we share that
stuff and we share that stuff so we're
going to look at my side if anyone's
interested this is where I keep my
utensils like some oven mitts like
anything I need really this is like all
of my pots and pans miscellaneous I got
all of my place and stuff from Ikea and
all my utensils new stuff from Ikea I
think they make the best stuff for like
the best prices honestly you can look
online with Wayfair too then I have we
have like a microwave my BAE I use that
every day and now we have so my mom
consistently sends us new dish towels so
they're so random but like I love them
because like my mom sent em to us for
like I don't know why but she just loves
to yeah then we have a Keurig coffee
machine that I bought off of someone
else and the not toaster oven was like
10 dollars and here is this like island
thing that I do a lot of my cooking over
there and if I think that's a blender
bottle I was supposed to clean it away
but I'm going to use there in a minute
so I haven't so under here we have like
this like our plastic wrap trash bags
you know cleaning supplies and we keep
our trash can over here
yes gross it's really gross oh we have a
Brita filter these are great for college
because you like clean your water and
it's like kind of expensive to like get
the filter retailers but other than that
like it's cool I like it
and then how I got my lettuce like
that so
you might be wondering like where is
like art dry food storage well we didn't
have enough room so we kind of makeshift
this over here and I basically bought
this metal rack from Ikea for like $15
and we just like so it's like I have the
top two shelves she has the bottom two
shelves and I have like my suitcase in
here we have this vacuuming fast humor
thing whatever from Walmart it was like
$40 and it almost is like a really good
vacuum I just literally went on Walmart
and like sorted low to high like
cleaning supplies so definitely
recommend and here we put like just
board up amid great things for each
other on and we have a tool and hooks
for our keys that way they're always at
the front door command hooks are great
definitely get a million of them because
it doesn't damage your walls and you
can't with grow holes in your walls in
apartments speaking of walls before I
really get into the living room I just
want to say that my one complaint about
this apartment is that the walls are
like a yellow like off-white and I wish
their white and I asked my leasing
department how much it would cost to
paint the walls and they literally said
it would take my entire security deposit
which if you don't know that's literally
like $3,000 or whatever so it's like
really ridiculous so this is the wall
color I have to lose it it literally
creates the worst reflection onto like
my skintone honestly I sound so stupid
for saying that but like it matters to
me and it's an issue
so whatever working with it anyways here
is our living room area before we go in
there we have these three chairs that I
bought from a friends down here is rug
then we have two couches so we have a
couch that I bought from a friend and
now my best advice is just like buy some
other people like she sold us his
couches the perfectly good condition
from Ikea but she sold it to us for like
a sixth of the price so it really didn't
cost much and I got all those cushions
on it and then also that couch over
there is like a leather futon and that
is from a friend also and we thought it
for like 40 dollars and they didn't like
Gianna I split up what we bought look I
bought the couch we actually split the
prices out because it was so cheap but
like I bought the couch so technically
it's owned by me she bought the TV so
technically it's owned by her that way
if you if we ever move out and we don't
live with each other it's not like
difficult to be like okay well this is
mine yours otherwise like thing
to catch it we split the price with like
one of us has to decide who gets it so
does that make sense like I bought that
stuff she bought like another set of
stuff so that couch is from Ikea but we
bought it from a friend look online and
like I said just ask around for you know
anyone selling stuff people are always
posting on Facebook pages like that
they're selling stuff and then that's
the table we have four of those because
they're like ten dollars from Ikea so we
literally have like four of them there's
one over there and there's two in my
room so yeah that is actually definitely
talk from Target I believe and those
toes I got with that couch and all of
her pillows I think we're from Target
carry chills are super expensive
I suggest like just going to Ikea or
like throw pose don't really matter like
I literally wouldn't have bought those
if I hadn't been given them so here's
just like a close-up this is like where
I sit and do a lot of work it's like
right here with my laptops and water
like my couch yeah it's like pretty
basic and then this is our printer the
printer is HP John about that if you're
interested in like printer stuff our TV
is a smart TV because we didn't want to
pay for cable
so basically Smart TVs only get like
Netflix and Hulu so we don't repay like
$30 a month for cable so I like it a lot
and then it was oh it was from Target
and I think they're like a hundred
dollars and then just I don't like this
TV stand we saw the candles on it but
that was also given to us by the same
friend IKEA was that so the TV stand was
like I think it was free we just like
swapped something with them but I'm
pretty sure they got it from Target when
they bought it so then over here we have
our tapestry that to stay home I love
this I stand behind this message so hard
course my favorite thing I have oh I got
it from Urban Outfitters for like 40
dollars and then that is the table that
I got from a friend and it came with
those like dining room like chairs and I
just do like my homework over there like
a lot of like work it's so random but
like our living room is so big like tell
me where else would it fit honestly like
in like a good way with a one chair you
know what I mean
so yeah and then this is like the
hallway so when you walk through here
you see my room on the right and then
Kiana's room is dot door right there and
then our bathroom is right there so I'm
going to start with my room and just
show you guys like how I have it
decorated I basically I did a room tour
like I said like
while ago but I moved it around since
doing it so I just put like my bed in
the middle of the wall and then I moved
that desk that was over there to over
there and I put like flowers on top of
it and basically it's the same others
and not like I have a rock salt lamp
like everything in here from Ikea and
Target
yeah and then I have like disappear you
can whatever throw to see all this this
is my glam like section where I do all
my makeup and hair this is my closet
behind here all these mirrors and yes so
let's move into the bathroom area here
we got these mats and then like a shower
curtain from Ikea and then like that
thing in there Keanu bought other than
that like everything in here came as it
is we have cabinets typically they split
down the middle as well so this is my
side I like my two freshmen is like
ripping regular bathroom stuff and
hearing nothing special at all don't
really to buy stuff at the bathroom but
yeah that's what I bought it looks like
and then Tiana's room lastly I'm not
going to go in because I don't want to
invade her privacy but just imagine my
room with one minute with one window and
into closets what she has so yeah that
is it I guess okay guys I hope you liked
my harness more it's not like super
fancy or like bougie but it's really
simple you know my college living so I'm
going to enter now some of the questions
that I have for you guys yeah lift it up
alright so the number one question that
again it's like where do I live and I
have my final Department so I live in
Los Angeles and downtown and I'm not
going to say with what building but you
can easily just look up online like
apartments in Los Angeles and I click on
like realtor.com for rent calm
there's a million websites that like are
like made at two five Harmon and it's
like fun to just shop or apartment and
like you can sort by your price range
and like whatever else you need to do
and we just going to look around and I
think the best time to buy is definitely
right before the summer when students
are usually typically moving out to go
home
so those rice prices go down it's so
weird but I swear like spring in summer
is too cheap this time to get an
apartment so as far as the most
expensive
Blagh so proof it so the next question
is basically a comment is it cost I
would say for your own bedroom if you're
in Los Angeles you're not going to get
less than $1,000 a month like you to be
realistic here
so I recommend definitely finding a
roommate I don't think it's really like
reasonable to like live on your own or
like in a one-bedroom like or leaving
studio at the studio still expensive
definitely look for like a roommate and
like someone you trust and get this a
two-bedroom we only would not lend you
saw and like we're fine that you don't
need something super bougie there's like
a bunch of little cause if you there's
this thing called a security deposit
they need to pay for like your renders
insurance your water bill your
electricity bill
I suggest like going on like wiki how
like Wikipedia and it's just looking up
like you know how much it cost at an
apartment and like get the information
from there so I'm not going to sit here
and like tell you like the press seat
with all the boring facts won't do
dissipate for but there is a lot more
that goes into it rather than just like
the month-to-month front so keep that in
mind although I think that you should
save about a thousand dollars for like
furnishing the apartment like
realistically like to get everything
like you're doing the plays you're going
to be chairs like if you want to tower
to living with room you're going to need
a mattress like $200 a bed so really
save up eyes a thousand dollars at
minimum and they just go online click
wait bear and like IKEA
and that's me refined like the cheapest
stuff and like it stays off basically
yeah you can do it for cheap but yeah
basically like the advice that most
people will give you is to like start
small and then like as you live like
kind of let's build on your stuff like
we didn't have like this couch for a
couple months but we can have that teeny
for a while like something kind of just
like you know happen as you go so don't
feel pressured to like decorate your
entire apartment right away like I don't
wanna happen slowly like if you're on a
budget like this is geared towards
budget oh because I'm on a budget so I'm
gonna probe with budgeting so the next
question that I always get is like how
to find a roommate I found my roommate
through the fit in student housing when
I started at school we were put together
and we just in do that like because it's
gonna be the dealer for six months so if
you don't have the benefit
like having a student housing or like
you know like room mate kind of
situation to start with just look online
like ask around look at people that you
trust I can't look I want to move out in
April do you know anybody that wants to
roommate like just ask around and people
like people are generally pretty helpful
so I feel a lot of like posting like on
Facebook and stuff like oh we need to
remain and the most important thing when
you're looking for a roommate is it like
being their best friend it's like are
they clean it can you like physically
live with them if you're going to see
them everyday like are they like just
like I like their living habits like you
don't have to be best friends with them
just like their living habits can you
get along with so that's what's
important so that is the end of this
video like always give it a thumbs up if
you liked it and subscribe for more
