channel my name is Liz if you're new
year and today I'm going to be doing
another X school haul and I say another
because I've done literally two other
ones already I think I know that it is
also a nearing the end of August some of
you might already be in school most of
you are probably just starting it soon I
apologize this video is a little bit
late on the bandwagon but I did just get
a lot of new stuff and I was like I need
to show this kind of video I'm also
going to be going into my junior year in
college and so all the things that I got
are more college appropriate they can be
worn in high school
depending on your dress code and I'm
sure you can modify a lot of them add a
jacket and add a sweater and allow them
to still be one of the weekends and on
your days off but for the most part I do
want to disclaimer that I just do
believe that a lot of these are more
appropriate for a college setting so I
was a little bit selfish when I was
ordering this clothing because I wasn't
really thinking about my younger viewers
and how they can't really wear this
stuff I was more thinking about like oh
like that's looks cute I want that I do
want to give a speech at you were both
fashion Allah and joins because all the
kalina's video is from them it was
really generous of them to send Kovac I
also want to give things to you guys
watching my channel because without you
I wouldn't be in a position that I am to
receive clothing from other companies so
I live in Los Angeles I go to a fashion
school there's literally no dress code
so a lot of this is just kind of what I
wear fashion OVA is located in downtown
Los Angeles
I've ordered from them before and I
really like their stuff their genes are
really good and joins is kind of like a
sample company and I work with up
zapable for and I really loved what they
said sweet and actually really shocked
by the quality of what I got from them
they're going to take about two weeks to
ship to me know which is fine but that's
kind of a long amount of time and
they're coming from China sappal usually
gives you the option to sort by priority
when you're shopping online you get
their items quicker and you know what
they haven't stopped you lens doesn't do
that for you so I think that you know is
going to be watching we should include
that into your website because I think
that is a lot easier for people who
don't want to wait for two weeks for
clothing but
further ado I'm just going to show you
all the posing at once with all the
sizes pricing and where it's from that
way you get the most out of this video
so you can hear me talking into the ends
and I really hope that you enjoy this
video and here we go
I
Oh
I just let assist in today's video I
really hope you guys liked so I got
comment down below it is everything was
make she's like why you fallen on social
media and I was exaggerating with all my
videos thank you so much for watching
and I was doing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
