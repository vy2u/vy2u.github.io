my channel my name is live and today I'm
going to be doing a second school flash
and this summer try on haul since I live
in Southern California I have a
combination of summer warmer clothing
and more school appropriate more like
dress code appropriate clothing before I
get into this hall and show you what I
got I do want to thank napple for
seventy this clothing I know a lot of
youtubers work with examples so I tried
really hard to pick out something that I
haven't really seen other people like
get yet you have like some new content
and I also want to give you my one
hundred line complete honest opinion and
review as always and you stay tuned to
the end Apple and I are going to be
doing a giveaway which falls on our
screen because items hit 20,000
subscribers and I wanted to do a
giveaway anyways so thank you thoughtful
so we're going to be doing a giveaway
stay tuned to the end to find out more
about that so now let's get started and
all of my styling and information that
can help you out is going to be in the
description below that way it can help
you out because I hate when people do
try on holes and they don't least a what
sizes they go I'm like you realize that
was the purpose quick tip before I get
into things when you're shopping on
jaska calm always sort by a priority
because I love the things that they show
are in stock but if you click the
priority box at the top of the screen
you'll be able to like get everything
sooners when you order it so that's my
best tip that I can give you for showing
on bevel so as always you're going to
see you haul in a lot of like black tops
because that's all that I wear so the
first one I'm going to show you I
already have on my Instagram because I
have no patience and I can wait to so
this is this top it says good girls club
on it and I love the material because
it's so I don't know it's really soft
and it's not the kind of hero that
wrinkles it's kind of a crop top but
it's kind of long enough that you can
still tuck it in and you stuff like that
with it and I love that as a crewneck
and I love that
believe but they aren't like super
committed sleeves they're like ha please
is that a thing I just think that it's
so comfortable and they easy aware and
are almost leggings and speakers and
whatever definitely go through me
this next item I also have already put
on my Instagram go follow me if you
aren't already but this is my camel
hoodie that I got it crossed and it has
a hood and I really really love this I
love the style and it's the fit of this
I just love crops hoodies there's
literally my go to like my actual style
is really lazy and like being like this
but you can kind of just throw on and
they already look good with like very
minimal effort are like everything to me
really lightweight so I can actually
wear this week here next I want to show
you mm sure I'm going to show you this
one first and this was I thought it was
black online but I think it's more of a
dark dark denim and I really like to cut
of them because they come down out that
they hover your booty because that is
issue that I always have this short and
the other period I got are the same ones
but they are in white and a half of
Fringe they have a little bit more
fringe
I'd like to print on this one better the
little more fringe I've worn of these so
so much they are both high waisted and I
love that and I don't know they're just
great shorts like the quality of them
very shop like I think these are better
than forever 21 shorts because they
actually like they feel better I don't
know since I just showed you the shorts
I want to show you this belt next
because I have been wearing this belt
every day I want so many compliments on
it like I said my style is so casual
about adding a belt and something like
this can really just make it look a
little bit more put together without
trying so I just love this next thing is
the measure a because then it shows you
that belt I want to show you these two
sunglasses this first pair is my
favorite they're golden brown lenses and
they have a bar at the top I just think
that they're so cute and they're just so
like so you're so dainty and they
consciously add to an outfit I don't
really own many goals on us and so I
wanted to pick up a pair and I also got
this pair there's nothing cause I got is
this one and it's a little bit more of a
style piece like I wouldn't really
for like actual live protection like
everyday use but I thought this will be
so cute like photo shoots and just like
cute pics like it's just kind of some
vintage like but the next thing what I'm
going to show you you guys are going to
literally scream because I don't wear a
lot of color and if you know me you know
this if my mom is watching this right
now
I guarantee she's going to like scream
she's gonna be so happy and I bought
this because of her cousin my mom's
going to be so polished you'll love this
it's a yellow dress you guys like what
I don't wear color I thought it would be
super like cute and my big did you
looking at violin compared it with these
square sunglasses that I just showed you
and then maybe I wore like some cool
sneakers with them and like a jean
jacket or something I'm not thought
before the summer ends the guy - was
trying to get like some cute like I
don't summery dress pics or something
like that so I don't know I think it
just couldn't really be a little up they
had it in a lot of colors but your girl
picked a yellow so round of applause for
me this next hop is another piece that
was like so out of my comfort zone but I
was like Liz do it
so it's this pop right here and it's
checkered print which I've seen
everywhere right now checkered print I
don't know why but it's like a thing and
get the cross off and one thing that's
really funny about this is that it has a
brand email goes have on it like I'm not
kidding isn't that really funny like
brandy melville expose like I think it's
really nice you can adjust the straps on
this because it just makes it easier but
when you're shopping online because you
know relate better tensions about
fitting if you can adjust it I think
it's also really cool if you took two
straps and then just make it like a tube
top I think because that's really in
right now this next top is another block
cross off because hello is me and I
already wore this in a video and I got
so many people ask me about it so it's
this top right here it also has
adjustable straps which is so so so
convenient love that it's been silky
really soft material and it's actually a
little bit stretchy too which is awesome
but it's so cute and comfortable and
just easy to wear I think this is so
like nighttime or even like dressing up
during a daytime it's a little bit more
classy since it is a silky material but
it's so comfortable in Kenya I tell you
guys I think I definitely recommend this
to most it's one of my favorites so this
next top basically is just like kind of
grungy it has these scales and hands
that are making that hand what's the
signal thing that I always am making so
it's like this and I make it way too
often so I thought it was kind of like
funny for me to get this top and then I
should like take a picture going like
that
yeah it's really soft and I'm going to
t-shirts right now I'm just tucking to
make things with like that belt and some
cool sunglasses just so comfortable but
like it looks like it took time and
effort so the last top I'm going to show
you is this bodysuit that like everyone
has thoughts like on him so his body
suit is a good knock off of the argument
I won and like everybody owns this body
suit and it has adjustable straps again
love that and if they switch the black
body suit with a straight across top but
I just thought it was like cute it's
really simple definitely like a classic
piece you can do a lot with that's why I
bought it the next two things I'm going
to show you our sports bras so if anyone
out there is playing any false sports
these might be really cute for you I got
them because I love to like dress up
when I go hiking normally when I'm
working out like I don't really care
about what I'm wearing but I go hiking
on the weekends and I like to come look
cute in case you know any like LA boys
making a Justin Bieber I would run into
you on Runyon like I need to live with
us I'm so joking like I don't mean to be
that a noxious right now this one's with
you it's mesh in the back which is
really breathable and comfortable it has
cuff padding in it which is also really
nice because I don't know which is kind
of is the next one also has padding in
it and it looks like this it all doesn't
differ in the front which actually works
you can zip it open a little bit if you
wanted to but it has padding mm so that
already it which is also really nice it
just looks more structured when you have
it on I love wearing sports bras with
high waisted legging
when I go like typing or what I'm like
exercising so I really like those deal
and last item I'm going to show you I
want to use it for so long it's just
pair of black high waisted jeans with
the lace of the sides and these are so
hard to find like they were such a style
for like spring /summer
and I thought that I was completing this
on because they were always so expensive
everywhere you look but then I found
this day on example and they were
honestly like I'm doing 20 something
dollars they were the most innocent pair
that I found so that is everything that
I got and wanted to show you I really
hope that you enjoyed this video
