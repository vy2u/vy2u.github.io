clothing haul for you today everything
that I have is from the shopping half
the dope they're not sponsoring this
video but I love working with dope don't
was kind enough to hook us up with some
really cute these summer and spring
stuff so I have a few bathing suits I'm
gonna try on for you
I'm on my period right now and I just
ate like a whole dark pickle so like
we'll see all this try on go this is for
me
so we've made it really easy for you to
shop all of this all you have to do is
text I need to reread what it is that
you have to so this is so cool but all
you have to do is text slim led to this
number on the screen right there so was
I knew the link to everything that you
can shop through this hall and then when
you're done with that I'm gonna text you
a random fact about me that like most
people don't know I'm pretty sure that
like the majority of my following
doesn't know the fact about me it's like
a stupid fact like I wanna die so let's
get into this all go from brandy
melville I picked up a ton of basics
because I feel like every summer you
just need like a bunch of brandy
melville basics this first white shirt
I've run a ton already and it's
literally just a white crop top with
this little cue ball but this is so big
to wear with like fun pants which are so
in right now I then got two of these
tops so the first one is in black and it
has like thick lining around the edges
and then the second one is in white so
I've seen it so many people wearing
these tops for like months now and I've
been debating like do I skip them
they're just like main t-shirts like
well they wear them enough but these are
honestly staples that you need in your
wardrobe so this next time I thought
would just be really really than comfy
and like easy to wear in the summer it
ties in the front and you can do various
different things with that these rock
tops are so in right now kind of girly
but I feel like if I wear these with
like my black Air Force Ones some black
denim shorts it's like I can make
look like that girly edgy feel that I
like most I also really wanted a new
short sleep crop top because I wear them
so often and I never think to buy more
so I wanted the navy blue one and this
one hasn't embraced rip and a white
strip so it's so cozy
easy to wear and looks a little bit more
put together it's really really soft
which I love it that's another
cooperating elbows or stuff it's just
soft you'll have a random elbow I'm
obsessed with it's this red denim jacket
I've been wearing this so much I've been
wearing it in my videos recently I just
put it on Instagram post it's such a
stable it's just so cute it's cropped
and it's frayed at the ends and I just
love it so much bread is so in right now
a friend is always in but bread right
now is just a good statement color so
the next door is gonna be princess Polly
which I'm obsessed with princess Polly
like their hands down my favorite
retailer so these are just some
high-waisted sweatpants and I know that
it's getting warmer outside so even in
why are you buying so hands but this
would like the white crop tops on Air
Force Ones is such a good go-to look
like I'm living in a month I'm like this
would be so futile I wear like when I'm
unpacking boxes and shit that song so
extra but others that goodbye answers
the next thing that I happened to just
call you it was this red bikini again
with the bold pop present color we are
really here so I saw this bikini a long
time ago and they sold out and then I
kept my eye on it and I saw dope like
right away when they had it back in
stock and added the card I'm getting
that I just really really love like the
material that this is made out of it's
really suitable and six then I also got
this top it says Polly that says
Wrangler on it and I just thought I
would get so much wear out of its just
two classes and just like casual day
today where I'm really obsessed with
like t-shirts obviously and then this is
just some good neutral colors like below
princess Polly fucks it up with their
accessories I really really love their
accessories so I got these earrings that
I thought were just kind of like basic
hoops but a little bit more fancy like a
little bit more unique and then I saw
this belt which isn't really meant to be
worn with pants but it's meant to be
worn like on the waist belt and then
like tied and styled all fun I own a lot
about I love belts so much princess
quality it's such a good place to buy
balance rhyme and then of course I
ordered from Topshop onso because I am
obsessed at Topshop denim its feet only
denim that I'm wear like I will not wear
denim from anywhere else but pop shops
pop shops bond jeans and their moms
shorts are everything to me so I don't
own a pair of black ones
I own a pair of black wrist ones
Saturday size 12 but from 2 years ago
when I first moved to LA and now I'm a
size 4 so what needed new shorts and
then I also just want to show you two
things that I didn't get on soap but
they were given to me as PR gifts and I
just really like them and I didn't know
what else I could show them to you today
from the brand Monday swimwear I'll show
you them on but here them in the
packages so I got this really really
amazing like pink coral color bikini set
the color of this is unbelievable if you
cannot get something like this at like
forever 21 or example like Zappos
quaking and then they also had this
amazing dark purple color with my hair
being like a light blonde now I've never
had length on hearing this and I realize
but it's gonna be a combo what you
everything was that I showed today and
if you have a nice tan and it's me let
your girl know also comment below your
dope usernames and I will try and look
up as many of you as I can and follow
you all back love you guys so much we'll
be having an amazing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
