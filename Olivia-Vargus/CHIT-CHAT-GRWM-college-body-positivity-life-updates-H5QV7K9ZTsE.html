today I'm gonna show you how to do my
makeup but instead of actually showing
my makeup I'm going to list everything
that I'm using down below and I'm just
gonna talk about the video I'm doing a
chit chat version because every time
that I want to film a get ready with me
I'm in such a delusional State goofer to
sit back grab a snack and hang out with
me for a little bit while we discuss
length talk about college a little bit
talk about body positivity a little bit
and the future of my youtube channel a
little bit life in general let's get
right into things I know it's just like
kind of go overboard like I want Emma
Chamberlain to release her own merch
that's just chapstick flavored it's
coffee because that's just my
Chamberlain in a nutshell I need to put
eyebrows on this is so scary to look at
but unfortunately that's not one of our
steps
4:01 now the other day I filmed a
eyebrows tutorial and it wasn't in the
camera frame at all during any of it so
we really learned a lot about ourselves
that day though we learned that you know
I just can't trust myself ever oh I have
to get up and let my Beauty Blender why
is my skin tone the same color as my
wall
we need more saturation up in this bitch
honestly nothing else is really new with
me lately I'm still stressed out and on
the verge of failing on my classes
just kidding you guys my classes are
fine I think we don't know this is
literally the worst part of putting on
makeup in my opinion I think I'm gonna
start switching up how I run my channel
because I make videos where I talk about
like what I eat a day and recently I've
been watching other people's what I eat
in a day videos and I feel like there's
this common theme going on where people
really like to put their input and
opinion on what you're eating you today
and they try and say like you're eating
to moderate eating too little or
whatever they want to say about it like
they just project themselves onto the
video which isn't the point of what I'm
eating it's like I don't make what I'm
eating it is so that you guys can be
oh my god like I want her body like I'm
gonna eat whatever she's eating cuz I I
get that I get that mentality like I
would do that if someone like Alexis run
and was like this is what I'm eating a
damn thang bitch I mean whatever you're
eating I'm eating because you look
amazing but the whole point of what I'm
eating is is to give you ideas on
recipes and just new ideas especially
being a college student like it's so
hard to figure out what to feed yourself
if you buy your own food and make it
yourself so that's like why I want to
make those videos but I just feel like
the industry has become too much about
like your body so I've just been
noticing a trend where a few people that
I've been following for a while have
been uploading videos and they're like
listen like don't compare your diet to
my diet because like I'm not completely
different like genetic organism then you
like yeah we're all human but what I eat
shouldn't be what you eat and you
shouldn't follow exactly what I'm saying
like make your own interpretation of it
and don't project yourself onto the
video like we all know clickbait like
getting people to actually put on the
video of me like interested in it is
kind of why it's turned into that so
next week or this week whenever this
video is going up I have a friend coming
in from Cape Cod to visit me and I
haven't had anyone from Cape Cod besides
my parents come to visit me so I'm so
excited but it is such poor timing
because we plan this trip in the summer
last year we didn't realize that it was
gonna be during my finals so now I'm
like really stressed out so I'm trying
to like refill my videos and get my life
in order and get everything situated
before the craziness and chaos the
finals happen but I am really excited to
show someone around at my city and show
them like my life out here as far as my
Spring Break plans I don't have any
right now because I'm just so busy all
the time and I kind of wanted to stay in
LA for Spring Break this year and just
get work done which is so lame like I'm
in college like I should be out in the
world traveling exploring but I am i
working gal I've got an
hired to build you guys I mean if I do
travel during spring break it's
definitely gonna be like a last-minute
travel thing it's gonna be like book
blossom and I kind of just want to like
stay here and like film videos and like
just kind of catch up with you guys cuz
filling two videos a week is good at all
but I just feel like I want to do more I
want to like talk to you more put up
videos like the day that I film them I
think for a while putting a lot of
pressure on myself to film like really
intense videos to film like really well
edited and really well like put together
videos and then I sure do realize it
like that's just not me like iPhone
videos because I like talking to a
camera I love editing videos and I love
the creative aspect of it but for the
most part I mainly do YouTube because I
just love to ramble like now like I just
love to ramble and I could talk for days
I'm known in person as like the most
talkative person you'll ever meet I'm
like so excited for the merch that I
created and I loved it but I'm such a
perfectionist that every time I make any
time I do anything in life I make 20,000
edits to it and I did that to my merch
and I still like want to make more edits
to it I did not bring an eyeshadow brush
out here I've been loving this eyeshadow
look from NYX right now I mix these two
colors and it's the bomb.com I never
thought that this would be where my life
ended up like I was never an eyeshadow
girl when I was younger I was never
really even like much of a
you know I should have definitely put
mascara on starting my eyeshadow every
time I feel we make a video like I can't
take it seriously and I'm just
illusional remember the best secret to
putting on your mascara is to close your
eyes and apply mascara just like this
and it makes it so long I've become so
much more of a glam person recently like
I don't know it's LA it's just getting
to me I guess because I'm assuming
people that knew me in like fifth grade
told me that I'm still the exact same
person I used to be I definitely am
guilty of how they go more than one
Gemini personality and you might not
even believe in Saudi oxides and doesn't
matter because whether or not you
believe in it it's just true for me I
have so many different personalities I
don't know why I've been watching a lot
of planet Earth lately and on Netflix so
you just released like a series where
there's like five episodes of it and I
really recommend you watch it before bed
like at nighttime it's so calming I've
been thinking about everything lately in
a really barbaric sense like everything
that I do I think about like what would
barbaric me do which is so weird and
everything that I see happen around me
I'm just relating to like a barbaric
version of the world that we are living
in today and it's me because I've been
reading through my classes so much about
just psychology and in the human
existence and what I really learned is
that while like yes it's helpful to
relate things back to like are barbaric
selves and like our own human instincts
in order to find like the sources of
like why we do things it's also
important to remember that humans are
the only animal on earth that's given a
consciousness and is self-aware and one
of my favorite things to think about is
how like a dog is born a dog and there's
gonna be a dog a whole life it's gonna
always have the same instincts as a dog
it's gonna do everything that a dog does
like it has all the same habits as every
other dog like yes they have their own
personalities but it's still completely
run by the instinct of itself being a
dog but the difference of humans is that
we not only exist
president but we have the ability to
recall events from the past and use it
to create new discoveries towards the
future and live a better existence in
the future so yeah once you start to
watch planet Earth and you watch all of
these like wild animals attack each
other and hunt each other to eat each
other it's just so weird because I'm
also vegan and I'm like if I was about
animal die I wouldn't be able to be
vegan because I would have to eat
another animal to stay alive but like
how do you do that like they don't have
a consciousness like all animals are
Psychopaths they don't have
consciousness I probably decided so bait
thief I am deep okay but not out loud in
my head damn that was fake deep of me to
say to do we appreciate him perfectly
blending my shadow crease my finger
right now I'm a skilled bitch James
Charles is shaking actually no James
Charles is doing just fine a lot of you
guys asked me what my lipstick that I
wear and I always wear this wet and wild
nude lipstick in the shade no deed with
Judy that's a really annoying name I've
shown this before on my channel but if
you're new then this is what I always
put my lips and it's the best because
it's so close to my skin tone it's like
the perfect nude color I also get asked
a lot how I stay determined to be so
healthy and work out and stuff all the
time and it's because it's a commitment
for me I think it's definitely hard when
you don't have something motivating you
like yes you can motivate yourself but
you need like an end goal to look
forward to like for example when I don't
feel like going to the gym I always try
and remember why I started it in the
first place which is to just feel good
about myself and to have like a space
for therapy because in the craziness of
life there's so little that you've got
to depend on it's such an empowering
thing to do and it just promotes
independence and it gives me something
that I know I can depend on throughout
the day to like escape to is to just go
to the gym and blast music and you don't
have to be like a spinning instructor
like you don't have to like listen to
like high intensity music and like be
hella energized the gentleman sometimes
I go to the gym I'm like really fatigued
the whole time I'm there I usually just
pick one album
choose that I think my vibe for the
night so the other night I listen to
Lorde and I had that go super emo night
at the gym and sometimes I'll listen to
the entire album by Jaden Smith post
Malone to the creator I just pick an
artist and I just listened to their
album full bottle I give my full workout
and not just makes it enjoyable for me
because being a girl sometimes I feel
kind of weak and kind of like puts heat
I wanted to change my fitness routine to
more weight lifting stuff because it
just feels like you're stronger you
definitely feel more in control of
yourself and like you can protect
yourself so that's why I really like
strength training I've definitely gained
weight since the last summer and I'm not
like sad about that I don't know if like
I'm supposed to be but I'm not I'm not
living my life to please others and to
work out to make others think that I'm
attractive or whatever I'm doing
everything for myself so if you see me
looking a little bloated or a little
pudgy then that's really none of my
business like you can have your own
opinion on me but as long as I'm just
doing what I want to feel good like I
just ate a real nice burrito tomorrow
and might have some mac and cheese pizza
and the next day I might eat like really
clean and eat like 20 servings and
veggies for the day if I feel like it I
don't know why I whatever do that but
I'm just doing what I want with my life
that makes me happy in a moment every
moment that I'm in with all that being
said I love you and I hope that you
thrive today and every day that you live
your life because you deserve to I hope
you know that your own worth doesn't
depend on what other people see in you
and it's just dependent on yourself and
that anything that you go do is always
an opportunity to strengthen your spirit
to learn something I think about
everything that I've been through in
life like times where I felt really down
about my body size or kinds when I felt
really high on life so everything that I
go through is just an opportunity to
grow and open my mind to the new
experiences and learn more so that I can
connect with and empathize with more
people and I think that's
amazing anyways I love you guys so much
and I will see you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
