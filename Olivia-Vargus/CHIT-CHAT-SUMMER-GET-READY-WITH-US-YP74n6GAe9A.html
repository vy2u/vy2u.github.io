channel so I'm here by our best friends
aliens and we are going to be getting
ready and doing the glowy talking
everything with you with us during us
yeah we're going to have an exciting day
we're going to like the most rainbows
and shop around Los Angeles so an ally
is visiting me from San Francisco sort
lanzi here so we had took a video
together so yeah we're gonna are putting
her makeup on for you guys start with my
face makeup I already put this on it's
against you coconut moisturizer and I
did two layers because we want extra
hydration when I put the stuff on it's
like really funny babies I just drew
that difficult to put my primer on
I hate blending my foundation it takes
so long I wish I did just like some day
like why can't more just invent like a
face mask foundation we just like peel
it on and then I peel it off tattoo
foundation if you ever see me without
blended makeup just don't say anything
my life is hard enough I don't need that
kind of like criticism I'm doing the
best I can
well at all I'm like oh my face jiggles
momentum on my blunt like my cheeks
tickle that was my basic security
growing up when I was like writing gym
or like students sports in general use
at least my cheeks with jiggle and the
guy never said that the Angels I didn't
want him to like like focus on it and be
like oh you're right they do but it was
literally always going through my mind
if we cheeks or jiggle it open our okay
quick boil gross but quick story 10 um
there's one more than eighth grade and
there was this girl and like actually
not I'm going to say what I was up to
saying but anyways she asked me if I had
so she's like Jewish surgery because she
kept staring at my boobs and I was like
no and then she's like are you sure you
didn't have surgery and I was like yeah
and she's like well then did you have a
baby and like yeah dude I'm like I did
I'm 12 like no I didn't have a baby
it's a prime example along these better
like the sex ed classes and like
informative classes that like that young
age awkward just a relational ooh what
does your school have for sex ed classes
because every one school is different
what you mean like did you guys like
have like classes on it or like did you
have a big nothin no so um we had people
or we had like my teachers talked about
it about it with us and we got to like
put in anonymous questions and ask them
after yes and then number four no I
didn't have any but the number because
my parents already talked to me about it
okay but the number one question was
like it might like how long in my penis
supposed to be thought that that was the
funniest thing because it's like all
these guys are probably like oh my god
is my penis like too small you know I
mean but what if someone's other piece
is too mu long they're really funny but
to the guy did have it worked because
they just like no no no have a worst in
what category I was like puberty no no
you're right we are here yeah we yeah we
yes I mean we start randomly leaving and
I have to question if we're alive or
dead for us for sex ed there was two
classes of it in health and I missed one
of them for a future for another class
so I missed the day where they talked
about like girls and then the other day
that has a void but the data they had to
avoid I just remember there being like
um we all got down in the teacher both
are you know everyone say penis like I
never was like penis and then we had to
do it three times until the entire class
of date without laughing and I was like
why am I here it was we don't say it and
laugh I mean just a funny word not
coming of its context big dick isn't
that funny but doctor when you saved it
you're like angry still no clue if this
is blended but I just like don't care
enough this is just coming like a sex
video okay with sex all committee I'm
not before I know
your muscular like what are they going
to do next you know I'm so excited to do
today it's not a comedian yo eat that
soup I know I really want my style is it
okay we sound really boring
get inside so then fought um organic
tample and show them right on nobody go
good you know oh yeah look at all the
babies aren't I got them at Target and
they're just like 100% cotton
you can't even there's like a glare I
think you can still get the gist of like
the packaging and find them yourself you
look organic they are organic I'm just
doing my eyebrows with the Augusta's via
you know oh yeah
we will allow you to use the same color
lived in the why are my brows for the
family that's why they look like really
similar like colors when we're using the
same yep
if there was like more nigga product but
you have to trust realize like nothing
else what would it be what would you do
those are my eyebrows on mascara but I
don't know I would say eyebrows but you
know a lot of people answer that
question if they blush and in love with
the no you're going to choose one
thing you're going to put blush on I'd
even wear blush some like extra confused
when eyebrows done and the other one
it's Logan's my rosemary different
shades of fine every day I remember
focus on my eyebrows being like
symmetrical anymore I just want like
each of them to be preening in their own
way this would you have like this arch
and this one one that that arch there's
still two good I've out on their own
together they don't make sense but I
don't suppose I'm going to use this lush
it's called
buttered Brazil lip balm and it's and it
tastes so good
bitch Tony's your total health poppin
I like mind when makeup to look like a
bronze you look so as long as I look
like glowy I'm happy but I don't like to
put any color on my face I don't want to
do mascara I mean I do I don't like to
do I shadow I don't like to do blush I
just like to keep it like super soft and
like I said when I put that kind of
stuff on that's when I feel like not
myself anymore you don't put too much
meat up on and then you're like what
have I done and I have to like I can't
yeah that wasn't me answer you I'm like
I I just could be I force myself and
