I thought I would vlog a week in my life
in college I woke up this morning and
instead of checking my phone I do it my
normal morning routine I was like I'm
gonna I really like the way I feel when
I wake up before I kept my phone and I
feel really alert I don't know but don't
want to check my phone I feel tired
again I feel like the days become like
gotta check on everything got a twenty
mails got do all this stuff and so
instead I was like no no no it's Sunday
I'm gonna write in my journal which I
almost never do in the morning my
mantras for today in the mantra that I
wrote down was I'm accepting of all that
is my body my life my conditions and I
choose to work to see things positively
in a way that will better guide me to
better understanding I saw that working
my stuff
so today yeah I'm so excited because I'm
going into a brunch at my old work and
it's this Mexican place in downtown LA I
used to be a host there for a couple of
years when I first got to LA it was my
first job there they are not vegan but
while I worked there so it's morning
sometime everytime talking while I write
there I begged them to put vegan things
on the menu I would always order vegan
things I would keep tally of how many
times a vegan came in to the restaurant
and I would show the management and I'll
be like look you need more vegan options
that restaurant is like my family I
think they've already launched it but
they're just doing a giant vegan brunch
with like other content creators in the
area that are vegan and they're I'm just
so excited me my room a mess looking for
an outfit um so ignore everything in
this frame besides in my outfit this top
is from you know what this entire
outfits from Topshop so my top is from
Topshop
I just said that everything was
different talk talk why did I say that
like I said this morning this place is
like my family I love them so much oh
yeah and then over the summer I did work
for them again this past summer I did
freelance social media for that I'm just
so grateful like they welcomed me back
after a quit it wasn't even just an
internship like they physically gave me
the job title of social media manager
so I'm at border grill and this is my
old manager and what did you decide it's
all your doing but a bit of a good liar
no the new vegan menu you just added 99
percent by the way 1 percent - ok we'll
take it I like that flip these chips are
absolutely amazing I used to eat these
behind the host stand and I would eat
them during my shift for dinner because
like you don't really have much of a
lunch or dinner break so the menu looks
absolutely amazing there's so much to
try we're gonna have a feast today I
physically wore loose-fitting clothing
or like my most like forgiving clothing
because I was like I'm preparing myself
for those fun fact I used to literally
take pictures of their food for a living
so things just got very serious this is
like a little mushy
if there's ever point of my life right
neither I'm Italian suppose I get
working round now okay so now that I'm
home I think I'm gonna watch some
Netflix for just one episode of
Riverdale because I've been addicted it
was three o'clock so I'm hoping my four
I'll start my homework I might stay home
and do my homework or I might go to a
coffee shop to me continue it's about
five o'clock and I have not done
anything I'm really ready for summer
break right now I'm ready to not have
homework to do because it's already it's
like week three and I'm like I met um
Stella Raye and Sonia I was this morning
who are vegan youtubers that I've been
watching since 2015 which is a long time
and I literally love them so much so I
might because I used to work at vertigo
they asked me to send them over a list
of like vegan influencers in Los Angeles
that they could invite in so I sent them
them and I was so excited to meet so I'm
like I was a little bit and ever smells
like I've been watching us for so long
and like I wouldn't begin because of
them and border grill has a new vegan
menu kind of because of me as my manager
said so it kind of is like really funny
how it came full circle now I invited
them to the brunch at this place so
that's really awesome but they were
goddesses in person
so at Starbucks I got a chai tea latte
with almond milk but it's so sweet and
it's honestly kind of heavy so I think
there's like a lot of sugar and that's
honestly I don't think that it was like
my best choice ever because I eat so
much today but just wanted to show you
what I got my homework is so much worse
than I expected it to be and every
single one of the assignments scares me
so I don't know which one to start with
so I've just been bouncing back and
forth between each one starting one and
then avoiding it and ditching it and
starting a new one and then ditching
that one and it's not it's not it's like
8 a.m. and just woke up I haven't
checked my phone today yet because I'm
trying day 2 of waking up and not
reaching for my phone first thing and
instead like journaling and doing stuff
that's productive and then checking my
phone later I like to pick my coffee cup
based on my mood that I wake up and so I
found it to be so beneficial like so
good because typically I wake up and I
rush into the day right away after like
wasting maybe 30 minutes on my phone
just checking on things what's going on
online and it doesn't really help me in
any way and then I just rush into the
day with like just sort of an empty mind
said I'm what I went expecting so
instead like right now I just wrote down
so I have one class today at 3:30 and so
I'm actually gonna start my homework
like now like I just woke up and I'm
like I just wanna get this over with and
then I'll work out today and I've
and I don't come home and I'll finish my
homework and the rest of the week is
pretty easy
after today today I just have to get so
much homework done and then after today
it's like I just have to go to the
classes and then like I'm free that I
have like my youtube life
if you're a typical college student you
occasionally feel mildly depressed like
bro what I am a college student and this
is literally a textbook for one of my
classes like that's not cool the classes
on social psychology and the first
chapter that I really liked was about
attitudes if we want to change ourselves
in some important way it's best not to
wait for insight or inspiration
sometimes we need to act to begin
writing that paper to make those phone
calls to see that person even if we
don't feel like acting to strengthen our
convictions it helps to enact them in
this way faith and love are like if we
keep them through ourselves they shovel
if we enact and express them they grow
and that's so relevant to what I'm doing
right now instead of like having the
attitude that I don't want to start my
homework I just sat down I was like I'm
just gonna start doing it so sometimes
you need to act before you think before
I tell the story just know that we did
get through it so you don't need to feel
bad at all of anything just laugh I
would about to tell you but during the
moment that this is all happening it was
not fun so as you guys know this morning
I woke up and I was like it's still
positive it's such a good mood because I
decided that I wanted to be and I sat
out like literally like 7 or 8 a.m.
and started reading my psychology book
was we had a reaction paper due and I
thought that the reaction paper was due
on chapters 9 through 13 which is like
hundred pages and my friend texted me
and she was like dude it's all chapters
like four through nine not 9 through 13
I instantly have a mental breakdown I
was like I just wasted probably three
hours researching this paper so I go
back and I read those new chapters I
read an entity and note and do the same
thing to those four chapters and then
someone else texts me for my class
she said the reaction paper isn't even
on the book it's on an entirely
different thesis from 7:00 a.m. until 1
p.m. doing this and then I had to go
back and start from the scratch and
write a reaction paper on an entirely
different basis than any of that
information my head feels like it's
bleeding
yeah I'm entering this coffee you know
she was she texted me she's like I'm
reading back to me it's a class I
dropped right and like sprinted to
target very good did the service well
this morning my alarm talk did not wake
me up the socks in my shoes have fallen
down and this morning while I was
brushing my teeth I started thinking
about something funny and I started
choking like on my toothpaste and I
choked so much that I had such so
wallowing a bunch of my toothpaste so
that's all today is going anyways um
today's a very interesting day it's a
very eventful day but I don't have time
to explain right now I'm gonna go buy a
granola bar at the
in store because my school doesn't have
a cafeteria I don't know about you but
we enjoy our fine dining in other
aka granola bars it's a view from the
classroom he's like kind of cute
Jenelle and I wanted to get up and over
our downstairs I think you're just said
to that you guys what I want to know
about it right on and then the line was
so long so now I'm starving
who here is in the online class
literally took me four or five hours no
more than that Jimmy like six hours do
the homework for it though 24 MLA
sources okay so just a quick little
update because this might be confusing
now so I had class at 8 a.m. for math
and then I have a class at 12 today and
I have a class at 7 p.m. today I ended
up going home after math class and
showering and changing and instead of
one in my 12 p.m. class I emailed the
teacher and let her know that I had like
an opportunity to come up that I didn't
want to miss out on and I'm missing a
quiz and she never emailed me back so
I'm really hoping that I can get those
points so but I'm just going with the
flow of today and now if you guys know
I'm gonna elaborate later but I'm going
to meet with dope which if you guys
don't know what that is it's like the
most amazing and up-and-coming app and
it's like taking over the world right
now
and they're doing like a photo shoot in
Santa Monica today with a bunch of
people I have no clue who else is gonna
be there
also I'm not good at putting fake
eyelashes on but that does not solve you
from trying yeah alright we're gonna go
now
I wish it looked as pretty as option
my phone was literally like vlogs after
I'm a demo clearly a pro vlogger let you
go I resemble Olivia right now and we're
in a first outfit oh this is so cute
we love this orange she is like the
vintage II vibes and then I have like
more like a denim like kind of like what

thing if we're here with a chaise you

traffic right now I'm trying to get back
in time for my class at 7 p.m. first
week when I start when we start moving a
little bit but no so it's gonna take an
hour to get home I don't mind traffic to
be honest like I just pick music and
like honestly just relax like it's kind
of like me time alone

kind of stressing me out there's like a
lot of turning and then stopping and

to say today was a really great day it

hey guys so it's now like 12:30 on a
Wednesday I just got back from the gym
and I had it worked out since Friday you
probably noticed in this vlog I didn't
go to the gym once because every day
like I just got it was unexpected stuff
that I didn't plan on doing and so I
just didn't get I didn't get a good
workout in since last Friday so today I
went and I was so nervous that I wasn't
going to be able to like perform at the
same abilities that like I had been
performing at I was so scared that I was
gonna like have to use lesser weights
and stuff but I honestly still I still
got it
it usually takes about two weeks to lose
like your muscle and anything anything
else is just psychological today I have
my hair appointment so I'm gonna go
shower and then I'm gonna we're gonna go
get our hair done I'm so excited

through downtown just holding some
alfredo sauce and pasta to make when I

listening to Bazzi all morning his music

uplifting I also just be my second cup
of coffee for the day I also think I'm
gonna film out here today because I
really want to use the natural lighting
that this area gets my couch is so used
in like Warren I have to like try and
fix that I'm honestly just really sick
of filming with a ring light it just
feels so staged it doesn't feel natural
at all and why don't you still like
those videos that I've made with my ring
lights I want to at least try and film
out here with natural lighting today and
so I'm about to sit here and edit now
it's about 2:00 in the afternoon maybe
one o'clock yeah so I'm gonna edit for
another half an hour and then go work
out I will say I'm like a little on edge
about this video after editing it that
it's gonna be the right choice and smart
choice to upload I'm probably gonna cut
out a lot of the angry parts just to be
responsible but know that they existed
and that I'm just trying to save myself
so around 4 o'clock in my apartment so
lighting in this part of my room gets
really really good as in sunset so I
