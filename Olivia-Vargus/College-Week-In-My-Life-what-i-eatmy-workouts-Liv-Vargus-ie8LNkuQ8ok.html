new here my name is Liv I make new
videos every Monday Friday it's at the
time feel free to subscribe and join our
family so we are in the car right now
and this morning we woke up and we did a
pretty I would say a pretty good workout
typically as you guys know we go hiking
on Saturdays but the fires have made it
like impossible to breathe in California
so we're like we're not gonna put
ourselves through that so we went to a
gym I'm thinking about getting a gym
membership seem like a more serious one
I did not vlog yesterday cuz I didn't
want to vlog another day of myself
taking finals and doing homework and I
was like it'll be nice to kind of just
focus on that anyways but we're gonna go
and get food at like a pretty popular
place an island called toast and yeah
so I ordered a bunch of key sunglasses
and they're on backorder kind of like
they're late but I haven't one of these
ones in a while I'm so excited to get
the new ones that I ordered just like no
one said
cute little sign we just got our food I
got the kale salad with quinoa and then
this is a literal random side of olives
because I took the avocado and feta off
of it and then Keanu got eggs and
potatoes mm-hmm
literally randomly loves a random bowl
of olives olives
my name is Olivia Olivia real friends
offer you a piece of their bread I don't
think I'll ever find a guy that treats
me as good as Keanu de
this is la in the fall it's like 80
degrees out actually it's like probably
70 now it's cooled down because it's
like afternoon but it's really really
pretty out and I love the side streets I
think the house is here really cute this
is like a really cute house shout out to
if you own that house and jealous doing
a beautiful out loving life I'm enjoying
being in nature I can't wait to go home
in a week and be outside and like not in
a city and live in nature and be able to
like get my car and I Drive to the beach
look at this fake-ass grass what the
fuck is this so there's so much fake
grass and I like you dog shit because
it's legitimately for the purpose of
dogs so we just took some pics make sure
you follow the grams
you good bro because I don't think you
could bro when they tell you that the
fries are cooked in animal fat so you
can't eat them cuz they're not vegan
that's my reaction we said like we've
made a big deal about it when we were
leaving we're like we're not going to
the Grove I think it shouldn't be busy
right now I don't even really have
anything to get at the Grove I don't
really like shopping at the Grove
there's nothing good there anymore but I
think I really want crest fries cuz we
never had a Sables today so now I'm like
craving fruit I'm craving a fruit I just
made a left turn through four lanes of
traffic in LA and she goes pull out game
strong
she's not wrong like you did a great job
of pulling oh wow so we come to the
Grove literally every weekend so I feel
kind of bad it's like the same content
yeah it smells like smoke oh my god this
sunlight appears very very good right
now that golden hour glow the thing
about golden hour though is that the
filter that I use doesn't look good with
that thumbnail tape it up Sydney crawls
in 2017 we think the thing to do before
the Sun rose that

to the background beside there yeah
happy Lakoff pressed and i got their
chocolate flavor with some chocolate
chips coconut flakes and granola and
this looks really good it's really cute
I think I'm gonna drop it all over
myself I would be the idiot to do that
so they're really living the life right
now
keep this in mind what I'm doing finals
for us the week this is why I'm
Saturdays like we have to make our days
interesting the sky looks so cool right
there
Yoma this girl's gonna get hit because
she's played
I like the effort so it's actually at
least six o'clock which is super early
but I'm pretty proud of us
because we actually did not buy anything
at the Grove tonight which is a miracle
I did get pressed alright so we just got
home from the Grove and now what we're
eating these cookies that my mom sent us
so every year my mom makes Christmas
cookies for us and they're like a family
tradition I've been eating these since I
was born but she recently like two years
ago started making them vegan so it's
basically she just swapped out the
ingredients with Earth Balance butter
but they're amazing and so these ones
are peanut butter balls covered in
chocolate and they're so good there's a
grace crispy in here and then these ones
are like snowball cookies we're watching
the good luck charlie Christmas movie on
Netflix and it's so cute I remember
watching this like a couple years ago we
have our tree the candle and we've been
eating the cookies mostly I've been
eating cookies I just ate so money and
I'm sick now but so Keon and I are going
down memory lane of like old videos of
us and I first of all looked so
different like my glow up is
pre-exponential and trust me it's still
buffering okay but to say that but watch
this video
keyonna last night to take these cookies
to work and give to her the people she
works with and she left them here do you
know the willpower it's gonna take me
not to eat these for breakfast I'm shot
out Kylie cosmetics because I can't get
this off of my wrist you guys ever sleep
like really weird like it's not like
good or bad sleep but it's just like you
wake up and you're like what dimension
I'm I and I kind of just feel like that
right now so I'm just trying to like
figure out who I am it's fine we have
coffee you know we find this need this
thinking my bloodstream and I will start
my day hey guys so I just got them
finishing one video today and I was
gonna film a workout routine and I had
all the intention to do that like I was
so excited about it all week and then I
woke up today they're do they feel like
I got hit by a bus like I'm so sore cuz
we worked out really hard two days in a
row I like a new gym so I was you didn't
office equipment and we were in there
for like hours so my body is and now I'm
gonna blame but an edit and I need a
little Whole Foods with them all out of
almond milk so I'm gonna walk in there
in a minute so I want to say I'm that I
saw something on like Twitter Tumblr the
other day and it basically said how you
describe your life right now it's hype
is what you're manifesting and hearing
that actually really scared me because I
was like well if you asked me how to
describe my life right now I would say
I'm tired I'm anxious I'm stressed and
overworked I'm homesick and that's
really scary because it's not what I'm
trying to manifest so hearing that was
like a wake-up call kind of that like
I'm clearly not attracting the right
things into my life the way that I think
that I am so I wanted to share that in
case you needed to hear that too
I think it's ok if you're not in a good
place and you want to manifest being a
better place I think that the way that
you should describe your life is by
saying I'm getting better at having
better free time I'm getting better at
managing my stress I think I've hit a
wall everyone hits a wall once in a
while I probably hit a wall every week
but you know so I think we should go
walk to Whole Foods right now because I
don't feel like
just yet I'm so tired
holy guacamole
I literally just looked over and like my
breath literally was just taking away I
need to run upstairs to the roof right
now
this guy is literally on fire hi-yah oh
I'll live vicariously through your
relationship the world is cool sometime
why do I have such bad acne right now
like I don't know when and where this
came from like I didn't even notice it
appearing but like that is so bad stay
please I don't feel like holding a
camera and I was gonna go to the gym
that I have the like temporary pass at
but I was like do I really want to walk
there the thing about that Jam is that
it's like really intimidating it's like
a really big gym and there's a billion
people that go there I just don't feel
like doing that today and it's kind of a
fart it's not awesome I just don't
so instead I'm just gonna go to my gym
downstairs and I'm gonna do my arm day
and then I have my statistics final
today's will be my day
okay so it is around 11:45 so I was at
the gym doing arms for like an hour and
a half I guess and I did some cardio and
I came upstairs and I got this package
from cret key it's caught this
definitely pronounced key no I was gonna
say okay and I'm not gonna show my face
on camera now because I look so bad but
I'm so excited about these sunglasses so
I definitely want to show you what I
thought so these are the first ones that
I got it just definitely Kris Jenner
vibes and then these are really similar
but they are like a different I think a
different vibe you know what I mean so
those are pretty much just like basic
silver sunglasses but yeah so I'm now
eating my classic lunch of my lentil
pasta with alfredo sauce and I'm gonna
watch some YouTube videos and then I
have to upload a video in about 30
minutes all right hey looking good live
just upload of my new video this video
is so funny to me if you watched it then
you know that it's just so delusional
I literally just sound crazy throughout
the whole thing but you guys are so
amazing I love you all so much
I love reading your comments and
responding to them and if I don't get to
respond to your comment like I'm usually
always the person that gets to like
thumbs it up you're depressing attitude
on finals is me this one girl I feel you
also you guys what the heck we just get
150,000 subscribers that was my winter
goal like I'm so so so I'm so happy I'm
so grateful I'm just so shocked how much
like this community has grown with so
much love and just so much I love you
guys so much I can't wait to hit more
milestones with you I got this at
Ralph's last night and it is I know it
says melk like right on it but it's
vegan plant-based milk and it has 10
grams of protein in it so I'm gonna use
this and I'm going to use a little
packet of the humm raw Beauty and I'm
going to mix it all together and make a
little little protein shake for myself
it's supposed to be good for your skin
too so I'm hoping that it will help with
my happy that I random
got overnight love that tada this looks
so good and it's mint chocolate which it
tastes really really good and I'm also
currently making a potato so that's
gonna be my snack for the day yes we
love an eco-friendly bitch who uses
metal Bundy straws instead of plastic
ones heck yeah sweet potato and homework
that is my Monday okay so the practice
exam is 22 pages for my stats class and
it's cumulative what the hell my parents
had listened to me when I was younger
and told them that I wanted to be a
Disney Channel star so that I wasn't
sitting here right now I'm trying to do
my homework for it well my final four
statistics because think of all the
better things I could be doing with my
life right now
also I'm literally already stumped on
the first question so this is going
really really well alright so now it's
about 7 o'clock and I just made dinner
it's literally just a sweet potato some
broccoli and then it's more like a
different flavor curry sauce on top
water and I finished my practice exam
and I haven't graded it yet so hope that
that is good because it took me like
four hours this is the pale
sleep-deprived but happy face of a girl
who just passed her stats class it's
like nine forty one and I've been
working on this all day as you know
literally did the practice exam all
morning and your girl just got a 95 on
the final exam which was 77 cumulative
questions and it was like the hardest
exam of my life like I literally spent
two hours doing it it gives you three
hours to do
College morning routine is a literally
wake up and watch vlogmas videos that I
missed I drink a liter of water and a
cup of coffee here and then I'm gonna go
work out um these glasses are so extra
but that's okay because that's kind of
what I'm going for
I'm gonna go to the gym that I got the
temporary membership at and I'm gonna
see how I feel about it by myself hey
guys so I actually didn't film that much
this day so I just wanted to show you
like me working out for a minute I did
work out the other gym but then I didn't
feel like I got enough of what I wanted
in so I came home and did like another
30 minutes of like my favorite workout
after my workout I had this vegan
protein shake and it was really really
good and then for lunch I had another
bowl of lentil pasta which is my
favorite this is a new brand that I was
trying out and it's really really good
to see my fredo sauce that I always use
but this brand has beets and Sue's
healers and carrots mixed in with the
regular of mental pasta and it's high in
protein which I love I also had another
cup of coffee to get through my homework
I know a little cliche but it really did
its job it got me through it and then
for dinner I had the most basic simple
bowl of peas at white rice and curry
sauce really really simple really easy
to make but honestly really filling and
pretty satisfying so that was all the
ate but I just wanted to say that to
fill in the gaps okay so I literally
spent the whole day doing this project
that I have to present tomorrow I'm
gonna pass out right now like I'm so
tired I mean a little bit early pass out
happy Wednesday so today I have my
presentation for one of my classes and
I'm gonna go to the annex in a minute
after I eat a potato which I'm cooking
right now and I'm gonna go work on it a
little bit more than like perfected and
then I have that presentation at 3:30
and then that crosses over with and then
went over the gym later but right now I
just woke up and I got ready and I'm
just trying to wake up and just like I
don't know it's been a weird week but a
weird day now potato is ready I honestly
don't know what I'm wearing right now I
made a mess of my room trying to figure
it out and then I was
I'm just gonna put on my go-to sweater
jeans and these are my new key
sunglasses that I love and now we're
gonna go work for three or four hours
and then give a presentation for three
or four hours and I love life I'm gonna
work out after all that so today's gonna
be a really long day okay bye I wonder
what the outside world is like I've been
trapped inside oh he was gonna like this
look if you didn't know that I go to an
art school my mom jeans will tell you on
their own I want to ask labels so bad
right now but I told myself once I
finished my final project before class
I'll go get one but I'm really having an
internal struggle right now because I
want one so bad like right now that I'm
like what if I just go get one and come
home and eat it but then like I'm
risking time mucks I need to get my
project done I've literally just found a
vlog click wait two seconds go saying
like I don't know if I want to go get a
stable now or after I finished my work
and then Kiana came home and she was
like oh I was gonna go right now it's
like okay deal I'll go with you oh my
god is gonna ask if you want one too
thank you
so nice somebody let me hear those that
I stopped to finish my final project
that's due at 3:00 and it's like a
Photoshop assignment and so you never
know how long those are gonna take like
usually like I need time with like
marketing assignment and you can they
crank out if you need to Photoshop you
to take your time but I'm confident I'm
not confident at all and once I master
but I'm gonna talk quietly in keeping in
here is us you know that guy in our
apartment building that has the big dog
have you ever looked at his face is he
attractive you so much cuz he's so tall
that it's funny to news dog yeah this is
that book no anyways so this guy I run
into him all the time like and I mean
like actually physically run into the
man like I wouldn't say him actually I'm
really really
yeah exactly it's not really my fault
it kind of is I'm kind of a klutz but I
know he's ran into him legit when a
choice drive yesterday
and I don't know if his face is
attractive it that's my dilemma because
it's hard to make eye contact with the
tall person without it being obvious my
type in men it's the work from 2000 in
like 10 - 2013 I was convinced I was
gonna marry Justin Bieber from like 2013
to 2014 I was convinced I was gonna
marry Cameron dalas and right now I'm
just in love with dogs and peanut butter
and my love life so is her dog driving
no but tbh the sudden have you right as
I said that not arriving this is the
epitome of happiness for me okay they
hooked it up with the granola
there is granola for days I always get
kind of sad after I finish eating
because I get sad that my food ends
especially with acai bowls because
you're eating them it just feels like
you know I just want it to last forever
just this like depressing love story
just like my entire life long depressing
love story I'm just the only one in it
though breaking my own heart I just
finished my project so my project was to
make an app for like a brand that you
loved so I used Jim shark cuz you guys
know how much I love them and I used Sam
James because she's like my absolute
favorite don't ask me why right now I'm
not even hungry and I made these are all
my noodles to eat before class and then
I put ice cubes in it because it was too
hot and I kind of had this like moment
where I was like wow this is really what
my life has come to this is this is rock
bottom this is really sad my finals are
officially over I well here's the thing
it doesn't feel real yet because I don't
have my grades back yet and so until my
grades are back and I know that I passed
on my glasses and everything's good huh
to resubmit anything so it's it doesn't
feel over just yet but it's technically
over like no more work to do which is
amazing this quarter was like a lot I
can't wait for this next week you guys
this next vlog is gonna be so like worth
it like these last two vlogs I'm sorry
it was like mainly just me being like
tired doing homework and then like some
depressed tumor here and there so it was
definitely like a weird side of my life
that I don't really love putting on film
because it's like not the most positive
uplifting stuff ever but you know it's
real life and my life and memories so
thank you for watching this week's vlog
man sorry I look so crusty right now I'm
gonna buy some milk from Whole Foods
edit this vlog go to bed and I will see
you technically tomorrow but you won't
see me until next Friday so don't forget
