company alright hey guys what is up
welcome back to my channel or my bed
again we are today
I just woke up like honestly probably 10
minutes ago
don't freak on myself I put on some BB
cream and I was like we're just gonna
kind of like go for a natural look here
have an honest little chit chat because
I would get all ready just Telecom this
talk right now I was going so big so I
just want to have like an honest chit
chat casual talk right now so really
below any comments that you have about
anything about to talk about and I'll be
going through it at the end of the video
or like clear today reasonably and
responding to all of it so I can be like
helpful to you guys so basically I get a
lot a lot a lot a lot a lot a lot don't
sell this on your way compare live I'm
saying it okay fine I'll just watch it
life goes on try to be aesthetically
cute with the common cup in my hands and
it didn't work out what's my life moving
on so I get a lot like I was saying
before we were so rudely interrupted by
my coffee I get a lot of questions ask
me about Los Angeles and because I've
made so many videos about slogans I just
made a lot of like what it's like to
live in other videos and a lot of room
tours apartment or a lot of college
videos so I think a lot of people follow
me for that reason and so don't fall for
that reason you don't watch this video
but if you're interested in extra living
in Los Angeles or just like myself in
general I just want to talk to you guys
about how the truth of what life is like
for me right now I'm here so yeah just
get into it I made a list on my laptop
last night was my fear I was listening
to write a playlist on south loud I was
like I'm going to talk about us in the
video and a middle is so refill us at
one by one everything that I wanted to
touch on so a first through our touch on
is that whatever it's got here it was
what I was coming to college and so I
was really excited to make a lot of
friends kind of you know kind of meet a
new friend group base be like a normal
college stuff I just wanted to meet a
bunch of thing people yeah I'm coming
from across the country I don't know
anybody else here and what I quickly
gathered and learned is that everyone
that comes here comes here for
themselves into where themselves people
that come here are coming in for career
divisions networking services college
purposes even if they already lived here
they kind of still seem to have insight
about them that everyone that comes to
your kind that lives here basically is
really self not absorbed but only
interested in themselves basically and
that's not necessarily a bad thing
because I did that too I came here for
college for myself
I came here to grow a life and a career
for myself so a lot that comes with that
it's networking and this not but I know
McCoy Kendrick Lamar song like everyone
needs to be more humble everyone's kind
of like all about the networking and who
you know when like I don't know it's
just kind of it gets in your skin when
you come from a place like I did where
everyone's like really humble and local
and know each other's families and
Google where each other's houses for
dinner and here it's like oh I think I
can fit you in for like a coffee date
after it's like next month on a Thursday
and it's like okay it's just wait son
I'm moving on to the next thing that
word better than I just worded that one
so when I moved here like I said I just
wanted to meet new friends and kind of
develop lifelong relationships and I
realized shortly after that Los Angeles
is more like the survival of the fittest
not everyone who meet here will save
their lives
probably two out of every
people you meet are going to stay in Los
Angeles for more than a year even or
just like for a bottle lifestyle but
just for a long long time
so I've had a lot of really close
friends from Los Angeles leave Los
Angeles and I don't know if you guys
know that but it's been kind of a weird
college experience and I'm not the only
one I know I know I'm not trying to get
paid yeah that's what you're saying in
Los Angeles a lot of the people that you
meet don't end up stain your blog and
they end up going back home for the most
part or going somewhere else because I
think it's really survival to business
out here it's expensive to live here and
also it's a lot of pressure live here a
lot of just high-stress to live here so
I think that it gets to a lot of people
and not everyone can deal with it I have
so many breaking points and I don't even
know how I'm still standing but I'm here
to prove to myself that I can do it so
but yeah it's just kind of difficult
when friend after friend meant you keep
getting close to keeps moving back home
and long-distance friendships aren't
like a problem with social media and
technology these days
thank God I have a lot of longitude
friendships that I consider sterile to
be less of my closest friends even one
of them are coming down this week like
they're flying in this Wednesday just to
measure today so it's possible to have
slopes longest and friendships but it's
not something that you prefer as opposed
to an in-person friendship but I'm
Robinson plain I'm so grateful for the
ones in my life is that I get to share
love with so show them Cheers another
like exposed truth about being in Los
Angeles is that there's a lot of
pressure when you live here to be really
successful right the second you get off
the plane here if you're not somebody
then you need to be freaking out and
like be felt insecure because
everyone here seems to be somebody and
that so don't appreciate a say at this
point because I feel like everyone that
lives here already knows that and I
don't have to explain this but everyone
that lives here is like 17 years old and
driving a Range Rover and is building an
empire and not that you should ever
compare yourself to others I applied
myself in the fact that I know I'm on my
own top and I know I'm going to make it
where I want to be someday I'm not going
to let distress them consider myself
others wing me down there are moments in
life where you forget that and there's
moments where you kind of can't help but
be like oh my god why haven't I achieved
like what I wanted yet and you just kind
of adhesion with yourself that's not
wasn't a video but in Los Angeles it is
so annoying because it's just in your
face everywhere you go so anemia is just
kind of the thing that hurts me about
this place is that nobody can seem to
just sort of chill and maybe like except
where they are everyone's always around
you it's always just bitching about life
and bitching about like why I have they
may be asked we're all guilty of that
boy um just more than Los Angeles um
also another thing you thought I'm just
like not a person who's super into
fashion and a lot of the singing in Los
Angeles is fashion based and it's not
something that meshes well with me so it
kind of throws me off living here
because I didn't rehearse and not just
love development a white t-shirt and
jeans we go to Target where everyone
else in Los Angeles
seems target as a place to show off
their new Gucci handbag or whatever on
earth they want to and it's um annoying
to me I don't care but yeah that's the
thing I wanted to say everyone's like
super into style and I'm over
like this is the champions t-shirt that
I got off the pot for $10 I'm a facing
of big big big big big thing about Los
Angeles not really I wish could change
but is impossible is that it's insanely
overpopulated I'm from a town where if I
wanted to go to the beach and just cry
or like sit there for a while i 100%
could and nobody would encounter me at
all and comes Los Angeles and there's no
such thing as being aloneness ever ever
so wipe that from your expectations
because you will never be alone I have
to move into my old apartment to feel
like I could pass in a long time and I'm
still just unbelievably like confined by
humans and everyone is everywhere I was
literally right in downtown and all
night all I hear is people on the
streets and cars going by and when I got
the visit money I got in Arizona couple
months ago it was the most amazing thing
ever because it was the first time
within the span of six months where I
felt like peaceful and in nature and
just could walk outside and like stretch
my arms and no one was around to be like
oh hey bitch it's just me like a lone
pet is so valuable to me I'm an
extrovert introvert I love being alone
but I also love talking to people so I
know where I fall on that scale but if
you're anything like me that's what it's
like to live in Los Angeles
okay so I guess I lost through the lips
of everything that I wanted to touch on
I do want it like say before anyone
comments anything really mean because
people like Susan on YouTube for some
reason I'm crazy grateful to be here and
the reason that I'm here is for school
first of all I guess the meter that I
want at this school and you can't get it
really anywhere else and also I'm here
because this is where terms of female
life I do feel like I have a lot in
common with the people that live here I
think this is where I'm supposed to be
now my life I know for a long time where
I'm going to be I haven't thought that
far I have but I haven't set in stone
anything enough where I'm going to
manifest you for anything because I
would not want to present sure but I do
love being here it's a really exciting
and fun place to live and with every
crazy this is going to be cons and pros
and nothing is perfect but I just want
to clear the air for all the people that
have been commenting on my videos and
gaming me about Los Angeles in my school
and all these questions and I just
wanted like give you the truth like yes
la is no place to live
there's hell of things to do however
just some kinds of people there's
definitely people that are genuine on
the mountains beginning this video that
you can find in me and you can go on to
it's just a lot of things that you know
you probably hear whispers of that I
just wanted to clear up this is what it
genuinely feels like on my mind body
soul to live here it can be a lot but
that's not the databases worth it to me
so be into this video if you want to see
more about our life in our life Cooper
before we answer their Instagram
snapchat I just a lot on though probably
more than I should
I'm sorry that's it thank you for
sitting with me while I pour coffee on
my white comforter cigars I have until
right now and not wearing any makeup
literally gust woke up a second ago to
sell this video it's 9:00 a.m. and it's
videos move up a few hours this is
already getting too long all right I'll
see you guys later bye
honestly you can't see it that I should
so clean my compass</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
