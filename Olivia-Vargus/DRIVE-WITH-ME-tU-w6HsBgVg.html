upside down because my camera is
attached to the window not the dashboard
like I thought so
hey you guys so weird sitting in my
parking garage right now and we're going
to go drive to the Grove I need to go to
Barnes &amp;amp; Noble and get a couple of books
that I have my eye on I'll show you them
when I get them if you guys care like
what I'm reading so yeah I'm going to
take you with me let's go driving in Los
Angeles I'm sure you guys know and like
have heard but it's the most terrifying
thing in the world
there's a million people here they all
are so so so bad at driving like I'm
really not kidding this is my favorite
song of all time right now someone next
to me so I'm talking the song so that I
can listen to like the good part when
I'm like good and ready
it's like damn
I wanted that man oh my god
it's me really bad eye contact with the
guy sitting next to me now I remember
why I don't go anywhere or do anything
it's because it takes so long
this outfit knowledge it goes over your
boo look I got the words so wrong
comment down below like what your
favorite songs alright now I want to go
check them out
everything that I'm playing here is my
favorite song so no secrets here I'm on
dedo de nananananana buddies Oh dad okay
I'm just saying if california tax feels
the need to be so high at least make the
roads better because I would really
never drive like a nice car here like
even thousand millionaire and you were
like hey here's a million dollars okay
I'm gonna go away now you don't even
really notice okay anyways if I was like
really rich and I bought a nice car I
wouldn't drive it here it would stay in
my driveway because I'm so afraid of the
road here like they literally will
destroy everyone's cars what is wrong
what's going on okay I think I think
it's okay to drive should I have like
invited a friend with me today I'm much
happier by myself
sit down no Liam hey there's clearly
someone is always dying in Los Angeles
can we're the most dramatic species very
things like social anxiety but like on
the road it's like over I don't think
even love me a lot we're going to go
around the building it's going to take
me a lot extra time but I'm not bitch
wasn't letting me over so I think is
less no I need to get over the heat Los
Angeles y'all the most selfish beings
that I've been watched a bunch of the
Harry Styles videos from you turn right
here
 me we're good we're good
 with oh forget working I've been
watched a bunch of the Harry Styles
videos on James Corden YouTube show
channel what am I saying this morning
and oh my damn he looks so fine
so Harry if you around let me know I'm
vegan single yeah you can go I don't
know we don't care I mean fine I'll go
that's okay yeah we'll just at each
other
short bitch the book I don't know what
the you wanted me to do in a
situation bitch how does she look good
in sweat like if I were wear that
outfit people would literally be giving
me money thinking I'm a homeless person
welcome to the Grove I feel welcome okay
guys I'm going to go park my all my face
to thread that's cool okay guys I'm
going to go park my car get these books
and I will be right back um so I went
into Barnes and Noble and the book
section stressed me out I wanted to find
a book on like cells how like personal
girls like girl balls kind of stuff and
there was way too many books and I was
like brah I need a book to find a book
here to like figure out which one I
should use so I gave up and awkwardly
left the girl without buying a single
thing I almost got from you guys and you
should be proud because I didn't because
I remembered I passed a snack yeah bitch
always thinking ahead so that was the
clothes thing I've done in my
we're going to go home now I guess I'm
still happy I drove all the way out here
this actually happens to me a lot so I'm
not surprised you guys I'm so
embarrassed right now I thought that
with my friend do you guys ever do that
like he looks exactly like my friend and
he wasn't but I like awkwardly like you
saw I was going to be like hey and then
it wasn't him and I backed my car up and
everything like I look like a damn idiot

flashing that it's dying so I hope you
