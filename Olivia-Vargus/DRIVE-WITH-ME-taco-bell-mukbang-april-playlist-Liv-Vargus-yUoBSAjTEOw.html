we're gonna do a little whooping hey
guys what's up welcome back to my
channel my name is live if you're new
here feel free to subscribe and join our
family today I'm feeling particularly
delusional I'm always delusional but I'm
extra delusional tonight because I don't
know why it's a Saturday and I am in the
mood for freaking Taco Bell so bad right
now
I'm also vegan and you can get vegan
Taco Bell Crunchwrap Supremes and I'm
gonna make that happen
without further ado let's go um oh my
god I have news I feel like it's really
big news and I feel like I should tape
it up I don't want to make a whole video
just dedicated to it because it's not a
topic of news but to me it's really
exciting oh my god you guys okay how do
I like just go out and say this because
it's just so big for me I am moving in
one month we found a new apartment and
I'm so in love with it I live in
downtown LA and I just hate the city
that guys watching
so downtown LA is just really crowded
and dirty and I just I'm not a city
person I'm Way more of a nature person
and fresh air kind of person so I'm
moving out to Hollywood finally so
excited obviously Hollywood still isn't
like nature but in terms of Los Angeles
and in terms of me still needing to be
able to get to school for the next year
I need to be like in Hollywood so I
can't move out of LA for a while so I'm
actually moving in with someone brand
new I'm not gonna tell you what it's
just yet but trying to leave a gas in
the
stumble low okay so over here is one of
my favorite songs right now everyone can
see right now that I don't care
coming coming
I don't
I look so rusty today I can't get my
hair to like cooperate there what a
short drive honestly I don't even eat
fast food often at all but I'm starting
my period soon as in it's supposed to be
here today it's not yeah but you know
you know it's gonna be here today and
it's gonna be here today so I don't know
I have no grip on my life right now hi
can I get the Crunchwrap supreme please
but can I get instead of beef the black
beans and then can I get no cheese I
don't all know nacho cheese in no sour
cream you tip not talk about like how
does this stuff work I really don't go
to drive-throughs ever if you have a tip
jar you can keep the change
I'll lead it back thank you thank you
have a good day does anyone else wonder
how they make food so fast at fast food
places like I get it it's fast food for
a reason but like I still don't know how
okay where can I park that there will be
shade that's gotta be it that's gotta be
the spot we're gonna back looks so dumb
you gotta do what you gotta do of the V
no this might not have been the move
myself I'm gonna look even dumber
someone's turning in here okay we're
finally I'm okay I'm fine I'm just gonna
go there's people over there buck we're
gonna stick to this original spot okay
oh my god you guys see why I don't leave
my apartment or go out in public alone
I'm just like a big awkward idiot
I've been dreaming about this all day
okay I'm so excited right now
this is like a paperweight it's really
hot too
I said how do they make this so fast
like I ordered it in like BAM there it
was I don't get it I don't get it
most people do everywhere no like rich
USC students coming here and like just a
vlogger in my car I don't even go here
okay we're gonna do a little mopping I
feel so grateful right now like you
should really follow your dreams
whatever they are like this morning I
really wanted this and I like made it
happen for myself and I'm just like
living the reality of my dreams right
now and I'm just I'm proud of myself you
gotta live your best life while you can
you know okay so now what not to be like
I need to go at more food but I need to
go grocery shopping I'm all out of a lot
of things so there's a grocery store
like two seconds away but it could go to
him but for the sake of this video being
longer like I'm dead-ass gonna go drive
to a different grocery store I think
Oh
okay so I'm not sure again why Lowe's
and gets so much backlash and hate I
know he's like 14 or 15 years old he
raps about like drugs and woman and
stuff but his music is so good and that
I just think is because he has really
good producers and I got really good
teams with making him sound good but
like I'm not gonna lie like his music is
really good really this this lighting is
so bad okay
there's like three really good songs by
him so I'll play them
this might be our song right now though
by Loes an yeah
yeah
a little more light she said she felt
all right
bust you if the man was looking at you
we'll just stay cold there's a statue
when my last steel be good for you would
you be there I'm gonna buy myself cookie
program ok leave my car without you're
coming with me
I don't feel like doing this alone right
now oh my god I'm so bloated from the
talk about like I'm wearing mom jeans
but it's still very privately an issue
did I just use a word correctly I don't
know
um I really don't even have words I'm
just gonna just gonna like this
speak for it so okay so this is 100%
like my period and craving doing this to
me everyone do you guys ever like try
and find the one that like has the most
chocolate chips because it like makes it
more than worth it you know what I mean
um so my camera died right as I was
taking him I use my cookie I was
literally like taking a bite and I look
and I just see my camera turn off and I
was like um but if you needed to know
the update on the cookie it was
obviously amazing and now I don't know
what to do the rest of that bag of them
because like obviously I want to eat the
entire bag but like I can't do that to
myself like you can literally see Mike
Winchell in the background this morning
like your girl's sugar count for the day
is so bad like this video if you want to
see a full post video because I
literally did not include even like a
fraction of how many good songs I have
of those right now and they're not like
popular songs with their songs that you
wouldn't know most of you I will link
down below my Spotify playlist any ways
that you can check them out if you want
to anyways I hope that you guys still
enjoyed this video and have fun watching
it I different him from making it I got
to eat a lot of food this was definitely
like a PMS version drive with me like I
was so irritable and so hangry the whole
time anyways love you guys so so much
hope you're enjoying your day wherever
you are and I will see you guys later
with an all-new video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
