name is Liv if you're new here and today
I film for you a really quick and really
natural makeup tutorial for school
mornings whether you've already started
school or you maybe you're starting
really soon I really hope that you enjoy
your school year and the start to your
school year education you guys is a
privilege and learning can be really fun
if you let it
obviously nobody really like loves high
school or middle school because of all
the drama and everything and just the
stress in general but I promise you
power through it and get good grades and
it will all be worth it and before I
can't do this makeup look and show you
what I did I do want to share something
with you guys that is really really
important to me so some of you might be
new here and if you aren't and you
already know that I am always always
always talking about buying organic
deodorant that is aluminum free I didn't
know until about two years ago that your
deodorant contained aluminum which is a
harmful chemical that is proven it has a
literal direct link to cancer in women
so I started to buy organic deodorant
and I tried a couple brands and I'm
actually really excited to show you guys
this brand today that I finally found
that is one of the best deodorant that
I've ever tried and it doesn't have any
aluminum in it so the deodorant that I'm
talking about is this one right here and
it's called native deodorant
native deodorant is actually sponsoring
this video so I want to give a huge
shout out to them because I will be
talking about this product no matter
what anyways and I was going to buy this
on my own anyways you can order it
online I'm not sure where they sell it
in stores and I have a 10% coupon code
for you guys the one that I love the
most is their coconut vanilla one I
swear on my life you guys you do not
sweat through this deodorant they also
have a lavender and rose our cotton
white peach rose and Magnolia coconut
and shea and an unscented one that they
send to me and just to sum it up again
it says that it is paraben free and
aluminum free so you are safe from
harmful chemicals my friend yeah alright
so now I'm going to show you what you're
here for my makeup routine so let's get
started oh wow why do I always look
baking in my videos I swear I want to
talk so the first thing I'm going to do
is use a micellar water this is like a
coconut one from yes to cuts and it's
super hydrating so I'm going to take off
any makeup that I might have left on my
skin and then I want to get rid of the
redness on my face I'm going to use a
rose water and this one's from lush
that should wake you up
I recently got the Trader Joe's
moisturizer and a lip balm from them and
I'm actually really impressed by them
and they're really inexpensive and not
tested on animals for dry normal skin
which is what I have and then I'm going
to use their lip balm I'm gonna take
like a lot of it with the back of my
fingernail and put it on I look so
stupid when I put the bomb on I hate
doing that on camera so this is add
ample of the bare minerals hydrating
primer and I got this when I bought
their foundation that was a triple
wondering at the primer and I actually
really liked it so I'll probably go back
and get the primer as you can see I'm
breaking out a lot right now because I
traveled for like a month straight and I
just was like eating a lot of oil and
like hey french fries like I was just
not in my skincare routine so we're
getting back on track but I'm gonna
cover those up with the NYX gotcha
Covered concealer and I'm gonna put it
like exactly where all of the pimples
are I think there's some over here
sometimes I just don't even care and I'm
like just put it everywhere I live just
conceal your entire damn base fun fact I
don't have any concealer right now for
my under eyes because I ran out I need
to brighten my under eyes not so much
conceal them so I'm just gonna leave
them bare for now I got this Real
Techniques sponge and it was only about
six dollars from Ulta and it's a lot
better than the Beauty Blender I think
which is about twenty dollars I just
bought this bareMinerals bear Pro
Foundation and it has a matte finish
which I usually don't buy matte finishes
but what I like about this is that it
stays on all day it's literally the like
most long-lasting foundation I've ever
owned I'm just going to put it directly
on the Beauty Blender oh you know what I
was gonna do that I forgot to do we're
gonna do it now anyways so I have this
CC cosmetics it cream and I have it in
medium tan because I was really cocky
over the summer and I was like I'm gonna
maintain this tan I'm gonna buy a
foundation for myself and I didn't and
so I was wearing this for too long and
it was like literally the wrong shade so
I'm gonna mix this together with the
foundation that I have and hopefully
like the two of them will combine and
make the perfect shade for me right now
okay so this is like the mix together so
that's the it cosmetics and this is
combination of the two oh yeah this is
so much better combining the two a good
solution so you know 4 by 2 foundations
is to just get the right shade in the
first place because purely I can never
do that so one of the things that I
really like about the bear mound ation
again is that it's like a good finish so
I don't even have to really set the
makeup it'll just stay on all day and I
don't even have to set it so now I'm
gonna put on my bronzer my favorite part
because now I get to turn my face from a
mood emoji into more like a human being
with cheekbones if I ever became big
enough on snapchat and got to choose an
emoji to like represent me I think it
would be the moon emoji because honestly
you guys is that not what I look like
like I have such a round face and now
we're gonna put it here because it makes
it look like you put my makeup on when
you really didn't rule in the world so
now I'm just gonna do my eyebrows with
the anastasia dipbrow promenade like
always I'm shooting them off camera real
quick leave a comment down below if you
want to see a full library routine but
it's so hard to do it in this view
finder so I'm just gonna do it in my
mirror ok I've also definitely been
testing me lately but they're done
they're a little thick but that's ok if
Rihanna can be thick so can my eyebrows
honestly mascara makes my eyes so like
red and itchy early in the morning that
I don't like putting it on sometimes
I'll bring it to school and always
putting it my bag and put it on at lunch
I'm gonna curl my lashes right now and
then I'm gonna put a really light coat
of mascara on curling my lashes gives me
the worst of the worst anxiety like what
do you do if you have to blink while
you're curling your lashes well I'm
looking at my eyebrows right now while
I'm doing this I probably shouldn't
bashfully look of a hand but you know
how they say like your eyebrows are
sisters not twins I think my eyebrows
are like cousins because they really
look nothing alike
so those are curled and now we're just
gonna put on the NYX mascara that I love
and I'm just gonna put on a little bit
of it
so the trick to getting natural-looking
mascara is to hold the wand at your base
and blink so that you get a heavier
amount at the bottom of the near your
lashes and then it kind of disperses
really like like um briskly what's a
word I don't know and then the top of
your lashes aren't as heavy so this is
what my ashen lashes look like so let me
show you see this is a funny angle and
then I'm just gonna take my Universal
brush that I told you about and this
eyeshadow palette palette from real hair
and I'm just gonna mix like these colors
and I'm gonna give myself a highlight
with them and you can take some and put
it on your lid too if you want
and see this is just like really quick
and easy to do makes you look like you
spent more time doing your makeup though
nobody will ever know I swear every time
I wake up in the morning girls find a
new place to put highlighter I feel like
one day we're just gonna take it too far
and someone's gonna be like highlighting
their ears or something and now I'm
gonna put on this finishing spray to
make sure that it stays all dive if you
want to I've actually been loving this
um lip paint from Tarte that I got in
their birthday collection and you can
just like dab a little bit on your lips
like I put it on my finger very good so
this is my official finished look this
makeup will lapse me honestly all day
which is so great I really hope you
enjoyed this video and you liked it you
can give it a thumbs up and make sure

almost at 800,000 and I will cry when we
get there so go slay and have a great
day and I will see you beautiful babies
