channel today's the day I've been
waiting for my entire career on YouTube
I get to just eat on camera um this is
like obviously a thing that's best thing
for a while it's trending right now but
mukbangs are like blowing up to the
somewhere and I'm so excited because
this is my calling in life I ordered it
from my favorite place okay so I ordered
from my Chloe it's a vegan plant-based
chain and they have one in Glendale and
I know they have a few other runs around
the countries and okay let me show you
what I got I love their food so much
it's almost so good so I got their
plastic burger and this is unbelievably
good I asked for extra sides of sauce
because I am like a big sauce person and
then I also got their mac and cheese
which is so good like this is crap
to me oh my god and they have these like
I don't know if you can get them without
it but if you guys don't like mushrooms
they put like bacon mushrooms on top but
I think if he couldn't I don't like
mushrooms but they're like crispy and
then I also got a smoothie I don't know
which one this is but I've already been
drinking it because I was like really
hungry setting up yep she's good she's
fresh she's flirty we love her
and for dessert as if I needed more
actually yeah like I can easily eat so
much from my Chloe I'm such a foodie I
wish you could see all the food in the
frame but like you can't get me and the
food in for at the same time eating on
camera is like low-key uncomfortable 14
days they can make it 14 more days so I
asked you guys on Instagram to just ask
me some questions that we can like talk
and chill and have a good time
Wow what do I start with oh my god they
were all out of french fries it's fine
you know we can't have everything we
want in life at all times you know it's
good I'm humbled it's it's nice I found
dumb as okay
this smoothies almost a really good
there's like almond butter in it don't
make fun of my eating styles please okay
I'm gonna show off the mac and cheese
because um yeah let's just I hope
that this looks as good as Italy I want
it - honey you did that you straight up
to a dot
there mac and cheese is so good
you can mac and cheese his ass if its
plant-based cheese it's so good and
theirs is like amazing it's like cashew
and like I don't know oh my god like
this is better than regular mac and
cheese to me it's so good it's so good
and you don't feel just disgusting after
you eat it like you feel nourished still
because it's like still happy it just
digests better feels better it just has
more nutrients than like the regular mac
and cheese whatever have so hashtag
blessed life is so good I should answer
questions but like just let me let me
just enjoy this reminisce okay
Oh tip them some questions what do you
study at college if you don't mind
saying so some of you might or you know
I study social media which is basically
just like online marketing and it's like
a brand new major not a lot of colleges
offer it this is how my college like
appealed to me I'm getting my bachelor's
I already have my associate's degree
like I physically own a degree already
Here I am still at school after college
I've been obsessed with YouTube my
entire life like after college I want to
continue to do make my own youtube
content and then like just be in that
world because I don't I don't even care
about Instagram or Twitter or any other
social media I don't care about social
media
I just love YouTube so much so I just
want to continue doing stuff with
YouTube of the youtubers my youtube
channel whatever the hell I can do that
keeps me in the world of youtubers I
want to do because it's like everything
to me I thought about getting an
internship for like something that has
to do with like you do influencers but I
didn't because I was like I don't want
to like be emailing my friends and like
being like Oh business see what's out
I'm like I'm friends with youtubers it's
like my world is YouTube like it's just
awkward it's like really weird oh this
is a really relevant question when did
why did you decide to go vegan I'm
actually vegan for two years now Cinco
DeMayo with my two year anniversary but
like I didn't say it'll mind any works I
just didn't I didn't know what to say
about it I decide to go vegan for the
ethical reasons I'm like such a softy I
can't even kill flies so when I figured
out because like you're so unaware of it
until someone I pointed out to you
there's why some beads are a little bit
aggressive because they know that like
once
no you know would never look back it's
the easiest well I don't want to say
it's easy cuz it's ignorant to people
who don't have the ability and privilege
that I do to like have vegan food like
this all the time and to shop for their
own food and not based around right
temptation my roommates vegan which is
crazy because when I first met her she
always would be like yeah veganism is
not for me I would never be vegan like I
just know that like it she was so strict
on her back I think it's just important
to always stay educated and keep an open
mind which youtubers inspire you the
most
I don't want who you might think that I
watch I'm like obsessed with like comedy
youtuber I don't know how to inspire
everybody but I'll tell you like who I'm
like in love with on YouTube right now
I'm really in love with the McDonald
sisters like Emma and Maggie because
they're both on Cape Cod their vibes
their aesthetic it's just so like
comforting when I watch their videos
because I just miss people out all the
time so I'm in like a month and a half
to Cape Cod but until then I like
watching their videos when I get the
chance I also love this out of
Emmett Chamberlain in general meeting
her in person she was like the nicest
was compassionate like caring person
like towards like other people and like
you can just tell she has like the best
heart until meeting a youtuber who just
really really like exemplifies like a
good overall world model it's just
something she's younger than me which is
so awesome but it's just like she's like
a really good role model I think for
people to look up to I really love
cardia Milan and Avenue helps but how do
you do stress ooh girl mm-hmm
unfortunately a lot of times when I'm
stressed I break down like I just have
mental breakdowns I don't cry
I should like I don't I never cry but
what I do is I just pretty much like
completely like my brain just shuts off
I think talking it out with people helps
like a lot of times I try and deals it
on my own so I'm like I don't want to
bother other people with my problems or
like you know bring anyone else down
with my sadness and crippling
 anxiety right now but when I
like call my mom or I call a friend and
like they talk it out with me or they
just listen sometimes I just need to
hear myself talk it out sometimes they
have enough thing to say sometimes
they're like yeah your situation sucks
but I think just talking to someone
because it makes you feel less alone
you're just like you know human
happens
oh another thing I do it's really bad
when I have stress is I pick at my acne
head clear skin for like two weeks and I
was like so excited about it and I was
like bragging about it everywhere and
they're like literally three days later
I got stressed out about something and I
destroyed my skin like my face and then
I was like wow I literally just said
like whoo you guys let me know if I
should drop a skin care routine and then
like three days later I like destroyed
my skin I have foundation on right now
so you can't tell but it's mm-hmm
everyone in the family group shot on
Instagram not in everything to me do you
have any siblings
I have a brother his name's Alex he's a
few years older than me and fun fact he
was the one who helped me set up my
youtube channel in like 2015 when I was
like I'm gonna be a youtuber and never
posted anything for like two years but
he is like me in a guy form like we look
a lot alike
but he's just like I don't know how to
describe my family but we are very weird
people who how hard was it moving to LA
like the actual process and how you felt
about it the actual move like when I
came to LA I was so excited I had no
fears I was just so excited to be here
then it didn't like the homesickness and
that whole like realized and what I just
done to my life and future didn't set in
until a few months into it and then I
was like oh my god I'm so far from home
and I think that the hardest thing is
realizing how hard it is to travel home
I missed out on a lot of things I miss
out on pretty much every holiday every
occasion every event there's a lot of
traditions that I miss out on and a lot
of family gatherings and I miss out on
and my friends and everything my dog so
it's the life that I chose so I don't
want to complain about it like I'm there
very happy with where I'm headed in life
but I'm just definitely like salty about
the fact that I don't have the luxury to
be close to home as often as I want to
because I'm like a homebody I keep my
circle small and so I want to be around
those people that like are my family and
best friends and when you live in LA you
never really have that friendship feel
you don't really have that home feel
because everyone's here for career so
you feel like everything that you're
surrounded by is just like Career Center
and unless you have something to offer
someone you feel like shitty sometimes
how'd you get out of a sudden depressed
mood girl you don't you marinate in that
 if you're feeling down let yourself
feel down like let yourself cry you need
to just like close your eyes and be like
okay what is it that I'm feeling like my
core like get rid of all outside like
distractions and be like why do I feel
like this and then just like marinate in
it and just be like this sucks
I'm just gonna feel like this for as
long as I need to and then I'm gonna
like find a way to feel better because
eventually you do need to figure it out
and feel better how do you get into a
routine
okay routines are so crucial to like any
type of lifestyle like healthy life
sound you want to have you can't just
like be all over the place you have to
have like a routine that you like enjoy
because it's all about the process
you're not gonna get anywhere if you
don't enjoy what you're doing to get
there like I wouldn't be where I am in
Fitness if I hated the workouts that I
was doing with I have to enjoy them then
sometimes that means switching them up
it all that finding what works for you
and what makes you happy I think every
new season I like to start a new routine
so spring summer fall winter I like to
have a brand new routine I said the
scene for that for myself by envisioning
it thinking about what I want to
manifest at that time I like to buy like
scents like candles and new things that
will kind of help me feel like I'm in a
new state of mind because you know
smells like they really like the spark
like memory I don't know what I'm saying
but I don't know something I got she is
thick a okay this is so good it's like
I'm wonderful now but it's fine
mmm good thing I know myself and I asked
for more sauce more life updates I
haven't told you who I'm moving in with
yep I'm moving in two weeks and I am so
excited our new place is absolutely
perfect I can't even put into words it
has so much character
not just like a regular standard
apartment it's not a lot either once we
tried to find a loft but it just feels
like very very very me it's so much more
open so much more lighting I I don't
want to like hype up things and then
like maybe your expectations aren't as
good as it will be but like I really
expect my life to will up mental low up
like living in a new area a new space
just getting my together because
right now I'm not really negative but I
don't feel good about like my apartment
and like this routine that I'm in I'm
just so sick of it I've had it for two
years I've had enough of downtown I've
had enough of this I just really need a
fresh start in LA and just I the person
with the mo if it's like the perfect
person to do it with my mom is flying
out here to help me move so that's
really exciting
I can't wait to vlog and like just
create so many memories okay I literally
just like put sauce on this like mmm I'm
trying to be a lot more relaxed in like
my mindset lately because sometimes I'm
like really stuck up and like really
like you know I think it's called a
type-a person but like you're I'm just
very like oh I sorry I can't hang out
tomorrow like I have work to do and I
have this due tomorrow and I've this and
this and this and like I have to work
out tonight I have to work out for an
hour and like this not and I realize
that like it's okay to like live in the
moment more often and I live in the
moment every second that you can if you
look want to follow your intuition I
also love that my things are trending on
you right now because I feel like it's
always been like low-key there's always
been this like low-key like shame that
like women shouldn't have appetites or
like one eat a lot of food but I am such
a foodie like I love love food I mean
like everyone does but when I get full
I'll stop but like I'm gonna be really
sad and this is over sometimes I do get
depressed after I eat and I think that's
not like a good thing but sometimes I'm
just like wow like I was really looking
forward to that meal and I had the
moment and now it's gone and now what's
next night like one write it now what do
I just look forward to the next meal I
have a good relationship with food like
I'm gonna show something I have a weird
relationship with food I just really
really enjoy food and I enjoy enjoying
my
and also even in finding foods that are
like still nourishing it's not I don't
eat to look good I don't workout to look
good like my body's gonna look how my
human body wants to look like I'm not
 animal like whatever wants
whatever my body appearance wants to
look like it will do I work out and do
things that just feel good and energize
my life in good ways so that I can be
like a positive person around other
people so we enjoy would enjoy life on
us now best advice you've ever received
no one ever gives me advice I am Who I
am because I figure things on my own and
because I was like a really big like
email tumblr tumblr user in like 2015
and if you know you know if you were an
evil w tumblr user in 2013 let me know
in the comments down below but like so I
just was like a deep person in general I
think the only one time that someone
gave me good advice that I was like wow
 ya was when I had my heart broken
in high school and I was like sobbing at
my friend's house and god bless her I
really appreciate that girl and
everything she did for me in my
childhood youth life of like my
craziness and I would I was like I'm
never gonna like find someone who I
connect with as much as this like person
and she was like but why would you want
to like clearly you and this person
didn't work out because like you just
were meant to be together like your
personalities didn't work together so
like you need to find someone else who's
completely different because like you
didn't get along with that person so why
would you think you get along with
someone who's just like that person find
some brand new and I was like damn you
right the last bite is so sad this is it
I feel good
we still have this cookie I'm just gonna
like it doesn't smell that fresh usually
they're like a lot fresher than that
lisanne we stand a queen I've had better
from them call it now my Chloe has like
the best desserts and like cookies I'm
sorry I'm so lost in this cookie right
now I'm agnostic anything let me know if
I should do more of these videos I
really really enjoyed this video also I
love you guys so much thank you for your
questions and thank you for spending
some time with me today I hope you have
a really good day and you just feel good
