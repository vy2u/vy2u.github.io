to Malibu with my roommate key on us we
spent the morning on a hike at Runyon
there's a little clip from that if
you're interested like really hot out
today so the hike was really difficult
but it's around three four o'clock right
now it's still like 80 degrees out so
cool the 8090 degrees out let me correct
myself so casual like I wish I could go
back in time three years ago and be like
hey Liv you know an average day for you
in LA is just going to be like driving a
Malibu when you feel like this is what
it looks like when girls try and find an
outfit to wear yep just kidding that's
clean laundry clean laundry keyword I
just haven't put it away at it's also
Earth Day so I'm going to take this
opportunity to say go vegan you know
this body literally by plant no animals
were harmed in the making of this
literally member meshell nice date like
I I just
we're gonna go to Malibu it's about four
times ready let's come
but I constructed a poll do you think we
listen to like really relaxing like 1975
like Ed Sheeran music while driving down
to Malibu but no we're literally those
things like trap music EDM like sudden
life the best player so um can you talk
about this like hello yes I would like
to marry you it's like vegan coconut I'm
going to taste that for the first time I
want like ruin it someone takes pictures
with it
we're talking about like how many kids
you want more alone now how did dream
like a week ago that I had five kids and
it was so much fun because like all my
life I didn't think I was that many kids
but it was so great because we all just
hit come out it was like you give birth
like five friends like that's fantast I
hate eating too much of your favorite
foods so they're not learning it anymore
I've done that with everything that I've
ever eaten
Michael ego we're on like oatmeal is so
good so it like twice a day every day
for like two weeks straight they don't
like what if I said I can never eat
oatmeal again and I'm like a month or
two will go by and I don't need it and I
like needs to eat a guy really my
favorite I was on that voice my favorite
things to do in Malibu are to Carly
Cochrane watching and watching even
better is an exciting sounds when I'm
off voice driving and a scholar
so happy that everyone could make it
today just a nice family dinner kinds of
messes like I'm sitting right here
well we made to the beach a it's a lit
the Sun is setting of ICH setting soon
doesn't even look real like all the
Italians they all just stand in
California is really not to be trusted
but now we're going to wait for the Sun
to start so excited us to be so great
thank you what I personally making fun
of because we took so many pixels and
not only talking to myself of cameras I
look so narcissistic but like I'm
okay kind of bad news so the Sun started
to set out of sight and we realized it
wasn't worth it to stay and watch
nothing happens
really so we're going to head home it's
so nice to get out of the city if you
live in like an urban area you know how
nice it is to get out of it a little bit
and associates down
oh yeah downtown LA it's literally
Attraction so it's so nice to be here
and just like breathe in fresh air can
suck when we give out and here's traffic
that I was talking about
