my channel so today I'm gonna show you
my fall nighttime routine and I'm just
gonna walk you through what an average
night in my life looks like so I just
got home from getting some groceries
changed into some comfier clothing I
went to put my hair up and then I
decided that I spent too long doing my
hair today and it deserved to stay down
for a little bit longer I'm not gonna
lie and then I poured some water because
you got to stay hydrated you guys that
is the key to success you already know
and then I unpacked all of my groceries
I just uploaded last week a gross shoot
me know a what I'm eating in a day so
you can go and watch that video if you
want to see like my healthy vegan fall
recipes there was a really good pumpkin
pancake recipe in that and I want to
know if any of you actually recreated it
because I love that recipe so then of
course being just like a typical
annoying teenager I'm on my phone I'm
not gonna lie to you guys I spend too
much time on my phone throughout the day
and I've really been trying to I don't
know kind of keep off of it but if you
want to add me on snapchat and Instagram
go for it and now I went into the
kitchen and decided that I wanted to
make my dinner because I was hungry I
bought this and I have never tried it
before and it was so gross you guys I'm
not gonna lie I got it because it was
Sunday night and I was like you know I
meal prep every night and I eat really
healthy so why not like treat myself
tonight get something fun and I never
get to have vegan mac and cheese so I
decided to pick some up and it was so
gross and it was not what I expected it
to be but I still show drew myself
eating it just because I look it I'm
like little bit contemplating what the
hell is this then I felt like I
literally needed something healthy right
afterwards so I ate some carrot and
while I try and decide if these had
already been washed or not in the
package I want to tell you guys
something that I've been doing recently
which is called mindful eating so
basically instead of watching YouTube
videos while I roll up my phones right
next to me in this clip but instead of
like being on my phone and watching
YouTube videos while I eat food like
usual I've been trying to just chill and
like just think about the food and the
nutrients
and just sort of like calm myself down
and like just really think about my
digestion while eating instead of like
being distracted in that way I can
really listen to my body and when it's
full and how I'm feeling while I'm
eating that was a lot I hope that I've
made sense whatever I just said anyways
now this is my favorite fall candle ever
that I just bought from Target I bought
it because beauty bloggers kept saying
that it would improve the quality of my
life they were right Tritan recommend
getting a fall candle I got this one
because I liked that it was decorative
but there's a lot of cheaper ones at
Target or just anywhere basically so now
I kind of do my last like work for the
day I check my emails most of the work
that I do is like email like social
media and online stuff so I was just
kind of ending that for the next I don't
want it to like go on for too long I
feel like sometimes I stay on my laptop
all day and so I just want to have like
get this out of the way to get whatever
outs out of the way that I need to get
done so basically what I do that I have
been loving lately is writing a to-do
list and I write it on my laptop instead
of in my passion planner because I just
have so much going on that this is just
so much easier for me to do for some
reason so yeah basically you can see
that every day I raise the dates and
then I just write down like bullet
points of everything that I need to do
and it's just keeps me organized for the
week and then I remembered that the Sun
was setting and I wanted to go and be
present in this moment so let's just
enjoy this right now
after getting back from watching the
sunset I came home and realized too that
I needed some meal prep some breakfast
for the week because I didn't have any
so I just know perhaps him oatmeal
really quickly like I said before if you
want to see like what I'm eating here
today go ahead and watch my last video
but yeah I always eat overnight oats and
they're so easy to make in advance and
then I've been loving having tea at
nighttime so this is my mug from Urban
Outfitters that I just got and I got
decaf green tea my favorite is just
really simple and then I add a cinnamon
stick for a flavor and it helps my
digestion and call my stomach after
dinner and then I added some of these
organic essential oil drops from sage
and yeah that was basically my tea and I
drink this while I do my skincare
routine and just throughout the night as
I kind of wind down and then of course
the time must come to take off your
makeup sometimes this moment is really
sad because nobody really saw my makeup
that day or I just feel like I put so
much time and effort into it that it
kind of sucks to take off but alas
everything in life is temporary
okay so I'm just taking off micellar
water and then I'm washing my face with
a base walls from the glossier let me
know if you want to see and updated
skincare routine because I really feel
like my skincare has gotten a lot better
there was a moment in my life where I
was really stressed and just I don't
know what my skin was so bad from it and
so now I feel like I have things a
little bit more together and then I put
on in overnight moisturizer face mask
and then this is what I use to brush my
teeth and then I just relax
I brought my candle in semi remand
because I am extra and then I was
watching this vegan youtuber who I love
and she's literally the funniest person
ever she's a chill vegan and you should
go watch her what I eat videos cuz
they're hilarious also let me know if
you have any youtuber recommendations
because I'm always looking for new
people to watch so comment them down
below like who your favorite people are
right now and then I pick up my room
because that is so important to me
because being organized and just being
like clean at the end of the night helps
me feel like the next morning when I
wake up it helps me feel like I'm just
more put together and one less thing is
on my plate and then I'm just watching
YouTube in bed and then I really didn't
really want to be like on my phone
anymore or anything I was over it so
I started to write in my journal and
this is just a sample I'm not going to
show you like what I actually wrote in
my journal entry because that's super
personal but if you don't do this I
really recommend just trying it like try
it look once or twice like a week or
just everyday like what I do is like
just basically but I'm inspired pick up
my journal and I write down things that
are on my mind and it really really
hopes declutter my mind helps me sleep
better I feel like I get everything off
my chest and a lot of times I come to
epiphanies and like realize things while
writing in my journal and I just
basically like pour my heart out into it
sometimes and it's really like the
healthiest thing you can do you realize
things you didn't even know we're on
your mind and then after that I always
kiss it just I don't know why it's like
the my tradition and I've talked about
this book on a million and one times on
my snapchat and everywhere I don't know
like for the longest time I take the
only book I read and basically if you
know the law of attraction is there's a
bunch of other laws like the law say the
law of no judgments the law of the
present moment like there's a bunch of
them and you can screen drop this and
pause this and next one just to read
them over a little bit but I really
recommend this book more than anything
in the world a lot of the advice that I
give to you guys comes from this book
this book is everything to me so just
please like give it a try and then
lastly I'm just kind of like relaxing
with some YouTube videos I download an
app for meditation and it wasn't working
so I just used YouTube and I use this
application on my phone that everyone
should have that just sets an alarm and
it wakes you up really gently I try and
sleep eight hours I don't like to go
over or under and it keeps me on a good
rhythm and I just adjust it every night
when I need to and that is it thank you
so much for spending this time with me
and I will see you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
