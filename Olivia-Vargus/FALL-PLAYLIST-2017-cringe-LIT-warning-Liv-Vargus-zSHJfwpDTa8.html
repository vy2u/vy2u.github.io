rewarding that this video is really
cringey so enjoy hey guys I just hit my
leg so hard during that hey guys what is
up and welcome back to my channel if
you're new here my name is live feel
free to subscribe and join my family I
make new videos every Monday and Friday
today I'm gonna be showing you my fall
playlist so I'm only gonna show you
songs that I think that are the best of
the best right now I'm not gonna show
you songs that like you already know
about I'm gonna try and show you new
songs that you can add to your playlist
and get list 2 with me I'm gonna put
these all onto a Spotify playlist and do
my best to share it with you guys by the
time this video post right now I'm
playing it from Apple music and I don't
know how to share music on Apple music
if some of these songs aren't for some
reason on the Spotify playlist I'm gonna
also leave the names of the songs with
the artists on the screen you can
screenshot that I'm definitely ready to
make an idiot of myself in this video
I'm notorious for never knowing the
words to any songs but like singing
along to them anyways you know what I
mean I also I'm gonna make an idiot of
myself in this video I already know that
I can't dance for I really can't
even lip-synch for so why am I
making this video it's because I love
music and I love you guys I don't want
to share my music with you guys as
always comment down below what your
favorite songs are so that I can go and
check them out and we can share them
with each other and if you like this
video give it a thumbs up and subscribe
let's get into it
what I get
Oh
two things that I've noticed so far one
if you mute this video and watch it it's
probably the funniest and cringes thing
ever - if my mom is watching this video
I can see her facial expression right
now looking at the screen is so
concerned I want to say this claimer
that a lot of these songs are explicit
so watch it your own this next song is
the cutest song of all time it literally
makes me cry of happiness I don't see
you so precious when you smile
to let you know you're
I'm so happy yeah a lot of you
guys doing this long because it's
popular but it's Sam Smith's new song
which is like good but the snake hips
remix of it better
okay what I'm about to share with you
guys is going to either scare you or be
a good part of the video I don't know
but I'm obsessed with little peep little
peep actually it's how it's called I'm
doing about obviously this but he's more
like emo music and I love it a lot so
I'm gonna go so hard on these songs and
I've played some of these for my friends
and I don't think they expect me to like
lose my mind when I listen to them but
like I will I want to start off with my
favorite one from him and then I'm gonna
play two other ones
this shot the pillow
I like apologize like I'm really sorry
all right we're gonna play see more of
him though
we
I
Oh
okay you guys so I don't know you but I
got a pretty good workout in there he's
sweating I wish I had like a prize for
you for making to the end of the video
but I don't so thank you for sitting
through this cringefest like I said I
will leave a link below to all the songs
that I played and give the 30 thumbs up
if you want to see more of these videos
like maybe every season or a monthly or
whenever I can because I love music and
I love like I'm so happy to be able to
share some of these with you guys cuz
you might know some of them but I'm
hoping that you don't know all of them
so that I can give you some new music
anyways love you lot have a great day
