channel today I'm gonna be filming a
fitness and health day my life vlog and
this video is sponsored by eight fit
eight fit is a fitness and nutrition app
for both men and women who maybe don't
have a lot of time and want short but
effective workouts from home you can
adopt the app to your own lifestyle so
for example I'm vegan and so I'm able to
adapt it to that diet and they have a
huge database of vegan recipes for me
I'm gonna show you everything that I'm
eating from their app today and I all
have the mobile apps linked at the top
of my description box and you guys
should definitely go and download it and
give it a try so I'm gonna have my first
meal of the day right now which is
breakfast obviously and then I'm gonna
do a workout from home after that and
I'll show you that my first meal today
is my oatmeal that I have prepped
already because it was overnight oats I
am going to show you me cooking the rest
of my meals today but this one I made
last night and you guys know much
overnight
oh so the app has over 700 recipes and
they add new ones monthly and the
recipes are so creative and so easy to
make I'm not just saying that and you
can literally create your own meal plan
on the app and it'll create a shopping
list for you it'll show you the
nutrition value of everything that
you're making so for example breakfast
this morning is overnight oats but it's
not just normal videos all I put in this
is oats on the milk instant coffee and
cinnamon and then I topped it with dates
and I put it in the fridge overnight and
it smells so amazing like this should be
on the Starbucks menu okay it tastes
better than like a Starbucks drink make
sure you add the cinnamon because that
taste so good oh my freaking God this is
so good okay so I'm going to eat my
breakfast and then we do workout a
little bit
so see you then okay so I just got
changed and ready to start my workout
and all the workouts on a if it can be
done at home with no commit necessary I
really like that there are home workouts
cuz when I'm busy I get stressed out not
having the time to go to the gym I'm
gonna go downstairs to my gym to do this
workout and I'm gonna bring you with me
and I'm gonna also do a little bit of
cardio and you can log any additional
workouts that you do besides the limit
they have you do that day
onto the app so it will count for you so
yeah it's good
so it pretty much creates personalized
workouts for what you're aiming for so
for me I like to strength train but
right now because I just got back from
London I'm feeling kind of I gotta shave
I just want to get like into like a fit
level again so this is the workout that
I'm gonna be doing today on the screen
and now let's get into it
okay so you're basically supposed to do
that same workout three times so it's
three more sets of those reps so I just
added this 15 ton weight so my squats
and then other things but you can
literally do this without any weights
and no still have an effective workout I
also bought wait so I own them upstairs
in my apartment too so if I only need to
do this entire thing from home I
definitely good so I'm gonna finish the
other two start grid so I'll probably
take like a one minute rest between each
circuit that's what I recommend and then
I'm gonna do about 20 minutes
just walk left on and then
would run today
so after 50 minutes on the treadmill
that's pretty much a 30-minute workout
and honestly like most days I like to do
30-minute workout just because like it's
enough but it's not like too much the
entire rest of the day over the winter I
was doing like to our workouts and like
I loved having kind of like that but
right now I just don't so 30 minutes
high-intensity you still feel really
great afterwards okay so for lunch I'm
gonna make there smashed white beans on
bread I thought this recipe will be good
because a lot of people always eat
avocado toast but I have an avocado
allergy which I actually put into the
app so they gave me this option instead
so I got white beans at a strange about
in this one of these colanders and now
I'm gonna put them into this bowl and
I'm gonna smash them up and then I also
have two pieces of toasted wheat
bryden's and then on top of that I'm
gonna put arugula salad and I think that
will be a really filling lunch it says
to use about half a cup of the white
beans so that's I'm going to put the
rest in a little storage container okay
so here's the toast with the smashed
beads on them and that was ready to
smash and then I'm gonna put what about
lemon pepper on one half and put regular
cover on the other half so you they
don't like the lemon pepper but this has
no salt in it it's just a really good
yeah it's a really nice seasoning and
then I just bought about of baby arugula
and I'm gonna put that on top of
everything okay this looks so good I'm
gonna think this is my room now to eat
it and I'll show you a closer up this is
obviously a simple recipe it gives me
like literally two minutes or less to
make I just toasted bread drain some
beans put them on top and it literally
looks
then you guys review so I'm gonna try
the piece of the lemon nut pepper on it
cuz I think that that will add more
flavor
okay this was so basic but it tastes
like so good I'm gonna eat this and then
I'll see you in a little bit probably
when I have a snack before dinner
okay so my snack recipe was thinking of
berry bowls so the dairy free yogurt
that I got is the unsweetened vanilla so
delicious coconut milk yogurt I'm going
to put half of a cup of that into here
and then I'm gonna add berries they said
to add a little bit of just regular oats
on the top and then coconut chips for
some extra coconut ephod and then lastly
a little bit of cinnamon and I love that
we put cinnamon and everything cuz it's
just like yeah okay this is so adorable
obviously again so simple because that's
why I set all my preferences dudes like
really simple at fast and easy to make
okay I'm gonna again eat this is my room
I don't usually have a yogurt because
it's not something I think I got
obviously dairy I love that we put
cinnamon on everything okay so my dinner
today is gonna be toast little pepper
skewers with bacon potato it's not gonna
take me that much makes I'm just gonna
make the potato in the microwave like I
usually do
wait do I lose viewers I didn't buy any
I doubt I just have skewers laying
around of immunity
ok no I don't feel free to call me an
idiot in the comments below actually
don't do that I'm really sensitive
please don't do that
alright well I guess let's get cooking
so I'm gonna start off by cutting the
Tosa so this packet has two servings in
it this is the sriracha flavored tofu
and it's pre baked but I'm gonna be
putting it on the stove just to heat it
up and get it crispy and it's pretty
seasoned and I'm just thriving I'm
living my best life um it fit didn't
tell me to buy preseason tofu but she
don't tell them my distance I really
like my olive oil spray from Trader
Joe's so I'll put this on the stove too
so that way does it stick okay look at
our of tofu which isn't fall yay so the
next step is to get a couple of potatoes
and I'm gonna cut these up into wedges
after I scrub them okay so I cut all my
potatoes into these cute little wedges
and I put them on a plate with a wet
towel and I'm gonna like to wrap them in
this tumor towel and then I'll put this
in the microwave for three minutes
meanwhile last thing that we have to cut
up is the red bell pepper oh it's now
I'm going to go and add my red bell
pepper to the stove so that I have cut
up and it's gonna join my toes whoo I
really wish you guys could smell this
right now it smells like heaven so I
ended up putting a little bit of chopped
cilantro on top of everything and then I
added some more of the lemon pepper
seasoning that I picked up and then I
added some hot sauce on the top of the
potatoes so now let's go try it out I'm
gonna eat in my bedroom again like I've
been doing this whole day so it's cool
okay so I have my laptop desk here on my
bed and I'm
the presentation of this one a little
bit too much it really really took an L
for not having skewers I get an A for
effort
