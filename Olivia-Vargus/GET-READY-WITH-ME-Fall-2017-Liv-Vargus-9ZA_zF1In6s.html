is Liv I upload new videos every Monday
at Friday and I would love for you to
join my family and subscribe today I'm
gonna be giving you a fall get ready
with me I'm gonna do a makeup and then
I'll show you my hair and how I got all
of this done this is a great look for
school or work or just living your best
life so before I get into the video I
want to share with you guys one of my
favorite things that I've been doing
lately that I really felt like has
helped me glow up for this fall so this
video is actually being sponsored by way
with style because they're on my side of
things and they want to help you guys go
up just as much as I do so I'm gonna
show you how I use their teeth whitening
kits so I have always been an avid
coffee drinker I used to always drink
off of the straw to avoid staining my
teeth but now that it's like fall winter
I kind of like drinking hot coffee which
you cannot drink with a straw I've been
just drinking it block and my teeth have
been suffering the color damages so I've
never tried this before I never thought
that I'd be the kind of person to do
this but basically what y'all need to
know is that this retails for two
hundred and sixty nine dollars but with
my discount code Olivia Vargas us can
get this kit I just was sure that you
didn't hear me did you hear me I said
twenty eight dollars like that's such a
good price to whiten your teeth with
like a look at my teeth so to use this
it's so effortless you just need to take
a side thirty minutes of your time and I
like the multitask so sometimes I'll do
my hair while I'm doing this my skincare
routine so they send you these like
teeth trades you just mold them to your
teeth you put the gel on it and then you
put it into your mouth
you smile and you just keep it in there
for 30 minutes and voila so easy and I
really always underestimate how big of a
difference white teeth makes in my
appearance but it really does blow off
you guys so if you liked this video
please make sure that you give me thumbs
up and now I'm just gonna show you my
fall get ready with me alright let's get
started
so after took a shower I put my hair in
braids so that they would dry like this
so we'll take these out later and see
they look like the first thing that you
always want to do is moisturize and
prime I'm going to start off with lip
balm this is from Trader Joe's and it's
the best actually already moisturize and
I'm working on a skincare routine for
you guys to give this video a thumbs up
if you want to see a full skincare
routine um but we're gonna prime so I'm
going to use glossy age primer and this
stuff smells so good it's lavender
alright so I just put these two Beauty
blenders these are from Ecotools I'm
going to start off by putting the fenty
Beauty contour stick called linen so
this is the light shade under my eyes
and then I'm gonna put my foundation
over that for foundation I'm going to
use the Too Faced peaches and cream
collection in the shade nude and love
this stuff and it smells so good and
this finish is really nice it's matte
but it's not super matte and like I've
said I have dry skin so I can't really
wear of matte foundations cuz it just
makes me look dead so this stuff's
actually was really nice
okay so as you can see the finish on
this foundation is just so nice and
smooth and it's a full coverage but it
doesn't feel super cakey so I really
like it
then I'm gonna take the fancy Beauty
contour stick in amber and I'm gonna use
it to contour I like this because I got
it as the trio that um she sells the
path so I think at them individually
I bought the light package of contour
sticks and this is for full tone skin
which is perfect it's so hard to find
bronzer for a full tone skin because
everything's usually super warm so this
is more of a grayscale and it's amazing
so now we have a little bit more
definition on my round face and speaking
of cool tone skin I just got the Manic
Panic purple hair dye that everyone uses
to like tone their brassy hair it's
coming in the mail next Wednesday but
I'm hoping to use it to try and turn my
ombre hair into more of a silver cool
tone hair because I realized that I'm
not into this this look anymore shouts
my hairdresser from home was watching
this right now and she's probably like
live don't do it girl
I'll see you into somewhere if you want
to fix whatever I do to it but I think
I'm gonna give it a try and if all else
fails or distract diet all over cool
tone Brown and then we'll just deal with
into summer but it's so hard finding
hairdressers in Los Angeles that aren't
like five hundred dollars cause like why
would I do that what I could also just
like order her man was on for $10 and do
it myself so as far as face that's
obviously kind of what I do and not I'm
gonna move on some eyebrows because I
can't look at these any more hair
there's like nothing there to look at
honestly I've had the same brow routine
for ages I'm so loyal to Anasazi as dip
prop to brow in the shade dark brown so
I'm gonna use that and basically I'm
gonna go underneath blend it up and then
I'm gonna create more of an arch and
that's it and it stays on all day it's
so good love this stuff
seriously you guys look at the
difference between my two eyebrows right
not like okay so that means like obvious
is the biggest difference in the world
now we're going to curl my lashes and do
my own makeup for mascara I'm going to
use my sample size of the Too Faced
better than sex mascara this is I bought
the sample size because I couldn't
remember if I actually liked it or not
and I definitely do I'm actually
considering getting eyelash extensions
again soon so you used to have been a
long time alone like I loved it but I
don't know if it's like worth it's a
time and effort and then after like
three days they fall out and you're like
well now I don't look good so so today
I'm just going to put this on and then
we'll revisit this eyelash extension
idea like later in the future the next
step that I've been loving is putting
some of the brown eyeliner from Kylie
cosmetics a little bit smudged on my top
lash line and then a little bit smudged
on my bottom lash line last thing that
I'm going to do is I'm going to take
starstruck from 50 Beauty which came in
that trio that I showed you I'm gonna
put this on my highlight nose and on my
eyebrows eyelids
to finish up I put those Smiths rosebuds
asal on my lips and then a little bit of
the sample size tartlet paint that I got
birthday collection on top of that all
right so now it's time to see what my
hair looks like in these braids when I
think about so whoo all right so look
today it's super curly it'll probably
fall out throughout the day I think
right now I'm just gonna take a
straightening iron and go over some of
the front pieces and the ends to kind of
tame it a bit if you liked this video
