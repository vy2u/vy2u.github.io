my channel so today I'm going to be
showing you my morning and my night time
skincare routine so you really get to
see everything that I do to get good
skin I'm so excited to finally be able
to film this video because first so long
I had just really bad acne and you can
probably see in my old videos my old
pictures and everything and I put a lot
of time and effort into my skincare and
I think that this one thing that I'm
going to show you during my night
routine is what really really changed
the game for me but as you can see I
think that I'm doing a pretty good job
at keeping my skin clear right now best
thing you can do for clear skin is
obviously drink water have a good diet
and exercise I like to balance both of
those things into my life and I've made
some videos about it if you want to see
what I'm doing for like my diet and
exercise kind of stuff you can watch
some of the other videos on my channel
and there's going to be so many more
videos about that kind of stuff my
channel in the future so feel free to
subscribe while you're here right now to
get notified when those go up and also
follow me on like Instagram Twitter
snapchat their usual always blog so
without further adieu let's just get
right into the video and I'm going to
walk you through my morning skincare
routine first so I've used all my
morning routine I usually take a shower
in the morning after I work out and I
wash my face with this charcoal cleanser
from yes to Tomatoes
I let it sit on my face in the shower
for a few minutes before I wash it off
and I think that it leaves my skin
feeling pretty good right when I get out
of the shower I put on this Pacifica hot
vegan mask which I love as you can see
the consistency is a little watery and a
little weird but I let it sit on my face
for about 15 minutes and I really like
the way it makes my face feel while it's
sitting on my skin I feel like it really
just cleanses and kind of right into my
complexion before I put on makeup so
after about 10 to 15 minutes I use a wet
washcloth and I just completely take it
off my skin usually I do this in the
face but I'm just showing you it here
for reference you can see right after I
take that mask off I instantly like to
moisturize because they say that right
after you shower just sooner that you
moisturize the better for your skin
because it will absorb it faster so
first I'm going to kind of tone my skin
with this rose oil that my friend left
at my house
and I've been using and I love it and
basically I just put this on my cheeks
and my forehead and I've had it and rub
it in and I really really really feel
like this gets rid of any redness or
unevenness that my skin has which I have
a lot of onions in zone issues so as you
can see like the before and after you
kind of see that a lot of the redness
that I had on the middle of my face kind
of settles down a little bit so I
definitely recommend using if you don't
want to spend too much on this you can
also get just a rose water a lot of
people like Morrow's and as soon as rose
water a really good cruelty free
drugstore brand called pixie and makes
another world watery that you can use to
anything like rose kind of centric will
basically get rid of the retinas on your
face after that I self tan my face about
three times out of a week and I love
this organic self tanner that I got off
Amazon I've talked about before because
I really feel like it doesn't clog my
skin it's so lightweight and it smells
so good in therapeutic so I put this on
it gives me such good glow and I think
that this also helps to even out my skin
tone I see a gradual tan develop within
3 hours and I love that so it's
definitely my favorite favorite favorite
products I will link it down below
because I love it that much and
definitely go check it out I think that
a lot of people are scared to put self
tanner on their face it was just stuff
it's so gentle that I really don't mind
it and you can see here like I
definitely look like I have a nice tan
and Jen after that I use my daily
moisturizer that I've been using for
like literally a year now every purchase
of this product a couple times because I
just think it's a really nice like cheap
and a really hydrating moisturizer so I
use that and then I let that sit on my
face and I tend let all of that sit
there for a couple minutes and then I
take this lush product that I got this
is a really good product for oily skin
and basically I just take it and dot it
right on my cores and right where I get
oily during the day I think if we have
pretty dry skin so I keep this only
around my nose because that's the only
place that I get oily when I lived on
the East Coast and in a more humid
climate I used to use this stuff as a
daily moisturizer because I was so oily
now that I live in a more dry and desert
climate on the west
I don't use it as much but I take a very
little bit and I put it right on my nose
so yeah and then after that I just go
about my regular makeup routine for the
day if you want to see an updated makeup
routine comment down below and like this
video
positive match throughout the day my
makeup stays on pretty well I think that
my skin stays really hydrated I drink a
lot of water
I ate a lot of fruits and vegetables and
now for my nighttime routine so I start
by taking my makeup off with my phony
Grail micellar water this stuff is
really hydrating when you take off your
makeup so I absolutely love it I just
use some cotton pads and I usually use
about one and I take up all my
foundation and then lately I've been
loving using this coconut oil and I've
just been taking my eye makeup off with
that because it really helps you to get
any sort of waterproof like hard stuff
on makeup off of your face so I use that
and I think off my eye makeup
anything else is on my face and I kind
of rub it into my skin then I go back in
with another pad of my micellar water
and I just wipe everything off my face
get all of the makeup off of it so
basically that's how I take my makeup
off and it always does a good job it is
I don't wear a lot of makeup but I don't
take my face that much I don't even
really wear eye makeup so that's what
works best for me and so after all my
makeup is off I've been loving using
this mask from Pacifica and it's
basically a mask that you keep on
overnight and when you wake up your skin
is just hydrated and just really bright
so I put that onto my face I let it soak
in for a little bit and then finally the
last step that I told you was going to
be the best stuff ever and it's really
what clearing my skin because I had so
much asked me on my cheeks
beautifully I take my tea tree oil with
a cotton swab
I dip the cotton swab inside of the
bottle and I use it and I dab it onto
anywhere that I feel there is a people
for bing there was a pimple and there's
a scar left over there is a simple with
anywhere that I feel like needs to like
diminish basically I just put it
anywhere where there is any signs of ask
me at all and I let that soak into my
skin overnight there's a lot of
different drawing lotions out there and
different things that you can use for
this but I really just like the way into
the tea tree oil does a job really well
really fast it's the main ingredient and
a lot of acne
and serums and stuff so I really think
that just buying it like on its own with
nothing else mixed into it and just
applying it really carefully to your
acne is what got rid of my acne so I
really contributed everything that I did
in this video to the start of having
clear skin funding for the first time in
my life clear skin will really have you
out here feeling like a goddamn queen
and I want all my followers to be Queens
