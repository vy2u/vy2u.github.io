channel if you new here my name is live
I make new videos every Monday at Friday
and feel free to subscribe and join our
family today I'm gonna be showing you my
hair care routine show you everything
that I do to take care of my hair that I
have on braids right now so this is my
natural root color and then this down
below is what I just kind of did to it
looks super pink and purple we'll talk
about that later in the video as to why
it does so before I get into this video
I'm thinking about changing my hair soon
I'll put a picture up here what I'm
thinking I want to change it too but
leave me your suggestions and your
thoughts down below what you think if
you think that this hair was look good
on me if I was a little bit tanner and
if you think that I could pull this off
or any other suggestions that you have
like what you think but I really need
your help because I'm so bad at figuring
out my hair so please let me know it on
below so basically what I'm gonna do
today is I'm gonna start off by toning
my hair with a purple hair thing I'll
show you so this is Manic Panic
and it is a cruelty free and vegan brand
I bought this on Amazon in the shade
purple and what I do with this is that I
dilute it with conditioner and I'm gonna
put it in my hair by doing this I get
rid of the yellow tones and I get more
of a cool tone and I'm diluting it so
it's not like supposed to be this purple
is it kind of turned out today but
that's my fault but it's gonna be more
like cool tone which is what it's what
we want and then after that I will show
you all the other products that I use
and how I style my hair so if you like
this video feel free to give it a thumbs
up but now let's get into it so the
first thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
just get a regular cup or I used a mug
and I'm gonna put the conditioner in the
cup I'm just gonna eyeball it but I put
in about 1/2 of a cup and then I take
about a little spoonful of the Manic
Panic stuff and I mix it all together
and by diluting this it just creates the
perfect leaving conditioner and then I
put that in my hair so this is a
time-lapse of me just putting it all
through my hair from roots to ends and
just really making sure that it covers
every strand and then I'm gonna leave
that in my hair for an hour maybe a
little bit less today I left it in for
an hour but maybe if you don't want it
to be as purple put it in for like half
that time and then after you're done
wash it out with cool water in the
shower and basically that's it you get
to style it as usual the thing that I
like
Manic Panic is that it's like
nondamaging it's semi-permanent it's not
like chemically it's not like dangerous
there's really no way that you can
really mess this up because it's like a
temporary hair dye
it's just purple made from like
vegetable dyes so it's really really
basic to use and it doesn't smell like
anything bad it's just really safe and
like harmless basically so don't be
worried about me or like what I'm doing
my hair I do this treatment about once a
week and I like doing it on Sundays
because as someone you know sundays are
my self-care days so on Sundays I do
like to take a little bit of extra time
to put into my beauty routine and that
way I feel really good throughout the
week but yeah so now that you just saw
how I do the hair treatment I'm gonna
take a shower and then we're gonna go
from there on how I style my hair okay
guys so I took a shower and I washed the
purple out and then I just did like some
makeup so you can see what it would look
like all put together when I'm done so
far I can already tell that the hair is
a little bit more purple than I usually
let it get to because I think that when
I made the solution I added too much
purple and I left it on for too long so
those two factors are gonna make it
stronger but basically if you don't want
it to be less intense than this and this
is it when it's wet I'm gonna dry it so
but if you wanted to be less intense I
suggest that you just add less purple
it's better when you're first starting
to do like less than more and then you
can always like get a feel for and add
more later if you're more comfortable
I'm fine with it being this purple
because I know that it will wash out so
before I blow-dry my hair I'm going to
use the not your mother's way to grow
leave-in conditioner this stuff is so
awesome it's cruelty free and it's so
cheap I got it at Ulta and it smells
amazing also but it makes my hair so
soft like better than any other product
i've ever used like i've used it's a ten
and i don't even like that stuff like it
makes my hair too oily so this is so
perfect and it's great on damp hair so i
just spray it and then i like kind of
comb through it with my fingers and let
it get to all of the different strands
and now we're gonna blow dry
i actually really need a new blow drying
iron so let me know if you have any
suggestions below that like aren't crazy
expensive because i don't want to spend
like $200 but if you have any like good
ones this is an old i think this is like
a really really old Conair one that I've
had forever
okay so now this is what it looks like
after blow-drying it and now I'm going
to curl it the curling one that I use is
by Amica and it has interchangeable
barrels and I got this for Christmas a
couple years ago but I think that a good
curling iron is like a really good
investment and I'm gonna let it heat up
to 350 degrees Sam's gonna take my
curling wand and do each strand of hair
curling it away from my face and then
mixing a few in that are curling towards
my face I just hold it for a few seconds
pretty basic
so I spray this Amiga hair perfume and
it's the scent
0:01 I don't know if there's any other
ones but that's what it says on the
bottom I'm gonna take this and spray it
on my hair and this is a perfume
basically so it doesn't do anything here
but it makes you smell good and it
smells so good highly recommend I got
this at Urban Outfitters actually but
find this and smell it and tell me it's
not amazing and I love hair perfume
because then I feel like when I move
like you can just smell it like it
activates it so I really love that and
this is the finished look you guys so I
just basically run my hands through my
curls kind of loosen them up a bit and
then this is basically how it is and
I've been really loving this right now I
know that is super pink purple right now
I definitely did the conditioning
treatment for a little bit too long but
it will wash out completely you know be
like a really nice like cool toned
blonde next time that I shower but for
the most part I like it for like an
at-home toning like I said please
comment down below letting me know any
hair suggestions that you guys have for
me I'm really thinking that I want to do
this dark hair color but let me know
what your thoughts are in the comments
below thank you so much for watching
today's video comment down below any
other videos that you want to see for me
and I love you guys so much have an
amazing day and slow your week I will
see you later
