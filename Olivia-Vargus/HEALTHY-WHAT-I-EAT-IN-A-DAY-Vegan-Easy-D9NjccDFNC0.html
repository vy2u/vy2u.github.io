to my channel my name is live if you do
here and today I'm gonna be showing you
what I eat throughout the day so I vegan
diet and I try nivas plant-based as
possible and I try and get as much
nutrients nutrition nutritional value I
don't know why this so hard for me to
say into my diet every day today in
particular I did not work out and it was
a pretty lazy day so I usually packing
more protein and I'll show you where I
do that as I go through the day you guys
have been asking for a lot more health
related videos and I'm so happy to get
them to you so make sure if you're not

really want to see if anybody who

think cuz they're so good and before I
show you what I ate tonight I do want to
give a big THANK YOU to Homme nutrition

obsesses hum for so many years and I
actually have done so many school
projects on them so I know so much about
their brand also if you like any of the
products that I show from plum in this
video you can get a 50% off discount go

all-natural line of supplements and
powders that I should say Lee source
non-gmo many of them are also vegan
which is so throughout today we're gonna
show you what I'm getting I'm going to
show you the things that I thought and
use from humm and I'm so in love with
its brands I hope that you guys like
them too but now let's just get into
this video okay so if you've seen any of
my other videos including it's my
morning routines or just any of my other
one I eat it is I always start my day
with a liter of water and a cup of the
donut shop dark roast coffee and I
always drink that when I do some work
and then today I had an apple before I
was planning on going
and I decided that I actually gonna have
period cramps and I just couldn't do it
today apples taste so good to me in the
morning because I don't feel like
they're really filling but they feel
like they really detox me it's kind of
like for me other people with drinking
lemon water like I like to eat an apple
and especially now that it's like fall
and it's like almost apple season like
it they're so good now after I had that
I have my favorite thing in the world
which is overnight oats you guys know I
love this and I've made it so many times
for you but today I wanted to make it a
little bit more nutritionist instead of
just adding cherries I usually do I
added the regular serving size of
oatmeal and almond milk and then I added
into that half a serving size of chia
seeds because I didn't want too many
because chia seeds and I are like
friends and foes like I don't know if I
actually like them or not
but I actually like the way that it came
out in this and then I found this frozen
bag of with a faery blend at Trader
Joe's and I added that in and not tasted
so good so you just put that in the
fridge overnight and I usually milk up
about 3 or 4 of these and that lasts me
from obviously four days and so that's
like my meal prep breakfast for the week
which is so easy on the go and I
absolutely think it tastes so amazing so
definitely tweet me if you try
themselves and then a little bit later
in the afternoon I decided that I wanted
to have my hair vitamins from home and
I'm so obsessed with these you guys okay
I should take him before and after
pictures but I actually think it's
helping my hair growth so much that my
hair feels like it's gotten thicker and
just longer and like I'm not just saying
this like I want you guys to understand
me I actually am obsessed they taste so
good I take two of them which is like
the recommended daily amount but if I
can save more I would do these hair
vitamins contain a 510 folic acid fo
tides Inc and Papa I only know about ten
days of that list and zinc but I really
really love these and they just make me
very happy
so next today I wanted to make a nice
like fall lunch and I was craving sweet
potatoes so I have thought 8000 my
Trader Joe's but I had no idea what I
wanted to do with them so I thought that
I would give this recipe a trying to my
first time making it and I really really
loved it so basically I took the sweet
potato and put it in the microwave like
I usually do and then I cut it up into
pieces and I used it in my pancake
recipe that I always thank you guys
Nana's but instead I pursue potatoes so
I put in sweet potato if you don't have
old flour you can literally just use
opium but I put that into a blender with
a lot of almond milk so that it blends
properly and I blended that up and then
I added in a certain size of pumpkin
puree which I had from last year and
hadn't used yet and I don't know why
because it's the best thing ever
and then I added a nutmeg my favorite
favorite thing is nutmeg so I put in a
lot of nutmeg and then I put in cinnamon
and I blend it all together some more on
and off and then I made pancakes out of
it and you have to kind of cook these on
a medium heat and let them sit on the
stove for honestly each pancake needs to
sit for two minutes on either side to
cook enough otherwise they're too mushy
so I cooked about five of them I think
was the amount I put together the other
half of the Apple that I cut up even
more with some nutmeg and some cinnamon
and if I had some sugar out out that to
it but it's already really sweet I did
out a tablespoon of syrup just because I
thought that I might need it to like
sweeten it but I realize now that I
definitely didn't need that I did not
need to add the extra sugar I could have
just eaten as it was it had plenty of
nutrients and no added sugar but I did
it wasn't a lot of sugar so it doesn't
really matter but it tasted so amazing
you guys like I am obsessed with this it
was such a good midday meal and so then
a little bit after that I decided that I
wanted like a pick-me-up and I was
really craving like chocolate or
something sweet and so this was so
perfect for that so it's the mint
chocolate chip flavored green superfood
powder from humm so this is honestly so
good at first your life that's really
minty and then you're like that's really
chocolatey and now you're like that's
perfect basically what attracted me to
this is that it wasn't like it's not a
meal replacement it's not like high in
protein but it's basically like a
multivitamin in a shake form so it helps
boost your energy and give you radiant
skin and metabolism and that's what I
won from it is I basically wanted
radiant skin because my skin's been so
bad lately and so I wanted a superfood
powder that would actually target that
and this really does that so I've been
trying this every
single day for about two weeks now and I
think that my skin has literally never
looked better and I think it's a
combination of like a lot of things but
I really love this and it is like a
really good that could be anything after
you drink it I feel like I'm just hum
also sent me their big trail by two big
drill Big Chill vitamins and I actually
really love these going a human
tranquilizer but I didn't want to take
it yesterday and I wasn't gonna like
pretend to take it on camera because I
wasn't really like doing my Chester that
guy was already chilled out in this
would have just made me really chill but
it's taken this a couple times in the
morning and like tried to like mansour
how I feel throughout the day and it
basically it calms my anxiety pretty
well but it still keeps me focused
I'm still trying these out but like I
actually am like pretty surprised they
still work so I thought nothing would be
a placebo but I actually think that they
do work and now for dinner you guys have
seen me make just on my Instagram and my
snapchat so many times but I wanted to
share from my youtube channel in case
you hadn't seen it yet so basically I've
been buying this lentil pasta from Whole
Foods and it's the best stuff ever
because usually lentil pasta alike from
Trader Joe's the elbows but this is the
angel hair which is so good and it
tastes just like regular pasta but it
has 14 grams of protein per serving and
each third music 200 calories so you
know that I'm like doubling up on that
so basically I make this pasta per usual
and I kneel cup it for about three or
four days and then I add to it because I
want to get some more protein and some
more fiber into my diet I add frozen
peas which you guys already knows also
like my favorite vegetable and just my
favorite thing in general so I have
frozen peas to it and then the best
thing like the thing that makes this so
good is this alfredo sauce and you guys
this is not like sponsored by the
alfredo sauce company but like oh my god
I wish it was because this alfredo sauce
is unreal like I can't even put into
words so it's from Whole Foods it was in
the pasta section and it was like down
on the bottom shelf shelf because you
know it's gonna be like hard to find
because it's also like vegan or organic
but basically it has the most clean
ingredient list ever it's made from
cashews there's no oil added it's
absolutely amazing
it doesn't have a lot of fat but it's
still so nutritionally dense and I'm
obsessed like I can't put it to it
I just need you guys to see oh my
obsession through the camera because I
can't even put it into words I'm just
speechless that I love this stuff so
much if you find it buy it and you need
to let me know what you think of it
because I think it's absolutely like the
best I've ever liked I could just eat
this out of the can like without
anything in it which sounds so gross but
it's not like I would regular alfredo
sauce it's like no but it's vegan you
guys like the entire company is just
vegan almost sucks
so you add up to the pasta and then bone
Appetit you've got dinner
lots of protein and that's literally my
favorite meal ever I sometimes double
this if I'm like working out that day
that's just what I'll like double if I
worked out because I want more protein
so it's so perfect and then I usually
eat dinner a little bit earlier around
exile pop and then I'm full like
literally for the rest of the day and
then at night time what I've been loving
doing is I make some decaf green tea and
I put a cinnamon stick in it and I drink
that before bed usually around like 8
o'clock give this video a thumbs up if
you want to see a night routine because
my night routine lately has been so
awesome like I've been to so like
healthy and like on top of things at
nighttime like I've been getting as much
work done during the night as I usually
do my morning routine so I love that let
me know if you do want to see a night
routine but yeah that is if this video
