to my channel if you're new here my name
is Liv I make new videos every Monday
and Friday feel free to subscribe and
join our family today I'm gonna be
walking you through what I eat in a day
everything that I eat is vegan I try to
eat really plain face I try to eat
really healthy and clean and I'm a
really busy college student so these
meals are gonna be easy budget-friendly
and just good for on-the-go
I made a collective grocery haul about
it we could go and I will link it down
below because a lot of these recipes
will come from that so if you want like
a collective list go and watch that
video today before walking you through
what I'm eating I wanted to give a
little tiny little rant like update
health update I don't know what to call
it
if you don't want to watch this part
feel free to skip ahead to the food I
won't be insulted but for those who are
interested I just wanted to talk
candidly because first of all it feels
so good to be in front of the camera
right now and talking to you guys
because my life has been so crazy lately
I mean I had midterm week so it was
expected but I don't know if you guys
you guys follow me on social media other
places you know that I've had just a lot
of anxiety and a lot of stress with
school starting and that's so normal
like everyone normal I don't like that
it's normal but it's it's kind of a
given when you're in college and a
bachelor's program and I'm sure a lot of
you relate to that and I'm sure that a
lot of you are probably feeling the same
way we're almost to Christmas break you
guys like let's just push through it's
been really stressful for me because I
feel like I've been too busy lately for
my health journey and I think the most
important thing in the world to me is
like staying healthy and like optimizing
the amount of ways that I can be healthy
throughout the day and like having
really good work out from sometimes it's
really frustrating when I can't have the
time to put in a good workout so with
that being said I've switched up my
workout routine lately and I'm actually
vlogging a week of work out to my life
so you guys will be able to see that
next week hopefully on Monday and you'll
be able to see everything that I do in a
week cuz I think that it would give you
kind of like a structure it's not gonna
be detailed workout plans I can do more
videos like that in the future but it's
just gonna be like an outline of like
what I do but because I've been
switching up my workouts lately and I've
been doing different things I haven't
had the same consistency that I'm used
to and so because of that mentally
I've been like Oh like I can't tell if
my body is changing in good ways or bad
ways if I'm putting on muscle or if I'm
putting on fat and it's been really
frustrating and so I wanted to share
with you this one little thing that I
came to the realization of before I show
you the food that I ate tonight so
basically I realized that on my bad days
when I look in the mirror I'm obviously
going to not like what I see like have
you ever had a bad day and then you look
in the mirror and you're like oh it's
okay I look good today
no every time I have a bad day and I
look in the mirror I'm like oh my god
bitch like what your arms are so weak
your acne is back like look at all the
gear size have grown bigger like which I
like are just physical aspects of my
being but it's frustrating because I
know that I wouldn't have to have that
mental state if I wasn't so busy with
school so it's this like constant
tug-of-war between myself but anyways on
those bad days when I look in the mirror
like I don't know why I expect to look
in the mirror and feel better for some
reason but I look in the mirror and
obviously I'm gonna be stressed out with
what I see because I'm already in a
negative state of mind it's like what
you feel you attract so if you're
already in a negative mood and you look
in the mirror like you're just gonna
attract more negativity but on days
where I'm in a good mood like today for
example I was listening to like some
good pumped up music all day getting
ready and I look in the mirror and I was
like oh my god like I finally see like
my abs are coming through and like I'm
getting more tone and definition in my
like glutes that's awesome my skin looks
good like I have a different outlook
because I'm in a positive mindset and a
positive mood so it's all about the law
of attraction we already know this like
what you attract into your life is what
you're going to physically see so when
you attract love into your life you will
see nothing but love and when you
attract negativity into your life
you will see nothing but negativity so I
just want to let you guys know that if
you're having one of those days where
you're feeling down it's just in your
head you're so beautiful and you're such
a divine creature and I never want you
to feel like you are anything less than
the whole beautiful person that you are
sorry to get sappy but I just hate
feeling down and when I feel
I hate that I'm like oh my god there's
other people out there that feel down
and if I get the chance to let you know
that like you are so infinitely
beautiful you literally don't even
comprehend how like magnificent this
life is and how lucky you are to be here
and I want you to know how much I love
you and how much I am rooting for you to
just have better days and to just keep
trying to attract love and positivity
into your life it's so hard and it's not
always gonna be the easiest choice to
make but it's like a muscle it's like
your positive mental state is a muscle
it's your mental muscle that you have to
keep working on the more you make that
choice to be like no stop bad thoughts
literally gets you nowhere just cut it
out get away from the mirror first of
all get away from the mirror go enjoy a
nice smoothie and tell yourself that
you're beautiful because you deserve to
anyways that was a little bit longer of
a rant than I wanted it to be I don't
know if that helped but I hope that it
did I just wanted to say something
because I don't like feeling that way
and I don't like that other people feel
that way and it's just shitty we're all
beautiful and get off your phone stop
comparing yourself to other people
online
they have different genetic structures
than you it's not gonna be the same
thing okay so now we're gonna talk about
what I ate it today okay moving on now
let's talk about what I ate today so I
was really excited to make this video
because first of all it was kind of easy
to film during midterm week so it was
like the perfect like busy girl video to
film but I've been loving this oatmeal
recipe I've been wanting to add more
protein to my diet and I hate the way
protein powders taste
I don't like protein powders they always
upset my stomach unless I have them in
like half a quantity serving size so
what I've been doing lately is I've been
eating my normal overnight Odessa pee by
the way I will never eat anything except
for overnight what's for breakfast like
if I ever show you anything besides
overnight oats for at first I am a lying
that do not take my advice so what I've
been doing is I got this chocolate hemp
protein powder from Trader Joe's and it
genuinely doesn't even have that much
protein in it like a serving size is
four tablespoons which is so much powder
so I only put half
that and so it's literally only adding
four grams of protein but on top of that
the oats have a lot of protein but the
best part about this is of course the
Fox Mount which I have showed you before
you can get it at Whole Foods
out of nowhere else but I love putting
this in this recipe because it adds an
extra eight grams of protein so this is
a really filling breakfast and I then
out of fresh banana in the morning to it
and it tastes so good you could add
peanut butter if you wanted you could
add so many amazing delicious like
strawberries like anything to this and
it'll be so good it's basically
chocolate overnight oats healthy version
it doesn't have a lot of sugar it's just
really good so tonight I recommend not
really filling breakfast especially if
you eat it after a workout so then for
lunch I was so excited to show you guys
my sweet potato wrap recipe because I've
been posting about this everywhere I
showed you the ingredients that I got
for it and it's such a simple recipe to
make so it's not really worth it to even
like show it in a video but I was like
I'm going to anyways so first thing you
need is wraps
I got a Zico wraps and this week I got
small sized ones which was so dumb
because they didn't end up working out
well for me but you just see the you
just see the I'll wrap and then you need
to get a sweet potato and I microwave
this for four minutes with holes in it
and a wet paper towel wrapped around it
and then you need to get some sort of
veggie burger I like to dr. preggers
veggie burgers because they have good
ingredient list and it's not a lot of
oil added to them so I just microwave
those for a minute and then I put it in
the toaster oven for the remainder of
the time at the sweet potatoes in the
microwave for so about five minutes and
then you just spread the sweet potato
because it will be soft it's super easy
you just spread it over the wraps and
then I add a bunch of romaine lettuce
just to give it a crunch and then I put
the burger on top of that the veggie
burger and then I roll it up and you
guys you guys I don't know why whatever
I make a video I always run into
problems with my food but ten out of ten
times in the real world my food comes
out great ten times in a video when I
make food it doesn't like some of my own
J subscribers will remember that time
that I made a peanut butter and jelly
sandwich in a video and I messed it up
like how does one mess up a peanut
butter and jelly sandwich I did I don't
know how but I messes this up too
because I usually just buy the big wraps
and I roll it up and then it's like
Gucci we're good to go amazing but I
bought the little wraps and I rolled it
up and they both broke like
both were too weak to handle my sweet
potatoes so just buy the big wraps don't
buy the little wraps then for a snack
before class I had some green beans I
really really really love fresh cut
green beans just raw with some hummus so
I'm eating this oil-free homicide I got
a whole food I've showed you before that
there is a plant hummus at Trader Joe's
that I also love otherwise how much
tends to have like too much oil and like
salt added to it but I really like these
two hummuses I already threw out the
container for this time I so I'm sorry I
can't like show it's you so I just ate
that and then I had some water and then
also this company called the matcha
reserve was really sweet and they sent
me some matcha and I've always loved
matcha but it's like in my opinion hard
to make but what I do is I fill a mason
jar with the hot water for my Keurig and
then I put the half a teaspoon of matcha
into it and then I put in some on memo
and then I just shake it and it like
literally comes out perfect this tastes
so good like genuinely so so good and
then right after class I was starving
and so big surprise here you guys I
ended up making my favorite meal ever
which is the lentil pasta with my
favorite alfredo sauce and I added some
frozen broccoli that I heated up on the
stove I also got some meal prep it for
the next few days so that's good I'm
actually about to go eat some of that
right now but sorry I didn't have any
new creative like dinner to show you I
mean Lee was excited to show you my
breakfast today because I love it and
then lastly you guys I finally found the
dairy-free halo top at Whole Foods and I
put this on my snapchat story my
Instagram story already but I got two
flavors I got the caramel one and then I
got the oatmeal like cookie one and
they're so good you have to let them
defrost for a few minutes and I
genuinely think they taste so good like
the ingredient list isn't like that
intense like usually dairy free ice
cream ingredient lists are like
paragraphs and it's like a but this one
is like it's a little tiny paragraph
like it's known as that so I really like
them because they're so guilt free like
they literally have like such small
amount of calories in it because I think
it's literally just like flavored frozen
water but they like know what they're
doing when they're marketing but anyway
w5m tweet me a flavor that you bought
and if you liked it because i wanted to
try them all but like i knew i couldn't
do that to myself so i just got two of
them but i want to know how the
so let me know what you guys think of
the other flavors I want you guys to
comment down below something that you
love about yourself today so whether
that's like your sense of humor or your
eyes or your generosity or maybe a
talent that you have that you love about
yourself think of something be selfish
and comment it down below so we can just
fill the comments with so many loving
mantras and affirmations because when
you put it out into the universe the
love comes right back so with that being
said you guys already know I love you
but I want you to know that you should
love yourself too I hope you have an
amazing day give this video a thumbs up
if you did like it and also you can
comment like other video ideas that you
have from me feel free to tweet me or
follow me on Instagram or snapchat and
just we can just talk 24/7 and we can
just be best friends because we're more
the best friends we're a family but I
would see you guys later with it on the
video have a great day thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
