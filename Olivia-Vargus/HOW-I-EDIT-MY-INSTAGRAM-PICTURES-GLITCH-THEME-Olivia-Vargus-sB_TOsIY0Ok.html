channel my name is live if you're new
here and today I'm gonna be showing you
how I edit my Instagram photos this is
probably my most highly requested video
if you didn't know you can go check out
Instagram but I do a glitch feed so
basically all the photos that I post
have a glitch effect to them which is
really cool on my Phoenix I don't know
anyone that really does a full glitch
feed besides me and if you do that I'm
sorry I'm not copying you like I thought
that this was original and it's my
balance I'll add this to my photos
because I just didn't get as an artsy
Flair and kind of just spices up any
photo if you're watching this right now
I dare you to comment a lightning emoji
on my last Instagram picture so also go
before I get into this video I want to
let you guys know that I just got the
iPhone 8 plus which I'm so excited about
because I had the iPhone 6 before and
that thing was stopping with Nancy it
needs to go so I got this on the day
that I came out he said I was like
waiting in line on my snapchat story
like I think I'm getting this phone but
I got it in silver and I picked up a
clear case of I that's prevent case by
but I kind of picked up a clear case and
I like this one just cuz they like it
really protects your phone and I'm super
minimalistic so I like it and then this
is my pops off yet I want to get a grey
one but this is gonna have my old phone
and it's literally as big as my face so
yeah I would really love this phone I
also want to 156 gigabytes which makes
me feel invincible
but I knew I was enough about my iPhone
8 let's get right into the video all
right so I'm gonna record my screen and
I will have it right here for you guys
alright so this is what the inside of my
phone looks like so I have everything
organized into different folders and
this is the folder that I used for
Instagram so it has my photo sacks
darkroom which is what I used to add it
glitch or gleesh I don't even know how
to say it but that's what I'm gonna use
to edit the photo visco and then
facetune and then I don't know what
clips is so all that is facing for is
just to whiten my photos I'm not really
about the whole like editing your body
in your face like trend just embrace who
you are and then visco I used to always
I used a sticks mainly on visco and then
I switched into this new app called
dark brown the dark room is basically
just another regular editing app but I
like this one filter that they have so
let's just choose this photo which I've
already edited and I'll put it back to
original so this is what the photo looks
like and then when you add the filter it
instantly just creates like a really
bright and really vibrant composure and
it's a really similar to see one on
visco so if you don't have sour cream
you don't download it I would try that
but what I like about a 100 it's the
first filter on this app it's the only
one that I've ever used this out I
bought all the other ones I'm like I
don't use them I got just use this one
free filter that it came with but
basically you can adjust it how you want
it and I usually keep it around there
but look at how clear makes my skin this
is livin how a catfish on Instagram like
look at the first photo and then look at
this one like it's just so much more
vibrant it adds a lot of saturation it
adds a lot of sharpness to the photo
automatically so it's like all of my
work is done I just do that and then
it's like good it's good to go
so I will export that to my camera roll
pretty simple that's for a couple other
photos you guys can see what it looks
like on a variety of images I also
really liked this photo um let's see
that's the original photo and that's
what it looks like with the Edit so I'll
export that to another good photo that I
like so this is it without the edit and
then that's with the Edit so I will save
that one too
so now I will show you guys how I add
the glitter to my photos which is what
you all been waiting for
so you open like I think Hood cliche I
don't know but you open that up so right
away when you open that up this is the
screen that you're gonna look at choose
the one in the middle which is the photo
editor and it takes a minute open but
see here's I've already been like
editing and messing with photos for a
while like I have an entire camera roll
of photos right now follow me needs to
get when you want to see the specs so if
you want to so I will show you how I
edit let's see this person right here I
think was a good
right when you open it it will start
doing this and you're gonna think that
your phone is broken you're gonna Vic
what's up what the heck this is why in
this opera so confusing for so many of
you and you guys are like Olivia like
did you just break our phone no just go
to channels which is the third one right
here say it's highlighted in green and
this is what I use right next to it is
something called scan which I also think
it's cool you can kind of like mess with
the photo like that which if you don't
want to the glitch feed one of you could
do this because this is kind of cool too
as I feel like if I had all my photos
with this on it but anyway so what I use
channels this app has so much stuff on
them if you get people to pay for this
app but it's so worth it because there's
so much stuff on it I am so scared of
all the other things in this app I just
use channels so basically how channel's
works is you move your finger like drag
if we go across the street from left to
right so move your finger from left to
right across the photo and you will see
that it makes a vertical edit on the
photo and if you move your finger from
the top to the bottom it will create a
horizontal effect on the photo so this
is where you have to kind of you know
make your own choice of which you want
to use on the photo so for this one I
would use vertical and I think it looks
kind of cool over here but I also kind
of like it over here like it kind of
just I had like a fun like the layer to
the photo so once you want like find
where you want it just let it go and it
will like slowly bounce back up until I
get some original form and so you just
kind of wait for it to stock where you
want it to so I kind of want it to be a
lot so I'll drop it down and then I'm
taking my finger off the screen and then
I'm pressing the upper right corner next
and that just stops it where it was and
then you hit next again and then just
save it to the camera roll it's kind of
complicated I'm not gonna lie like it
took me way too long if you're gonna zap
out and so I'm hoping that you guys just
kind of play around with it and you get
the hang of it but I'll show you it
again so let's go to another photo so
let's take this one that I have and so
I'll just go to channels and then I'll
drag it and I think I want to over in
this left corner again so I will let it
go
and then hit next next save and I'll
show you one that's horizontal too and
I'll go to this photo and so for this
one I'll create much more of a subtle
glitch effect because I don't think that
it would look good if I like messed up
my face so I'll do this for like selfies
and more of up-close pictures but kind
of bring it to where you want it to be
and then take your finger off the screen
and let it slowly drift back into place
and then once it's kind of where you
want it to be hit next right away and
now there's a really subtle glitch
effect added to it and so then once you
have it where you want it to save the
photo and then that's it though now
these are photos in our camera roll and
this is kind of like the before and
after obviously like you don't have to
do this to your photos if you just want
to use like I don't remember if you want
to add glitch like mess if it how you
want it and like make it your own
okay so like I said in the beginning
after I'm not posting this video I'm
gonna post a new Instagram and I told
you guys to comment a lighting emoji on
my picture that I post but if you made
it this far into the video that I want
you to comment not really a light emoji
but comment your favorite animal next to
the emoji and I will be following back a
few of you just to share my love with
you guys also I obviously don't have the
glitch effect trademarks but if you do
use this in your photos please tag me in
it because I want to see your edit and I
want to see your beautiful face and so
make sure you definitely knew good
photos we should have like a hashtag
like hashtag glitch for Vargas oh my god
no if you use that I will follow you
like that's just fun I mean give this
video a thumbs up if you like my glitch
feed and comment down below what filters
that you use because I am kind of
looking for some new recommendations I'm
kind of trying to decide if I wanna
switch like a fall as warm theme um but
that is it for today's video guys thank
you so much for watching you guys are so
off to make sure that you follow me on
instagram if you want to see more of my
Twitter feed and if you want to you can
