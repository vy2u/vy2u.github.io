subscribers my mind is blown thank you
so much to every single one of you that
it subscribes me I can't even put into
words how grateful I am
it's how happy that this all makes me
and I think that you guys are some of
the kindest most amazing beautiful souls
that I've ever had like the pleasure to
like interact with and talk with in my
life and I'm so thankful that you have
found my channel and that you all exist
thank you so much for just supporting me
and your kindness
I just love you guys so much and I'm at
a loss for words reading all of your
messages that you guys sent me first of
all you guys are so beautiful and
amazing and second of all like thank you
for your support so I thought in honor
of my 100,000 subscriber mark I wanted
to kind of talk about why I started on
YouTube and where I want to go and
YouTube and just my whole journey in
general so we're gonna do that today and
hopefully you can find out a little bit
more about me and the Creator that you
have decided to subscribe to right now
in my life where I see myself as I I'm
currently laying the foundation for what
I want my YouTube channel to be I think
that the past few months I was kind of
like prepping it you know I mean like
putting some primer on my channel and
now I'm laying the foundation for things
like I got a new camera
I got Final Cut Pro like things are
starting to like get into place but the
next bitch we're gonna learn to contour
this channel we are going to highlight
this channel like all this ones are like
we are going to make this channel like
me and you I say that because like I
can't do this without you but hopefully
this channel will have an amazing impact
and positive impact on more and more
people and I hope to continue to grow
that's the goal this is my dream job my
dream life and I'm so grateful that like
it's coming true like this is what hard
where it gets you this is about
manifestation and the law of attraction
like actually gets it this is a result
of all of it so I started doing YouTube
I started a channel in high school but I
didn't start posting and so I got to
college because I was too embarrassed to
in high school I thought everyone's
gonna make fun of me and it's probably
right because like a lot of like I did
when I first
which like I mean look where I am now it
doesn't matter at all what a hater site
I growin up I had a lot of friends I had
a good social life but I was always such
a weird outcast person and I know that
sounds so cliche like I was an outcast
like no way I'm still am an outcast and
I found my place on YouTube and online
and I just was in love with creators I
considered a lot of creators as well as
growing up I can throw a lot of creators
my Big Sisters because I never really
had anybody teach me how to do my makeup
or teach me how to talk to boys or give
me high school advice so a lot of
content creators were literally like my
big sisters because of such a naturally
emotional person and I literally am the
most like talkative person ever when I
started to grow up and like kind of
become an adult myself and go to college
I decided like I wanted to make a
channel too because I wanted the
opportunity to be a big sister
through the younger girls and boys in
the next generation that I got to how
when I was growing up I wanted to be
their new big sister so that's why I
decided to start my channel in order to
do I wanted to make a positive impact on
the new generation and just anything
that I could possibly think of and I
wasn't really sure when I started my
channel like what's the main topic would
be what kind of youtuber outta be so I
would have some vlogs some cooking
videos some like weird funny challenges
and a lot of those videos are gone by
now like you can't find them because
it's like it doesn't really matter
anymore I've been on my channel and also
I got rid of them but it was just I was
just getting comfortable making content
and I was getting comfortable with like
what I wanted my content zippy and who I
wanted my voice to be online and you
know life happens in my life like it
like a normal person like I grew and I
changed over the course of like the two
years that I'd started my channel and I
started to find my voice and things that
matter to me
you know I became vegan I started to
lose weight and those were two very
prominent things in my life and still
are so that was something that I put on
my channel and because it was so
authentic I think that's why I've got so
many like views and so many and so many
people relating to it so I'm so happy
that you know I went through that in
order to like come out stronger and
learn from it and then talk to others
about it so just know like everything in
life happens for a reason but back on
topic so yeah I mean that's why I
started my channel is to literally be an
older sister for other people you guys
inspire me just
as much as you say that I inspire you so
like I'm so like thankful that you guys
like reach out to me and message me and
like I want to like take the time every
day to like go do it just like thank
every single one of you for just being
alive and just being so amazing okay so
now I want to answer some things that
people frequently ask me one of the
questions that I get asked a lot is what
equipment do I use I will leave down
below in my description what equipment
that I use and it'll all be like Amazon
links that you can go through a lot of
people ask me how I got confident and
like comfortable posting videos and I
was never always like this confident
like comfortable posting and talking in
front of a video alone I will insert a
clip right now one of my first ever
videos that I've recorded never got
posted anywhere but it's so cute so I'm
gonna insert a great here
I think it's like literally the craziest
cringes video ever and it's so funny to
watch I was probably 15 in that video I
don't even know but it was so like I do
you remember recording it but I found it
on an old flash car like a week ago so
you could say the glow of this real
there's hope for every one you got it's
like I'm not kidding how did I grow my
youtube channel I think really really
like really manifesting it like I worked
so hard and I still work really hard at
this and I still want to grow my channel
and this is just the beginning like I
said I think really putting aside your
time and scheduling it in your life like
a job like I put an actual job for this
like I really like balanced it with
school I gave up on a lot of my social
life I remember stalking my friend like
a week ago announcing like last year and
how do we make my friends would come
over to my place and pregame and then
leave and go out to a party for
Halloween weekend like all four nights
that like the weekend was going home for
and I stayed home because I was a guy
got at an upload and that's how I've
been for like two years straight I've
been like I got a head it up a little
bit it's literally that I'm so dedicated
to this that it's not even like it's
secondhand to me so it's like not even
an issue but I just want to say like if
you want this like you have to dedicate
yourself to it like you're it's not just
gonna come like if you posed once or
twice like you have to like really
really like work hard for this it's hard
work to like do this entire thing by
yourself like you're doing everything
like you're filming you're editing
you're uploading your marketing like all
of it is you so like you really need to
be on top of it not to scare you but
like that's the truth another things on
the ask question that I get is do you
have any advice people who want to start
or grow a channel you need to completely
embrace it because you're never gonna
like see results if you're like
half-assing it
so what embrace it and then also have a
reason like don't just do it because you
want subscribers and you want popularity
and you want people to think you're cool
do because you have a purpose it's like
what if you want this to be your career
like what what are you giving to the
world on when you make videos that's
gonna make them like support you and
want to like make you a creator give it
a purpose like if you're really good at
cooking like make cooking videos if
you're really good at like being funny
and entertaining like you do that like
do it and do it at your best of
abilities and don't compare yourself to
others like just go for it and like
you will find your own voice and it will
take time it doesn't happen overnight
for most people but like just keep going
and then the last thing that I want
answers where do I see myself in five
years and I have not a damn clue at all
I don't even know where I've seen myself
in five minutes like I'm hoping that I
have a food in my hands because I'm
pretty hungry right now but honestly I
just want to continue to thrive and
continue to grow and prosper and be
positive and I would love for you guys
to join me on this so thank you again if
I haven't done that enough thank you and
I love you guys so much and this is so
amazing to me like I hope that I'm
putting this into words as well as I
want to but follow me on Instagram and
Twitter and snapchat if you want to
catch up with more of my life and see
more what I'm doing my life is about to
get so much more interesting like I said
we were just laying the foundation but
we're about to learn to contour bitches
