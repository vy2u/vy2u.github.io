my channel my name is Liv if you're new
here and today I want to walk you
through what my workout routine is when
I'm in a rush this routine is really
perfect for if you're a student and you
don't have a lot of time or if you're
just like out there in the world working
and being a boss this is perfect for you
too I want to emphasize that it is so
awesome that you're choosing to work out
but please don't feel like you have to
work out every day and do not feel like
if you miss a day at the gym that the
world is ending I went through a lot of
struggles with getting like comfortable
with days and I would skip the gym I
felt a lot of guilt for a while and so I
want you guys to know that it is ok to
miss a day at the gym especially if
you're busy being a boxer doing other
things you need rest days like come on
you need to be easier on yourself but
for real it is possible to get it to go
to the gym so please make sure that
you're getting some rest days and that
you're giving yourself like passes here
and there when you wake up and you don't
have energy like it's ok
as long as you're still like being
healthy throughout the day it's fine so
do not worry about it one bit heck I was
gone for two weeks on vacation and I
didn't work out once and I ate so bad
and I came back and my body bounced back
so it's definitely a learning process
but you will be ok if you miss the dream
that promise you you have a long life
ahead of you hopefully so missing the
gym once or twice a week or two weeks or
even if you've never been before and you
are regretting it and you're feeling
guilt about it it's okay because you
still have another whole thing like I
don't know 80 years or whatever to go on
this planet to go to the gym and to be
fit you will make your goals happen you
have all the time in the world and
there's nothing to worry about so now I
want to walk you guys through what I do
on days that I really don't have a lot
of time and I have too much fun on my
schedule and I just want to still get a
quick workout in so I can feel like good
and energized throughout the day this
workout has been so perfect for me
lately and it's about 30 minutes
downstairs on my treadmill and then when
I'm done if I do have more time and I
want to add stuff I do some more work
upstairs it's like with distance bands
and so like that give this video a
thumbs up you want to see more of those
videos I'm still perfecting my route
for that stuff so it's not ready for a
video yet but someday it might be
somewhat need help so yeah I just wanna
walk us through this I've really been
loving this for working my lower body
and for also giving me like a good sweat
some things I want you to keep in mind
when doing this breakup is to a keep yo
abs something the whole time and I mean
like your whole apps not just your lower
abs just your upper loves you can just
suck your stomach in like squeeze your
ab muscles for your entire abdomen and
you will feel so much of a burn during
this workout and then I want you to make
sure that you're squeezing your glute
muscles while you're doing this workout
but please make sure that when you're
squeezing your glute muscles you're not
arching your back because I used to do
that and then I found out that that's
like not good for your back and your
spines your neck issues in the future so
make sure you're kicking your back up
straight in good posture and your
squeeze your glute muscles even if you
don't look as cute because you're like
squeezing your glutes and everything
they're tight like you'll you'll thank
me later
let's just walk does this work out so
the first thing that I do is I just get
on the treadmill and I walk for 10
minutes and this is so good because a
lot of times I have just woken up and I
need to check my phone for things so I
use this as kind of like a motivator to
get to the gym because I'm like if I get
to the gym I have those first 10 minutes
where things aren't as hard just yet and
I can check my notifications so that's
what kind of like motivates me to get to
the gym on some mornings so once you're
there you want to walk on the full
incline that a treadmill can go to and I
usually walk on speed three every Trevor
looks different so my triple goes to
incline 15 seven go to ten some might
not even incline it off in which case
it's workouts not gonna work for you I'm
sorry but if you can get it to incline
and you can go out like a nice walking
pace and you want to make sure that
while you're doing this like squeeze
your abs and squeeze your glute muscles
you're gonna do this for 10 minutes and
you'll get your body warmed up you're
starting to feel a little like hot and
like sweaty and that's good that's what
you want that's what we're doing this
and so then I like to mix things up so I
your own risk do this at a really slow
speed to get used to it first cuz I
don't want any of you falling off the
treadmill like I did the first time but
we're gonna turn around on the
treadmills and we're gonna walk
backwards for five minutes at a little
bit of a lower speed but we're still
gonna keep the high incline and I'm
gonna walk backwards in this
really good for your glute muscles and
your thigh muscles if you bend into more
of a squat position while doing this you
will feel this so much in your leg
sometimes I literally don't think I'm
gonna make it at the five minutes and I
have to turn back around but just power
through it and you will feel this
tomorrow morning I swear when you're
walking backwards and you're like
squatting and the incline is up and
you're sweating and it's been 15 minutes
you look so good and then I turn back
around and for these five minutes you
can either just continue doing like
walking or if you want to like I do I
like to try and do some lunges even if
they're just like hello like not super
intense lunges like I like to really
engage my muscles and that's why I like
this workout is because it it kind of
it's a cardio workout but you're working
a lot of your muscle groups too while
also waking up and kind of like getting
your muscles like ready for the day so I
do that for five minutes and then I turn
back around and I do another five
minutes going backwards and then for the
last five minutes I've been loving going
side to side so I keep the incline but I
don't go up as high usually lower the
incline that I have my treadmill at so
like five or ten and I walk on a really
slow speed going sideways and I do
sideways like squat lunge things and I
do that for two and half minutes on each
side and then that's pretty much the
workout and then you stretch out the
words drink lots of water and eat lots
of protein 13 minutes after your workout
and you want to see what I'm eating and
a video to see that where I get my
nutrition from please give this video a
thumbs up I would love to make that soon
I love food videos that love food the
best thing about this workout is that
it's really easy to adjust it to your
like skill level so if you're beginner
you don't have to have the incline up
too high don't walk too fast if you're
more advanced I feel free doing amp dot
up add some weights to your engels I
have some dumbbells in your hands like
do whatever you want to do but I love
this workout because I can really like
adjust as how I'm doing that day and I
really feel like every day that I do it
I really feel like my leg muscles get
stronger and then it when I
I'm like I said I come back upstairs and
I do more reps of other things or I'll
be some equipment downstairs and do some
reps but yeah that's come on as my
pretty girl workout routine and it's how
I've been staying fit throughout like my
busy schedule this summer because I
haven't really have as much time to
dedicate to fitness to summarize I did
before the summer started which was
still weird to me because I thought that
the summer would have like a lot of free
time but it did it if you need workout
motivation or inspiration I post a lot
of stuff on my Twitter all the time and
I post a lot of stuff on my Instagram
stories and my snapchat stories so feel
free to add me out all of that if you
want to subscribe to my channel you're
completely welcome to I'm not going to
stop you from doing that so thank you
for watching and I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
