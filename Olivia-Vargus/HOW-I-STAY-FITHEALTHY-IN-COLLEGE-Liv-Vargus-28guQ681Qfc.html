channel if you're new here my name is
Liv I make new videos every Monday and
Friday it's a good time for you
subscribe and join our family in today's
video I'm going to give you tips on how
to stay healthy in school so this videos
gonna be perfect for anyone who is a
student whether you're a high school
student or a college student or you just
a busy person in general and you don't
feel like you have time to make your
life healthy like you want it to be
these are gonna be my tips for you
being in my third year of college I
think I finally mastered how to be
healthy while in college because for the
first two years I was not that great but
we've learned and we've learned a lot
and that's what I'm gonna be sharing
today I'm also so excited to say thank
you to audible for teaming up with me
and sponsoring me for this video
I'm working with Tom for their new
hashtag new year new me campaign to help
you achieve all of your goals in 2018
I've already been hearing a lot of
people give up one of their goals and
saying oh well I already failed and it
is not too late to get back on the
bandwagon you guys it's just because
it's the first month of the year
sometimes this is just the trial run and
February is where it's really odd so I
decided to set my own goals for this
year so my goal is going to be to one
stop stress eating so much because
that's my biggest failure when it comes
to having a healthy lifestyle I get
stressed and then I turn to food so my
goal is to stop that to stop and break
that habit also stress really ruins my
fitness routine because it makes me just
lazy or unmotivated to go so the key
here is drugs and our students I'm sure
most of us can relate to that completely
double you don't already know about
audible I will tell you about it so
audible has the largest selection of
audiobooks that you can listen to
audible helps you listen to more books
and lets you switch seamlessly between
devices that you're using so you can
pick off right where you left off so
whether it is on your phone or in your
car or on the tablet or through Amazon
echo you can get and listen to tons of
books literally hands and even
eyes free because you don't have to even
look at anything and you can do
literally anything
listening to your bug so honorable
members get a credit every month good
for any audiobook you on used credits
roll over until the next month so if you
didn't like your audiobook you can just
exchange it no questions asked
plus your books are yours to keep so you
can go back and listen to them anytime
you want
and even after you cancel your
membership your books are still yours so
I wanted to show you the three books
that I am listening to right now the
first one is called seven Habits of
Highly Effective People by Stephen Covey
and this one is absolutely amazing I
have been obsessed with listening to
this book it has given me so much
insight on why we do what we do and just
the psychology behind people who are
reactive versus proactive and I highly
recommend it the next book is called why
you eat what you eat by Rachael Hertz
and I really just want to learn more
about nutrition and the psychology
behind a lot of our eating habits
because I think that's a huge part of
being healthy is just your mind it's it
all starts up here so and is there an
audio book that I must sing - it's
called almost as only my Arjun Rose
because I love Ireland rose and I wanted
to listen to this book for forever so
I'm so excited to finally be listening
to it she coincidentally it was the
first person who got me to try audible
so it's kind of like a full circle and
if you use the link to my description
you can get a free 30 day trial on
wakhan so with all that being said I
want to actually talk to you about why I
believe that this is the best first tip
to start off with in this video because
I've been thinking a lot lately about
how I consume my content and the amount
of time that I spend - the consuming
content when I could be educating myself
and sometimes there's this like
roadblock where I would rather be
educating myself but I don't know how to
do it in a way that isn't boring
sometimes I feel like reading a book it
still takes too much effort out of me
and I think that there's just kind of
this shift in the generation where we
have such short attention spans that we
can't look at something for too long
where I personally can't sit still for
too long so being able to listen to an
audiobook while I still do chores and I
still get things done has been the best
habit that I've gone into I just find it
way more stimulating and it's such a
better use of my time because I rarely
have free time and when I do I just want
to shut my mind
and just rest but when you get to
actually educate yourself and you get to
listen to things that are actually
helping you work towards your goals if
I'm listening to a book about nutrition
I'm listening to a book about how to be
a better person and be more effective in
your life and I'm also listening to just
a funny uplifting book about how to be
an adult like I'm a genuinely saying
this right now I really think that it's
a better use of your time in your free
time to start a consuming content that's
actually gonna help you so yeah because
you don't we're sitting in classrooms
all day in our minds are numb and they
just turn to mush at the end of the
dance it's just been the best way to
like relax and still feel like I'm free
I don't have to stare at a screen I
don't have to kind of I don't have to
keep my eyes fixated on something for a
while I can get up and make dinner and
listen to an audio book and say I really
just mean that from the bottom of my
heart but let's get on to the next step
so I just want to jump right into how to
talk with nutrition in the best way
possible while you're a student this
seems to be the seventh biggest struggle
for everyone I think the first thing a
struggle is working out but here is the
plain and simple answer to how to eat
better as a student meal prepping and I
know that that sounds so cliche you're
so boring but let me ask you are you
doing it yet like I know you know
because I told you I know you know how
to me oh crap I know you know recipes
you know so why aren't you doing it yet
and I know as students that we are so to
divide late night snacking and partying
and having caffeine and sugary drinks
and just sugary foods in general to just
keep us alert to give us energy so I've
know that there's a lot of temptation
but when you meal prep you're actually
planning your meals duh you're planning
what you're gonna eat so you're not
thrown off are surprised by something
you're not thrown off by your hunger and
you're like oh I suddenly need food
right now and say you knew what you're
gonna have for lunch that day and you
knew what time you were gonna eat it at
and then you went in hot instead of
being like oh my god I frantically last
minute I'm so starving and I need
I'm gonna eat the worst thing that I can
as quick as I can so meal prepping it
does not need to take a long amount of
time
I'm your prep for three days in a ten
minutes because I'm just good at it it
doesn't need to be like a three hour
long thing it doesn't just need to be
chicken and broccoli like you can make
it exciting respond vegan so I wouldn't
eat the chicken but you can make it
exciting because if you make it boring
you're not gonna want it you're gonna
make I just would rather eat anything
about that your milk up food can be just
as good as regular food you just have it
prepped for you and you have it measure
it so you know you're not overeating
your serving size and its portion out a
box of cereal when you first buy it so
you know what you're eating of that day
a portion out things drop all your
coping is it's portioning your food
throughout the week so it even saves you
money too and the other benefit that's
really worth mentioning about meal
prepping is that it also puts you on a
habit of an eating schedule so you know
you're eating a breakfast of lunch and
dinner otherwise a lot of us would just
be like snap snap meal stat snap meal
and at the end of the day you just feel
like you eat all this crap and you just
were eating constantly throughout the
day and when you meal prep you have
breakfast you have a lunch and your
dinner and you have snacks in between
and it's just a lot better structure
it's a lot better habit for your
metabolism to the end and if you don't
want a meal prep every single day of the
week
I think the weekends off on Sundays I
usually go for true shopping do food so
I'm just eating whatever I have left
over and then on Saturdays I always take
a cheat day so I just go out and have
fun and carefree and I swear by this you
guys knowing what you're eating when you
wake up in the morning for the rest of
the day it's a good feeling
let's try it please my next tip its
water consumption cuz I know you guys
are not listening to me when I say this
you need to be drinking minimum 2 liters
of water a day
no and ifs or buts about it I don't want
to hear oh you know I throw my water
bottle a couple times
no no measure look at your once's okay
learn learn how to look at your answers
and translate them the leaders drink two
liters of water a day and here's why I
know you guys aren't drinking water
because this is what I hear from you
oh my god is that such a false myth okay
I should really make a veil on like myth
versus facts of health tips but when you
drink a lot of water it does not make
you pee more frequently it means that
when you go pee with a normal amount of
times per day
you're just peeing more in that one
sitting like for a longer amount of time
so it takes five extra seconds and your
piece tree will be clearer because
you're gonna have healthy internal
organs if your pee is yellow this is so
much like pee talk I'm sorry I was gonna
do this quickly but if you pee is yellow
then you are not drinking enough water
so please for the love of God
drink water here's a rule of thumb drink
one glass of water before every meal one
glass of water during every meal and one
lots of water after every meal okay can
you do that for me just do that every
day and tell me how you're feeling at
the end of the week okay my next tip is
going to finally be about exercise a lot
of people are saying that they don't
have enough time to exercise or they
know what the motivation to exercise I
think it's it's more confidence than
motivation I don't think a lot of you
are confident to go to the gym and I
feel you because when I first started
going to gym I thought everyone was
looking at me I was so out of shape I
would walk on the treadmill and I'd be
like people are probably driving some
walking but you just have to suck it up
because there is for the most part just
mind your own business when you go to
the gym and second of all my burrito
when I first started working outside if
people are judging at the gym that's
their own problem first of all and then
in a couple months they're gonna see how
good you look and how fit you got and
they're gonna wish they had never
damaged you in the first place
and you're going there for yourself
you're going in for you so who cares not
anyone on this thing but I really want
to give you guys this tip because this
is what I have always found has been the
most beneficial way to motivate you go
to the gym if you are not motivated go
in a group convinced at least one other
person to make this commitment with you
to start going to the gym in a certain
time that you can agree upon and just go
for you know 30 minutes go for an hour
but I will never bail on a group workout
and my roommate keeps me pretty
accountable because she loves to the gym
a lot too and we don't always go
together but when we do I will never
on plans to go to the gym because I
don't want to be weak I don't want her
to look down upon me and when you go
with a friend it's so much more fun
because then you can walk around
together you could talk together you
feel more confident in a group I think
there's a lot more comfort when it comes
like the social aspect upon nieuwegein
because it can be kind of scary for a
lot of us and if you have access to
places that do cycling classes or
hip-hop classes start going to those and
just work out like four times a week you
don't have to go every day I make
Fitness a huge part of my life by
blocking out an hour and a half almost
five or six days of a week and that's
because that's just a huge part of my
life I'm dedicated to that it's my hobby
so you if you just want to be like a
normal reasonable person who just goes
like three or four times do that it's
and just go for thirty minutes just get
something done and it's it's not about
what you look like when you go to the
gym it's not about what you're gonna
look like after you go it's about how
you feel it's about having good internal
like cardiovascular system in good
working or in sand respiratory systems
and functioning body parts it's about
having strength and having just good
health that's what it should really
under the Avena so don't think about
boarding the gym as oh I have to do this
around you know I'm not gonna fit into
the next size down of games that I want
to fit into think of it as I have to do
this because I want to live to be 80
years old or something like that you
know and the last thing that I wanna say
to motivate you to vote of the drib is
there's no difference between you and me
or anyone else you go to the gym there's
no difference between you and the person
who's actually out there doing what you
want to do the only difference is their
mindset and their choice to be proactive
about it if you have classes at 8:00
a.m. every day and you don't come home
until 7 p.m. every day and you feel like
you don't have time to the gym that's
your choice that you just made or you
can make the choice to be like okay I
recognize that this is my schedule I
recognize that I can't control that and
that is something that just is I have to
work around that so be proactive and
think I can wake up 30 minutes earlier
every morning and just do a quick 10
minute jog in 20 minutes of like an ab
workout or something
every morning and I don't even get
sweaty from it I can just do that to the
quick body shower and get to school it's
called being proactive and recognizing
that you have a choice to make in life
with every situation that you're given
and you can make that choice and there's
many other people out there making that
choice so why can't you do it
so my next tip is something that you
guys probably attempted before and then
you fail and you never do it again
and you forget about it but I need you
to start setting alarms at like 10
o'clock to remind yourself to go to bed
because if you don't sometimes I look at
my phone and it's midnight and I'm like
oh my god I have to get up at 6:00
tomorrow and why did I do this to myself
and half the time it's because I'm just
mindlessly on my phone and the biggest
downside to not getting enough sleep at
night is that the next day you need to
overload on caffeine and sugar in order
to stay alert I think we all have way
too much FOMO and we're just scared to
put our phones down like it's kind of
stupid but if you just put get in the
habit of knowing that it's routine and
I'm 10 p.m. every night you put your
phone down then it will be a routine
like I said so you'll just expect it so
at nine o'clock you start to think about
it and you're like okay I've been more
and more hour to you know my phone if I
want to be in the last if I'm gonna give
you I actually learned in school and
this is called making SMART goals which
is an acronym so it stands for a
specific measurable achievable relevant
and time-bound so for an example a SMART
goal could be by June 1st 2018 I want to
run a 7-minute mile that's a SMART goals
because they had timeframe it was
reasonable it can be measured you know
can you actually do that so and the
secret to achieving a goal is that when
you wake up in the morning it you're not
thinking I'm doing the 7-minute mile
you're thinking what can I do today to
achieve my goal so you break it down
into smaller steps you break it down
into smaller more bite-sized things that
you can actually achieve that day so it
would be running ten seconds faster that
day it would be actually going to the
gym that day it would be fueling your
body and drinking water that day so just
breaking it down into smarter girl goal
it's every day that are achievable and
then eventually they will add up and a
mountain to our bigger goals and I say
that all the time your small goal your
small daily ones are what
your big big ones give this video a big
