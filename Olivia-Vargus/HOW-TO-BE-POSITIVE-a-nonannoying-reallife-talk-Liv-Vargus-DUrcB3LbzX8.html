to my channel if you're new here my name
is Liv I make new videos every Monday
and Friday it's a good time feel free to
subscribe and join our family today I'm
joined with an empty cup of coffee
because I don't trust myself to actually
hold a regular cup of coffee I will
spill it on myself but the concept of
this is like coffee talks so instead of
a cup of coffee I have a coffee candle
burning so there's still a coffee
atmosphere so none of you could have
talked me on that I've never filmed over
here before but I think if I got like
some plants right here it could be like
a cute new set of course I wish these
walls are white or gray or anything
other than this poop yellow but we're
not gonna go there today so while I
metaphorically hold this cup of coffee
and have a little chitchat with you guys
feel free to grab a cup of coffee or
anything else yourself and just relax
and just enjoy the little rant that
we're gonna go on so I was motivated to
make this video because I had a little
bit of a Down week last week and I felt
like instead of hiding that from the
camera and from my platforms that I'd
rather just address it because I think
that's a lot more helpful because I want
you guys to always know I'm not perfect
and we're gonna get into it but
basically we're gonna talk about how I
stay positive all the time question
question I know this video is such a
change of pace from my last video and I
love making fun videos and I love making
like things out like I know are popular
and trending in YouTube but I also I'd
rather have a little bit more
authenticity to my channel at honestly
because that's who I want to be my
channel in my opinion is not for me it's
for empowering other people through my
own story so through my life but by
empowering people in those ways so every
once in a while I'll just be like going
about my day and then all of a sudden
I'll have this like brain surge or like
epiphany basically and I always have to
write down and then after I write down I
always forget it like I just like write
down and then just like it's like
cleared out of my head I don't know it's
I need a better way of doing things
because I would rather it stay in my
head but I always write things down use
your on my phone notes or on my laptop
and so I've done this before but I read
from my phone like what I wrote down and
I'm going to
do that again because I wrote down a lot
and not enough for me to memorize and
recite back to and it's just more
authentic when I read it so we're just
gonna go on a little journey of a rant
of my brain thump that I had this
morning so I have my laptop and I'm just
gonna kind of like go through it so I
wrote all this down and then above it I
wrote concept coffee talks how I stay
positive all the time okay so as I said
I had a rough week last week and it
happens it's so normal and because I
have someone if you follow me and you
see me as such like a positive like
bright person which I aspire to be all
the time I want you guys to know that
that's not the reality 24/7 and I want
you to look up to like a real person not
only 25% of a person that shows yourself
online like if you guys you guys could
just see my ups and my downs because
that's what it's going to be the most
authentic for me to share and I think
the most helpful so what I wrote that I
want to share is that sometimes when you
have those negative days or weeks or
spans of time you need to let that
negativity flow through you and be okay
with it and and be like okay I
acknowledge this now what am I gonna do
to learn from this and it's okay if you
don't have an immediate response
sometimes you just gotta wait and you're
just gonna marinate in that you got
to marinate in your sorrows and your
sadness and that's okay like take as
long with time as you need because
sometimes the best way through the storm
is literally just like head on through a
storm like just embrace it like soak it
up whatever you're going through just
completely completely like accept it
because if you try and reject it you try
and tell yourself you shouldn't be
feeling this way try and force yourself
to feel better it's not gonna happen so
you need to completely let it consume
you which can suck like it can suck and
when I'm down when I'm in those down
moments sometimes I don't want to get
back up sometimes I just want to sit
there and just stay there and I'm just
like okay this is just I just needed to
be like this for a while and sometimes
it lasts 15 minutes and then I'm like
I'm good sometimes it lasts a few days
sometimes it lasts a whole week like it
lasted a whole week for me and I was
like oh my god like I just don't want to
get better right now like I'm not ready
yet like I feel like I still have issues
to work through
and that's when you need to accept it
like that's what I'm saying you need to
accept like this is how I'm feeling
right now now what can I do to learn and
grow from this and then I was in a work
the other day and I was working on my
arm muscles with you guys know I say
it's like my weakest muscles and they've
been getting stronger lady like I can
actually do push-ups now and that's like
completely mind-blowing I actually like
finish a workout the other day and I
looked at myself in the mirror and I was
like holy should do like I just did a
push-up such a good feeling ten out of
ten like I felt so proud of myself and
accomplished but while I was doing those
arm workouts that day I was thinking
about the mind muscle connection and how
the goal is to grow a muscle and to do
that you have to literally tear the
muscle apart so when you grow a muscle
you're like straining it so hard that it
tears and then the goal is to like eat
protein and nurture the muscle and it
will like repair itself but bigger and
stronger so that's how a muscle grows
and while I was doing my arm workout and
I was like dying because I could not put
my arms and they were like shaking and I
was like it'll all be worth it and it is
gonna be worth it I also had this
epiphany that like this is kind of what
life is like too sometimes you need to
break yourself down in order to grow
back stronger and that's like with age
you get wisdom because more happens
to you it's inevitable that shit's just
gonna happen to you that's life you
can't control what happens you can only
control your reaction but you can
control the reaction in a way to make it
so that it can be positive and can help
you grow and get stronger so that's what
I wanted to share is that you you might
go through ship but it's gonna serve a
purpose later on to help you get
stronger and I think about all the
things that I've been through in life
you know heartbreaks and losses and
insecurities and when I was like feeling
so left out in high school and all these
little things that I had gone through in
life that I felt like where they end all
be on out have those days or outs down
and I was like I don't want to get back
up I would eventually get back up at
some point and I'd be like okay we're
gonna get better we're gonna make things
better things are gonna be fine and I am
Who I am today because of those moments
where I bought back up I am Who I am
today because of those moments where I
was down like your path you encompass
like what you go through so don't expect
to be perfect all the time I know
sometimes when we're like up high and
we're feeling great and we're having a
great day and we feel like how we have
everything figured out more like great
things are gonna be I have my leg
figured out everything's great life is
great my mood is great and you just want
to stay there forever and you might even
think that you will and then the next
day things are down in that crash can
sometimes be so dramatic especially from
me I'm gonna be you guys that sometimes
that crash can be so hard to cope with
because you're like I was just feeling
so good I was just so high like what
happened like what what changed all this
and sometimes you can't control it like
sometimes it's just chemicals in your
brain sometimes circumstances happen
that you didn't expect
sometimes your statistic homework takes
you 10 hours to do and you just you just
cry in the school library and it just
happens it just happens
it did happen to happen to me yes so
that's why I say that you have to treat
the Sun and the darkness the shade as
the same because both of them are just
two different experiences where you can
learn from what can you learn from when
you're positive you're doing good how
can you say how can I repeat this
process what are you gonna learn from
when you're down how are you gonna
prevent this process so accepting the
flow of the nature of both of them and
understanding that it's gonna complete
you as a whole person in the end the
next thing that I want to say is really
important and this is don't judge
someone who's going through something
that you don't understand the other day
after I confess to someone that I was
feeling down that I was close to I we
ended up getting in a conflict over it
and I know she's gonna watch this video
I have no problem talking about it you
can text me about it or talk to me in
person about it later on girl for
watching but I noticed that she tweeted
something and I wasn't sure if it was
like a sub tweet towards me but whether
it was or not I'm gonna take it as if it
wasn't when you use it to talk to you
guys about it and preach about it she
literally tweeted some people need to
practice what they preach and the reason
I took that it's a sub suite about
myself is because I'm kind of seen as
like a positive role model in the media
but then that day I was like dude like
I'm feeling really down and I think that
she tweeted that as a substrate against
me because it would make sense because
it's like you need to practice what you
preach and you're like if you're down
you know you always talked about being
positive so you know be that person like
here's what we're gonna get into real
quick I don't know I need I need to read
this park to my laptop because this one
this one I got heated and it's just
really well worded okay just because I
have a platform based off of empowering
other people doesn't mean that sometimes
I don't fulfill that myself 24/7 I'm
learning too which is why I made this
platform is to share my learning not
just share my perfect life for whatever
I made this platform to share what I'm
going through and how I'm learning for
it so yes I am practicing what I'm
preaching so first off I'm preaching on
it state I'm also preaching that it's
okay not to be okay
and it's okay to be fantastic
too because you deserved me my platform
is based off of empowering other people
I do that through sharing my stories and
through sharing things that I go through
so while yes I do have these moments of
like euphoria where I'm like oh my god
the world is amazing it's a beautiful
place I'm gonna talk about and then the
tweet about I'm gonna make videos about
it
there's also moments where I'm down and
in those moments too like I am now
I'm not down right now I'm actually I'm
having a good day but when I'm having a
down day I like to also take that and
think how can I use this get through it
and then share it with other people when
I made this channel it was because and
I've since before I'm a really emotional
person it was because I was like there's
gotta be other people out there that
feels this way too and I want to help
them like I will have really down
moments and the thing that gets me out
of that 10 out of 10 times the thing
that gets me out of every single time
that I'm feeling down is you guys like I
know that sounds like oh my god the view
something every other basic youtuber
like I'm home so things no like I'm
serious whenever I'm having a down day
or I'm feeling down or whenever I'm
having an up day and I'm getting up all
I want to do is share that with you guys
to help you guys learn through what I'm
doing into what I'm feeling because
that's how we get better is that like I
feel like I can provide a shortcut to
you guys I'm missing away like oh hey
this is how I got out of this this
situation that they are like oh hey this
is how like I felt better about myself
in this situation like here take this
advice and let go use it like this
channel is about empowering you so I'm
not gonna do that through false
portrayals of my own happiness when I'm
not feeling that way like I'm gonna be
completely honest with you guys when I'm
struggling I'm a Gemini first of all so
I have very many different
personalities like some days I'll be
like will you guys know like if you
watch our videos you probably see 10
different personalities in one person
and that's I don't care like I went on
the incredibly insecure and I have to be
like oh my god like Who am I now I'm
just like screw it screw it I am Who I
am that day and that's who it's gonna be
I just kind of go with the flow thing
somebody's my hair is straight into the
parties in the Meadowlands amazes to the
side and in curl then I feel like I'm
legitimately two different people with
hairstyles that was off-topic I so the
topic of this video is how I say pause
at all time it's okay not to be positive
all the time what matters the most is
that you know just keep keep stretching
them muscles keep hydrating yourself eat
your protein to grow your muscles back
and do the same thing with yourself
nurture yourself nurture your mind read
books look at nature do things that you
can in the moments that you can because
you don't know what you have in this
life until it's gone you don't know what
you don't know how precious life is and
how every moment is completely temporary
sometimes you're down and sometimes
you're up sometimes you just want to
stay down and most of the time you just
want to stay up but at the end of the
day whatever you're going through is
going to help you become a more
well-rounded person so that you can
tackle life with even more strength
every day so
I just want to let you guys know it's
okay to be down like this video like I
kind of it had me pause at all time but
the truth is the truth is it's about how
to have balance how to accept the Sun
and the shade is the same thing
basically because they're both here to
help you grow if you didn't know how to
get that message the first 20 times that
I said I hope that you get it now thank
you for watching this video I felt like
I got a lot off my chest and I felt
really happy to have a video like this
