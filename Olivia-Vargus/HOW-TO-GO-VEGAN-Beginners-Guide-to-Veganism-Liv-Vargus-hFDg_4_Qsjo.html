you're new here my name is live I mean
even just every Monday and Friday it's a
good time feel free to subscribe and
join our family today I'm gonna explain
to you how to go vegan so think of this
as your complete beginners guide to
going vegan I wanted to make this video
because since it's almost New Year's a
lot of people want to go vegan in the
New Year's and they may get their
resolutions so I thought I wouldn't help
if I could before we get started I want
to know if I know and watching this is
already vegan and if you are I leave a
comment down below why because all of us
kind of have different reasons for going
vegan and maybe your comment will help
inspire and motivate someone else so
leave a comment down below also before
we get started you guys always ask me
what color I'm wearing on my nails and I
never remember but today I did so the
color that I have on my nose right now
it was called naughty not nice by le
mila and i thought it was the perfect
holiday color is it actually perfect to
talk about right now because ellen mila
are a vegan brand that's also
cruelty-free and eco-friendly i rarely
thought about the harmful chemicals in
other nail polish brands until recently
but i love that i found this brand
because i can completely rely on
everything that they make being free of
harmful chemicals and they make so many
cute shades that are honestly said good
quality and honestly better than other
nail polish brands that I've tried so
once again proving that you can live the
exact same life that you live before
going vegan just ditch all those ugly
harmful chemical based brands that you
used before and that you were kind of
used to using and just make the switch
over to the nice cute vegan friendly but
it Rand's like LME la le Mila is also
PETA certified and we love avid
beautification so thank you le Mila for
sponsoring this video I love getting the
opportunity to talk about and share my
love for vegan brands so I'll have a
link for Ellen Miele in the description
box and I seriously recommend that you
go and check them out because I
genuinely love and I think this brand is
so cute and I think that it's a great
gift for the holidays I know for me
personally it's gonna be my new go-to
brand for like cruelty free colors for
my nails and I think that you can really
honestly never
and if you do get anything from them
make sure you tag me in your pictures
that I can see what colors that you're
wearing all right so now let's get into
the video my first tip for going vegan
is pretty obvious but start by doing the
research so just like you are now
watching videos on YouTube is a really
great place to start out I also love
watching documentaries Netflix has some
really good vegan documentaries the most
popular ones are what the health which
is all about the health and nutrition
side of why you know humans shouldn't
eat me and what they should eat more of
a plant-based diet and also my other
favorite documentary is vegetated and
it's just about these like people in New
York who go vegan and it just shows
realize people going through the
real-life transition and I think that
it's such a great and honest documentary
I think both these documentaries are
really easy to digest no pun intended
and they're really good information and
great places to start out so that you
can have a good foundation of reasons
why you want to move in in order to stay
motivated to be vegan the next step to
take when going vegan is to eliminate
one food group at a time so when I
started I eliminated meat cold turkey
nobody intended again and then I ate up
the rest of the dairy products that I
had left and then when I was done with
all that
I just stopped repurchasing and so if
you live at home or if you live with
other people and you share food it is
more of a challenge but it's really not
impossible you just kind of have to go
out of your way and you know spend $3 on
it on the milk and some yogurt and
dairy-free cheese so it's not impossible
but you are surrounded by more
temptation which brings me to my next
step which is how to deal with cravings
for your old diet so I won't lie
sometimes I do like smell someone's like
hamburger or something I'm like dang
that smells good but the thing that you
need to remember is that the only reason
that that smells good to you is because
it was cooked and seasoned but you
wouldn't eat raw meat other animals
don't cook your meat like they just eat
it raw and humans don't do that because
like we all get food poisoning so isn't
that kind of a clear sign anyways like
why we shouldn't be eating meat so
basically you just have to learn it like
you know buy the same seasoning like
barbecue sauce is teriyaki sauce it's
like buy lots of seasonings and sauces
are gonna be your best friend the best
meat replacement brands hands down in
his garden and the beyond me burgers but
Gargan I've never met
who doesn't like our Dean it's the best
and the thing about Guardian is that you
can pretty much get at any big grocery
store and at a lot of restaurants now
and that's completely thanks to
organizations like PETA which start the
petitions to get big name stores to
provide vegan options so shout out to
them shout out to all the people out
there that are hoping to make the wrongs
of more being in place one restaurant at
a time
my next piece of advice for going vegan
is to follow other vegans online and
this one really helps you to feel like
you're part of a community it really
helps you to be inspired by other people
connect other people especially as
people in your immediate life and circle
aren't vegan like I don't have many
friends that are vegan but being online
and following other people that I love
and watching like what they're eating
and like how they're doing and just
watching them thrive and talk about
veganism it really just keeps you
inspired and it keeps you like just
enjoying the community and the life even
more so I definitely recommend I'll link
down below some of my favorite vegans to
follow online so you guys can check them
out and comment down below any other
people that you love online that you
follow that are vegan my next tip is
possibly one of the hardest things for
people otaku but basically it's how to
eat out so my rule of thumb when you
eating out around Sean is that pretty
much it's easy to see when there's meat
in something because I'm gonna say that
in the title but a lot of times
restaurants will hide dairy or hide
butter or even eggs in some of their
meals so I always usually ask after i
order what I want and say does that
contain any butter does not contain any
animal fat and if the server doesn't
know they can easily ask the kitchen in
the kitchen is trained to know that if
you're kind of anti-social like me
sometimes you can just google the
answers online and be like oh just pure
chains put butter in there right things
like that you can literally just Google
and you will be surprised there's an
answer for everything
except for of course like local local
restaurants for the most pirate
restaurants are pretty easygoing and
they will work with you I've rarely run
into problems and I'm almost always
prepared when I go to a restaurant you
know what I'm gonna order and ask but it
does kind of just take practice to get
to know like the eating out rules of
thumb so the next step that I have for
when you're eating out is just say you
have a dairy allergy some people are
assholes and they don't think it
seriously so if you say like oh I just
I'm vegetarian
dairy allergy ergo don't feed me dairy
or meat then the kitchens will 100% they
you seriously I say it everywhere I say
it at Starbucks because I get nervous
they're gonna be regular milk I just say
I have a dairy allergy it's just an easy
quick five words that I gotta say and
you're pretty much good to go people are
way more willing to be respectful when
it sounds like it's an allergy and it's
something you can't control my next tip
when you're grocery shopping it's pretty
easy but just read the labels of things
and like I said for restaurants you'll
know when something doesn't eat in it so
when you read the labels read to see if
it says contains dairy or contains eggs
if it says shared equipment with dairy
or eggs or if it says may contain traces
of I personally just like depending on
the brand and if I already trusted and
I've had had it before like I usually do
MIT it's okay
some people are really really strict and
they don't but that's completely up to
your personal opinion remember it's all
about the little things that you can do
to help don't put too much pressure on
yourself to be perfect when you go vegan
it's really just about thriving and
being ethical so the best that you can
do is honestly better than not trying at
all and so my last tip is that when all
else fails circle back to your original
underlying meaning of why you went vegan
so this is step number one that we
mentioned when you watch documentaries a
lot of times you know yoga inspired by
how awful animal agriculture is how you
realize it it's really bad for your
health to eat meat and dairy there's
just so many reasons to go vegan I mean
hello climate change in a lot of culture
has a huge huge effect on our climate
and it's really really important that we
take little steps here and there to
improve our lives in any way possible
just to improve the longevity of this
earth because we're only given one earth
like any just meat is being kind to
yourself and respecting that you are a
living entity on this earth and that
animals are living entity on this earth
and you both deserve the same compassion
and the same respect
I will leave below my favorite helpful
articles my favorite youtube videos that
explain this more in depth and my
favorite Netflix documentaries comment
down below anything else that's helpful
that you want to add to this and we can
have a discussion about it and if you
have any more questions leave them down
below because I know that this is a big
topic and there's so many layers to it
my goal for this video is to just be a
guide this is the steps that I took when
I went
and if you want a more in-depth on
anything from me please let me know and
that's all trying to help each other out
and answer each other's questions down
below I'll try and answer some myself
but if you see a question you want to
answer it for them please please please
feel free to step in and do that for us
and remember please always come to a
place of love no judgement and just
don't be condescending to people who
aren't vegan or who don't understand it
yet please don't be rude if you aren't
vegan and you're you think that this
lifestyle is stupid I'm not gonna sit
here and defend my veganism other words
and tales of their own opinions but you
do need to respect that facts and facts
and to even just look into the lifestyle
and do the little things that you can
every day maybe one meal a day maybe one
meal a week maybe just one month out of
the year just little things that you can
do that help here and there make a huge
difference I think even just Pizza Hut
recently made the in pizza an option
available all of their chain restaurants
which is insane because it just shows
that it's if you push for it and we ask
for it that's what's gonna make change
so sitting down at me and quiet and
thinking about what you being one person
isn't gonna make a difference it's not
going to help in any way because it is
true all of us collectively together are
what make the difference so I hope that
this video inspired you in some way the
lighting in my room is getting really
weird so I'm gonna peace out love you
guys so much thumbs up this video if you
liked it and subscribe for more being
sorry about health and thriving in
general school and I would see you guys
like lots of nice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
