my channel if you're new here my name is
live and today I'm going to be teaching
you how I slay on a budget
I'm not exactly on Extreme Couponing
level of smart shopping but I'm very
well on my way there and saving money is
cool you guys he's having money in
savings and being responsible it's
freaking cool you guys okay
don't let social media influence your
perception of realistic spending habits
most influencers are friendly hard and I
am NOT here for it I'm here for
responsible habits you guys but with
that being said treating yourself and
investing in your happiness when you
have the opportunity to do so
responsibly is perfectly okay so one of
the first tips I'm going to share with
you that I have been using to shop
responsibly it's this website and app
called shop tiger and this has changed
the frickin game for me you guys and I'm
actually partnering with shop tiger on
this video and I'm so excited to share
with you guys this genius website so
like I said I think that it's really
important to invest in yourself and I
especially like investing in things that
are more stable pieces and like where
everyday pieces for example sunglasses
jeans jackets purses and just things
that tend to be a little bit more
expensive but they're high-quality and
they're worth it cuz you use them every
day but because stable pieces usually
need to be a little bit more high
quality they are still a little bit more
expensive so a shop tiger you can create
an account either on their mobile app or
on your website I'd read one on their
website and then you just install cute
little play it onto your computer that
is super accessible and then you can
just go on your favorite websites on
what I am when you're watching spooky
Halloween movies on Netflix and eating
frozen grapes and shopping online you
can just save everything that you find
to one of their lists or wish list that
you created and then they will actually
notify you through either email or push
notification on your phone letting you
know what an item that you've saved
either goes back in stock or goes on
sale so for example I've been lying the
Jim shark seamless leggings for so long
but they have been out of stock and I
always miss the restock so in the States
Liz and I still wear to God the second I
get that email notification from shot
pattern say that they're back in stock
oh those babies are mine I'm not missing
this restock again I also think this is
gonna save my butt this holiday season
what I have to buy everyone gifts and
I'm gonna save everything to my list and
I'm gonna get all your gifts on sales
I'm gonna be on top of it this year I'm
gonna be early gift shopping okay I say
that every year but I'm through the most
last-minute person ever so the link to
shopped I will leave my description and
I highly suggest that you guys go and
check them out okay the next tip that I
want to share with you guys on how I
shop smart is a scam and I love it I'm
so excited so when I'm shopping
I only typically buy black and white
clothing and you guys probably know so I
mean it was even my Instagram mile for a
while like I never black and white and I
don't love to be basic I do it to save
money and I had this conversation with a
friend recently and she was like live
like all you own was black and white and
I was like yeah because if I were the
same black t-shirt three days in a row
or just like three times within the same
week like this would bring that
welcoming I've literally worn three
times no one's gonna notice it's like or
say anything unless they like really pay
attention to me which I hope that they
don't but if I wear the same say yellow
crop sweatshirt three times in a week
you're gonna notice so being able to
spend more money on like black and white
clothing and wearing them more often
nobody notices as much as when you wear
like colored clothing
I'll wear color and clothing when I'm
financially stable when my student loans
they're getting off oh we're going to
close this next tip I wish someone told
me sooner especially before the summer
but basically if you didn't already shop
on Amazon core you need to get your ass
there because Amazon is like creepily
taking over the world and basically you
can buy anything on Amazon like anything
at all for like half the price is like
anywhere else so I bought all of my
drugstore cosmetics on Amazon I buy like
my undergarments on
on you can actually get champion
sweatshirts on Amazon for like half the
price of what Urban Outfitters those
might you can get Kevin fine on Amazon
so don't sleep on Amazon Amazon's
like I said frequently taking over the
world the next tip is nothing new but
obviously if you don't already I really
recommend you trying to strip shopping
and what I do when I got there shopping
because it's very overwhelming all out
of the four sweatshirts and then I squat
them and you guys are always like well
we're gonna love that where's that from
I'm like well I you're up today and then
it crops it so I meet myself but it
looks like I spent money on it at like
Urban Outfitters no no no that
sweatshirt with six dollars and I just
cut the bottom off at my rib cage and
now it looks like a $90 expensive crops
by Sheree but hey my next tip for saving
money is to use your student discount
clothes so you can get these from your
college or if you have like an older
sibling or friend who's really generous
they can give you theirs and I use my
brother's before I was a college student
you don't have anyone that I'm so sorry
you can't participate in this but you
can get student discounts at a lot of
different places just by you know
college students which is dope thank you
my last two tips are mental shopping
tips so the first one is don't buy some
things unless you can afford to buy it
twice and I know that you guys might
have heard this before but like you need
to remember this while you're shopping
if you're on the fence about getting
something say like an $8 for sure
announcers could you buy that twice and
if the answer is no well you you can
walk away you can do it I believe in you
okay
stay strong the second one is something
that I personally use all the time and I
really recommend you guys think about
this
so basically when you're shopping and
you don't know if you should get some
they're not ask yourself would I wear
this out right now so when you're like
in free people and you see like five
different top so you try outside like
maybe I should just buy one of them
which one would you physically put on
your body and wear out right now and
that's so perfect because then it's like
oh I'm gonna feel comfortable mat or
that's on whether appropriate and then
it makes you think like okay this is
realistic portraits or maybe this is
realistic pictures and I want this right
now so I definitely recommend
considering that because I've saved me
if you have any other shopping tips that
I didn't mention please leave them down
below so we can all help each other out
here because we're trying to all be
responsible you guys responsible
spending habits for the win you can also
follow me on Instagram to see me scam
you guys in real life wearing black
t-shirts over and over again in
different situations you can also talk
to me on Twitter and add me on snapchat
to see my life and I love you guys so so
much make sure you subscribe if you're
not and put notifications on give us
returns up if you liked it you like
these tips give it a thumbs up so that I
know I will see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
