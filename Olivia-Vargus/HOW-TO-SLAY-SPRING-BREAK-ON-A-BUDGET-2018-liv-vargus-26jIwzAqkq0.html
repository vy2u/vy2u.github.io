to my channel if you're new here my name
is lip I make new videos every Monday
and Friday it's an angry face subscribe
and join our family and today I'm gonna
give you all my best tips for how to
sell a spring break
on a budget these are some really
reasonable tips for anyone who's a
student and wants to still have a really
good spring break without breaking the
bank you want to enjoy your life yes but
you also don't want to be like eating
ramen noodles for the next 10 months so
without further ado let's get into my
list of tips so usually the most
expensive part of travel is the actual
hotel so my tip is not even to like look
for near being the years of thing but to
actually stay at someone's house that
you know for free and they're not trying
to say like be a freeloader or something
but I have grandparents that live in
Florida and I would always go and see
them on spring break and my grandparents
aren't going to charge me money for the
week to stay with them you name mean
also if you have friends in different
hometowns in college and you want to go
and spend mr. Drake with down so I have
a friend that's from San Francisco I
also have friends that are from Southern
California like Laguna Beach San Diego
I'm also from Cape Cod which is really
big vacation spot so I always leave my
house open to any of my friends who want
to stay as a guest and you should only
do this rouble that you're actually
really close with and you don't feel
awkward like ass like I know who I would
ask and I wouldn't feel awkward asking
them just because they know that they're
invited to my place anytime and I know
I'm about to their place anytime because
we're just family more than friends you
know so the second part is frame rate
that gets really expensive is the outfit
I don't know why before Spring Break I
always feel the need to go out and buy a
whole new wardrobe so I'm talking about
this out in the past and it's actually
really good at helping you save money
shopping online it called shop tiger and
shop hanger is actually sponsoring this
video so I were talking here in the past
so my name you already know about them
but if you don't I'll give you the
little rundown on how it's gonna change
your life
so all you to do da shop hanger is
create an account on the mobile app or
on the website and I'm gonna show you
mine on my desktop because that's where
I usually shop and basically you just
have to install a plug-in onto your
computer which is super accessible and
then when you're shopping online like
normal and you're looking for spring
break outfits or whatever you're looking
for you can save them to the list that
you've created and shop Tector will
notify you if the price drops or if it
goes back in stock so I use this all the
time to get my
drunk leggings because a gym jerk is
always out of stop of my size of my
favorite leggings and so I'll put them
on my list and then when they come back
and stop I get the notification and then
I snatch them up right away and this is
so perfect right now because there's
always so many spring sales so if you
want to start saving stuff to your shop
have your list right now and then get
notified like within these next few
weeks when they start going on sale and
then you will be good to go you'll be
all set I love that it will notify you
when things are back in stock because a
lot of times the most popular things are
what goes out of stock so quickly and
you can never get and I get so
disappointed when I miss out on things
and so I really like that it will notify
me and I can be like oh yes mine I can
reach I need this you just like the
recipe all because shop Tiger gave me
that notification and I got everything I
needed right in time before when I
stopped again and I leave a link at the
top of the description box where you
guys can go make your own account and
save me money right now do not waste any
time you knew you get on this bandwagon
with me so my next tip is gonna be
another fashion tip for when you want to
slay on spring break and my favorite tip
for how to make an outfit really pop and
by that I mean like having a really
trendy outfit and not really even having
to put a lot of effort into it is having
neutral pieces in your wardrobe things
like denim jeans black jeans leggings
different sweatshirts different pair of
sneakers things that are staple pieces
but then having like one standout trendy
piece per outfit that you can rotate so
whether that's like a really bright
yellow handbag or a really cool belt or
a really cool a pair of shoes something
that just stands out that can be the
center of an outfit and and the rest of
the outfit is just kind of a blank
canvas for this one piece to stand out
with I think that those are always the
best looks and if you're wondering what
some of my favorite spring trends are
right now I'm really into plaid prints
and checkered print so wearing pants
that have like a checkered or a plaid
pattern and then a plain top and just
some Air Force Ones and just some cool
sunglasses and you're good to go my next
tip is gonna be for your food lovers out
there okay me so a lot of times when I
travel I spend so much money on food
when I eat out so what I like to always
try and do is I actually try
grocery shopping and I don't really get
a lot I usually just try and grab like
random snacks and things that will hold
me over and things that are a little bit
more filling so I obviously love Clif
bars
I love protein bars if you're lucky
enough to be staying somewhere that has
a microwave you can buy some oatmeal and
just use the water at the hotel or
wherever there's a lot that you can do
without having to break the bank so look
and see if you have a convenience store
nearby where you're saying or from your
grocery store and if you do eat out I
also really love sharing meals with my
friends because a lot of times
restaurants the serving sizes that they
give you are so big that you can totally
share them with your friends and split
the price of them too also if you're
traveling with friends or other people
that have the similar status you you can
totally swap clothing while you're on
vacation and get more looks for less
because you're just sharing clothing and
this only works if they're like the same
size or the same style as you my friends
I love sharing clothes me because like
they say one person's trash is another
person's treasure so like if your friend
has to talk about oh yeah like I don't
really care if you are on that or not
it's a brand new table to use and you
can get plenty of new wear out of it
also if you can't travel anywhere I
really recommend you do a staycation
I love staycations growing up in Cape
Cod it was obviously easier for me
because Cape Cod is literally a vacation
spot but if you live anywhere near a
city and by near I mean like two-hour
drive you know what I mean so you can
drive into a city for a night it just
book like a one night hotel stay there
that's always so fun I would do that in
Boston all the time or even to New York
which is like a four or five hour drive
from Cape Cod but you can definitely
still just relax and make the best of
your time and the best of what you have
it's not about comparing yourself to
like what other people are doing in
their spring breaks it's about like you
know what can you do to have the best
time you know and my last ship is gonna
have to do with traveling while you're
traveling basically so wherever you're
going make sure you know how you're
gonna be getting around so I love to the
Google just kind of rely on movers or
taxis and that's so expensive and it
adds up so fast so I really recommend
that before you book where you're going
try and see like can you walk through
all the places like if you're staying
maybe out of
resort you can just kind of stamp that
resort and go outside a beach that day
or I take some like trolleys around or
something cheesy like that you kinda
want to avoid renting a car or just
getting in any cars ever because they're
just for some reason so expensive so
taking bus it is taking trains walking
my foot you can rent bikes like see what
other options that you have that are
cheaper comment down below of what your
Spring Break plans are I am so excited
because I'm officially going to London
with my best friend I can't believe I'm
even saying that so excited feel free to
follow me on all my other social media

gonna be vlogging the entire trip and

least the best I love having her in my
