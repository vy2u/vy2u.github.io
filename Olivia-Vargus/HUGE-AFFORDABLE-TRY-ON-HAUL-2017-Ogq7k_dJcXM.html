 on your dick see it's not that
in the savory one what is that welcome
of my channel so today I'm going to be
doing a little bit of clothing loss
condition shaman he has a long something
so I'm super excited to doing this video
so I'm just going to get right into it
and show you guys on the top and I'm
going to do my best to put everything
down below so that you can find it all
online because I love these videos do
that for me so I got you guys alright so
the first in order to start with is
American Apparel and American Apparel is
basically people have invested their
habit of 40% off sale and 40% off is so
good so go check it out right now
I got two things when I went there so I
first got this body suit which I really
like the color of its like a burgundy
and it's got a keyhole in the back which
is really nice and others body juice in
there goes really stretchy and good
fabric and like comfortable so I think
there's like off then I really liked it
and I put this on my snapchat story of
the day that I got it shameless
self-promoter love you chat but when I
put this on my story I thought six
different people there Li like
screenshotting it and Sunday it to me
and asking me like where did I get this
and it's American a girl and it's
basically it looks like at the kids but
it's a white sweatshirt
zip up but it's cropped and I'll just
show you guys how it looks on because I
think that this is so cool I wear off
the shoulder and like there's a lot of
some things you can do with this um so
yeah don't those the other things that I
got provides in apparel but if you like
those go to the hall not before they're
gone forever so the next thing that I
got that I really like is disturb jeans
from Urban Outfitters and when I got
them they're having 30 percent off all
bdg jeans which is like the urban out
jeez I'm pretty sure but it could be
relevant if any video is but whatever so
these are just regular monkeys and they
had it in on a dark wash she was dark
black and I almost caught them but I
figured I'll just get these first and
see how you like them but there's a
basic mom jeans thing I really like
coffee jeans is that the fabric is not
really stick with Topshop and other
seasons make really big mom jeans and
these are a flexible lips scissors denim
fabric so they're like comfortable
conducive to down and long jeans and
like using my speeds like they're
high-waisted shorts when you sit down
it's like the fabric just like your body
do you know what I'm talking about
I hope you do so I don't sound stupid
but like the other moms do basically so
if they're looking for pairs comfortable
mom team Chucky dolls so next up I have
two more pairs of jeans and these are
from fashion Nova and if you don't know
if asked you know but it is like an
online store and I hold couple of in
store locations so absolument
really good teams and I'm a size five in
their jeans if you need a reference
because they're dangerous
sighs so really and when I first ordered
from them they told me to order a size 9
and we came and it was way too big so
I'm a size 5 that's perfectly fits me I
wanted 26 inch waist and like other
music aside like 16 so yeah I'm one of
these two genes from that I really like
them this first guy I thought was
high-waisted don't upset about that but
they're just like cool jeans and they
have big grips which I like and then at
the bottom I just wanted to because I
wanted to bottom but I thought that they
were cool to wear different shoes
they're really in right now like this
like weird braiding hair so I got these
so if you want to go like this but they
have a bunch more but I don't think -
just these ones because they're not
high-waisted
and I really I'm still thinking like
but for the price I like them next I've
been wearing too much almost because I
love black Jean and that these just have
a really big side cut out basically and
they're black and they're smooth guilty
and is so beautiful and comfortable
I just such as good everyday team they
go absolutely everything the waist like
that mid rise high rise it was not
ridiculously up high but it's like
comfortable it's my favorite kind my
right so if you guys like it
you want back know when this stuff is
not super expensive and they almost
always have promotion codes going on so
I definitely expect me to the next to
face that basically just double damage
on and so we'll start with hmm
and I've actually worn that I were just
in my last video and I wish my taxes on
the side sticks I got it in size 4 but
it's like a linen silk ish type top and
I just need pretty is looking it on for
it looks like it's free people but I
thought I think I wanted to like wear it
over other things like opening that sigh
when you wear it I want to be as or not
basically but I got it too small I
didn't try it on the next thing I got
I'm hope I'm so in love with it because
if you don't know Juicy Couture like the
Lord whatsis or whatever are they coming
back in and so people are like looking
everywhere for some velvet and I
found this one hmm
and basically just like a velvet lorises
this is between those two words I don't
know but it's the honey
really nice and it's just it's so
comfortable and soft and I just think
it's a great every day to do I decide
enlarge because like yeah I want to
emphasize large so I wanted it to be
oversized I almost wish I got me an
extra large but yeah take my advice
the next day I got a hmm is I just
caught this play regular like suede
skirt it's like a lion I just wanted a
skirt like this for like professional
use and like for dressing up and was
like who does not love that and lastly
from H&amp;amp;M aisle office with a bunch of
jewelry so I bought these three rings
without a show you up close cause like
this is Matthew so I'll teach three
rings and then I got a set of poop
because everybody from wearing stately
and I was like I want to get on a band
on but then I must be like how specific
on me but that's another story
so next I want to show you guys
everything that I got from forever 21
um a lot but basically I first got this
choker which is just super simple and
it's not a toy on it so I liked it I
want to make a black suede children was
like some like detailing so it wasn't
just like clean so I bought this and I
liked it and then I got like a couple of
skirts and I like skirts right now for
like putting pleasures over or like long
shirts over and I kind of like just
making it was messy casual but like you
have a skirt on you look class day so
you know to me and then I also got this
white one but this is denim and I really
wanted this online and I like one thing
you wear it out when you buy denim white
anything not even denim it does it's
going to be see-through so plan
accordingly like this I have to wear
with something under it next four things
are also the purpose of working outside
pull myself if I spend some money on
workout clothes I'll use them and it's
true clay juice is one outfit last night
and this so I got these leggings and
there were only like 50 95 so I got
these leggings and they were only like
$15 and I think they're pretty good
qualities or dark green which I like
because I don't want any guards
legging and yeah there was a good six
material so I like to and then I got
these shorts which actually really like
they have pockets now the thought really
matters I just like the lat elastic
waistbands
and they're just shorts shorty short
short shorts and an inner block
yeah depends to go inside I bought this
white hot and this is sucks like I can
you got foundational Mississippi the
 I wasn't all this living foundation
for me I'm livid worse and it's a
believe chef Justin Bieber um I don't
know I the outfits that I got for
working out literally scream I'm only in
the gym once a week and I don't want to
be here so they're perfect essentially
so that concludes the workout stuff that
I got maybe a workout routine coming
soon probably not don't get your hopes
up lots to things that I thought I've
got um basically drifted but you can
find these items like at enemies like
corned beef or Poshmark like these kind
of things are always being posted the
first thing is this champion
long-sleeved t-shirt and it's just blot
and it's it's so plain like it doesn't
even really even have the logo why but
it just like comfortable and I feel like
obviously you've already boarded like
four nights in a row to bed like after I
washed it so and I've worked it class
and I just like I don't know I feel this
period was like a skirt is I feel look
that I'm going for
so if I love it and I'm different like
low-key obsessed with even though like
some kind of late on the bandwagon to
get something like this but it's
basically just a really big ascidians
the cute and I wanted extra-large and I
wanted to be like a dress and it so
harley-davidson
