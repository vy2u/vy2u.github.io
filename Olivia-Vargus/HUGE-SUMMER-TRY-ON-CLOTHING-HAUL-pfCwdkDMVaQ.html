my channel or if you're new to my
channel welcome so today I'm going to be
doing a bit of a clothing haul for you
guys so I'm really excited to show you
guys using my favorite new pieces and
I'm literally wearing them every day
already like I didn't even wait before
filming this to take all of the tags off
of everything so I'm going to be trying
on everything in this video for you guys
see their thumbs up if you like it and
comment down below what pieces you like
you know any styling suggestions help
your girl out and let's just get right
into the video
so if you saw my blog I went to brandy
Melville and I tried on this two-piece
set and I really liked it but I didn't
end up getting the bottoms because I
thought that it would be too hot in the
summertime and I didn't know if I liked
it the way they felt anyway so I ended
up just getting the top which is still
really cute and it's just a basic tube
top but I love the color I'm really into
blush tones right now even though it
kind of washes me out and less I'm like
really sad and in the right lighting but
anyways I just really love to tough and
you're going to see I have like five
tube tops to show you today I'm wearing
one right now this is actually the next
thing I'll show you but this is the only
thing that I got from brandy melville
and yeah so five weren't a few times and
I think it's just versatile and it's
coming to new summer staple teen top to
stock up on a bunch of these two the
next thing that I got was that Urban
Outfitters and it's this top which I'll
just show you it on and I got it in
black it's a medium large size because
the small / medium size was too small
for me
but it's kind of like overpriced for
what you're getting but it is good
quality and I'm probably going to get a
lot of wear out of this because I love
wearing black as many times as I try and
add color to my wardrobe it just doesn't
work so last tube tops it is the summer
I also really like the material of just
kind of being like a stretchy and
different material and there isn't so
much a pattern to it but there is sort
of like a little bit of detailing with
different sort of knitting styles and
the little ruffles I think are really
cute so it's definitely in summer sable
the next hop that I got if you guys are
going to be like can you stop with the
shoe stuff that I told you I'm saying it
all these out of the way so this
from PacSun I got it on sale for like $5
and I bought it because it's just
literally a basic basic black to top I'm
going to get so much wear out of it it
says go away at the bottom which is kind
of mean but so there isn't really much
to say about this other than like I got
it because it was super cheap and it's
just a basic black dude dog alright so
the next thing that I purchased was from
Free People and am I the only one that
thinks about that's because Bull gives
you is like the most awkward thing ever
anyways so I had a salad on line for so
long now and it should say call it vegan
leather that way they can like get away
with it literally just big safe cheap
leather whatever
I don't like fine leather at all and I
really wanted to get a small little
backpack for the summer and you guys
probably already seeing it wear this on
my Instagram I wish that it wasn't 16
powder honestly but it's fine I also
wish that it wasn't silver Hardwick's
I've recently committed myself to gold
so I'm not gonna be drinking I'm being
so picky right now three people $60
really like it the next two things that
I got I'm not really sure where you can
buy them but maybe you can get some
inspiration from them because it's kind
of one of those like drifty store places
but I've got it on Cape Cod
in p-town as just like marine store if
you're funky Cod you know of it but if
you're not I'm sorry if all we don't
know what I'm talking about but I got
these two t-shirts and I basically have
worn them both already as beach cover-up
and I think that with my sneakers that I
bought that I'll show you later they
look so good there's just such an easy
casual summer look like I live for this
 so the first one looks like this
and it has a Levi's vintage pattern or
not pattern but like sing on it and it's
not a screen printed it like has texture
to it you can tell that it's going to
last a long time and it is in an
extra-large ooh double extra-large size
it's just so easy you can eat so much no
one will see that you're blown is the
next one it's also another Levi vintage
one I'm so lucky I found these like
they're so cute this color kind of
washes me out but we're going to work
with it so this one has a California
bear kind of pattern on it but it's also
the vintage Levi's and I just oh my god
that's literally my makeup is already
stained on you guys so I guess like just
draw inspiration to melt by like looking
for extra-large men's t-shirts or
vintage t-shirts with like Levi's Calvin
Klein Ralph Lauren like buy them all
second-handed it was like $12 free shirt
and I'm going to wear them everyday so
this next top I decided that I already
don't really like cause it's kind of
like forever21 looking but it's from
Zara
so yeah it's personally looking because
they're both fast fashion but it was on
sale for $10 which is why I got it and
it's just a basic safety is egg like oh
my god we already know that I'm a basic
bitch obviously but like this top and be
like little epitome of being basic it is
black it's a crop top and it laces up in
the front I bought this because it's
hella versatile and I just felt like I'm
over where my other black crop tops
already so I just was like I should just
buy more so here I am so the next thing
that I'm going to show you I have
already wore in every single goddamn
diet and I'm pretty sure that I've worn
them to the beach too but they are the
Nike Air Force one sneakers and these
sneakers have very quickly become my
life I swear I tried to learn to be like
girly and wear boots and sandals but I
just can't I don't feel like myself so I
always wear white tennis shoes or white
like Nikki the Divas whatever I have for
that day
so these everyone homes like a pair of
Nike Air Forces and I think I want the
Air Force
I don't twos now these are the Air Force
one so they're the low top I want to kid
size in and I got I'm usually a woman
eight and I think these are like a kids
size 7 and there were like $15 cheaper
and they fit perfectly so pro tip if
you're like a woman's 8 or 9 you can
wear the kids sizes so I definitely
definitely recommend if you don't own a
pair of these for the summer get your
hands on some I got my finish line and
the Cape Cod Mall you can literally get
them anywhere they're so classic ok guys
I was like I'm naked or now but lastly
I'm going to show you all of the stuff
that I got in Maine from the Calvin
Klein outlet store in Kittery Maine and
I have never spent so much money in a
let's stir before but I went ham we all
know that Calvin Klein like 25 Galvan
life is being sponsored by everyone
right now and this isn't sponsored like
you guys know me I'm not like
Calvin Klein please bother me because I
love your like I've never loved to
brands aesthetic more in my life but it
just like clicked when I walked into the
outlet store I was like this is my
aesthetic look everything in here is
everything that I ever want to wear and
be in my oh my god okay let's just get
into what I'm going to show you some
talking too much so first I'm going to
show you I'm just going to show you my
new wallet that I bought from them it on
sale was probably like $20 retail
probably like 60 but it has their modern
Calvin logo I love the inside of it like
it's Justin saw like my in there
but it's just the perfect wallet that
I've been looking for for years because
I had a Michael Kors ones that I
freaking hated and disgusting to me and
it fits perfectly inside my backpack
that I just bought so win-win okay so
when you I first walked into the store
the first thing that I saw was a
ton of logo t-shirts and I picked out
one black one in one white one and I got
two in a size small so I could tie it in
a knot in the front and I wear as a
crosswalk also it's not like the screen
print like I was talking about before so
it's something that you know is going to
be like quality it's like glossy and
it's going to last through a lot of
washes and the black one is the same
glossy screen print and I've literally
worn these every day I cannot get enough
of them I want more of them I spend $20
on each of them I don't know the full
price once I grabbed three pairs of
their leggings they were all I think $30
after it being on sale so the first pair
is something I've never really owned
before which is like this cloudy like I
don't know what to call this pattern but
it's like the tie-dye kind of dark gray
and light blue
I've offset all of the leggings in a
size medium because they ran a little
bit small these will do the only ones I
think are a little bit big actually and
I probably could have bought a small of
them the next ones are
one that I wear everyday now because
black leggings are life and I love them
since they come up to the perfect place
on my waist like it's everything I've
ever wanted a legging I love them more
than like my loose fit and I like these
black ones they say Calvin in the glossy
like print down at the bottom Tom Klein
so they're not just like plain black
they do have a little detailing and then
the last pair of leggings I thought was
like a heather gray and they have white
logos down at the bottom and I'm
obsessing Academy host pick so good and
they're just the most comfortable like
nylon ish material guess what we
recommend if you need new leggings you
don't want to break the bank on them
they're probably on sale online still so
go check them out mine are all size
medium just again for reference the last
two things I'm going to show you are
these sweat pants I bought and have
literally already worn every day they
are a little bit cropped at the bottom
and they say Klein on one side Calvin on
the other they're black they're comfy
they're soft they're everything in life
and lastly because we know as I've
covered a thousand times I for the life
of me cannot be a girl I cannot just
wear shorts like I have to just always
be comfortable so I got these common
fine shorts between oh man it's so much
wear out of I tied this in a bit of a
knot and I wear them sort of
high-waisted and I'm just obsessed
so I basically mix and match all of
these pieces to t-shirts and the
leggings and then I wear them with my
Nike shoes and it just looks my backpack
everything like oh I'm dying I'm so
happy this is my aesthetic one last
thing that I want to show you guys is I
recently purchased because the M
Jewelers which is like a really nice
jewelry store online so a lot of people
are known for wearing I finally finally
purchased two pieces because they were
having a for yourself down which lasted
to the fourth of July so I don't think
it's still happening but just a website
just in case they might have extended it
so I got these two and I'll listen
scrimmage there Coughlin don't remember
the bottom one says Olivia and the top
one is just a plain choker just for
layering and I want to get so many more
but I wanted to just start off with like
two of them but I got such a good deal
and then like I was so happy
