to my channel if you're new here my name
is Lib I make new videos every Monday
about it it's a good time for free
subscribe join our family right now I'm
standing in my kitchen and I'm gonna be
doing a grocery haul for you I got back
to LA last night after Christmas break
raise your hand if you feel personally
victimized by the holiday season because
oh my god didn't do me dirty I
definitely definitely ate so so bad for
like three weeks in a row and I kept
justifying it because I was like I'm on
me home version all the time when I go
actually school it's gonna be meal
copying in like not boring food but you
know I'm not gonna have access to all
this good stuff and homemade stuff and I
also only workout like three or four
times in the past four three weeks not
four weeks this video is gonna be
perfect for people who need to get back
on track and get groceries that will
help them remain focused on some of
their New Year's resolutions and do not
let you know maybe a little bit of extra
seasonal sickness make you feel down
don't let it ruin your motivation
because obviously I see it as like a
nice challenge to start the New Year's
with I'm like okay like let's see how
hard I can push my body and to getting
back into the lean shape that I want to
be in so I won't go shopping at Trader
Joe's and then I stopped by Whole Foods
quickly on the way home
to get a couple more things I couldn't
grab but for the most part you can get
this all at Whole Foods or like all at
Trader Joe's by the way I am also vegan
and I tried a just plant-based as
possible knowing that it's not always
possible I joined to follow the rule of
thumb that like if it had a life then
it's probably good for you a lot of it
was mind if I don't go to meat but what
I'm talking about is plants they are
alive to surprise so things like that I
try and gear towards so our first knock
is gonna be a pre-workout have pre
breakfast food that I wanted to try
because it was coffee and cacao in like
a little bite-sized snack through two of
them was disturbing and it's 90 calories
these I just thought would be good in
the morning because sometimes I'm not
hungry before the gym but I feel like I
need to eat something so I'll get hungry
in the middle of my workout and I don't
like feeling dizzy so any small bite
sized things like this are usually
really good here's a close-up on the
brand name if you
take them out I also picked up this is
from Target but I got the dark roast
coffee k-cups from the donut shop
because this is the only coffee that I
drink so you guys know I pretty much
have overnight oats every morning for
breakfast so I just picked up a huge bag
of this instead of buying quick cut oats
try and buy the whole like whole grain
oats or whatever because if you make
them overnight oats they come out crisp
in the morning since making them hot
it's just it takes so long to make on
the stove and my probe it just comes out
like trash so making them overnight
tastes so good and they have a higher or
lower in camera which way it goes but
glycemic index look that up basically it
just means that don't keep you fuller
longer rather than a quick cut oats
won't keep us full for us and long I
know that was kind of like a confusing
bit of information but I just say try
and get the bagel with my overnight oats
I always try and have some service
protein plant-based milk this is the
ripple dairy-free milk and it has 8
grams of plant-based protein love this
because it just tastes the same it's
just a vanilla unsweetened favor and it
adds a grams of protein for only 7 70
calories so really good way to start
your day and then become literally like
I'm so sorry I eat the same thing all
the time you guys probably want more
just like different varieties of
breakfast from me but I always eat
overnight lows with frozen cherries and
I just chop a few of these in there at
night time and they just taste the best
to me so for lunch I had this really
good idea that I wanted to use sweet
potato because I love sweet potatoes
especially in the afternoon they make me
feel so good so I got a huge bag of them
and then I wanted to make like a chili
or something and then like pour the
chili on top of the sweet potato like
opened up for lunch and so I'll show you
what I got for those so I got a couple
cans of diced and a no-salt-added
tomatoes so this will be the base of the
chili and then I couldn't decide which
beans to get so I got organic pinto
beans and flat beans I don't know if
I'll use them both or just one but
always rinse and drain the salt out of
your beans before using them I find it
easy to buy vegetables frozen so I just
got this one from Trader Joe's any
frozen vegetables will work but I
probably should have gotten more than
just one bag because this doesn't feel
like a lot but and then lastly I
I'm gonna add this just yet or not but
this is the beef was ground meat from
Trader Joe's try this before and I
really liked it and it's pretty much I
feel like all fake ground beef tastes
the same in my opinion but if you've
never tried one you can get this at
Trader Joe's for like $3 and I think
it's really good I also bought chilli
powder and I don't know where that what
I'm going to look for that but the idea
is to make all of that together an
import or the soup potato and that will
be like a pre filling and satisfying
lunch and a lastly for dinner I bought
two bags of spinach I'm gonna try and
make smoothie bullets from dinner time
because following the theme of guys
seeming indexes and paying attention to
foods that make you feel full longer
I never feel that full after eating a
smoothie bowl and it usually only keeps
me satisfied for like an hour or two but
that's okay because I like to fast at
nighttime so at 8 o'clock I kind of
stopped eating because I go to bed
around 10:00 or 11:00 and then I wake up
the morning and I have you know I go
through my day so I like to have things
that are like a smaller dinner and then
I obviously like eating my huge lunch
but I got two bags of spinach to put
into a smoothie again I'll use my
protein almond milk and I might go to
GNC tomorrow at the gym and try and get
some new protein powder and I'll show
you that like on my snapchat or
something so add me if you don't have me
already and I will show you what I pick
up and then to put on top I got some
coconut chips because I just think that
the crunch is so satisfying and then I
also got this granola this is another
brand that I had never tried before and
I got this at Whole Foods most granolas
have a high sugar amount and I hate that
so I was just gonna make my own but I
saw this and it didn't have that much
and it just seemed like it had a lot of
good stuff in here and I was like I'm
gonna give it a try I'll probably use
like just a little sprinkle of it on top
and we'll see how I feel about it this
is the brand if you want to take a
closer look at it and lastly I just got
some raspberries because I think that I
can throw these on top of like my
oatmeal or on top of my smoothie bowl
and also I just love snacking on them
because berries have the lowest sugar
count and so I would love
and then lastly I got a random block of
tofu I got nothing else to eat with it
just tofu so we'll see if this is like
gonna happen at all this week but I just
got it because I was like have it just
because I couldn't decide and then the
last stock that I got is these weird
little discs from Trader Joe's this is
so weird and definitely a new item
they're called nothing but fruit and
nuts and they contain date hazelnut and
cacao and let me show you what they are
so basically they're just these little
discs and they literally just are like a
solid bar of the date in the cacao and
here's a nut combination they're only 80
calories per serving and they have 13
grams of sugar but it is dates and
that's why I just got these I thought if
I was having like a sweet tooth craving
I could so see myself reaching for
something like this and also they
advertise like it's great for snacks on
the go and that really got me because I
was like oh snap some ago I have school
started soon do you guys can grab
somebody they put through my bag so I
think I'm gonna put those in the
refrigerator and I think they might be
really good my apologies for possibly
saving a little bit tired in this video
I got in last night like really really
late and also I'm just super jet LAG's
it's like a love in art oh yeah I'm for
me right now so thank you so much for
watching anyways I hope that you enjoyed
my little food haul and I will
definitely be doing what I eat in a
videos later because I like absolutely
love those hits of videos I just want to
make like more creative recipes and
that's my goal I bought so many
cookbooks and I can't wait to use them I
bought pretty basic food that's because
I can rely on them and I know that since
I'm just trying to jump back into thing
and get my fitness stuff going again I
just wanted to like rely on this food
and then I'll probably start doing more
creative recipes and a couple of weeks
but for now this is just like we're
getting back into it if you like this
video leave a thumbs up thank you so
much for watching I will you enjoyed and
I will see you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
