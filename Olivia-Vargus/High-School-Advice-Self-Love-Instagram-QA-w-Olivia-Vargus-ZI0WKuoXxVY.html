doing a Q &amp;amp; A I actually questioned on
my last YouTube video and on one of my
Instagram posts and I wouldn't do them
and pick the best I'm gonna answer them
we just hit seventy thousand subscribers
which is so amazing you guys think I'm
literally so filled with love and
gratitude for every single one of you
that I subscribed to my small little
dumb ass and they're so blown away by
how positive and beautiful all of you
are my life right now is just going so
fast like I'm so all over the place
because I just flew home from the East
Coast so the three hours I'm your
friends and then I'm flying to San
Francisco tomorrow which there's some
time difference but I'm just gonna be so
tired from all this traveling and
everything is like out of order I'm not
in routine like I haven't been working
out or like even like eating super good
lately so I'm so out of whack right now
so thank you guys for your patience I
know a lot of people just started
following me like we're growing so fast
so you're coming on to my channel on a
pretty weird time for me but a couple
weeks things will be back to normal
smooth sailin I think I hope but anyways
I'm so excited to answer some of these
questions I'm gonna go through them and
yeah let's just get started be sure Mari
asked what is your favorite place you've
traveled and where do you want to travel
I think it was eighth grade but I went
on a trip to Greece in Italy and I loved
both of those places specifically
Florence Italy I remember just loving
like cobblestone streets and the Italian
culture so I definitely definitely want
to go back there someday
Dianna's asked would you kiss a frog in
case he turns into your prince charming
honey
I would kiss a pile of if it turned
into my prince charming but then again
my ex was a pilot and that's gonna work
out so maybe not re dead asked was it
hard to stop eating me honestly no I've
talked about this so many times on my
channel but when you're passionate about
being vegan you're doing it mainly
usually for the ethical reasoning so
when I first started and
now to this day I just stopped being me
because I was so morally against Italy
it resonates as like as if I'm looking
at human flesh
so I basically cut eating meat like cold
turkey I want a vegetarian but then I
had to like kind of like inch out of
eating dairy that one was a little bit
tougher genesis Mario Pedro is how do
you find your passion hmm
I don't even think that I have found my
passion in life I'm always searching I
think honestly your passion sciency you
I think that just having an open mind
and just try out different things and
being optimistic but it's gonna open
doors to things that you've never heard
of and that you've never experienced and
through that that's how you find your
passion jazzy 101 I'm sorry I'm saying
like all these names are on by the way
so jay-z 101 said how do you guys treat
you now versus before you lost weight I
wouldn't know because I don't really
talk to guys they don't talk to me
either I'm a pretty single right now
smiles
Alexis asks what's your spirit animal I
think I should have had answers to these
before I started filming so I don't sit
here for five minutes like thinking
about the question I don't know you guys
let me know down below what you think my
spirit animal is okay wait I think a
hundred percent a cat and I always used
to say that I think I was a cat and when
my past lives just by like a cat's
attitude that comes super standoffish
but if you like sit there like I'll come
to you and like I just want like
attention in love but I also don't trust
anybody
yeah I got a lot of people ask me this
question
so this one's from Maria and she said
how to work towards self-acceptance and
love I'm not gonna say that it's an easy
journey and I'm not gonna say that I
have achieved this journey yet and as I
said in my last video like this is still
something that I'm working on but I
think that the first step is to just be
super super transparent with yourself
and honest with yourself and be like
what is my problem what do I want to
change what do I want to fix and go from
there and health needs by possible there
is so so many layers to this but I think
that the most important ones for me were
to remember that at the end
today this is my life in my body I don't
care what anyone else has to say about
it as long as I'm healthy and happy I
have the choice to be positive and I'm
gonna make that because City being
negative about my body and sitting there
just being in a pit of negativity gets
me absolutely nowhere except for just
further and further into a pit of
negativity so just taking the bold risk
and being like I'm just gonna love
myself and it's obviously not that easy
but it's a start and I definitely
recommend you make that choice so Laura
asked me what is a quote that you live
by I am such a quotes person I think I
have two hero codes
and I'll tell you one of them today okay
so my favorite quote is your visions
hopes and high standards are here to
inspire you not scare you and that's a
really important quote to me because I'm
definitely perfectionist I'm definitely
really hard on myself with a lot of
things in life and so I started to
change my point of view and let myself
relax a little bit into the fact that my
high standards that I have for myself
aren't supposed to scare me but rather
inspire me to work towards those who
work hard so that's the answer that
Sidney asked what is one food you could
live off of for the rest of your life oh
oh I already know this i 100% think I
could live off of acai bowls for the
rest of my life baby girl Cece do you
have a boyfriend so I'm looking for a
boyfriend
I am the 100's always looking for a
boyfriend they just I don't know aren't
looking for me I guess Minnie Minnie
asked what is your zodiac sign what is
your favorite color and who is your
favorite music artist Gemini pink and
Khalid and Lord Maya Arnold asks what is
your favorite place to shop and who is
your favorite youtuber so I think my
favorite place to shop even though I
don't really even get to shop here that
often because they're super expensive
it's free people because they have so
many vegan things and then my favorite
youtuber is someone who doesn't even
really post that often but I still love
her to pieces and it's Claire Michelle
and if you've never watched her before
go and watch like her life story videos
and she talks like an hour and it's just
gonna change your life go watch her okay
this question I was so hoping someone
would ask me this so I could talk about
it so marina Acosta said what is your
favor
TV show at the moment I have been
obsessed with Teen Wolf since junior
year in high school when I binge-watched
their first three seasons and then ever
since then I've literally been known by
my friends for being Teen Wolf crazy so
they're on their last season right now
so I'm literally dying it's very
bittersweet
Kirsten asked what is your favorite
vegan meal right now I think that my
favorite meal right now is definitely
the curry sauce on anything and I made
it my last when I eat in a day video and
it's literally the best thing so oh my
god to my friend Sophie commented on my
picture and she's totally roasting me
right now so she asks me what did I
almost get tattooed behind my ear a
couple years ago okay so I'm so stupid
but when I was 17 years old I thought it
would be hilarious for my first tattoo
when I turned 18 years old to be up a
piece of bacon which I at the time I
don't know what I was thinking but I
thought like I was so serious too but I
was like it'll be so funny like I
thought it would be funny for the rest
of my life and I was also addicted to
bacon by the way the one thing that
could have counter accident being like
kind of ish funny was me going vegan so
yeah I'm an idiot
Thanks Sophie's reminding me um Liz Kay
asked do you ever think about doing some
kind of meet-and-greet in the future PS
I love you so much I love you so much
well everything is really happening to
me very quickly and this whole like
youtuber thing is still very new to me
and it's what I've always wanted to do
and this is what I literally want to
throw my life like if you're here right
now you're gonna hopefully be here for
the next like five years and when we
know we're about out baby but the whole
meeting great thing I would love to if I
ever get lucky enough to get to that
point in my career that would be amazing
like I would 100% be down for that if
you were a senior in high school again
what affirmation would you tell yourself
that would shape you such changer
mindset the time and that was from
Yasmin um oh I don't remember high
school like at all like you know how
when you just think back on your life
and you can't remember
middle school or you can't remember
elementary school like you know that it
happened and if there was some good and
bad times in there but you just don't
remember anything see pictures I am only
two years out of high school and I don't
remember it so if that gives any of you
any consolation there you go
I think the biggest thing that I can
tell you is to 100% appreciate who you
are right now in this moment and who
others around you are right now in this
moment because you will never be this
person again and they will never be this
person again so just appreciate it like
this moment that you're in that stuff's
gonna happen all the time and you just
grow stronger from it anything that
happens to you in life it's an
opportunity to grow stronger so just
take it whatever it's gonna give to you
just take it and just say I'm gonna come
out of this better than I was when I
started okay guys that's all the time
that we have for questions today if you
have any more that I didn't get to you
leave them down below and I'll try and
look at the comments and answer as many
as possible I'll also probably do more
Q&amp;amp;A videos in the future so do not worry

Instagram and my Twitter and my snapchat
the trifecta and make sure you subscribe
