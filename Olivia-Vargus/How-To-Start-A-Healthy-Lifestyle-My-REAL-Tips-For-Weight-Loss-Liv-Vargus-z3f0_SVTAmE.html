channel if you're new here my name is
live I make new videos every Monday and
Friday it's a good time feel free to
subscribe and join our family someone
recently came up with the idea of
calling our family too Sam Olli like oli
I think that's adorable so comment down
below what your thoughts on that offer
because I think it's so funny you can't
like say it without laughing it's cute
but into today's video topic so today
I'm gonna be talking to you guys about
the truth behind you know how much I eat
in a day and the calories that I consume
and if I count calories all that we're
just going to cover all of it and I'm
gonna give you guys all the information
that I have been holding back because I
find as I said weight loss videos to be
super triggering I used to search all
over the internet for how many calories
I should be eating and it's just such an
unproductive way to think about the new
lifestyle change that I was in fact
you're looking for so instead if you are
someone who stumbled upon this video
because you are looking for ways to lose
weight or to just get a better body and
feel healthier I want you to instead
look at it as health gain and not weight
loss so start looking up ways to gain a
health and like ways to get out there
because if that's the mindset that I had
started with instead of the one where I
was like I need to lose weight I think
it would have been a lot I think that it
would have been a lot healthier journey
for me like no but I would have had
more positivity along aligned with
myself instead of like this negative
like feeling of I have to do something
instead of I want to do something so for
those of you that I've been following my
health journey for the past year or so
it's actually still fairly recent this
whole journey has started and a lot has
happened within a year I am very proud
of myself for all that I've achieved but
when I first started this health journey
I was mainly looking to lose weight and
I
trying to slim down and now the journey
that I'm on is I'm trying to bulk more
I'm trying to get muscle mass and I'm
trying to go harder in the gym so the
reason that my focus switched from
losing weight and doing cardio and all
that mumbo jumbo to now trying to eat
more and gain muscle is that I was kind
of getting tired of my old gym routine
and I wanted something that was more
that I had more control over and I'll
get into more detail later basically
after weight training now my mindset has
changed from I love my body to I love
what my body can do and that's like a
really big thing that's a really big
difference so before when I was eating
less and trying to lose weight I was
more focused on my mindset and getting
the willpower to do some and when I say
the willpower I mean like the willpower
that it would take to break the old bad
patterns and habits that I had
accumulated that had got me into that
situation in the first place and it was
really all about convincing myself that
I could love fitness and I want to
reiterate that I love this saying that I
was originally inspired by to start my
entire journey and basically this lady
had put on her Instagram saying like I'm
so happy that I fell in love with
Fitness and I've said this before it's
like falling in love with something is
such a more positive way to look at it
rather than like I have to get fit I
have to get to the gym it's like I I
want to love working out that's what
really got me going so it was really
more about convincing myself that I
could love fitness and I think that's a
great place and that everyone should
start there so start by recognizing like
what within your lifestyle needed to
change
I needed to first stop using food for
comfort I needed to stop comparing
myself to other people online and I
really needed to learn about nutrition
and health because I didn't know
anything I didn't know that everyone's
meanest afterthought and it unsaturated
fat and there's a difference if you
don't know that then google it I googled
everything for the first few months and
I'm googling everything now like Google
will teach you anything within the
matter of seconds so I just had a lot of
issues to work through at first and this
fall I kind of reached the end of that
where I was like okay I know a lot about
nutrition I made a lot of progress in my
fitness journey but now I'm kind of
bored with my routine and I wanna do
something different where I feel more
energized and more empowered by my
workouts because I'm kind of done just
doing like a thirty minute cardio sesh
and then we
like all right off with my day I wanted
to do something where I felt like the
gym was more my therapy and it was more
getting stronger instead of just like
maintaining the same level I wanted to
continuously strive for something so
with all that being said the background
plot has been laid let's talk numbers
and I hate numbers I hate weighing
myself I hate counting calories I hate
it all but there is a science to it that
is important and you have to kind of
respect if you want to lose weight truth
is that when I started losing weight I
would count my calories and I used an
app called My Fitness Pal and I would
log everything I would scan the barcodes
on everything and mainly what I wanted
to achieve when I did this because I
knew when I started this that I did not
want to comment about habits again and
get addicted to calorie counting and a
crazy obsessive order over like what I'm
eating and all that so I mainly wanted
to track my macros which is the balance
between protein and carbs and fats the
trifecta the three in your diet and you
want to have a certain amount of each
and there's like science online about
that that you can find and so I
basically wanted to keep like an even
pie chart of all three of those
throughout my day to make sure that I
wasn't eating too much fat or too many
carbs and not enough protein and so
basically just hope you keep track of
things like on the scale of health it is
important to keep track of things that
way and also train me to learn about
like what foods were helping me and what
foods weren't what foods were filling me
for the calories that I was consuming
for them and what wasn't
so the fact of the matter is that
there's a lot of science videos online
that will teach you about how to lose
weight I'm not really going to do that
I'm just kind of like sharing myself but
I but basically you do need to calculate
your BMI and how much you're resting
caloric whatever metabolism thing is in
a day so like how many calories you burn
in today when you're not doing anything
and then you know when you workout you
want to you're burning calories and so
basically I would reach for that
whatever my resting caloric thing was
and then I would say I was burning
around 300 calories doing cardio a day
don't get super super caught up in the
numbers because it's more about how you
feel so that's what I was doing to lose
weight and hypothetically yes it worked
is that the only way that you can lose
weight no I think that there's a lot of
other ways and a lot of other factors up
going to losing weight that I've talked
about in like my healthy habits video I
think that number one if you're looking
for my top top advice would be to drink
water
I'd give three liters a day and it makes
you feel amazing the reason I mainly
want to have this talk is because I want
to talk about my intuitive eating that
I'm doing right now where basically
instead of like counting calories I'm
more just being intuitive and so for me
I don't really like eating breakfast
lunch and dinner I like eating like
breakfast and then a big lunch and then
like a small small snack food and I mean
like a plate of vegetables for dinner
because I'm literally not hungry I like
doing that because that's what's
intuitive for me and I just want to
basically eat to fuel myself and to
basically also say when I work out I'm
gonna do updated workout routine I think
next week but I usually work out cardio
for about 20 minutes every day five days
five or six days a week and then I do
about an hour or more of weight training
so there is a huge difference between
losing weight and gaining muscle like
there's just like a huge difference and
you can't like the thing is that when
you lose weight like you don't get that
toned body unless there's pre-existing
muscle so I used to think when I lost
weight that I would have the body that I
wanted and I would have like the
perfectly hourglass figure but it's not
true from my body type because I have
such a long torso and it's so distant
from my thighs that it gives me the hip
tip so when I lost weight I still had my
hip tips so I was basically like I need
to build muscle in order to get a
rounder a butt that I want in order to
get the shape of an hourglass that I
want and at the end of the day I think
of the best choice that you can make for
yourself is the one that you feel
happiest doing you don't think about the
results that you're gonna get but think
more about like do you enjoy doing the
workout and I love doing my workouts
right now it gives me so much
satisfaction to complete like a really
strong workout and then go upstairs and
eat a lot and then I still get to see my
abs I still get to see like the muscle
my thighs come through I also know that
I will have my hip tips forever and that
all I can do is just build my glutes up
and I can't get rid of the bone
structure in my body so just learning to
love and accept what
and you know working for the best that I
can get because that's you know the most
positive mindset that you can have about
it and also so I originally mentioned
this video idea in a vlog which is why I
wanted to make it but in the vlog it was
a Saturday and I had a cheat day and
basically I don't really believe in
cheat days or cheat meals I just believe
in like treating myself on days that I
can and so you have to live every day to
its fullest potential
you know Drake Yolo you have to live it
up because we're just floating on a damn
rock in the middle of nowhere like
what's going on so of course if you want
to eat them like ethically made vegan
pizza or cake or something like that do
it you know if that's what's gonna make
you happy at the end of that day if you
think that resisting eating that and
focusing more on eating like some nice
veggie stir-fry nice healthy rice and
like potato medley or something it's
gonna make you feel the best at the end
the day because you want to feel nice
and clean on the inside at the end of
the day then do that do whatever is
gonna make you the happiest at the end
of the day like I for example pretty
much do that every day I want to eat
every day and eat every meal as if it's
going to serve the best for me so what
is this going to serve for you oh my god
I but I heard this in a podcast you guys
are the podcast that I told you about
create your own magic one of the girls
in it Rachael's she was saying that
before she eats every meal and I don't
always remember to this but when I do I
feel amazing she'll hold it up like say
she makes a full meal she said she'll
like hold it up and she'll say body does
this serve you right now and if she says
no then she literally just puts it away
she's like I just put it away I don't
eat it and I make something else and I'm
like that's crazy but that's amazing
because whenever I do that I'll be like
say I made rice and broccoli I'll hold
it up and be like body does this serve
you and sometimes hi brains like no rich
I don't want the carbs right now like
can you please just like drink some
water and then I'm like you bet you a
bitch I will give you some water thanks
for letting me know that's what you want
it like so really really asking your
body like what will serve you the best
right now and for the most part I like
to eat really well and clean throughout
the week because it's kind of my routine
I'm like a Hello routine person and then
on Saturdays I always always live my
life to the fullest and the wait the
reason I do this is because I just enjoy
looking forward to Saturday
I really enjoy going out with my
roommate and we go hiking and then we go
and get food and we just look forward to
it every week like we'll get excited
about it all week we'll look online for
restaurants that we want to go to eat at
and like financially speaking like we
probably spend so much money I think
this quarter because of this but it's
like doing it once a week it's okay it's
like a treat for yourself and eating bad
once a week like that like it's not to
say that I ain't perfect every day you
guys know I'm addicted the halo top like
the vegan dairy-free ice cream that they
have I'm addicted to eating like Clif
bars and Lenny and larry cookies like i
still up throughout the week but
you know for the most part I'm still at
the end of the day serving my body the
best that it wanted that day and so on
Saturdays I almost always want to serve
my body with just lots and lots of
treats but the next thing that I want to
say is that sometimes I get DMS where
you guys are like I just ate a lot and I
feel really bad and I all week long
maybe like I've been eating really bad
and I just feel really guilty about that
and I want you guys to know that
scientifically speaking I think it's
good to lean on science for some answers
because it gives you comfort and it
gives you like a method to fix things
where I was like sometimes mentally we
can't do it but science will come in and
we'll fix it for us does it make sense
I'm going to keep going anyway
scientifically speaking you gained one
pound of body fat per 3,000 calories is
about the right answer so basically in
order to gain a pound of body fat you
have to eat a lot a lot more than you
think
Oh 3,000 calories it's a lot so you
don't just gain a pound in a day it's
easy to gain a pound it may be a span of
a week or two weeks or I mean that being
said every time that you have a day we
eat really bad for example my cheat
dance Saturday I probably eat like 2,000
or more calories I don't know how many
but a lot like I would say we ate 3,000
calories yesterday my body will bounce
back right away the next day because you
kind of just have to drink water and
just kind of get back into your regular
routine and your body without stock and
I feel like it's good for my metabolism
on Saturdays when I have like a cheat
day to like reset my body and it like
really it forces I was how it wasn't to
work really hard and then the next day
it gets to go back to like clean eating
and so it's kind of like a nice system
for my body as well and
you eat a bad meal do not punish
yourself the next day by not eating or
by skipping the meal because that would
mess up your metabolism more always
always always even if you like a small
meal eat like a small dinner or like
something smaller you still need to keep
your metabolism on track that's what's
gonna be the healthiest for I have a lot
of friends that will you like a pizza
and then they will call my god I need a
juice cleanse and I'm like no it's so
bad for your metabolism so I don't want
you guys to ever have like a guilty
mindset about food because it's such a
terrible feeling to feel like you're not
allowed to eat because you messed up or
feel like you're not allowed to enjoy
life because you need to look somehow a
different way because like perfection
does not exist you guys but you know
just getting better at you know teaching
yourself the balance of life it's
something that I really recommend for
everyone
do we love that my video is all over the
place because I don't I wish that I
could have one clear conceptual video
for once in my life that is just
straight on track and make sense but
that's not my channel that's never gonna
be my channel feel free to leave down
below any other questions that you have
and I will be going through for the
first like day that this video uploads I
will be going through everything that I
can answer down below and just talking
with you guys and I love doing that I
always try and answer as many questions
as I can but for the most part please
please please please please always
always always only homies talk to your
doctor get your blood drawn get your
physical exams every year I am so
shocked by how many people don't get
physical checkups every year love
yourselves as you deserve to treat
yourselves as you deserve to and I think
being intuitive is really important eat
right and feel good at the same time not
one or the other so make sure that
you're doing that for yourself and it's
really crazy how my body has morphed in
the past year and how I told myself I
could do it and now I can because I used
to be so scared in fitness I used to
think like that lifestyle is never gonna
be for me all these people are strong
because they were born like that but the
truth is it's up to you to have the
power to craft your mind and craft your
body the way you want to you can like
you can do whatever you want to with
your body and understand that your goals
will take time don't expect in a month
or in a week to look your best I know we
got a little cocky after like one week
of working out will be the oh my god
my body is amazing and it is obviously
but you think that like oh I don't have
to work anymore like this is perfect
I've made all my goals in this week and
I don't have to try anymore but it's a
long-term thing so create a lifestyle
that you want to last for a long time
and that you think that you can keep up
with for a long time so if you have to
workout twice a week maybe you like when
classes to work out maybe you like just
doing like quick workouts in your room
at night for 15 minutes you know maybe
you enjoy going to the gym for two hours
because it's therapy for you like I do
find something everything works for you
and just give it your best shot and
don't give up on it don't physically
don't worry there's just too much about
what you're seeing in the mirror as a
result feel internally what your results
are and how you feel and just be
intuitive you know look into science
learning about nutrition it's really
interesting learn about food and learn
about the environment and how you
connect with just big green earth that
we are all breathing with collectively
I'm gonna go to my cameras going around
the space but I love you guys I hope you
have a great day and you feel free to
