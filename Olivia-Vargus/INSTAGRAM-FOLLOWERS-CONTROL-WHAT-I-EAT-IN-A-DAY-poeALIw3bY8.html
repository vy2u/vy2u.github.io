channel my name is live between you you
can see the red subscribe button today's
video is gonna be one of those I live my
Instagram followers control my life for
your day I thought of fun spin on it
with me to me I let my experience decide
what to eat and day since you guys
really like seeing those videos from me
think if you did vote in the polls
comment down below he did so that I can
heart your comment and say thank you for
warning before you see these first clips
I have just woken up and I hadn't had
any coffee yet trying to get off from
camera before having any was a struggle
but let's start with those clips and so
it's actually 10:30 pretty much my did
go to bed at 2 a.m. last night I hit a
better sleeping schedule so before I
have breakfast I always have coffee and
when I ask you guys if I should have
coffee or if I should have green tea and
I swear to God if you guys choose green
tea I might delete my channel to my post
this that it's kind of like if like I
had to be like let's go like I'm up
because I can't do this as early like
it's not okay so now I'm gonna wait
about 10 minutes use the meantime I'll
just sit and be alone with my caffeine
withdrawal I feel like that was like a
test of loyalty but you guys chose
coffee I'm actually so surprised but if
I do other people's polls for these
videos I always choose the thing that I
know that they don't want to do because
like I think you would make it more
interesting if they like how it should
be did so I just like to put a few ice
cubes because I don't like how it takes
forever to cool down and I drink my
coffee really fast so all that matters
is that I get it it's like a drinkable
temperature and then I like sounds kind
of like stupid but like I literally
chugged the coffee I've been addicted to
caffeine since I was like 10 so that's
why
so now I'm gonna ask you guys what I
should have for breakfast so I bought
the ingredients for both pancakes and
for smoothies so we'll see which one you
guys want to see you I let that one sit
for a while because I was just watching
Spongebob
okay so 67% of people said pancakes and
I couldn't agree more so let's go make
my pancakes but I make these three
ingredient pancakes and I used to have
them all the time if you watch like my
ole ole-ole
what I eat in a day videos nan vegan
banana pancake recipe one cup of oats 1
cup of soy milk third cup of flour
baking powder salt a banana and chia
seeds okay so I'm just gonna get rid of
like the majority of those ingredients
okay so all you need to do is put the
ingredients in a blender the mana low
medium heat yeah we can do this we can
totally do that so here's all the
ingredients that I brought together and
I have my nutribullet
so in order to get the right consistency
I just kind of kept eyeballing it and
you want the consistency to be kind of
thick because it should look like
pancake batter what the original
consistency was way too thin and I want
to put it on the comedian he like that
okay here we go the first one I'm like
so nervous look at my little pinky let's
check and see if it's ooh I love a good
nonstick pan Wow
we shoot how am I gonna flip that kind
of sat there a little bit longer but it
looks so perfect that I'm just proud of
the fact that it's like a perfect circle
and I didn't break it when I flipped it
okay so I'm going to cut up some
strawberries and another banana to add
its toppings right now too
right after I made this I just realized
this looks exactly like that side of
fruit that you get at Earth cafe so I
need to explain what I did so we're
basically because I had so much fat I
tried making the pancakes in two
different ways so this is obviously the
thicker pancakes
and these are the thinner ones so I'm
gonna add almond butter and fruit on top
of both of them and then we're gonna do
a taste test and see which is better
okay plating looks ten out of ten I
think the thinner pancakes look cuter
than these ones but Wow okay I like to
never eat with two utensils like why did
I bring two whatever I'm just trying to
look like I have my life together I
didn't take pics of them oh that was a
close call
I do wish that I had syrup and I do wish
it there was chocolate chips means you
tried our best here
okay so this is the thing one and then
this one yeah the thicker ones are a lot
better I think in the future though I
should have followed the instructions of
the website better and like actually
gotten our ingredients and like ratios
and ingredients I'm literally not hungry
you like that breakfast filled me so
much it's 2:00 in the afternoon and I
don't have any appetite for lunch but
I'll put the pull up now and then I'll
eat it like when I get hungry and then
at least the pole we done with the
options were a big salad or a BLT
veganized
bacon lettuce and tomato sandwich don't
know what okay so I'm gonna take the
results for learnt let's see what you
guys chose that was a close one it's 53%
and salad I'm not sure really happy
about that some without Hungry's but
waiting really it's not good on top of
my skin right now what whatever okay so
this sounds actually super easy to me
first ingredient it's gonna surprise a
lot of you
so I actually I'm gonna try eating an
avocado because if you don't know I'm
like intolerant like I'm not allergic
but like if I eat them I get horrible
stomach pains
so today win a challenge for both of you
and see if we can eat avocado because if
I die it's gonna suck so I'm just gonna
use the romaine lettuce that i got from
Whole Foods I
love romaine lettuce I mean like not
that much I probably comped out and I
sound like kind of crazy about it but
and then I got Tomatoes I think I'm
gonna use one whole Tomatoes and then I
also got this at Whole Foods it's an
avocado vinaigrette so I'm just diving
to all the puddle thing like real fast I
should definitely ease into this what I
liked about this is that there was no
oil added to it now I'm also gonna add
this time puffs from Trader Joe's into
it I have one that's like already opened
I like seasoning my tempo on the stove
with some like sesame seeds and a little
oil and some salt before cooking it and
putting it together but I'm gonna pass
on this all together tonight because
like this itself just looks good to me
I thought some Himalayan pink usual
huncles that I thought to me right hey
because it goes to my apartment trying
to get my love salt and the
dressing has salt in it too
but okay and then we have a thumbs up
it's just like cut a little piece of the
tempeh and do what happens if I tried
crumbling okay lastly let's just finish
her up with her thing and you know like
sample it before I put it all over the
salad dots a little spicy but yes the
dressing like pooped onto the salad oh
she's glowing
my camera's like on the tripod right now
so I'm just gonna like walk with you
guys over here so here's a close-up of
this salad this is the tempeh that I
added on top I think it was better if it
was seasoned but it's not and see the
dressing like hooked on it I'm so
nervous
you don't call right now what am i doing
to myself you know what the tempo was a
good idea because we needed something a
little bit more solid in here so
everything is so mushy but yeah I'm
gonna start anything Stella's more often
okay so I always drink a lot of water
throughout the day but I really need to
choose what I want my new water bottle
to know I either want to get a hydro
flask or I want to get a this crystal
water bottle that's so cool from the
site Boop both of them loving can buy on
the OP dough so I'm gonna ask you guys
andö because they just added this new
feature where you can pull people who
follow you
okay so I'm gonna put that on my story
I'm gonna copy the link and y'all let me
know what's when I should get tomorrow
okay so I bought a few snacks and now
I'm gonna ask you guys which one should
I have so I bought popcorn and I bought
some stuff to make a hummus Potter okay
so what the snack Wanda was literally at
a Thai for half an hour so I just sat
here like what do I do
it is the hummus platter that's my
celery sticks that have been pre-cut and
washed and I love this hummus because
it's really cheap and it has no added
oil to have the celery because I didn't
really feel like the carrots but I'm
also just gonna add some salt on the top
of my hummus because I'm kind of crazy
about salt right now I feel like once
you start getting addicted just salt you
like can't stop this ASMR is dedicated
to Allie because I miss you okay let's
get a little update here seven o'clock
and I am not hungry
I'm not giving up yet we still have
dinner and then dessert to get through
so for dinner
I bought ingredients for burrito bowl
which or I think my other thing was
gonna be pasta because I have some meal
prepped but that's so boring so I think
what I'm gonna make it is breathable or
a surprise I think if I put that like
people are definitely gonna choose
surprise like I would choose surprise I
might like order food or I might like
make something up in the kitchen
hi ever times it Oh 7:30 already we are
going to make a burrito roll cuz that's
what one fun is killing it so this is
super simple actually let me get using
video again I'm like eating things with
a bare amount of ingredients because I
just I hate cooking I say I'm making a
cooking video but we're gonna be reusing
the romaine lettuce we're gonna use this
frozen packet of rice from Trader Joe's
you buy them in a box set and then we
have salsa which is
Whole Foods and then we have this can of
black beans so I'm gonna start off by
rinsing these and I just realized
something I don't have a can opener my
can opener used to belong to Kiana I'm
going to find another way what if I just
like stabbed with a knife really hard is
that a good idea or a bad idea we don't
have any options here take the knife is
gonna break and then like hurt me in
some way you know what I have a tool kit
we could use I have a drill if you use
the drill it's like no okay okay you
know what I was really good at readable
I just really want to like have dessert
what if I pretend to eat degradable
would you guys be mad I wasn't even
hungry I gave you the ingredient list
okay so here's what I was gonna do the
rice in the bottom then a layer of beans
on top of it and then a layer of
shredded romaine lettuce if I was gonna
cut it up really really small and then I
was gonna put some avocado slices that I
had left over on top of that and then
the salsa on top of that and I'm
realizing now it would have been so
smart for me to buy a vegan cheese and
put that on top and I put it in the oven
for five minutes so the cheese and melt
on top of it so you know what you guys I
messed this recipe up so much I'm just
not going to make it like I'm just tired
we're gonna pretend that we did that and
you can just imagine post another story
and I'm gonna ask you guys what I shop
for dessert
okay I feel a lot better now but
especially God and I'm just ready for
some light relaxing time god I hate
myself sometimes so what we're gonna be
making is Chuck covered strawberries
that's what you voted for I gave you the
option of pencils or strawberries so you
can get any like dark chocolate this one
is yeah it's this one I don't know what
we're on here it says the RAM but it's
from Whole Foods and it's 70% dark
chocolate we're just gonna melt a square
in the microwave on its own it's really
strong but would you melt it it's like
fine so we're gonna we're gonna do that
enjoy just top part
okay cool 30 seconds check on it after
every 30 seconds my doughnuts getting
soft I love that I feel like I should
take like a minute and a half and then I
have our same strawberry smoothie s'more
day huh it's like not a lot well uh it's
burning me it's on my way look it so
whatever that brand of chocolate was
like it's actually hardening on the
strawberries the fact that I have acting
growing right here right now and I still
have like a matte lipstick on and take 8
