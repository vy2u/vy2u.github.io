back to my channel so today it's going
to be another one of those videos where
I just woke up drinking my coffee and I
literally have to makeup on I just
wanted to sit and like talk and be
really open and honest as you guys in
terms of parents because if I get all
like a makeup ready to do this video
then I'll just feel really gross about
it and like sleep about it so I never
want to feel that way on my youtube
generally no so I'm here to talk to you
guys off at life and life update what's
going on please don't pay attention to
how the coyly and gross I am I did put
moisturizer on because I was like I need
to look alive I literally look like a
shiny basketball it's fine it's a lot so
I want to have an honest job you guys
about where I'm at in my life right now
I hit 10,000 subscribers which is
amazing I want to say thank you that
everyone who's watching this video and
subscribe to me we're doing so well I
can't wait for this summer I'm going to
be uploading every Friday and Monday and
I can't wait to see the progress that we
make together I love you all so much
here's an electronic computer hug from
me so if you follow me on all of my
other social medias and if you don't my
app name is just Atlas Vargas for all of
it but you might have noticed that I was
just home on Cape Cod Massachusetts for
literally a month and I dressed like Los
Angeles and if you saw my snapchat story
I was really emotional when I was
leaving he thought that wasn't even a
fraction of how emotional I was I was
solving the entire morning and I just
want to talk so I'm not going to get a
mobile phone - because I have come to
terms with it but when I choose to go to
a school across the country if you don't
know I'm in Los Angeles Cape Cod is East
comes in Massachusetts I was super
excited and I was really buying side to
go by how weird it would be not being
with my family every single day like I
was used to growing up and I was one of
those like rebel teenagers where I was
like I'm going to go do this watch me
I'm gonna slay Los Angeles and my
parents probably heated that but I'm so
grateful like so so
grateful that I have such supportive
amazing parents that were so open-minded
to letting me do this
it wasn't an easy soon wasn't an easy
thing for me to ask from them took a lot
of convincing but I may be here I got
here I've been here like two years now a
long amount of time um but it's just
over time gotten harder for me which is
synced easier because I would get more
used to it but it's gone harder for me
because I become more homesick it is
done and so what happened this past
month is I graduated college hey two
years Soviets degree from fashion and
students on merchandising in downtown
Los Angeles I have a degree in social
media and my parents flew out to Los
Angeles to attend my graduation and they
were here for a week and then after that
we flew home to hip hop and I was with
them for about two weeks and I had a
really amazing time we got so much done
everything on my bucket list I got to
experience a lot of what I have been
missing out on rhythm is a year-round
school so you don't get summers off so I
have not had a summer off since high
school so I finally got to experience
like the summer on Cape Cod which is
really big deal so while I was home I
was really living in the moment I was
really just soaking in everything that I
could get I didn't want to think I was
literally like I'm not going to think
about the fact that this is all
temporary I'm leaving here just going to
focus all my energy I'm just having a
good time and then when it came time to
leave it I had to leave it all picked me
because I all like all the sudden was
like oh okay bad guys like I'm going to
go be alone basically like fly back to
Los Angeles and just not to you until
December even though we spent like the
month last month straight and when I was
home I spent a lot of time by parent I
was like I'm just going to spend time
with them because they mean the most to
me and I know that they must be the most
out of like anyone and like my closest
friends and so it was really hard when I
had to leave I was solving the entire
day I solved all the way up until the
airport and then I was like I'm not even
going to say bye because I can you guys
peace I'm because I just can't even talk
it was hard I don't recommend that kind
of feeling to anybody and it's like not
even one of those things recycle you
know it's a pretty grown-up it's like no
like this stuff and I think one of the
hardest things about me coming back with
that I was coming back to not being in
school so there wasn't structure there
wasn't distraction there wasn't anything
that I had like going on I'm coming back
to Los Angeles for a completely free
schedule until October and I could
easily get a job and internship
something to distract me I'm doing
YouTube every Monday and Friday and
that's like what I'm living for right
now I want to hang out my friends but
another life update thing all of my
friends don't live in Los Angeles
anymore they all live somewhere else in
the country and we should find I love
you guys and I still love like my
friendships that I have with them like
they're so super close even though
you're not even in Los Angeles with me
as Kiana's I remain in Keanu has been so
much time together got tired like
literally she deserves a award for
putting up with me because I'm so
difficult so not going to give a life
update on like what's happening live
like what are you just going to like
live on YouTube the rest of your life
so basically I got like two-year degree
in social media and I was like ooh
mmm life adulthood am I ready for this
no when I started for them I was like
I'm going to the school because I don't
want to go to a four-year school I want
two years and I want to be out in the
world because I hate sitting in a
classroom and learning I win from high
school I took all of my classes that I
could as independent studies and I would
teach myself the material I would sit
there with my book from the class no
future just me teaching myself because
that's the kind of mind that I have I
have a TV I cannot listen to the teacher
talk for three hours of lecture like I
hate it but it's just you know you just
kind of like the bullet you just got
into it get the degree so I finished my
two-year degree I was like okay well my
entire plan my entire life was to finish
this degree and go out into the world
not possible not happening so for them
decided that it would be appropriate to
offer a follow-up bachelor's degree to
the tier so the--it's degree so another
two years of school a
another two years of school with us
again so I never planned to go to school
after these last two years and I'm going
for another two years voluntarily why oh
my god so the program for the schools
actually looks really good look what I
want transferring from venom to another
College is just about impossible it's
possible but it's impossible yeah and I
was just happy because I am like this
I'm going to be used to this is like all
the coursework that I like and I really
wanted to do something with my life and
I think I want to emerge social media
because basically when you major in
social media I could take social media
and apply it to any field I could use
social media for medical I could do
social media for politics I seek to
social media for the entertainment
industry anything and so my thinking is
that I love food and I love being vegan
I love beauty and I love being
cruelty-free I'm going to have to figure
out a way to merge all of that together
that was a weird hand motion so like
doing social media for vegan and
cruelty-free companies also because this
is the boat that I'm in right now I also
love YouTube in branding myself online
so this is kind of the other boat that
I'm in so lastly I want to leave you
guys off on like how I'm kind of a
frustrating position because as I just
told you I have a lot of different
interests I have a lot of different
things that I'm fascinated in and that I
want to try out and that's kind of what
you do as a kid as you do interns and
you internship and you study fields and
careers and stuff like that but social
media is a completely brand new career
field it's literally so brand new that
with me like seven schools in the United
States offer as a major and so
understanding that you know the salary
level for social media isn't really
determined yet you can't really have
like four years of previous experience
for social media because four years ago
what was it it's basically a marketing
degree it's basically a public relations
and marketing combination so that's kind
of like the job fields that I am
qualified for and a big boat that I'm in
right now is that I'm like well I have
all this free time in the summer and I
don't know what I want to do besides
YouTube and like you hang out signs and
like fine maybe a teenager and little
eyes because I sure they got been a
robot for the past three years or two
years of my life I swear like everywhere
I turn there's like an opportunity is
like an internship and job offering like
people emailing me for this not and I'm
just like back off like I don't know
what I want because my issue is that I'm
so interested in everything like
submitting to wake up and I'm like I
want to have my own social media
influence or management company for
people who are like vegan and healthy or
something like that the next day I wake
up and I'm like I wanna own my own vegan
bakery like what every day I wake up
into something new pops into my mind so
I don't want to see the job and then
become uninterested in into a sandy
stuff of it because that's the kind of
person that I am so I know that I'll
figure out eventually I'm not worried
about it I'm completely I can be trust
myself and I believe in myself and I
trust the process you know but not to
say I'm not frustrated with the fact
that I'm just like like I need to keep
myself busy otherwise I'm going to end
up on a plane back home because I miss
my parents too much and I need to hang
out with them so yeah that was all I
want to come in this video I want to
talk about how I basically struggle from
severe homesickness right now I'm fine
because I've pushed it to the back of my
mind that is my coping mechanism I don't
think about it but when it comes down to
it like it's a sad song please it'll all
come out and it's ugly and nobody wants
to see it so that and then like my
career like what I'm doing after
graduation so I hope that you guys found
this video like a little bit interesting
thank you for listening to my demise
ramble for how many wrong minutes this
was seeing what English okay so I hope
that you guys found this video
interesting thank you for watching me
ramble nothing like this because I knock
you and I can't wait to see what happens
to summer I will keep you guys updated
like I said following social media I got
three advice Oh most of the information
about what I'm doing and love you all
stop monitoring claims do you want no
manager coming in here just love you bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
