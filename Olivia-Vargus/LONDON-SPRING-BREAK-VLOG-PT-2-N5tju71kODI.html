midnight to self-hatred
yeah we just a lot like being rich I got
mcslade but we slipped so much and the
breakfast ended I love it and yeah I'd
like to rest my sort of brown and so I
was like get out of here the view like
the aesthetic this is amazing like
honestly we didn't want to miss this
specifically because we knew that it was
like really cute so I'm so tired I
thought I thought would be here in our
hotel like on the 38th floor the window
I was thinking I wonder if we can see
our hotel from here where our hotel this
is the outfit that I bought at H&amp;amp;M
yesterday and when we woke up sweating
like I threw my hair in a bun and that's
well I'm was just dying that's literally
like we woke up to loot and this is also
to start to this new vlog I had that
little fun last night that we started
this out log legitimately looking like
 neither yeah so I don't think that
Liv and I would want to put this in the
vlog but I just want to like say
something something it's funny I don't
know if the party did I we were all out
of toilet paper and we had just gotten
breakfast when we both had coffee which
like everybody knows like coffee makes
you poop I mean literally just like okay
let's coin it tell you your first week
once you're back at the really like we
called to get toilet paper know that
yeah we'll send someone right away and
then like 15 minutes goes by and I'm
like I had to poop only got here and I
have to prove like really bad
and then at that point that was like I
have to poop really bad to live called
the Gavin was like we need to hold a
paper like now I literally had to poop
bad sheep Troy between paper at me maybe
he wanted I'm game youtubers watch me
over there go Ally now the toilet paper
like I literally chucked it at your face
Ali's letting me borrow this whole
outfit and like I'm literally obsessed I
kind of won like a literally go out and
buy a myself it's all from Free People
of course because she's the Free People
Queen
I never even like showed that we like
took the train to get here because I can
was just a train but we're at Notting
Hill and it's cute it's where all these
like houses are lined up and they're
like here in London they park their cars
facing those directions on the street
and it's weird okay so we're here like
in front of these three colored houses
you can see but basically I was gonna
take this clip because I just thought it
was funny that every single time Liv and
I take a pic so it's like
freezing here in London it's like 50
degrees like everyday choose to wear our
big fluffy jackets and like obviously we
have bags and so every time we take a
photo we have to carry all this off look
at oh this is literally every time we
take two jackets into purses they want
to do another ASMR segment
you guys javi and I are at the
internship and we just tried on wedding
dress it anyway one row say wait like
it's gonna fit so completely out it's
gorgeous
okay Wow last night was I definitely
don't drink often as we all have known
and I will go to nine am to the
housekeeper's coming in the room and so
this is pretty funny it's not really
that funny at all but so my bag was
found and they're sending it to London
which is should be so great but they're
sending it on a flight that actually
doesn't land until the time that my
flight to San Francisco two parts so
basically my bag is gonna be here and
I'm no longer gonna be here so that is
awesome obviously like I'm trying
everything that I possibly can to get in
contact with them and ask them to hold
it in San Francisco also I was just hung
Allie about how I think I'm getting
really sick in London yes I'm getting
thick in London it's okay so that
building right there oh it's really
pointy Lizzie told us that it's called
the shard and the only reason I remember
that is because it sounds like shark
it's now like 12:30 and I'm so hungry
remember Jack I don't obviously to go
out and then we're gonna go and get food
and then hopefully meet up with Lizzie
or just like head our way over to East
London we're trying to find Lizzie but
we found this like giant
indoor sitting I don't know where we are
honestly at all no one stops
that's chocolate shop ever there's so
many vegan options here like literally
everything is vegan like everything
wait are you absolutely kidding me
Aly loves chocolate more than anyone
that I know underling chocolate to be my
last meal wait it looks like dude this
is insane
she's saying this is vegan chocolate
why'd you go why you got your hood up
I'll eat you're blocking the shot I want
you to see my chocolate
I see it's very nice first thing I see
when I walk in this vintage store is a
Red Sox day yeah that's the Boston team
we're in a vintage store
I really love how much people in England
love carbs and last night it's like and
I asked my mom with my ancestry is and
I'm 50% English quote she is so I'm like
25% English or whatever that explains
why I love carbs you know much look at
all the carbs I just want to bite into
that loaf of bread you can this is the
first time I think we've been in the Sun
alleys no hardly found in it
okay the last thing on earth side that I
want is a falafel I swear the in falafel
like at least once a day in here I'm not
even kidding
place is fully vegan and look at how
cool it is here we go we got a massive
amount of food and I think that we're
gonna die oh the lighting is actually
really pretty right here we need take a
photo right here but look it oh sorry
live God let me foot let's make it focus
in a bubble waffle corner and say hi to
Lizzy she's taking photos so now we just
took an uber to Piccadilly Circus on my
time and it's so pretty and like lit up
so it's about 11 o'clock right now and
Lizzy left to go home and I forgot to
vlog saying goodbye to her but she was
amazing shout out Lizzy obviously like
we couldn't have had today it'd be so
fun and success without her
