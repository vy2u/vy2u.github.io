intro this log it's like 12 in the
afternoon we haven't eaten anything yet
if you haven't watched our storytime
about what's been going on up until
right now you should watch it
but we're in London right now we flew in
yesterday and last night we like went
out and they got dinner like dealt with
all the drama but my baggage and stuff
we're gonna get food and then we have
over bunch of other stuff to deal with
but yeah
okay so we ends up instead of at
Starbucks and we both got these bagels
that have almond butter and banana in
them so we're in this like shopping mall
and then we ate over there like over
there for lunch and this is what I got
at Starbucks to drink and it's just like
an iced coffee when they have milk thank
God they are still showed emotional
right now
look at how good smooth looks like me
good like all of this looks but I can't
eat it it's not vegan al you got two
lattes because she's so jet-lagged both
of us
I just gotta another wise when I got two
minutes ago from one place and then I
was like no any another one but this one
as well I just thought this one cloned
to Starbucks and like I chugged like a
venti and I didn't do anything so I got
this one
hey guys so we're back at the hotel this
morning was a complete mess in a rush
because we were so starving and we were
also really like caffeine withdrawal or
whatever so she wanted me to make a
video and say I'm sorry for being a bad
friend and putting this clip in here I'm
sorry I took me so long to tell you in
real life that day that you had
something on your lip I walked around
for like at least 40 minutes whenever I
asked for iced coffee they're like oh so
like in Americana and I'm live doesn't
know what in America so they keep giving
me an expresso shot with like water and
I'm like why are you getting stopped
watering down my coffee just for vanilla
latte and they go we don't have syrup so
now I don't have to explain this well
enough but Ali has an internship for a
really beautiful like bohemian bridal
company honors oh so we're here to help
them out with their like London Fashion
Week showing and everything so we're
going to that right now is an internship
and so I don't know how much I'll be
able to vlog while we're there but if I
get to do anything I will but yeah I
don't want to give you guys an update
and was our ootds what are you wearing
moti dee I'm wearing brandy melville on
top and free people on bottom I have on
my IMG because it's so cold out and all
my other dockets are on my check bags so
I'm gonna wear this again and then I

and like nice and then I have on my mom
jeans from Topshop and then these black
booties
from Steve Madden luckily I have this
all-black alpha because I have to like
be professional ish today oh yeah worse

London Eye from here but I don't think
you can see it on camera you can kind of
see the outline right there
so we're downstairs waiting for Ally
like print stuff for her internship and
we're gonna call it over to the place
that we have to meet them at and I'm
laughing somewhere I'll promise create
an Instagram for another just put up but
everyone knows that I lost my luggage
like on Instagram stories and so
everyone's commenting they like because
I'm not wearing anything the photo but
like my comforters that are like
everyone's commenting they're like when
you don't have any flipping because they
lost your luggage she just from the
comforter and then it is just so weird
or like when there's cars next was
driving I'm like there's no one driving
that car there's nobody the driver's
seat and I'm like oh they're on the
other side of the car
okay so we're back at the hotel and
unfortunately they still don't have my
bags I was really hoping that we came
back that they'll be here but still
hopeful they'll show up eventually
say hi Allie oh my god so we're at this
vegan pizza place called zzs that we
just uber it to and and it took on the
water you can see cuz it's dark outside
but I put it during the daytime to be
really pretty and they have a full menu
for vegans and he brought the garlic
bread out unlike this wood thing and it
looks so good oh my god it looks so warm
and heavy oh okay
yes literally my hands after touching it
are covered in oil
we got vegan pizza and it looks so good
and also the drinking age here is 18
yeah suck it up
 it up it up oh you know what
it's so early

2:30 a.m. you suffer for hours here to
wake up them like three alarms but we
have to be up cuz they have to leave at
8:00 to go to the internship for the
five hours right
she's being so annoying this way to shut
up
so now we okay so now we have the rest
of the day free we haven't decide what
we're doing because we both just need to
like relax sit down have coffee we
gather have a little food and then like
figure it out
I am currently on hold with Virgin
America because live is to put it
lightly having a panic attack because
they still don't know where her bags are
tonight so live and I just got to
downtown London she doesn't want to talk
to anyone right now because she's in a
really bad mood I made a video earlier
saying that Lee was having a panic
attack and it's like Loki still going on
currently we're about to go to
Buckingham Palace there's a bunch of
random people in the background
say hi random people I think or buy
Buckingham Palace I hope so because
that's where we were supposed to be
headed Liv and I are ranting about how
much we hate America okay we don't like
actually hate America but like we don't
like in America we have like the Statue
of Liberty and that's it oh it's golden
gates and she goes look at kinda legit
and I was like that is a legit fence
look at it
okay so Liv and I are finally at
buckingham palace or a pointing but you
keep on you to move it up so you can see
how
your finger is I'm trying to point times
may see him see he's walking back and
forth
dude like ASMR ASMR bro
oh wait so I need a positive gun we're
doing a lot of commentary I know that my
contents like kind of pg-13 but if
anyone's everyone have a forge I don't
endorse drugs I don't even smoke we do i
smoke weed alley no have you ever been
high before and like you've been around
like your parents and you're trying to
act like you're not high and you're
keeping your eyes as wide and open as
possible or around anyone like why do I
look like that in these clips how much
is like an American thing but like their
toilet paper here is a really rough and
heart and like thick like thick we
somehow just somewhat upon like a Rodeo
Drive
but like in London
literally thought you wanna be real
okay so we're back at the hotel
um with so having me vlog my hair looks
like I got attacked by an animal and I
just went makeup off which I wish I
hadn't have done because I didn't know
we were recording they wanted me to like
show you guys this so I knew H&amp;amp;M outfit
I want to give a big shout out to the
london english conversion rate for
 me in the ass because it was
fifty dollars here or i guess they
called me house but it was eighty
dollars us money free swatch and
the reason i started well here's the
reason we started vlogging us we've had
lips had a rough day lives on a rough
day and i just want to point out that
live just a drink very often i don't
drink it all like i'm not saying that me
like i'm a pg-13 youtuber but like I
don't drink like like we were just
talking about I was like I'm a dweller
like I do well on things and it's not
good like it's a bad habit
it just gets fixated on it so I'm not
fixed they don't affect that like my
luggage is gone it's just like so it's
just so much at once that I'm just
overwhelmed with it I'm like yeah we
wanted to say goodnight we might end up
