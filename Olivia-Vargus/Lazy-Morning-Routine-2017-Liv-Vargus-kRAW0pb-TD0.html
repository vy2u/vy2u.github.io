good morning you guys and welcome back
to my channel thank you so much for
spending this present moment with me
today I'm so excited to be showing you
what I do on a day of rest
or a day where I'm just kind of
recouping and re-energizing myself so
that I can tackle the rest of the week
I've been loving doing this on Sundays
but whatever day of the week works for
you I highly recommend taking the time
to have a nourishing breakfast and
spending time alone and just really
really focusing on being at peace in the
present moment so that you can work hard
for the rest of the week but this is
what I have been loving doing literally
every week I call it self-care Sundays
and I really value this time for my hair
I was really fortunate that it was
already curly and pretty healthy today
so I just added some dry shampoo and
conditioner this is the branch II put
dry shampoo in your roots and just work
it through this way it kind of absorbs
any excess oil you probably already know
the deal about dry shampoo but in case
you didn't it's great for days where you
don't want to wash your hair because
it's already pretty healthy and then I
add a drier conditioner didn't even know
this existed until recently but thank
God that it does because it's amazing
then I want to take a body shower this
way I can still feel refreshed for the
rest of the day because I don't want to
be a slug today I'm trying to still be
productive and showering always helps me
feel refreshed and like I can wake up
and now I'm so excited to be showing you
my skincare routine I've been using the
bio clarity 3-step system for a month
now to target my acne and provide
hydration to my dry and sensitive skin
and I have a promo code you can use and
I'll leave it on the screen so the first
step is with the cleanser which I found
so perfect for my dry skin because it's
gentle but still really effective bio
clarity is naturally derived in
plant-based which I love because most
cleansers and skin care products are
full of a bunch of chemicals and garbage
that I just don't understand
but bio clarity uses nourishing plant
extra
such as camomile green tea cucumber and
a whole lot more that I just feel good
about putting on my skin it's also 100
percent vegan and cruelty-free which I
value so much after I'm done cleansing I
always rinse with cold water and this
really closes the pores and creates a
smoother skin surface the next step is
their treatment cream which I put all
over my trouble spots in acne I always
get stress breakouts and I'm so guilty
of being rough on my skin when I get
anxiety which I'm so working on but the
treatment cream really targets the root
cause of breakouts with its light so
mold technology the best part about this
for me is that it helps even my skin
texture even after my acne flares and
then the last step to their 3-step
system is their restore moisturizer
Florrick's or floral locks I can't
really say it right but this stuff makes
you feel amazing and so we've rushed the
reason flora Lux is green is because
it's made with chlorophyll which is the
green pigment in plants that helps
convert light into energy and there's a
restaurant called creation in LA that I
love that serves chlorophyll water and
it's basically just really hydrating
it's such an la thing like we're
literally drinking chlorophyll water
we're so extra but I love that I finally
have a skin routine that I can stick to
and feel good about because I never know
which of my products are helping me or
not and this has been so fun to partner
with bio clarity on this video and show
you guys what I'm using to get natural
and nourish skin the last thing that I
use for bio clarity is their skin
smoothie which isn't a part of their
3-step system but I love using it to
finish off my moisturizing routine
before putting on makeup or in today's
case letting my skin breathe and
and then of course you have to brush
your teeth because girl we ain't nasty
so I always just go through Twitter
while I'm brushing my teeth is that a
thing for anyone else it's quite the
addiction and I'm really not going to be
doing much for makeup today I'm just
gonna start by putting on some
moisturizer I always moisturize after I
brush my teeth and then I'm gonna put on
my deodorant
pretty basic pretty typical and then I'm
going to draw my eyebrows because if you
know me and you know my channel you know
that I need to have my eyebrows on at
all time no matter what I'm doing they
need to be drawn in so then I really
recommend if you're not into essential
oils try out this peppermint halo oil
from my favorite essential oil brand
sage and I always put that on my neck
and around my back and I just kind of
massage it in myself this is sort of
like a numbing effect and it will cool
your muscle which feels so so good
you can also put it on your hairline
which is good for headaches not that I
had one but I just wanted to do it
anyways then my Clary sage oil is my
absolute favorite for calm and
relaxation it feels so so good to
breathe this in and just think of
positivity and then exhale negativity
afterwards and now I'm so excited to
share this with you guys this is a
podcast that I have been absolutely
loving it's by one of my favorite girls
that I follow on Instagram Alli Michelle
and I'm just gonna insert a clip here of
some of the things that they were saying
all credit goes to them and you guys
should really go check them out I'm
going to leave the podcast down below
but here's a little clip from them so
you get a feel for their vibe
so as you can probably tell from that
clip they're just really really
beautiful Souls and have the most
healing voices and energy and when I
listen to their podcast I really feel
like they've just welcomed me into a
positive space and they really are the
best to listen to in the morning each
podcast is like a little under an hour
long so I'll put that on and drink my
coffee and eat my breakfast and I find
it as such a better alternative than to
scrolling on my phone because I really
feel like at peace when I listen to them
and they've really taught me so much
about living in the present moment and
accepting all that is right now I could
go on and on about how much I love them
but please just go check them out their
link will be in the description and
you're gonna hear me talking about them
a lot more thank you so so much for
spending this time with me and I really
hope that you enjoyed your relaxation
day and I think other live that recorded
a sit down is about to talk now too so
bye hey babes so I hope that you like my
lazy morning routine so I've been doing
this a lot lately on some days I really
believe in having balance in your life
so I work really hard Monday through
Saturdays and then some days I like to
give myself the day off and this is what
I've been doing and I love it it gives
me a time to recharge and connect with
myself and just relax and rest is so
important that you cancel a and work
hard for this for the week you guys give
