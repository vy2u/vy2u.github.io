today I'm going to be showing you my
morning routine I started every morning
right away with a cup of coffee before I
even open my eyes
and I also drink an entire liter of
water right away in the morning just
kind of cleanse my body organs you feel
me I know you do
okay so I always have the same coffee
every morning it's the dark roast from
the donut shop and then I add a few ice
cubes to it and then I like to sit down
and write in my journal I know a lot of
people you know they wake up and they go
right on their phones but I've started
to make it a habit and this is I think
it's week two of doing this we're
instead of being on my phone I just sit
down and I use my journal and I write
about my expectations for the day how I
felt the day before and it's been so
therapeutic and it's really not as hard
as I thought it would be to give up my
phone in the morning but it's been so
helpful and for breakfast I have these
prepackaged almonds from Trader Joe's
and I like to they're prepackaged even
though it's kind of annoying it's like
extra plastic it's good because I can
portion myself otherwise I'll eat way
too money and then I like to cross
things off my to-do list right away in
the morning so I started off by checking
my to-do list for the day and then I'll
start doing work or homework or editing
videos uploading videos whatever that
day need whatever needs to get done on
time and then I don't like to really
hesitate for too much longer
I like to get up and get ready for the
gym my leggings are my gym shark
leggings my sports bra is from champion
and my hoodie is from forever 21 I also
always bring a small blender bottle to
the gym with me and before the gym I
have the woman's best pre-workout
booster and crazy fruits and during my
workout I have the BCA's and these just
repair muscle while you work out and
then I have my beats headphones you know
I can't live without my headphones and
then I have a resistance band and heavy
for my warmup and I'll link my workout
routine down below if you want to follow
it in depth but today I'll just show you
the general basis of what I do which
starts out with 15 minutes of
car do I like to walk uphill just to get
my muscles warmed up and I do that for
15 minutes and then I stretch and get
into my glute activation so this usually
takes me about 15 minutes to do I try
and keep it around 10 minutes just cuz I
like to get through my workout really
quickly and this is all sped up you want
to make sure that you're going slow and
you have controlled movements but this
is what I do to warm up my glutes I do
the same exercise on each leg usually
about 12 on each leg and this is just
kind of what gets my body ready for
lifting heavy weights and since I'm only
working out in my apartment gym today I
just used the cable machine and some of
the things behind me but I forgot to
film any of it and then I got on the
elliptical for another 15 minutes on a
full incline and that was kind of like
using a Stairmaster and then after you
workout you want to try and consume
protein usually ideally within 30
minutes so I'm gonna make a protein
shake and you don't always have to blend
it this protein powder you can actually
just put in a blender bottle with some
almond milk and shake and it will be
fine but I wanted to make a banana one
so I put everything into the blender and
protein world just sent me their new
slender vegan blend of protein powders
and I put half a serving in so that's
one of these two scoops just cuz too
much powdery drinks I don't know that I
just said but it just doesn't work well
with my stomach and it tasted okay you
know it got the protein job done but now
it's time to find the it ready for the
day so you know my shower routine that's
also up on my channel I will link it
down below and here's what I use to
brush my teeth and I used for deodorant
cuz I'm not gonna show that on camera
and then I'm gonna do my makeup let me
know if you want a full makeup routine
but this is an overview of all of the
products that I'm gonna be putting on my
face today and that I pretty much put on
my face every day and have just been
using for a while now
and then I want to do my hair so I'm
going to use the dry shampoo from cry
bar which I love Tresemme heat
protectant and then my dry bar
straightening iron and I'm just gonna
freshen up my hair so that way I can
wear it down today and it's all pretty
self-explanatory I also like to brush
the product through my hair before
straightening it and that is it guys
