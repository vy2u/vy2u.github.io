finally gotten I don't look the best
right now I just got home from class so
I am in shock
nervous a lot of emotions at once today
is the day before I move into my new
apartment I feel a lot of things at once
this is Zayn I've lived here for two
years in downtown and I've talked about
moving out of downtown for so long now I
never thought that like this day would
actually come my mom flew in from town
from Cape Cod and she's been helping me
but she's been so helpful like I don't
think I could do this without her this
is so weird to me so we obviously have a
lot of boxes and everything is
everywhere cuz I guess it got I guess it
kind of has to get messy before it gets
cleaned again but we're just organizing
everything taking everything apart
I think the dishwasher is running right
now so you hear that so we got a lot of
stuff packaged last night pretty much
everything in my drawers and in my like
closet but we still have a lot to go and
right now it's about three or four
o'clock in the afternoon because I had
class today and I got really lucky
yesterday my class was cancelled so I
didn't have to go so I got a lot more
done yesterday than I had expected to
and now I'm pretty much free until
Tuesday because it's Memorial Day
weekend which I'm also so lucky about
because I don't have to do anything
until Tuesday so I have until then to
pack and then unpack and buy new stuff
wait I wanted to show my mom how
comfortable the IMG ID Jack it is
because it's less you look like me
somehow so we realize that I don't know
how to pack my makeup up so we're gonna
go by like a ziploc bags and like throw
all my makeup into the bags because I
just like don't know how to like pack
like this like what like I own I don't
know you guys know like how much makeup
I own and just like I think we're both
starting to get a little bit like
nervous because we have like only the
rest of the night to pack but it's like
7 o'clock now he's got back food I look
terrible I kind of got anxious and
picked apart my face a little bit and a
face of this so the movers are coming at
8:00 a.m. tomorrow so we have to have
everything packed by 8:00 a.m. tomorrow
so I basically eyes have to go to bed
tonight
so I get so discouraged I think it's so
discouraging that like even though
you've been packing for hours
it doesn't look like my room is packed
up at all the gloom just looks really
really messy but I just packed up all my
makeup I still have to pack up like all
of my clothing and I'm just starting to
hit a wall I can imagine my mom it's too
she's been doing this all day long I did
have class and yesterday we were doing
this I'm just getting not so over it
okay so we're actually almost done now
this closet is completely done and
what's left in here is just stuff that I
want to come back and like sell on my
Poshmark because like I don't want to
donate it cuz some of it like stylist
hogs and is really nice so I have like
since that stuff the shipping stuff and
then a giant box of two-faced foundation
I don't know what to do with it they
still have this apartment in a lease for
another couple weeks like I the lease is
up like a week into June so I have like
two more weeks here so I have time that
I'm gonna be coming back downtown for
classes so I have time to come
downstairs so the new update everything
oops I can't get that open everything is
completely Matan there's still stuff in
here because we're just going to
transport it like that but all of these
are empty that's empty cause it's empty
bathrooms empty obviously keanu stuff is
still here she's not moving for another
week here's all of our stuff
I woke up this morning at 5:00 and I
come from back asleep so I just sad my
phone words turned business emails that
I've been avoiding here my goal is for
the day one don't eat any of the cookies
that my mom brought me for breakfast
like I did yesterday because it would
may feel like all day
my other goal is to boom by the Reverend
safely and go who's anything don't read
anything it looks like I just moved to
an like I just put all this in here I
just remember like one thing that I'll
say is like I remember moving out of
student housing and living here and like
the day that I moved in I wasn't alone
Keanu was at work and I saw on the
ground I think it was like right here
like I sat on the ground and I just
looked around and I was just like in awe
I was like this is my very first
apartment so we're in the process of
taking everything out of the apartment
the movers did show up I didn't update
you on that but go back upstairs to give
me my keys and then we're gonna drive
where's my place so now it's 10:00 a.m.
and this is the final goodbye
just kidding I'm coming back to like do
other here but so we are basically
headed over now the movers have all our
stuff and now I just have to drive there
and meet them there and it's like 10
a.m. now I'm like so nervous so I need
six super meat and tell me what I'm here
because she's singing at a hotel nearby
so she's just gonna drive over when she
gets here obviously I'm gonna show you
like an empty apartment store right now
I'm just like I have white bedroom wall
oh my god I'm so happy right now I
literally could I need my roommate to
get here so that she can see this and be
excited with me okay so my roommate has
never seen the apartment before it was
my job to find the place and like relay
the information to her the best that I
could so she has never been here before
she's seen it in videos and pictures and
I've tried my best to show it to her but
she's never seen it in person so I seen
you text her to come here because like I
need her to see it too and make sure
that she loves it so I'm still really
nervous until
seize it okay a lot is going on right
now I don't even know how to
continuously update you but before they
move my stuff and I want to give you the
empty apartment tour
I feel like typically people don't move
their stuff in right away
but this is just how it's working
because we don't have time to like wait
a day to move it in because my mom's
only here for like three days so let me
do an empty apartment or a real quick so
right when you walk in the kitchen is to
your right and it is that's like
u-shaped everything's like really modern
and like I love that we have a ton of
storage now because I didn't have that
before guys look at the refrigerator
this fridge is so nice like oh my god
I'm so excited about that
like that's giant so now we have the
living room so it looks like there's
like a little utility closet right here
and then the living room is this giant
open really Airy nice space like this
place is so big so then as a part of
Durham because a little bit smaller than
mine she's gonna take this office space
- and this closes so I'm sure you like
when it and then it has built-in office
furniture and so she's gonna make this
like her makeup room in her office so
then her bathroom is right here across
the hallway from her and she gets the
bathtub and turn these lights on so
trying to figure out all the lights and
stuff in here but yeah so this is her
room or her yet this is a room this is
her bathroom then we have a washer and
dryer in unit thank God
I mean it wasn't super inconvenient
having one on the floor of my apartment
building but it is still like def a
bonus so then the two bedrooms so one
right here and then one right there and
then there's just like Center Council
thing I really know about anything with
that we have one of these nest things
but okay I don't know how to turn it on
or what to do okay so this is her
bourbon so she has these really cool
built-in like wardrobe closet things I
don't have to explain it but like all of
her stuff is like built into the wall
already which is good she's not
by a dresser okay and then I don't have
too much time to do this again but this
is now my bedroom a lot of natural good
lighting I have a walk-in closet right
here which is amazing I'm speechless
about this literally speechless like oh
my god never had a walk-in closet my
life and then here is my bathroom which
some people have seen on my Instagram
stories already I literally don't know
how to earth lights there we go if I
have a really nice step in shower and a
double sink so it's now about 12 in the
afternoon the movers finished everything
is in the apartment um my roommate is
here but she just left to go by her bed
because she doesn't own a mattress yet
so I'm gonna introduce you to her later
because we were so overwhelming the
movers were here and while she was
moving in so all of her boxes are in the
apartment now I'll show you what we have
set up so the movers moved everything
into the respective rooms that they go
into so my mom is hanging up everything
in my closet right now and then the
lighting looks blue when you're facing
this way but let me turn around this is
where all sit and do my makeup in the
morning because all the natural light
comes in through this window and then I
have my bed here I have a bureau here
I'll probably get like a TV or a mirror
on top without something to go on top
you just talk about how good the
fighting is like I know I already had a
freakout over it but it's gonna be it's
gonna be so much easier to film videos
and have good natural lighting so right
now I'm so hungry and I just wanna I'm
also really there see I didn't bring my
Brita filter here because I didn't want
to leave Kiana without one but I want to
go get water and food and so we're
waiting for the cable got to come when I
tell you like that last hour was like
intensive it was so intense like I had
so much going on I was like my brain is
like spinning in circles like I just
need just settle I think that I'll feel
settled like tonight when like it's just
me and my roommate in the department and
like all of our parents are kind of like
out of the way and we were just like
relaxed and then I can like sit and soak
it
but right now I literally feel like my
head spinning a million like different
directions maybe like right there or
something yeah I don't know so I took my
mom to the bed you girl and she's never
been you before she ordered an avocados
host and I'm so mad at her cuz she could
have tried something good something new
I got the beyond me burger what am i
doing I'm like talking and like being on
there I got the vme burger I'm serving
and I've eaten all day so are at this
urban because they have a giant Urban
Outfitters home section so I'm going to
look around I look so gross right now
this is just a theme I can't even get
over it I don't want to like keep
apologizing for it so what we've been
doing a lot say that I've kind of
forgotten to vlog we've just been going
for different for different stores we
went to a furniture store got a couch
but the delivery date isn't working on
those seven days so we're waiting to see
if we find another one that we like that
we get sooner but now we're in target
and I just picked up like a brand-new
Keurig and just like other random
and I'm like ready to go home and just
keep unpacking because we really didn't
unpack that much and we have a lot but
that's like 12 hours to packaging I can
really imagine it's gonna take that and
more to unpack it all because we don't
know why anything's going just yet so
we're gonna go probably get dinner and
then go do that
a pace in my mom and I both got the
classic people's and she's not sure if
she's gonna like it and I told her I was
like so many people would kill to try
these because it's all I talk about
little progress update the closet is
pretty much unpacked and now I'm gonna
get started on the makeup and that's the
most entertaining part because I don't
know how to show you guys this but I put
everything into bags and there's just
like a lot there's two layers of bags of
makeup and that's oh it's stressing me
out right now
shout out to my best friend Chloe from
home for sending me these housewarming
gifts these are really nice like marble
posters and then this is a gray flannel
candle from the Chesapeake Bay
collection smells so good
so I'm kind of like lost for what to do
next I need to wash my sheets to put on
my bed it's not bogus
pretty sure that the closet is now
officially done I'm not sure what's like
in these belts okay and a whole lot
going on now kind of put this stuff away
I'm gonna start doing my hair in the
bathroom I think that stuff down there
it's a couple bunch of oh this is MD I
got this soap from Target it smells
really good I'm just kind of like
putting stuff everywhere my showers kind
of unorganized but I'm okay I'm kind of
I'm gonna see how this works out if I
need to buy like a secondary storage for
my shower I can but I kind of just
wanted it to sit on the ground like that
like that I'm gonna care I'm so excited
we bought a new Keurig it sounds so
different it sounds so much smoother
like even the buttons they're just so
much sleeker the last character Sheen I
owned for two years and before that it
was Healy Webb she owned it for like a
year before that and her family owned it
for like a year or more I don't know and
I had never once like changed any filter
or anything in it I feel like it was
really time to just buy a new one so I'm
excited about that and you'd like to
invest in peace I'll have that for
forever
well not for forever I think I've
learned they definitely have an
expiration date but how's that for a
long time and we stocked the fridge with
the necessities
Lucroy and water and I'll milk on
swimmin ah my favor
it but we bought bottled water which I
kind of hate doing but we needed water
because I didn't bring the Brita over
here this morning as a mistake so other
than that I think that the only thing
that needs to be done is my bed for now
for tonight because everything else is
like put away at besides at my makeup
box my bed
yeah like the main stuff is put away
like the closet is done and the bathroom
is done and so tomorrow so I'm so sad
you wake up tomorrow because tomorrow
we're gonna go on an Ikea Ronnie love
like you and it's really good asking you
please
your buddy we just had outside hue but
too much food and we're gonna buy like a
nightstand and a mirror and some fake
plants and stuff like that and I'll
introduce you to my new Murray tomorrow
because we didn't get to today yeah
because we're just on two different
paths of getting stuff right now because
she's buying all new stuff like she had
to buy mattress today in a bed set so
she's been at furniture stores on I was
I went to like Target and stuff and
because her mattress isn't coming in
till tomorrow night I think she stays
the hotel but I obviously let her know
she can stay in my room in my bed but I
think she just wants to stay at the
hotel it was my parents for one more
night if you liked this video and you're
excited see my roommate give this video
a thumbs up and I will have the next
vlog up hopefully as soon as I can so
that you guys know the big announcement
of who live in LA because I kind of
regret like magnet announcement not just
telling you guys but I thought it would
be fun but instead it's kind of just
stressful because like I have to plan a
review and I don't want you guys like

surprised comment on below who your
