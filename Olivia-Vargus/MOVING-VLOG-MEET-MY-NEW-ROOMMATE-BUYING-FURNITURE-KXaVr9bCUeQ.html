downtown a my roommate is at her hotel
because she does have a mattress here
yet my entire collection and a little
bit of extra space for more button
and early slice is the freaking out it's
8 a.m. so excited about today oh my god
I'm actually also really sad because
it's the second last day before mommy
issues tomorrow night so we have all day
tomorrow which I want to do something
not moving related I just wanna like
hang out and spend quality time with her
because this entire trip we've been
moving so what today we're gonna but I
can't love my kid okay I love it yeah
everyone's like yeah it's like not an
uncommon thing like and I needed buy
things obviously we don't even have
anything in the living room and then the
coffee's ready
coffee's ready wait you know my channel
you know I put ice in my coffee
do I have a suede oh we do
okay bitch yes okay I can't pause the
camera because my hand is holding it
yeah that's fine that's that sign so I
need to buy a new comforter cuz this one
is just so gross but then I'm like dang
it's just gonna be so plain in here but
I know that if I add accessories so I
think I want a big potted plant over
there and then I want a nightstand just
right there I don't know if I want one
on either side I don't know what I'll
find today if I like them I'm gonna buy
the makeup like organizer and put that
over here probably with all this makeup
like this is half like there's a layer
underneath the one that you're seeing
with my makeup and then I want to get it
TV here I think I wasn't sure about 101
yesterday so I just looked at them and
then I'm thinking the outfit of the day
mirror here or outfit of the day mirror
there ooh this is the kind of a trickier
that's the trickier question we'll
figure out later because the movers put
this right here but I can move that
anywhere I want to
everything else is gonna stay where it
is so like this is all going to kind of
stay where it is the closets a
completely done like I don't think I
need to buy any storage for it I thought
I don't need to buy a shoe storage but
all my shoes fit right there I'm gonna
use this face mask because I can't find
my face moisturizer so I'm gonna use a
face mask as a moisturizer today so my
camera died and I realized that I'd left
my charger downtown so I'm gonna get
that later but I just finished getting
ready and Ali what are you doing here

gonna try and drop my phone so today I'm
really but I just think my mom in

we're gonna have so I didn't talk
anything in the middle of Ikea because
it was so hectic and we were like trying
to figure out what to order and by him
we're trying to pick stuff out and it
was like really overwhelming so we
picked out a dining room table and
chairs and then I picked out stuff from
my room so I'm just gonna get the rest
of the mom series for my bedroom until
waiting for Ali to me is in this hallway
too got these mirrors no no this is
gonna fit my car so we're gonna just
ship it which is annoying
I like the mirrors at least but now
we're all getting really hungry I said
1:30 okay Ali and her mom and my mom and
I I didn't vlog anything here like at
all work for him I also still bloody on
my phone so my my camera but like I
don't even miss out on these memories if
she actually had a camera and my camera

want a sandwich like oh like a really
good like panini sandwich type thing so
we had a say last night my mom loves
this place in there

at look at the color what a good
southern ice yeah you have it a little
try dots so Oh how high-tech how 2008 it
matches this charging my camera oh I
don't want to mess this up at all so I
can start working on that again but so
we have the mirror and the plants and
just a ton of stuff I don't know these
are tables all set up and it looks so
good and we have a mirror set up and
who's all these boxes are gonna bring
down to her right now
think we found one but now we're trying
to figure out what coffee table does and
this place is called living spaces in LA
and like we don't have the room maker
you doing up we don't want to make more
dough in trip alley you know we do want
to recreate the elevators no no no we're
in the elevator and let me just go we
get an elevator right new kidiots
because we have all my yeah we had
almond and we were like struggling
really hard but it is for two girls to
curate and there's other stuff that's in
my room now be in whatever anyways when
the elevator
and we stopped on that we were in the
garage when we stopped on the first
floor and then we I was like buck
there's people getting in and then they
get in and there's these two cute guys
who get in and they're like oh hey we're
on the same level is you and I'm just
like oh that's funny right we just moved

good I need switch over to my vlog
camera because this iPhone my mom back
downtown and it's driver they're very
tired it's almost 11:00 11:00 I'm
listening to ASAP Rocky's new album I
didn't even know that it came out
because I've been too busy and it's so
so so good comment down below if you've
listened to it what your favorite songs
are also listening to Shawn Mendes so
comment below your favorite songs from
that album to Al he's still not staying
here because she doesn't own bedsheets
yet so she's gonna try and get them
tomorrow and again like she can stay my
better if she wants to but like I think
she just wants to spend time with her
parents while she can and I so don't
blame her so I'm gonna listen to this
album and unpack everything in my makeup
drawer that way
all done and tomorrow I'm really hoping
that we can have a really relaxed day
with my mom and without these parents
and just way more chill not that we've
picked out the couch which is getting
delivered tomorrow and a lot of other
things I'm in a new world right now I
just can't process this I literally feel
like I'm staying in a hotel and like
someone's gonna come and tell me like
okay it's time to go home like you don't
actually live here I'm so grateful and
that's what I can't wrap my head around
I can't wrap my head around all the
things that I'm grateful for and it's
kind of like overwhelming and then I
always know that every time I mama
leaves I get like separation anxiety or
whenever I like part for my parents
because just like the whole thing it's
just hard I don't know what I'll he's
gonna have to say goodbye to her parents
too not gonna be really hard for her
because this is like her big move she's
moved to LA and left before it's like
she's done this before but it was a
while it was a or two years ago so yeah
tomorrow's goal is to make women thing
didn't have a lot of fun make memories
and relax and not pack or buy anything
for the apartment and just show and let
her know that she's loved
