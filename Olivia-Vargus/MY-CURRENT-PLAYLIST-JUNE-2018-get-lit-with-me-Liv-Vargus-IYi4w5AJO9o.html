channel I hope you're having a good day
today I'm going to show you my June
playlist I don't use videos just about
every month so feel free to subscribe if
you want to by the way this is the first
video that I'm sitting down and filming
in my new apartment so I'm still working
on my background decoration and where to
film in the room but for today this is
what we're working with by the way thank
you guys so much for all the support on
the moving blogs AHA those playlist
linked below if you want to go see them
if you haven't yeah and thank you for
all the birthday love I really
appreciated that you guys are the
absolute best of you guys
another quick disclaimer before getting
into the video my eyelash extensions are
all falling out because I just was so
busy the past two weeks I haven't had
time to go get a full fill so instead of
getting a fill it's been so long and so
I'm just gonna wait another week for
them to mostly fall out and then I'm
gonna get a full set so for the next
week you're gonna see me without
anything like eyelash extension eaten as
always comment down below what your
favorite songs are right now so I can
add them for playlist so without further
ado let's do this ASAP Rocky's new album
is everything to me I don't hear a lot
of people talking about it though
because I think Kanye West has stolen
the spotlight but you need to listen to
a sound Rocky's new album his music is
meant to be listened to I'm like full
volume so I have a few favorites from
him but this is my top favorite
okay yeah that song it's it's just
really good it's kind of long but it's a
good song Shawn Mendes also came out
with a new album and of all the songs in
the album but this one's my favorite
I'm not saying I can hit those notes but
I'm saying in the shower I try to
okay
whatever if I not good guys boy you
Tommy
say yeah
okay I think everybody at this point
knows that this song on the album is the
best one I don't know what my opinion on
Kanye West's right now I didn't really
pay attention to the media scandals that
were going on because I have been in
school and really busy with moving but
feel free to enlighten me on it below in
a play way
yes this is another old song from Rex
Orange County I played him before
methods videos I helped lead this one so
shoes what about me
what about being
every
I'll be
like hey sorry I think my grandparents
watch my video is some time so we're
gonna skip past that and then I couldn't
help but include a couple more songs
from the ASAP Rocky album this one the
beginning of it gets stuck in my head
and it's weird wouldn't stuff in your
head because if you sing it no one knows
what you're saying cuz it doesn't sound
like a song but just imagine this so
this is how it goes and then imagine me
like seeing class like singing it
so obviously the kids he goes album just
came out literally yesterday but I
haven't had time to listen to the whole
thing through I just pulled one of the
songs from the album that I like but I
need to listen to the album or so
kampala what your favorites from another
so that I can go and listen to me
shining on me
cheyanne right
Lyle
those shining light
so it was obviously a much more chill
slot and things on but I want to say
thanks for watching this video if you
liked it please give it a thumbs up
helps me out a lot and leave a comment
below what if your song was thanks for
sitting through my cringy dancing I know
you're gonna get when I point out that I
think my dancers cringy you guys are
like girl have more confidence but like
sorry like oh I'm okay with that I
wouldn't make these videos if I didn't
like making them but like I know how bad
would answer I am so anyways love you

day and I'll see it bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
