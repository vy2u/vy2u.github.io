my channel my name is live and today I'm
going to be talking to you about my
period routine and surprise surprise I'm
going to be making it a vegan period
routine because why not so I feel like
what a lot of people make these videos
they're almost always sponsored by a
tampon brand mine is not sponsored I'm
can you guys all of my secrets to
surviving my period we're trying
currently on so these are all very
relevant to me right now which is what I
wanted to make this video and I also
wanted to spill a little bit of here
free rides on the tampon industry if
that's like what you call it I don't
know of the correct terminology the
personal hygiene feminine hygiene
industry I'm coming for you guys so
without further ado I'm gonna jump right
into this video and I'm going to start
it off by talking about what eminent
hygiene products I use so if you've seen
my other videos you guys know I've
talked about these tampons so many times
and it seems a bit target and the name
of the brand is actually something I
can't figure out
it's called you organic cotton tampon
but they literally don't have a name if
you want to check out their website it
is this is Elcom I don't know if that
dance floor so tampons are my choice
item when it comes to my time of the
month but there's also a lot of other
options a lot of people like the diva
cos there's period underwear and there's
also reusable pads that you can get I
hope for tampons just because is what
I'm most comfortable with and I like
these ones because they are 100% cotton
there is no chlorine or synthetic or
chemicals or anything my tampons
growing up I use the same brand my
entire life it was a plaintext brand and
I found out that they actually test on
animals which is insane to me so I want
to show you guys that if you don't know
already go online and Google what tampon
brand and what brands you use and see if
they have fun animals so I will leave a
link below to Peter's article and the
cruelty-free bunny article and you guys
can read about it there too but
basically there's a lot of companies
that test on animals and I think that's
so crazy like this is
in hiding and I can't believe that they
were somehow tie-in animals to this so
these are 100% pure cotton okay and I
also use these liners which are the
brand Vito which I picked up on Amazon I
just literally looked up on Amazon
natural organic cotton liners because I
like to wear these at many times I don't
really need a whole tampon at nighttime
by the way you think that this video is
TMI I don't really care I'm just showing
you what I do on my period
half the population gets their period
it's not a big deal um we all going to
survive this thing together you guys so
that's I'm here to help you like get
through so next of course it's not a
period without some cramps I got really
bad cramps leading up to my period like
literally the day before
aka yesterday was just held for me so
what my ass would go through in my tall
this is what pretty much everyone uses
you can get it at like any drugstore and
I just think that this works best for me
they are for cramps bloating fatigue
backache and hay bloating also I think
it is also really helped my bloating
which is achieved after in my period so
I love that and if you're an awesome on
that is really into taking drugs or any
sort of thing like that I got you
because I also have this special oil
which I picked up from this place in
Malibu but they are a rich inner
Canadian company and they have retail
locations all over the world but you can
also purchase this stuff online so I'll
link that below but it's just company
called I think it's stage I should ask
the one of their I've pronounced it but
this is their transition on essential
oil rollerball so I clearly do the store
I was like I have green head cramps and
really bad hormonal lose things on my
period
do you have anything for like stress
relief and she was actually like what we
have to attend to order this completely
made for those issues for your
registration so what I do is I use the
roller balls apart and I roll it
basically she set on to your lower
abdomen so
where your ovaries are and just put
little amount on so the second thing
that I do with this is that I use the
rollerball and I put it directly on the
middle of my hand and I rub my hands
together and she said that whenever I'm
trying to feel like stressed or anxious
to cut my hands and to smell them and
not way I kind of breathe in the
essential oils and it creates an
immediate effective relaxation
and I definitely feel the relaxation
after I do that and so I keep this in my
purse and I carried around the last
thing that I do with this is I put it
into an oil diffuser which you can get
them off Amazon they stole from there
you can get them anywhere if you want
like a cheap one I will say go to Amazon
but there's also some really cute
high-end ones that they sell but I have
it in the background right now and
basically you open it from the other end
and you can then use this and to use
drops and you put it into the oil
diffuser and it will diffuse into the
room so yeah I really like this it smell
it just relaxes me I don't want to like
describe the scent so maybe should go
online and agreed the product
description you'd understand it more but
I definitely recommend if you're not
into using like my tall try something
like this there's also a lot of ass and
remedies for getting rid cramp so one
good tumeric like a tumeric latte or
something like that is really good I
also like using cinnamon like cinnamon
MIT which is the next thing that I'm
going to show you so I love to use hot
beverages like I cannot do cold water
for some reason on my period it just
makes me like it makes me pretend
bloating more okay yes stop it and so I
like to drink hot beverages because it
calms my stomach and I feel like when
it's in my stomach it's also still warm
and so it like warms my body so this is
from the little market and I actually
got it from a project at a school my
school said Oh Peter no gave this to me
to do it osage blog post for a school
assignment and I have to keep it soon
throw someone else in sing a bath if
it's already been open I just really
like it it's fair trade and I'm just
really into this brand right now next my
mom sent me this and this is maca
supplement and maca is known for it's
something that when there
able to take when they're like getting
near their Curia because there's a
thousand there for Mon and I don't
everyone recommends it and yeah I just
keep it one of these with water and if I
feel like I need to take more I'll take
them every day and I usually just keep
them as early one right before my period
and so I mom tells me down like a crazy
hormonal psycho in a long period and I
don't disagree so I was like I'll take
them just for you mom speaking of being
crazy hormonal and psycho I get the
worst period cravings you guys I believe
I tell all of my best friends when
you're on your period calories do not
count like this is survival mode now I'm
not trying to look good anymore I'm
trying to stay sane and the only way I
can do that is through chocolate and
then like sweets and sugar I swear I
know it's all psychological I know but
it makes me feel so much better I don't
know you guys so what I unfortunately
ate too much of this week was Clif bars
because my mom sent me home with these
office of them and so this chocolate
brownie one is a lifesaver so good is
never tried it and talked about it all
the time but if we can take an actual
brownie but it's like not super bad for
you it is still process but it's okay
it's really filling so I find it
justifiable because it keeps me full or
long-term knowledge eating and snacking
and wanting a meal afterwards and then
this is the open a lot of raisin one
which it just also they're one of my
classic favorites keep it a literal
cookie so good and lastly one thing I
didn't get to have this week but it's my
favorite it's the Trader Joe's brownies
crisp and I'll keep a picture of them
right here but they are vegan and they
are amazing and if you buy them warning
you will probably eat a whole bag but
it's okay
calories don't count in your community
guys I I promise and today I just
apologize it's a nice last we will not
on my period
I need a heating pad this is my favorite
heating pad in the world my mom's and
just made them I think
Amazon and it has a bunch of different
stuffing
I will always put it on high and I will
lay with it on my stomach and watch
Netflix for hours when I wake up in the
morning on the first day of my period I
was going to be I don't know like if you
taste me I'm like I know I'm bleeding
right now and so I just have to say and
that I wake up I'm so cranky so I pretty
much do all this I put the essential
oils on I speak my mind all antique
maracas
you know I need if I need camp on open a
tampon and I'll probably eat this for
breakfast and I'll just literally lay
for the rest of the day like I was
learning to do today and watching up
like with my heating pads with my
essential oil diffuser and I'll just try
the best not surprised comment down
below what your favorite shows on this
looks right now are to wash because I
need some new shows and movies even Hulu
because I have that excuse to comment
anything that you think I should watch
cuz I'm absolutely all out of everything
also comment down below if you have any
other tips or anything that you want to
share with me or anyone else in the
comments that you do on your period
because I'm still gonna be all my
favorites another like two or three days

statisti I gave you and it without
further ado I'm going to end this video

learned something I hope that you do a
little bit of research into your tampons

this video and yeah I'll link down below
