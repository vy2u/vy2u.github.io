be really cool today to do a little vlog
of my fitness routine that I'm doing
right now because it's a little
different than what I've been doing in
any of my past videos so we might learn
something today or want to try this
workout and I recommend it because I
really like it it's like 3 o'clock in
the afternoon which is just such a
random time of day to go workout but I
wanted to vlog today's workout because I
feel like no one's gonna be at the gym
and I'll be able to film it and if
someone's out the gym I'll still try and
film it but a walk Crudup my pre workout
routine includes getting dressed no
I'm wearing this sports bra which I've
had for like 10 years from Target
because like my boobs never grew when I
grew then I'm wearing these gym shark
two-toned seamless leggings what am i
doing right now with my like I don't
know sometimes I take a pre-workout but
because a lot of my workouts right now
have been at nighttime this is really
like the first time I worked out in the
day in a while to Sunday so it was like
I'm like just chillin all day my
workouts at nighttime I don't take
pre-workout because I don't want that
energy before going to bed so I just
kind of drink water BCAAs are really
good to drink during your workout so
I'll recommend women's best has good
vegan BCA's and pre-workout flavors that
I really like I think I'm just gonna
have water today though I'm not in the
mood for any of that dough
hey guys so when I got to the gym
somehow there was actually people there
which was really random so I'm just
gonna give you a voiceover for this
first part of my workout so I've been
really into running lately so basically
I put my feet on both sides of the
treadmill and then I speed it up to
basically speed 6 and this is a really
good warm-up speed I think to start on
it's not really running but it's a good
job and then I keep my feet on either
side of the treadmill as it starts to
speed up to what I said it at I'll link
this playlist down below but I highly
recommend listening to our ease when you
workout these songs are really short but
really like good I also keep my gym
playlists and then my regular everyday
playlists completely separate that way I
don't get sick of the songs that I'm
listening to at this at the gym so
basically I run on the treadmill for 10
minutes about halfway through I increase
the speed and I start running out a lot
faster speed but for the first five
minutes I get my body it warmed up the
reason I only do 10 minutes is because I
try and basically improve on my speed
each time I run it though I don't really
think that I can run for long distances
I get so bored after 10 minutes I just
get really really bored and like I've
always said it's about enjoying the
workouts I don't want to dread having to
go and run more than 10 minutes every
day so just running 10 minutes it just
feels really really good
so then after I finished running my
favorite thing to do is to lower the
speed to around 3 or whatever
comfortable walking basis for you and
then I increase the incline all the way
this is usually my classic workout that
I would do this for a full 20 minutes
but instead I'm just gonna do this for
another 10 minutes until the entire 20
minutes of cardio is done that this is a
good warm down while also still really
engaging your muscles and then you can
see it's a really really well effective
workout and then I move on to stretching
and getting into the rest of my workout
okay think of a loaded here but
obviously I'm talking myself and so
often that's awesome and for the
opportunity time so I have a I'm gonna
go on Amazon so they said them in a pack
that starts from like lightweight and
then it goes like medium medium heavy
and the heaviest and that's one that I'm
on
so definitely work your way up don't
start with this one you're not gonna get
the message out if you're not used to it
but you want to continue to me like like
progressive overload so I'm gonna start
off I'll show you the warm-up that are
you
so this stuff I really like doing right
now I use a 15 pound weight
honestly I probably should be using
heavier weight I can probably be sick
I'm gonna start using 20-pound weights I
used to do this with like 35 pound
weight and my form wasn't great so I
decided to cut back significantly on the
way to focus more effect my form and has
been so much better
so these are my two favorite machines
that I use when it's good for your
hamstrings and this one is good for your
quads so I like to always increase
progressively by two and a half pounds
every week so this is a five-pound
weight this is a two pound weight that I
will put over here so tomorrow I'm
actually gonna be switching through to
five pound weights on top of this but I
always keep on the same thing
but next up is this so right now I have
been doing it just one leg at a time you
can definitely do it with both legs at
the same time I really feel like I have
an inconsistency and your strength in
both of my leg my hamstrings not so much
but my quads definitely so I do them at
one by one
so now other ones still work out so much
the end of the workout is done where we
started on the ground with resistance
bands so it's good to and with something
that's like a little bit easier to like
later reps because typically you're
exhausted by the end of your workout so
while you will do cardio after Network
outs like and you could have birds to
get out of the way because it leads me
up a lot all about what your preference
is
so what now that those steps are done so
the last thing that you're gonna do is
you're gonna just do simple like reasons
I think I like doing up from the ground
if you can do them on like what your
back on this like your shoulders I'm not
but that always kind of hurts my lower
back and let me know if you think that I
mean if you know why I think maybe I can
like fix my form so it won't so I'm
gonna do that and I'm gonna stretch then
we're done
for me it's really important that like
my workouts are like time sensitive
because I don't want to be in the gym
for two hours doing things for doing all
these things I feel like it really just
like hits every spot that I wanted to do
for my workout and if the consistency is
what it's all about it doesn't matter if
you're here for two hours or if you here
for thirty minutes as long as you do
something you feel good about and you're
consistent with it and you continue to
challenge yourself then I feel like you
had a good workout so and also angry
doggies about here making sure that I
don't rest too long in between thoughts
because some people used up and then the
rest for like five minutes so I guess
I'm kind of it thank you guys for
watching my workout routine let me know
is any problems below would be kind
because I'm not an expert and I'm not
like trying to say this what you need to
do this is just what I like doing and
I'm not perfect at it but I enjoy it so
yeah give it a thumbs up if you liked it
