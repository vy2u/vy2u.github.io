know how to ask okay hands off me okay
beans I can't see okay here you guys
what is up I hope it's okay that I hold
the camera like this really quickly
before I start the video today I'm going
to be showing you guys my room tour and
I live in apartment in downtown Los
Angeles in a two-bedroom one-bathroom
with my roommate and you can watch a
roommate tag somewhere around here and
I'm just going to show you my room today
but if you like this video let me know
in comments below and I can do a full
room tour I mean a full apartment or if
you really want one yeah so let's just
get into the video everything in my room
is basically from Ikea Target Bed Bath
and Beyond
pretty basic stuff I am also in college
so I moved out so this is like my first
apartment so this is like literally all
my doing my room everything yeah it's
mine I paid for all of it basically so
please no hate in the comments below
either because that's like very common
in rooms for videos because people think
we're bragging I'm not bragging you guys
just really regrets requested at this
video and I want some of you it seemed
like a fun idea too so let's get into
the video okay so I'm going to be using
my hand this whole video and hindsight
bias I should have gotten a manicure but
we're just going to work with it please
excuse my disgusting hands so right when
you walk into my room the doors right
there
you see this and this is like my
bookshelf nightstand area and then
that's like my filing cabinet with like
all my schoolwork and stuff in it so
sure you up close like what I have going
on so right here I keep all of my
glasses and sunglasses there's like a
few missing because they're like in my
purses right now but I keep it all right
there just what I can grab on the way
out I also have my children hiding on
the corner and my favorite perfume that
I spray every day which is an
Abercrombie &amp;amp; Fitch perfume is it in
focus
it's called perfume number one undone
and they sell it right now if you guys
want to get it it's like my favorite
Abercrombie if it makes the best perfume
then I keep a whiteboard with all my
video ideas I want to show you guys I
don't want you guys to see and then like
I said these just all have literally
school stuff and I'm like random in
it like I can't even explain any of this
so
is something that I really like right
here--like I like what I did with this
on top I have my passion planner and
your caution planner is like something
you can like write in every day for like
your plans that you have for the week
and it's really useful I recommend if
you guys like I've never heard of it go
check out their website because I really
like their products then behind you I
have these two candles both which I got
from the Melrose trading post in the one
in the middle is from Anthropologie they
also really good this is white teeth
which is my favorite selling candle ever
please my arm is getting so tired
oh my god so above all that you might be
wondering like what is this and this is
my dream board basically that I made
before this one anothers quarter started
up it on and basically it just has like
everything on it that like I want to use
to inspire myself every day like the
house that I picked out in Calabasas
when I want to get older and like have a
family the dog that I want some quotes
that I find inspiring has YouTube I
won't get many subscribers before I die
travel that's really attractive man
laying in bed yeah basically just like
everything that motivates me over here I
have this lamp from Ikea and then this
is my favorite smelling candle also from
Urban Outfitters this candle has lasted
me the longest time it's literally
amazing
oh it just briefly to go over with
Indies basically in this first one I
just have my purse my journal in this
one I keep all my cords and stuff like
my camera stuff and I have like um my
phone charger in here so when I'm laying
in bed at night like I have that and my
laptop to charger in them down here I
keep all my stuff for situm and then I
keep all of my other books that I've got
enough venom in here
pretty simple and while we're down here
let's talk about this rug that I'm
standing on so this rug is from Ikea and
it's just like a faux fur rug everyone
has them they're really great I got the
cheap ones so this one's like I know
like ten dollars I think but it's really
cute it just add some flare to the room
also right when you walk into my room
you see this I want to believe poster
someone to me this is referencing a
movie I had no idea that it was when I
bought it I just bought it because I
simply liked it so yeah I mean I got at
the dollar shooting post
no I thought I just thought that it was
cool not about it okay so up next this
is my bed my favorite part of my room I
get a lot of questions about this
particular tapestry right here and it's
from Urban Outfitters I think it was
like $40 and I'm pretty sure they still
sell it online I really like it
side note here while we're over here I
wish that my walls were white but my
building won't let me paint them so
they're like an off-white which it
really bothers me but can't do anything
about it my status and bed frame are
like my mattress itself it's all from
Ikea I don't like my mattress that that
much but I mean I didn't know what I was
doing when I bought it you've heard me
talk about it before buying a mattress
is actually the most difficult part of
moving somewhere for the first time so
one of these days maybe we're going to
do mattress I would love that and then
all of my pillows are standard pillows
that one fluffy one right there is from
Target I'll get up close you can see it
better so it's really like cute and
fluffy and it's like light blue and dark
gray which I really love because I don't
really have any color in my room so it
just adds like a cool vibe to my room
and then of course I put my laptop here
for aesthetic purposes and I static
purposes only I also have these Firefly
like fairy lights going all around my
room well I'm sorry they only go about
my window but whatever so over here this
is like not my favorite part of my room
this is something that I bought while
ago and student housing and it's just a
glass desk from Ikea and the chair and
on top of it I just have random stuff I
don't have anywhere else to put a fan a
lamp from Target coins and then just
random little thing from Target and then
like whatever that is it's not my
favorite thing ever I do want to make a
cuter maybe get a white rug to put it
underneath it because all these cords
are really unattractive yeah I just have
it in my room for now this is to be
moved up further notice I really don't
know what to do with this in my room in
my room I also have these shades I'm
going to keep this closed just because
the street is kind of annoying right
there but I'll show you guys this area
right now the far left of my desk I just
keep my favorite perfumes really nothing
spectacular this is on my favorites from
urban out
feels like coconut and then some
pictures that people gave to me a
shout-out to them then right here I have
all of my jewelry that I keep just kind
of hung up it's really unorganized right
now I need a better system of organizing
this but it's literally all my chokers
and then all of my debris down here I
guess yeah that's like my bracelet
this is a really cute thing that I got
from Target and I just keep all my rings
in it I'm gonna probably put my chokers
on here soon I haven't figured it out
yet I'm looking for more storage this is
the most amazing thing that ever
happened to me this is not product
placement this is literally just me
talking about how much I literally love
this speaker it's both and it's really
small you can see a size reference like
my hand I love it I've had it for a year
it lasts so well I played really good
music this is kind of embarrassing to
show you but these are all my said
succulents I'm literally the most
irresponsible worst person ever I can't
keep anything alive for the life of me
like how do you kill a succulent tell me
it's like not possible but I do they're
like oh the poor baby
in my defense when I bought these I
didn't realize that they didn't have
like holes on the bottom where they have
holes on the bottom so watering them
gets water everywhere and I have a head
of chance oh I get it better I could put
them on that I don't know that's not
relevant right now but I have three
succulents that I got and this is a Salt
Rock lamp these are very very popular
right now they're known for like
releasing positive ions into the air
that's what my mom told me so I thought
it was really key actually send it to me
for a surprise for the start of this
quarter so thanks mom I really like it
at nighttime it makes the room look
really cool this is probably my favorite
part of my room I wish it looked better
on camera but this is like my glam
section of my room I got these two
tables from Ikea like everything else in
my room and these two bins down here
from the Container Store and I made it
like my glam section so it's like hair
on the side makeup on this side nails in
the middle so I'll get up close to enjoy
you so we have like all my straightening
irons
curling irons hairdryer brush and then
all of my favorite products on the back
and then this is like my makeup remember
that I use it's like up close and I'm
like it's got a ring light and then my
essential stuff brushes like keep I
brushes in one and face brushes in the
other and then regular random stuff and
then down here
the lighting kind of sucks but I keep
all of my eye and lip makeup in there
and then I keep all of my face makeup in
here i shadow on top and then just all
my other like stuff that i use every day
that on keep close to me and then i just
have like always been in this random
thing that i don't have use for right
now Bob my makeup stuff I have this
picture of Oprah she kind of just washes
over me and like looks down on me she
supports me she's there for me whenever
I need her she's from like a guardian
angel but the story behind him is that
Andrew Lau has a picture of Oprah on his
walls and in one of his videos he said
that it really motivated him and if it
up and it's kind of true like I feel
like there's like you know a little bit
more like motivation and pressure to get
stuff done when like Oprah's watching
over you so she's a great lady if you
you know want to give the same thing
start the trend and everyone put over on
their walls I think it's a great idea
okay so that is me and that's I bring
light I've been using to light this
video but another part of my whenever
you like is that I have three big
mirrors and behind them is actually my
closet so I'll show you how I organize
that so when you open it up I basically
keep all of my pants in this middle like
hanging thing and then all of my clothes
just hung up like normally like down
there it's really big and then I keep
all of my shoes on the ground and my
laundry basket over there so that's like
my makeup stop right there and when you
open this one you have all of my shorts
and then all of like my sauce and my
bras and stuff and then you have my
tripod
yoga mat I have never used that I spent
like 20 dollars on and I just like
random stuff up there and it's pretty
basic let me show you this other part to
it
recently I also got these really big
storage things from Ikea that I really
like because they're really good for
like I'm gonna be throwing all your
random like extra sheets and stuff in so
it doesn't look messy up here it looks a
lot more organized so I like it so that
is all for this video and I will see you
guys next Friday or sometime soon with a
rmally I'm excited just take my mom</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
