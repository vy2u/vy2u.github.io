only a p.m. nice job I'm gonna go put on
a face mask and watch the Netflix and go
to bed oh all right time to get work
started what 3 a.m. better try again
tomorrow alright hey YouTube what is up
and welcome back to my channel if you're
new here my name is Liv I make new
videos every Monday and Friday it's a
good time feel free to subscribe and
join our family today we are going to be
sharing up by a homework routine so this
is gonna cover all of my study tips my
procrastination tips and just how I get
the damn thing done so the first thing
you need to do before even starting your
homework is you need to set aside time
to do your homework so I have a passion
planner and in my pocket planner
I just basically block off a reasonable
amount of time that I think it's gonna
take to do my homework so for example on
Tuesdays I blocked off the entire day to
do my statistics um work because yes it
takes me the entire day every week the
entire day outside but seriously always
overcompensate rather than under
compensate that way you know you have
enough time so I like to always just
write it down from a certain time say
11:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. I'm going to be
doing this amount of homework it's also
best to always schedule it earlier in
the morning because when you just get it
done earlier it's off your plate but
when you wait all day to do it no
chances for getting done go down more
and more I swear every hour get it done
then and then just be done with everyone
so that I rather than wait till
nighttime to do it and then I'll do it
so next before I start my homework again
I have to snow set things up first so I
have to organize the space I don't know
my home again so I have to make sure
everything around me is cleaned and neat
because I would
way too distracted by it and it will
honestly stress me out more if I have to
clean my space while I'm working I'll be
like way too all over the place so just
having a clean relaxing environment
maybe light a candle I like my essential
oil diffuser and just chill I also
prefer to homework in bed so sometimes
just making the bed and just getting it
like neat that way when I'm laying in it
it doesn't feel like it's time to go to
sleep it feels like it's time to do my
work kind of my next tip is definitely
definitely a game changer if you don't
already do this data time on your phone
for when you're doing your homework so
that way you have study breaks this way
you kind of are completely dedicated to
doing your about your homework for a
certain amount of time and then give
yourself at a 30 minute study break
twenty to thirty minutes what I do is I
do an hour and a half of studying and
then about twenty to thirty minutes of
just breaking and just putting my works
inside and like being on my phone and
catching up on things and eating I
always have food on my study breaks also
when you're doing your homework make
sure that during that hour or hour and a
half that you are doing your work you
put your phone not just on the Sabbath
but put it face it down so that way no
notifications distract you because you
know how it is you get one notification
and you're like oh it's fine I'll just
check this one snapchat and then I'll
get off my phone and the next thing you
know it's been 45 minutes and you've
been on your phone doing nothing for the
entire amount of time and you don't even
remember how you got there so put your
phone down break a little the upside out
put your phone upside down next I have
been recently really liking listening to
music when I do homework I used to never
be able to do this I would be so AVD
that I could not have even just like a
fan blowing in the background while I do
my homework I would have to just
completely focus on my homework but now
having like TV or YouTube video or just
like some music playing in the
background it really helps me study
better because I think it entertains me
a little bit it's kind of sad though but
I really do need it to be in the game my
favorite playlists to listen to is my
it's wavy bro play this on Spotify I can
link it up below for you guys the next
homework tip and the most important work
tip is you need to stay feel about who
your homework I eat really big high carb
lunches and high protein lunches on days
and room
that way I mentally stay fueled but also
while I'm doing homework I like to have
things to snack on not like potato chips
and things like that because that would
get dangerous but I like kind of like
carrots or green beans or cucumbers
things that are like literally zero
calories but just give you something to
do with your arms and hands which sounds
so pointless but you know it just helps
you feel better when you're like reading
something for an hour to just be able to
like move your arm and like you have
some sort of entertainment even if it's
through food okay so now we're kind of
getting it's like while you're actually
doing homework so while I'm doing my
homework I like to have a usually I use
Google so Google document open and just
a blank document and that way I take
notes on things that I find important
while I'm doing my readings or my
assignments I just write things down
that I find important that I actually
could actually want to learn things
sometimes sometimes like not always but
sometimes I like to learn things so
write down things that I find important
or interesting and also best tip ever is
if you're doing an assignment and it
requires a greedy and answering
questions always read the questions
first like if this is a test or quiz or
just a homework assignment any situation
an essay any situation read the
questions first and then go back and do
the assignment like do the readings next
since I am low-key not that great at
grammar I don't I I don't know why my
business professor pointed out this free
website to me cut grammarly comm and
this has changed the game this is not
sponsored it's like sounds like it is
but no but right now I'm just using the
free version where you basically just
copy and paste your like essay into
their website and it shows you all the
grammar mistakes and you guys just need
to check it out I will link it below
it's so helpful so I was in the middle
of filming all the little other like
science clips for this video and I
remembered that I forgot to include one
really important tip that I have
literally lived by for years Quizlet is
like the best site ever for answering
your homework questions you can't find
us specially for av classes for those of
you who take those in high school or
even in college because god bless all
these people without our nice enough to
make public Quizlet like pages where
they basically just put all the answers
and questions so they're like AP classes
in flashcard form and it's just it saved
my life so many times I had to share
with you guys but yeah
literally it seems my life so continue
on live my next advice is to have the
numbers of a few people in your classes
that way you can contact them with any
questions this is obviously pretty well
known like always get the number of a
couple people in your class that way you
can text them if you have problems or
questions or you want to just like or
you want to just bond with them over how
shitty the classes and how much you may
be doing the work I always talk to
people when I'm lost in this I'm and I'm
like have you done this yet hey like how
does yours look like hey can we compare
of assignments to make sure that we're
going to get similar grades they're just
the best feeling as a student is when
you ask your classmate if they've done
their work yet and they say no and you
had neither and it's just like wow we're
really in this together man we really
are gonna fail this class together so
the truth to getting through
procrastination is you have to believe
that like it can actually get done where
there's a will there's a way so find
your will
I know it's hard you guys but it's good
to you the stamina time to do it right
now just sit down for two or three hours
and get it done then it's gonna take you
the exact amount of time to do it later
right before the deadline it's into you
the same amount of time two three hours
to get it done but you're gonna be super
stressed so just get it done like it
sucks I know it does but take all those
tips that I gave you before this and
you'll be a lot better off and you'll be
set up a lot more organized you have to
believe that it's possible in order to
make it happen I actually learn that I'm
ever in this class it was like your will
to be motivated by something is driven
by how much you believe it's possible to
happen so you have to believe that it's
possible to happen and it eventually
everything gets done everything gets
turned in and somehow it all happens and
we survive you know sometimes there's
those flaws here and there we're not
perfect human beings shout out to my
statistics teacher starts that meltdown
I had last week you email me back
they'll be great dude
oh yeah the assignments not gonna
disappear if you don't do it you just
have to get it done and you'll feel so
much better after you're done so try and
like think of something you can reward
yourself with sometimes I say okay if
you get all your homework done just go
get your nails done or go get something
to eat for dinner that you really want
or sit down and binge watch a new
Netflix series like you can treat
yourself just get this done and it will
be over with you'll feel so much better
for example if this doesn't motivate you
then nothing will last night it was
Friday night
I have my online homework due on Friday
nights and it takes me like five hours
to do just one class of online homework
I was so close to giving up I was like
we can just take the Elvis week just
like take the F literally just take it
but I was like no like just just get
through it you can make it happen even
if it takes you an extra hour because
you're just going slower just make it
happen even if it's not your best work
ever just get it done and I did and I
feel good about that because it's out of
the way and now I get you know probably
it'll be on the assignment instead of
gonna get up for not doing it I don't
know you guys homework is homework
quizzes and has everything like
schoolwork look you know what just who
cares you know there's good things in
life besides homework and we don't need
to focus our entire lives around it stop
being so stressed out about it just
enjoy your life you need an acai bowl
