we've been all of the place lately Soros
you know often week Nubia often I
thought it'd be a perfect way to
celebrate the end of my classes finally
and this sort of summer with a summer
bucket list video leave a comment down
below of what your summer bucket list
it's maybe just like your top idea give
this video a thumbs up if you liked the
ideas that I have the top thing of my
summer bucket list is to finally get my
first real tattoo I have one behind my
neck of a white heart which is just an
outline and not many people can see it
ever so I really want to get a seashell
I think I've been debating this for a
while than what I want it to be but I
wanted it to be something that
represented Cape Cod but I didn't want
to get a wave because that's what
everyone has and I don't want to get the
sailboat because I think it's just not
cute enough but growing up my family and
I used to walk the beach nearby our
house all the time and we would collect
sea glass but I can't get a piece of
steel out tattooed on me so seashell is
the closest conclusion that I couldn't
do and I think a really dainty outline
on my wrist would be really really
really cute or like behind my ear I
don't know something like that I really
want to get that that's the one that I
want to get this summer me more but that
one is the top one that I get it next I
really want to try out more fitness
classes I don't often go to classes I
usually do my own workout it's for a lot
of reasons but this summer I really want
to try out boxing Pilates yoga my
friends talk about Orangetheory yeah I
don't want to try new stuff I really
like having consistent workouts and the
problem with things like SoulCycle is
that it's so expensive that I can't live
a consistent life with it so that's why
I don't usually do those things I just
like
to membership but I think I want to try
some stuff oh you know we like it the
next thing that I want to do is start a
vlog Channel
obviously I have this channel but I
think that I want a vlog channel where I
can post like super informal vlogs where
it's just like really all over the place
content just like a funner side of me
and keep everything was like clean and
aesthetically pleasing over here I don't
know kind of like one channel for each
of my Gemini personalities maybe I
shouldn't keep all my blocks in this
channel I should do weekly blogs let me
know what you want comment below what
you think about that my next bucket list
thing is to finish decorating my
apartment because we've just lived in
and I really want to finish decorating
my bedroom we have all the necessary for
an ensuring that we need right now but
there's a lot of bare walls and empty
spaces I also really want to spend
actual time outside this summer I say
and when I do it every summer and I just
stay inside all day but the beaches in
LA aren't cute they're not cute at all
and if you want you can go to Malibu but
it's like an hour drive or you need a
newborn on the beach go take an hour
drive so my realistic goal here is to
like go outside of my rooftop or on my
balcony and like tan and the day or like
just be outside in nature and hike I
want to hike so much I just want to be
outside of it all summer long because
I've never had a summer in our life that
wasn't in down
where it's disgusting outside and it
just smells like dog piss everywhere you
go and that's like not a lot it's
because there's so many dogs in downtown
in little apartments and this city has
eight patches of grass like every block
and so the dogs all go to the bathroom
outside on that Patrick laughs brah so
the entire city just smells like dog pee
sorry I'm talking quietly right now by
the way I'm not trying to be like a it
some more but like the apartment and so
it's like really
echoey and I just want my neighbors in
the hallway to like hear me yeah so
what's the summer bucket list without
some travel plans so this summer and for
sure when it you thought I know that
because the Brady booked my flights in
the 26 and I'm gonna be there for two
weeks so excited and well on Cape Cod I
have to do it all that would mean if you
know from last year it's my favorite
place on earth I go every year like
since I was born I've been like every
single year we go to the same spot and
it's like my favorite reason right
and we basically just found like one or
two nights there and we do all the
things that we need to in that time and
it's perfect obviously I want to go to
Boston long home and when I'm in Boston
I have to eat
bye Chloe because that's my favorite
thing to buy Chloe and Seaport Boston is
like everything to me I don't know why
like no other bye Chloe compares if you
ask me I also really want to go to San
Francisco because that's where my alley
is from and I love San Francisco so much
so I have to go home with her once just
to see it again I try and go there as
often as I can because it's so beautiful
up there I'm so jealous of you if you're
from Northern California because I think
it's so much better better
Southern California another thing I
really need to get done this summer and
I need to fix my hair
my roots are growing out and it's just
kind of toning it a little bit too
yellow so I'm trying to get more of like
a beach blonde hair I don't know we're
gonna be blonde until probably just
summer this year and then we're just
going back to brown because I can't
maintain Escala it's damaging my hair so
much I should just go back to like a
nice light brown we'll see what happens
I also really want to learn more
creative vegan recipes this summer I
feel like I make the same stuff all the
time and I feel like I have a bigger
picture now and more room for
ingredients because before I was sharing
these some Wallace kitchen on the earth
we didn't even have a pantry we made our
own and utility closet so I couldn't
really buy a lot of ingredients at once
because there was no place to store any
of it so I really want to get more
creative at making videos and food like
for myself I also want to start a
healthier more new routine but now that
I'm living in an apartment I need to
like literally start from your routine
like I can't keep doing the one that I
have my old apartment so I'm struggling
with that right now
can they never have a morning that's
assume is the oven because I'm in finals
I'm an intern and get you to great I
also I feel like I've been bullied into
buying the hydro flask what if I won I
want to get the all-white one and I'm
gonna put like Lilly cute stickers on it
because you know like the stickers that
glossier gives you and then there's two
Etsy shops that sell stickers but I'm
obsessed with and I can try and link
them below when I find it but when I buy
the stickers I'll tag them on my
Instagram stories you can see them I
also really want to go to Disneyland
this summer because I've never never
been I've been to the wind Florida when
I was like 2 years old my obviously you
don't remember it at all and I'm just
I'm just feeling so out of the loop like
I've always wanting to know that why do
people obsess about Disneyland so much
so I have to go just to understand it
and I also really need to go to
Universal Studios and go to the Harry
Potter world exhibit because that would
be a treatment and lastly as appreciate
sounds I really want to have another
summer like last summer where I was just
thriving it's the first summer that I
started using the word throw I think
that somewhere it literally summed up
how I felt I felt so at peace with my
body in my life and I just want that
against myself I had a rough winter and
it's taking me a long time to come to
terms with just understand what went on
this winter in my brain and with my body
and all the different changes that
occurred good and bad so now that I've
kind of reached a better headspace and
before I'm not there I just want to kind
of get back to that good space that I
was in because when I feel good and make
content that feels good and I know that
you guys feel good about that too and
that's all that matters to me is
inspiring you guys to love and embrace
yourselves and to thrive like not word
it's just it's just everything to me
because it truly symbolizes the best I
had ever felt in my life and
I just want to always be driving and
every sense of the word I'm really
excited about life right now while I'm
filming this I said when I woke up I was
still in school and then I have a lot
going on already in the first few weeks
of summer I don't think that I have a
clear schedule yet and so I get back
from Cape Cod July 11 so these next this
next month it's gonna go by really fast
for me anyways I hope you guys like this
video I just thought it would be like
cute and calm and maybe you guys
thinking about what you want to do this
summer but come below anything that you
want to do this summer and achieve love
you guys so much I hope you're having an
amazing day wherever you are and you
deserve it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
