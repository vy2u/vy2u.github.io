channel if you're new here my name is
lip and today I'm going to give you a
tour of my bedroom I have just recently
redecorated my room and picked up a few
new things and I'm really excited to
show you guys how I haven't like
rearranged right now I'm really happy
with how it looks it's kind of like a
really clean aesthetic I stick to buying
things that are silver I don't buy any
coal to my room and I buy basically
black and white and gray so that's kind
of like my neutral theme that I have
going on and I love it I think it looks
really clean and organized right now and
it's just so homey so I hope you guys
like this video also if you're not
already feel free to subscribe and join
the family I make new videos every
Monday and Friday and it is a good lit
time without further adieu I'm just
sending a try design room and show you
it pretty basic explanation of what a
room tour is alright welcome to another
you guys who are already here but this
is now my front door so this is where
you would come into my room there's
nothing over here but I'm thinking my
bedroom so I'm gonna turn your ass and
show you everything alright so I'm gonna
start this off by sitting on top of my
dresser while I show you this behind me
so these are wall decals and they're
from walls need love calm you can also
get them off of Urban Outfitters they're
just giant cactuses with succulent
flowers on them which I love the
aesthetic of I just think they're really
fun and they don't damage your walls at
all so they kind of like we're perfect
for an apartment situation or like any
college dorm room where you can't really
do much to your walls so this is a six
door IKEA dresser from the series called
mall not open on the screen but
basically I had a different series of
furniture and I bought everything from
the mall in the series and this dresser
has six drawers and in it I keep a lot
of my clothing and
show you one by one within each door
just so you can get a sense of like what
my organizational pattern is so over
here I have it's not like super
organized and it was all folded at one
point but you know how life goes all the
folded stuff is like still underneath
but that's my exercise drawer this is my
sleep shirt drawer and these are my
pajama bottom drawer and then over here
I have clothing that I want to sell on
Poshmark
or get rid of here I have sweatshirts
this drawer doesn't even open because
there's just so many and then this is
where I keep a bunch of like
miscellaneous things that I like don't
have a room for I have a Bose speaker
that I've owned forever and I'm obsessed
with and I carry it all over my
apartment with me this is one of my
favorite candles ever and I've read it
so much that the glass actually turned
black so I need to definitely pick up
another one and then this is an old vase
from a succulent that I had from Trader
Joe's and I emptied it out and I put all
of my sunglasses in here alright alright
so this is my bedside table right here
so I basically just have a bookshelf
from Ikea and on the bookshelf I have a
rock salt lamp that my mom said to me
shout it's my mom she got it from Amazon
but you can honestly get them anywhere
these days and then I first have my
journal which you guys saw my night
routine I write in every single night
and then I have all these different
compartments so this first one is where
I keep like my purse my wallet all my
kind of like things that I bring with me
on the go this drawer right here is the
one next to where I sleep so I keep like
an extension cord with all of my
electronics plugged into it so like my
phone charger my laptop charger down
here in the bottom one I keep all of my
schoolbooks it's cool strengths next
week so we're really excited about that
and the next of that is where I keep my
backpack and then just like this thing
where I put every single thing that
anyone has ever given me an email
birthday cards anything that can fit
into here I put in gear and I keep it
because I'm a porter and I'm sentimental
and I don't throw things out so yes
that's pretty much this area so this is
obviously my bed so my comforter my
sheets are often this online website
called Wayfarer my big gray pillows that
I love and I'm obsessed with are from
Target and I got those and I didn't
expect them to change my life the way
that they did but they 100% improve the
quality of my life so much and then in
my bed tray is from Ikea it was only ten
dollars I was gonna order one from
Amazon in the wind on Amazon were like
thirty dollars so when I found this one
IKEA I was like it's kind of like gross
and plasticky but I'll give it a try
because if I don't end up using it or
liking it that I only waste if I'm not
on it
so now just quickly show you my bedside
table on this side of my bed I have my
favorite fall candle and then I got this
lamp which is kind of cool because it's
just a glass dome thing I don't know but
I accidentally got it in gold when I
meant to buy it in like a silver finish
and so I'm kind of sad about that I'll
probably end up going back and getting
the silver one and putting this gold one
in my living room just that like
everything in my room is congruent is
that the word I don't know I've been
talking about this lamp for too long
okay moving the freak on on the ground
over here I have a rug that is from Ikea
it's like they're really basic cheap ten
dollar sheepskin rug like knockoff
sheepskin of course I threw it in the
wash because I was too lazy to vacuum it
and I basically ruined it so it's out of
time
don't be an idiot like me I also have
this random basket in the corner of my
bedroom with the heating pad in it I
don't know why I own this basket but I'm
so happy that it holds this one stupid
item for me so okay sorry the landing is
like super Marshall rear so I have the
windows open right now but this is my
news desk and so excited about this this
is where I'm gonna be doing all my
makeup from now on before I had to
tangles on the ground over there and I'm
gonna sit on the ground and my makeup
and it's just her to get old to me I
wanted to be more
organize so I got this - from Ikea it is
of course the Maul book series that it's
so awkward saying that we're because I
can they LM like what what is that but
let me show you like how I have it
organized I'm so in love with this so
let me show you the closer look of it so
the chair that I have with the desk is
from ikea also and this pillow that I
just got is from Target and it kind of
let me show you it kind of matches the
grayscale on these pillows like they all
kind of go together so over here I have
an acrylic container that contains all
of my curling wands my hair brushes my
scrunchies then I have my other curling
one thing hair straightener I have my
brushes and then I have all of my makeup
in order of how I use it so this is like
tools and then we have face stuff this
is the best foundation ever I'm gonna be
doing like an update of fall get ready
with me soon and that's like my favorite
foundation ever and I'll probably be
doing I get ready with me soon give this
video a thumbs up you want to see that
but that's all it's in this drawer and I
love that it's like just hid it under
there
and then on top of my dresser I have
just a few things that couldn't fit into
any drawers and then this is genius let
me explain this to you so I had
container of micellar water that I loved
to use to take my makeup off with but it
was like a really shitty like container
so I put it all into a spray bottle and
now when I take my makeup off I just do
this so now when I take my makeup off I
just spray a cotton pad and then bam
like it's literally brilliant so you're
welcome and then I have some jewelry
hanging on top of everything this isn't
really that cute of a setup and I should
probably get something more
aesthetically pleasing soon but that's
what I have for now
then I have these plastic containers I
want to replace them with acrylic
containers but I need to find some first
and acrylic containers are really
expensive so in here I have just a bunch
of other makeup that is like kind of
miscellaneous and I don't really use
everyday and then over here I have
another one and I keep a lot of my hair
stuff in here and then this is one of my
favorite new things this is a mirror
from Ikea and it's such a big mirror
like it's amazing and I just actually
posted a new Instagram with this verse
so yeah this is my full on makeup
section to war I have a
and down there okay and now I'll just
awkwardly show you my giant closet
mirrors there's no way to show you this
without like showing myself so hey um
but yeah this is where I keep all of my
clothing and it's kind of unorganized
but I will show you kind of what it
looks like
so I had these three bins here from
Target that have boots and one sneakers
and another and sandals in another
because I didn't feel like buying shoe
storage so I just bought baskets and put
my shoes and them cuz I'm lazy so yeah
it works though and then I have jeans up
in here and then I have shorts over
there and then I have all of my clothing
organized from tank tops to t-shirts to
dresses and then I'll go over there so
that I have sweatshirts and jackets all
