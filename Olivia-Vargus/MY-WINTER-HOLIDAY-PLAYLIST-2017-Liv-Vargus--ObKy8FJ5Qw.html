to my channel if you're new here my name
is Liv I make new videos every Monday
and Friday feel free to subscribe and
join our family so today's video is
gonna be a holiday video and if you
don't believe me I have my Christmas
tree so you can't really argue me on
that
so since Thanksgiving is officially over
we are now in full-blown holiday season
so this video is going to be a holiday
playlist video I'm gonna be playing for
you my favorite Christmas music that I
listen to I also have the winter candy
apple by Bath &amp;amp; Body Works lit because
that is my favorite Christmas candle and
I have a fireplace so we are a holiday
Vives
ass also you can't forget this bad boy
oh my god no I'm all alone in my
apartment right now it's sitting with a
Santa hat off
I just thought this video would be kind
of chilled to film after the holidays I
didn't want to film anything super
serious since everyone's just pretty
much in a food coma or Black Friday
shopping or just relaxing so I hope that
this is just like a fun video to watch
but comment down below what your
favorite holiday songs are I will leave
my Spotify playlist below and let's get
started
Oh
Oh Merry Christmas
if you don't cry while I sing this song
something's seriously wrong with you
 okay we need something real upbeat
after that because that made me my feel
it's beginning to look like Christmas
that's right bitch this year I'm giving
my heart to a jar of peanut butter
because that's the only thing that's
gonna love me back
myself
I'm not gonna lie to you this next one
it um it stings a little bit it's from a
dark time of my life that I'm not really
proud of well you know what it's a part
of my past and it made me who I am today
so I am proud of it but from my belieber
stage we're gonna listen to of course
the one and only Justin Bieber mistletoe
by the way if you're watching this right
now go favorite or retweet this tweet
that I put up on Twitter about being
under the mistletoe like a week ago
because only if you relate of course if
you have a boyfriend then that's great
for you I'm happy for you I really am
see this this is happiness for you for
being in a relationship during the
holidays I'm not salty about it I'm I'm
fine look at me I'm fine
I'm trying way too hard
yeah like this video if you're willing
to be single during the holidays like me
so that I used to feel a little bit
better and less lonely because I'll know
there's more of you out there with me
I wanted to make that word just I'm
sorry yet holiday it out already I gotta
save some of this cheer because we got a
lot we got a long time to go before it's
actually Christmas we don't like one all
right I hope this video comes out good
cuz I feel like I'm gonna have to cut
out so much of this embarrassing footage
because I'm just so cringy it's hard not
to be cringy when you're listening to
holiday music try and argue me on this I
challenge you to make this videos too
because I haven't seen a lot of people
making it so if you're a youtuber make a
holiday playlist video and put it up
because I think it's so much fun to film
alright make sure that you like and
subscribe if you are not already to join
our family I make new videos every
Monday and Friday you can turn our
notifications on to to let you know when
I upload a video and now it's time
Mariah Carey play us out
can go forever</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
