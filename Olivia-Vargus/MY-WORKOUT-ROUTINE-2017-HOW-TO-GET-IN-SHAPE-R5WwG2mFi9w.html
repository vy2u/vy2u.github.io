to my channel or commuted by channel
welcome my name is live and today I'm
going to show you my fitness routine I
talked about this on my channel a lot
but if you didn't already know I
recently started going to gym about four
or five months ago and I really never
felt better in my life like it was the
best choice I ever made if you want to
learn more about like me and my personal
fitness journey give this video a thumbs
up I would love to do a video I sit down
and talk more personally about it today
I'm going to be showing you my everyday
fitness routine though so before I get
into this video and show you everything
that I do in this gym I just wanna point
out that I am still growing my muscle
groups I'm still what I consider a
beginner fitness is a long term
lifestyle and so I'm not trying to rush
anything in the gym I'm taking it
healthy day-by-day I do workout about
five or six times a week in the morning
and this is basically what I do it's
kind of a full body workout but makes a
target more of my salute sometimes I
target more of like my abs but we're
going to be have a full body workout
someone to show you just everything so
you kind of like can pick and choose
what you want to do but I think that
these workout that I'm going to show you
are like the best for beginner and like
people that want to start building
muscle and like losing fat so that is
what I'm showing you today so I really
hope that you enjoyed this video give it
a thumbs up if you do and let's get to
it
so the first step to any good workout of
course is a great playlist so this is
one that I listen to on Apple music
sometimes I actually even watch YouTube
videos while I do this workout on the
treadmill so basically I'm going to put
the treadmill on the highest incline
which is 10 and I'm going to walk at
speed 3 and I do this for about 10
minutes and usually while I do it I try
and stuff in my ABS as much as I can
and really kind of focus on the muscle
group I don't do this kind of for cardio
purposes I do this more for just sort of
like toning and strengthening my legs
because having it on a high incline is
really good for you another thing that I
do is then I turn around in just a
second and you'll see that I start
walking backwards and this is a little
uncomfortable at first I actually jumped
off the table the first time as you saw
me on snapchat it was actually kind of
funny but this is really good for your
food
as well and just your client leg muscles
do I do this for 10 minutes and then I
walk forward again for another 10
minutes and basically after about a 30
minute warm-up that I do it is a bit of
a long warm-up but this is what I like
doing you don't have to do this last 10
minutes what I do it just because
usually I'm watching a youtube video or
something and I just want to kind of
keep watching it so I do this for about
30 minutes and I usually feel it pretty
good afterwards when I'm done and of
course I always always stretch a lot
when I'm working out could you don't
want to hurt yourself
these are butterfly kicks things I don't
know but this is what I used to do when
I was younger and I love doing it and
then just stretch stretch stretch you
don't want to be sore trust me it's not
fun also make sure that you're drinking
a lot of water after you workout and eat
a lot of protein after your workout that
way you would minimize the likelihood of
you being sore the next time so now I'm
going to do these there hold fire
hydrants but I do about 15 of these and
I do it on either leg so here's the
first side so you just lift your leg up
and it looks like you're a dog peeing on
a fire hydrant which is why I think it's
calm fire hydrant but basically I do 15
of these on either side this really
feels good for your glute muscles I
think that helps to kind of like build
up the side where I have like kind of a
gap and then I do what do I don't know
what these are called you just kick your
leg and then I do 15 of these on either
side too and again you just want to
focus on sucking in your abs always as
you work out and just squeezing your
glutes of every rep that you do so after
I do that on all sides I repeat the same
workout that I just did three more times
so you do it again basically everything
I just showed you do that three more
times and then I do ask so I start off
by doing 25 crunches and this is really
funny to me because I drink was a gallon
of water I swear I saw before I worked
out so when I was doing this all I could
think about was all that water swishing
back and forth in my stomach you can see
it it's oh my god okay anyways with
focus focus on your voiceover right now
so then I do toe touches which is kind
of funny to watch with workout sorry
focus my little like fat rows between my
sports bra my leggings I look like a pug
or like a loaf of bread oh my god I'm
sorry I'm sorry
okay okay focus okay so yeah toe touches
I do 50 of these so 25 on each side
picking please but I just count to 50 in
my head and while you're doing this make
sure I say set amount of time to squeeze
your abs and then I do bicycle kicks I
send up with these are calls but this is
really good first side ABS and get
enough some matched weight and then this
is really good for lower abs I do these
25 times I like it last 150 times sorry
I'm not good at this right now so I do
this 25 times and then after that I do
Russian twist
I love these they really burn your love
handles so I do about 50 of these but
it's actually like 25 but I just count
to fifty two one two three four again it
so it's like I'm talking each time I
move back and forth so it's technically
25 anyways so after that I repeat this
entire set three times the same way that
we repeated the leg set three times so
as soon as I do a 30 second plank or
sometimes I increase if I just tie
myself my phone and then I do push-ups
and Kiana was laughing at me because I'm
so weak and like I said this is beginner
video I'm still learning how to do
push-ups when I have to keep my knees
down and I don't have much arm strength
and in my head I'm going down a lot
further than I thought I wasn't I'm
first now like seeing this video of
myself but it doesn't matter because I
used to never be able to do a push-up
and now I can ten of the like have one
so yes go me progress so then I'm going
to end it with a little bit more of a
high intense cardio workout to burn some
calories and so I'm going to be doing
the resistance SEC is five and five and
so I'm going to do this for about five
minutes
the key is to keep your rpm your rates
per minute or miles whatever it is opt I
keep it in the ones in green unless your
follicles are this game and we'll show
you that but whatever your instead is
just trying to keep it out like a study
like a number that you feel good at and
then after that I increase the and then
after that I increase the incline q10
and so you select five resolutions and
brother and I do that for another five
minutes and then after that you might
not be able to tell but I'm going to go
backwards and I do it backwards to about
five minutes and while I go backwards
yeah the baptism and while I go
backwards just really really burns my
size and justify higher lower body so I
really recommend going backwards on an
incline I'm still on incline and
resistance five and this will really
hide your sweating and after that I'm
pretty much done
aren't you guys that is my everyday
scent in 15 and how I got fit I really
hope that you enjoyed it leave me
