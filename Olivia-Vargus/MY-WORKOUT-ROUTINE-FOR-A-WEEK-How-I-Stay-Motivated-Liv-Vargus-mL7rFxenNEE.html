my channel my name is live if you're new
here I make new videos every Monday and
Friday it's a good time feel free to
subscribe and join our family so today
I'm gonna start off my weekly vlog
series of a week in my life is that like
we're calling it yeah so basically I'm
gonna film everything that I'm doing to
work out Monday through Friday this week
on Saturdays I go hiking which is like
pretty much a 30 minute cardio sesh and
then some days I take off this is the
first time I think that I'm doing this
new workout like plan usually what I had
been doing for a long time to kind of
lean out was I was doing cardio about
five times a week and I would do some
strength training but now I'm just
completely focusing on strength training
I do at home workouts the entire thing
is at home because I'm so freakin busy
right now you guys like my college
schedule is insane so before I show you
my workouts I actually just wanted to
talk about this real quick because I'm
in college and I had the summer off
which is what I had the most fitness
progress now that I'm back in school the
majority of my days are spent sedentary
doing schoolwork and needing a lot of
mental energy but not exuding enough
physical energy so I'm eating more so
I've been feeling so I've been low-key
like I'm gonna be honest you guys like
I've been feeling really down about that
because I feel like I'm not at my
highest potential that I want to be at
so I'm just trying to learn and grow and
figure out how to do this that I can
pass it on to you guys so what we're
gonna do today is show you the at home
workouts that I've been doing I went
ahead and picked up so many little
at-home things that I did a little haul
on my snapchat my insta stories I got
some weight training equipment and I'll
just show you an old review of it right
now that I'm gonna use and this way I
can apply progressive overload so
basically what that means if you don't
know is that every time you workout you
want to try and add resistance and you
want to try and add more and more
strength cause your body will get used
to what you're doing so you want to try
and continuously add more
our weights to it my goal is by January
2018 I want to get a gym membership and
actually start using like really heavy
lifting equipment and like start doing
that but right now I'm just really Maya
I made a really big mistake with my
classes this quarter and I took a lot of
online classes and it takes me 12 hours
minimum for each class to do the work
each week and it's just killing me so
we're sting so today I'm gonna show you
my leg workouts that I'm doing I focus
mainly on my butt and then tomorrow I'm
gonna do ABS Wednesday hopefully I'm
gonna do but again Thursday ABS Friday
but Saturday cardio so I start out each
workout with a five-minute cardio like
rep and then I'm gonna go into it takes
me about 45 minutes to do all the other
workouts and then another 5 minute
cardio ending and then I stretch so the
whole workout takes me about an hour I
do it all at home and I actually like
really really really like get like
sweaty and like I feel like I'm get
burning calories so we're still in the
beginning testing stages but I'll keep
you guys updated obviously intro clip is
already 4-minute so I'm like I'm sorry
and I look like crap in it so like if
you're new to my channel Hey
so let's get started first things first
I just got new headphones my workout
videos will be linked below and my
permit walls are really thin so I feel
like when I played loud music working on
the mornings my entire heart and Bellona
can hear me
so I bought these headphones and they're
wireless that I can work out with them
on and still listen to loud music like
really love music I need it to be like I
needed to drown out all of my thoughts
when I'm listening to it my best
workouts are the days where I channel my
stress and energy into them and I don't
think about anything except for like my
muscle groups and what I'm doing in that
moment I have like adrenaline from my
stress and I just channel that into
pushing myself as hard as I can so the
next thing that I want to show you
before I start working yeah
these are the woman's best collection of
pre-workout and after workout powders
and pre-workout will give you the energy
like a little bit of energy and then the
after workout has like amino acids that
like repair the muscles that you don't
get ass or crazy fruits pre-workout
booster and then this is strawberry Kiwi
for the B C A's okay so now that it's
about about fifteen minutes so what I'm
gonna do is I'm going to start off with
my five minutes of cardio
nope please don't like make fun of me or
roast me in console oh it's really like
awkward to work out on camera it makes
me kind of insecure so the way that this
works is I use my phone self timer and I
set it for one minute and then that's
the amount of time that I do one like
workout for so when I hit start I'll
start but you can switch this up each
time but I kind of mix around what I
want to do I just feel like this always
warms up the muscles that I'm about to
use and it just gets me going a little
bit before we actually get into like the
bulk of things
I definitely feel so off my game today
because last week was so hard but the
key to getting through like any doubts
or any like negative energy that you
have is having like a positive vision
that inspires you to keep working
through it all so I know that even if
like I've said this before
even if my fitness journey takes me five
years five months to get to the point
that I'm envisioning as long as I don't
stop getting there as long as I don't
stop progressing and trying that's what
matters to me the most so I will link
down below the butt workout that I'm
doing you guys can click on that and
leave it in a new tab and then when
you're done watching this video go and
like save those like a playlist on
YouTube and then you can go back and
watch those too and that's exactly what
I'm doing I'm using resistance bands
ankle weights and just heavy weights
10-pound weights when I do all of them
and I'll actually try and link down
below this stuff that I bought from
Amazon too so you guys can check that
out but now I will see you guys tomorrow
for my at workout
hey guys today is Tuesday I've come to
decide that I'm not gonna look good in
any of these clips that I'm going for
this video so so sorry but today I'm
gonna be doing an ab workout and arm
workout I have really weak upper arms so
this is like my hardest workout because
it just hurts a lot it's the biggest
like test of strength because like my
legs I already have existing muscle but
like my arms I swear I have nuttin so
I'm like starting from zero a little
update today I feel so sore that's
something I never had to deal with when
I was dressed training cardio but now
that like I'm adding weights and like
doing high reps and stuff like my legs
are so sore I also don't think I
stretched enough yesterday but it's okay
because I'm doing arms today so I don't
really need to use my legs and that's
what sore so I wanted to share this girl
on Instagram um Louise fitness if you
can like see her account you can go
follow her but she posted something
about staying motivated because she's
like oh people always ask me how I stay
motivated so I go to the gym and stuff
and her answer which is really awesome
so I'm gonna read it to you so she said
the truth is we're never gonna feel like
it we're never gonna find the external
motivation we need to push ourselves so
so stop waiting to feel like it because
you're never ever gonna feel like it
you're never gonna be able to get out of
bed in the morning go for a run unless
you just do it like literally just rip
the covers off of the bed and just get
out of it you'll always be scared you'll
in the gym unless you just go so just
saying like just do it which I know is
the Nike slogan but like because I used
to think that like Fitness people had
like some sort of special DNA in them
where they could like make it out of bed
and go running in the morning and I was
like I'm never gonna be that person but
like no you can you just have to go do
it like you just have to do it Nike
sponsor me I'm sorry if this video ends
up being long because I'm talking so
much every day but I thought that this
video will be like a good way to like
show you the structure of my workouts
and like maybe get you motivated it's
like just give you some ideas maybe I
don't know like how to workout in a week
or something so this is more about like
being motivated and being organized and
fitness and like what I do rather than
like the actual individual workouts and
like reps that I'm doing so I'll be
doing more fitness videos in the future
comment down below and you
I have a couple up like a thirty minute
busy girl workout but yeah just comment
down below any other fitness videos that
you want to see from me because this
whole week is just going to be telling
you like this kind of stuff so no it's
good started hey guys so today is
Thursday I did not blog yesterday
because I didn't workout yesterday I
ended up waking up and I was so sore and
I was like I know that it's important to
take rest but it was really hard
mentally for me to do that because like
I said at the beginning of this vlog
last week was such an off week for me I
really didn't want to have to take a
rest today so I told myself that later
that night I would work out but in the
morning let my body rest and then by the
time that I got to nighttime I was still
so sore like I literally couldn't even
like squat down and like stand back up
so I just didn't want to injure myself
anymore also I've been sore before like
I'm no stranger to that but one of the
main reasons when I get like really
really sore is usually due to having bad
form when I'm working out and so I think
that's why on Tuesday my workout was
really quick and I apologize also from
Tuesday I really didn't like vlog that
much because I was like really stressed
I had two big midterms to do that diet
and I had a presentation that night so I
got in my workout like really quickly it
took me about an hour and I feel like my
posture was just not good during it and
that's why I might have been really sore
yesterday I'm still really sore today
but I'm gonna power through because it's
good to still use your muscles sometimes
that's the best way to get over being
sore weirdly enough today we're going to
do like day and then tomorrow we add
diet hopefully next week I can make it
all 5 days of the week without having to
take one day off I have this basket over
here now that has all of my stuff in it
so I'm just gonna take what I need you
guys I kind of want to give an update on
how I feel about my pre-workout and my
after workout BCA's so my review on that
means that I really don't think that
they're doing that much I think that the
BCA's did sort of help me yesterday when
I was trying to get over being sore and
I took them even though I didn't work
out like I took the BCA's cuz like the
muscle repair thing I was
say this because I know that in my wait
last video I talked about how I used to
be really addicted to like weight loss
teens and like I was like I used to be
addicted like buying anything that like
would endorse giving you look up at her
body like even now I find myself having
these weird habits where it's like I
can't work out until I buy a new workout
leggings and I can't work out until I
get the corrective equipment and it's
really not true like yeah these things
might aid you and they might help a
little bit but at the end of the day
what really comes down to is like the
consistency that you're putting in the
effort that you're putting in you can
have pre workout boosters and have a
good workout and you can also not have
pre workout boosters and have a good
workout it really doesn't make a big
difference so I really don't like don't
lean on that and be like I can't start
working out because I don't have all the
proper equipment I can't start doing
this because I don't have the means to
go out and buy all the things that I
need but like even just like you do
membership like I'm showing you guys
like I'm doing this all in my apartment
because like I just don't have time to
go downstairs anymore and like do my
workouts that I like doing like being in
school is really taking up all my time
and like I know that sounds crazy
because it's like a two minute walk
downstairs to get to my gym but it's
genuinely just it this is what makes me
happier so it's like what's gonna make
you do the workout so I just want to say
like I don't think that like if I have
the means to get them again after I went
out of them and like I might but I
really don't think that they're like the
end-all be-all of like you have to have
to have a good workout I think that
they're just like an accessory to your
workout same with everything like seen
with these headphones same with the
weights the resistance bands like you
can still be fit without any of that you
can find a way where there's a will
there's a way so I just I don't know I
want to say that
yeah I never look crazy right now come
in the middle of a workout I completely
forgot to film so it's like 7 o clock at
night right now it's Friday night I
spent all day trying to upload my video
today which is a what a meeting today
feel free to go watch that oh we link
down below but tonight I'm doing my ab
and arm workout I'm about 45 minutes
into it but I had to stop halfway to
upload because if I find the uploader
needs like tell you guys it upload
besides it's been like 20 minutes doing
that and now I'm just gonna show you a
couple of the moves I'm doing I don't
know why I'm having a hard time finding
workouts to do today like usually I'm
pretty like go whoa go I'm good but
today I'm taking like too long in
between sets to figure out what my next
move will be which is kind of annoying
and I'm also kind of hitting a mental
roadblock today where I'm like so if I
show you Excitebike trying to do things
and I'm like it's like I can't do it
when I body can't it's like not strong
enough so I'm just like pushing through
even if I have to do like less wraps
less things or whatever like even if I
just get the workout done it's like
makes me feel better the most important
thing though is making sure that my form
is like perfect today and really like
slowing down the workout and focusing on
my breathing in my posture because I
don't want to be sore like I was on
Tuesday and Wednesday so I'm trying to
really focus on my breathing so yeah I'm
gonna do a few more a few more for like
another 30 minutes I think and then I
literally have homework to do so gotta
love that multitasking
gotta love that college life mm-hmm I
don't know why I love night workouts
like I feel like there's kind of just a
vibe to it I have my music playing on my
bows over there and then I'm just just
going for you guys see let's go
all right you guys infinity Saturdays so
on Saturdays my roommate Sean and I
always go on a hike and we go to Runyon
which is like the super basic place to
hike in LA but it's just like familiar
and it's easy to get to so if you want
to see like our hike you can follow us
on Instagram and snapchat this week felt
like a pretty decent jump back into
things after my off week last week so
I'm hoping that next week will be even
better and I can amp up everything that
I did this week and just keep adding
progressive overload and adding more
resistance and more weights and my goal
like I said it's fine to somebody to get
a gym membership the reason I don't have
one now is because I don't have time so
I'm hoping in this summer my class
schedule will be better and I'll have
time then also remember if you're
feeling unmotivated right now like your
motivation is determined by your ability
to see whether or not something is
possible so if you already don't think
that something is possible to achieve
then you're not gonna be motivated to do
it so you have to eliminate your mental
boundaries like I say mind over matter
you can do anything and so comment down
below and I am launcher because I am
launchers are so good at just giving
yourself the mental affirmation that you
are you are something and you can do
something so for me I'm gonna tell
myself today that I am strong and I'm
capable of achieving anything that I set
my mind to so comment down below and I
am mantra and the way that goes is like
I am loved I am compassionate I'm whole
I am beautiful so that we can all share
like whatever creative things we can
come up with follow me on Instagram and
on Twitter and snapchat to see the rest
of my life throughout the weeks when I'm
not vlogging and also let me know what
specifically else you want to see for me
in videos then you so much for watching
I hope you have an amazing day and I
would say later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
