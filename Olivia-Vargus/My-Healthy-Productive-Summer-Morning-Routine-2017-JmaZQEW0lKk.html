time it is if you watching this so today
I'm going to be showing you my morning
routine and as always I start on my
phone just like anyone else
and I just just a snapshot Instagram and
then I get up and I'll go into the
kitchen and right away in the morning I
have to have a cup of coffee this right
away
like I don't miss a beat I have a cup of
coffee I usually drink a blast and then
I add a couple of ice cubes just slow it
down and I can get out of a straw
because that's better view and like your
teeth you don't want to chain them this
is the coffee that I'm drinking right
now I'm not super obsessed with it but
it was really cheap at Trader Joe's but
I was like obsessed with dark roast
coffee
and this literally isn't like dark
enough for me so kind of a fail but I'll
try again next week I'll dip like the
donut shop it's what I usually buy and
then I always always always have a full
liter of water right away in one so
these two things I drink them and then
this is a holiday where I get honestly
most of my works done like I sit down I
check my emails I check YouTube comments
I literally do all my work that I need
to do and I think the reason that I'm so
productive in the morning is because I'm
procrastinating going to the gym so I'm
trying to do every little thing that I
can I also write everything down to my
passion planner that I doesn't need to
do for the day and then for the rest of
the week this is such a good way to kind
of organize your thoughts you're not
trying to tackle everything in life at
one I think that just doing one thing at
a time and focusing on what what you're
doing now what's next is the most
productive way to get things done then I
go to the gym
I do plan to so much immersing really
soon give this video a thumbs up if you
would like to see that but I know that
you guys can be interested but I
basically just go there for an hour and
do cardio or I do a half an hour of
cardio and 30 minutes up strength
training it depends on this day but I
can get into that more depth in another
video like I said just like this video
so I know and for breakfast this morning
I typically have oatmeal every morning
but I don't know why I was really
craving pancakes so I had a full banana
a cup of almond milk and half a cup of
quick cut oats and then I added some of
this organic pea protein powder from
Trader Joe's and I just put a scoop of
that into my whatever mix drink bangs
mean blender I'm so stupid
and then I put it on the pan it makes
about three pancakes I love this recipe
I've made it in so many videos and this
is my PB 2 powder so it's just more of a
low-fat way to have the taste of peanut
butter added to things and I made
probably a good serving or two of that
and just load it on top and it was so so
good
Wow literals so beautiful love that and
that's kind of like the texture that it
looks like when you put into it and then
I just take a shower and I didn't feel
like washing my hair today because I
washed it yesterday so I just did a
coffee scrub in the shower and I cleaned
my face and then right after the shower
I used this hot vegan mask and I wanted
to show you the consistency because it's
so weird annoying but I actually kind of
liked it I don't know it's so weird it's
not what I thought it was when I bought
it but you put it on your face let it
sit for about 15 minutes so in that time
I picked out an outfit you've seen these
shorts a million times on me they're
from Topshop and this is my Calvin Klein
top which I also wear too much and now
I'm just doing my makeup and skincare so
if you want a full skincare routine my
skincare is so so bad even though like I
spend so much time working on it let me
know otherwise this is kind of shown in
a lot of my videos the same product same
rose oil same moisturizers same lush
primer but absolutely comment down below
if you want me to talk more about the
products that I'm showing here if you
like miss something couldn't tell what
it was and I just bought this foundation
it's the CC cream from it cosmetics and
I love it little dark for my skin right
now because I'm kind of pale and then
I'm just going to contour my camera
conveniently died right while I was
contouring and highlighting so you kind
of miss the rest of it but this is what
I do for all of you round face folks out
there like me then I said it and then of
course eyebrows okay story time quickly
I accidentally accidentally lost my
eyebrows too short so I don't know how I
don't remember even doing it but I just
woke up one morning and like a good end
of my eyebrow which gone on both sides
of it what I do so we're working on
growing those back out but it's all good
BAM and that is it thank you for getting
ready to assist me this morning and my
morning routine and comment down below
