channel so today I'm really excited
because I get to show you guys what my
shower routine is and the best part
about the shower routine is that all of
my products are cruelty free which means
that none of them test on animals and
they are all vegan so I'm just so
excited to share these products with you
guys and give any questions about any of
them please leave them down below
without further ado let's just get right
into this video today make sure you
thumbs up if you like it and subscribe
to see more videos to me and yeah
plus one plus we're good into the video
hey you guys so I like to take my
showers in the morning I just like to
start my day off nice and fresh first
things first
gotta get a naked just kidding this is
pg-13 but we do have to party a little
bit okay someone get this drill so of
course the shower is too alright when
you step in you just in the first five
minutes adjusting the water temperature
so I do have pretty thin hair but I have
a lot of it so I do wash my hair every
other day I don't like to let it go too
long without getting shampooed
and I love to use anything that's
basically just hydrating like the turbo
essences shampoo fun fast recently found
out that for glasses is cruelty free
which is really fitting because I love
the 3rd sense okay so this is
embarrassing but I thought I also had a
shark here and I just yeah I'm 20 years
old oh my god I thought I was like a
snow cone or an ice-cream cone here but
I honestly just look like a ballerina
and then wash your shampoo out pretty
self-explanatory here also you guys
comment down below if you think that I
should grow my hair long or cut it short
and also should I diet darker or should
i diet lighter I'm getting it done in a
week and I need to go so here I'm going
to go in with my conditioner of the same
product same smells that I keep it all
pretty similar and whenever I'm putting
conditioner in my hair I would say god
mine's going to run through any knots
that might be in my hair and it just
saves me time later on this is my Holy
Grail face wash and I'm just going to
top my face and let it sit there for a
little bit because the charcoal likes to
kind of sink into my skin and while I do
that I'm going to use my coffee scrub
that I'm obsessed with
I actually just hauled it in my favorite
video so go check that out if you want
to shameless self promo but basically
just leaves my skin feeling really
smooth and just smells really good and
then also this upcoming part I starts to
notice how much water is getting out of
the bathtub which is super funny to me
and now after letting my a conditioner
sit in my hair for as long as I possibly
can I'm going to wash it out and I like
to separate my hair when I do this but
there's no conditioner build-up
underneath the first half of my hair
because I typically happen to like don't
do that and then to end my shower I'm
going to use this body wash it just
leaves me feeling really good about time
I get out of the shower and this is by a
brand that I used to love to buy their
chances
- so check them out everything's gonna
be linked down below for you but chance
I'm out because their products no really
good - and I just like I'm obsessive and
even that smells because it's the most
important thing in the world to me give
this video a thumbs up if you want to
see like a skincare routine and an
organic self tanning routine I would
love to make that for us and follow up
other than that but Q this little outro
that I have some of you and our little
see you later
senator physics for you guys I hope you
enjoyed and please be sure to give a
thumbs up if you liked it and subscribe
