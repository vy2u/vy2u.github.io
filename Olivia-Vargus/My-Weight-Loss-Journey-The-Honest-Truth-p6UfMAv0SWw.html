to my channel so if you do here my name
is live and usually that I'm sitting
right here that means I'm merely talking
get real last time I found here I do a
life update I'm not doing that today
today I want to talk about something
that's just kind of it's really
important to me it's been weighing on my
mind and I just want to put it out there
into the universe in case that it can
help some people I apologize if this
video gets a little bit long a little
bit Randy I appreciate it if you want to
stick around and listen to all of it I
understand if you don't
I think this message will reach some
people and probably other people don't
really care but for the ones that it
does reach I am happy to be able to uh
sit here and talk to you today so hope
that you enjoyed this video but let's
just get right into it so we're going to
be talking about my weight loss today
before I get into today in my life I
want to start off with like where I
started so I was really skinny
genetically growing up I in high school
probably weighs like 100 pounds 110
pounds really really tiny person I did
sports year-round I probably ate
whatever I wanted I wasn't vegan until
about a year and a half ago so body
positivity didn't really affect me until
later I wonder now if I was at a 13 year
old growing up in the social media realm
if I would still have that same like
confidence and that same sense of really
not really caring about food or anything
about any kid back then or if I would be
more aware I think it's pretty obvious
that society's very different now for
thirteen year olds that it was from you
and I was 13 I'm a 20 year old right now
so yeah I mean I just didn't really have
any issues with like what I looked like
I remember like being a little insecure
because I had like a muffin top my whole
life and that's just like your body like
I I was a kid like it didn't really
matter I wasn't like trying to have a
flat stomach I was just like oh he like
look at my baby fat so then around
sophomore year in high school I started
become more aware of my body and like
what others thought of me you know boys
and like you know singing and everything
I wanted to start to look a little bit
better and something that I don't really
want to get into but I will mention is
that I took adderall for my a GED and my
ADHD from seventh grade until junior
year in high school so that is a nap
a suppressive when you start to take out
are all they put you into therapy
because they want to make sure that
you're not going on the drug to lose
weight a lot of people like a lot of
their parents and they start out all
because they are actually in a wreck
sick and they don't want to eat that was
looking for me if you didn't know I
literally have the worst time doing
attention you probably can tell from my
videos that I go off on tangents a
tangent a tangent and I'll probably do
this in videos it was pretty obvious to
tell that I have ADHD junior years oh I
stopped taking the medication because I
decided I didn't want to be on a drug
the rest of my life controlling my brain
it was my own personal choice I have my
doctor my parents backed me up and I
went off the drug and after that I
started gained weight at the same time
another piece of personal information on
its carried on the internet but I hope
that you are kind enough not to judge
before as I started taking birth control
in junior year or senior year of high
school either way both paths cross at
the same time I stopped taking adderall
and I started taking birth control so I
stopped one thing that was making me
lose weight and I started one thing that
was going to make me gain weight because
my birth control ended up making me
gained like 20 pounds and that's not
true for all birth controls don't be
don't think this is medical advice
everybody's different go to a
gynecologist secret and considering
taking birth controls don't be scared by
what I'm saying so then at the same
exact time I stopped doing senior sports
I decide that I want to focus on other
things I quit field hockey
I quit tennis I put everything that I
was doing so I was inactive again so I
basically had a lot of different things
factored into my life at once but I
started to gain weight and I didn't
realize it I didn't really care either
because at the time I was just enjoying
life it was really trendy to like go out
to eat with your friends so we done I
just got my license and all I ever
wanted to do was go hang out my friends
go you know go to cafes go to movies go
eat like it's just kind of a
teenage thing to do and it just kind of
all hit me and I started to gain weight
and it wasn't bad like I wasn't sad but
I was I had fat and I didn't have muscle
I didn't I wasn't fit I wasn't in shape
I wasn't healthy and any means I was
eating like crap and it started to
affect me at the end of senior year more
than anything when I started to like I
have an interest in the boys you if
you're watching and I started to like
get really self-conscious about my life
so
moving on to when I started college I
ended up dating that freshman 15 pretty
quickly I would say it was like a
freshman 20 I don't know I went to a lot
and I just you know you start drinking
pretties like a mall and trashing theirs
but like to be real with you guys like
you you just go out and you do more
things than usual and I was in New City
LA has so many restaurants you're also
feeding yourself for the first time like
I demeanor I was doing whole food top
army became like best friends and thank
you all for for supplying me with my
freshman 15 and honestly but yeah I just
I started gained a lot of weight and I
wasn't happy so that's when I started to
psychologically be affected and that's
when things start to kind of go downhill
for me in my brain I started to try and
work out which is a good thing but I was
doing it as a punishment not as like a
reward to my body for being healthy I
just started to be more afraid of food I
would start calorie counting and I took
one off of my birth control because I
didn't want the hormones in my body and
I was convinced that it made me gain a
lot of weight and it did when I went off
of it I did lose weight and that was
just me my body personally I went vegan
of November of I think it was 2015 and I
went vegan to lose weight and it hurts
my heart so much when people tell me
that they're going vegan to lose weight
because it's not how that happens like
you can go vegan to lose weight and you
know if you work out and like eat right
you will but going vegan is an ethical
choice it's something that you do
because you decide on your own morals
that you don't want to partake in the
unjust system of animal agriculture so
when I would vegan it wasn't for that it
was for losing weight and that was a
mistake because I didn't last and nobody
that goes begin to lose weight last
because you can still be vegan and eat
like and eat God eat too many
calories in a day and it's just kind of
I don't know there was also a lot of
trends two-time high carb low fat and I
was eating like five potatoes a day and
I was just eating a lot which is good
you know food and nourish you but like
I'm saying like it just wasn't for the
right reasons for musical vegan so I
ended up breaking that and I would back
to eating me and a regular my regular
diet before that and then I just kind of
had like a really hard time out
that's what I think things got the worst
for me I started to really become aware
of what I look like in a bathing suit I
think that summer I was the most like
depressed I've ever been about my body
it all kind of started to like hit me at
once that I don't look like models on
Instagram I live in LA and I don't fit
in like I really have a lot of extra fat
in my body I need start working out but
you want results right away so I became
addicted to buying things like weight
loss teeth weight loss coffees
everything that you can imagine and now
I don't endorse odd stuff like but
everything that you can imagine that the
weight loss got big tie that word in
there I bought into and it was so
unhealthy because it's just not it's
it's just not real like if you want to
lose weight it's think about it as
losing side you want to gain muscle you
want to get fit and what your internal
organs to be healthy and that wasn't the
mindset that I had I was like I will do
anything in anything to just get a thin
body and then fast forward to over the
winter of 2016 I think I was working too
many hours I'm a college student I
didn't said I had time to work out my
apartment moving looking at the free gym
I didn't go to it I wasn't motivated and
I still just wanted to lose weight so I
was just scared of calories I wasn't
like I wasn't saving myself right I
wasn't treating myself right so fast
forward to about four months ago when I
finally quit my job and I was like
listen I'm going to put myself first I'm
going to make myself the best version
that I want to be that I've always
wanted to be but have never been able to
achieve I'm going to make it happen I'm
going to happen have it happened by the
summer started working out if you don't
know started I've been vegan this whole
time now that I've been talking I
started really just eating right eating
plant-based I stopped going out to eat
you can watch actually mice like twelve
healthy how this video that's everything
that I did you can watch my fitness
routine that's everything that I do too
but now I want to get into the main part
of why I made this video and this part
I'm going to try and communicate as best
as I can without getting emotional or
anything but
now that I'm starting to like get more
subscribers and like they say clout on
the Internet um I'm getting a lot of
comments that are really nice and really
like flattering and a lot of them are
like your goals your body goals your
perfect your literally everything I want
to be and I never want to be someone
that you watch and compare yourself to I
actually ended up writing down on my
phone everything that I wanted to say
and I'm trying to communicate it the
best that I can but I think it's just
going to be best if I just read it my
phone so I hope that you don't find that
as unauthentic but it is just something
that came at a really vulnerable time at
night that I wrote down and I just want
to communicate that completely to you so
I'm just going to read it alright so
this is how it starts I'm starting to
get more clout and I love that I can
talk to more people and share my ideas
and thoughts and spread and share
positivity and love but I want to say
since it's something really present in
my growth and learning right now that
I'm still coming to terms of who I am
I'm a work in progress just like
everyone else I don't want to be your
goals or someone's unattainable image
for you I want to be completely honest
and let you guys know that I'm a really
sensitive human and I feel things really
strongly something that I've been
struggling with my whole life is my body
image and if you see my pics and stuff
and you're like but you're so skinny
because I get that comment a lot it's
because I hide all of my insecurities I
know how to pose I know which pictures
post of myself that I look the best in
but if you meet me in person you might
be surprised that I'm not always posing
and I'm not always like sticking my legs
out to look super long but I actually
have like really bad posture and a
resting bitchface
and really really chubby cheeks I want
to say this because I get a lot of
anxiety about it and about being true to
myself especially with the more
attention and clouds that I gain I'm
someone who is not only working on my
outer appearance and being healthy but
I'm working on my inner emotions too so
if you look up to me at all and consider
me a role model please don't let it be
for my appearances fashion and aesthetic
are really cool and a part of who I am
but I mainly want to be a role model for
all things relating to positivity and
health I'm going to continue to grow and
be the best me that I can and
excited for life and how I can mold a
future based on my own desire to work
hard and set goals
I would rather you look at me an
inspiration for someone who worked hard
to get what they wanted I aspire to be
fit and I trained and learned and fail
and succeeded and failed again many
times I just kept working at it I'd
rather be your mind set goals and your
body goals I'm sorry that I'm bringing
this all for my phone okay I really need
because of it there's a lots of some
computing I want to show you what
determination and patience can get you
it's hard because when I film videos
sometimes there's so much pressure to be
perfect and especially with things from
social media there's so many people so
why would you take advice from someone
who's teaching you how to be sit if
they're not fit you know I mean like you
would rather click on someone on some
video that's in shade so why would you
take advice from me when I'm not perfect
I don't have a six-pack yet or a huge
butt or anything like that so why would
you choose me over the perfect fitness
model so I just hope that what you see
in gain from watching my videos isn't
someone who has achieved perfection I'm
not someone who was born this way
genetically and I'm not at my goals yet
but I'm on my way there so when you
watch my videos I hope that instead of
looking after someone you consider
perfect you look up to someone who is
just like you and he was working towards
their goals like you and learning and
sharing along the way I will get to
where I want to be and you will get to
where you want to be it but I just
wanted to put this message out there to
tell everyone not and I'm so happy that
I have you guys on this journey with me
and that I get to share it with you guys
so then I ended up I think like continue
to shine to make the day great but it's
so cheesy so I'm not going to say that
but I'm going to say that if you watch
this video I hope that you know you just
got something from it that you hear me
tell you that I'm not perfect I show you
what I want you know the internet
internet to see but there's a lot of me
that isn't perfect and I'm
self-conscious every day and I'm
learning to treat food as nutrition and
to make me stronger rather than being
afraid of it um I feel a little bit
closer to those who did watch this so I
hope that you feel closer to me as well
and chop more in the comments below I'm
sure I'll have more to add in my comment
that I post every time I post a new
video I like post comment anyway so I'm
sure I'll have more two out there that I
didn't think to say here but I feel good
getting this off my chest you guys thank
you for listening and I hope you have a
beautiful day you need to make your day
beautiful by the way it doesn't just
happen like you have to like put that
effort in so put that effort in today
