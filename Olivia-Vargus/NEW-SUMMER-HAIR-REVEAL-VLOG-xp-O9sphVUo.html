channel since I am going to film a
little bit every vlog for you okay my
hair right now is Queen and Michael what
is going on um so I filmed some blog
clips this morning but I was a little
bit crazy and a little bit jet-lagged in
them so I'm brave if I'm feeling a
little frisky I'll put them in this you
can see what my morning consisted of my
arms off quick mmm
I can't feel the side of my face or this
anyways um today my first day back home
I hasn't been home in six months and my
entire morning has just been appointment
after appointment up there appointment
and it started with getting my blood
drawn and that I had to go to the
dentist and just do a regular checkup
for then they had to fill or fix the
cavity that I had literally done months
years ago maybe
and so they novocaine and numbed my
entire mouth so this morning my mouth is
just been um I haven't eaten literally
all day one thing it's 2:00 in the
afternoon now and now best part of my
day trip week life I get to go get my
calcium supplement that I have under my
tongue removed here hopefully clicking
out of the vlog buy enough to do like
this goes crazy but I literally have a
calcium stone under my plans that I've
had for decently four years and I'm
going to go and get it removed
finally I've been procrastinating at my
whole life because I'm just scared of
the surgery I don't think it's serious
at all it's not life-threatening or
anything it's nothing to worry about I
really don't know what's about to happen
like I think I should prep myself for
this more like I should know what I'm
getting myself into but I don't
so I'm yeah hey guys so it's me again
oh my god I don't know what just
happened I'm going to make this short
and quick because I'm having a difficult
time right now but I have three shots of
snow became under my tongue surgery was
a success I basically had a purl am I
going to earth to purl under my tongue
and then just call removed I will update
you later because I can't talk right now
whoo okay a little bit of an update it's
around five o'clock right now so some of
the novocaine I started to wear off
enough that like I think I can go and
make myself something to eat which is
grapes I have not eaten all day and I
was on plane all day yesterday so been a
really fun trip home for me so far I
wish I could be that content like at any
moment in life
you all I did not expect today to go
like this like I really didn't realize
how much pain I would be in for the rest
of the day after these two things I had
to do this morning so I'm just going to
drink some water right now I'm getting
my hair cut and colored tomorrow and I
have a Baldy on appointment with this
girl that like I've been going through
my whole life basically so she was the
only person that I trust and I'm so
trying to say what I want to do for my
hair some between something exist like
Tessa folks hair color others this where
it's darker up top and light down bottom
for something or something like this
where she has literal like blonde ends
with just dark top so I know you're all
super interested in what I'm eating in a
day so I'm going to show you what I just
had for dinner now that I'm finally
starting to get my health back I just
had this from Whole Foods and it was so
good I eat the whole thing there's two
servings in here then no surprise I have
two brownie Clif Bar I was just really
craving it and you know you should treat
yourself yellow so
the times that anxious to go out in
public out of fear that I'm going to run
into someone from like a school or just
anyone that I know I'm going to run into
parents log on time
well family so we're just being out in
nature this easily and not having to
drive an hour I feel like you can work
showing the menu here because the most
basic menu for like any Cape Cod
restaurant and in the ocean yeah in such
a way this is the aesthetics of all of
Cape Cod basically it's honestly amazing
that I'm vegan and I grew up here
because all nothing here is the DC food
I'm not going to buy that looks so good
but morally I just can't do it myself
I'm sure with level Fijian know I know I
think about every day but again of my
mouth so much saying that I don't want
to eat anything else are you eat dinner
you guys wanna happy I'm happy
in Concord all my water just got home
I'm so bundled up right now so happy we
got to blankets on the web and living
the life I'm drinking my water is my
third bottle of like 32 ounces of water
I like to drink every day finishing this
up and then I want to figure out what I
wanted my hair like I'm so torn between
dyeing it lighter on the at like just
completely dying the ponytail blonde and
keeping this ground or just going dark
but I don't know alright well good night
until I see you tomorrow the next day so
I'm going to get my hair done right now
I still have absolutely no idea what I
want to do with my hair which is the
problem because I'm supposed to be there
in 15 minutes and I tell her what I want
but I don't know the big hair reveal
 I'm starting to lean
towards going blonde we're here okay the
moment of truth alright you guys I did
it I went blonde kind of I did ombre so
basically I kept all my natural hair
color and then we died at the end blonde
and then they toned it so it's like more
golden and I love it I don't have much
like makeup on you mascara right now so
I used tell just how I like it and do my
makeup I also go as far as to cut when I
just want to trim and I just kept it
really like the same length because I
want to grow it out and see what my hair
looks like long anyways I will see you
guys Sunday with an all new video thank
you for watching bye
