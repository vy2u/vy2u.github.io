channel I'm going to be filming a night
routine for you guys and kind of like a
vlog style so right now it is 8 p.m. and
I'm just going to take you kind of
through what I do every night basically
like I don't know I want to share this
to the guys because I feel like I really
cherish my night routines in my morning
routines because they're really the same
everyday so right now my friends are up
on the roof of my building hanging out
so I'm gonna go hang out with them and
Winry you as a theme let's go
hi come up here one two I can Krogman
give up UI because they move me at my
apartment when I smell something and I
have like why is the lighting so green
even in life maybe we could it's for
2000 what look she's gonna see how many
pieces of watermelon she can fit in our
mouth okay well are you counting them
like how many is that it was like chubby
bunny but like you know say what do you
got here Kiana she's a child I was that
remind you of Selena alright so right
now we're having a cute little family
dinner but I'm not eating because if you
saw a couple of the unicorn crap video
and it literally was so gross I don't
eat for them but they made like cookout
so say honestly you guys are a lot like
that pretty extra alright so I just got
back downstairs
and I'm going to get ready to go work
out right now and I'll show you guys my
workout routine that I do every single
night and the outfit that I wear to the
gym today okay so my outfit to the gym
is just this like black tank top I don't
know where it's from but it's just a
black tank top and then I have my
Victoria Secret sports leggings on you
know you know and then I have on my Nike
sneakers I don't know like what kind
they are but they're great so you know
then comment below me there and yeah so
I'm going to film at the gym just
because it's like kind of points to
bring it down there just for just one
thing that I do I'm going to film I get
back up here but basically all I do at
the gym is I use the elliptical for an
hour and I watch youtube videos I'm on
the optic Oaks it's like the pass of
time because I get so bored while
working out so I need like something
more than music to like entertain me
yeah so I'm there for an hour I don't do
any specific things I just kind of run
until like I'm done and then I'll come
back up here and I'll show you guys
everything else that I do yeah
so I also like to take off my makeup
before working out otherwise I feel like
it literally makes me break out and I'm
also my period right now not to make
excuses for my
so but I think it's contributing to the
fact that I'm extremely lazy right now
and I really don't want to go do this
but I'm going to meet myself because
it's everyday so I'm going to use this
yes to coconut but it's really the best
stuff ever I talked about it in my
favorites video go check that out if you
haven't but I'm just going to take off
on my makeup and then we'll be good to
go take this and you look compared to me
thing and then I'm going to rehydrate
your skin as you take off your makeup so
it's amazing I look so gross I'm so
sorry but I did just finish I just
finished an hour on the elliptical I'm
not gonna lie you guys today was harder
than usual because I have the worst
period crabs like it oh my god it's
making me so enabled to like freaking
move but now I usually switch on and off
between leg days and upper body dive and
I always come back upstairs to my room
to do this stuff could mention small but
I'm going to do leg day I'm going to
show you guys like what I do and I do
circuit training so I don't get like
tired of it so basically I'm just going
to do 20 sets wats 25 on each side of
like side lunges and then I do 20 side
of each side of forward lunges and then
I do 25 sumo squats and then I'd repeat
3 times and that's it I keep my workouts
I come I keep my workouts like really
simple because if I take them
complicated I won't do them every day
and I want to do it every day because
they say that if you do like 10,000
steps a day
for like like every day basically for a
week and you lose a pound a week so I
why I do the elliptical for an hour and
then I do like other stuff and so I'm
kind of try to lose like that I don't
know I'm trying to be healthy for the
summer and just for life in general so
now that's done and now I get to relax
tonight and I also stretch after every
workout with just like regular stretches
like Tetris oh that kind of stuff also I
want to address because I don't think I
did before but I usually always have
dinner like around five six o'clock and
then I work out about eight o'clock so I
don't eat after dinner for like the rest
of the night and I kind of like I don't
fast I don't even do it purposefully but
I'm not hungry
but from like five or six o'clock you
told like basically I wake up the next
morning and I like during coffee and
water is like around ten o'clock the
next time I don't eat just because it
gives my stomach time so like digest
everything that's in it from the day
before and kind of reset for the next
time so that's just personally what I
like to do I recommend you try it like
in a healthy way obviously don't like
not eat for like a long time if you need
to eat but yeah and then I also I didn't
eat dinner tonight because I had a
really big like açaí bowl at like 3
o'clock I'm wearing my favorite sleep
shirt which is just like a giant long
Mac men's extra-large champions shirt um
also I'm pretty sure that my roommates
asleep right now so I'm talking really
quietly I guess I didn't expect and I
chose to make this like a vlog type
video that she would fall asleep and I
wouldn't be able to talk to the camera
but we're going to roll a bit shoutout
myself for being an idiot and shout out
you guys for not hating me for like not
having any makeup on for like better
half of this video okay so like I said
we have some water I'm probably going to
drink like only that much more before I
go to bed kind of lot I'm kind of just
shopping online right now I don't really
have anything I need to do but I'm like
super awake I might have gotten a little
bit carried away but don't worry guys
I'm not ordering that but like if you
don't already shop it Sorella
you should check it out because they're
visiting my favorite brand right now I'm
obsessed with everything that they have
so I'm using this heating pad I don't
know what the brand is but it's actually
really nice my mom sent this to me so
thank you mom I'm definitely getting a
lot of use out of this but it's so nice
and just using it for cramps right now
and it definitely helps like it
definitely definitely helps
so if you guys struggle with cats like I
do give this a try</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
