to my channel if you're new here my name
is live and today I'm gonna be doing a
outfits of the week for school when I
was in high school I pretty much own
like twelve different pairs of forever21
that just plain got leggings and I would
switch them out every day and wear the
same pair of boots and just different
tops and that was basically my entire
high school wardrobe now that I'm in
college and I go to a fashion school
though I am a lot more into fashion but
I still wear just a lot of leggings and
a lot of sweatshirts and just
comfortable in swimming school the most
important thing for me when I'm putting
together an outfit school is comfort
because you're gonna be sitting in the
classrooms all day long so that is at
the top of my priority list if you also
want to see excited by natural quick and
easy makeup look through school I just
uploaded that last week so I will have
it on the screen right here for a second
and you can check that out so this video
is not sponsored but it is in
collaboration with this really cool
brand that I found called zoo shoo and
they sent me some shoes that I'm gonna
include in the outfits and and the best
part is that at the end we have put
together a giveaway so two people are
gonna be winning $100 gift cards to
their website so stay tuned to the end
and I will give you the giveaway rules
for that but for now let's get including
them alright you guys so I'm going to
walk you through the outfits that I have
picked out for you so this is gonna be
my Monday outfit and this skirt was
drifted recently and I'm so in love with
it it's actually really comfortable you
can find denim skirts just about
anywhere nowadays like Urban Outfitters
has really good ones that I like this
belt is from brandy melville and I just
picked it up and I'm obsessed with it I
love wearing belts it just adds to an
alpha it makes it look like you threw on
something and put a lot of time and
effort into it and my sweatshirt I'm
also in love with it was a gift from my
best friend Ally and it's from Free
People and it has stars on the side and
you guys kind of know like stars are my
thing so I'm obsessed with this the
material is so soft in this outfit will
just be so perfect for school
these shoes are from the zoo shoe and
I've never owned a wear white pair of
boots but I really love these
Tuesday's outfit is a black turtleneck
from brandy melville and it's really
lightweight so it's perfect for sitting
in class because you won't get too hot
in it you also will get enough warmth
out of it the shorts are from a hall
that I gave a staff of a while ago and
my belt is from Topshop
I'm obsessed with this outfit black and
white is my go-to always the shoes are
from zoo shoe and these are really cute
tan shoes that I'm obsessed with the
heels are not hard to walk in I would
never wear hard to walk in shoes to
school because I'm once again lazy but
they're actually really great oh wait we
started the next outfit already okay so
this top is from brandy melville I'm
sorry I'm so behind so the top is when
brandy melville it's really really white
so it's like blindingly bright but
that's okay
the belt that I'm wearing is from a
holiday of its awfull as well really
like it I wear it a lot you've probably
seen a lot and okay trying to be cute
and now oh yeah I already talked to us
about live like move on please okay the
jeans are from Sorella
love them but they are definitely too
big so I have to wear them with about
kind of sad about that and then I was
kind of feeling myself in these clips
and I don't regret it because look it
I'm happy okay and now I'm wearing my
zoo shoe boots love these ones they're
really comfortable they're a black suede
but it's kind of hard to tell but
they're actually really comfortable to
walk in which is again important to me
and now again we obviously love
high-waisted denim up in here so we have
on these bdg jeans from Urban Outfitters
this top is from brandy melville and I
want to get it in white too because I
really like the look it's the comfort of
it it's literally like the most
versatile top ever and these shoes are
one my favorite ones that I got from zoo
shoes they are Steve Madden shoes but
they have these cute slits on the side
so they're actually really cute and add
a little bit of a flare to any outfit
and then I cut my jeans to be ugly I put
some effort in and so now it is the
weekend so this is my Friday night
outfit you can wear this during the day
to just don't worry the heels that I
have on
but this top was actually thrifted so I
don't know where you can get it but the
skirt is from
see in a second but it is from fashion
Nova and I'm obsessed with it oh I guess
because I didn't show the skirt sure
okay so these are my shoes that are from
zoo shoe and I really like them there oh
I was way too easy to tie them up yep
that is exactly the kind of person that
I am I'm sorry zoo shoe you probably
hate me but today and now this is my
Saturday morning out of it because we
had a pretty good time last night and
today we just wanna be comfortable not
really talk to anybody not really see
what anybody totally understandable like
trying to be cute and funny but it does
I'm gonna work
now we're always of course staying lit
no matter what but yeah it's just
basically a oversized brandy melville
sweatshirt I wear this all the time in a
lot of instagrams my sunglasses are from
Free People which I love that is the
epitome of who I am as a person right
there this clip right now it's great

uncomfortable ok so this is my 100%
classic live outfit pink top is from
brandy melville shorts are from Topshop
and the sweatshirt thing that I have on
is from Sorella love this outfit I
always feel so good when I wear this
outfit again guys I want to say what I
haven't still meant that the necklaces
that I'm wearing all my videos are from
a boutique that I used to work at so you
can't get them online if you see a piece
of hair on my sleeve while live Wow way
