from 8 a.m. until 10 p.m. I would three
hour break in between one of them and
yeah my life is just a never-ending
series of like what's not sure should I
wear today so I have never once dressed
up for this class in my life and when I
put those movies for just five minutes
it's the body shop with Chinese ginseng
and rice clarifying polishing mask this
stuff like just smells so good it's a
really therapeutic and it's supposed to
be brightening and good for your acne I
don't like to wear makeup to classes and
so and also washing it off is gonna wake
me up so we love that so what's new a
few guys obviously you guys know I had
to make something with the word thrive
on it my marriage is coming out this
Monday and I'm so excited
okay there's took my face mask off it's
like a warm wet face cause it makes my
skin feel so smooth and I just put my
native deodorant on so because I'm
trying to be a consistent bitch this
year and I've never consistent I bought
the same line cuz this is the mask and
what the same toner that goes with the
mask cuz she said it would help my acne
in like my uneven skin tone so again
it's the body shop Chinese ginseng and
rice this just smells so good I'm sure
it like does fun stuff to your skin too
but mainly just like smells and feels
good because it's ginseng so it's just
like I don't know invigorating honestly
my coffee is you're sitting here all sad
I'm very blessed that I don't have a lot
of a.m. classes in fact I only have
I value my morning routine so my morning
routine on school days it's completely
out the window it's not the same as any
other day of the week I don't know why I
spent so much money on this eye cream
but look at how cool it is then I'm also
gonna use the Korres rose oil and it
gives me like such a good glow this
literally smells like summer to me and
then the only makeup that I put on is my
eyebrows like I'm literally not going to
put anything else on because I'm just
gonna be sitting in class all day I'm
gonna put on this hourglass pencil I'm
so hungry
after I go brush my teeth because I
can't until I finish my coffee I'm gonna
put on this Burt's Bees lip balm with
kokum butter I don't know what kokum
butter is but this stuff is so so
hydrating nice you guys it get more and
more loving every single day my heart is
literally full for eternity like I just
so I only have ignored ten minutes left
but I need Chuck this water right now so
I just poured the rest of that water
into this Camelback I'm gonna bring to
class and I'm also going to bring these
overnight oats that I prepped this week
to class so I genuinely didn't think I
was gonna put my big oMG a jacket on but
it's just so cold and also this jacket
is so good for wearing to class and then
underneath it we have our thrive crew
nuts and then I have my black Air Force
Ones on and these are high tops so this
is an all buck really dark look today I
also have these ki-- Sonny's and they're
like the big ones that I call my Kris
Jenner honey and then my book bag is
from Urban Outfitters and then my
Camelback and I have everything I'm
gonna go early because I like to get the
same see every week last week someone
took my seat it's not happening in this
week nope
like this video if you think that I
should drop out
thanks I just changed all of my merch
mmm
the merchants will sir release on Monday
I like this I just don't love it and
that's the issue like I need to love it
it wasn't enough like it's just so
thrive I just felt like I just wanted it
to be really really special
I feel so about my distributors gonna
 hate me so in between class
right now I'm gonna eat a banana and
this Clif Bar it's around 11 o'clock and
I actually have one more hour until my
next class so I have some time to go I
mean class number two table you know
probably I mean who cares okay so I just
got home from class and it's a round
three in the afternoon oh so now I have
a three hour break in between this class
and my 7 p.m. class and I have to do the
homework for 7 p.m. class and I also
think that I want to go work out
once a class was there for like an hour
and the teacher thought I was out early
so high it's only 8 o'clock right now
so I usually get out of that class at
like 9:45 so without even hesitating
you're sitting down I'm gonna put on my
workout clothes and go downstairs clay
didn't get to do that today working out
was living my therapy I need to go like
Belize this stress right now okay so I
showed this in my morning routine but
I'm just gonna take some of my
pre-workout from women's best I'm not
gonna take a whole scoop just cuz it's
late and I don't know if this is gonna
keep me up or not but this is kind of my
pre-workout with tradition and then
right after that I prepped my BCA so
this repairs your muscles as you work
out
so I just took a really really nice hot
shower it's a just the best way to end
your night like I put on my Trader Joe's
lavender a body scrub it's a nice and a
little bit to that I feel refreshed I'm
whispering my legs I think their weights
asleep so also for the body job I got
this tea tree anti perfection night mask
and she said you can use this every
single night what sold me on it the
consistency is so cool it's like jello I
didn't wash my hair because I know I'm
going to workout in the morning tomorrow
so I didn't want to like have to wash it
twice so I hope you guys enjoyed this
realistic college day in my life
if you want to see a more fun put the
other kind of neat because they follow
me on my social medias and subscribe for
a better concept in the future than this
this is just my college life right now
anyways I love you guys so much for
watching I hope there's an amazing day
and I'll talk to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
