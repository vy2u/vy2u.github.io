embrace my natural body because God made
me this way for a reason just kidding

just like what am i so I've decided I
really love San Francisco's like
downtown area and like a few minutes ago
we were talking about this but like if
downtown LA was as nice as this you
would never hear me complaining about it
but I'm okay but I'm always complaining
about that entirely because it's so like
trash and like just disgusting and
crowded but the downtown San Francisco
is like so like open and nice and it's
like a Boston but also like a New York
Hill and it's just so so calm I love it
like this is a city are you kidding me
all right I don't really know where
we're going next but I have eaten so
much in the past like two weeks and
haven't worked out and make the past two
weeks

the Golden Gate Bridge but it's like
covered and saw do be just occur to know
