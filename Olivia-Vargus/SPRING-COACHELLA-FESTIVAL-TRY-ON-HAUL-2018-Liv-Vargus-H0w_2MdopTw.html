channel so today we'll be doing a little
bit of a cultural alcohol-free oh and if
you're not going to Coachella that's
okay you can still wear the stuff in the
spring a lot of it it's really cute so
I'm gonna say to show you it I also
don't think I've said it yet but I'm
actually going to Coachella with dope
which is the shopping app that everyone
is obsessed with right now basically
what it is is just like a giant online
shopping mall so you can shop from a
bunch of places at once and add like
different stores to your car at the same
time and order everything at one I just
obviously want to give them a huge shout
out because they are the best they also
sent out a bunch of flower crowns as a
part of their like official invite to
the Dotel up by the way and all sort of
really matters but I'm not really doing
any makeup today because I have an
eyelash appointment tonight okay so the
first outfit that I'm sure you are from
princess Polly so the first thing is
this two piece set that is so perfect
for Coachella so the top is a bando and
it ties in the back and in the bottom is
just a plain shirt it's a really nice
color of red and the best part about
this is obviously the print on it it has
silver and gold bedazzled little prints
and I just think it's so cute the skirt
is a little bit vague but what I did is
I ordered a waist belt that is also a
fanny pack from princess Polly that I'm
gonna wear with it and you won't be able
to tell if the skirt is a little big at
the waist and it will stay up where it
needs to so I'm really excited for that
full outfit to finally come together oh
by the way don't send me these two
outfits because they're so kind and
amazing and sweet as well No
so the next thing that I got is this
white top and this things are really
pretty you can tie them around your arm
and it's just this like boho effortless
look that's gonna be really easy to wear
and I can't wait and I got that to go
with this black skirt and this skirt is
so comfortable it is also again a little
bit thick at the waist I always forget
that like I have a small waist but then
like my bottom size is like bigger so
I'm just gonna wear it belt with this
and I will also just fold it up and make
it more flattering so the next thing I
want to show you is everything I got
from Topshop at the Grove so the first
thing is this pair of yellow shorts and
you can't tell me
these aren't absolutely amazing I love
wearing yellow because it's just such a
weight color and I know if they have
this in their mom jeans and they stole
it out of my size and in store so I saw
it in shorts and I was like that's so
perfect and I'm gonna wear this so much
during the spring and summer too not
just at Coachella so I can't wait and
then I thought that it would be cute
with this bando just a plain white crop
top and it's actually one size too big
because again everyone is sold out of
everything cause it's Coachella season
but I mean it's just a plain white bando
and I think that with this and then
obviously lots of accessories it'll be
perfect
and I also pick up this really cool arm
cuff that I just think will look cool in
photos honestly so this bathing suit
that I got a Topshop is actually the
most amazing thing ever and it's the
most me thing I've ever seen in my
entire life
so it's this black one piece and all
over it it has bedazzled and embroidered
stars and just cosmic like shapes and
stuff I don't want to call it so the
next week's that I went to it was Planet
blue and they have a lot of like boho
stuff and really good festival clothing
they are a little bit more pricey but I
wanted to find like the perfect girly
boho romper this romper fits like a
dream it has an open spot in the middle
which just makes it feel a lot more
summery but I love the print on it
I liked it this is like a really girly
feminine look but I'm gonna pair it with
like I'm highs top Air Force Ones and
like some movie chunky jewelry and just
like make it really edgy so the next
place that I went to was Urban
Outfitters obviously not wearing this as
a festival but just like for lounging
around while I'm there because I just
want to make sure that I have like warm
clothing for nighttime because I heard
that it gets really cold there in the
desert at nighttime and I also bought a
pair of matching Tommy Hilfiger
sweatpants and these are awesome
actually wore this together as an outfit
to go and get my hair done the other day
and a lot of people's yummy as saying
that they liked it with the red shirts
on the side match the sweatshirt so it's
perfect even though this isn't Tommy
Hilfiger and lastly I want to show you
everything that I got at Sephora in prep
for Coachella because it's obviously
gonna be so hot in desert and I actually
don't burn easily I get really tan
I think it's you guys like I do have a
little bit of like Greek skin in me that
maybe that's why I stand
nicely but I would still wanted to
protect against Sun because you never
know so first thing that I picked up was
the supergroup unseen sunscreen and this
has SPF 40 it this also works I was like
a makeup primer so that's why I really
liked it so I was asking the worker that
I Taylor who shot you you're amazing I
love you you got me get the supergroup
it defends refresh setting mist and this
has SPF 50 I have the Urban Decay
settings breeze but he told me that
those are the alcohol in them and they
were not going to be good for wearing to
Coachella because it's gonna obviously
make your skin dry out more and
everything so if you told me that this
is amazing so you can shake it and then
like spritz it in a circle on your face
and then like get it in your hairline
and it won't get oily or anything that's
what I was afraid was gonna do but he
said I wasn't fine and I've been testing
out these two things all week and I
really like them so then he sold me on
this which is the supergroup Sun defying
sunscreen oil I didn't need sunscreen so
I already opened some but this is for
your body and what's good about this is
I'll show you it on but basically it
just kind of looks like an oil on your
skin so it makes your skin look super
moisturized and super nice and it
doesn't like it doesn't feel greasy it
dries down but it makes your skin look
so glowy and then lastly he was like you
should try out the Fenton beauty this is
the brand new body love a body
illuminizer and this looks so amazing on
the skin the one thing about this and I
watched Jeffery stars review on it last
night after I already purchased it and
he said that it doesn't dry down so it
stays really oily so I'm thinking I
might not wear this to the actual
festival because I don't want Stan
blowing on my skin and then like getting
stuck to me if this is staying oily so
I'll publish
reddit's and photos around the do't
houses and yeah so that is everything
that I want to haul for you guys today I
do have more clothing coming in the mail
from princess Polly and I'm
let that be a surprise to you guys don't
know what all of my Coachella outfits
are gonna be just yet but if you like
