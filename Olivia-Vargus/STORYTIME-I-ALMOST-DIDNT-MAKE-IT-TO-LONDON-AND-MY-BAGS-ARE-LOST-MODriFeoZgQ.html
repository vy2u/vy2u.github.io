about London um I would put the camera
up higher but I don't have any I want
something that's a good idea
so this is gonna be a little story time
about our trip to London because I
haven't vlogged anything up until here
because I was so excited like vlog like
the plane and everything and then that
just kind of was a train wreck
yeah like yeah exactly we're delusional
right now because we're jet-lagged it's
also 11 o'clock we haven't eaten a
single thing we're mentally exhausted
physically exhausted we have no clue
what's going on
we had technically we miss dinner
because it's like the morning it's like
9:00 a.m. in LA we don't know what's
going on right now so we don't make any
sense but we wanted to sit on and like I
want to start blogging this trip so I
was like I need to start with the
background story of what's going on so
that you guys can understand I've been
kind of saying things on my Instagram
stories in my Twitter but like no one
really knows what's going on so let's
just start the day off at 8:00 a.m. on
the 20th which was Monday right so I get
an uber I'm super excited with London I
get to the airport I am taking a
Southwest flight from LAX to San
Francisco at like 11:00 in the morning
and then our flight in San Francisco she
lives in San Francisco so I'm gonna meet
her there
our flight in San Francisco leaves to go
to London at 6:00 p.m. I had to make it
to San Francisco sorry I didn't get to
San Francisco I had to get my luggage
and then meet with her and then go to
Trevor backs again to get an X plane and
we had plenty of times to do this but
then my flight gets delayed like 30
minutes yeah it wasn't bad and we won't
panic attack that we were freaking out
we're like oh my god like and then all
of a sudden it gets delayed another like
30 minutes so now it's an hour late so
we're starting to freak out and we're
like it can't be delayed a second more
right Friday now told my parents I was
like guys it's still late an hour and
they were like I only like it's an hour
like we were just like overly cautious
the time which is good we needed to be
yeah
so because we hadn't even thought until
my plane got delayed we hadn't even
thought about the possibility of Mila
just somehow I'm not making it salmon
let's go because that was just like an
easy yeah it's an hour flight it's like
a movie today right
like it was just like the first like
easy part of the trip that we had to get
through this is the hardest yes we get
on the plane actually I play she's not
with me I'm alone I get on my plane
I'm sitting down I'm like I'm on the
plane I'm good to go look we're getting
we're getting out to the runway
I put gum in my mouth I'm like we're
pulling back from the gate I'm about to
you know my ears gonna pop on the air
like I'm ready to go my headphones are
in they all of a sudden stop the plane
and they're like everyone off the plane
because the weather in San Francisco was
raining so I get off the plane and I
text Ali and now we're like panic mode
we're actually like not sure what's
going on yeah so and then I'm looking at
the weather report and it's only
supposed to rain more as the time goes
on like it goes for my 50% to like 100%
so then it gets too late into 2:30 and
now we're like doing the math in our
heads number like I'm gonna lay I'm
gonna have this map time to get my
luggage and we have this my time date
and it's like going so that leaves a
hours so now it's like 1:30 ish good at
giving us information but all of a
sudden they go so everybody on the
flights been canceled I have a flight to
London at 6:00 p.m. what do you mean my
flights been cancelled the San Francisco
this was supposed to be the easiest part
of the trip it's overweight I'm eating
in this line for like an hour waiting to
talk to the service desk lady to be like
what can I do and so meanwhile her mom
who's a goddess and she's also like
she's just very like Olivia this is what
I'm gonna do it like she's got it so now
I'm just in state of like panic innings
anxiety I'm like I'll do whatever you
tell me to and so she was like we're
looking at other airlines right now like
we're gonna try and get you in on her
flight and I was like I don't know how
because if it's raining like no flame
like no planes can land there no they
would and the price yeah in the price
like $900 I'll be like me it was last
minute because me mom my mom is at work
like I'm texting my mom my mom has like
no idea that I'm texting her because
she's at work and she can't text she's a
nurse so her mom's like helping us out
through all this and she's like okay
lived this is what you're gonna do I
booked you on play on America no sorry I
butchered by it on Virgin America and it
leaves in like 45 minutes you need to
get your bags from South West because I
had checked them get your ass through
security at Virgin America and get on
that plane she did get her bags back so
I get up to the hoped I was like listen
I know there's no flights I don't leave
me Southwest like we knows information
already we've been talking to people on
the phone from cell phone cessful day I
need you to to expedite my bags off the
plane and get them to me right now
and I need to get out of here and she
was like okay like let me calm and fast
like I let go like she's like okay so
you can go downstairs and I'm gonna get
your back it's gonna take 30 minutes
okay so I run downstairs and I'm like
waiting baggage scanner like wish I do
so I'm like I can't understand looking
back in for the to baggage
bag belt cuz she said it's gonna come
from one of those and like it's not
coming so it's been like five minutes
and I'm still freaking out so I run into
the the like a service center and I'm
like I need my bounce right now I
neither not like we're like trying to
get the bags but doing those little
phone calls so I get outside the gate
and I'm on the phone valium I don't
think it's gonna work man like it's not
and then all of a sudden equate Ali
humor Alex I was a mid conversations
between I see my bags I grab it and this
is like the funniest part of the whole
thing was that's my giant 50-pound check
bag and my little steel 50-pound like um
try will carry on running from the
southwest the first term on Alex all the
way across the in topic all the way
across LAX by foot so I couldn't take a
car by foot to Virgin America runs like
it's terminal six so it's a it's an
entire circle so it's across the airport
I don't know because I have my two bags
they're falling everywhere run across
I literally run to the desk and I'm like
here's my like boarding pass I run
through security and get to the gate and
I like 20 minutes I'm like I like 20
minutes like free time I'm like okay
then I get on plane I'm like when I land
it's gonna be like five thirty yeah and
I have to get on my I have to board at
6:00 on the next play but she also has
to wait for her luggage weren't like you
people like if anybody's fun like you
know it takes like 30 minutes for them
to get your bags onto the thing examine
of them so now we're like in the next
set of panic mode and I'm like I'm not
gonna make this flight so meanwhile so I
was gonna lose service when I went up in
the air and I wasn't gonna have any
contact with them I want to show them
the texts I sent you oh my god wait
until about okay love you have a safe
flight and then it goes all of these
call me when you get off your flight and
she goes landed so the entire flight I
literally was just like sitting there
like when we landed like I had no music
and they guy was just staring everyone
else like relaxed and I'm like
so I gotta get a place also my emergency
see but he gave me oh yeah I put lemon
in emergency like when I was when I was
boarding because we had aboard it last
minute
I guess they gave me the seat that's
like the emergency exit you have to be
like qualified to sit there and so I'm
born again she goes ma'am are you
qualified or are you comfortable in case
of an emergency to be in control of like
the plane or whatever it goes on and I
literally look at her and I had no idea
I had that seat so I was like I was
actually prepared to die because I can
do my luck we're flying in terrain I'm
in the emergency and in order this is
why it's gonna go down and I'm gonna be
on the one flight of the moon to fly it
sort of thing I'm gonna be on the one
flight that like goes down and I'm an
emergency exit and I came in charge of
keeping everyone alive and I can't do
this I had no clue when I went up in the
flight like what was gonna happen when I
landed but I was like trying to figure
it out and I was like worst comes to
worst I'm just gonna run to the terminal
like five foot which we figured out was
at a 15 minute run or walk when I run it
time not even it was like it wouldn't
watch for the guy that was checking my
back I was like will she be able to make
it he look he ded us looked me in the
eye like not confident on he goes there
it opposite sides of the airport like I
honestly don't know she'll make it and
I'm like oh I get off the plane I sure
like all these different things to do I
was like get your back and run over
there like you have to catch this
AirTrain thing I had a heart attack when
I read that because yeah I'm not gonna
get on new arena and get you it wouldn't
happen other things my mom was like tell
her to get on the air train below and I
look at her and like mom like no wing
will live like she'll get on the wrong
one or she won't get off at the right
stop or like something just like
everything is gonna go wrong the guy at
the counter that was checking my bag was
like oh yeah like she doesn't have until
6:45 to check her bags she only has
until 5:45 to check her bags and I was
like wait but and I'll and I landed my
plane landed back there yep so the new
plan told him the new plan the new plan
was I take sleep and I go
new plan once you get off the plane call
me and you're not gonna get your bags
and you're gonna go straight my parents
stayed at the airport so they could
drive her from one side of the airport
to the other side of the airport and
don't get your bad okay so I get off the
plane and I'm like
just need to get outside and find Ali's
parents in their car waiting for me you
know complaining like right away I asked
the first place and I was like is there
any trolleys that can get me from this
plane to outside and he just goes no and
I go I grab my carry-on suitcase and i
sprint like full-on and renting I had to
sprint downstairs like holding my
carry-on like I'm sprinting I get
outside and her parents like I get in
the car they drop me off and I'm like
you guys are amazing like we made it on
time I'm gonna get on this flight it's
gonna be great come on my boy was hurt
in the curated check-in line and she's
like we're good to go after she dropped
her my mom called me and goes I just
wanted to know like I want to live to
security just like you because I didn't
want her to get lost so I get through
security like really quickly there was
actually no line it was just me and this
other guy a night I make frantically to
getting all my stuff in it's like

off every night I don't know me like if
I good to go so I run through security
and I run to the airport and I find Ali
and we're good I've run through
terminals all day like that's the end of
that story if we get on the plane we get
to London it's a 10-hour flight like
we're fine we sleep on the plane a
little bit like we land and I'm like I'm
like so where's my luggage like like
what like what happened and like the
whole plan was up like Ali's mom in
South I was mom in Virgin Atlantic or
America I talked about like basically
they're gonna send my luggage on the
next flight but the thing was is we
couldn't ask them to send it on the next
flight until we landed
London so yeah so basically now here's
the current update we have past couple
out like it's so hard to saying how
couples we we've in the past 24 hours
you have had no clue where my luggages
we didn't know if it even made it from
LAX to San Francisco we didn't know if
it was insane Francisco at Virgin
America or rigid Atlantic we didn't know
who was on a plane to London to me we
didn't know where it was no one knew I
have to called I've been on the phone
pretty much this entire time we've been
in London I can go this trip without my
luggage I don't care but where is it
because like I know I need to know where
my things are that was a thing so as of
right now it is almost total o'clock we
gotta go get lunch
yeah breakfast it's almost 12 o'clock
and we just found out they have our
luggage in London which what we didn't
even know where it was until right now
they haven't let you take calls Monday
and we didn't even we thought it was
still in LA and they closed and they're
like yep it's here and it ready
deliberate Jarrah will tell for a pretty
hefty fee but we also found out when we
landed that our hotels an hour and a
half from the airport so we had to
overhear and it was way too much money
so I was like - over there and back it's
not only three hours but it's gonna cost
$200 so we're just gonna have it
delivered it's gonna be here this
afternoon I have to go get cash to pay
them on delivery it's gonna be fine but
yeah so let's enjoy London thank the
cert I'm sorry it was so drawn out but
like we thought it was really dramatic
and like we need a it and I need to
explain why I haven't logged anything up
until right now because I literally have
one vlog clip and it's like me being
like hang go on the airport is so
excited to me the alley and like
everything yeah and you're like thoughts
right there once it what can we do in
London yeah and then after that we were
just like no carb and so now we're gonna
