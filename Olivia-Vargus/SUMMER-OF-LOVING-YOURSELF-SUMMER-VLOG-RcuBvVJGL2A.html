my channel so if you're watching this I
just ended my vlog from yesterday and
this is the part two to that blog so we
just woke up and I put my bathing suit
on and we are going to go and get some
coffee and some breakfast and yeah
feeling good feeling alive it's kind of
I feel like a cool breeze through the
door right now but it looks really nice
out so I'm hoping that it will be a nice
like cool day relaxing day so we will
get ready and I so wasn't going to eat
anything but like it looks so good so I
just got some cinnamon twists because
they say that it's vegan and then I got
their iced coffee
with a splash of almond milk you guys
side not remember how I said I got my
dad a blueberry muffin from the place
called like plums
down by a stinky okay well time to eat
dot this morning
No I've already eaten a matcha blueberry
muffin
Simmons with two cups of coffee and I am
pretty much good today let this be a
lesson kids do not go to all vegan
restaurants if you're someone just like
me and has no self-control because you
will order everything on the menu and I
did
what are those no seriously what are
those two crocks she's wearing Crocs
Andals arrest her
alright guys just got to the pool and
I'm going to try out my friends mom
makes this all natural sunscreen I'm
going to try it out let you guys know if
I like it and I'll link it below with
ice too
Oh
so I admit the lighting right now not
too great I think the sun's like a bugs
me that's why but my mom and I are
walking down marginal way which is just
like basically the path along the ocean
and it'll are just really pretty sites
and like rocks and stuff and so I'm
trying to get them instead of there
right now and yeah we're going to walk
down so like this there's much of
restaurants and stuff at the end so
hopefully we can find something good not
super hungry because yesterday so much
I'm so full from hit so yeah
I hope you guys like that little
synthetic sequence that I threw together
I hope I like it too because I kind of
suck in cinematic sequences but I'm
hoping that it comes out good so my mom
and I just showered and we're going to
go walk down the road and see if we can
find some food
so cute we're really cute nice John
yes Sam it is indeed but and also
I think it over how cute the aesthetic
is here
yeah
oh my god it's live Wow
are you happy mom you want to talk to my
blog oh hello I just want to say Hyundai
night were two things one I am proud I
never had a single clutch five and we
know how hard that was for me to own
even however and - I want to be seen you
for such a great trip happen to me in my
into pic taking and my shopping and said
all my crazy shows thank you Anna would
you far away fro hot after you know the
landing was better over here on my mom's
side the whole time I'm sad all right
now we're going to walk down to a
chocolate shop which used to go to every
year and I looked it up and apparently
they have vegan options okay to try well
I probably shouldn't because I've been
eating so bad they can you watch part
one of these logs no but I'm not
stopping this is going to get any better
wait this is really cute yep I'll push
the plug the left now is Main Street
which is really cute love it here
getting the non various communities and
a little bit of the second one below it
is a caramel almond brittle forever but
I can't do that word beautiful I'm
surprised especially
I can't get any literally this is so
good it's the top ones like an almond
coffee toffee I don't know what I'm
saying anymore the bottom is like peanut
butter cookies and cream it's all vegan</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
