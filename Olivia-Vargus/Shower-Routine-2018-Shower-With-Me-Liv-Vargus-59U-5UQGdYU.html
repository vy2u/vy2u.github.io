my channel if you're new here my name is
Liv and today I'm gonna show you my
shower routine I really like shower
routine because I think that they're so
fascinating and not a lot of people
really do them but that's probably
because you kind of flood your apartment
so yeah that's me realizing that I was
getting a lot of water on the floor but
that's okay so let's jump right into it
so this is the shampoo that I'm using
right now and purple shampoo is really
good for people with blonde hair who
want to make it less orange and just
kind of more ashy but in fact I actually
scheduled a hair appointment for
Wednesday we might be changing things up
soon but you know to keep up with things
okay I feel bad for doing it also promo
there back to the video so just make
sure you know everyone knows how to push
shampoo in the hair like I don't really
need to explain that's you but I do want
to say that this shampoo is really good
I keep my hair clean for days on end I
really recommend it if you can find it
anywhere it's one of those brands that I
got into salon I don't know where else
you can really buy it but yeah after
we're done dramatically washing the
shampoo out of our hair we're gonna
conditioned surprise surprise so make
sure that you get all of the hair I mean
sorry make sure you get all the water
out of your hair and then I'm gonna use
the same conditioner from that same
brand this is violet so again it's good
for toning your hair and I pretty much
keep this in my hair for a long time for
as long as I can so I put the
conditioner mainly on the ends and then
oh this is also something I want to show
you this product is amazing I love the
dry bar products definitely check this
out look at how foamy it is it is so
good for in between washes moving on so
while the conditioners in your hair
we're gonna use some of this a fresh
cream from philosophy body wash and just
a sponge and we're gonna apply it on our
body as anyone else would just you know
scrub their body with we're gonna try
and keep this pretty minimum because you
know
keep this video pg-13 and then this is a
tool that I got from the body shop and
it basically just massages your body and
improves circulation so I just really
love using this I use this mainly on my
thighs but you know we wanted to keep
things pg-13 so we're just kind of
getting into our upper body this body
scrub oh my god this is my second
container of it I got it at Trader Joe's
and it's low-key very cheap look at how
happy I am like I love this stuff this
stuff mooster eise's your skin while
you're in the shower so you don't have
to apply lotion after the shower I if
you can find this please try it it's
amazing and it smells like lavender and
even if I use it in the morning it just
is so relaxing it's 10 out of 10 like a
lot of times oh I sorry I wasn't paying
attention but now we are washing the
conditioner out of our hair I'm you know
guys voiceovers are not easy okay moving
on we're gonna wash our face with your
glossier cleanser I go back and forth
using face products because I'm so
indecisive but I like how moisturizing
this is and it takes off you know your
makeup pretty well but the key is to
rinse your face with cold water after
you're done and then do the same to your
hair rinse it with cold water and this
just closes all of you know your pores
and then like I don't you tickles in
your hair I don't know this towel I got
for Christmas it's from Sephora it's
basically just a regular hair towel but
it's so amazing it fits my head
perfectly before this I was using like a
big regular body sized towel but I felt
like that was pulling my hair out so I
wanted to invest in something more
gentle love it then I'm gonna be using
this toner on my face right after the
shower to close my pores and this is
like the go-to for everyone I got the
Rose one and people love this I got it
off Amazon I've seen it in target before
too but just do circular motions to
really get into your pores and then I'm
gonna use this is my favorite
moisturizer right now this is my second
container of this - I got it at Sephora
and I'm just going to apply this to my
skin just to brighten it and I don't put
on moisturizer until later when I do my
makeup but this just kind of like glows
on my skin for a little bit and I like
to massage it into my skin
kind of like blood circulation as we
said before and then for my hair right
after I get out of the shower and I you
know put it up in that for a minute I
like to spray this stuff from dry bar
again dry bar is pulling it right now I
love their stuff this is this stuff
makes your hair so smooth it's but I
think that stuff that's called eight to
ten like this stuff makes your hair
smooth not tangled and it smells amazing
and it feels amazing and then I use a
wet brush and I comb through my hair and
that way I just make sure that it dries
without any knots in it because no thank
you
and then I put it back up in the towel
and I wait for it to towel dry until I
want to blow dry and style it and then
you know you gotta lay in bed after this
for like an hour on your phone but
that's it thanks for watching guys let
me so much and I was doing bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
