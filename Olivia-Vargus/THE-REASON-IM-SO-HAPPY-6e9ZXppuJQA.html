channel so today is the big day that
I've been waiting for and I'm so
thrilled so I have created my own line
of birch and the word merge is honestly
kind of annoying to me but I want to
think about it more as like I created my
little mini clothing line with another
company that is making it for me but
designs are all inspired by me and are
so personal this site it's officially
live right now so I'll have the link at
the top of description box you guys can
go and look at it I'm so excited to show
this to you guys this is probably one of
the coolest things I've ever done in my
life I wanted to film this just like
with the plain background so that I
could insert pictures as my talk today I
want to say it first a big thank you to
collab March for helping me make merch I
will have their information down below
if you are someone who wants to work
with them to reach out to them I highly
recommend them they're so so kind and
then I obviously want to give a big like
sappy thank you you guys for just
inspiring me daily and letting me be a
part of your life and being a part of my
life and my growth and just sharing so
much in love with me daily and allowing
me to share it back with you guys
everything that I designs I wanted to
make it so that it felt like you were
really with me while you were wearing it
I wanted to make sure that what I
designed also aligned with the messages
that I put on my channel which are about
empowerment and self-love and growth and
just positivity and I wanted the designs
to be bright until embody that as well
and to embody some of my favorite
sayings and things that you guys hear me
say so I want to give a quick disclaimer
though too that I actually don't own the
merch right now because what had
happened was I made the March designed
it ordered it got it in the mail and I
didn't love it and I just had to change
it I had to fix it I had to make it I
just needed to make it everything you
guys desert if I had the opportunity to
make it better I was going to take it so
I very very very last minute okay two
days ago ended up changing the entire
collection except for a couple of things
and I've reordered that and I should
have it pretty soon so now I'm gonna go
into each design and just give a brief
description on why I chose to make it
and if you don't want to see this part
and you don't really care about my
explanation that's okay you
just shot the safe below if you want to
but I really think that it's worth
sticking out to hear my explanation for
each of the designs and why I created
them so the first design is thrive and
this is my favorite in the collection
because you guys know thrive is my word
it's the most empowering word to me it
means to flourish it means to grow I
have one of the crew necks from this
site and it felt original drive design
and I showed it in my blog that I wore
and it's so comfortable I also put this
on a t-shirt and I ordered this t-shirt
in a size large that way I could wear
oversized I love wearing big t-shirts to
bed or out with like a jean jacket and
some sneakers and then there's also a
thrive film case with just the word
thrive on it the next design in the
collection is endlessly creating and
this is one of my favorite favorite
designs of this collection I ordered the
black crop top and I'm probably never
going to take it off like I'm Jenison to
work out in it wear it with black
leggings wear it with denim jeans wear
it every single day of my life I'm never
taking it off I'm actually wearing the
original version right now of the white
endlessly creating crop top and I had in
the yellow text but I changed it I like
this design so much better it's so much
more noticeable on the shirt the vision
behind this thing endlessly creating is
that I always talk about blowing up and
bettering yourself I feel like there's
this stigma behind when you become an
adult you just are who you are and you
stop growing and you stop trying to like
get better because you're just like well
you know I've learned everything I've
experienced everything so this is just
who I have known and so unless he
created basically just means to
endlessly be creating yourself and this
would be searching for new experiences
and I always want to keep an open mind
if this is something that I used to say
to myself every single day when I was
really young is to just keep an open
mind always because you never know what
experiences are out there it just has a
really special meaning to me and I hope
that you guys like that as well the next
design is the self love game design and
I use the font that is in a lot of my
videos and then I have on my youtube
banner because I just love it so I have
the phone case right now and I got a pop
socket that's black with a heart on it
and I think that's really cute so if any
of you want to twin with me you can as
far as the quality of the phone case it
doesn't raise up like that that much but
I have a glass screen protector on it
and I have a pop socket so I think I'll
be safe but I just want to give you a
warning that it's not like a super
protective phone case it's definitely
more for style so you know depending on
what kind of person you are just one
operation there's also a coffee mug
because as you know I love coffee I
drink one or two cups a day and then I
have it in a white t-shirt which I think
would look so good tucked in the pants I
originally didn't want to make a white
t-shirt I originally made this shirt
gray because I feel like white t-shirts
just tarnished so easily and you get
makeup on the corner of them but after
getting this one in the mail and looking
at the neckline of it it's stretchy and
I can get it over my makeup without it
like touching my face and I know that's
just sounds so ridiculous but after
realizing that I was like I'd rather
just have it in white because it looks
better tucked into my denim jeans then
the gray one did so the whole self-love
gained obviously it's pretty
self-explanatory love yourself and when
you wear these things or when you have
on you it's just a little reminder to
just you know value who you are in your
existence not for you beauty or your
outside appearance but just for your own
inner self so lastly we have one of my
okay these are all my favorite so I keep
saying one of my favorites but it is and
I started actual red hoodie and this is
like one of those mocks of the
antisocial Club like original brand and
the reason that Isis anti-semitic
trooper is because that's my Twitter
banner I talk about this all the time
this is like Who I am as a person cuz
I'm definitely an extrovert but I'm just
anti-social
and it's also a Kendrick Lamar lyric and
I made it in a ride because I didn't
want the collection to be all black and
white I wanted to have some color so I
made it in red and then I got a bunch of
dams asking for a white hoodie in my
merch so I asked them to add a white
hoodie to the collection with the red
font and you guys can order that and I
guess eyes large and wear it oversized
so like I wear all of my weight
sweatshirts oversized and again the
neckline on that is stretchable enough
to get it over your makeup if you order
in a size large I'm a thoughtful bitch
you guys okay I thought this collection
through so if you're able to get
anything from the collection let me know
tweet me pictures everything comment
down below what your favorite thing was
but if you aren't don't even worry about
it you guys I still love you regardless
I love you no matter what this is just
like a really cool opportunity like I
said probably one of the coolest things
I've done in my life is actually create
something tangible that you guys can now
own and have with you and I just feel
like it's just so it's mind-blowing and
it's so amazing and I just want anything
you to everyone involved in this again
into you guys this is just like a little
tiny part of my dream come true you guys
have given me the literal ability to
create
something tangible my life but obviously
I make videos every week but to actually
create something it's just so beyond me
and I'm just so thankful and you guys
inspire me constantly you inspired these
designs and I hope that you love them as
much as I do
and I'm just so excited so you guys rock
them with me okay guys make sure you go
and thrive today and every day because
you deserve to and I love you guys so
much I will see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
