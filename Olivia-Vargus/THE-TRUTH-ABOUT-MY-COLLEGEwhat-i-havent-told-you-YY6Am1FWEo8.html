this
after I edited it I wanted to add
something I wanted to say this video is
in no way to discourage any of you from
pursuing my college or pursuing living
your dreams and doing you know following
your heart and where you want to go you
can absolutely learn from my mistakes
make this experience your own there is a
lot of people that have gone my college
and done just a two-year program and
loved it and have been very successful
from it I just wanted to give you 100%
my honest open truth about my entire
college experience because it's just
something that's really prominent in my
life and it's something that I always
like and want to look word vomit about
on my vlogs and like oh my god okay I
can't stand this but I can't because
I've never been able to get the full
explanation and background story to
everything so this video is that thank
you for listening with it aligned and
like I said make your own choices but
learn from my mistakes okay love you
guys and fit them don't peep out of me
okay hey YouTube what is up and welcome
back to my channel if you're new here my
name is Liv I make new videos every
Monday and Friday it's a good time for
you subscribe and join our family oh
yeah and by the way I'm blonde now I was
born before but I'm much blonder now I'm
uploading a week in my life vlog on
Monday and you'll be able to see this
transformation in that vlog I promise
you guys you were getting a glow up in
2018 and I never break a promise today
I'm really making one of my most
requested videos and it's gonna be at
the truth about college I have avoided
this for so long for so many reasons one
of them being I'm really scared to dress
this on camera so with that being said I
know my college is probably watching
this it's a really small school and I
know all the people that work in the
social media department at vinum what
we're gonna be going over here today is
my experience thus far at my school I'll
give you a full intensive background at
the beginning and then I'm gonna be
going over my advice things I wish that
I knew I also really don't want to
discourage anyone or just be really
negative in a video but I think that at
this point it's more helpful to give you
guys the truth instead of pretending
like everything's great that way you can
take from
what you like - maybe it will help you
make some decisions on your own about
college and what I'm gonna do I'm just
here to be honest and authentic and give
you all the tools that you need to live
your best life so with that being said
let's get into the video so a little bit
of background on Mia so I am in my third
year at college and I go to fit um
we call it venom but it's dance for the
Fashion Institute is out of
merchandising also known as FIDM but if
you go to fit if you follow fit on um
I'm in my third year technically so
basically I got an associate's degree
which is a two-year degree in social
media and then after that and went on to
get my bachelor's degree in social media
so I'm in my first year of that
technically my third year so let's jump
right into my list of things that I want
to talk about number one BA the fact
that it's a two-year school system so
what I was looking for colleges I was
never a school person and I didn't want
to go to a four-year school and the
thing about fit um is that they do a
really good job at so they market to
students in high school that you can go
to their school and get a two-year
degree and after that you'll be ready to
go out into the world because you'll
have a missional degree on the
networking experience and that's just
not the case for anyone you really do
need to go to a four-year school it's
either you commit to 4 years of college
or you don't at all in all honesty my
program and for a lot of marketing
programs a 2-year degree is just not
enough it's not gonna be enough to get
you to highest paying jobs and for you
to be taken seriously amongst other
people who have the four-year degrees
from other institutions around thinking
about my degree social media is that
it's brand new so when I went into it we
didn't know what kind of experience that
I needed to have in it you don't really
know these days about social media when
you go to apply for a job like what
they're looking for on the resume you
know because it's brand new so you can't
really be like oh I have a two-year
degree in social media like we didn't
even know a lot of people don't even
know that social media is offered as a
degree and so when I was applying to
colleges that really pulled me in the 2
year program because I didn't want to go
to a four-year schools they market it as
if you know you can get in and get out
really quickly of this 2-year program
and you're ready to go I really think
it's unrealistic I think that they
should have pushed from the beginning
that two years is an option but four
years is recommended they didn't explain
that they just wanted your money now
you're spending more than the normal
college student gonna four-year school
because you messed up that was obviously
one of my biggest points and why I put
it first
the next thing that I want talking about
it is how
vitamins done in quarter systems so
basically it's a year out of school you
don't get some result like other people
and this is kind of okay if you're like
someone who's really ambitious and your
sign was working year round you work for
ten weeks and then you have two week
break in-between and then you just go
back into it you start a whole new set
of classes the thing about this there's
two main things about this that I have
an issue with one of them being right
off the bat you realize that when you
start school none of your breaks line up
with your friends or line up with anyone
else's so I would go on breaks when I
first started college and my friends
would already be back from their breaks
or they would be going on their breaks
when I'm coming back from mine the
second thing about the timing system is
that you feel really rushed and also on
week five you're already taking your
midterms okay so the next thing on my
list is student housing at school a lot
of colleges you get dorms some colleges
you live on-campus housing for fit them
but they do is they rent out apartments
around the area in downtown and they
basically put four people into a
two-bedroom so you each share a room
with someone else you can opt to get
your own bedroom but it's I don't know
many people that do that because then
you're paying so much money to still
share an apartment to other people you
just get your own room in it my issue
with student housing is so so deep
the thing about student housing that
really really really really sucks is
that they don't try to put you with
people that you would get along with
other colleges you have like roommate
questionnaires and you have quizzes and
they try and match with people in your
majors or people who sleep with the same
eight hours of you and just weird random
roommate stuff like that just make sure
that you're compatible with the people
that you're living with because you're
just living with them and they also you
don't typically let you know who your
mates are before you get to the school
not that I know they just kind of pick
random people three random people and
they put you with them and sometimes
like for my instance I did a story time
on this one that I don't think is on my
channel anymore I was placed with three
people who were already attending fit on
and weren't first quarter students like
I was so I had no friends because they
all had friends already and I was like
what I thought I was gonna make friends
on my first stay here and I didn't I
like cried for a week straight the thing
is is that I didn't even
know who my roommates were until I
walked into the dorm that day and I was
like hi I'm Olivia nice to meet you and
I was with my parents and then we had to
go and get all my bedding and stuff and
it's just a really messed up system fit
um if you're watching this this is the
biggest issue that your college had it's
really hot in here now so with that
being said a lot of people end up moving
out of student housing I do recommend
that you start school at student housing
if you're up from out of state that way
you can meet people and you can get to
know the area before you jump into a
year-long contract or lease within a
partner building and that's just in even
worse scenarios the next thing there's
no sports teams there is a club and they
call it creek life the campus is really
small and everyone's just isolated in
their own dorms your dorm rooms are
apartment building so you're living with
people that don't even go to the school
like it's not the typical college life
you don't get to meet people like the
people that you meet are the people that
you have classes with and even in that
scenario most people don't even talk to
each other unless you have group
projects together and it's still awkward
and hard to make friends and then
there's a few clubs but very few people
join those and I'm sure if you took the
initiative you could join them and you
could meet people but for the most part
it's just fun for yourself you either
have to get really really lucky with who
you get placed with in student housing
or really lucky with who you get placed
with in your class for your major for
party life there is none at all in fact
student housing was really strict with
their rules you couldn't have alcohol or
anything which no should I don't doubt
that at all but they would kick people
out left and right a lot of times you go
to surrounding colleges nearby like USC
and you can you go party there and
that's fine it's enough to get you
through the college experience that you
feel the need to have alright so the
next thing that we're gonna get into
finally has to do with education so my
major is brand new in fact I was the
first class to go through the classes
like I was the frontier the guinea pigs
if you must we were the first like
original 2000 G social media first class
in the nation to get a degree in social
media which is Jo but there was so many
problems so that was the associates
program though and over the course of
time
sure that they've fixed it and it's a
lot smoother now so now the bachelors
program I'll admit it's going a lot
smoother I know my directors out there
watching this going because I know that
he's worked pretty hard to get it this
way and they've listened to our
complaints I like my majors classes so
we call them ed classes the social media
classes I like them so far
they the teachers are significantly
better at teaching the last thing before
I get into advice that I want to give
you about finem is that you know I
didn't realize this I'm so dumb but if
it was like an all-girls school like
accidentally like obviously there's some
guys there most of them are gay and not
to be stereotypical because there is
some straight guys there there's
straight guys in my major I would say
it's like 1% is like a straight guy and
that's like fine but it's good in a way
that there's no distractions like you're
not distracted by guys or having
relationships or anything it's just
something to keep in mind if you're
going to college hoping to like meet the
love of your life can happen up at home
alright so with everything being said
thank you for listening to my complaints
and my angriness and all that stuff I'm
gonna give you some really really really
really important advice that I wish
someone had told me things that maybe
people are telling you and you're not
listening enough I need you to listen to
these facts number one being look into
the lifestyle of the students so for
example I have looked at the lifestyle
of said I'm student I would have
realized that they're working year-round
they do a lot of group projects they
typically don't go out and party or
anything but they typically have
part-time jobs a lot of them get
internships and a lot of them are really
really work oriented if you're not an
ambitious work oriented really really
like go-getter person then I would not
choose venom venom is for people who are
here to get their grind on and get out
quickly and so this has to do with like
where's the college located downtown LA
what kind of jobs to the people that go
to the college have what is their week
to be life look like so I suggest DME
people so find just like a normal person
who maybe is in your major isn't it and
just ask them what their life is like
like their week to week and that'll give
you a good example like what yours will
be like so the next tip regards
traveling
and if your college is long-distance so
it's something I never realized when I
started school because I was just
idiot when I started school love that I
just didn't realize how hard it was
gonna be the live long-distance when you
leave high school some of us are so
ambitious to get out of our hometowns
and that's awesome but after about a
year you know you don't really had that
same feeling anymore so look into how
easy it's gonna be to travel if you have
to travel in your college so unless
you're someone who can live at home and
go to your college you're gonna have to
be traveling can you park on your campus
can you have a car on your campus can
you drive home how far is the drive you
have to fly there how are you even going
to get to the airport when you're there
like can you reduce your town of lubbers
like if there's a lot to think about so
for example for me my travel days are
twelve hours it's a long day and it's
expensive too and if you're going home
twice a year or four times a year
between every break like it's a lot of
money so really consider that I know a
lot of you'll probably really ambitious
and you're like whatever I don't care
it's worth it but look into it can you
afford this is this reasonable it's just
going to drive you insane because a lot
of people move home after going to
college long distance for this exact
reason so think reasonably about that so
the next thing is how easy is it within
your college to switch majors or to
switch to another college and go
somewhere else I think with all that
being said this entire video being said
what I would have done differently if I
already do this all over again and
everything happens for a reason so I'm
not mad I'm fine I'm chilling I love
life it's good but if I were to be able
to do this all over again
I would have started school not a phenom
I would have gotten an associate's
degree somewhere else I think I would
have gotten a two-year degree the
associate's degree in marketing or
something in Boston saved a whole lot of
money and then transferred out to LA and
transferred to fit on because it's so
easy to transfer it in to fit them it's
impossible to transfer out of it so I
would have transferred in to fit up t at
my bachelor's degree in social media or
to do the professional designation
programs that they have which they
basically get you through a degree in
like a year and a half and then you're
out into the world I would have been
that it would have been a lot easier on
me financially and it would
a lot easier on me mentally a lot easier
only mentally well but everything
happens hurt them I feel like I got a
big weight off my chest
I've been wanting this video exposing my
entire college experience to LA now but
I was scared because like I said I don't
want to get in trouble with my college I
don't want any beef with my college so
demand I are good I love the director of
my program right now I am overall
satisfied with where I'm at this quarter
is going like okay it's we don't know
yet if you have any other questions
about things leave them down below and I
will try and answer the most frequently
asked ones but there's no problems just
that I'm gonna answer all of them
because I want to keep some stuff
private but I really hope that you guys
appreciated that's honesty and you liked
this video thank you for watching and
listening although in the end could get
excited about kind of long and be
excited from Monday I'm not letting a
whole week in my life and a lot happen
this week a lot happened this week it
was a very intensive week but I love you
guys so much have a great weekend talk
to you probably today on social media
come say hi to me anywhere and other
guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
