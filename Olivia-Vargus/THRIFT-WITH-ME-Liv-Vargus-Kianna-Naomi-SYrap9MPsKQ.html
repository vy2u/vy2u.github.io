my channel so I'm in the car again I
know my last video no it was morning
routine but I've been in the car a lot
lately and we all know how I feel about
driving vlogging I don't like it cuz I
get a lot of anxiety it's not we're fine
see this is exactly what I mean I
started vlogging for like two seconds
and now there's a biker and I'm just I
just don't like it get you're way too
far to the street man everything's fine
I'm kind of like I have like a sugar
high right now I just ate a really big
acai bowl and it just really it's how I
get distracted really easily on today's
edition of I don't know how to pronounce
anyone's last names I'm going to meet up
with Kiana and Naomi Naomi I'm so sorry
I don't know how to say it I don't know
how to say anyone's names or spell
anyone's names and it's just so sad but
we're gonna go thrifting and I'm so
excited a to meet her because she's a
queen and be it because we love a good
drifting at 13 vlog but yeah I'm so
excited meet her she's literally like
the sweetest cutest little human being
on earth we have a lot of fun and I'm
excited it's so beautiful out it's a
Saturday we all know Saturday's are my
cheat days I'm not really in like the
cheat day mood today so I might even not
really do much else but you know keep
you posted on that by the way my merch
is going to be released on Monday the
26th I believe don't hold me to it but I
think that's the day that we decided on
I'm just so excited to share it with you
guys it's like something like really
personal some people have been asking
about the pricing I don't control the
pricing because it's through like a
distributor and the distributor is
really awesome like I love working with
them I think the most expensive thing is
a sweatshirt which is about $40 and I
think that's reasonable you guys and but
it's still like 40 dollars there's a lot
of money like I'm not gonna lie to you
that I can get you four or maybe five a
Sables
okay what we're going
so this seems to be a theme in all of my
vlogs recently I don't know if it's me
but like I'm so bad I guess I giving
people like directions to where I'm
going cuz I accidentally I guess she
went to the wrong American Vintage
there's like a few of them
she's at the one Hollywood and I'm at
the one in Silver Lake so I did this in
my last vlog where meet Olivia Roy tried
to go to Trader Joe's together and we
both went to two different ones but in
like really similar locations so this is
the second time I've done something like
this but yeah I should see her soon but
it was really funny because we were both
standing outside of American vintage and
she's like let me know when you're here
and I was like I'm here let me know when
you're here and she was like I'm
standing outside and I was like I'm I'm
also standing outside and she faced I
mean she's like I'm standing outside
like where are you I was like I'm also
standing at home it was just we came to
this realization we were at two
different locations it also is so funny
because it literally just happened to me
with someone else
a week ago okay I'm a lot shorter than I
think I am okay so I just made you the
thrift store and I'm with ya okay we're
being probably so loud I dunno yeah
we're being really hot I just like to
know yeah I'm excited sorry there's so
much stuff from you guys so what do you
want to find today like do you have any
like like jeans sweat shirts tops you
throw a lot like sometimes I don't that
much yeah I would say jeans
that's like mom gamely so I can cut them
but then I cut them in to wear them so
maybe I should like I need to find some
new mom jeans because I got a little
sick this wonder and none of mine
I think the secret to stir up shopping
is that you can't look at everything as
like just food clothing but pretend
you're like in Urban Outfitters and like
that makes sense it probably doesn't
make any sense
but that's like how I go about it is
that like if I saw this in Urban
Outfitters I'd probably want it in your
on check I don't know because that's all
about those places fell like rabbit and
brandy like Brandis clothing it's like I
don't even know how they pull it off
half the time I buy things and like all
this is so cute I can't I can't wait to
wear it and they gave who I start
wearing it after like two wears like the
ugly thing out of her own this shirt is
a little smaller than I'd like it to be
but I like it
she's wearing a this is Led Zeppelin
you guys she lost her phone to white
being in the thrift store is that your
purse it's like my bag it's just my back
was it like over there different energy
but I found these men's business pants
that like yeah you know what they're
really well table just top I tie just to
get to the pan this would be like a good
like bleep shirt or you can actually
crop this these are men's pants and
these can be perfectly and the other
pair Amanda's men tend to so I know it's
fine your body is even better in person
but anyway they literally like look at
like that you can't see them for like
the length of them I don't know if that
was good or not length of them is a
literally perfect which is just funny to
me and like they come up right to my
waist like it's just funny you should
have done a while ago
like not even talk about my she's sweet
I tried on her own it looks so dumb
mo Chamberland right here she loved
colored glasses
she just got a lemonade which is so cute
rep Cubano cafe
