channel if you're new here my name is
Liv and I make new videos every Monday
and Friday it's a good time for you to
subscribe and join our family
I'm writing a topic that just it's just
down here so fun back
I actually think Valentine's Day is the
funnest holiday of the year even though
I've never once had a Valentine on
Valentine's Day so give this video a
thumbs up if you would be my Valentine
for Valentine's Day or if you just feel
bad and you want to give me a thumbs up
because I'm single forever but on the
real you guys I just love love and even
though I have been in a relationship on
valentine's day it doesn't mean that i'm
excluded from all the love my parents
every year would get me flowers and a
box of chocolate and a card so i always
just loved valentines day i'm gonna be
showing you guys some clothing that i
picked up and it's all really affordable
which is awesome this entire haul was
only like a hundred and ten dollars you
don't even need to get all of this you
can just get like one thing to wear on
Valentine's night but I got a lot
because I love Valentine's Day I love
the vibe of it I just love love I said
that a little bit if you wanted school
and you just want to wear something cute
or love themes then I have stuff for you
if you're like going on a hot date and
you need some thin line to wear I got
you or if you're going out with friends
anything I've covered all those
scenarios here so what a ways that I
went to and the reason I chose this
place is because it was in person in
store I didn't have time to order stuff
online is service only was the good
thing about everything being confirmed
21 is that first 101 has a lot of retail
locations in stores so you can actually
go out and get this before Valentine's
Day also side note here I'm gonna be on
my period on Valentine's Day that might
be TMI for some of you but I don't care
register that like this video if you
feel bad for me I'm gonna like my own
video because I feel bad for myself
disclaimer some of this stuff is like
lingerie and if this video gets
demonetized and the person who's
manually reviewing it right now is
trying to decide if she deserves to be
monetized on this video umm I mean
please take pity on me I'm a college
student and like I
Malone on Valentine's Day so you really
wanted to monetize this video like just
let me live my life you also parents if
you're watching yeah I just don't okay
so let's get right into it first and
then I want to show you it's so pretty
it's this white bra left and what I
really like about this is that it comes
down farther than like the actual bra so
I feel like this could actually be worn
like in LA we're we're so extra here
people would wear this as a top like
with some mom jeans they would do it and
then like a jacket with it yes that's it
look or you can wear this underneath a
mesh top or like with the jacket we're
just wearing underneath you regular
clothing and then you know it's got good
coverage which I like because a lot of
times this pad will be see-through and
this was $14 and I'm a size 34 I you
guys really know a lot about my mom so
this top I just thought was really
simple and cute it's just a rose and it
was only $10 I got it in size small it's
pretty much a crop top but it comes down
a little bit too long I might even cut
it myself but what I liked about this is
that it's so simple
I feel like obviously a rose like
romantic but I feel like I can see a
cute Instagram taking with this like a
nice little rose emoji this top is so so
cute this is a bodysuit so yes that's
what it looks like and this color is
just so pretty it's a blush pink and it
has an underwire I do wish that I had
padding in the like boobage area but
that's okay we're gonna work with what
we got
which isn't a law book for that and it's
also velvet so I feel like this is just
really pretty on camera and would be
really pretty in pictures again
I would wear this probably with a jacket
maybe like a white denim jacket or I
don't comment down below any other ideas
how you could wear this because
obviously like this could be a night
piece you feel but you can also
definitely play with this and make it a
tapie's and so this is a size small and
it was $19 this sweatshirt you have to
see what it looks like on so you can
understand it a little bit better but
this was really cute because I just
thought it was really simple and I'll
definitely get more wear out of this
after Valentine's Day too but again I
just have them
was like romantic you feel so this would
be a cute thing to wear if you're
hanging out with your friends or you
just showing up home a Valentine's Day
but I liked the feel of this the crop
was something I hadn't seen forever21 do
before it's like a cropped sweatshirt
but it still has a hem Dickstein dollars
and it's a size small and I'll probably
wear this so much and of course I keep
picking up things that are pink because
like obviously nonsense a pink love all
that kind of stuff this is a really cute
bralette and this has cups and padding
it's also in the color of blush and the
straps are adjustable I guess you would
call this material satin and the cups
have this cool like is thing oh I bet
you could hide food in there there's a
lot of room really a few Oreos oh my god
anyways more about this top I thought
that this would look so cute with either
black skinny jeans or even with like
some good mom jeans all I where's mom
jeans I need to stop but anyways I
thought that this could be really cute
to dress up or down or just do whatever
you want with it play with it
picture this with the rose and your
posing and you've gone to make a white
skirt or something and yeah you guys
hear that off-camera I need to move out
of downtown okay so low-key this is my
favorite thing that I got in this entire
haul and I'm gonna be wearing it the
 out of this so this is a giant
black denim dress with a zipper that
goes all the way down it and this is so
so flattering it makes you feel so
matched but it's still loose enough that
if you know you eat a little bit too
much and you have a little food baby
you're gonna be good you're safe I just
love how simple this is like I could
wear this with Air Force Ones and like a
t-shirt underneath it and it would be so
casual or I could wear this out on a
nice date with some black booties yeah I
this dress was only twenty dollars and I
got it in a size small and it feels like
really thick and like good quality if
you can find this F over 21 you need to
get this you can swim with me and the
last clothing thing that I got was
really really sweet and I saw my way out
and I went back and bought it it's this
blue and white striped it's just on top
with the front crossing detail tie
thingy I don't know it's really really
girly and I know you guys know me and
you know that's not like a really my
style but what I love about this is it
has little lavender things like flowers
on it and I've been thinking lately
about getting a tattoo of lavender oh my
god my grandma's gonna watch this and
she's gonna be so mad they'll ask me
that I picked up are these heart hoop
earrings and a little bummed that they
aren't gold because I only wear silver
but they didn't have them it's over and
I thought that these were so cute like
they're just hearts and I just couldn't
resist they were only there about four
dollars so alright you guys I hope you
liked this video if you did please give
me thumbs up and like I said in the
beginning thumbs this video up if you
want to be my Valentine because honestly
the family is probably the best
Valentine that I'll ever have no offense
huger husband that doesn't exist and
will never exist and I'm gonna be alone
forever it's fine I've already picked
out all the different breeds of dogs
that I want to get when I'm older and
I'm not mad about everything on when
you're longing you're single like you
saved so much money think of all the
food you just have to buy food for one
person this video was so cringed so
sorry about that I love you guys so much
happy Valentine's Day or soon to be
Valentine's Day I will see you guys
bitter buffalo
