looked on my channel before Wow
welcome to my channel everyone I just
got back from like a mile long walk so
I'm sweaty and no makeup I'm gross
please excuse there's a key on I down
there if you hear some wild boys is that
some Jonah but I want to show you guys I
wanted to show you guys why don't we put
this on even if it doesn't I work right
now like or use of all the noise ringing
in background but yeah but I just
thought these and I don't want anything
to know so I want to film this video
just critically you guys so I sent over
some shopping I got all my groceries for
the week and I got some new stuff this
week to try out but I got a lot of the
same stuff that I always get I'm gonna
show you guys what I got and I spent $60
on the road to eat all vegans and here's
my proof 61 bullet focus but I can see
that it shows
6105 as bad as their tents on each so
roughly $60 I try name 450 but I have to
buy like toothpaste and stuff this week
so okay so let's show you guys what I
got um so I picked up a box set it was
super cheap and I eat a lot of pasta but
I eat a lot of a spaghetti noodles I
wanted to
apply noodle to eat you know mix things
up get some different shapes of carbs in
there so God sees our soul bow ties I
thought these are my favorite vehicles
ever you guys the only ingredients in
them is organic sprouted whole wheat
berries unbleached wheat flour filtered
water sesame seeds barley malt sea salt
through to be and fresh cheese yeah no
bunch of stuff basically not that many
ingredients after though which is good
for people they're so good and their
flavor it's ready to eat that's meat eat
bagels I don't know I love them and
they're like they're here 20 holidays
one of these will fill me up so easily
I love taking the my go this main go
spread my groceries out are they talk
okay so then I picked up a bunch of
Japanese sweet potatoes because I
couldn't decide which potatoes to get
this week and I thought let's let's mix
things up let's get some Japanese eat
potatoes and these are 229 in pounds and
I got about one and a half pounds of
them so potatoes things like that are so
cheap like any carbs like the pasta the
bagels the potatoes they're all like two
dollars so that's gonna be like your
cheap things other things are gonna cost
my super foods a cheesy actually
purposely so next time pictures have
enough roads now because if I hadn't
been with already I'm in college and I
really don't have like a lot of times
between meals
so I picked up a lot of frozen meals
with me and I haven't been eating frozen
meals in a long time but I was a turkey
last week and I got a bunch mom's very
short I'm like addicted to frozen like a
nice evening meals right now so I think
sup this it's just a whole switch brands
and it's a panini oh I can't speak I
don't know what this is it's Ana pasta
you can see it go get it I'm gonna try
it I'll let you guys know in the
comments below later on when I try it if
I like it or not I got my swamp
toothpaste cruelty free organic yep but
my god I got these are my favorite
things to snack on there just like sugar
snappies and I already have a bunch of
them so I just picked up a few more but
they're so gonna be a snap bond and I
can like I I like to mindlessly eat so I
like to sit with my computer and like
mindlessly eat peas and carrots and like
not even realize it so it's better to
like eat stuff like this and like a bag
of tea no chips come just mindlessly
eating them and I think it's funny a lot
of people like to buy like the you know
they're like seeing like snap peas like
the ones and back so I cross them
advanced by Cocteau's Maki and it tastes
the same
but then I got some truth because we
just got the nutribullet and so I want
to make some smoothie so I got some
strawberries blueberries I would add
Vanaras but I'm allergic so I can't even
imagine I see it's sad I know that's got
one bag too I'm obsessed with French
bread right now you guys I
I don't know why I'm a weird face looks
like I want your own face dates recently
where I am indeed so many dates until
now I can't really Stanley because I
overdid it like everything else in life
so right now I'm doing out French bread
the other day this is kind of sad that a
side confession but the other day I ate
entire roll of french fries for lunch
and I was like I just had the French
fries like to read over lunch but yeah I
mean those were things right right just
then I thought I tried it so my own
peanut butters this was probably three
dollars for like a good amount and it's
just peanuts no saw I did it just
peanuts and it tastes so much better to
me than regular feed of I don't like
added sugars and salt like just
literally taste of million times better
selves try it out who ride it I hope
that's what I did
then I picked up I'm going through
another phase four digit chili so I got
a bunch of Amy's vegan black bean chili
and they literally have two servings per
container that each sevens only 200
calories I don't count calories I'm just
saying for like reference here and then
the each have 13 grams of protein per
serving and a lot of carbs too much
sodium which there was not much sodium
but honestly it's fine and I'm about to
start my period this week though so
we'll see how that works
oh whatever and I also got this flavor
it's just a medium with vegetables but
doesn't help it only has 7 grams of
protein which is professionals in it but
so if I got to the other ones then I got
oh I got some rice ready to put on top
of my eco bread also pulling this
we have Ezekiel bread I always have some
salmon but it alone but I recently
bought them and these two things gone on
top of it so good 30 breakfast lunch
dinner eat it anytime tonight
and then I picked up some more abusive
supplements I got the cheap really
really cheap brand because 150 of them
in here but they're like $2 for all
these from the brand new city by which
is just the whole foods around we took
these because I ran out today and then I
bought three more things and they're all
frozen meals like I said you know a lot
so I picked up they're all the evening
eating meals they all have a lot of
sodium
which I don't like but they fill me up
and they're can't see they're actually
really good check them out I had inside
beach bum yeah but I tried some last
week that were really good
I went to a video soon on but this is
the Thai red curry one and then this is
Amy's Indian vegetable hormone
and then this is the Indian palate and
