hey you guys what is up and welcome back
to my channel so this week I'm not at
home I'm actually on vacation I'm in in
San Diego I took a road trip with my
parents who came to visit me so I can't
do a regular grocery haul like I usually
do on Mondays I did actually get some
groceries so while I'm here and I'm
gonna show you what I got but I was like
why don't I do what I eat in the day
because a lot of requests is that and
it's always something that I've wanted
to do so I started to record that
yesterday but I'm on my period so what I
was eating yesterday literally made no
sense it's not a good representation of
what I eat in a day I'm gonna do a lot
more what I eat and a videos down the
line but for today I'm just gonna
combine what I eat in a day for my
period yesterday slash on a road trip
because I ate out for my second meal and
I only ate twice yesterday but my second
meal is so big that it's so high and
then I'm gonna show you the groceries
that I got to hold you over the next two
or three days while I'm here so the
first thing I ate yesterday was
something that I usually almost eat
every single morning and that's either a
Zico bread or one of those bagels that I
show you my grocery haul and I put my
peanut butter the grounded peanut butter
from Whole Foods on top of that I put
that on it and then I put on my jelly
and for some reason this week I bought
blueberry jelly and yes I know I'm very
jelly and peanut butter aren't the best
combination but it still tasted alright
but I recommend you try raspberry or
strawberry if you're trying to do that
and then I always put cheese on top this
is a great way to just get your omega-3
fatty acid and some extra protein in
there chia seeds you don't taste them if
you're a texture person try them out but
you might not like the texture of them
because it is kind of bizarre but I put
that in water bottles I put it in almost
everything I make just cuz I I can't
taste it and at first I didn't like the
texture but now I really like the
texture which is weird so yeah you
better try I also cut up an apple
yesterday morning and ate that with
breakfast as well because I needed to
eat them before they went bad and before
I left and so then I didn't really eat
for the rest of the day I
drink a lot of water I always have my
Camelback with me and I try and drink 64
ounces of water a day it's good to just
drink water when you're not eating it
helps you to digest better but why you
always obviously you know the benefits
of water and if you don't there's so
many great videos out there that can let
you know so we definitely roadtrip round
2 and I knew that we're going to stop
along the way to get food so I have this
app it's called happy cow you have to
get the app you can just look at it
online and it tells you all the vegan
places near you and you I map them and I
found one that was on the way and it was
this Chinese place and it was
advertising that it's low sodium a lot
of good vegan options and they cook the
vegetable oil so I figured it was the
healthier choice out of many things also
because it's low sodium
I always I'm always talking to the low
sodium especially on my period because I
hope that like a
I could literally be not be doing
anything like I'd just be sitting there
and breathing in my period will be like
oh honey here's some bloat for you and
I'm like oh no thank you like I'm good
right now I'm good
oh oh you want to look like you're in
your fourth trimester of pregnancy oh
here you go because you were gonna blow
so hard people are gonna let you first
on an airplane because they're gonna
think you're pregnant
that was off-topic but true anyways so
point in the matter being I blow a lot I
ate Chinese food it was so good I got
these vegan dumplings most I physic most
Chinese places will have some sort of
vegan dumplings and if not you can
always just get right there there's
white rice a lot of leases will have
vegan fried rice just get it without the
egg and yeah I ate half of it and then
waited another two hours in the car and
ate the rest of it and when I got to the
hotel it was like 7 o clock and I wasn't
hungry at all so that's what I eaten
today so that's why I don't want to make
this a whole video I'm gonna show you
guys also what I got for Croce's okay so
let me just show you guys quickly what I
got so I picked up okay first of all
definitely said I'm added in your
grocery store that's like super cheap so
I'm very happy about that my dad came
with me and he bought the groceries for
me thank you dad
so I don't remember how much it cost but
when I look at the screen it was like
thirty dollars for all this I got some
of these microwave potatoes because
we've a microwave
hotel I already had Chia seats that I
brought with me I got three sweet
potatoes
we'll see if I even clean no I'm gonna
be eating out for a couple things
because I'm on vacation but I wanted to
try and pick up with my things I said I
could avoid eating out I I also got some
oats so I can have these for breakfast
in the morning I also got some PB -
usually this stuff is very expensive but
it was so cheap here that I might
actually go back and pick up a couple
more before I head back to Los Angeles
let's see what else did I get
I got two packs of raspberries and the
water just dripped all over making I got
my ketchup secret potatoes and I get the
hunt ketchup but I get that 100% natural
it tastes the same as the regular brand
that most people get but the ingredients
are so much better so pick up this if
you are into ketchup as much as I am
I also because I love just snacking on
these I I got some dried apricots
because I was feeling it I don't know
why and then I thought I was crazy me so
hard I got dates loves me some dates
especially with the pits in them I think
there's so much better and someone told
me once to eat them with peanut butter
and I did and it came to my life so
shout out to you you were homie and I
hope you're doing well because you
deserve all the happiness in the world
forgetting that life hack okay you guys
so sorry this week's video for food
veganism is is a little bit bizarre but
um I hope it does still help you out or
inspire you in some way and that is it I
guess for this video make sure you
subscribe and thumbs up and I will see
you guys later
yeah bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
