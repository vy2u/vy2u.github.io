America in San Francisco and the reason
that there's no vlog footage like at all
from yesterday except for running
through the airport why you had to mean
is because you guys will not believe
what happened to us and what we went
through but we're gonna tell you the
story of how we almost were stuck in
London for the rest of our lives
basically so it started off in the
morning we woke up really early and we
had to get our luggage across the street
to get to the tubes and it was also
raining out that day of course of all
the days that were in London's raining
that day so we're carrying like five
luggage huge heavy bags across the
street because she started taking
dresses back to America yeah like
wedding like that was like a it was like
even like heavier than that I was like
I'm not a weak person like I'm a very
strong person internally and physically
but like that bag was the luggage was
full of wedding gowns and like I don't
know if anybody like knows how heavy a
wedding gown is but they're
heavy and there were at least like how
many were there like 20 wedding gowns
inside of it it was very bit like
everything like either of us could lift
and so we had to like be really careful
and like plan out our date with it so
and so we could obviously just got in
there like an uber to the airport but
like we said it was an hour and a half
away so really Kirsten epic tubes cuz
it's like cheap and we can do it and we
gave herself enough time forever and
that was the thing the night before
after was like enough time everyone was
like why you leaving for the airport so
early like you don't need to be there
gotta really acknowledge between the two
of us like something will go wrong so
we're leaving your hair we're like we do
believe we're gonna do something wrong
so we get across the street before we
get down to the tubes there's like
coffee places and we were like let's
grab a coffee and a bagel or somewhere
so we do that and as our doing that Ally
was just like this entire plan I
can't take this along the tubes it's
just I typed it and move the suitcase it
took me like five minutes to move the
suitcase five eight and also imagine us
walking ten minutes across the street
with our suitcases on cobblestone
streets with our suitcases in the rain
oh yeah and we had to go up hill on a
bridge that bridge that goes up I
slipped on the belly and we had to bring
our suitcases up a bridge look yeah also
it wasn't just to make it very clear it
wasn't just the lug
with the wedding dresses it was that
luggage plus my own luggage and like our
purses and our passports and everything
that we were just too much to handle
so Holly was like this like we're
hauling an uber to the airport let's go
outside and that's okay so we didn't
even have to cross the street we did
have to come over here look we could
have saved ourselves like an hour of
doing all of that we were like we can
just get in girls loving the airport and
gotten caught and called Murphy got
there for you yeah cotton coffee at the
airport and Paul knew her from the hotel
so oddly cause an uber and we're outside
were waiting in the burger shack and he
pulls up and he parked across the street
which was rude because I was like we'll
get across the street in the rain now
and then he's like basically I stood on
the sidewalk with all the luggage while
Ali was taking a luggage of cross like
one I took like the the big one first
like the wedding gowns
when I did that I like put the luggage I
gave it to him and he put it in the
trunk and I was just like I'm gonna put
my stuff in your car so that way I can
go help her grab her stuff and so I
throw my purse and my Starbucks and my
sweater in his in the backseat of his
car and then went to help live right
which makes complete sense to do that so
she comes back and she starts to like
grab my stuff across the street so now
we're both standing across the street
with him and he goes you left a colon or
through burn because we okay so because
we called an uber X he was like this is
a job for an uber x-l you need to cancel
this ride and call another uber so I'm
not taking you and we were like dude
like Kubrick Selleck if you have more
people yes but there's two of us why
would we call do breakfast all day yeah
we each have luggage but it's like we do
this all the time when we were at the
airport you just call it were like X it
doesn't really matter
and he basically and he had a minivan by
the way so he had plenty from Fargo we
could have said this week it was gonna
be fine and he was an asshole and was
like well like I'm not taking you so we
were like so annoyed with me go
I never went to a job we basically
didn't haze we basically didn't even
have time to like deal with this guy's
like like had attitude so we were
like what I've got talking over and I
wouldn't get early call him like an
asshole to his face like you're an
asshole we cancelled the uber to call
another one yes there a minute later
thank God because it was so fast yeah
last time when we called knew from that
location took like ten minutes so he
gets there fast we get into the uber and
we're driving and Ali realizes she
forgot her sweater and the other uber
and I literally was there I was very
upset really upset she was there I was
ordering I was literally on my phone
ordering it it was wondering sweater I
guys I love this water so much now that
okay like you're being ridiculous but a
 sweater but I'm all that matters
let me get home Ali like this day is
already started off so bad we've wasted
like an hour and two minutes later and
we're in the Oh BRR on our way to the
airport two minutes later and we're
probably about to get on the highway -
it was almost there Ali turns to me and
she goes oh my god the second she does
that the second she like has this like I
felt the energy I go
she knew what happened she didn't even
have to say anything are over or are
over our uber driver looked back at us
and we were both like my heart stops we
stopped breathing thought I was going
through I thought I was gonna throw up
we both instantly are like shaking we're
like like basically that Lieber goes
what it wasn't just the sweater that Ali
left in the uber it was her purse and
wouldn't hurt harder for it and her ID
in the other uber that is now who knows
where and we're sitting there in the new
over on the way to the airport without a
passport who else does this happen to
like so you can't just call an uber
driver back because like they have fake
numbers for the app so we're trying
though and like it's obviously not
working so we had to file a claim saying
we lost an item so meanwhile the new
goober driver pulls over and he's like
here we're gonna we're just gonna sit
here and wait and when you filed a claim
for lost item you don't know how fast
you're gonna get on so we could about to
have waited a whole day to get a
response we
no we've never had this happen before so
thank God okay so when I show them how
they do it you want to put it in but can
I show them how you do it how it calls
them yeah because I want like if anybody
else were to have this problem like I'd
want them to know so like if you're in
the Ober app okay and then you go to you
go to your trips and then so here you're
on your trips why can't you see that
yeah let's just click like this one then
you scroll all the way down and you
click I lost an item and it'll take you
how do you click it click on that it'll
take you to this page and you say
contact driver about a lost item and you
scroll them to the bottom and at the
bottom you can put in your phone number
and when you put in your phone number it
automatically calls you like just like a
random number calls you and you pick it
up and you go click one or two or
something to talk to your over driver
and it'll literally call your last super
driver which is really nice which is how
we did this so we call him and he was
like oh yeah like I see her stuff I'm
gonna meet you back at the spot that we
lost like picked up meanwhile like this
took about 10 minutes I think to figure
out like how to meet him yeah her to
even get in contact with him so for a
while we were panicking like we were
basically just like the only thing we
can do is just like trust and stay calm
anything okay honey I didn't cry by the
way we yeah nobody stayed strong well we
were like freaking out we get back we
drive back to where we met the uber
drivers we sit there for like five or
ten minutes and we wait and we're
looking at every driver of the cars that
passed by because out him is on him
he comes back around we can't her stuff
we get in the car we get we get all the
way to the airport but like you guys
don't understand how bad that was for us
because we would have been stuck in
London you can't get another pass or I
would have like shipped live back and
stayed I really have had no choice but
to go back yeah I myself and then I
would have been stuck in London and my
mom was like okay my mom like looked at
me and she you want to put this in there
mom looked at me and she goes she goes
okay let's think of it listening this
through like worst case scenario if you
hadn't been able to get your bag back
like it's gone it's completely gotten
like what what do you do and I don't
know like I go um I probably would have
liked best case scenario stayed there
for about a week extra her waited for
you to have like all that in
America they bailed out if they would
have had to flown out to me cuz like
 I don't know the whole thing was
almost like a crisis disaster
catastrophe and Memaw so we tried we
wanted to leave for the airport at 8:00
so we ended up not even leaving for the
airport until 10:00 so yes we did have
to have that cushion of right right is
over yard and we hadn't like given
ourselves
extra time in the morning to like be
super cautious we would have been stuck
in London we ordered soup in there right
now so I made it yeah and then the
entire flight home was like ten hours I
was awake the entire time she felt up a
little bit but like I just watched
movies we landed and then like we went
outside your house her parents and I
were in San Francisco and I'm gonna
start a new vlog so I'm gonna say
goodbye to you guys we're gonna be in
San Francisco for like 24 hours I'll be
back in LA tomorrow and I'll like you
just watch that book so anyways thank
