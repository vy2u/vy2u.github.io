hey what is up and welcome back to my
channel if you're new here my name is
Lib I make new videos every Monday and
Friday it's a good time feel free to
subscribe
enter notifications on and join our
family I am so excited to be vlogging a
weekend in my life because I feel like
whenever I vlog it's always during my
stressful school week and so I'm so
excited now you guys get to see like
kind of the fun or more relaxed side of
me every Saturday I go hiking with my
roommate and it is literally the best
part of my week when I look forward to
this all week long I didn't bring my
volunteer because I didn't want it to
overheat but we just did it's it kind of
like it's like a 30 minute hike it's
really not that intense but it's just
fun and it's relaxing and it's a good
like break from the city because you get
to be in nature for a little bit and
then afterwards we always get a sigh a
balls my favorite food in the world is
putting peanut butter in an a say a bowl
it's heaven like if you've never
experienced it it's heaven what we
usually like to do in the afternoons on
Saturdays is we like to plan kind of
like a fun day whether that be like
shopping or just going to the beach or
just doing something as out of the
ordinary that's what we like doing
knives there wasn't really into the
party life anymore we did that been
there done that and now we're just more
into the like work mode all the time so
Saturday's would like to tend to take to
relax and go to a new restaurant to do
trendy things that we hadn't had a
chance to do or would have been wanting
to do oh yeah we go to earth it's the
arts district and dt4 good photo walls
and it's just really common nice out
there so we go there
one of these days I'll make a video
about how to train your friends to take
good photos of you because I took
photography lessons for years so like
now I kind of I know how to take good
photos on their people but I feel under
satisfied with how everyone else takes
photos with me and I know that it's a
common struggle that people have like
when their friends can't take good
photos of them I just find it to be one
of those small things in life but it
couldn't hurt to expand your knowledge
on how to take photos of other people so
this is kind of like the box out of the
Arts District just so you guys can see
it's really pretty they have this bridge
up and you can like walk on it I don't
know what it's for but it's definitely
new it's never there but there's like
shops here too but for the most part the
Arts District is just known for like
having really fun artsy like graffiti
and just art installations and just
creative stuff pen nose highlight is
popping I love this shirt
they're usually it's just like pretty
dead here and there's just like art
walls and there's a couple bunch of
fashion bloggers taking pictures but
today there's a locomotion fair and
loco-motion means like bikes and
scooters and like skateboards so there's
some reason there's like like take a
look around they can just like a bunch
of like random things or like fights and
it's like so awkward cuz worthy worthy
only bloggers here today taking pics and
like we don't care like we're in the
middle of all of it like we're not
invited to this at all we're just using
these walls so the things you gotta do
this is the behind the scenes of an
Instagram photo like you're kind of like
a part of this like it looks like we're
like part of this group of people if
you're out in public and you see girls
or boys or anyone just taking pictures I
don't ever think that it's okay to make
fun of them or laugh at them like oh my
god like I mean I've never listened to
it like I never care like there was just
a couple guys in a car that were like
laughing at us all we're taking pics I'm
like I couldn't give less of a TVH
and you guys shouldn't either like that
I tweeted this you know that I don't put
your validation in the hands of other
people because that gives away your
power who validated by yourself don't
let it be by strangers that you don't
know or by friends or family or
boyfriends or people that you're
interested in like literally let your
confidence come from within like you
will never be that's like the key to
being unbothered in life is I don't care
about other people I don't know now I'm
gonna change because I'm extra and I
just hop is a little itchy and I wanted
to be like so comfortable when we gonna
eat so I bought soft hands and we're
gonna change and just have hands this is
so much better this is so much more me I
have on the champions butt so I called
in my last video and then the boohoo Tom
and I also for my last video this Alvin
all together was so cheap and I'm
wearing Nike Air Force Ones with it and
it's like the most comfortable like best
outfit because it looks put together and
it's so comfortable and now it is
finally time I'm so excited we're gonna
go and get the food that I've been
looking do not hit us
this is that I've been looking forward
to from month so I think it's funny time
to reveal to you guys where we decided
to eat so excited they just run all my
first fake tada these are vegan garlic
knots so this is the place in downtown I
was originally gonna get penis but for
some reason I just sounded better dance
it out no no I'll show you that when I
get it but I'm so much better
you look at this beautiful creation it's
a vegan calzone with Guardian chicken
and little sides of vegan ranch I'm
about to literally die
I'm not kidding when I say I ate like
all of that so basically what you saw
was the cows oh and begin with guardian
chicken in it but I didn't like the
chicken so I just dumped all the chicken
out so there was a mountain of stuff on
my plate so I basically just ate the
outer bread shell with like the tomato
sauce and cheese on it
and it was really good in a moment but
now I feel like mother nature is
beautiful no but like dead eyes like I
feel so sick right now
I want to address something later in the
vlog about food because some of you
might be like clip we thought you knew
preps in like eight to twelve hundred
calories a day but we don't have a talk
we don't have to talk about that later
but for the moment okay oh you guys know
Cody cow he's his comedian he's I'm
talking to someone
he's his comedian and he's like he
always makes snapchat stories or he's
like oh my god you guys this sunset
right now is so beautiful I wish you
could see it and he's like making a joke
because he's just showing it like
himself
if you drive this car while I'm leaning
on it right now Kiana I swear to God
to the big ones that says that they
happen every night in their constant
thing that you can rely on every day so
if you have anxiety or depression I
recommend you start getting addicted to
watching the sunset every night because
it will truly I'm going to get
copyrighted you turn your music down
because it will truly change your sense
of purpose in life and just give you
something to look forward to every day
hey Bros keepings for waiting for me
all establishes that's really pretty
today to remind you let's take a look
like that's beautiful downtown looks
really pretty from a distance just like
me downtown's ugly but from a distance
it's kind of cute yeah just the epitome
of me it but we were driving and as I
just told you I'm so full and Keanu
stopped like really short and I was like
what if I just like throw up when you
stopped because it was so abrupt that
looks cool
it looks like downtown's bigger than it
actually is comment down below what your
favorite city is I'm from Boston and I
also have been to New York before I Love
New York but there's a lot of cities
I've never been to so comment down below
what your favorites are because maybe I
might just be looking for some travel
recommendations Shawn and I made a
pit-stop to forget 7:00 to go to Target
and
because we wanted to go to the Nordstrom
Rock I like how not even like five
seconds ago I said how hungry I was that
I want to throw up and then I went and
bought these it really doesn't even come
with much inside I'm so disappointed you
guys on a shorter state that like don't
think Olivia's fat or anything cuz on a
normal basis she wouldn't eat any of
these types of foods yeah because it's
all you film today's you eating like
yeah look at the sun's at the we're
gonna have a talk about calories leader
in the blog and we are we're gonna talk
about like normally she wouldn't do this
oh yeah no just on Saturdays
I know yeah that's a lot today I wonder
why I'm drinking water yeah that's a big
thing I didn't took a lot of water today
so I was like more attempted to eat a
lot I brought this big water bottle with
me oh really that's okay
straw the grove is our Christmas like
it's literally still November but
they've had this up for a while and this
honestly is like this is what keeps me
going in December when I'm homesick is
the fact that like LA really pulls all
out for Christmas decorations oh so does
it bother anyone else like this is the
Kylie poster but he has no earrings in
and you can literally see
the holes in your ears I don't know that
kind of just bothers me what she's
looking snatched she looks amazing
oh yeah okay so I'm gonna hear
us little half scoop it all the way to
top top and I got some new jeans that
one here but I'm so sorry this is such a
vibe very satisfied with this choice
this Saturday night choice 7:40 we
wanted pop coordinates on behind but we
couldn't get in so much when you're in
the movie theater like it's good you
want my horn it smells so good so we
just don't funny but I didn't know that
it was a seagull so like we sat down the
number the movie number two's daddy was
the called Sonny so daddy's home too and
I was like people were going to the
girlf single really it really gets you
because there was so many cute couples
and everyone was on dates even the
people next to me in the day I movie
theater were like cuddling the whole
time and I just sat there like why but
then also I was walking with Kiana after
we left Nike to the car and there was
this really hot guy standing that this
bitch is just like what the bitch
will be walking back to the elevators
and there's this guy on a date with this
girl or whatever and they're like
waiting in line for something but I
swear to you he looks too dead at me and
I like did I looked away because like
I'm respectful like girl that's your man
I'm respectful but then I was like let
me look back one more time and I look
back and he was still looking at me so
girl I know it doesn't sound possible to
get a scrunchie stuck in your hair but I
got a scrunchie stuck in my hair and I
swear to God I really can't get it out
this is Kenzie's March and I think it's
so cute I love merge with meaning
because I just did it so much better
than putting your name on a shirt and so
I would love to have murchison day I
actually had like a whole I don't want
to make it merge
I just what I think I was for my own
clothing line I have this whole concept
let me know in the comments below how
you feel about me possibly coming out
with like something like that in the
future so Flo somedays self-care Sundays
whatever you want to call it I love
doing Sundays to relax and I love just
spending time alone
I actually made plans with my
that I haven't seen in a while for later
tonight and so we're gonna meet up for
lunch and typically I don't like to
leave my apartment on Sundays because I
just want to stay home and like
literally rest but I think that I'm
gonna go run some errands I'm thinking
about doing an Instagram live today like
while I clean my room
maybe but I'm also like really nervous
your Instagram like because it's live
but if I don't do one comment if you
want me to do some in the future I know
you guys probably do but okay here's the
thing about Instagram lives I don't even
watch other people's Instagram lives
because I get uncomfortable so I don't
know how to start my own Instagram I
without being uncomfortable let's figure
out my outfit in hair and I think I'm
gonna clean my room and then leave my
room gets messy like within the span of
two days like it literally takes no time
to get messy that's all like clean
laundry that I need to put a wire but
then like oh my god I literally get the
worst OCD about this stuff look how much
better that is I'm so happy with myself
for getting that out of the way for the
day
so my outfit right now is the new jeans
that I got last night from Topshop with
my Air Force Ones this bag is from
Topshop my sunglasses are from Free
People and this top is an old American
Apparel top but they obviously don't
make them anymore because American
Apparel went out of business and then my
scrunchie is the fluffy scrunchie that I
hauled from Free People
so at Starbucks I was hoping to get like
to tear something that wouldn't give me
a lot of caffeine because I always get
so addicted when I get one Starbucks
coffee caffeine that they use is like
extra powerful so it's like addicting
but I end up getting a plain bagel and
then on the side I got the Justine's
peanut butter because I'm just so hungry
right and I just really wanted something
and it sounded good and I was like it's
self-love Sunday let's love ourselves
and get something that we want
um not to be annoying but this is
probably about to be the best decision
I've ever made in my entire life if I
can get it out with one hand I can't
hold on
you guys it is so beautiful and peaceful
and quiet out Nellie today I'm literally
so shipped because yesterday it was so
crazy busy and you know what it is it's
because it's the weekend before
Thanksgiving anytime it's near a holiday
in LA
it is so dead in LA because no one in LA
is from LA it's very rare
so everyone leaves and goes somewhere
outside they go back home basically so
it always gets so quiet and I like
completely forgot that was a thing I'm
so satisfied because it's beautiful out
my windows are down like I'm just I'm
enjoying life to the fullest right now I
get the worst things I do in parallel
parking and I'm literally so proud of
myself for doing that right now I'm like
three blocks from Free People so I'm
gonna have to walk in the heat with my
pants like in my hands because I didn't
bring a bag and return the things but it
was so hard to find parking and like I'm
literally shaking because I hate
parallel parking so much it gives me
like the worst anxiety and if you don't
practice it regularly it's very easy
forget how to do it I just got to Whole
Foods and I haven't even gotten on my
car yet and there's there's so many
attractive couples here are you walking
around and I'm I'm just really single
mood lately I mean is it even a motors
just me it's just a lifestyle but also I
spent like ten minutes trying to find
parking spots and I probably flipped off
like three or four people and now I'm
gonna go inside this Whole Foods and
probably just face all those people that
I just slipped off while parking and
that's so awkward because like I don't
have road rage but like I don't know I
hate like I don't know how to say this
all being like really angry on camera my
friend bailed on me and I was so excited
to see her and I was so excited to just
have a fun day on Melrose and we had
talked about going to the Trading Post
and like going Urth Caffe with that
being said and I'm home now anytime you
gotta go with the flow keep a positive
attitude and just keep chugging on I'm
wearing this new Nike shirt that I got
at the Nordstrom Rack yesterday and I'm
just gonna go and do upper arms and I
workout this weekend I felt like I
didn't really like um the way my body
felt after eating this weekend's I'm not
insecure and that sounds like I'm not
like oh like I regret it all but I know
that I feel a lot better when I eat
plant-based instead of eating processed
foods you're eating out and eating oily
like drunk food I just
rather eat plant-based junk food you
know so I think I'm gonna start doing
that from now on one more plant-based
restaurants for my cheat meal days cuz
that way my body just like bounces back
better like it just feels healthier
internally so I just took my pre-workout
I'm amped up I'm gonna go run for about
10 minutes lift some weights for about
10 minutes run for another 10 minutes
and then I'm gonna come back upstairs
and do the rest of my workout for about
an hour so it's usually an hour and a
half of a workout make sure you turn
your notifications on to find out when I
post next and let me know if you want
more vlogs for me I love vlogging I'm
sorry that this vlog wasn't as
interesting as I wanted it to be but I
hope that it was so fun thank you so
