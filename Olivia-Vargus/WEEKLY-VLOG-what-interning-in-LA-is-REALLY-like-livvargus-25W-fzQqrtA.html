with Monday and I'm on my way to my
internship that I have for my college
classes I'm required to take an academic
internship so I have one all the way in
Hollywood on Sunset Boulevard at like
9:00 I can mix it then keep it stresses
me out every time the yells directions
at this internship is somehow an hour
away even though it's only eight miles
away welcome to Los Angeles
this morning they asked me to pull up
out front so that I can run errands for
them probably just errands like going to
the post office to drop things off and
then I'm really hoping that they want me
to go to Starbucks for them because I
think I need more coffee I already had
some but I really really really think I
need more if you don't know how to
fashion PR companies basically they take
on clients and brands that are in the
fashion industry so accessories even
some athletic where they basically just
try and help the brand's get more
publicity like the easiest way to
explain it so they do that they're
gifting stylists they give celebrities
they give to influencers they get
publications do a lot of trend watching
it's a lot of stuff I've done fashions
or internships before and I like to say
to them that's why I chose to do another
one and I wanted to try out like a
different brand and see if like the
perspective of the different clients
would change like how is the industry
work I don't think this is what I want
to do for my long-term career but it's
something that I can do while I'm in
school and balance with everything else
so that's why I chose it
okay so I did Nick as my internship on
time it's 8:50 so I've come in spare so
yes okay so I just gotta have my
internship it took exactly six o'clock
right now I'm so tired it was kind of
long day but it through it Monday let's
get it okay and now I'm gonna go home
hopefully the drive isn't an hour long
but usually it is stay at home and then
when I get home I'm gonna try it and
hopefully have the energy to run just
work out basically so while I'm clearly
stuck in traffic I feel like this is
good reference for people who don't
understand why downtown LA is so far
that's it look way out there where is
where I'm coming from is like ten miles
away if that makes sense so downtown is
so isolated from the rest of LA and
that's why I have an issue with it what
did they do to their car oh my god
okay so I just got in and I got this
package so I'm unboxing Olivia hope you
love all your new biddies can't wait to
hear you thank xx Bel Air oh my god this
is so amazing they send me so much stuff
oh alright
starters hoodie Thank You Blair that was
so sweet of you I can't wait like where
everything and like try it all out oh my
god love you guys thank you so I put
this on my Instagram story today but my
closet broke so I had to take everything
out and put it on the ground you can see
like it literally came off the hooks so
this is what I'm dealing with right now
it's a pain in my ass so it's like 9
p.m. now and I told myself wander at the
gym today and I got really really tired
after I came home obviously like I was
literally up so early
working in Sussex famine and driving
home in traffic so everybody didn't
think I had the energy but then I
remembered that everyone has the same 24
hours in the day as each other so
someone else can do it why can't you do
it I would remind camera but the gym is
always really busy at night because I'm
not the only one who works out at
nighttime obviously
I look super dead this morning so today
is the day that I usually stay home all
day and I do with my online homework I
have two online classes it takes me like
three hours per class which is like the
imagine you would spend in a classroom
anyways so it's fair and like I get to
do it from homes like it's fine and you
don't have to socialize so you love that
I have gotten better online classes I
used to hate them so much I think it
depends the class that you take like
Nevers you come a class online I have an
economics class and then a business
management class online now that it's
May and you make a new playlist but I
really can't stop listening to this song
by the same person
and then this song and they're both by
the same person they're so good as name
is Aries are you like that this is my
favorite snack right now I'm in the
middle of doing homework and these are
just they're so good it's honestly a lot
later in the day now a lot of times
Tuesdays are my days that I catch up on
things and I had two things that I need
to edit and send back to me that I
finish and I had a few emails to respond
to which I finished that too
still a lot of work my online classes to
do but right now I'm gonna go grab a
package from downstairs that I'm really
excited about okay so what this is
obviously the brand that I ordered from
I really don't know how I feel about the
fit of these they feel really snug on my
hamstrings focus my hamstrings I guess
but but then up top they're like too big
right here I still love them though like
I'll still get a lot of wear out of them
okay so our favorite me and I and my
building just came by and like he's
literally in our apartment like once a
month because our apartment breaks like
once a month
and I heard you beat yourself horrible
luck so he said he's gonna come back
tomorrow morning and fix it I showed him
the closet and I just said they're like
yep
bitch way okay so it
a p.m. and I just finally finished my
last exam for the day online so what now
I'm gonna try and rest for a bit and
work out in like an hour maybe good
morning Wednesday so I just woke up and
it's honestly kind of late it's open so
it's already United o'clock and I just
woke up I'm gonna make us some coffee so
I have homework for today's class at
3:30 that I haven't done yet I have to
write like a press release which is like
easy for me to do my apartment is such a
mess like there's no space in our
kitchen and I'll show you what I mean
so the way that our kitchen is set up is
we only have two cabinets and then we
have these down here and then there's no
other cabinet space like obviously that
cleaning supplies and the trash is there
dishwasher we actually turned our
utility closet into a pantry with this
shell from Ikea so I have the top two my
roommate has the bottom two and we also
have like my luggage and like a vacuum
in here like not I'm not sure I can play
that ungrateful because I've obviously
I'm grateful for this kitchen but we
just don't have any space which is why
all my stuff is on this table like
there's an insane amount of stuff on
this table it's so bad I always feel
like I'm moving in a month but I just
realized I've every move in 22 days 23
days my new kitchen has so much more
space and this one does by the way I'm
obviously doing moving vlogs and I'm
obviously gonna do like a brand new
roommate tag in an empty apartment tour
and like all that fun stuff because I
live it I literally all my friends from
home and like other people who are
getting out of school this week but me
they literally all just finish their
finals and they're free for the summer I
mean while some ways meanwhile I still
have two months left in midterms this
week I don't end up to a June 16th I
think so my outfit to class is literally
just a sweatshirt that I stole from a
friend a long time ago the leggings and
Air Force Ones I have horrible period
cramps right now like so bad so I don't
want to put anything on I have 30
minutes into a class and they found out
that we're all out of printer paper so
now I have to go to what we call the
annex and print a bunch of
you know my my period when this is what
I just went and bought from Whole Foods
honestly if you think about it they're
just disgusting but I like love them so
much I've never tried this brand before
but these are not only vegan but they
are like a plant-based kind of like halo
top type thing where it's only 80
calories per serving so you can eat like
the whole pint and not feel guilty about
it
which is what I'm probably gonna do I'm
supposed to be doing my homework right
now and I've been watching vegan muck
things on YouTube for like an hour and I
just love watching people sit and eat
like a ton of food like my friends
dude used to have this fetish too and I
was always like what's wrong with you
and now like I think it's like a fetish
that I'm developing like I just love
watching people like eat absurd amounts
of like fried vegan food like this girl
has like mac and cheese and he's Diaz
it's like this girl is eating like all
this food and like there's mac and
cheese and a grilled cheese and I'm just
like I want it so bad
 periods I'm actually so about to go
to class I have to go print my Simon's I
really want to pass out and I'm pissed
off for like no reason but at everything
last night my roommate went to my
favorite restaurant without invited me
and ever since then I've been
questioning our budget yeah can I go
look at Meghan so I came home from class
and I got another package and I can't
figure out how to open it so I've
actually never heard of this brand
before which makes me feel kind of bad
but it looks like it's called a Vitara
that's a lip mask and I think they have
like a bunch so oh I love rose-scented
things that look so Clube so good hey
guys so I didn't feel much a lot
yesterday at all because I was clearly
having like a rough day with my period
but today I'm feeling so much better
my room is finally cleaned because they
came and fix my closet thank God that
was getting it so so bad
hey guys so I meant to take my camera
downstairs just me and I left my flash
cards here but I went downstairs and
took Instagram photos with my roommate
and I'll probably post that now so if
you see this jacket on my feet that was
the photo editor stick downstairs I got
upstairs and I had a package from
two-faced and they always tend to face
Oh weights and packages with all this
pink stuff saw my
my heart just stopped beating it just
right now are you kidding me right now
wait is this what I think it is this
isn't happening I don't need all these
shades obviously so I'm gonna try and
like give away these shades people who
need them so maybe on my Instagram I'll
do like this giveaway and just like ship
them out one by one to people I'm so
excited thank you to fees ok so I woke
up this morning and terror like
literally 10 minutes after cops was like
hey girl do you want to go to go on a
walk on Manhattan Beach and I was like
kind of far it's like 30 minutes away
but I was like you know what I have like
a lot things to do today but I was like
I I'm so sick of overthinking and being
at home I was like I would love nothing
more than to just like you get to burn
go yeah and then go walk and you guys
have I'm a coast person I love the beach
I love the ocean so I'm so grateful
thank you for inviting me of course and
it's so beautiful out today it's like 80
degrees out I'm wearing this top from
brandy melville that I got on though
that I just hauled I'm also wearing this
belt that I had at Coachella so I feel
like I'm gonna be at Coachella so it's
um princess Polly Topshop shorts and
then I'm wearing sneakers but doesn't
really matter about the beach these
glasses are from keep the lighting isn't
like great on my face right now this is
also everything to me right now because
I've been so homesick and haven't really
really really missed Cape Cod and just
this atmosphere so being here is like
therapy this feels just like Florida
right here if you've ever been to
Clearwater Beach it reminds me a lot of
that
there's a literal be on my phone it's on
my phone
really really really really cute dog
okay but so I just thought home and I
know I look really rough right now but I
got a package and it's a really special
package
so this groaning boy on Instagram I'm
pretty sure he wasn't ripe I'm really
sorry if I didn't she has a jewelry
company called the wrap wrist and she
deems me and she's like I really want to
send you a new cosmic necklace so I was
like oh my god that's so sweet
I really need like I cannot find cosmic
necklaces anywhere that are in sterling
silver that I like and so she sent me a
package and I didn't know she was gonna
send me all this stuff that she put in
it but I need to like give her like the
biggest thank you I feel like so
grateful that she was willing to not
only send me a brand new cosmic necklace
that I'm gonna be wearing every
day of my life for the rest of my life
but she also sent me other things that
she knew it has meaning to me like this
love stone necklace which is unreal like
I'm it's so perfect and like dainty and
she said it has to do with my self love
gang because she knows I'm all about
love and positivity and then she sent me
a necklaces thrive on it that she
stamped and I'm like this is
unbelievable I'm wearing all of this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
