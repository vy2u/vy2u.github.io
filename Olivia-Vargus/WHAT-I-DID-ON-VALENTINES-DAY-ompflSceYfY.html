laughing hey YouTube what is up and
welcome back to my channel if you're new
here my name is Liv I make new videos
every Monday I'm so sick of saying that
oh my god so oh my god this is okay okay
so okay well I suck at this
okay guys so today I'm gonna be filming
a vlog a day my life it's Valentine's
Day so it's a pretty interesting day for
me you know I got all these plans
just kidding I'm literally alone today
I've always loved Valentine's Day let's
get that very clear but for some reason
this year I woke up I was just in my
feels all morning I was like you know
what bitch you know what no this is not
what we're gonna do today we're gonna
have a good day today because you know
what the choice is in my hand
I can choose to have a good day you you
feel it doesn't just happen to you you
go out and you make actions and plans
you go out and you make it happen you
know let's get going and I'll explain a
little bit more in a second what we're
gonna be doing I don't have any date or
anything today but I ran into a friend
and not hallway who has had a date and
he got stood up and we were talking for
a while and he was like he spent like a
hundred dollars on stuff for this girl
in his day and he literally got stood up
so you know I'm complaining a lot about
my like today but it was really
comforting to talk to him and realize
that it could be much worse so we
actually have a fun Valentine's Day
playlist put together for this but in
fact I didn't want to put together a
playlist because I already had one put
together because actually you know fun
fact I'm single the rest of the year too
not just today and I'm pretty depressed
about it every other day anyways and
it's called men are evil and you know
there's a lot of good bops on this
playlist some of you might be wondering
you know live you haven't posted a drive
with me video in a while why not um it's
because I'm just not good at driving
driving it only gives me a lot of
anxiety and I just don't really like to
do it on camera
yeah well Brian definitely takes the
crown of people who can write bitter
love songs I love her I love anyone with
the name Olivia I feel it we all really
get it she likes everyone and I was so
caught up in my job didn't see what's
going on
obviously notice if you like the way you
look that much oh baby you should go and
love yourself you're welcome for that by
the way I know that put you in your
fields that's all puts everyone in their
fields
so this next song it has a little bit of
profanity in it please excuse me if you
don't like this kind of stuff but this I
need to get out of my system
so so bad
I told you like what did I tell you I
told you it was a good song I just
needed to get that out of my system
because not that I'm particularly angry
at anyone today I'm like I don't know no
let's get back to some like more loving
positive vibes maybe it's time to tell
you where we're going what we're doing
so you know you can have Valentine's Day
without like food of some sort and I
low-key ran out of groceries so I need
to go to Trader Joe's ah we're fine
and then I also I really need to go to
Target I really need to get q-tips I
didn't even want to say that on camera
because it's like too real but you know
what damn it you guys I'm a real human I
also really really really need to get
like my hands on some good acne curing
miracle-working something you can't tell
because you know your girl she caked her
face and I should do an updated get
ready with me how to cover your acne
with makeup video because I'm pretty
good at it but if you really look
closely you can see how bad it is right
now and it's like I drink so much water
I eat it so clean I'm a nice person I
don't know why I have acne at all I
would say recommend stuff to me but at
this point you guys I don't think that I
think I need a see a dermatologist would
you do other fun things today too you
know we have so much time and room for
activities because like I said I have no
plans today I do need to get a smog test
I need to fill out my taxes really badly
I need to do financial loan exit
counseling so that I can register for
classes next quarter but when it seems
all that urgent or important you know
like who needs a registered vehicle
here's why going to Trader Joe's and
Target are like the millennial version
of crack because it's always even to
talk about it's because it's retail
therapy in the form of things that are
necessities so you still get to go and
buy things and spend money but you're
enjoying it and it's on things that you
need like toilet paper and acne creams
how would you guys feel please don't hit
my car please look literally don't okay
how would you guys feel about me making
work okay so I might be making marriage
statement so is there much coming out
most likely yeah but I don't know when
or how soon and I'm really particular
and I'm really specific and I make
everything that I want to wear so I
really want to make March with meaning
and I have so many good ideas
I made it look like I knew the words to
that but I was reading this Spotify like
a lyric generator I always forget how
crowded la is and how most of us are
single and just let Morgan holics so I
can guarantee this is gonna be like a
singles parade in here today maybe I'll
find a Bay in here you know what gosh
that I don't like that word it's just
not me okay so I admit it's a target and
I'm actually very hungry right now
maybe I'll go to Starbucks and get you
no no we're not gonna do that that I've
spent so much money on eyes on milk
lattes in the past one is just stupid
so sorry the lighting is not good I got
these two things and then I got somebody
washing hands so now I'm gonna go I'm
actually I don't like don't have much of
an appetite right now but like feel
definitely as though it's in my destiny
to still eat some things or what
hopefully fine food at Trader Joe's and
then really funny I ran into the other
Olivia you know I still don't know how
to say her last name but Roy I don't
know I love her though but we were here
each other and we both have this same
day plan to go to Trader Joe's and
Target so we're just gonna need each
other Cheetos and grocery shopping
either so it's fun
so I just go to Trader Joe's and I
almost got hit by like ten different
cars in this parking lot which is unreal
because you just don't expect to get hit
in a parking lot that often but I like I
can't even tell you like how crazy that
just was for me also I realized that
there's two Trader Joe's in Hollywood
and Olivia are gonna meet each other to
your Joe's and I never asked her which
one she was going to so now I'm not one
of them and I texted her but she's
driving and I need to find out which one
she's going to before I get out and
start shopping I feel so dumb so I went
to the wrong um
Trader Joe's she went to a completely
different one and we both like circle
around the store for each other for
hours I'm so dumb it was my fault
anyways I got some flowers and they
small I also really have to pee and
every time I have to pee when I'm in
West Hollywood I just go to the Grove
like I get a ticket I go all the way up
the parking garage it takes like ten
minutes I park and then I go and I pee
and then I leave and there's nothing
else that I do that it's fine I hate
driving in the backwards direction
forwards backwards is not fun oh wait I
made it to Whole Foods I got my sushi I
got to the Grove I went downstairs I use
the bathroom I came back upstairs and
now I'm so hungry I'm ready to eat so
are Whole Foods I got the vegan spicy
mix a veggie wrong it honestly they
don't have one of like this you guys
know I have an avocado allergy so I'm
gonna have to take the avocado out of
all of this so we're gonna do a little
my thing and I'm gonna give complete
credit to where credit's due
Emma Chamberlain you guys know I love
her like I love that ho she doesn't know
I exist she doesn't know who I am I
comment on every single one of her
videos just cuz I love her and she ate a
burrito in one of her recent videos and
she was made at a mukbang with a Q&amp;amp;A and
I'm just doing that too I mean it's not
like she trademarked
things or eating in a car but just you
guys know if you haven't seen her to it
she's much funnier than me and you
should go watch him
honestly it's like really hot in here
and I'm not gonna turn my car on because
I'm running out of gas the gas it's been
on for a while now and I was like haha I
got priorities I got other things to do
than go get gas so I'm just kind of
gonna have to deal with the fact that
it's ten thousand degrees in my core
right now I'm fully you guys ask so
many questions
oh my god you guys to ask questions
really quickly I didn't expect that best
rom-com I hate movies but I love the
movie Kung Fu Panda and I don't use much
romance in that would you ever marry
anyone that isn't vegan like I want to
say no because I want to raise my kids
like being ethical but I just don't know
I think it's just really circumstantial
like if they're willing to be vegetarian
or if they're just not assholes about it
I think that it would just be
circumstantial only saying that cuz
grayson dolan is not vegan and i just
like i don't want to turn him down ever
so what's your dream Valentine's Day
date I have always wanted to go on like
a sunset like take out date like eating
I don't know acai bowls or Cinna holic
or something like at Griffith Park or
just overlooking like a really pretty
area in Los Angeles just like
overlooking like somewhere why the Sun
setting in LA and also eating food and
just like talking and listen to music
that's my dream date honestly what do
you give your friends around today I
love just sending the memes you guys
what are you eating on Valentine's Day
oh and you know that once in space him
how do you know if your crush likes you
well first of all your queen he probably
does I mean if you want to make the
first I don't really I don't have good
dating advice how do you say motivated
to eat healthy on holidays I like create
healthy food so I'm always wanting
healthy food I occasionally obviously
want like junk food but I like to enjoy
the moment of life at all times so if
I'm gonna eat something that's gonna
ruin my moment because it's like gonna
make me feel disgusting that I'm not
gonna eat it so but there are some
occasions where I'm just like
everything you know
I'm getting a lot of anxiety with my
camera I'm flashing if my camera dies
just know that I love you guys I have to
literally go through and take the
avocado out of each of these two
everyone's saying we'd be my Valentine
of course the family is hands-down my
Valentine this year probably the best
best Valentine perhaps because you guys
are so loving and this like little
community is so adorable and so
beautiful so I'm honored to be every
single one of your Ballantine's before
my camera dies I also got these because
someone who is vegan recently just
showed them and they're the hail-mary
chocolate almond butter cups and I think
these are gonna be really good I hope
you guys had fun today in my little vlog
and we not much happen but I enjoyed
just kind of candidly talking with you
guys not sitting in my bedroom because I
know I've been singing on Twitter a lot
but I'm just still ready to move out of
my apartment and like I'm just counting
down the days till it's done because I'm
such a sensitive person with my
environment and living in downtown like
in the city it's just not me it's just
not who I was like where I'm meant to be
like I don't think I could ever live in
any city like maybe Boston because I
look like Boston's so much low-key
energy if you've been to Boston you feel
and the quest Hollywood is beautiful I
love it out here it's so much more quiet
and it's just peaceful and like it's
still crowded and that sucks
it takes a lot on your mental state but
it's definitely where I'm moving to next
or like even North Hollywood where like
Runyon is because you guys know I love
it up there but yeah I'm just also I'm
just I've been in this lease for two
years and I've just lived in downtown
for three years I'm just so so so ready
to be somewhere more me in a more
natural setting yeah I just want to give
a little rant as to why I just like it
felt like I wanted to get out of my
apartment I just don't feel good in my
apartment right now so any opportunity I
have to leave it and I also do so much
from my apartment like I film videos my
Bahrani welcome work at my apartment I
study in my apartment everything I
literally feel so apartment locked so
getting out just driving places like
it's just the best feeling just I don't
know if you know you know so okay I
can't wait I Tommy was eating but I just
want to say bye guys love you so much
happy Valentine's Day and thank you for
