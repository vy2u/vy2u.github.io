channel if you're new here my name is
Liv I make new videos every Monday and
Friday and feel free to subscribe and
join our family today I'm gonna be
showing you a grocery haul I am a
college student I love to shop on a
budget always I typically like to try
and aim for 50 dollars a week I'm just
feeding myself so I don't know if you
live in like a family right now or you
have to feed more person or you share
groceries with your roommates but this
is my rule of thumb there's actually a
lot of really great videos on YouTube
that will show you how to eat on like an
even tighter budget but I'm going to
show you everything that I got for a
week I buy vegan I try and buy
plant-based and I try buy groceries that
I can meal prep and make ahead in
advance for myself if you want to see
meal prepping video give it a thumbs up
I've made a lot of what I eat in a day
videos but the reason I'm making this is
because now you can kind of see like a
wider scope of the groceries that I get
instead of just like what I'm eating in
one day and I hope that this can just
kind of give you guys some ideas some
healthy like alternatives okay so I
unpack my groceries in order of like
meals so I'm gonna start off with snacks
and when I got for a week of staff so
the first thing I'm gonna show you is
this amazing hummus this is eggplant
hummus I sound like such a nerd geeking
out over hummus on the internet but I'm
not ashamed because this stuff is so
nice it doesn't have any oil in it but
it's made with eggplant and chickpeas
and I usually get two of these I only
got one because I know how quickly I eat
them so I thought if I got one I would
savor it more and eat it slower it's
probably not gonna happen like I will
eat this in two days and then I got a
big bag of green beans to eat with it I
think that green beans taste pretty good
compared to like carrots I don't like
carrots
I don't snap that much I'm more the kind
of person that eats a really big meal
and then will drink water in between
meals to stay full but for the most part
if I am craving a snack like for example
I bought this because I tend to stay up
really late at night doing homework and
I want something to eat that's not gonna
make me look go to bed with a full
stomach like really sick feeling but
will still like give me energy to get
through the homework so that's why I got
these two things also before I go
further into these grow
trees I want to talk about plant-based
for a second because there's a
difference between being vegan and being
like a raw vegan and so basically raw
vegans just eat Rob so it's like they
don't even cook their foods it's an
extreme lifestyle and I don't think I
will ever be a raw vegan like will never
say a number but I don't see it in a
card for me I like being plant base for
the most part because I feel super good
about myself and my digestive system
when I do eat like Whole Foods I did go
into this grocery shopping trip with
more of a raw mindset because I watched
this podcast where the lady was like
basically look at your food and describe
it and whatever you use for adjectives
to describe your food is what you become
because you know the saying you are what
you eat so don't you want to eat things
that are vibrant and full of life and
full of like nutrients and that you
would describe with those adjectives so
that's what I kind of try to keep in
mind I think I did an okay job but I I
know there's a lot of room for
improvement it's sorry for that little
rant let's continue the other snack that
I got is some raspberries because these
are my favorite fruit and it's not even
berry season name anymore it's
definitely apple season and it's
obviously fall like we all know this but
berries have a low sugar count and so
they're really good snacks for people
that want more fiber and fruit but don't
want to have like a lot of sugar so next
I picked up more cherries in the frozen
section for my overnight oats because
this is my favorite overnight oats
recipe putting this with my autumn up
this is an unsweetened vanilla flavor
this is the flavor that I always get I
don't like that Trader Joe's doesn't
have that many options for non-dairy
milk I prefer to get the whole foods
flax milk that you've seen because it
has eight grams of protein and it tastes
so good and I like the Khalif of farms
on the milk but because I didn't feel
like having to go out of my way to go to
another grocery store I was like I'm
just gonna get what Trader Joe's has
which is this and it's not a bad it's
just not like super organic see there's
a lot of ingredients I like to just buy
things that have like a small ingredient
list so moving on to lunch I have been
loving making sweet potato wraps and
I've been putting them all over my
Instagram
and stop trot stories because I just
think that they're really pretty and
they just look like really healthy so I
feel like I have my life together kind
of but they're really easy to make it
takes probably seven minutes to make
everything because it takes like 45
minutes to microwave the potatoes so I
got a bag of sweet potatoes five sweet
potato soup tails are really cheap these
are a medium size they're like as big as
my head I don't know they're kind of
like the perfect size for one serving so
I will microwave these and I put them on
a rack I picked up the illegal bread
wraps tortillas I don't know what we
call these these are awesome because
they have six grams of protein per
serving add eagle bread is just a better
for you girl it's a better like mixture
of grains because it's I don't know it's
just better but it has a lot more
protein it has a lentil in it they also
had a new rice tortilla which had three
grams of protein and it had 30 less
calories and I was thinking like what do
you really even matter like 30 more
calories for three more grams of protein
like that isn't that so much better so
always look don't look at the calorie
count on dates look at the actual
nutrition count in the ingredients and
that's what I do and I buy groceries
then I got some romaine lettuce things
to put in the wraps some people are
gonna comment and be like oh you can
make those no carb or whatever by like
getting rid of the tortillas and making
it with lettuce wraps okay people that
like lettuce wraps are just lying to
themselves like please enjoy your life
honey but they sounded good so I got
some tomatoes to cut in half and also
put in the wraps and then my favorite
thing that I got and I've been getting
these a lot lately is the dr. Prager as
California veggie burgers I've been
getting these at Whole Foods and like
I'm just obsessed with them they taste
so good and they're so easy to make and
they have really good ingredients
usually veggie burgers have a lot of oil
and salt in them but these are pretty
simple like you can do better but this
is probably the best that I have found
on a budget so far then I also picked up
two containers of the cauliflower curry
salad because it's just ready to go it's
easy I thought that this also could be
good on a wrap when I say that I don't
have time I could just throw a bag of
this with like the tomatoes and the
lettuce and it will taste good and have
like an okay amount of protein picking a
running-mate I also picked up their
vegan lentil soup that I saw this just
looked really good it's high
sodium but it got pretty good protein in
it so I thought that it would be worth
it I also picked up some bananas which
I'm gonna wait till they get a little
bit more Brown to eat them cuz I hate
them like this but I'm gonna eat bananas
in a smoothie with PB to powder and my
vegan protein powder and I'm gonna have
that like after workouts from now on
because I find that my workouts or we've
got more intense and more about my
muscle growth rather than cardio and
like weight loss so I'm now trying to
like gain more muscles to be eat more
protein so I'm thinking something like
that and then I got some cauliflower
rice to make with my curry sauce and my
broccoli that I already own and that
will be kind of like my dinner I usually
eat like really big lunches so thinners
are usually my smallest meal of the day
because I eat them pretty late so lastly
I want to give you some tips on when you
go grocery shopping how to know what to
buy especially if you're vegan or if
you're just like really new to the idea
of buying groceries for yourself this is
my best tips so number one don't look at
the calories look at the ingredients
when you look at the ingredients you
eventually train your brain to know like
when I'm reading the ingredients on
something I can tell already what the
actual nutrition label is going to say
because if I read the word oil or
peanuts or coconut then I know that I
have a high fat count but if I read that
it has a lot of lentils or a lot of lead
that I know I can kind of already
calculate in my head what the rest of
the nutrition is gonna be as far as
terms of carbs and proteins so there's
three main important things that you
want to look at on a nutrition label is
protein count carbohydrate count and fat
count when i have an imbalance then
that's when I usually get headaches and
when I usually feel sluggish so it's
really important to pay attention to
like if I eat the same thing throughout
the day for like three days tomorrow how
did I feel those three days how did I
feel after I was done with those three
days were those meals sufficient enough
to get me give me the power that I need
it
the next thing to pay attention to is
sodium count because a lot of times
foods will add a lot of sodium to make
things taste good and that's also what
makes the food addicting so definitely
pay attention to the sodium count I
would give yourself a 300 mg I don't
know that stands for like limit and if
it's above that per serving I would
hats on it just cuz it's not gonna be
worth it it's gonna make you feel more
bloated and retain more water the next
thing you want to be attention to it
sugar because a lot of times brands will
sneak sugar into things to make it taste
good for example on the milk I always
buy it unsweetened because it tastes
literally the same you don't need the
extra sugar next when in doubt buy
frozen because the amount times have had
to throw out old fruit and vegetables
and even bread or potatoes or like
anything that is so frustrating to me
and it's just such a waste of money so
always try and buy more frozen foods I
usually always buy a lot today I only
got a couple things frozen then you can
just heat it up in the microwave for
like two minutes in like a thing of
water and it's so easy also when you go
grocery shopping I like to start in the
produce section that way I kind of fill
up my car on produce these guys start
and like the frozen section or in the
snack section that I'm gonna see a bunch
of things and fill my cart up with that
but if I'm shopping in the produce
section first I'll get a bunch of things
like the tomatoes and the lettuce and
then I'll go to the other sections and I
can add the fillers you get more food
per calorie when you eat plant-based
then when you eat like processed foods
which is why I highly recommend a
plant-based diet it's also really great
to always have a good list of foods that
you know you want to buy before growth
growing grocery shopping like watch a
bunch of videos like you are now and
make a list of things that make sense to
you that you know that you can
realistically eat give this video a
thumbs up if you want to see more of an
in-depth how to grocery shop video today
I mainly wanted to show you what I got
but I would love to do a video where I
maybe take you on a blog along with me
it would be kind of awkward of love in
public grocery shopping but I'll do it
for you guys if you really want it
because I don't mind comment down below
if you have any favorites from Trader
Joe's or anywhere else that you think
that I should try out and comment any
tips down below that you want to also if
you find them helpful make sure you
subscribe give me a thumbs up if you did
