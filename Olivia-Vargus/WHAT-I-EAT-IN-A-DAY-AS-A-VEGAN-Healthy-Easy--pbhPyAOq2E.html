channel my name is Liv and today's video
is going to be a what I'm eating in a
video all this is going to be vegan and
healthy and pretty much really cheap and
easy to make that is key because your
girl is a lazy vegan right now I'm
eating to get set to get lean I work out
this is what I ate this week basically
every day I've had it meal prep and so I
was really excited to buy the HT guys
feed recipes because I'm so stuffed up
they're so good so I really hope that
you enjoy them if you like them and you
recreate them let me know you can tweet
them at me pop them in your Instagram
give this video a thumbs up if you do
like it and make sure to subscribe to
see more from me if you like one of them
eating Indian videos let me up so you
should do them a lot and then I kind of
stopped but Here I am again because
they're fun and I like sharing my
swimsuit including the link food alright
so now I'm just going to walk you
through everything from morning until
night pretty simple to explain let's get
to it every morning as you've seen in
all of my videos I had the donut shop
black coffee and then I have a liter of
water and then for breakfast and you'll
prep some oatmeal over I oath best thing
ever and it's even funnier when you do
prep it in like mason jars because
they're cuter so I've meal prep
basically regular serving of oatmeal
from Trader Joe's with their unsweetened
vanilla on the mouth I write unsweetened
cuz it still tastes good and there's no
added sugar so it's like woodland and
then I add these frozen dark sweet
cherries from Trader Joe's that are so
good in oatmeal if you've never had it
in don't little for it's my favorite
oatmeal topping and it is so little
morning so I add about three of them and
I'm pretty lazy so sometimes they just
literally plop them into the oatmeal but
if you want to like actually make this
like recipe maybe try cutting them up
and putting them into the oatmeal and
you know you can add so many different
things you can add chia seeds hemp seeds
you can add protein powders I just
easily like this because I'm so boring
I'm so plantable and I think this tastes
so good and this is how I like it it
makes me feel good I don't really need
to add anything then it looks like I
have an hour leader of water gotta stay
hydrated folks usually only about thirty
minutes after I eat drink another liter
of water because I don't want to mix
high water with my soups and I will
so load it and don't want that stem for
lunch you guys this week I'm Sophie to
share this with you so I did this is the
first time ever I'm meal prep so
basically in red lentils brown rice and
shredded carrots
and just one serving of each and I meal
preps basically four servings from each
of their packets and I made about four
new hub containers but on the first day
I ate a focus here of it and it was so
full and filling but basically it was so
filling the first day that I ate it that
I was like next from next day I'm just
going to eat half of it and see how that
makes me feel nothing I did and so here
I am eating half of the serving of rice
and lentils and carrots you can make
these in the oven and discuss them for
like 20 to 40 minutes but I'll just look
like I'm just gonna put this on the
stove and I heat it up and add stuff to
it so that is what I did I add some
rosemary and some black pepper like
always and then you guys if you have
never had telcel before don't be afraid
of executing everyone scared of like
salads and kale salad is kind of a more
intimidating green but you need to try
this out because it's so so good like
I've been eating it okay every day like
way too much for like weeks now
I'm so excited shout out to do so
basically by a giant bag of kale my to
dye packs of kale who cares and then get
like your fat-free balsamic vinaigrette
I don't know why I feel like buying a
factory is like better but it's probably
like equally is like okay is like
regular dressings it doesn't matter but
I get fat great and I got a computer
Jose you can also get it like whole
Tomatoes really good one so I'm like
there's 365 grams and I basically add
this into the kale salad kinda quilts
while it's gets in my fridge now add
more when I go to eat it because it's
Kelsey stove on its own like I'm not
gonna lie when you have this dressing
and then you guys the key ingredient is
blueberries have you ever thought of a
blueberries in masala for I bet not but
now you will and if you feel really
frisky feel free to add like some
walnuts does the staff show nuts
whatever you want I did not do that but
I wish I did someone make about it so
basically I was together
I kind of stand there and eat it while I
wait for my food to cook and then I add
it to the food and then surprisingly
like the balsamic vinaigrette with the
rice and lentil like mix tastes so good
so that is definitely a Tennessee lunch
makes you so energized and furniture to
steel you to give you what you need to
be a boss lady through the day go then
Oh lately I've been having cold brew in
the afternoons for like a little
pick-me-up and it's definitely
definitely starting to affect my Brandon
like getting addicted to it and I need
to have it every day so I keep when that
happens with coffee thing and then it
looks like at the time about 3:00 in the
afternoon I would to Starbucks and I
just picked up a granola bar because I
had a Starbucks gift card and I was like
I need to be to eat so I went to the
register on this is kind of weird books
I just kisses granola bar like I already
have your coffee and I got this and I
thought if I wanted her all of our
because I hadn't had any like sources
really like good fats in my diet for
today like my oatmeal has probably four
grams of fat weird I know that but I was
like I need to like or not like bar and
I don't like eating granola bars I my
figs I like even though I'm addicted to
them but they're not like they're just
so sugary and like not like even
sustainable like they're so small and
it'll give me like the full feelings but
they do give me an energy kick if I need
it so that's what I did long story short
then for dinner this is such a classic
live glue I fill a bowl with peas and
then I fill the bowl water and then I
put it into my microwave for two minutes
depending on your microwave strain you
might need you less than that
two minutes and then I drained the water
and then today I was the other half of
that concoction mix that we have already
established is really good from earlier
and then I was like I want to add sauce
in signal what and this is the first day
and then admit this is the first time
that I did this and it worked out so
well so I'm so excited but I remembered
that I bought this Thai green curry
sauce from Trader Joe's and I was like
wow how did I forget that I bought this
so I added it on probably not even
cooking I just like took it included on
top and mixed it in and look cry right
now
I could actually cry because AI love
food so much nd it was just so good it
was so good
it's a little bit spicy it's like lime
spice I don't want to flame curry if
you've never had it I recommend trying
it it's not super expensive to buy this
and if you don't like it then it's like
lightly $3 but please like green here's
some rice and lentils and carrots and
Thai green curry sauce but you are doing
great it's great life is good and then
to any day around 9 p.m. 9 30 ish I've
been having like decaffeinated green tea
with a cinnamon stick in it and this
just helps me feel like calm and soothe
by the other day I should call my
stomach down hose my diet dress feel
hydrated before I go to bed and you
still want this comforting and just me
like me some kind of tired so that is it
you guys that is all that I ate in the
day I really hope that you enjoyed it
and you got my fears from that these
videos are really fun for me to make and
I want you guys to understand me I make
music listen real like I don't like fake
eat like fruit bowls and like make
everything look pretty like I sit down
and like tell you guys what I eat
because like this is what I do a little
busy like college shooting has a full
time draw fish and life does a lot of
other with her life
this is living what I'm feeling my body
with and this is how I sustain myself
