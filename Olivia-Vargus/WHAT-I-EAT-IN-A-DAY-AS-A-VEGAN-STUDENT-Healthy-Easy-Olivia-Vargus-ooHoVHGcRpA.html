back to my channel if you new here my
name is Liv I upload new videos every
Monday and Friday and you should
subscribe because it's a good time today
I'm gonna be showing you what I eat in a
day I'm a busy college student and I
like to eat healthy even though I'm on
the go and really busy most of the time
I also like to try and buy things on a
budget I don't like to eat out too much
I make a lot of food at home and I'm
yoke up a lot so today I'm going to show
you everything that I've eaten in a diet
throughout the day pretty
self-explanatory let's get started
hey guys so I'm gonna start off my
morning with the donut shop dark roast
coffee this is my favorite coffee ever
this mug is from Urban Outfitters and I
got a lot of questions about it on my
fall nighttime routine and I usually
like to drink my coffee black or in some
cases I add a little bit of almond milk
creamer this one is supposed to be
pumpkin flavored and it's not bad I
don't know if I would repurchase but I
do recommend you try it if you find it
in the store I am a big fan of this
brand and all their almond milk so
that's why I gave it a try otherwise I
usually don't add creamer or anything
like that's my coffee this breakfast was
10 out of 10 so good you guys know in
the fall I love to have kind of like
cinnamon and Apple combinations this
reminds me a lot of apple turnovers
something my mom used to make or buy
from bakeries a lot so I'm using my
favorite brand of quick cut oats from
Whole Foods this is a new flax milk that
I found that has 8 grams of protein
which is so lit like to find all not
only just like an almond milk kind of
like dairy replacement but it's flax
it's not almond so there's no soy no
almond nothing like that and it's just
really good really thick and really
actually like tasty usually almond milk
sometimes a lack sort of flavor but this
one is vanilla flavored unsweetened and
it's still good I put that in the
microwave for two minutes and cut up
this Apple while I was waiting and I got
these apples at Trader Joe's this week
because it's apple season you guys you
have to eat apples
during apple season that's when they're
literally the best so I added that on
top and then a generous amount of
cinnamon and of course not Meg
not a lot of people put this much nutmeg
on their food but I say go big or go
home and it is literally so
so good after eating a couple bites of
it I thought it would be even better to
add a little bit more flax milk to it
because this kind of really makes it
taste like the apple turnovers I used to
eat growing up where we would heat them
up and then we would add the like milk
around the bowl and we would eat it like
that and I don't know if it makes any
sense or any of you guys have tried that
but it's so good I actually love this
and then after my workout I got this
from Trader Joe's and it was really good
it's vegan I know you probably can't buy
it everywhere but if you do find it I
recommend picking it up it was like four
dollars and it was really good three
servings in a container for lunch I
wanted to have pasta up her usual
because I'm literally addicted to
obsessed with pastas and I also had this
vegan it's fake vegan meat meatballs
that I've tried before that I love so
the reason I got this process because it
just looked cute and fun and it was made
of butternut squash and wheat and I
usually have lentil pasta you guys know
I love my lentil pasta it has so much
protein in it and I love eating it with
my own Fredo sauce but today I switch
things up and I got this tomato sauce
made the pasta and I made my vegan
meatballs one serving size is six
meatballs and I don't usually buy
thanked me but I really like the taste
and texture of this vegan meat that I
picked up from Trader Joe's I've tried
it before and it's actually pretty good
protein and so filling and so easy to
make
so I meal prep the pasta for a few days
of course and then I just added some
sauce to a pan and simmer that with the
meatballs and then I eat that all for
lunch this kept me more full than I
expected it to so I wasn't that hungry
for dinner
so for dinner I just want to show you
four different types of burgers that I
have been loving from this brand at
Whole Foods these are so so good and the
ingredient list on them is so good you
can just make them in the toaster oven
and you can put them on bread if you
want to I honestly just kind of eat them
as they are they taste like they're
literally like fast food like this is
the ingredient list but then I also had
some Brussels sprouts on the side
afterwards I love this one from Trader
Joe's because it just takes two minutes
to make and it's so good and that was my
dinner it was kind of a random dinner
but it was really filling I felt pretty
well nourished by the
the day and yeah that's it so as you can
tell my favorite places to shop at for
food are Whole Foods and Trader Joe's
they're really convenient and easy for
me to go to let me know if there's any
food that you think I should try at
either of those places that I didn't
show this video comment down below what
your favorite food is from either of
those places that I should go and get
