channel today I'm gonna show you what I
eat in a day as a lazy vegan who really
doesn't know how to cook but is trying
her best anyways so for breakfast I
always have just black coffee and I like
to drink the donut shop to our gross
coffee comment down below if you have
any other recommendations of any organic
maybe non plastic cake Cup brands that I
should try out because I really want to
find something new I also always add ice
cubes to my coffee just because I really
don't like when it's hot and I don't
know this is what I do isn't maybe
something you want to try it
I also had some watermelon before having
my breakfast this morning and I took
these supplements from home nutrition
for hair and nail growth and they're
vegan which is awesome because it's kind
of hard to find vegan hair supplements I
had some blu-rays right before breakfast
too because I love fruit and then for
breakfast I had oatmeal I know I know if
you've been on my channel before you
know I have oatmeal every morning but I
can't lie to you guys I can't just make
up some breakfast just to say it's what
I'm eating a day like this is the real
truth behind what I eat in a day
I always creep oatmeal and it's just the
best starts my day so right now I'm
eating it hot and I pretty much just
make it like normal and then I add some
frozen cherries to it because that kind
of pulls it down if they're frozen so I
push them in and I let them melt and
then I add some almond milk the flax
milk or whatever I have on hand to it
and then mix it all up kind of cut it up
a little bit and then that's not a
really good breakfast
and a little bit later in the day I was
starting to feel a little bit sick
switch because I can my mom's a nurse
and she always tells me to take this
whenever I feel sick and this is a
miracle vitamin C tablet I swear by it
so for lunch I made this really good
sandwich starting with Ezekiel bread and
tempeh some vegan mozzarella shreds some
tomatoes a sweet potato some olive oil a
little bit of salt never hurt nobody
some sesame bagel seasoning this looks
really good and then some garlic powder
so I make the potato like usual you can
just Google how to microwave a potato
but poke holes in it and put it the
microwave for around three minutes
depending on how much your microwave has
power and then when the sweet potato is
done I just cut it up and put it on the
stove with the temp of bacon and a
little bit of the olive oil spray and I
add all this seasoning to it
and I just kind of flip it all over and
let it all just get crispy and full
fully cooked and then I put the Ezekiel
toast with the cheese on it in the
toaster oven and then I let that melt on
top of it and then after that I add
everything together including the
tomatoes and some more seasoning and
then I cut it in half and I add those he
potatoes on the side this isn't an
amazing lunch and I'm so obsessed with
it I really recommend you try it
I've got everything from Trader Joe's
just because that was what I went to
that week but if I go to Whole Foods I
like to try the daily harvest vegan
cheese I personally think it's so much
better and I think a lot of other vegans
do too but for a Trader Joe's that's all
they have meat and cheese which is
really sad
first nap i think that these convenient
little packets of pre apportioned hummus
and pita chips and then I also had some
care as while I did some homework
because I just find it a lot more
entertaining while I'm doing homework to
snack on something so for dinner is when
usually when I get pretty lazy as a cook
and I just kind of make what I can throw
together fastest so I made these spring
rolls from Trader Joe's with the rice
cauliflower stir-fry with it and then I
just kind of made everything separately
really easy and I didn't do anything
else I just put it together and ate it
everything's pre-seasoned and the
pre-made cream I'd use it to heat it up
and that is what I had I hope you guys
liked it thanks for watching and had
amazing day love you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
