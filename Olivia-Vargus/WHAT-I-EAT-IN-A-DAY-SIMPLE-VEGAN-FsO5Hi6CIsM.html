like these videos and just see you guys
all over you didn't know by the total
I'm vegan and so this is all my vegan
breakfast and lunch actually and I've
been eating these two a lot yeah so this
is what I ate
so I started backfist with two slices of
Ezekiel bread like usual if I'm not
eating oatmeal
I'm usually eating toast and so I put
this morning it's like didn't have any
jelly like usual I took about a handful
of strawberries and I basically just
mashed them up and I added chia seeds to
that to kind of thicken it because chia
seeds are like gelatinous or whatever
then I put that on top of the toasted
eagle bread and on top of that I put
some sliced almonds and then on top of
that I stood in pb2 I did a lot of PVC
because I just really like peanut butter
and on top of that I put some hemp seeds
and so yeah and then on the side I had a
couple of days and I'm calling this my
superfood toast because there's like
chia seeds and hemp seeds and almonds
and so yeah it's really good if you
got to try that out let me know if you
like it because I really like it and
then for lunch I decided to keep it
simple I'm very very very lazy when it
comes to cooking so I never really spent
a lot of time into what I'm making so
anything that can be made under five
minutes I love so I put some asparagus
from Trader Joe's into the microwave and
it was like already seasoned but you can
even taste in these seasonings so I bet
if you just want a regular asparagus and
put it in the microwave for a couple
minutes
it would still taste good so I did that
and I cut that up and I was like what
can I eat with this
I've been eating a lot of potatoes with
like ketchup so I'm low-key kind of
stick of ketchup so I was like I want
some sriracha spice my life left a
little bit and so I was like oh the
sriracha new casinos I made a taco like
this one time that was so good so I cut
up like diced up a bunch of sweet
potatoes I think it was like three or
four and I put those in the microwave
and I put that with the asparagus we saw
the other added a bunch of sriracha and
it was so bad and so filling so I ate
again later that day but I didn't film
it he says it was like not necessary to
film cause basically just a cup beaten
grilled cheese and I made it a homeless
to slice musico bread and some like Gary
blue cheese the follow your heart grant
and it was just boring so I just didn't
put it in here so but yeah I was just -
is equal pieces of bread and just follow
your heart cheese and ketchup and that
was it and I also draw the day snapped
on an apple and two kiwi and I've been
really liked eating has been really into
eating an apple cinnamon because it's
false the apples are so good so I eat an
apple with cinnamon and then I wait like
30 minutes and I eat my food but I think
it just helps me digest my food a little
bit better because if you don't know
there's already that that's staying
where you eat or start you drink apple
cider vinegar about 30 minutes before
you eat your meal I was like well I
don't have that but I have apples and
it's supposed to just kind of help you
digest better and I think it is so if
you guys want try that out I didn't film
that either but feel free to do that and
let me know if it works for you and yeah
that's it for this week's video on
veganism I'm going to be - a grocery
haul next week when I go over to
shopping I couldn't just me because it
was just a weird week and yeah I'm also
