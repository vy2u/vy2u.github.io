my channel so today I filmed a what I'm
eating in a day video for you guys so
every morning I start off with a giant
litre of water and I drink about three
of these a day I also have a cup of
coffee first in the morning I literally
need it to be alive and wake up and I
just kind of like sit chill like be on
my computer and then after that I
usually go right into my gym downstairs
or in this case in my basement right now
and I workout and for a pre-workout
snack I'm having some this quest bar I
only plan to hop of it and then I ended
up eating the entire thing because I'm
addicted to Clif bars this is what I had
for breakfast I just made a pretty basic
cup of quick oats with my quick cut Oh
two cups of almond milk actually I think
this is one cup of almond milk because
that's what this recipe called for
anyways I put that in the microwave for
two minutes and it cooks really well so
I always use unsweetened almond milk and
I really love this one that I just use
because it just keeps so good he said
gets sweetened but it's not and for
toppings I added some fresh-cut
strawberries and some almond butter and
here's a snack that had later on in the
day when I was hanging out with my
friends I've always wanted to try one of
those Lobo bars so this is also my
second liter of water that I'm showing
you right now the boba bar was kind of
dry so I don't really recommend it
wasn't really like satisfactory either
but I was really hungry so I need to see
something then I cut up some watermelon
and some strawberries and I ate that as
a snack
you know Suns going down it's kind of
like a pre-dinner snack I love
watermelon it makes me feel so just
hydrated and cleanse on the inside I
definitely want to make like a
watermelon juice to summer and show you
guys like the recipe because that's
happening from stores before and they're
so good and so I'm just chilling outside
relaxing eating my screw enjoying life
now for dinner I wanted to make
something a little bit different so this
is something I've never tried before it
was from cool food
honestly I give this like a six out of
ten I've made my own jackfruit if
sandwiches and it came out better but
this is just pre-made so it's a lot
easier to make you have to go through
like hours of prepping the drafts proof
so it's also a Zico bread hamburger
that I found at the store and some green
peas I would I always buy organic
because I didn't feel like it's better I
feel the people with water and I put it
in microwave for two minutes and then I
drain the water and I add pepper and
this is my favorite thing ever sometimes
I literally just eat this and it's
really good protein so this is what my
finished dinner looks like I had the
Ezekiel bread hamburger bun which was
pretty good I've never seen it anywhere
else but if you find it I recommend
trying it and then I had the job food
sandwich and it was good I think overall
it could have been like more more saucy
I love some good sauce I ended up adding
some lettuce because it was dry but yeah
I think buying barbecue sauce to go with
this would have been good it wasn't like
the most healthy meal but it was
definitely filling between all of those
things from the Ezekiel bread the peas
and then a little bit from the jock
fruit and I had some water so that was
just about it that's all I had in the
day so I really hope that you guys liked
this video and got some ideas give it a
thumbs up if you want to see more videos
like this for me and I will see you guys
next week with an all-new video thank
you so much for watching bye
