my channel if you're new here my name is
live so today I'm going to be vlogging a
cheat day in my life
I make a lot of what I eat in a day
videos and I eat a vegan plant-based
diet every Saturday I take a cheat day
where I eat whatever I want inside
whatever I'm craving and it's honestly
the best day of my week so today I'm
going to bring you along with me and
showing you everything that I eat in a
day in a log style on Saturday before
you watch this video comment down below
what you think I should eat for cheat
day next week if you have any
suggestions I live in Los Angeles so if
you know any specific restaurants let a
girl know so before I show you
everything I just want to give a little
explanation on why even do cheat days so
for the most part I really hoped you
throughout the week and you have a lot
of foods and I'm in classes and I'm busy
and I'm working so I don't have time to
really even eat out and it's also just
expensive to eat out so I don't really
like to so then when it gets to Saturday
it's usually when I'm all out of
groceries and Saturdays are also the
first day the weekend so on Saturdays my
roommate and I about a year ago started
the tradition where we would just go out
and we would just live it up thrive
however we camp and just do whatever our
intuition tells us to do so sometimes we
do eat and healthy on cheat days
sometimes we eat like five meals on
Tuesdays and honestly you know ten
thousand calorie challenge we probably
have done that once or twice
accidentally the loose science and cheat
day because a lot of professional
nutritionists but from what I've heard
is that if you eat a lot of really bad
food in one day and the next day you
just go back to like your regular diet
it's almost good for your metabolism
because it helps it to speed up and it
helps it to work extra hard to get rid
of and burn those extra calories that
are in your that is in your body and
it's not gonna kill you it's not gonna
make you gain any weight if it's just
one day out of the week it takes 3,000
calories to gain one pound so I think
that's probably around where we eat for
Tuesday's we go about it in the way of
just enjoying our lives that day so a
lot of time on Saturdays we don't even
just go and get food we make an entire
day around it by going to
restaurants and going and trying new
places and it's just fun it's just a
relaxing day for us because we're crazy
busy throughout the week and so by the
time Saturday comes were like oh I've
been wanting to do this all week or I've
been wanting this all week and so it's
just the perfect day just lines up
really well but without further ado time
to show you my cheat day I feel like
it'll be fun to do like a before and
after of what I look like after cheat
day in the morning I always drink a
liter of water a cup of coffee and then
a small breakfast so this morning I had
some toast as equal bread with so you
can get this at Trader Joe's and
basically it's just peanut butter
without all the fat but it's processed
and it doesn't really taste that good so
I use like very very little just to make
the bread not so dry so I use probably
one tablespoon of this on two pieces of
bread and I do that because I don't like
having a workout on an empty stomach so
I like having something in me and that's
a pretty light and like easy to digest
food and now it's 11 o'clock I hate that
at like 9:00 but now I'm gonna wait for
my roommate to get home and we're gonna
get a ciggy bullseye always got a say on
Saturdays because it's just a tradition
typically we used to always go hiking
and then we would get us a bowls and
that was our tradition but now we can't
hike anymore various reasons but I still
got to work out in this morning and then
when she gets home we'll have and I say
well I'll show you that I don't even
know this about me you guys but I have
like very wide hips like this is my bone
you physically can't you can't push on
it so like this is just like as thin
when I get really thin this is literally
just what it looks like so my goal right
now is to bulk up my side of my glutes
and make it sort of even out so I have
one nice hourglass shape but I do love
my body as I am right now I did just
tweet the other day that I'm confident
in my body not because of what it looks
like but because of all that it took for
me to accept it and to just learn about
it and and also to make it strong so I
don't put as much pressure on myself
anymore until like have the perfect
society figure I'm just like you know
what I love what I got rocking what I
got and I'm gonna continue to improve on
what I got for me and no one else
anyways yeah so this is my body
okay so this is the official first meal
of my cheat day that I get every single
week on Saturday quench is a chain in
Los Angeles and they make the best acai
bowls I honestly don't trust anyone else
to make my ass ie bowls I also don't get
banana in it because I kind of have like
an intolerance
I still eat bananas on my own but I'd
never get them from restaurants so this
basically has a serving of peanut butter
in it granola and strawberries maca hemp
seeds and then obviously a thigh a
blended with almond milk and frozen
strawberries and as you can see it's
really really big this is really heavy
too it always fills me up a lot and
keeps me full for over a long time and
it's also just so refreshing it's you
guys already know this is my favorite
food but if you didn't know then now you
know so here's just a little bit of
proof that I do always finish my a
Sables I've never not finished now say
well that would be really rare but yeah
two thumbs up
long like it looks good
it's like there's probably takes longer
okay so in the restaurant it was like
really loud I think I couldn't really
talk so I just had like an overview what
I got
basically Keanu and I split everything
and we got so much because we were we
were craving a lot of different things
and we wanted to just like try
everything and I was really painting
fried food and now of course Chi Day is
never complete without some dessert so
so we're gonna do nut this on the left
is Cinna holic and I've been here before
I put it all over my snap stories this
is where they make the vegan cinnamon
rolls and you make it yourself with the
frosting and the toppings and I get few
dough and it's so good next to it is an
ice cream plates called Benji's and I've
never been here before but it's also all
vegan so we're gonna try this today this
mint ice cream is so good and then we've
got little sides of Oreos the current
mood yeah today was a good day usually
it's just my roommate and I am we just
going like get food out like one place
and we just like hang out and we'll like
go to the Grove a lot and like whatever
else we feel like doing the moment but
today we were with like a group of
people doing the photo shoot and I also
still usually drink a lot of water even
though it's my cheat days so I've had
two liters of water today and now I'll
probably just drink one more for the
rest of the night probably watch a movie
Saturday night you know gotta live it up
for the most part I think it looks like
a pretty decent blog but I'll probably
continue just showing my cheat days I'm
like my Instagram and my snapchat and
stuff so make sure you follow me there
if you are interested in more stuff like
this I'm honestly too tired to move
right now I don't think I can get up
also I want to say I know a lot of
people tend to like to compare
themselves when they watch when I eat in
a day videos and I just want to remind
you please so but I do just want to say
if you guys try and compare yourselves
to me or your regular normal day diets
my cheat day diet don't bother I'm not
changing what I do just to please you
and you shouldn't change what you're
doing if you're happy doing what you're
doing don't worry about what I'm doing
you know I just felt like I had a bit
disclaimer in there because I know where
we wanted to comment saying something
about my diet or some
give us a few phones if you liked it
love you guys so much and I will see you
later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
