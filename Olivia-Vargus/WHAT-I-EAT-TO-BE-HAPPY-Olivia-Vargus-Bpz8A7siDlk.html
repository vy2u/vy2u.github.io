my channel today when we showing you
what I eat in a day to be happy the
reason I want to make this video title
what I eaten it to be happy it's because
I want to talk about intuitive eating I
got this video idea from Limpy who's a
vegan and I could follow him a long time
I will have her video link down below
and I think you should go watch her
video because she does an amazing job at
explaining just intuitive eating and I
just love her mindset about it I was
talking a little bit more but intuitive
eating later on in the blog but I want
to tell you guys about my breakfast
right now so for breakfast this morning
before I went to the gym I went to
Starbucks and I got their oatmeal with
steamed on the milk and I put the packet
of nuts that they give you on top and
then they also give you a packet of
dried fruit I also got an iced latte
with almond milk to go with this because
I love iced latte shout out at my
Chamberlain cuz I never had that before
watching her after the dream I came home
and I snapped arms and beet chips and
some oil free hummus that I found at
Whole Foods and this is a really
expensive brand and I really like a lot
of their other vegan products if you've
never tried them you should check them
out I don't want you guys going out and
buying a bag of like $5 beet chips and
then getting mad at me for not liking
them because I want to let you guys know
that I never liked beets no one is born
liking beets you force yourself to like
them and then once you force yourself to
like them like they're literally the
most amazing thing ever I don't know why
but I crave them 24/7 they're high in
fiber they're just so good for you you
feel good eating them this video is
sponsored by a brand that I really love
called care of so carob delivers daily
vitamin and supplement packs customized
to promote health and wellness in order
to get your customized path you just
have to take a quick five-minute quiz
the quiz will help to determine what's
uplands you should be taking I really
enjoyed that the quiz helping me find
personalized recommendations because I
feel kind of overwhelmed by how many
vitamins and just different supplements
there are in the world but I felt like
carob really cared about you know what I
actually felt I needed to the
supplements that I was recommended were
magnesium calcium b12 and probiotic as a
vegan I definitely am concerned about
being low in b12 because that's the only
essential amino acid that you lack on a
vegan diet I also learned that calf
can deplete your calcium and I didn't
know that and I drink a lot of caffeine
coffee every morning so I've been taking
my care up supplements every day for
about a week now and I've just been
noticing positive changes in general
just in my mood and my energy levels so
everyone carrots ends are your
supplements and I keep mine on the
counter near where I drink my coffee in
the morning so that way every day when
I'm drinking my coffee or I'm leaving
the house I just grab a supplement
package and I love that on the package
they have little motivational quotes I
also love that Kara puts your name on
everything because again the company is
all about personalizing things for you
and your own needs so now I have a 25%
off discount code for you to use on your
first month of care of the discount code
is Olympia a and it is on the screen and
it is in the description I highly
recommend you go check them out and take
your carob quiz and get your own
personalized supplement packs for
yourself now without further ado what
let's talk about some foods so I've been
wanting to address this in a video for
Rio now and I think this is the perfect
video to do so so I want to talk about
how when I make videos that are talking
about what I'm eating a day it's not
split you can compare your diet mine or
project yourself onto the video I make
those videos so that you have an idea of
you know if you're vegan or you're a
college student or you just are trying
to be a little bit healthier and cleaner
with your diet you can maybe get some
inspiration from what I'm eating in some
of the recipes that I make but we have
two different genetic bodies we're both
human but we are completely different
people and so what I eat it should be
exactly what you eat everybody is a
beautiful body as I always say and what
matters is that you feel good at all
times when I'm hungry I'm gonna eat
until I'm full until I'm satisfied until
when I feel good so what I eat no need
to be happy is basically just saying
this video is about my diet and it's
about how I eat to be intuitive and
listening to your own body and what you
want to eat
I don't want talking circles for too
long so I'm gonna leave Olivia B's video
down below and I really recommend that
you go and check it out because she did
a really good job at explaining
intuitive eating so now I'm gonna
continue with my afternoon I have a few
things to get done and then I'm going to
eat
a little bit and I'll see you then okay
so right now it's about 2 p.m. and I'm
so hungry so I'm gonna grab my lunch
that I have for myself in my fridge and
I'll show you it yes wow I love past me
for doing this for myself so this is
what I'm gonna be eating for lunch today
it's a vegan spicy veggie roll some of
you guys know that I have an avocado
allergy so I'm gonna take the avocado
out of each of these before I eat it I
wish that Whole Foods sold like a sushi
that's vegan but out of a carro but they
don't and I've been getting this one so
much recently and I literally love it
I'm sorry boss I swear I second-guessed
drywall's grocery shopping because I was
really craving sushi but I didn't have
time to eat it that day so I got one for
myself to eat today and I love one past
me it does stop for future me like
things live so all that's really in this
is the vegan spicy mayo carrots and
cucumber and and obviously avocado which
I'm taking out this is like a very basic
roll is basically just think of it as a
cucumber avocado roll but it has a spicy
mayo so I'm sure you can get the talk to
Whole Foods where you live or Trader
Joe's has vegan sushi literally anywhere
except that South sushi always has some
sort of cucumber roll should I put this
on a plate and make it look good for the
thumbnail I really just want to eat it
I'm gonna do it I'll be right back
here's the avocado if I already eat that
I'd be in pain for the rest of the day
obviously there's still like a little
bit of avocado left in the sushi but
it's not enough to hurt me at all
ok so it's about 3 o'clock now and I'm
starting to get thirsty so like I said
I'm wondering some water now this is 1
liter and so I drink 3 of these a day
which is kind of a lot but like I said I
work out so it's good to drink water
after you work out and during your
workouts people relate the hydrophone
square it now but I'm gonna knock down
spend $50 on a water bottle so I just
love my $20 Target
Camelbak right now if you really need
help trick more water and go out the day
I really recommend these water bottles
everybody loves them I bring them
everywhere with me so with the water I'm
also gonna have the rest of this cold
brew coffee from Whole Foods that was on
sale yesterday it's this brand
dumptown it's so strong and I drink half
of it yesterday before my finals because
I need your energy to get through that
oh my god okay so it is about 5:30 right
now and I am starving it luckily this
dinner doesn't take long to make this is
the ancient harvest lento pasta from
Whole Foods and and it has 25 grams of
protein in it I also own this red lentil
pasta from Trader Joe's right now but I
never find it to be as filling as the
other one I'm gonna put the vegan brown
beef into a pan and I'm gonna have this
okay so I'm gonna make all this together
at one okay I know my kitchen isn't like
aesthetically pleasing I'm a college
student don't judge me I'm gonna clean
this um stove when I'm done here this is
cooking up right now and then I just put
this pasta in here so it should start to
like Bend into the pot pretty soon if
you're making lentil pasta I highly
recommend that you do it in a really big
pot otherwise because of all the starch
on lendo pasta it does tend to bubble up
a lot and this vegan me is pretty much
done cooking it's all crispy and it
looks pretty good all right so I put
together my little meal prep for the
next two days and I'll just add sauce
and meat the day that I actually cook
them and eat them so this is the sauce
from Trader Joe's that I'm gonna be
using okay so this is dinner I know it
doesn't look pretty at all but there's a
lot of protein in here and it's gonna be
really filling so last thing that I'm
gonna eat today is the chocolate
dairy-free halo top this is my favorite
the whole pint is like really low in
calories just because it's basically
just coconut milk with like chocolate
flavor but it's so so good so this is
gonna be last something to eat today so
I hope that you guys like this video if
you did give it a thumbs up and
subscribe down below and I will see you
guys later
luck hi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
