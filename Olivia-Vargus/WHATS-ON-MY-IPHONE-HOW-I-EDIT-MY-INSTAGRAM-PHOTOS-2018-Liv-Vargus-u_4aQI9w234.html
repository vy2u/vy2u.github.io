my channel if you're new here my name is
Liv I make new videos every Monday and
Friday it's a good time feel free to
subscribe and join our family today's
video I'm just gonna show you how I
organize all the apps of my iPhone and
the apps that I love and want to share
with you and then when I do a quick
updated version on how I edit my
Instagram pictures because I've recently
changed it around since the last time I
film that video so might as well show
you what I do now before you watch this
video comment down below what percent
your phone is on right now mine's on 32%
because I'm such a prepared person like
you would think of charged my phone
before filming a video about my phone
but no it's just not me I guess I'm
gonna scoot over to the side here so
that I can put my thing right here so
I'm always tweeting out the pictures of
what my wallpapers are so that you guys
can use them too so I've already tweeted
this but this is what my wallpaper looks
like right now and I really love it
because it's just a constant reminder so
sure that social media just reminding
myself to look for value within and not
from like external sources so yeah
people all stepped on my toe time and I
believe that this is the photo that I
have saved for my home screen wallpaper
right now because I want I like
something neutral so that it doesn't
like distract me alright well welcome to
my iPhone so I keep everything on one
screen just to keep it like organized in
minimal I don't like to have anything on
any other screens so I'll go into the
categories one by one but first at the
top I just have the iTunes Store app
store Safari cloth which I'll use at the
timer on or else an alarm on settings
weather calendar and notes and then down
at the bottom I have my mail messages
phone and camera pretty basic boring in
for me so the categories that we have
our photography social media music
shopping food travel wellness and I
okay and if you don't know how to name a
category you just tap on it and you just
hold it down and then you can change the
name and I just used emojis to name all
of them I thought that would be cute so
let's work our way backwards this first
folder it has absolutely nothing
Medicare about it and like that's just
that it's just all the random stuff that
icons come with the next category is
wellness so this has my period with life
app and I don't really know which one it
is I just chose it for like the top
charts for like period apps and then I
have my fitness pal which I don't really
use religiously but every once in a
while I like to look something up and
then I have this app for the life
purpose app and this so this app is the
app that goes with my book my life
purpose book that I love and I've told
you guys from the beginning of my
channel affair but of all time like
change my life
it's about numerology so as you can see
here my length path is 33 / 6 so you can
just enter your birth date and it'll
give you this a new life path it'll cut
a minute for you
so 33 / 6 life path so the 3 represents
expression 6 represents a vision if you
have a double number like idea that
means that interesting is amplified so
expression aka I'm highly sensitive and
yeah you can read this if you want to
but this is everything about me it's the
most accurate like reading of me I've
ever ever ever heard basically
numerology is the studying odd numbers
affect you so it's the same thing as
zodiac signs how zodiac sign started off
by people would measure time through the
stars and started to measure how it
would affect people and thus horoscopes
were born and now the same thing is with
numerology they've been studying it for
a long long time and how numbers affect
us so this app was like 10 dollars and
the book was also like 10 dollars so if
you don't want to get the book at the
app you have that app you don't need get
the book whatever you wanted it and I
have this app called relax melodies
which I occasionally listen to an
abundance leap at night when I have
insomnia but not often I'll play like
the night sounds and like the slow waves
because I grew up listening to the waves
when I fell asleep on Cape Cod and then
I have podcasts my favorite podcasts are
the create your own magic
Ali Michelle and workout mantras and
then I have books I pretty much put like
cookbooks in here
mr. and mrs. vegan make a lot of really
good downloadable ebooks so I like those
and then type wrong I do not use and
then audible we all know the next is
just travel so I'm ways maps and then
JetBlue the next is food so if you've
never used happy cow it's basically Yelp
for vegans and vegetarians it helps you
to find restaurants and just stores
around you and then under kind of like
any money things like shopping or any
finances I have been mode because
everyone has been I'm pretty sure and
then dope which is a new app that
everyone has been loving and freaking
out over I decided to give it a try so I
just downloaded it feel free to follow
me on dote I will link it down below you
have not done anything on it yet except
for give myself a profile picture so I
only have subscriptions to Spotify and
Apple music my Spotify playlists are so
good if you're not following them I will
link that down below to my favorite ones
right now are this one I just made which
is where I like this heavy dramatic
tonight and I was listening to dramatic
music and I was like I need to get need
a good playlist for this so it's called
you know what I really am a dramatic
bitch and I also have my January
favorites famous which I have made a
video on you can go watch that but I am
literally I add with three new songs to
that every day and I also use my workout
January playlist the most right now and
then under social media it's pretty
self-explanatory do I think that's new
here you might not know of it's time hop
which tells you like your life that same
day like didn't like the past of
whatever mind goes back like six years
like Facebook when I was like in middle
school and it's really cringey
and then also we heard it which is what
I told you guys about you don't need to
follow me in here because this is kind
of like an app I don't really want
followers on I just want to like keep it
for myself and I find things like
Twitter headers and wallpapers and a lot
of times I like tweet mood boards
alright so now my favorite section on my
phone is my photography section so I
keep instagramming here because usually
from the
photo editing apps and putting it on
Instagram so I will walk you through how
I edit a photo and I'll pretty much try
and use all these apps the ones that I
won't use are visco which is just like a
plain editing app that almost everybody
uses I got sick of them filters I want
it to be different from the crowd you
know so that's why I use darkroom
filters but I do still use vsco filters
to add green to photos could you can't
do that anywhere else really and then
two really cool apps if you don't
already have them are cured here and
Coogi oh here here is just that app that
makes everything Sparkle so as you can
see you just like sparkle when you use
it and I don't know if it's cool and
then this app I don't think many people
know about yet and I think it's gonna
blow up really soon it's called Fuji I
don't actually not say it
Fuji like Fuji films it's basically a
disposable camera on your phone so you
can tap on this and I'm going to turn it
around so you just take a photo and it
develops and you go into the lab and
then this is what the photo looks like
so it usually asks like down here you
can't even see it on this model it'll
add like a date stamp I think that is
taken on a real disposable camera I
don't know it just makes it look really
cool so I've been seeing one people
though he upload photos using this app I
don't think a lot of people know about
it yet but I'm telling you now you guys
it's gonna be a good office this year
first up when I get a photo is I usually
go to face tune and I wait in the
background just to make it all cuz I
just makes it look really clear and
crisp and I love a good contrast I love
a good black and white photo so like
this photo for example I was editing and
like you can see the difference if you
want to pull up the down down the before
and after between the white and the
yellow like it just makes a big
difference and then I'm gonna go into
dark room so then I used to always use a
100 for all my photos because I liked
how pink it was you know I think the
photo that I'm editing right now
as a filter on it but it doesn't matter
I'm just showing you filters so just
ignore that but see how it just kind of
makes it really pink which I like but
recently I've been using a load of
portraits p400 and this is just kind of
a cool tone which I really love and for
the photo that I recently posted of like
my jeans and t-shirt that was eight to
ten so this is like a really warm filter
and then of course we all know and love
leash that's the old fee that I used to
have make all of my photos have like a
rainbow cliche fax glitch I don't know
glitch effect on them and I'll probably
do that again in the summer I do it
everyone so I'm here and there but I
stopped because I it just kept messing
up with photos that I was like oh I kind
of wish I didn't put this on the photo
and now it's I don't know so let me know
if you want glitch to come back by
popular demand I will bring it back but
let me know then when I'm done editing
the photo I'll go into this snag app
which is basically it plans your feet
out for you hold down the photo and they
can move it around see what looks the
best this is my pre-existing feed um but
yeah that's pretty much it if you liked
this video please give it a thumbs up
and subscribe if you are new here I love
you guys so much and I hope that you
were out it was amazing day tonight and
have an amazing weekends and I will see
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
