welcome back my name is Liv I make new
videos every Monday and Friday it's a
good time feel free to subscribe and
join her family here so kyon and I just
drove to Malibu today Saturday when we
usually go hiking but I overslept this
morning so hard I really didn't mean to
so we kind of skipped out on going
hiking and we're like let's just go to
Malibu and so because we love going to
Malibu when we have like a whole day to
do it and it's just like the best
feeling ever to be by the ocean outside
of the city and to just be around like
calm energy so that's what we're here
and we're gonna grab some food and have
a picnic on the beach but yeah vlog my
week 3 officially starts right now
time go to my favorite place to come in
out like it was just like I don't know
how to explain this place but this place
we drove all the way to Malibu to get
Chipotle for life in there yeah for real
he was beautiful so we just got to the
beach across the street this is a very
very very happy live oh that's gotta be
my favorite view in LA no definitely
finally after like the longest walk ever
there's the ocean this looks like a
desktop screen saver
ah what box Oh rocks
alright so we just took some pics
hopefully we got like a good one or two
good grams and now we get to eat a
burrito I know it's kind of random I
just changed my top I brought a shirt
with me from brand eval I wore a bunch
of time it's in my last vlog this is
what dreams are made of I'm like holding
it like it's my child and I'm like proud
of it so I got both black beans and
pinto beans I got both rice white and
brown because I only wanted brown but
she gave me white and I was like okay
and I got the mild salsa and lettuce and
I got it in a burrito because I decided
I wanted to love myself good morning you
guys this is my outfit right now to go
to crunch and get NASA a bowl because I
really really want one today it's gonna
be a really good day I can already feel
it and I already know I'm just wearing
my champion joggers brandy melville top
key sunglasses and some fashion over
slides my room is so messy this is the
worst it has ever been in my entire span
of living here so we're gonna clean this
today and we have a few other things
planned today that I'm really excited
about first step of course is we need to
eat some food to fuel us so quench my
love I'm coming for you
just enjoying the nature of downtown la
oh well more the beautiful
trees by that I mean pigeons and dying
palm trees I could not it up flip
it up flip it up talk about how I
haven't taken that box out yet like it's
been there for a few vlogs now but I'm
gonna thrive and eat my breakfast and
watch some TV okay so now it's about
four o'clock in the afternoon and I
spend all day at cleaning the apartment
so so well it still needs a lot of work
but you know there's a difference
between organizing and cleaning and you
plate the place need to be cleaned
really badly and then when I was
cleaning my room I got inspired and let
me just show you what I ended up doing
tada
I moved my room around
mm-hmm so I know this is like kind of
surprising my bed was like always over
there it's my bed has been over here
before but it's been a long time and I
just felt like I need to change there's
two things I do whenever I feel like I'm
going through a period of like change or
just or just like transforming and like
moving on from the past the two things
that I do are moved my room around and
getting my hair done so I just move my
room and I have a hair appointment next
week so I think it's cute I think it's
nice to have like a little bit more room
a little change of scenery and I can now
sit there and film videos because that
was kind of an awkward struggle to I'm
kind of treating life like I'm on like
my vacation right now and I'm just like
I don't want to be in routine I don't
want anything to feel like it was the
last time weeks like I just want to like
so I've in every second and be in the
present moment because for the past 10
weeks I've just been like what's next
what's next like I was never in the
present moment I was always chasing the
next step and then like just always
stressed out so right now I'm like so
like at peace with like the present
moment and just like being intuitive and
listening to myself and what I want to
do and what I want to eat and not like
oh I need to do this so loking so much
pain for my period right now like my
lower back hurts so bad but while my
clothes are in the dryer for an hour I'm
just going to go downstairs and try and
kill like 30 minute cardio 30 minute
like weight training session and then
like come back upstairs and pass out
after putting my laundry away I'm just
saying but honestly quench if you want
to sponsor any of my videos business
email will be down below this coming
have I worn this sweatshirt in a vlog
before comment below if you know the
answer just kidding I'm not you don't
need to do that I don't blame you if you
don't know the answer I don't know the
answer sorry for the low image quality
but I just want to show you that I got a
vegan BLT with like vegan mayo and the
bacon is like a tempeh bacon so for
those of you who might be wondering what
my Travel routine is it's to wait until
the very last minute it's a pack and
then have an anxiety so I currently just
put self-tanner all over my body and I
it's the kind that you like shower app
off after a few hours and then I also
put coconut oil in my hair this is my
attempt at trying to fool the people
when I go home on the East Coast into
thinking that I'm living not like sunny
warm Cali lifestyle even though I don't
leave my bedroom I have pretty much
everything good to go I have mainly
workout clothing and then I have pants
on one side tops on another shoes in the
middle and then extra space because I
have to put like my toiletries there in
the morning and because if I buy stuff
while I'm home like Christmas gifts and
I want to have space to bring it back I
get a lot of anxiety while traveling
especially alone so tomorrow it's gonna
be quick quite an interesting day
honey so I have my own mason jar at home
because I'm very extra but I just woke
up and now I'm gonna drink my coffee out
of my Cape Cod mug because corny as hell
but whatever No oh hi she's saying hi
say hi everybody but you're so cute
look at all the Christmas cookies that
my mom has made none of these are vegan
no so I'm safe I don't have to eat them
I didn't know these existed
I mean eat this for breakfast this one's
like a really strong ginger flavor
I actually don't love it I feel like I
would love this one now so we're gonna
eat this instead I don't think that I've
loved any like talking clips yesterday I
think I just did like montage clips of
my traveling because it's not really fun
to watch me travel for 12 hours but I'm
back on Cape Cod right now and I'm very
happy under the car my mom is driving
she's had a dentist appointment but
we're gonna go to the mall go Christmas
shopping right now cuz I have I'm a lot
like anything for anyone yet okay so I
pretty much it didn't vlog any of my
trip to the mall or to Whole Foods but
let me do a little haul so I got this
clean getaway a travel kit from this
brand that I've used before and I forgot
makeup remover which was a struggle last
night when I was in the bed I got my
brother present I got more of these
shakes I think I showed them earlier in
the vlog but I'm gonna have them after
workouts and they're so so good they're
vegan you can get the best GNC and
there's no sugar and them but they taste
really good still then I also got a
bunch of new pairings because um what
happened I don't know but the ones that
I'm wearing completely like rusted in my
ear which is awful and it does not feel
good so I picked up a bunch of new ones
and they're so cute - the first one I
got are these stars but really really
cute because they're just simple but
they still have like I don't know I
think you cuz they're stars they sound
gonna do I've been living on these ones
I thought were so cute so you put them
in and then the like bar behind them
hides behind your ear and then they like
show the moon underneath like the
Loeb I don't like the words Loeb and
then I got another pair of star earrings
some extra so legit got three star
earrings and then these ones are just
little lightning bolts which were really
cute so now I'll show you some of my
favorite like grocery things that I just
picked up at Whole Foods these are some
meatballs that I picked up in the frozen
section that are vegan I also haven't
had any Guardian chicken fingers and so
long and I saw them and I was like oh I
don't want them I found this vegan
flatbread next to the die of Eagan stuff
and it looked so good I was like oh my
god I have to get that this vegan
hilltop flavor is really really good
there's like caramel swirls in it and I
thought my family would like to try it
I call it this I'm gonna try and make it
but I have a feeling already that I'm
gonna not know what to do with it but
we'll find out here are some more like
meatless crumbs and then the last thing
that I got are these two things in the
like pre-made section okay yes I just
heated this up in the microwave and I'm
living for this I just realize also how
like brown and boring this looks on
camera I mean I don't know about you I
look kind of crazy but I'm living the
life right now oh my god you guys are
completely forgot that I was vlogging a
friend literally just came over for like
three hours and I completely forgot oh
great lating love this okay my dog has
to go to the bathroom but I'm home alone
and she's been kind of crying for a few
minutes and I feel so bad cuz like
imagine your dog like you have to pee
and I told her I was like I would rather
you pee on the ground and I'll just
clean it up like do what you need to do
like I don't mind but don't make me go
outside and she didn't listen shouldn't
cares you're selfish she's still crying
I'm gonna go outside
she took the bathroom thirty degrees out
I found this really cute book in my room
that I got it for like Christmas early
for a present time ago it has all these
really really cute drawings me this is
me as though this is the book if you
want to go out and get it probably can
get at Barnes &amp;amp; Noble good morning so I
can't look dumb right now um I'm wearing
the same Swisher that I've been wearing
literally every day in this vlog but
today is my hair appointment diet
because I'm jet black it took already
ten o'clock today and just woke up and
my grandparents flew in from Florida
last night which is cool so they're
downstairs right now I just said hi to
them and I have like an hour to get
ready and then I'm going to go to the
hair appointment I'm not gonna get ready
I like to put on like makeup when I go
to here appointment because I want to
make sure that like the hairstylist sees
what I see but I did a poll on Instagram
and I think we're gonna go blonde I have
like an idea what I want but like I'm so
bad at communicating that so we'll see
how it goes and I know I look better as
a brunette like this is my natural like
this is 100% my natural hair color
because that's what's been growing out
for a while now I know I look but ours
brunette but this is the only
opportunity that I have to go blonde for
like a long time and they're probably
like next year I'll go back to dark and
I'll just stay darker like make my hair
Li healthy but this year this is the
year of growing up this is the year of
trying new things so if you're watching
this video I hope this motivates you to
go and try new things
maybe you don't go but the dye your hair
blonde but we'll see I'm not like dying
the roots or anything like I'm hoping
that like this one we'll see how goes
we're gonna do a big hair reveal I'm
really wearing the same jacket that I
wear every time I come home I don't own
another winter jacket just this one from
free people from like 2014 15 one of
those years but it just keeps me warm
and why would I ever need to buy another
winter jacket like live in California
this might be the last time you ever see
me with his hair
okay guys are you ready to see the hair
of you obviously kept the bottom blondes
now we have an all-over blonde oh my god
so the lighting in here is really bad
you really can't tell what it actually
looks like I will be posting a whole lot
more on my Instagram and snapchat
stories today that this video goes up so
you can really see it but I wanted to
show you guys the best that I could
because I suddenly outside is also going
down it's at 4 o'clock so I was like oh
my god are you filming this before it
gets dark out and I can't use any of the
natural lighting we basically did ombre
all the way up to the roots because we
didn't want to do foils since that would
just be too dramatic of a difference so
I freaking love it I love that it's ash
like it's like an ashy blonde I don't
know if you can like tell what it looks
like on the screen right now you really
can't tell how it looks with this
sweatshirt on and everything right now
yeah let me know what you think down
below it obviously doesn't translate
onto this camera with this lighting that
well right now I just moved into another
bathroom in my house to try and get
better lighting but it's still the Sun
is literally going down so feel free to
let me know what you think of my new
hair in the comments down below I'd love
to hear your feedback on you know the
blonde the new look new year new Mutis
