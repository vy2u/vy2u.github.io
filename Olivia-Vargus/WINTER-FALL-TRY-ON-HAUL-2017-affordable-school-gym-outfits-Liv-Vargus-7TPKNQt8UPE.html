to my channel if you're new here my name
is Liv I make new videos every my name
Friday at 4 new feel free to subscribe
and join our family I also really want
to say briefly before I get into this
video that some of you might know that
little peep is one of my favorite
artists and he passed away and I want to
give my respects to him and take a
moment to just say how much I loved and
cared and appreciated him and his music
and everything that he contributed to
this world and to the music industry I'm
so heartbroken by his passing so I want
to say that because I just wanted to
give my respect to him and to his family
rest in peace little peep I will link in
the description a Spotify playlist of
all my favourite songs by him what is
that noise so on a completely different
note today I'm gonna be doing a try on
haul I got a lot of different stuff to
show you guys I think Tryon halls are so
boring you guys like I'm just so I'm so
serious so we're just gonna go through
these really fast two things I want to
say one is that all the things that I'm
showing you are going to be in the
description so you can find the links
because I'm here for you I've got you
guys second being that I understand if
you want to just pause the video just
click all the links and not even pay
attention to me but I do think it's
worth it to watch the video to hear all
of my input on the sizing and all of my
input on the quality of the clothing
that I'm showing you because this is
definitely that kind of video without
further ado let's get into our first
store I'm gonna be showing you
everything that I got from boohoo boohoo
always has 50% off so they're super
super affordable I went to their site
looking for track suits because I am
just obsessed with track suits right now
wearing them to class wearing them to
target right now junior joes and when i
say i got track suits oh wait we did i
get track suits
the first one that i'm going to show you
is my favorite one that I got and it's
just a black and red striped track suit
and this one fits the best out of all
the other ones that I got but this is
the cropped hoodie for it and then these
are the joggers so they're both black
with a red stitching along the sides as
like a fun little detail they kind of
look like they're knock-offs with like
the Danielle Guzzi oh Sh dudes and so
that's why
like them cuz they're half the price the
next track seat that I got is just an
all red maroon tracksuit this one is a
little little a little bit too thick I
think that the sweatshirt I can crop it
with some scissors a little bit more and
like fray the end so that it works but
the joggers the inseam between the
crotch and the top like a honey it's a
little bit too much and you can't even
roll it because they have pockets so the
joggers are a little bit too big
hopefully I can maybe shrink them in the
wash if anything I knew when ordering
for mood that I was risking the sizing a
lot because I've never tried them before
and they're pretty sure UK brand but if
anything my doubt was like I could just
wear them to bed like I can just wear
them around the house so it doesn't
really matter if they didn't fit because
it's like each of these was probably
around 10 to 20 dollars and I think that
they're just really comfortable this is
a great example of what I mean because
this next one did not fit at all the top
I don't mind it's a yellow top and it
has a black stripe down the side but the
top is too long you can definitely crop
this on your own with some scissors and
make it into a crop top I just don't
think that if this is supposed to be
high-waisted and this is the waistband
like this is just too big for a size
small or this is a size 6 so I would
definitely go down in this one the next
shocks you didn't wanna show you from
boohoo is really cute and I think it's
gonna be great for Christmas when I go
home because it's just covered in stars
and these are the pants first is what
I'm showing you but they are
high-waisted definitely see-through so
maybe wear a jacket over them but I
think that these would be really cute
even just on their own with like a white
top tied to the side even like the one
that I'm wearing and then like a blacks
like jacket over it and just some Air
Force Ones you know my you know my vibe
and then this is the top that goes with
it and it's also a crewneck top which I
love and I think that the stars on this
are a little annoying because they're
like a little itchy and just like cheap
feeling but honestly I think that it's
still a cute piece to wear it to bed or
just to wear like on each piece
separately I think together it's but
like separately I think they look really
cute
the next piece from boohoo is white crop
top sweatshirt with chunker print on the
side a little hesitant to get this
because you guys know my style is in a
little bit more earthy a little bit more
classic but this is more
like that trendy hipster it's literally
just a white sweatshirt and I'm trying
to make it sound like it's more than it
is but it's not it the next hop from
boohoo is really cute because it's
literally just a black crewneck with
some white stripes on the side of one of
the sleeves and I'm just so obsessed
with this because it's just so plain and
you know me like this is just me I would
so wear this to work out in because
lately I've been loving wearing long
sleeve tees to work out and because it's
obviously it's obviously colder outside
but also because I just feel like a
little bit more comfortable I like to be
a little bit more conservative when I go
to the gym like I know on Instagram a
lot of models where they're leggings and
their sports rods but 10 out of 10 of no
9 out of 10 of those girls in real life
actually wear tops to the gym and they
just don't show out on their Instagram
or on the YouTube videos because you
don't really want that attention
especially when you go to a gym they're
just like creepy guys it's like my
apartment gym like I don't want my front
desk people see me in a Sports Bra 8
a.m. long story short I've been looking
for some long sleeve workout tops and
this one is actually like really nice
because it's like the perfect material
for what I was looking for the last two
things that I'll show you from boohoo is
one this top that I got because it was
literally like six or seven dollars it's
literally just a white off the shoulder
top but I realized I didn't have a
long-sleeve one I only had a short
sleeve one and I for seven dollars like
why not and I also have the same top in
a grey and it has kind of like a stripe
pattern to it just by the material super
simple but I thought that I would get a
lot of wear out of it so the next bunch
of things I'm going to show you is gonna
be from Amazon I really wanted to try
out some of the Amazon like Fitness wear
because I've heard a lot about it and I
was looking for something a little bit
more inexpensive and you guys don't know
if you follow me places like Twitter
that I always talk about how I'm always
so annoyed with fitness clothing and
their prices because they're really
cheap and really bad quality or it's
really expensive and really good quality
but really expensive there's no middle
ground the only brand that I can
recommend so far is Jim shark because
their lagoons are like 30 to 60 dollars
and they're perfect quality but we're
gonna try out some of the Amazon stuff
right now because I realize that Amazon
actually sells Nike and Adidas and if
Amazon doesn't have good fitness
clothing then we're all lost for hope
there's ever gonna be a brand that will
have good fins clothing so I got three
sports bras from amaz
and all three of them are by champion
you guys know champions like a Walmart
brand that was started off as like three
dollars and now it's a little I can
eighty dollars Urban Outfitters brands I
don't want to model my glow up after
champion because that is that is the
conic so the first one I'm going to show
you is plain black because I thought
that you couldn't go wrong with that and
it is a seamless sports bra if you can't
tell I love seamless and it's racerback
in the back I also got the same one and
this light kind of like do much a camel
print which I was in love with also
because it's just kind of fun and it's
still really like looking and then I
have this same sports brought in gray
already which is why I bought it in the
pink it the color is a little annoying
in person I wasn't expecting it to be
this vibrant this one's really really
soft and really comfortable it's really
stretchy too and it has padding on this
inside that it can be removable which is
so good because sometimes sometimes you
need the padding so I also want to try
out two pairs of leggings I only wear
high waisted leggings to the gym I don't
like anything else because I'd like to
feel nice and snatched when I'm doing my
workout so the first pair that I got is
from their brands 90-degrees by reflex I
heard a lot about this man people that
shop on Amazon for their fitness
clothing I think that they try and mock
the same like appeal of Lululemon like
they have the exact same like style like
appearance-wise
but the material just does not compare
the material is really good for the
price if you needed something like I
would rather buy this then like forever
21 but I don't think it's great
this next pair I couldn't be more
disappointed and the color is just so
ugly it's basically like this a really
weird combination of blue and green I
think it looks really blue on camera but
in person and as a thing on line it
looked like it was a really pretty blue
but in person it's literally the
weirdest color the material is so thin
and so frail I feel like when you put
them on your life oh okay but then the
second you go to do something if I were
squatting them I feel like they would
just rip or something
thing from Amazon but I'm gonna show you
I couldn't be more excited about there's
one flaw with it but we'll get into that
in a minute so I finally got a champion
set from Amazon because you guys know
I've talked about this before but you
can get champion sets off Amazon for
literally half the price then Urban
Outfitters so this is the color of it
and it's literally the softest material
ever it's the men's collection which
doesn't really matter to me like tell me
one reason why I can't buy the men's
collection Ionis I think it's more like
a unisex but they call it the men's
collection online so soft
I literally wore it to class last night
after trying it on for the first time I
was like oh this is perfect I'm not
taking it off I'm just gonna wear class
and then I got what I thought was gonna
be the matching sweat pants joggers to
go with it as a set but the two colors
are ever so slightly different they're
very similar but they're just off which
is really annoying because like why
would Amazon advertise them as both navy
blue but then they're not the same and
the last couple things I'm going to show
you are super random but the first is
gonna be a new pair of Lululemon's that
I got and these are I think they're not
the Alliance I'll I'll link them below
because I camera what they're called but
they're a lot like the Alliance they're
high-waisted they're long and they're
like a dreamy grey blue and I love them
I actually wear these in the thumbnail
of my last video I think if these are
such a great gift a score for the
holidays if you want something that's it
a little like more expensive these will
last you for so long next I went to Free
People and I picked up a new pair of
jeans I love jeans that are a washed
black they're an off black they're not
grey but they're not black they're in
the middle and they're a little bit
destroyed so the story behind these is
that I ate Chipotle and I was a little
bit bloated when I tried them on so they
fit me perfectly but now that I'm not
well actually I just ate a potato so I
might be a little bit bloated so they
may fit me right now but now that I'm
not they don't really fit me anymore so
I might actually just return these
because if they were high-waisted it
would be fine but they're kind of mid
rise so they leave a gap in between my
waist and the jeans which is such a big
pet peeve of mine but if you guys want
to check them out I think the wash of
them is really good and three people
makes really soft denim which I love oh
my god you guys I found this scrunchie
at for you people and I know it's just a
scrunchie and I know that
you guys are probably like but this is
me and a scrunchie it's just it's just
it's great make sure you comment down
below what your favorite item was that I
showed you today so that I can get some
of your feedback I love hearing from you
guys and what your styling tips are
maybe follow me on my Instagram and my
Twitter and my snapchat if you aren't
already to keep up with more of my life
if you want to if not I understand
because I am kind of annoying like I get
it I understand I'm going to go and eat
another potato and go to class and I
hope that you enjoy the rest of your day
I really feel like I'm forgetting
something
