my channel today I'm gonna be walking
you through a productive night in my
life during the winter time right when I
got home today I was feeling so hungry
and I wanted to make something a little
bit sweet so I made a milkshake using
this banana and then I added some halo
top vegan peanut butter flavor is so so
good if you've never tried it definitely
go and try it
I like the vegan flavors I've never had
the regular flavors but nobody else
likes the regular flavors so I just put
that into a blender obviously and I made
a little smoothie I did some coconut
chips on top and then some raspberries
and it was a really good end to my night
and so then I just watched some YouTube
videos caught up on social media just
relax in my bed for a little bit and I
was watching this girl for so long her
name is Emma Chamberlain and I just
found her that day and she's so funny
definitely my new favorite youtuber and
then I decided to put my pajamas on so
I'm putting these brandy melville shorts
and just a champion sweatshirt pretty
much a go-to for me I love my champion
stretchers it's everything and then of
course we're also addicted to my phone
so I was just on my phone and on my
laptop multitasking you know I was
honestly answering DMS mentions emails
everything and then I just recently got
this new planner from Anthropologie and
I'm so in love with it it's called the
happiness planner and this is literally
only my second day using it but why I
love it is because you get to write down
your meals you journal what you did for
exercise that day you just write down
like your notes things that you have to
do it's really really great so at the
end of the day I was just going back and
writing down things that happened that
day things that I'm grateful for and I
just find it kind of helpful to reflect
on your day it takes literally two
seconds to do and you just kind of feel
good about it afterwards you feel really
productive and then I was writing down
what I'm doing the next day that way I
kind of mentally prepped myself and get
in the mood to know what I'm doing when
I wake up in the morning after I'm done
with my happiness planner I just
put that away into the next morning
where I'll open it back up and then I'm
going to write in my journal for the
night I just bought this journal also at
anthropology and I really wanted a new
journals reading my old one for so long
so I wanted something new to start 2018
with and these are some journal ideas if
you don't know what to write in a
journal
I obviously there's a lot of other ideas
out there but this is just but I could
come up with in the moment and I just
really enjoy writing in a journal and I
recommend you give it a tribe's
and then I recently started using an
essential oil diffuser rather than a
candle because I just like the way it
makes me feel it's so relaxing so I keep
a water bottle by my bed and I put water
in it when I'm about to use it and then
I'm gonna use a little bit of lavender
for sleep and relaxation and then this
other one that I'd really don't know
what it is but my roommate gave it to me
some sick and so she said it would help
the night before I accidentally dumped
so much in so that's why I'm dumping it
so slowly I mean it was really tragic
and I definitely don't recommend putting
more than like two drops of something in
but then I turn it on and it's so
alloxan this essential oil diffuser is
from sage one of my favorite essential
oil brands and I know what you guys are
thinking you're probably saying babe you
don't actually read at nighttime you're
just doing this for the video but no you
guys I'm so sick of my brain feeling
like mush after spending 20 hours on
social media all day so I've decided to
start reading every night and this is
the book trust by Osho so far I like it
I don't love it but comment down below
if you have any other books by him that
you want me to check out I highlighted
some passages and you guys can all be
screenshot these and read them but I
really enjoy highlighting while I read
and then going back and just kind of
remembering what I found was important
in the book that way I don't like forget
everything if you highlight it it's
easier to go back and see it and then
pretty much every night I make time to
listen to music and find new music I'm
obsessed with adding stuff to my Spotify
playlist right now I'm literally only
listening to Frank ocean I'm addicted
it's his older album too and I don't
know why but I can't stop listening to
it but if you just go onto Spotify and
you go into like new releases or just to
your browse I just basically listen to
like the first 10 seconds of a bunch of
songs and then if I like the first 10
seconds I'll add it to a playlist so
right now I'm using the playlist
December favorites and then January
workouts so I obviously new make a
January favorites but
if you want to follow me on Spotify you
can go for it I will link down below my
Spotify just so that we can all enjoy
music together definitely if you're part
of an a is listening and finding me
music and then it's time to take off my
makeup which oh my god this takes so
long to do I literally hate putting on
makeup before this reason takes me
literally three minutes to wipe off all
of my makeup with the micellar water you
could obviously do this a lot quicker if
you washed your face but oh my god we
are just way too lazy for that
and then I'm using a travel-sized I
don't know what this is the brand is
like formula 10 I don't know
and I thought does that Ulta basically
but I got it when I was home and I
really liked it and I usually kind of
firm my acne and I just put that on the
same way you put like a toner on and it
feels really good because I feel like it
really cleanses my pores really well and
then I'm gonna put this castor oil on my
eyebrows because that's kind of what
conditions them and helps them to grow
you can put it on your eyelashes too but
I didn't want to because I just didn't
want to and then I'm gonna use this
serum from heir bond that I stole from
my mom when I was home because I'm
indecisive and I can't take any
moisturizer for dry skin so if you have
any please comment them down below I am
so desperate for any moisturizer right
now and then this is my new trick for
preserving my hair at nighttime I just
tuck it into the back of a hoodie and
then I put the hood on and then when I
wake up in the morning my hair is still
like nice and curled and it isn't a
rat's nest like it usually is so if
you've never tried that give it a try
and then I was just drinking the rest of
my liter of water for the night and then
I was taking a cycle because it is cold
and flu season and I'm actually really
sick while recording this right now and
while making this video and I need to
get healthy again so as I came as my
go-to and I would be lying if I said I
didn't lay on my phone at night for a
little bit longer before going to bed
but after everything is kind of checked
off for the night it is time firstly
goodnight guys thank you so much for
watching and I will see you next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
