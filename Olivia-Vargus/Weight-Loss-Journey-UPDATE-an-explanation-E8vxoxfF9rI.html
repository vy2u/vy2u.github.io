to my channel this is already such a
weird video for me I'm sitting in the
most random corner of ever impossible
I'm wearing Justin Bieber t-shirt it's
like 12 o'clock in the afternoon and I
have class in 3 hours but I've been
wanting to film this video all week and
I just feel like I need to get it off my
chest and like do my rant that I like to
do so that way I can move on with my
life because it's just like uh it's like
just so heavy on my mind so I want to
start off by saying hey welcome back to
my channel if you're new here my name's
Liv I make new videos every Monday and
Friday you can subscribe to my channel
follow me on all my social media and I
feel gross saying all that right now
like this video is like not a normal
video but a lot of you a lot of people
my most watched video on my channel is
my weight loss journey and I haven't
done an update since then and a lot has
happened in a few months since I've made
that video so I'm gonna make this um
hopefully not as Randy as I can but it's
gonna be Randy and it's gonna be all
over the place cuz you don't mean like
if you click on this video and expected
anything other than like me going on ten
different tangents and having absolutely
no clear direction on any of them then
like I don't know what I'm even saying
right now but like basically this is
just the tone of the video it's gonna be
like this okay so this video is not
gonna be like about how I lost weight
it's not what the screaming about this
is gonna be about like what what's
happening my life right now
so peace on my last video I think that
was like a month and a half ago and that
was before I like when travelling across
the country for like a month like I was
still on summer break so my life didn't
have routine for a while and that is so
frustrating for me because I'm such a
routine person and it was kind of like
the end of this summer now and so I find
me as right now I feel like I have a
little bit of a grasp on life but school
is now starting which is weird I know
everybody's already back in school
starting for me this week and realizing
that this week has been really difficult
because it's like all of a sudden all of
this calm like energy that I've had just
got like tossed in the air and I'm like
oh my god I'm gonna have such a crazy
busy life again I've been crazy busy
this summer and so to cope with the fact
that now it's gonna just continue on and
an even greater speed it's just it's a
lot and it's just been kind of like
stressful but um relating that back to
like my weight loss journey and
everything working out has been really
difficult lately because I haven't felt
like it's my priority I feel like my
priorities lie in so many different
buckets right now that working out
hasn't been as enjoyable I haven't been
wanting to go to the gym and for that
reason like I've been having like just
kind of like these mixed like
rollercoaster motions of days where I
wake up and I'm like hell yeah girl and
then there's some days where I wake up
and I'm like I'm wearing a big sweater
and no one's gonna look at me and then
that as a result is so bad for me
because then I make myself work out out
of fear I know it's not a productive way
of thinking out of fear it doesn't help
me in any single way because when I wake
up in the morning and I have I feel like
I have to go to the gym otherwise like
I'm gonna be I'm gonna have a negative
day that instills negativity into my
mind already it's like why would I ever
want to go to the gym because I feel
like I'm forcing myself to like I came
to this Epiphany that I'm like I started
going to the gym because I had this
realization that I wanted to feel
stronger I wanted to feel in control of
who I am in my body and my mind my soul
and just everything about my life I
wanted to feel in control and I wanted
to get better at something and get
healthier and so that's like going to
the gym out of fear is like the opposite
of that
it's instilling negativity into my life
yeah it's just been a struggle bus and a
half trying to figure out how to manage
everything at once and that's just life
time management is a real adult term
that adults love you think and putting
in your face and I'm like stop all that
went to somebody's I'm doing is eating
sandwiches and watching YouTube and just
chilling and just being a sloth everyone
please leave me alone but you have to be
until sometimes you have to go through
things just to come out better I just
felt like I haven't had time for fitness
and then when I do have time I'm so
exhausted and I don't want to go work
out and that's the opposite of what I
want my life to be I say this a lot and
I'm gonna keep saying it because I need
to keep remind you guys cuz I forget it
sometimes it slips my mind but
everything in life is an opportunity to
become stronger everything your life is
an opportunity that you go through to
become stronger and become better so
anytime you go do something negative or
you make a mistake you fail at something
you take a step back it's an opportunity
to become stronger okay
I've just been asking myself lately like
is this making me happy like and when I
go work out like am i doing it because I
want to or because I feel like I have to
and I used to want to and it's because
and I came to this realization too it's
because I had a goal and I was talking
about this in my damns with someone the
other day that I feel like I have like
we all like have like fall fever because
I've been hearing this from so many of
you guys too we're like we're like we
don't really have like any motivation to
go work out anymore we don't have time
and I'm like I think it's fall fever
because we all like before summer like
we have these like goals and these
intentions and me manifest like health
and it's like all over the place in the
summer it's like just feeling good and
looking good and then like when we get
to the fall I feel like we all kind of
hit this road when we're like okay
what's not as important anymore we've
school now we have things going on and
nobody's like nobody really cares
anymore and so I realized like we have
like fall fever and I'm just not
manifesting anything right now I'm not
working towards anything right now and
for that reason I'm like not super
motivated or super excited to go and do
something because I'm like well what
what am i working towards and so that's
kind of been an issue for me too and so
I'll talk about that later I got in the
video what I've done to cope with that
but and also like it's okay to have a
lot going on it's okay to be busy with a
lot of different things and like
progressing your future and your career
and things like that it's okay for
different things to be manifested and
prioritized at once you can put your
fitness journey on hold if you want to
pursue something else right now and you
feel that you need to put time and
energy
to that instead of Fitness it's it's all
about a choice of what's gonna make you
happy you don't have cuz like for a
while I was like I have so much in so
many different buckets in my brain and
she's to overwhelm me and I feel like I
can't give my all to any of these and
really I can't go as far as I want to
and all of these at once because there's
too much going on so it's okay to be
like you know what I'm gonna put this
aside I'm gonna put this aside we're
gonna hold off on this it's okay and you
can always like you have as much time in
the world as you need like do not think
of time as an obstacle
don't just it's gonna move it's gonna
ruin your life just think about it it's
like what am I gonna do today like right
now what what do I want today today I
want to film a video I want to have a
really good lunch I want to go to class
and then I want to workout later and
then I want to spend tonight editing my
video that's my name that's what I want
to do it's what I'm gonna do tonight
that is how I prioritize my day so don't
worry if you have too much going on for
fitness
don't let it really affect you that much
because what's meant to be will be and
what you put your energy into will
create it so so don't put your energy
into negativity you put it into
self-love so the last minute we'll talk
about before I talk about the epiphanies
that I've had weight loss PTSD and I
could be making this up I don't think
this is like a self diagnosis thing but
this is something that I have recently
been like oh my god like it's just
hitting me hard so uh and I've had so
many of the people tell me about this -
so basically I'm not saying that I hate
who I was a year ago I have come such a
far away mentally and physically since a
year ago when I was at my worst point
and being where I am now I'm a lot more
confident and comfortable in my body
because I've worked so hard to get it to
be strong I and to just feel internally
happy about it and so so when I have
those days where I'm like feeling down
or feeling negative about my body or I
didn't make it to gym I experienced like
more anxiety than I should because it
takes so much effort to lose weight and
it's so easy to gain weight that I get
this I get this instant fear when I look
in the mirror and I see that I've gone
in a backwards direction it's really
hard for me because I worked so hard to
get to the point to where I am and so to
even take a look a small step back
it like literally paralyzes me with this
fear of like oh my god I can't go
backwards like I can only go forward I
can only go forward and that's like you
know that's what it means that I've had
that it's like this is like honey like
you aren't gonna always have good days
you aren't always gonna be on your
a-game like some days are gonna wake up
and they're not gonna be great
some days you're gonna wake up and you
gained a pound because girl you ate
those french fries you know you did you
know you did so coming to the
realization that life is about you know
ups and downs and you can't avoid paint
you can't avoid having bad days it is
inevitable but what you can do is you
can get better coping with them you can
get better at being positive and
choosing to get better because like I
said I'm not perfect like I'm still
struggling with everything to instead of
like sitting there and being like well
screw it I'm not gonna go to the gym
it's pointless
I don't want to work out I'm scared too
it's gonna have to work out ten times
longer ten times hard and I don't want
to like I don't want to do that it
sounds so undesirable to me instead of
that I say to myself yo Joe
you're floating on a rock in space it's
really okay it's really okay what
matters the most to me is that I enjoy
health is that I enjoy my life and so in
order to do that I have to do workouts
that I enjoy I don't I was so caught up
for a while and things like oh my god I
have to like work out my glutes to like
get rid of my hip dips that I'm
genetically like born with and I was
like oh my god like I have to get a flat
stomach like I had to do these eye
workouts and I should start running and
I should start doing this not and then I
just stopped enjoying my workouts
because I was like I felt like I had to
do all these things and I was like can I
just like work like can I just work out
like can't I just like feel like oh I
want to go in like I'm really in the
mood to like work out my legs today I'm
gonna do like five reps of like really
intense squats because it just feels
good right now and I want to go strong
and I want to feel like I want to get my
endurance up today like I want to run
today or one of these that's like why
don't I just listen to my body more
instead of listening to like these crazy
mental thoughts that I have that are
like you have to get rid of your hip
this otherwise you're never gonna be
happy or satisfied with your life like
that's so stupid
that's so stupid so just doing workouts
that I actually enjoy doing and things
that make me want to go to the gym
it's a 10-minute workout and I'm like yo
um I'm good I'm good for that I'm gonna
come out of here like I've got other
things to do I need to go like just
being intuitive because it's not about
what you look like it's about what you
feel like at the end of the day so at
the end of the day who cares that you
look like your ideal body type what I
want to know is are you happy have you
been happy with the process has the
entire thing been like have you learned
from it like I don't want to force
myself into these negative habits and
into these negative routines that I
don't enjoy doing just because I feel
like it's gonna make me happy in the
long run because I'm gonna reach some
sort of goal that I set for myself
that's probably unattainable to my own
genetic body type I want to just be
happy with the process so what is this
video this rant it's like so in GAD like
I just want to focus on being strong and
I want to focus on feeling good I don't
want to feel guilty or feel like
negative about my weight loss journey
because I'm like oh my god like I have
to be a certain way and look a certain
way like this is body and mind you guys
like this isn't just about what your
body feels like and looks like and how
healthy your body is but it's about how
healthy your mind is and that means like
having a positive mindset like it means
having a mind that is healthy in all
aspects and it's a two-force thing you
have to put as much energy and love into
both things and manifest both things at
the same time this is all just life like
we're all just learning and we have to
accept that there's gonna be days that
are bad and there's gonna be moments
that are bad and there's gonna be days
there's I mean weeks where we skip the
gym and there's gonna be weeks where we
eat out for every meal and things just
hit the fan sometimes but what matters
isn't the bad days it's not the bad
moments because we all make mistakes and
it's all just about learning what
matters is how we cope with it and how
we take that and when you're like how am
I gonna avoid this again or how and it
sucks cuz sometimes you know you have
like a bad day and happened like 10
times and you you feel like oh like I
think breaking your arm so you break
your arm 10 times and you're like what's
the point of healing it's just gonna
break itself again it's just gonna
happen again what's the
even getting better that's the worst
mindset because like what matters isn't
that it's gonna happen again because it
likely will
what matters is that you get better at
coping with it and so that brings me to
my last point of this video I don't want
to talk about which is manifestation and
I talk about this all the time and if
you don't do this already I really
recommend that you sit down and write a
list of things you want to manifest even
just for the month and I did this last
night I did it in September I did it
over the span of the summer but now I'm
doing it month to month just cuz I don't
know what's going on in life right now
so the periods are shorter write down
the manifestation list of things that
you want to see happen things that you
want to change about life or you want to
focus on that month and not what you
have a goal you have these things that
you can look at every day on your your
lock screen on your phone tape it up on
your mirror that you get ready at
morning
put it in your journal at the front page
so you see every time you open it put it
somewhere and for your manifestation
list you can include things like working
out and you can include things like meal
prepping you can also include things
like I want to get better at I want to
get better at choosing a positive path
so in life you're always given the
choice to be like I'm gonna look at this
negatively or a little to this
positively if so view manifest
choosing positivity for the month of
October every time you put into a bad
situation where you're like looking at
your thighs like I am right now and
you're like oh my god I gained weight my
thighs like I can't believe this I
worked so hard to make them the way that
I want to go to I just took a step
backwards instead of like going down
that path of negativity that leads to
absolutely nowhere and makes you
literally nowhere near your goals and a
happier person looking at them and being
like okay like I see that maybe like
I've been a little like slavish lately
and like I can do better like I can do
better and I want to do better and I'm
going to that's what I want you guys to
do that's what I want to hear from you
guys this was kind of it this was kind
of the video I'm so sorry if this video
was triggering it all because I hate
putting weight loss in my title for me
it's triggering and I don't want to I
don't want to be in that industry like I
want to be in the industry of self-love
so I'm thank you so much for listening
to my rant today I hope that in some way
helped you it kind of connected with you
I don't know I don't know if you guys
what you were expecting when you watch
this video if you were expecting me to
be like hey guys it's like super sweet
couple video because that's who I am
like I'm really positive like I'm really
like but some days like this I get on
these like power like things and I'm
like didn't I can't get open and it's
not like me being like monotone and
negative like I'm just like out-of-body
experience like just saying whatever is
like running through my mind and so
thank you so much for watching this
video I I just hope that this video is
like positive like I hope that this
video was like mature and like I wasn't
like I know that I was rambling in this
video but I hope that it wasn't too
confusing and I hope that it wasn't too
like I don't know I just hope this video
was like I hope who do you guys please
talk to me fill up some of your thoughts
DM me on Instagram Twitter too any time
you want to I do my best to reach into
all of the DMS and everything and like
talk to you guys because that's like the
most important thing in the world to me
is like helping you guys like and just
like I want to share my struggles not to
like cover up like the fact that I don't
want to cover up like my insecurities
and being like oh like you guys I'm fine
I'm fine I'm fine like be positive like
I think it's more helpful to be
relatable talking to you guys always
helps me so much and I hope that when I
talk to you guys it can help you a
little bit to in a positive way and
