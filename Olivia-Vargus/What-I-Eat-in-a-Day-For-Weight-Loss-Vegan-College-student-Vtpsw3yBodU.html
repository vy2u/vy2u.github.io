to my channel I was waiting on you and
not me
hello everybody and welcome back to my
channel and if you're new to my channel
welcome
feel free subscribe join our family it's
a good time so this week I'm going to be
doing a wedding in a day videos you guys
love these videos I've been to one in a
while today just going to be a very
interesting how to do what else you
expect from me but let's get into it
this is what I eat in a day really
physically Missouri where's the net I
have every morning is I started running
with a cup of coffee and I have my soy
milk creamer that I put into this I find
it better you just get it smells Libra
done was like end of craving and like
shimmer later on so next I'm going to be
using my nutribullet I love this thing
so easy to use the lean disease and I'm
going to be making something that's one
of my favorites right now and we sweet
banana pancake so you put one banana in
a blender and then you add a half a cup
of just regular coke and then after that
you're going to add three and a half
tablespoons of all my mouth split off
whatever you want to add into it and it
gets literally all these obviously out
of like and there's anything else that
you want to PS you like some tea little
bit a bunch of other things into this
but this is the time you this morning
and it's like it was so so quickly
do not yeah exactly and the venue's
little pop in and it'll wake about four
or five little ones I'm a completely
size because I've always because so
quickly and I don't how many do it this
is banana
but it would be like silver toppings I
Alice's peanut butter with Fox and TNCs
from Trader Joe's stuff is really good
and nothing else added to it and very
low in sodium and yes it seems kind of
pull the camera also put peanut butter
on one of my seasoning Caitlyn for my
steak oh my mom so funny
so that's that we're topping about
Wednesday Wilson is peanut butter and
yes my family recipes
so it's so feeling if you have me on
snapchat and know that I eat this
literally every morning so basically
what I mean here is that I just added
some Brussels sprouts some tofu starlet
30 touchless preferred and then some
hash browns because I did that right and
in handle effects in a minute the pretty
weird combination and under CC cream
good and evil peanut sauce with me to of
a little bit of your options water and I
just added that together and it was look
ahead for pretty weird watching fun I am
the kind of like Mia and only really
feel like maybe we can take you this is
going to limp and is really good
protein and as some sort of comedy
within like potatoes and leggings and a
lot of different dishes with it so yeah
that's Marie but what I want you to take
that so for a snack I had about half of
water now ain't the time what you're
seeing here is a shot and got a native
on board and then I can also limit the
amount of butter I'm eating in a day
goodbye anyway too much
so kind of only has one serving a day so
that's two tablespoons oh and in my
brain I'm like okay why I was infected
I had pv2 is lunch which doesn't
technically to help in my world because
it's like peanut butter flour so it's
not to say about such a piece of so
I suppose peanut butter on toast because
I was running late and I need something
really quick and I really didn't like
I'm use made for making bread that's not
in - like sourdough I don't buy
sourdough I don't even like to buy bread
and if I do I get an equal breath but
like I said I was running late so I
system over AIDS on top of that and it's
pretty good it's a quick skilling thing
to eat so yeah if you want to try that
out go for it and then I went to work
and after work when I came home I had an
apple because I was so tired and I
didn't feel like eating another meal so
I just come to bed and we are the next
morning so hello I hope you guys enjoyed
