a good time for you subscribe enjoy my
family what do I hear things to do on
this channel
it's shiny music so today I'm gonna be
sharing with you my January playlist
this playlist is really by V it's got
some new stuff but it's also got a few
throwbacks that I really really like
right now so I'm really excited to share
this with you as always make sure you
comment down below any other songs that
you I'm going to check out and maybe add
to this playlist I'm always like free
new music as you just saw my night
routine I'm going to look for new music
like every single night if not a few
times throughout the day I'm just
looking for new music alright so I have
my pants on my phone my Spotify be
linked down below and I my Bose speaker
let's get because they
was never crying
by the way just because it's on my face
that does not mean that I know all the
words but if you say I didn't even know
a single lyrics to that one but we're
going with it
okay let's play something that we all
know that I know the lyrics up because I
love it to hear it something all time
like all time all the songs in the
worlds hi hello sorry but this one is
better than every other song ever in my
life um I'm just putting it here because
even though I've posted about it many
times it deserves the recognition
[Laughter]
I hope my future husband's okay with
that somehow being our wedding song like
it doesn't really seem like a wedding
song but I'm gonna make it work moving
on to more like good bye me songs I've
been loving in song I was thinking this
in the trunk know when it first came out
and it made me like cry on the treadmill
now that doesn't mean me cry anymore but
it's definitely a vibe
I don't know where I've been hurt but
I've never been happy so much before I
feel I didn't know that I could get this
this next song I also just put on my
snapchat story when I came back to LA
because it's a little street in la Santa
Monica labret my black bear the
intersection of Santa Monica and the
Bray in LA is where my favorite target
is and I go there all the time and I'm
always talking about it but it's just if
I could build a house on top of that
target and live there I would do it
because I love it there
so that's literally in the intersection
so that's why I like this song otherwise
I didn't really like anything else on
Black Bears album unpopular opinion
sorry
what if we never met wondering if I next
armistice
dear
okay more throwbacks you guys I've been
listening to Frank ocean's album blondes
on repeat I don't know why but I can't
stop listen to to know a few of the
songs but specifically these two songs
they also like make me cry sack tumble a
bunch of some last night could I make a
shag last night
how can you not cry to die
did you
I've been really into this remix of
waterfall by petit biscuit everyone
really knows its own money but there's
an entire album that petite that's
getting it up there remixes and this one
was my favorite
I'm definitely still learning this song
but it's been such a good workout song
this next time I just downloaded last
night and I've only listened to it once
and it was like one of those subtly cute
songs but we're not sure yet
ya know it's definitely cute I think
that's gonna be a good I think that's
gonna come it turns really fast okay
could it make this video without
including rich Brian's new song I love
him a lot I would marry him you know so
much but yeah
