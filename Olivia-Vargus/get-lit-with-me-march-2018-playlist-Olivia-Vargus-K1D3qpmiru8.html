to my channel if you do your my name is
Liv I make new videos every Monday and
Friday it's a good time Tim will be
doing my spring theme I put this tastes
like March / spring
whichever one you prefer they're all my
hair it's alright now I make these
playlists pretty often not every month
but pretty much every other month so if
you like these types of videos and you
aren't subscribed feel free to subscribe
and care my poster of H dawn because
YouTube is like really messed up right
now and no one's getting any
notifications of my videos as always I
will have my Spotify playlist linked in
the description and I'll try and put the
name of all the songs on the screen or
if I don't do that then just go to this
way like this and as always make sure
you comment down below what your
favorite song is right now if I didn't
put it in this video so that I can add
it to the playlist and also just a
disclaimer I have really cringey dance
moves and we're just gonna own it and
accept it so without further ado let's
get right into our boyhood
I can RT like oh my god I already feel
the cringe dance moves just oh it's too
much too much I'm so sorry
this song is my favorite song right now
and it's not one of your artists this is
the song that I just put on my Instagram
stories while I was wearing like all the
moon and star themed jewelry and like my
sweatshirt and everything so if you're
wondering this is all oh oh this is my
 hey this is my
that's where artists bradley's tell me
when they play my
I feel kind of basic for putting this
next song on here but it isn't my marsh
palest and it is a good song and it's
still a new song but like lord knows
we've all listened to this song ten
million times so it feels like it's
always just existed in our lives but
this is like a brand new song she said
do you love me I tell only partly I only
let my mom down at geoguessr guys half
of this video I never told you guys I
move my room around you might be
wondering why there's just only three
cacti in the corner over here so he's my
beds against the wall over here and it's
just one service mission to help me my
first name is Justin I'm doing order
bezel we get ceiling
because I call tomorrow Michael can't
really trust nobody with all his Jewish
mom it bothers me how often I don't know
the lyrics to songs that I listen to on
the daily I should know all those words
but I just I just don't
okay this next song I ended up taking a
dance class with Justine Skye in summer
she you invited me and it was for Puma
woman and we basically learned her like
choreography to this song I learned that
day that I loved hip-hop dancing but I'm
so bad at it and we are weirding it I
didn't you learn anything like
in Macau yeah
you know we really tried we gave it our
all there's no need to relive that okay
so recently I've been listening to a lot
of memories written you know your girl
doesn't autosave name but basically his
music is kind of old but I've been
listening to it recently because it has
this really tropical summery vibe and
even though it's like not even spring
yet it's just nice okay so his music is
really really like inappropriate like
it's very sexual so if you're young and
you shouldn't be listening to this stuff
then just cover your ears and skip past
these okay so when did just do a little
compilation of all his good songs right
now
bitch Belgian child and I was
tryna get my car so I approached
I never thought I miss somebody
ha
only the law you know
we just say I really love vacation right
now I laugh while I guess because I just
sense the cringe and I like I'm laughing
at myself so I found this song today do
you know that me to move man I did not
know the song Jesus said I don't know if
you know that this song exists but if
you don't I think that this song
deserves to be blown up it's by someone
named Fletcher who I've never heard of
it's called I believe you and if you
listen to the whole song would probably
cry I did I was damn it I cried I cried
did you move along to be honest
yeah I really have goosebumps that song
the song is written beautifully and sang
beautifully and just done so well keep
it with sad songs let's listen to this
one which I just found today also and I
really love asking them are homeless for
promised a chance to
come closer
why am i listening to sad songs right
now I'm getting so sad honestly you guys
there's so many more songs on this place
if you want to go check it out and
follow it I have like an hour of footage
right now so I think I'm gonna end the
video here if you like this video please
give it a thumbs up I love you guys so
much thank you for watching and don't
forget I'm going to London next week and
I cannot wait to make all the travel
vlogs and just obviously hang out with
