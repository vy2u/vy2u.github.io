every Monday Friday it's a good time for
you subscribe and join our family
today's video is gonna be all about
organization since it is the new year I
can get in time to get everything
together that we can start off the year
on the right but this was definitely one
of my new year's resolutions I needed to
indeed collect her in my life and yet
just and specifically we're going to be
talking about closet organization
because oh my god do I really need to
organize my closet and then since I'm
gonna be getting rid of a lot of my old
clothes now don't worry anymore feel
free to check out my closet on Poshmark
where you can shop everything that I am
getting rid of and buy from me today's
video is actually sponsored by Poshmark
so thank you guys so much for working
with me in this video I truly love your
app and I've been using it for so long I
think it's also one of the best ways to
motivate yourself to clean your closet
because you think oh well at least I
think I'll smoke this and make some
money off of it you know so if you never
made an account before it's really easy
you can sign up with your Facebook or
your email usual line on all things and
then it's so easy to use all you do is
take a picture of the clothing that you
are selling and you can take it right
from your phone it literally takes like
two seconds to do and then you get to
price it however you want to you give it
a description a subtitle and then you
share it and you wait for people to make
offers and then pockmark makes it so
easy to ship things because I was a
little bit challenged when I first had
to ship something I was like how does
this work I don't know never do this
before
but they literally make this shipping
label for you all you do is print it out
and then you just have to put it on the
side of the box which you can get a box
anywhere and they will even tell you
like what boxes to get because even
though I was like how do I get a box and
they were like this so you can talk
something and then you just drop it in
the mail box and it's so fast and it has
trapped shipping so you can see when the
person gets it and then they can let you
know and if they got the products and
then the payment goes out like right
away it's so fast it's the easiest and
quickest way to just
make some extra coin and it really if
you're not doing this already like it's
just so easy I don't see why not
and we all know there's stuff in our
closet that we don't wear now we can
sell so without further ado let's get
into the video and you can follow me on
Poshmark I will leave the links down
below and my username on the screen and
you can show up my closets so I'm pretty
lucky because most people in college
have a really small wardrobe but my
closet is actually pretty large it takes
up my entire wall I try to organize my
closet by length of sleeves and just by
season so in the first section of my
closet I have all of my tank tops and
crop tops and these are usually things
that I wear in summer or things that I'm
layering pieces with and then after that
I keep all of my short sleeve shirts and
long sleeve shirts and then after that I
keep all of my dresses all of my long or
more size shirts then on the next
section I keep my thicker long-sleeve
shirts and then I put all of my sweaters
and then after that I put all of my
sweatshirts which is a lot and then
lastly I put a few jackets and cardigans
throughout the past year everything has
just kind of gotten mixed and jumbled
together because I try to keep pretty
organized but we all know there's days
where you just can't be bothered to put
things back in the right place so it's
so easy for things to get messed up but
I do I should try and keep to this
system it's just the easiest one I'm
trying to find stuff if you want to
organize it by color or whatever
categories you want you absolutely go
for it but that's not what your girl
does because no we don't have time for
nominee I'm sorry
and that will honestly just trust me out
more if I just get more anal about it so
we just keep it simple so in order to
declutter it I basically go through and
I look at each piece one by one and if I
see that the piece is just way too worn
or it's just something that I'm not
gonna wear in the future or I can't see
myself you know putting on like that day
because I always say the most reasonable
way to tell if you like something is if
you would wear it that day you know so
if I don't see myself you know finding
any practical use for this in the near
future maybe I've over worn it maybe it
just it's just done it's time you know
r.i.p I respect the time you spent with
me but it is time to go then we just put
it in its a little pile and so we put it
off to the side and then as we're going
through the rap I make sure to take all
of the empty hangers off the rock - and
I put those aside because I just like
for my closet to be meat with no like
random hangers you know all which ways
so then after a little bit of time I
usually listen to music or I'm watching
YouTube videos and Netflix while I'm
doing this because it just keeps my mind
stimulated because sometimes this can be
a little bit boring so having something
in the background playing and you know
the stuff from Poshmark you just have
music the background playing and it's
honestly a pretty good time because I'm
Saturday night I don't know about you
girl but I'm getting my coins on polymer
that's what I'm gonna be doing okay no
but in all seriousness it is pretty easy
so the number one tip I have ourselves
some posh markets is making sure your
pictures are good so make sure that you
have pretty much a white background or
if you want to try it on in a mirror
that's also a really good idea I like
use my comforter and then I use my ring
light in order to light it up so that
people can actually see the clothing and
it take like four photos of the clothing
I like to take a photo of the front to
bed up on the back and then idea
close-ups and I almost always take a
photo of the actual label too that way
people can see you know the size the
brands and then I just post it with a
good title a good description and then
list the brands if you want to and put a
price on it whatever you find reasonable
and then list it and just wait for them
coins to come in girl so for example
today I'm gonna be selling a bunch of
old stuff that I just haven't worn in a
while and I don't feel expressed in the
mean that I want to be in 2018 anymore
you know what I mean you catch my feel
so many times writing mobile sweater
which I've just worn so many times and I
think it's time to pass on to the next
person it's truly been a really nice
comfortable winter sweater and I hope
the next person enjoys a tail and then
I'm going to be selling this Urban
Outfitters top which is just really cute
and really dainty and this one's cute as
it has these ties on it so it makes it a
little bit more unique I also have some
Camel pants that I'm going to sound
they're still in really good shape and
really good quality because I honestly
didn't really wear them that much I wore
the
lean and then I wore them like one other
time so they're kind of like the perfect
thing to sell and then I have a taught
from Zarrella which I bought last summer
so again it just makes me feel like it
makes me feel like it's the old me like
it's not the new me and I just I know
that sounds so cliche but it needs to be
said but for someone else
it might match exactly who they want to
be it might match exactly who they're
2018 is supposed to be but I do think
that it's easier for other people to see
value in your clothing than it is for
unity surrounding that something that
you've just been staring out non-stop
every day like looking past and you're
just never really gonna wear it again
and another top and only me selling
today is this really pretty girly talk
from fashion Nova and I honestly just I
wanted this to be my vibe it's so bad it
doesn't in 17 and I just couldn't make
it happen so we're just gonna move on
we're gonna move on their lives and I'm
fine with that as far as my closet once
I'm done getting rid of everything that
I don't feel like serves me anymore and
who I want to be I just go through and
make sure that everything is on its
hanger I make sure that everything that
I have left is going to give me joy it's
not then we just go through the process
again and I tell that and if you're
having trouble getting rid of something
you can't decide if you really want to
keep it or not always just ask yourself
would the highest version of myself wear
this I really hope that you guys liked
