to my channel if you're new here my name
is Liv I make new videos every Monday
and Friday it's a good time feel free to
subscribe and join our family a bit of a
disclaimer before I start the video I'm
actually at my home on Cape Cod right
now so this is my living room and I
filmed last video in my bedroom but my
bedroom is so messy right now and I just
couldn't I couldn't clean it like I'm
sure you guys understand I just really
could not be bothered so we're just
gonna go here to my dog so today we're
gonna be talking about my favorite topic
which is how to glow up I've made a
couple of these videos before but this
is gonna be 2008 teen version I've got
some really good tips and some good
manifestations so we're gonna start off
by talking about outer glow up tips and
then we're gonna talk about the inner
glow tips both of them very valuable now
before we get started we have a couple
rules to follow before we get into the
list the first rule is don't make any
intentions that you would not start
right now today immediately if you had
the chance because that's gonna be the
easiest way to figure out if your
intention or your goal is realistic so
make it something that you would
literally start today is the next rule
is that you have to understand a lot of
these are gonna be habits and habits
take about two weeks in order to become
your daily routine and just something
that you don't really have to think
about in order to do anymore so make
sure that you give yourself like the
appropriate time to create this habit
for some of these because it's okay if
you start out slow as long as you're
still doing it and you're creating the
habit and my last rule or just kind of
helpful tip before we get into the other
tips is maybe make a vision board of all
of your goals I did this and I put it on
my Twitter and it's my pin tweet if you
want to go and check it out if you want
to make your own please tweet it at me
so that I can see or make it your pin
sweet I know a lot of us are super
visual people and so just seeing it and
kind of getting the vibe and the
aesthetic from it it was just enough to
just really motivate me and just give me
an idea of what I want to achieve so our
first go up tips are going to be all
about outer appearances and things that
you can do on the outside that you kind
of make yourself glow up and change I
had the biggest glow up this year from
the beginning of the year to now buy it
I just don't even know where to begin
everything has changed obviously the
biggest thing that I did was change my
hair I think and so now I started the
year with short dark brown hair and
with long blonde hair we really did a
360 here but obviously I've said this
before changing your hair is going to
make you feel so so so different and
it's gonna literally make you look like
a whole new person so if you don't have
a lot of access to dye your hair or
cutting your hair a big thing that you
can really do is just switching up a
style I wore my hair straight every
single day in high school and a lot of
my life I've just always straightened it
and in 2017 I started curling it and I
really became obsessed with how my hair
looked when it was curled so trying out
new hairstyles and switching it up every
week so like every other day have a
different hairstyle
don't try and stick to the same thing
for too long and it's just hair so it's
one of the most harmless things that you
can change because it's literally so
easy to just straighten it the next day
just go back to normal if you didn't
like it or throw it up in a ponytail if
you didn't like the way that it came out
curled the next outer glow up tip that I
have is gonna be about fitness and so
obviously I talk about Fitness a lot on
my channel if you wanna make a fitness
goal I recommend that you don't make it
something about like your weight or
about your scale number like don't make
it about losing 10 pounds or having a
size 6 jeans make it something more
exciting and something that you can
actually chase after with like a
reasonable time frame so personally for
me for example my goal for 2018 is to
run a six-minute mile for some of you
you might be like that's so easy but
I've never been good at running I've
never been good at long-distance always
do some sort of uphill walking for
cardio so I really want to get good at
running and 2018 I 100% know I can do
that and if I can run a six-minute mile
that means I'm obviously in good shape
and I'll obviously be looking good so
there's no reason to make any sort of
other goals besides like fun things like
that if you like weight trading or if
you have some sort of sport or something
just setting some sort of like actual
goal that makes sense
to achieve that's just the better way to
go about it in my opinion because then
you're actually more accountable and
you're like okay like next week I'm
gonna try and hit eight minutes the next
week I'm gonna try and hit seven minutes
and 45 seconds my next blog tip is about
hygiene kind of so basically having a
signature scent is going to make you
feel so so good my signature scent is
light blue by Dolce &amp;amp; Gabbana because I
just find it to be the most like up
lifting and neutral but still like
really unique said I don't know everyone
loves like blue Michael it's Dolce and
Gabanna so check it out if you have
never smelled it before but having a
signature scent will always make you
feel really good and it makes you so
much more attractive to other people too
when people smell good think about all
the people that are maybe like but then
they smell good and you're like so
definitely find your signature scent
just go into Sephora
go into also go into Macy's and just
pick out one set and try and stick to
that and wear it everyday and it will
become your son the next box is that I
have it's her style I think a lot of us
will you spend a lot of money on fast
fashion pieces in 2017 and we have
nothing to show for it besides a bunch
of old worn-out crop tops and graphic
tops and jeans and things that really
were not a good investment but we did it
anyways in 2018 my goal is to invest in
more staple pieces things that are gonna
actually be in my closet for a long time
so for example the first thing that I
invested in was some new jewelry I want
to invest in more new purses if you need
a new wallet anything staple quality
pieces invest in and the last outer glow
of tip that I have is going to actually
kind of be a little strange but if you
want to restart your Instagram feed all
you have to do is basically like find a
new filter and I think that she doesn't
18 is just a good year for better
creativity new Instagram feeds make you
feel like a new person
I've been using the same filter for a
long time so I might start looking for a
new one soon but I just love Instagram
feeds I think that they're just so
there's such a great expression of your
creativity if so if you don't already
have one there's no harm in starting one
now and there's no harm in just getting
a little bit more creative and
expressing yourself a little bit
different on your Instagram it just
makes you feel put together it makes you
feel like you are unique and you have
your own aesthetic I also use the
Instagram save tool so often to save
feeds of other people that I like and
then I'll go back and try and figure out
what filter that they're using or I'll
try and figure out like you know how do
they set up their photos like do they
post a lot of selfies do they post a lot
of full bodies do they post a lot of
like Flatley pictures 3d pictures my
Instagram feed isn't great but if you
want to check it out and follow it go
for it
I'm gonna try and make it better in 2080
and obviously so now we're gonna talk
about in our goals my favorite topics
because on my channel this is like what
I'd completely completely talk about and
want to preach to people it's like inner
beauty inner self love inner
manifestations and goals we're gonna
talk about my favorite tips for 2018
right now so I first goal for 2018 is to
continue to do this habit that I've
gotten into where before I eat every
meal I asked myself does this serve me
and a lot of times like if it's really
high in carbs or if it's just kind of
like empty and calories or empty in
protein my body really actually responds
and I'll just know like my mind knows
that's crazy because we don't tap into
it enough but when you tap into it and
you like hold something up and you say
does this serve me you your body like
genuinely will say yes or no just give
it a try no know what I mean because I
sound like a weirdo trying to explain it
but it really really has helped me learn
more about like foods that I really
enjoy eating versus foods that I feel
like aren't really doing much for me the
next school it's a bit I think a lot of
us always try and make but it kind of
falls through because it's something
that we get lazy about but journaling is
something that I think that we can all
kind of try and incorporate into our
daily lives or at least weekly lives
if you can't journal every day or every
night like don't worry about it just do
it as much as you can and the reason
that I like journaling that I feel like
I need to do it more for it because
sometimes I go through a day and I'll
have a bad day and I think okay it's
fine I'll go to bed and I'll wake up and
I'll feel so much better or sometimes
that feeling lasts for way too long and
I never stop and think about it I'm just
like it's just my day it's just the
vibes today something what the energy
today it's just really bad and I'm not
really taking the time to dig deeper and
ask myself why but whenever I sit down
and write in a journal
I'll just all of a sudden be like oh
shoot like I have an epiphany I'm like
oh it's because like of this or it's
because of this or someone says
something to me yesterday and I didn't
think about it but I spend in the back
of my mind and I need to release like
face that and deal with it so writing is
just a really good way to empty your
mind it's kind of fun shooting because
it's definitely something to take a lot
of effort to go out of your way and do
every night or every morning so if you
can't write everyday or if you only want
to write like one sentence a day or one
day a week and just have an overall
weekly week recap just anything that
anything small I would just start doing
because it really makes the biggest
difference in your overall mood and your
overall just
and your experiences you really get to
kind of just I don't know you you got a
better sense of who you are through your
writing I think because you're just kind
of having like your own alone time so
the next thing that I really want to
achieve in order to blow up in 2018 is I
really want to find more friends that I
feel like are the type of friends that
are like soulmate friends I just really
want to make more connections with more
people in 2018 I don't know how to say
there's out insulting all my other
friends the next thing that is
completely necessary in order to blowing
up is asking yourself if the people that
you surround yourself with are genuinely
there and uplifting you or if they're
weighing you down and you can really
measure how your energy feels after you
hang out with people and your doesn't
eighteen we are not going to hang out
with people who make us feel like our
energy has been drained 2018 everyone
that you hang out with ask yourself
after you're done hanging out with them
like how do you feel do you feel good do
you feel like you're tired or you're
exhausted or that took a lot about out
of you
really focusing on how different people
in your life are really affecting you
and helping you if they're not helping
you glow get them out here so the first
thing that you need to do is you need to
remove all the toxic people in your life
and I know you guys have all the time
and you're probably like that's so
cliche and that's just it's not possible
because you think it's impossible to get
away from these people or they're just
in your friend group and you can't
escape them just distancing yourself
it's a lot easier than you think it is
like literally don't text them don't
snap as bottoms don't favor their tweets
you really are the five people that you
surround yourself with the most that's
who you become so surround yourself of
people who you would literally trade
places with who you want to see do their
best
only mutual relationships in 2018 do not
be friends with someone who isn't
putting in the same amount of effort as
you only be friends of people who you
really really really want to see do well
and who also support you in the same
equal effect because if you're giving so
much energy to someone and they're not
reciprocating it who are you their
friend or are you just like their fan
and probably one of the most essential
tips to blowing up is you need to leave
all of the old dead exes and just
crushes and anyone else in the past
block them on snapchat
delete their number unfollow them on
Twitter unfollow them on Instagram or
mute them if you can't do that
and just
move on just completely move on because
ask yourself how many times you're
posting things or you're doing things or
going places or hanging out with certain
people can you just try to get the
attention of someone I think that
there's nothing more freeing than just
being like you know what that
relationships it's not gonna work out
and I need to move on from it so just
allow yourself to be open the idea of
new meeting new people because a lot of
times we hold ourselves back because
we're still interested in this person
and we miss out on probably some good
people so just completely just releasing
that person from your life and just
being like I'm gonna move on I'm gonna
be open to meeting new people and just
new relationships in 2018 and that's
gonna be the best thing that you can do
for yourself because when you meet new
people they have the opportunity to
change you and help you grow when I look
back on 2017 I think about who I was
surrounded with at the beginning versus
who I'm surrounded with at the end and I
realized that a lot of the changes that
I made in my life had to do with the
people and so in 2018 let's make it
happen again let's try meet new amazing
people in 2018 and any year just feeling
like we're really surrounded by our soul
mates our soul sisters our soul brothers
if you have any tips that I did not
mention and you want to add please leave
them down below because I will go
through and heart all my favorite one so

New Year's Eve and a good start to your

much and I will see you in 2018 I'm not
