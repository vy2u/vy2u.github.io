making a video on how to go out for this
spring
I know these types of videos pretty much
every new season with my collective tips
and stuff that I've learned throughout
the past few months so if you like these
videos if you're free to subscribe and
join our family so blowing up is one of
my favorite terms of all times because
it basically just puts a positive
outlook on like I want to change and
improve myself while still embracing Who
I am right now because I know that I can
do better it's all about self love and
positivity and just feeling good and
doing good things for yourself in order
to improve yourselves so I'm going to
give you roughly ten tips so I have that
I think are really good for how to go up
this spring let's get started tip number
one is for skincare so I have been so
into night masks because you got to
leave them on your face overnight and
they soak in so you can find a night
mask for anything my favorite one is
from the body shop it's the tea tree
nighttime one and I really think if this
has helped my acne so much in the past
few months UX and what we tell my skin
isn't perfect yeah but it's never going
to be perfect for us all but it's
changed so much I should really do an
updated skincare routine I have talked
about this product a lot but I did want
to just recommend if you have maybe dry
skin or if you have combination skin
oily skin there is a night mask out
there for you somewhere and I recommend
the body shop ones because I actually
think that they do a lot and they do
really work definitely definitely an
easy thing you can do to help your skin
this spring my next book tip has to do
with personal feminine hygiene during
the warmer spring days so summer leave
has actually been kind enough to sponsor
this video so that we can share with you
guys the best way to stay fresh in the
spring and in summer so we all know in
this summer things get really really
hectic you're traveling a lot you maybe
have finals or when you serve to go out
with friends and it's just like warmer
outside some days we just really need a
quick and fresh pick-me-up enter some
receive so summer's eve has these things
called cleansing cloths and they also
have the manage travel sized version
that you can take with you on the go
anywhere and these just help to keep you
refreshed even on like your busiest
hottest summer or spring days I feel
like feminine hygiene is often the
conversation that
I feel a little bit shy hopping and I
just wish that when I always endure
someone had come to me and talked to me
about it and so that's why I want to let
you guys know that summer's eve is like
a really well trusted brand that i
personally have used for a really long
time and I trust you they are the leader
in feminine hygiene products they
actually make the best feminine hygiene
products in my opinion so this simply
summer Eve's
cleansing cloths really really really
help you keep from on the go or if you
keep them at your home they just help to
keep you fresh no matter where you will
harm and when you feel fresh you feel
confident and when you feel confident
you can glow and you take on the world
and you're wondering how they might work
the simply summer's eve cleansing cloths
basically help the body maintain a
natural pH and also you can tell that
their formulas are really really gentle
so if you have sensitive skin you'll be
just fine using them and of course
they're clinically and Gynecologists
tested and approved for safety they are
also hypoallergenic and alcohol-free
amen so you can by summer's eve at
pretty much any mass retailer or you can
even find them on Amazon for like under
five dollars so they are available in
this sense coconut water cucumber lily
and a lavender chamomile so thank you to
someone's you for sponsoring this video
i really suggest that you guys glow up
and check out there make it stop in my
description so my next tip we're going
up this spring is a good self-tanning
routine can someone tell me why when I
put on Sophie and her I instantly feel
ten times prettier and just like put
together I actually have it on right now
and a little bit bit concerned it's
gonna rub off on the white sleep that I
have on I really like the loving tan
extra dark foaming formula right now
I've never gotten a package from them
but they do send it out so a lot of
people but like I bought this with my
own money and I really like it so if you
needed a self-tanning products I really
recommend them and just having a perfect
self-tanning routine which means making
sure that you shave really well and that
you exfoliate the day before and that
you moisturize every morning and night
after you put it on yes yes
speaking of literal glow I need to plug
this product if you watch my hotel vlogs
you already know that I'm gonna say this
but the Fenty beauty of body lava
Rihanna
did not come to play this summer Rihanna
was like oh you want to glow up oh honey
here's a bottle of it because this stuff
is incredible worth every penny
I'm gonna just be wearing it all summer
long I'm actually surprised I don't have
it on right now I feel kind of dumb for
talking about it and not even wearing it
but trust me it is everything that you
need it more the next tip that I have I
actually don't even do right now but I
want to start doing and it's Jay rolling
I feel like dude rolling has become the
trend of this spring right now I learned
about it from learn Elizabeth but
basically you can buy on Amazon which is
what I'm gonna do for really cheap like
a jade facial roller and in the morning
you can like push against the flow of
like your values I don't know what I'm
saying right now but I know that I used
to do this in high school is something
that I bought on Amazon and it like
works so I'm gonna buy them again and my
face is so puffy in the morning it's not
like I want to start like Jade rolling
it just like increase blood circulation
and deep puffs my face a little bit
because I feel like that would just help
me feel a little bit more confident
maybe because if you guys see my vlogs
in the morning I'm always like holding
my face because it looks like I just got
my wisdom teeth taken out like my face
is so swollen in the morning my next tip
some of you guys might roll your eyes
but I think it's finally time to start
being more active outside if you're not
already a lot of us are so consumed with
technology and our phones and Netflix
and this and that and I love being
outside in nature and I'm so sad that
I'm like in the city and it's kind of
hard for me to get any fresh air but I'm
gonna start to make more of an
initiative to take time to go to running
and go to hikes more and to hang out
with people who have like apartments
that live like closer to nature and also
just like walk through with my groceries
more and walks and Starbucks more cause
that sounded so basic of me I couldn't
think of any other better way to
describe being after other than walk to
Starbucks but but anyways I really think
that was the warmer weather coming
there's no excuse to not just go outside
a little bit more and just breathe some
fresh air because that is like the most
essential part of being a human being is
fresh air and not and like none of us
get enough of it my next tip is another
face not tip as you can tell I'm really
focused on skincare right now so I write
somewhere that my masks because they're
so thick they're really good to put on
before you get into a shower so when
you're in the shower they soak into your
pores so I was like let me give this a
try and I swear by this now I don't take
showers without putting my baths on
first and then
in the shower I let the steam kind of
work it into my pores and before I get
out I wash it off and my skin glows
after the shower so I really recommend I
have a macho mask from this brand that
they sent to me and if you have any mud
masks just give it a try and thank me
later
my next gold tip um I don't even know if
this counts to go up tip but it's just
kind of like a life of me that I'm
sharing with you is I'm gonna start
intermittent fasting okay I'm not even
gonna start doing it I already do it
basically
I don't like eat breakfast and so like
10 or 11 o'clock and then I always stop
eating food around 8 p.m. at night so
that's not really a lot whoo
intermittent fast for a lot smaller of a
period of time but I'm gonna start to be
more aware of it because I realized a
lot of times that when I wake up in the
morning I'm still like somehow full from
the day before and I have all this
stored energy that I'd like to kind of
work off through life doing work in the
morning so now I actually want to
actively be intermittent fasting for
like I think just like a month or just
like for the next two weeks to see how I
like it and I can give you an update if
you guys want to know more about it but
I just thought I'd share that because it
seems like a really harmless way to try
a new thing that I have never done
before so I'm gonna couldn't start that
soon my last blow-up tip is to start
being a lot kinder to yourself it's
important to know that you are rare and
that you are beautiful just the way that
you are basically do not go through life
trying to seek approval through others
and you're not go through life expecting
the grass to always be greener on the
other side I encourage you to try and be
better and glow up but I also encourage
you to love exactly who and what you are
right now your life and your body and
your existence is not perfect my body of
my life existence it's not perfect but
it's an experience that I'm incredibly
grateful to have to be here so just keep
that in mind just try and be positive
and know that I love you exactly how you
are and that I believe in you to find
love in yourself too this spring and
summer and glow up in every way possible
because you deserve to thrive okay love
you guys so much and I will see you
later with an all-new video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
