to my channel if you're new here my name
is Liv I make new videos every Monday in
Friday I feel free to subscribe join the
family so also I can't say that without
a lot but today I'm gonna show you my
everyday makeup look for finals week
this video turned out so so stupid like
when you watch it you're gonna be like
what the heck what this is just like a
pure example of what finals are doing to
me I'm crazy I'm sleep-deprived so if
you haven't seen my vlogmas from last
week that was like the start to my
finals and my vlog was going up this
week it's gonna be my entire finals week
so subscribe if you are interested in
that at all but without further ado get
ready to see a pale pasty limb okay yeah
so um here we go into the video okay
we're gonna get cute so that we feel
better about life so our first step is
we're gonna put toner on I don't really
know what this does but it makes me feel
really clean and my cool refreshed I'm
awake I'm not dying inside ish well it's
not magic but you know it does a little
the next step is to moisturize your face
if you don't have a moisturizer that's
okay because when I get stressed I start
to sweat and that provides a pretty
decent natural glow you know so if you
don't have moisturizer it's okay just
you know let your stress shine through
but if you do want to moisturize I'm
going to use a argan oil and I'm just
gonna rub some together in my hands to
make it warm and then I'm gonna apply it
to my skin after your moisturizer you
can put on a primer so I'm gonna use the
glossier I'm priming moisturizer so this
is kind of like a moisturizer too and it
smells like lavender so yes because we
you know we didn't sleep last night and
it's nice to kind of feel rested so the
lavender just kind of makes you feel a
little like calm little put together we
love that love to fake it to make it
dang I really don't feel like getting up
to watch this right now if you don't
feel like getting up to wet your
Beautyblender um
just think about all the assignments
that you
do and you can start to cry and then use
your tears to a community Monday or just
say screw the Beautyblender and just use
your hands so I'm going to use the heart
heart guard I was gonna put on a
real foundation but then I realized
screw that
so you know I'm just gonna blend it in
with my hands because I could have
gotten up to webinar you under but why
do that when you just really don't have
to okay so I feel like that's pretty
decently blended on my skin that I don't
know it's yeah we're doing the best we
can so I would typically contour after
this but I think my contour stick is
breaking me out so we're just gonna put
on a little bit of a light bronzer I'm
gonna use this Too Faced bronzer that
I've had for probably 10 years and me
wait maybe this is what's breaking me
out sorry
whatever life is short cares anymore if
you want to try and like hold it so that
you know you look younger go for it I
just make it look like I'm alive and if
I don't bronze then I just look like a
circle and I remind myself of the moon
emoji we want to make it look like you
know if we fail our exams I still want
to be attractive enough for someone else
to marry me and take me out of my poor
miserable lonely life and I'm going to
live along by myself just kidding um
probably not with my advice I sounded
like an idiot there so the tip that I
have for when you're putting on your
concealer put on enough so that you know
you look alive you look awake but don't
put on too much that says like you had
too much time to get ready because you
still want your teacher to feel bad you
and make it look like you're a little
bit tired from studying all night and
that way there's more of a chance that
they'll curve your grade and then we're
also going to take this ten year old um
ambient lighting hourglass highlighter
setting powder and we're gonna put that
underneath our where we just the
concealer and everything cuz it looks
like a natural glow and no one ever has
to like know
it's not yeah I think that's pretty good
look so far
nice so as we know eyebrows are so
important and I've been using the
anasazi dip brow in dark brown mine hair
light eyebrows were the one step that I
will take my time on and we'll focus on
wow you can really see my acne up close
here don't look at that that's a stress
breakout we don't need a need to talk
about it but extend your eyebrows out as
far as they are willing and then kind of
like do this your brush and it just kind
of like does a thing and it looks good
from a distance my eyebrows look pretty
good up close though like you're looking
at right now they are messy just like my
life Jesus Christ I need to stop with
these jet depressing jokes okay so those
are on my face now feel good about that
really good about life we're gonna curl
our eyelashes calmly put my eyelashes in
between two metal bars that are cold and
scary and could possibly injure or blind
me but you do it for beauty oh my eyes
are so dry okay and then we're gonna use
the Too Faced better than sex mascara
I'm gonna show you guys my eyelash trip
right now because I get asked a lot you
know I have really long eyelashes but
this is what you gotta do okay sorry I
was like focusing the lenses talking on
the horrible youtuber okay I literally
will close my eyes and then like wiggle
it therap so like this does this make
any sense right now are you guys
learning anything that my job oh that
happened you guys why don't I care
enough to do my makeup right now Oh
get it together I can't sorry okay what
the is this I mean this is real
life you guys this is like an accurate
portrayal you know I've actually showed
up to class before I not even just cause
I should've to have a meeting with
someone the other day it was mascara all
over my eyelids I didn't realize until
after the meeting because I forgot to
take it off do you know how dumb you
have to be to do something like that
okay so now that that's done um I'm so
excited you guys always ask me what I
used for highlighter I literally use
this elf highlighter there's there isn't
even a tag on it
oh it's called moonlight pearls and this
secret that I do is I take my Mario
Badescu facial spray with you know it's
the green one basically um and then I
take this fan brush I was like a hair
all over it I'm a mess okay Brahe it and
then we just kind of go like that Wow
kinda live bitch and then I got some lip
balm at Trader Joe's only use high-end
products I need to check oh my god I
think I just need food this is
everything right now you want to have a
nice fine balance between looking like
you have good time management skills in
your professional and you can put on a
full like face of makeup and get ready
in the morning and be like healthy and
glowing and also make it look like you
stayed up all night studying and you
work really hard on this test or project
or whatever you're about to turn in and
do you want have a nice fine balance
you've got to walk that line perfectly
that's how you're gonna get a good grade
this is the new deep patootie I don't
like saying that out loud at all by
wetting Wilde's which is a great cruelty
free really inexpensive drugstore band
and this is what I've been wearing all
week so I put it on lips and then I hold
on and then I like rub it in and it's
matte and then you want to spray the
makeup because you know if you do fall
asleep in class and you know you're like
me and your hand is on your
you don't want that to like slide
up your face while you're sleeping so
you want to stay in place because one
time I fell asleep in class and my
eyebrows are really like smudged up my
face because my hand was on my face and
it was just a bad luck so make sure you
always wear your makeup because whether
you're crying
whether you're sleeping whether you're
sweating from the nerves whatever you're
doing
set your makeup okay I really hope that
you guys enjoyed this really chill
really realistic tutorial but hey I love
you guys good luck on your finals if
you're taking any of this week make sure
that you thumbs up and subscribe the
certifications on I love you guys so
much and I will see you next week with a
new long list and then a new video when
