to my channel if you're new here my name
is live today I wanted to offer you a
few things that I've recently picked up
that I realized every time I bought one
of these items I either was telling
myself oh this is like a self carrying
them or I was telling myself I'm gonna
spoil myself today so we did that quite
a bit this past week and I collected
enough stuff this past week that I was
like I want to show any of you just in
case you want to spoil yourself because
you deserve to or in case you want some
new self care items so without further
ado I'm gonna go into skincare first and
then I'll go into accessories and then
endless clothing for all the new stuff
that I bought if you like this video
feel free to give it a thumbs up and
subscribe for more content from me and
also if you have any ideas for other
things you could buy despoilers up with
please let me know below not that I need
to anymore but in case I need you want
some ideas leave them down below so
before I show you the skincare items
first I do want to say that I'm wearing
my endlessly creating crop top that I
created in my merch line and I just got
all of my merch yesterday in the mail so
I'm going to show you it try it on later
in this video because you guys when they
haven't seen you wear it yet and I'm so
in love with them Rihanna this is a size
small and this is me creating crop top
but definitely my favorite and I'm never
taking it off so now let's get right
into the video
so the first place that I bought stuff
at is the body shot and like a lot of
you guys know I struggle with acne and
just like a good skincare routine in
general so I've been really trying to
get at my skincare routine down and the
body shop is all cruelty free and mostly
vegan and so I have always really loved
their products and their pricing is
really good so I did show these products
in my day my life log that I posted last
week which I really never do if you
haven't seen it the editing is really
good the badge of the music really good
so feel free to go check that out but I
did show this stuff in the vlog what I
want to show it here again because I
really do love it the first collection
that I picked up but goes together is
the Chinese gym
and rice clarifying polishing mask and
the toner so this is supposed to
brighten and even your skin tone and I'm
obsessed with the smell of these like I
said in the vlog they're so invigorating
and I love that this mask you put it on
for like five minutes and it does its
job so I put this on right before I do
my makeup and like all moisturize like
my body while it's sitting on like right
after I get out of the shower and then I
exfoliated off and like my skin feels so
good so I really really love this
collection and I think it actually is
helping to even my skin tone out a lot
and also I think that this product is
changing my life
already and I've owned it for about a
week it is the tea tree night mask so
you put this on every single night which
is perfect because I'm such a routine
person that I don't like that even just
this mask I only put on like three or
four times a week with this I can put on
every single night and like I've showed
in that vlog at nighttime it has like a
really jelly-like consistency which is
amazing I think it's actually making a
difference like sometimes you don't know
and I think I really like no this is
making a difference so the next skin
care place that I want to do is lush and
I picked up a new moisturizer and
basically this is your supposed to be
super hydrating for a really dry skin
which is what I have so I put this all
over my face and neck every morning and
night and it definitely feels just
really thick and hydrating and I just
really really love that and also it has
like no smell and they say that things
that don't have any scent to them are
usually the stuff that's like the best
for you so I definitely really like this
so then I just get a product that I got
is from Ulta and it's the brand
philosophy and I didn't know that they
made makeup I thought they only made
like perfumes and skincare but this is
called hope renewed in a jar of skin
tint and I'm in the shade 3.5 sand which
is the lowest shade and basically I
really wanted to get this because I just
felt like it would be really nice to put
on my skin before class and this is
really really good at evening your skin
tone it's not like a full coverage
foundation but it just feels like
moisturizer that evens your skin tone so
I know it sounds like tinted moisturizer
but it's not I think that this is just
the way
like a really easy staple guillotine
foundation for me to just like throw on
with my fingers if I'm like running out
the door to go to Target or something so
that's why I just wanted something
simple because I don't really like
wearing makeup anymore like I'm wearing
it right now and I like you can't wait
to take it off in a little bit so I
think I'm gonna start what's my skin
gets a little bit better start not
wearing makeup and this is like a
product that I'm definitely gonna be
using the next place that I did damage
ah is sage you guys know I love sage I
love essential oils but I don't know why
sage is the only essential brand like
actually generally love no offense to
every other essential brand out there
you're great too but like I don't know
something about say it's just really
resonates with me so the first thing I
gotta say is I picked up more of their
foodie peppermint drops so basically
these are like organic tums and I just
love eating these after I eat they are
licorice flavored so throwing licorice
they had a ginger flavoured one too but
I love these I had them before and I had
to repurchase because I ran out but
mainly I got three new essential oil
roller balls and I love their roller
balls because I didn't really don't love
diffusing oils I don't know why but I'm
warm a candle person if I'm gonna like
make my room smell good so I really like
putting these on my body so the three
that I picked up the first one is called
you in psycho this one's supposed to be
good for when you're on your period you
put on your demand or where your cramps
are or just put it on your wrist which
is what I like to do typically no one
else in smell it but you I'm always
asking wherever I am I'm like you guys
so my such a loser now and you're like
no you're weird and then I got this one
which is actually for kids and it's
called a Roma fairy and it's for
sleeping I like this model the kids
sleeping us enjoy rollerball more than
the adult one so I picked up this one
and it's just like lavender and orange
and whatever else is in this it's just
really good and then the last one is
called arrived
revive and so this one's really good for
people who are into fitness and it's
just really energizing so I picked up
these
three and I've already started using all
of them and I just love the way that
they kind of just enhance my daily life
so yeah these are definitely my favorite
self-care of all things and I'm showing
the next pose I went into it was back in
Body Works and I picked up this candle
and it's amazing it is the rose water
and IV candle and it's made with
essential oils and it also comes in like
a really cute holder and I don't even
like this and I just keep it in my room
and it already like makes the room smell
really good it basically it smells like
tomorrow we asked you rose scented spray
so if you like that I really recommend
you get a scandal because it's so good I
just hit myself with it and then I also
picked up on many travels as very Jenna
of their stress relief body lotion
because this used to be my in high
school and I just forgot that I did
existed and when I saw it and I smelled
it I was like oh wow I need that the
finals week so I just got a little one
because I know that this is all probably
an amusing so moving on to accessories
the first and then I'll show you are
these sunglasses obviously they aren't
going to block the Sun for you at all
but they're definitely like a style
piece and I can't wait to rock them and
these are from so brand called monarch
Tokyo send these to me and I'm so
obsessed with throne so thank you to you
guys and I can't take an Instagram in
the it soon so the next accessory that I
got are from jewels by Maya and I got
them at the Melrose trading post you can
find her on Instagram I drove by Maya if
you can't already I have an obsession
with ranked moons and stars that's
jewelry for some reason and I also got
these earrings that I have in right now
that are just three stars so I have no
piercings so I want to get a star for
the faribault ooh because right now I
just have my diamond set in there but do
you guys know any other star earrings
suddenly am so that I can check them out
because I really want to find if they're
gonna go in my ear so now moving on to
fashion I have two new pairs of sneakers
the first thing I got at an event
yesterday which summer she invited my
team so thank you to you girl because I
wouldn't have these shoes it was for you
and for Puma and for Justine Skye and
you've all been amazing too I like these
shoes from Puma that are so fire so this
is a woman size eight and a half and I'm
not sure what style these are but if I
find
I will link them down below and the
other pair of shoes that I got from
adidas and these are the adidas mmds and
they are like the most popular shoes to
work out and that I see every fitness
youtuber using so I've been trying my
hands on a pair of these for so long it
was so hard
definitely size down like a full size of
these because these are size 7 and a
half and they're too big and I'm usually
a size 8 and a half so what but they're
super comfortable and I'm going to
wearing these today I'm a lot more and
next I know that this isn't clothing but
this is a mug for my merch line and it
says self love game on it and then so
that's a bit a little bit so much and I
put some white in serum story recently
but it wasn't on here and then I also
have this self-love game a t-shirt and
this is a woman small this fits me
perfectly but I just want to say like
it's just more of a fitted field and the
last thing is my survived t-shirt that
I'm so obsessed with so this is the size
of large because I love wearing
oversized t-shirts to bed or just out in
public with no pants on and it was so
funny because I realized that the
picture of me on this shirt
I had no pants on so I was like wow I
really don't like everyone dance which
is very true but this shirt is so soft
and so comfortable like I'm not just
saying that because it's my emerge but
this is just such this is such a vibe
like this in a size large ok guys so
that is all the new stuff that I wanted
to show you today I hope that you like
this video and I will see you guys later
let me so much bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
