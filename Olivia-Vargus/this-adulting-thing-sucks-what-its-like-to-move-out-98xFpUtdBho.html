so the weather today doesn't look that
great but I wanted to go to Runyon with
my mom and I don't know if it's gonna be
too cool to hike this table looks
perfect in here I'm like shucks
our couch comes today and I'm so excited
we're gonna put the couch right here and
we're gonna mount a TV on this wall and
we need to pick out a coffee table still
but as long as we have the big stuff
picked out that's okay
oh I'm moved by the way if you're new to
my channel subscribe this is like the
moving vlog number three so for today's
vlog I think that I want to take my mom
hiking and then half the morning and and
then have the afternoon to relax and
maybe shop like for normal cell phone
isn't furniture and just hang out there
and I don't know do it or else we can
and then at nighttime we're gonna go to
dinner I think and do my mom leaves on
the plate
so I just came back to my downtown
apartment to get my mom one last time
and it's just so weird being here it
feels like like I just told my mom it
feels like I don't actually live at the
other place and then it was a hotel and
that I'm getting kicked out and they're
like okay live the jokes up like go back
home like I feel like I'm I feel like
this is still my home like I feel like
this is another life like I feel like
I'm switching back and forth between two
lives and it's so surreal I don't know I
feel about it but I had to come inside
inside some paperwork and then my mom
also she got a quench bowl and she got
me a crunch bowl where's my yeah I'm so
excited and when I moved out of downtown
I was like I'm so sad I'm not gonna be
like eat crunch bowls every day yet I've
eaten a quench bowl and an affable every
day the love of my life is this path
amiable so I really just put a change in
link our and like look better right now
because I don't look that great but we
just got back from downtown it's like
one o'clock now because what we end up
doing is getting my car washed and then
like not detail but like I don't know it
took an hour basically and so then we
came back here and Allie and her mom are
shopping at the Millers Trading Post
today for everything else that she wants
to get my mom and I are gonna go hiking
but I wanted to show you first that our
couch came and so I want to show you
look like it looks it fits perfectly in
this space like it's a miracle so let me
show you oh it's like a light light gray
tannish color and what we like about it
is that this is a cushion so it's not
hard so it still is comfortable to like
sit over here because the couch that I
used to have it was basically like if
someone was sitting in the corner seat
no one else wanted to sit on the other
parts of the couch because it wasn't
comfortable but now the whole couch is
really really comfortable and like
spacious so it fits perfectly in this
space we have enough room to put like a
little coffee table or a plant over here
and something over here that Marisa
needs to get moved but then we're gonna
mount a TV right there which will be
super perfect and yeah the table here
looks so good so if you like a little
overview of the whole place look so cute
it's coming together we need a coffee
table still too and I think we should
definitely buy the plants to go in here
you're literally like going on a workout
like you have a your phone strapped to
your armband but here it's more like
Runyon's kind of more about like
leisurely activity of it like you're not
really here to work out you're here like
this person also really funny one up as
fast as you can without slipping okay so
I want to do you don't want makeup but I
want to do my skincare routine on you is
that okay okay I have like really good
skincare routine and I don't know idea
to be funny here okay so you she wears
no makeup and I thought myself how to do
makeup i watching youtube videos which
is how I got into YouTube in like
seventh grade bathroom huh so the first
thing we do is I'm going to use the body
shop toner this is the ginseng and rice
this stuff is so good it smells really
good it's really awakening yeah and it's
basically just like whoops really
brightening and really like energizing
okay so then this is a hyaluronic
moisture boost serum from Trader Joe's
so this basically just gives you like a
good set like I don't know
flush feeling skin hyaluronic acid is
like naturally occurring in the body and
it basically is just like I don't know
it's science team will comment down
below it
what does and so then you never wear
sunscreen correct
I have no air in sunscreen I'm gonna use
a nice group SPF 40 face on screen this
is also a good makeup primer and
like I just put all these products like
everywhere but I don't know how to like
get all over someone else's face so
putting it like the most obvious spots
this is from it's called Rodney and rose
and they're like a new makeup store
where they have like a bunch of for the
unique brand so this is called geudael
and it's in the Korean skincare section
and it's an eye cream and it's in sane
I'm just gonna put this under your eyes
and it's literally like that you you
want to have that information like that
it's gotta want to touch your eyes it's
like the most moisturizing and like
thickening lip formula
I don't know I need to go back comment
down below and the other Korean skincare
that I should try and con below what
Korean skincare is cruelty free cuz I
don't know to finish it off just to give
you a nice natural glow I'm gonna use
the Korres rose oil and this is amazing
well huh blew up yes blow up that's what
we love okay so this stuff I just take
like one or two drops this stuff smells
really good - it smells like rose I was
gonna have this over and that's just
like how I get a good natural glow what
is that stuff rose oil yeah Josh show
them your new skin all right let's go
we're gonna go to the Grove to go to
anthropology and buy a keychain and if
we have time buy new sneakers at Nike
and then we're gonna go to dinner and we
tried to get dinner reservations to
catch but they were all packed
they're like always looked so we're
gonna go that my mom and I just made it
to the Grove and we're gonna run into
anthropology it is
four or 15 so we need to meet Ali at
like 5:00 for dinner just as packed as I
imagined it would be
it's a Sunday it's like very crowded
here so it's really annoying but we went
to Topshop I didn't find I got new jeans
but I did not find a key chain but yeah
this is a bowl of spot I don't know
besides so after we finished eating
dinner we realized that we never got
Cinna holic for my mom while she's here
and that was like her one request I
think we have to have her try on holic
because it's so good it's all begin if
you've never heard of it
cinnamon bun place you can get cookie
dough on top of it and it's vegan and
it's to die for
we're both so full so we should probably
get on the plane with her for later but
we need to go get it so we're here yeah
I wish that cameras picked up first okay
let's take a look ready
oh my god I know that's why I said we
should split one like it's so it's like
as big as my hand and like look at all
the cookie dough okay take a waiter like
just the cookie dough like try you
didn't get back right vegan - there she
goes I gotta get out of here honestly
because there's someone who's been like
waiting for a while but well that's
honestly really some other way
you can go now I've to drive somebody
knowing how to get home from here
but um especially how pretty the area
around the airport is and also just the
golden hour in LA is so amazing
okay um sorry thing people cry me so
uncomfortable this is what like young
Olivia which is 18 and worried oh I
didn't expect or realize she would have
to go no I think that I like how what
did I get congested like why can't every
three hose right now oh my god like I'm
so dehydrated - idiot chopstick damn it
we're just gonna accept that I can't
stop crying here's the thing I don't cry
ever
think of it this is the first time I've
like right and so long I really cried
earlier today off-camera like last time
I cried I think this bad was when I left
Cape Cod last summer because that was
hard - I have really called for anything
somewhere like to us that's now where
there's just a lot of change at once
because not only did I move apartments
which is a huge huge change
I had my mom be here for me no she's
gone nothing you change so I just feel
like really rattled I think the best way
to use I know if you're rattled I just
hope my mom had a big time I wish she
was here just feel like a shitty
daughter because she was out there I
just hope you move and like the entire
time I knew in a moment that these
moments were really temporary so I was
like really stressed about that - I hope
you appreciate it I said you'd be the
president more like I couldn't it was
just like hard like forcing myself and
I'm like I would get set pressure well I
was actually just really tired I think I
couldn't you like never become an adult
I always thought there was like some
line that I would cross like some age
that I would turn out and magically like
be mature and i capable like handling
stress and like change and like weird
 those have to do like it doesn't
happen you just force yourself through
it it is terrifying
it is so much change
it's like a lot at once why the
away so much
Boyd mess look they do an outro
I'm just gonna say bye I love you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
