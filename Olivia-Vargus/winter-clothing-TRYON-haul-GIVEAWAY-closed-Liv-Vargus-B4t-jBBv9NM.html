to my channel if you're new here my name
is Liv I make new videos every Monday
and Friday feel free to subscribe and
join our family today I'm filming in my
bedroom on Cape Cod Massachusetts I'm
home for the holidays and my bedroom
isn't like the most convenient place to
film an it's not exactly YouTube proof
if you know what I mean I'm also filming
on my vlog camera so I apologize for the
quality maybe being a little bit low
today I'm gonna be filming a try on haul
of all the new clothing items that I got
if you saw I went to New York in my last
logs and I did a little bit of shopping
got some cute new winter stuff and I
also got a few things for Christmas I'm
gonna haul I'm not doing a what I got
for Christmas haul I personally don't
like the idea of hauling gifts but
there's some things that my mom and I
both picked out together that I'm down
to show you guys movie wearing it a lot
you might be asking more it's raw so I'm
gonna show you everything that I have
and let's get right into the video the
first place that I'm gonna start off
with this Topshop I love the Topshop
basic section I love this just plain
strength talk with dark navy blue
stripes and tan and I think it's so
comfortable and it's just so easy to
pair with like anything black jeans and
I definitely know I'm gonna get a lot of
wear out of this because I wear a lot of
their basics like all the time I also
picked up this same exact top in a
yellow mustard color because every time
I wear the color yellow everybody freaks
out as if the world is ending or
something is extremely dramatic going on
so I bought more yellow I actually have
another yellow thing in YouTube but
these tops again are really basic but
they last so long the quality is really
good and the last thing that I'll show
you that I got from Topshop is this
amazing belt that I'm so obsessed with
it has stars on there on the side and
you guys know why I mean it's I feel
like every girl will say stars are like
my thing but stars are everyone's thing
as you know I wear my moon necklace all
the time and I also have to start
earring then so this belt just felt so
appropriate because it's just me and a
belt and a pretty confident that this
belt is not made of leather when I
picked it out I like chucked that if it
is then I'm gonna be really upset
moving on to urban
they were having a buy one get one 50%
off deal and I went to their store in
New York and I've never seen Urban
Outfitters do anything like that before
so I was like oh god I have to get
something when it was probably stupid of
me but I've been really wanting to
venture out of my mom jeans and it's
like leggings and try and find some new
pants to wear so I found these tan ones
they're kind of hard to show right here
so I'll obviously try them on but I
thought that these were kind of classy
but still looked so casual and so
comfortable and could be dressed up or
down but they are wide-leg and you can
adjust the top of them to fit your waist
so they do still flatter you really well
and I just think that they're like a
good go-to I don't know me excited to
style these they're definitely out of my
comfort zone but we're gonna give them a
try I know you guys are going to love
this next thing I know I'm gonna wear it
so much it's this yellow sweater from
Urban Outfitters and it's a thick chunky
knit sweater that kind of balloons the
sleeves but comes in tight at the wrist
I have a lot of like neutral colored
sweaters but I never have any kind of
fun pops of color to add to those basic
outfits that I wear so I thought that
this would be like perfect I don't know
go to the next three things are all
gonna be champion so I got the champion
I thought sets on Amazon and once again
the top and the bottom don't match but
I'll still wear them separately but I
wanted a set but it's fine anyways you
guys know I love buying the men's sets
from champion and on Amazon they're so
cheap and I love that the men's that
come up high-waisted I'm literally
running a pair of my navy ones right now
but they're just so comfortable in such
a go-to as a crop top such as this one
and you just wear them with some of it
like Air Force Ones or some sides and
it's such a casual cute easy outfit and
I got the hoodie as well so here's the
hoodie and I thought this was also
really comfortable champion just makes
really like comfortable clothing and
that's mainly why I love it
I literally sleep in a champion hoodie
every single night especially when I'm
trying to preserve my hair if I like
just did it I'll put a hood up and I'll
tuck my hair in and that's going to be
how I sleep my hair stays curled all
night I'm also so excited about this
next find I got this at Macy's with my
friend like yesterday and it's a
champion men's hoodie again and it's a
large so it's oversized and I had a
white oversized hoodie from brandy
melville and it just got so gross from
wearing it too much like it just gets
off-white and it's not cute anymore so
here's a brand new
and the inside of it is navy gray and it
has a little champion logo up here and a
champion logo on the sleeve as we know
champion is very in but urban outfitters
and like Paxson says it for so much
money but you can literally like this
was $24 at Macy's like are you kidding
me and no one has to know the next
couple of things that I'm going to show
you our fitness legging so this first
pair I'm in love with because we love
purple purple Jim sharks leggings these
are the sleek sculpture purple wash in
the side small Jim shark leggings are by
far my favorite Fitness leggings they're
so comfortable and so so so so
breathable and flexible so I love them
and these ones also kind of help you be
a little bit snatch which as we know we
love to feel snatch especially at the
gyms so I definitely love these gym
sugar is almost always out of stock what
they are restocking soon so you can
follow them on Instagram to get those
updates this next time leggings are a
pair of Lululemon leggings that I really
wanted and they are the camo print these
were sold out for so so so long and my
mom ended up finding the quarter rise
ones which I don't mind but because I
have really long legs and then like a
really short torso short cropped
leggings don't flatter me so I might
return them and trust wait for the long
ones to come back and restock and I also
want to get a pair of just plain black
ones because my old plain black losses
on the leggings are completely worn down
so we need a new pair so I'm probably
gonna make a trip to the store soon so
these are our new Air Force Ones and you
know that I wear the white ones every
single day and so I was like I want to
get the mid rise ones and then I was
like maybe I should try getting the mid
rise ones in black because they're just
different I think that they're just so
badass
and just so I don't know so me I was
kind of a tomboy but also like la vibe
style I don't know how to describe my
style but if you know me then you know
that these are amazing and I definitely
recommend you can buy them in a kid's
side the large size and get someone like
a discounted price so definitely
definitely if you don't know apparel Air
Force Ones you need to get on that
so I've obviously always owned this moon
necklace I get so many questions about
it it's from a boutique on Cape Cod and
I went into the boutique to find it
because I wanted to do it with a
giveaway they don't have it anymore so
I'm gonna keep looking for one that will
replace it but I wear it
almost every day as we know and then
from the M Jewelers I got this necklace
that says live and I also got this
regular choker chain too I love the look
of these layers together I don't take
them off they're all high-quality
sterling silver metal so hopefully I
won't have to take them off and thus
like I want to clean them probably once
a month so yeah definitely investing in
nice high quality jewelry in 2018 that's
the goal so I briefly showed this next
item in one of my vlog I posted three
weekly vlogs and one daily vlog before
Christmas as my long series and in one
of them I got a bunch of new key
sunglasses and I have it yet shown them
on but I briefly show them in that vlog
so I'm going to show you them cuz when
we were in them all the time the first
pair is this really sleek pair that kind
of reminds me of just Kris Jenner vibes
like I can just see myself wearing these
on my hikes or just like out to go get
groceries and it's just kind of got this
vibe like don't talk to me and that's
what you need when you walk around
downtown LA the next pair is really
really similar but a little bit
different if you know what I mean I also
really like these and I think that
they're gonna get a lot of wear because
they're super classic the last pair was
free as part of their promotion that
they had and it's just a pair of silver
one and I just love silver sunglasses
because as you know I love silver
jewelry like hi yes this is a look so
I'm gonna be giving away one of each
pair of these sunglasses to one person
