to be ideal for people who don't use any
equipment or any gym machines besides
using a treadmill I'm gonna show you the
best and most effective exercises you
can do using free weights and resistance
bands both of things that you can find
on Amazon or you can probably find them
locally pretty easily so I'm gonna start
my workout today with a stretch I'm also
gonna listen to my January playlist on
Spotify for my workout if you haven't
seen I did just post a video getting lit
to this playlist this week if you want
to go watch it I will link it below and
then I get right into the cardio so I
split my cardio up into two increments
of 15 minutes to make it bearable so I
do 15 minutes to warm up in the
beginning of the workout and another 15
minutes of cardio at the very end of my
workout to make it thirty minutes all
together
another reason that I do this is because
it has been proven it's best to do your
cardio at the end of the workout anyways
so you can burn most of your calories
while doing weights and things which can
tone your body so for my 15-minute
warm-up I will always walk uphill on the
highest my treble will go and it burns
about 150 calories and it is so hard on
your legs you really feel this which is
why I like it for a warm-up rather than
running because now my body feels ready
to do more rather than being exhausted
from running like I usually am and by
the way I usually walk on speed three or
three and a half so the first circuit
I'm gonna show you has six different
moves using weights which we will repeat
three times if you're looking for a
shorter workout I suggest you choose
maybe only three of these but these are
my six favourites start with lighter
weights and move your way up each week
so you don't hurt yourself too so the
first workout that is my absolute
favorite is glute bridge raises with a
35-pound weight again you can use
whatever size weight that you feel
comfortable with this is just what I'm
gonna be using today the goal is to hold
the pose at the top or squeezing your
glutes and pulsing your legs with the
resistance band
to really activate the sides of your
glutes if you aren't using a resistance
band then just hold the pose at the top
for about three seconds I usually do
about fifteen of these and if you are
really squeezing and doing the ugly butt
at the top then you will really feel
this if you don't know what the ugly
butt is by the way it's Fitness
terminology for when you squeeze your
glutes during
exercises to activate them and your butt
flattens and perón's you have to do the
ugly butt to get a bubble butt it's just
the rules of the butt and if you aren't
comfortable with this then tie a sweater
around your waist to hide it but really
just embrace and respect the ugly butt
the next exercise which you me to twelve
or fifteen up is regular squats with
added weights if you can use a squat
rock then that's obviously really good
too but if not just hold a heavy weight
at the top and go down as low as you can
while keeping your core tight and your
glutes squeezed and activated the whole
time I do a wider stance with my toes
pointed out to get more side activation
and don't be afraid to lift with a
heavier weight here because you just
might be surprised how strong your
thighs really are the next exercise is
weighted deadlifts again some people use
their squat bars for this but the goal
behind this is to bend with your hips
and do the ugly but when you stand up
all the way if you can hold the pose at
the top for longer you will also get
more out of it make sure you bring your
arms to the sides you're literally
thrusting forward I know that sounds
kind of weird but your butt would thank
you for it the next exercise is honestly
one I really hate if you don't have
balance for this then just do regular
lunges with the weights but if you can
prop your toe up against a bench and
hold your core in for balance then do 12
of these lunges on each leg remember
it's better to go slow and doing this to
really get the full use out of the
muscles instead of relying on momentum
and speed to just get through the
workout this exercise I'm still getting
used to balancing during so I use a
lighter weight but if you can't use a
weight yet that's okay too
so I usually step up about 12 times for
each leg and you can really feel this in
your whole body just please be safe and
use something sturdy to step on and also
make sure you swing at your opposite leg
that's not stepping up to engage your
core and this last exercise in this
circuit before we repeat the whole thing
three times is cross-eyed London lunges
with a weight these are also really good
for building your side muscle holding
the weight above your head adds
resistance and gives your arms a burn to
just be careful not to drop it on your
head because that's always been a fear
of mine this next circuit is going to be
using resistance bands so the first move
is a classic donkey kick with resistance
band around your thighs and then to add
more intensity we pair it with a fire
hydrant side leg raise and do 12 on each
side the next move is a crab walk I
added weight but this burns a lot even
without the weight the
here is to stay low the whole time and
keep your glutes squeezed I usually take
five steps out and then back into
complete tannin and I do it twice facing
in opposite directions this next move
was really good for building your side
muscle again I added weights but you
don't need them you just need to open
your legs while you keep your knees bent
and feet together and do about 12 on
either side and I'm showing you two
different variations and the last
exercise in this set before cardio is
another variation of the bridges we
started the first circuit with but this
time our legs are up so this is a
perfect example of the ugly butt but
like I said just get used to it and that
completes this set which you can also
repeat three times in order to have a
full workout finally the cardio I almost
always end with is this pyramid
high-intensity interval training workout
it takes about 15 minutes and I started
off the first minute just by walking and
then I jog on speed 6 for 1 minute and
then I step off to the side when I step
to the side I increase the speed up
halfway to 6 and a half and jog for
another minute then I repeat the same
process so I step off and increase the
speed to 7 and then I increase it to 7
and a half and then we go to 8 and then
we start to work our way back down and
we go from 8 to 7 and a half to 7 to 6
and then 6 and a half and then finally
to 6 and I do 1 minute on each speed
then I walk for whatever time is
remaining and I stretch after everything
is done thank you for watching my
workout you guys if you liked it please
