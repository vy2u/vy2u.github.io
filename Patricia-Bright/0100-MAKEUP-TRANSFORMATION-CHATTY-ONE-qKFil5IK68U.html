from zero to 100 and so on just left the
comment that sometimes my lip liner can
look a bit troll on I am now feeling
like a hundred hey guys welcome back to
my channels I'm sure you're looking at
the background you're thinking of where
are you at Patricia well if you don't
know if you're not following my vlog and
my snapchat and stuff you might not know
that I basically have been having house
renovations for the last three to three
months plus right so we basically
changed our upstairs roof or attic
because you like my color or depends on
where you're from and it's not like our
new loft bedroom oh I am very excited to
film here because it's like much bigger
much brighter and I decided to kind of
do it how I've always wanted to do like
my bedroom space so yeah I'm in much
better spirits but the same breath I
basically had like I've not done
anything I've not like done my makeup or
just brushed my hair basically been a
bum for like the last week so I wanted
to show I wanted to kind of do a
tutorial like taking myself from like
feeling like a zero or like like a three
to like making myself for a little bit
more tip top in the looks department
sometimes when you don't like do
yourself art you kind of feel really
like crappy basically which is what I
felt I might like the kid now it's time
to finally like you know spruce myself I
pervasively spruce myself up once a week
if anything and film a video so I'm
going to do that today if you guys want
to see a loft like bedroom tour let me
know I'll probably do it anyway but just
leave a comment and leave a thumbs up
and then I'll know if you guys really
really want to see or not but today
seeing a spring is officially sprung I'm
gonna just do a kind of springy freshy
icy look I'm basically going to take
myself from a zero to 100 and because
that's how I basically feel and I know
those are people gonna appreciate look
amazing thank you so much but you never
you just you just not feel in ten you
just need to take some time to yourself
this is what I'm going to do right now
I'm going to relaxing Lee take my time
to myself and just improve the face yeah
that's what we're gonna do I'm just
going to moisturize my face
Estee Lauder's such a night cream but I
find it really moisturizing I just use
it in the day I'm going to use my NARS
all day luminous weightless foundation
and the reason I'm using this one is
because it's quite warm I can get loads
of rich walnuts in this and I'm Phil
know you feel dry and gray that's what
you really need like I go with a bit
more color I definitely have
discoloration on my neck but you know
what it's not too bad and actually just
gone back to using these real technique
brushes as well they're super affordable
and sometimes you just want a simple
brush collection I really genuinely feel
like these are a great starter brush
collection and sometimes I just like
simplifying all the stuff I've gone I've
like super have a massive clear out of
my entire house I'm going to probably
share with you like my journey to let
minimalism so I'm going to move on to
eyebrows which I have changed I feel
like people definitely been noticing my
eyebrows are a little bit more
structured basically I am using a pencil
and this pencil is from Tarte
oh my gosh I've used it so much it has
worn off it's a black brown pencil such
an eyeliner pencil but I've been loving
using this on my brows the colors
perfect it's super creamy but I have to
be careful because you can kind of
overdo it
I'm just so over the dry anastasia
beverly hills dro i just chase utley
draw a dark ride on the bottom and it's
super pigmented
and then i'm just going to draw these
lines in and basically that's what i do
it really doesn't need a lot and its
really light strokes I just love the way
it feels it's so creamy so they can end
up looking a little bit dark and a
little bit strong but usually once I put
my concealer and everything on it looks
a lot nicer and I'm still getting the
bare minerals you guys know me I'm one
of these people when I like something I
really like it so this is a really good
concealer I know you guys might love the
Estee Lauder Double Wear MD this is a
great alternative and I always say it
you don't need to have like really fancy
products you just need to take your time
and nowadays when I do my makeup I just
take my time I just enjoy myself when
I'm doing it
like put my music on and they make so
much difference to how you end up
looking you know I'm just going to use a
poof to just blend that all in really
like these cheapy poof because you can
just buy them for like boots you don't
really need a beauty blender or anything
like that and they're like two pounds or
something you can get a bag of them and
when you're done just throw them away
because I'm not going to lie I get
really bored right in washing all my
stuff and I do do it obviously but if I
can just throw them away then why not
I'm going to use the cream contour kit
from Anastasia Beverly Hills and again I
don't not a big fan of the product but
I'm not one to waste something I prefer
using a foundation because I find it
easier to blend but the colors are good
basically excuse me because the Sun is
coming in and out so sorry that the line
is changing I already feel like better
like I could just go like this just
Foundation and brows and feel like nice
looking but we're just gonna you know
put a little bit more effort let's go
from not 0 to 50 let's go from 0 to 100
I am going to use the Sasha uppercut
powder under my eyes I really really
really like this powder figures
excellent my literally last spring it's
like my favorite time of the year it's
just before summer which someone
sometimes is a little bit greasy for me
but spring is Right perfect so all my
eyes I'm going to just use it my classic
which is the Sigma warm neutrals palette
if you've been watching me long enough
you know this is a favorite of mine and
when I'm feeling like not all that I
just go to a classic I'm not going to do
something like crazy and my last video
had blue eyeshadow on I felt really
weird wearing it so stick with the
neutrals that's what I personally like
and I'm just going to add a little bit
of extra purple just to like warm up and
stuff but I basically go for the matte
beige and I want it to end massive on a
cut crease but I'm going to try and give
myself a little bit more defined line so
basically create a line and then I
basically add more color above the
and blend out and I have been loving
wearing black eyeliner I just feel like
it always makes my eyes stand out more
and I know some people don't like it but
personally I'm like a big black eyeliner
fan all right so this mascara here oh my
gosh it's the false lash Ascot mascara
from L'Oreal this mascara is everything
and I'm not a big like oh I really love
this mascara kind of person but I really
love this mascara I just love the
applicator and I find it really does
lift my lashes right from the roots
makes my lashes right from the roots
sounds like I should be on an advert but
it genuinely I just love it right so my
lashes are my favorites the velour ones
I got winging it which our favorite and
also wispy sweet nothing and I do have a
discount code that should be working in
the description box below I feel like
that was super quick than like super
easy I don't know why because I might
just really relax right now I'm gonna go
for like a mole on my lip I've got this
new lipstick from wires and other color
I don't know it 58 I'm not sure but it's
like a nice movi color which i think is
nice for spring but I always align my
lips with at night more I just find this
is like the best kind of movie lip liner
for women of color and someone just left
a comment that sometimes my lip liner
can look a bit troll on and that's not a
term we use here because I don't if what
if this makes any sense to say we don't
have chola people here but I know what
it is so I'm gonna try and blend it
right oh it was hilarious when someone
said that to me I wasn't offended at all
um I'm just gonna go with this and I'm a
big fan of the YSL lipsticks and
sometimes they've got a bit of a strong
smell which people do definitely notice
but this one doesn't
I definitely love a bit more of a
Gaussian lip but for a quick trick I'm
going to try and mattify it I am going
to use the NYX HD look
this powder it's so so good and you can
use this to basically make a lipstick
net just going this is poof so any
lipstick Matt was just a bit of powder
and this is what I love it means that I
can find colors in like gloss or satin
and just make it matte if I want to
without having to spend money on matte
lipsticks and I just love the way that
looks and in general this powder here
yes this powder here is so good I use it
all over basically well uh that is my
face done I think I'm about a 70 70 %
there I'm just gonna do my hair you guys
do know I'm hair lazy I've got a weave
in my hair stylist came and did a wee
for me because um I'm about to give
birth and I was like I don't want to
have to deal with a you part or anything
so hopefully I'm going to style this
it's really easy to style it looks crazy
because it hasn't been brushed in like
three days
I've looked you've been wearing a bun
but I just do my hair super quickly
don't know this is why hair hair
extensions I do have a discount code in
the description box below I'm really
loving all the support that we have had
thank you guys so much
I don't do lots of promotions and stuff
but it's not my thing I feel like
products usually speak for themselves
and we have so many repeat orders that I
mean we're really happy with how things
are going
so I've literally just brushed that and
brushing makes a big difference I'm
literally just going to take big chunks
and I'm just going to want my hair and
if you don't know this one is bad ass
it's the where's it from
waw oh my gosh it has a spiral head it's
amazing
personally I don't like lots of hair
extensions especially not at the moment
I'm far too hot and bothered for that
and I don't really like no it depends
everybody's got their way of wearing
their weave mine's quite um simple
compared to lots
but I like that I feel like that's just
kind of more preventative of me not
going to play with this too much because
um the waves are really loose anyway so
they don't really need to break them up
but normally if I do like really tight
waves I'd usually break them up but I
don't really need to do that with this
right the only thing I'm going to do is
just put a little bit gel my edges now
because they're looking all kinds of
yeah
excited and I use darken lovely because
I actually really like the alcohol-free
gel it's not really an edge control or
anything like that but it it does slick
down my quote-unquote baby hairs all
right yeah that is me done I am now
feeling like a hundred and it's so quick
and easy to do and I don't say like
feeling good is based on how you look
but sometimes just making that little
effort which I always say can genuinely
bring your mood up a little bit so yes
that is me done and I hope you guys
enjoyed I'm going to do a video for some
day so let me know what you guys want to
see or hear me talk about I haven't got
any clues right now I'm just recording
on the fly right now because I feel like
my life is literally on hold so yeah
whatever you guys want to see let me
know I should I would do the room tour I
might do like a beauty hacks that
everyone should know kind of idiot so
let me know it and I'll catch you later
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
