gonna excitable mood because I've come
up with an ID and you know me randomly I
just come up with these ideas for
YouTube just because of situations that
have happened and genuinely I had a girl
problem this vacation for those of you
who can't tell I'm run at home I'm on
vacation in Buffalo now and I'm sitting
on a spin ship yes that is a bit random
but yeah I have a problem while coming
on vacation a definite girl farm I was
like oh my god I need a solution and
then I thought to myself this would be
an amazing series like girl problems
basically something I really want you
guys to get involved with me give me
more ideas for videos and stuff like
that to address all these different girl
problems so I think what I'll do is you
at me patio loves you and then hashtag
girl problems and then write the girl
problems and so I know that it's to do
that or leave a comment below on these
videos on different girl problems that
you think that we should actually talk
about or address or see what other
people have to say about it that should
be really really fun let me get started
into this girl problem or my genuine
girl problem ever came on vacation so
you know me on vacation you want to be
fresh you want to be baby smooth mm-hmm
nothing delivers and baby to move a lot
of the time however but you know nice
fresh shape you know how it is and for
me if I do not exfoliate my gosh it is
razor bump City like my armpits like
it's just not nice basically if I do not
exfoliate so when I'm shaving or fried
hair move by wax I am
exfoliating like daily low and behold
I've got here and where is my
exfoliating unit Patricia has left it at
home
so my mind is glitchy like No
yeah literally that kind of note is that
what am I gonna do like what am I going
to do and I'm not really close to
pharmacy or like a boobs or something to
get a writer it's relating me so instead
me being nifty as we women are you guys
always misuse me come on I found this a
toothbrush not I found it like lying on
the floor but obviously we get
toothbrushes supply to our room from the
broom service and I was like feeling
this I was like oh this connects foliate
and I've been using this I was thinking
to RISM why have I not found out about
this a lot earlier like a toothbrush
it's absolutely amazing exfoliating
implement so it's like it's a really
really good and I really think that this
is a solution to the guard problem in
growing hairs or prevention in growing
hairs I know it might seem weird but I
think it's really really good it's not a
toothbrush that I use on my mouth like I
don't want to use it under my armpit and
then stop brushing my teeth obviously I
hope no one thinks that but guys I think
this is a definite solution in some way
I want to kind of address the whole and
the whole goal problem of ingrown hairs
so number one it's important to keep
your skin nice and moisturized
beforehand so you shouldn't be shaving
on skin that is or waxing or whatever on
skin that is broken or tight or damaged
get that skin in good order
moisturizing and even using oil such as
grapeseed oil or even extra-virgin olive
oil
these are great ways to lube Luber the
areas and just keep this nice and supple
and cheap beforehand I was watching Goss
the makeup artist his channels really
amazing I'll put a link in the bottom
bar this guy knows everything about
everything basically and he was
mentioning the fact that you know she
consider how many blades that you have
on your arm your razor so if you've got
four blades or three blade literally
you're just a brazing your skin that
many times so the less blades that you
have the better for your skin in the
long term as long as you keep you know
you don't use these like 20 times just
once or twice keep the blades and
and sharp or just use disposable ones
they're in a good position and also use
a nice again lubricating lubricating
shaving gel and something that makes it
supple when you are going to shave and
then finally exfoliate and my girl
solution for exfoliation is the
toothbrush so yes guys that is a this
video the Gulf of a video some of the
other ideas I have and probably going to
address like uneven skin tone and elbow
the kneecaps and things like that and
show you some of the solutions that I
have but problems like oh my gosh I have
got nothing to wear oh my gosh I feel so
fat oh my god I feel so skinny oh my
gosh I'm going out with a group of girls
and I can't dance I'm the worst dancer
ever things like that basically
but do leave your comment and other
solutions for girl problems below so
that we can start addressing them and
have fun doing it yeah this is gonna be
fun
so like this video so if you do think
it's a good idea I think it's a good
idea anyway so I'm going to like it
okay bye
