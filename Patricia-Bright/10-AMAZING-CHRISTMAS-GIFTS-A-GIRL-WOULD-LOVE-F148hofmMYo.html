guys so we are close to Christmas my
thought I'd do a video on Christmas gift
I did and specifically the girls like a
mean girls who like youtube if you have
friends girlfriends who you think Ont
the same kind of thing as goes on
YouTube are off you're buying you don't
know what to get your girlfriend and
she's like to you too should probably
like the things that I'm going to live
so let me quickly start off with what
I've got in store so number one a pair
of boots are amazing for Christmas when
it's cold it's perfect I think you
should go for the classic Chelsea boo
because they can be worn in winter
they're really trendy really fashionable
you can either get a pair like the
Arizona from Topshop or you can get an
alternative to prepare from number 21
number to a statement ring or a
statement piece of jewelry I love rings
and I would love the wire cell RT ring
it's very very fashionable it's it's
overdone but I still feel like it is a
classic I would not complain if I got
one of these wonderful thing is that you
can get it in multiple different stone
colors you can pick what you know her
favorite color is and then that's a
great way to choose a ring if you can't
afford that you can go ahead for an
alternative but still as classic which
would be you know another statement
rings from something like that be online
com I've got a beautiful ring from there
and I know any girl would love this for
Christmas
so watches chunky gold watches chunky
rose gold watches kind of like this one
I love and rose gold is my favorite if
it goes with lover rose gold michael
kors watch if not you can get
alternatives from somewhere like a
source com where they've got other big
chunky rose gold watches so Phelps
purses bag all those kind of little
Trinity things you can never go wrong
you can get a musky no belt for your
girlfriend great if not you can find
them were fakes on ebay but the gig
often fate just nice chunky belts from
Topshop or something like that so makeup
palettes if your garden to make up and
she's got a lot of different ones or
can't really not can't really afford but
doesn't want to get a mac The Naked
palette is a great alternative for all
the colors all of one Paulo any palate
debenhams has loads of them kind of
beauty collection but i would definitely
recommend the naked palette and it comes
with a primer as well any kind of
expensive a beauty or skincare product
will be greatly appreciated by any
female recommendation by install is deca
law which is a facial oil it's great for
sparse or any marks kind of like bio oil
but a lot more expensive but a lot more
I think it really works based on the
reviews so this is random but storage if
she's like me or your friend is like me
and governments like me I love bits of
fashionable storage it's a case of I
still live at home live at home but when
I move out on my gosh I'm gonna have
storage everywhere like beautiful and it
called a critic storage and you can get
these from Muji
and I know that Nia has some of these
and they look fabulous when you put all
your makeup products in if you want and
your friend or your girlfriend to clear
all makeup up this is a great way to
help her to get tidy so books are a
great option for Christmas presents and
I personally love books on travel
because I'm going to travel the entire
world events about seven countries
that's going to make let's make that 27
if not 37 countries in the entire world
and great journeys by lonely planet
everybody who goes traveling has a
lovely planet book great journeys is a
great one if your God for nitrogen war
even has aspirations to travel I think
it's a great book and another book I'd
recommend is by Lorraine Pascale which
is baking maze easy I cannot bake but
when i watch her series i'll bet yes
this is a book had one and I think any
cookery book is great for any girls
another beautiful gift that you can get
which isn't necessarily a tangible or
material gift but it's a gift of life in
a gift to charity and I know I would
really appreciate a gift with someone
contributes towards someone else and
there's a website called charity
dashboard where you can give to a number
of different charities as a Christmas
gift to someone else me personally
anything to do a children Save the
Children and Christian Aid Action Aid
and NSPCC there's a charity that I as a
female just love to give and back to and
would really appreciate if someone gave
me a gift that was given to someone else
finally electricals or software was a
great idea I know that that's what I
want I'm hoping that my husband gave me
an imac you know hope you're watching
Mike oh but yeah any kind of you know a
tablet or kindle or ipad 2 i'm at home
any kind of electrical gift if you can't
afford electrical gifts any kind of
software to update how existing
technology that she has I think I would
really appreciate that even like wii
games those are great great options that
are out there okay i saw i hope you
enjoyed that video and it's given you a
few ideas all the links will be listed
at the bottom for the items that I've
talked about for those of you who
literally just want to check check check
or business off and it's great for your
girlfriends and for the guys and your
friends for the girls and just anyone
who likes youtube like I do so guys
