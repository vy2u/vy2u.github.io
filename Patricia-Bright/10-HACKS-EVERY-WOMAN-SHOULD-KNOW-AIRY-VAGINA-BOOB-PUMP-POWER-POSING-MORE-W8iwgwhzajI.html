so today I have ten hacks that every
woman should know and I'm feeling all
kinds of woman motivated right now it
might be because of the new Beyonce
album I don't really know but today I
definitely wanted to do this video to
give some of my ladies some tips that I
know that are very useful if you didn't
know them already I'm sure there are
plenty that some of you guys know and
maybe few that you don't but hopefully
you find it useful and these hacks
definitely pertain to some things that
US ladies just need to kind of remember
once in a while one of those kind of
sneaky things you keep in your back
pocket for the times with things ain't
going so well you got a special
occasional you need to improve your
confidence hopefully these are help
point if you guys have any other
suggestions put them down in the
comments below because I'm sure there
are people who will appreciate them so
tip number one is to let your lovely
lady garden or vajayjay or vagina or
vulva or downstairs region air out once
in a while so in the day avoid silk and
synthetic fibers because actually what
they do is trap moisture and for those
of you who suffer from yeast infections
or bacterial infections or just a really
uncomfortable sweaty nether region that
might be one of the reasons why so
alternatively go for things like cotton
underwear and at night if you don't mind
definitely go commando being nude never
hurt anybody and it's a nice way for
those reasons just to get a fresh air
you know once in a while so hack number
two is for those of you guys who want to
go Bronner's if you want to go braless
but you don't want to free the nipple
because you might have big order nipples
like me that like to say hello to
everyone in sight but you might not also
like nipple covers that can be a little
bit hot and sweaty and sticky and
painful when you pull them off a great
alternative is to try nurse
has I've just found out about these and
they're amazing because they can stick
to your clothing instead of sticking to
your boobies and if you're someone who
might suffer from the boobs sweat as
well it will suck off that moisture nice
and easily they're breathable and they
have a little extra cushion as well if
you need that additional padding so hat
number three is sticking with the
boobies and if you have a bigger night
out or a special event or a photo shoot
and you want your boobies to look a
little bit a little bit more perky then
why not try some chest exercises
anything from push-ups to planks to
range of exercises will actually
increase your bust size for a small
period of time the same way for those of
you who workout in the gym
guys and girls and you might get that
pump because you've had an increase
circulation to that area so the error
looks a bit more fuller and a little bit
more juicy the same thing can happen to
your boobie and chest regions so if you
can get a 15 to 20 minute chest workout
before your special event then why not
do it to get that extra plumpness so
hack number four might be a little bit
controversial but for those of you who
might be suffering with the facial hair
and I've tried everything else and it
doesn't really work on you and why not
go back to the easiest option which is
to shave your face lots of people are
scared that your hair will grow back
thicker and darker but this just isn't
true and many say that men actually age
better because they shave their face and
actually it provides a little bit of
exfoliation which is great for the skin
and giving yourself that glow no one
saying you should go ahead and get a
full blown Gillette razor and shaving
foam every single day but you can get
one of those little handheld razors and
get rid of some of those pesky hairs and
see what your results are but just be
careful because what you don't want to
get a razor bumps and ingrown hair so
make sure you put a little bit of
conditioner on your face before you do
that so hat number five is coconut oil
coconut oil coconut oil coconut oil if
you don't know about coconut oil get to
know it is a miracle product it can be
used for whitening your teeth because
you can do oil pulling it can be used
for giving yourself
hair treatment it could be used some
moisturizing your skin and it can be
used for taking off your makeup now if
you don't have a tub or jar of coconut
oil in your closet you need to get it so
hack number six is all about looking
confident even when you're not feeling
confident and I would say try power
posing power posing is basically about
changing your physical position and
stature in a way that's going to make
you look better they say that people who
look powerful or are powerful have an
open and upright posture as people who
are anxious and unconfident have a
curled in and closed
posture if you're someone who's about to
go somewhere that you don't feel that
comfortable around all you're going to
do a speech or do something that you
don't feel so good about change your
posture and what I like to do is to go
into like the unconfident posture so
called up and then take myself all the
way out of it and lift up a great thing
to do is imagine that a string is being
pulled from the back of your head up and
that will lift you up and make you look
ten times taller and as they say fake it
till you make it a hack number seven if
you are trying to get ounces out of
someone be a guy a girl a friend a
friend of me and but they're not being
very open what you have to do is
actually ask a question and wait wait
wait wait wait until it gets awkward and
this is a social coup that basically
tells the other person that they need to
fill in the situation because you are
not speaking as humans we are the kind
of people who we always want to keep
talking if we want to get the answer out
of someone but sometimes you just need
to allow that silence to happen and they
will fill in the blanks rather than you
doing it eventually an awkward silence
will always cause someone to fill it out
but if you're in control of the
situation you'll feel comfortable about
keeping that silence going until the
other person gives up the information
you want so hack number eight is for
those of you who are tired of rushing
especially when you're getting ready in
the morning or to go to the work or to
go to an event
something like that and you always find
that you're late even though you do
these things all the time this hat is
all about creating a playlist to get
ready to and this what's one there's one
because it's great to get ready to music
in the morning but you kind of give
yourself like a grace and I'm kind of
present I love competition and another
race it takes a bit planning to do this
what you need to do is basically time
yourself doing the certain key things
that you do every day so that might be
having a shower doing your eyebrows
taking breakfast all these different
things what you want to do is select a
track for doing that specific activity
so having a shower might be a Justin
Bieber check making your breakfast might
be a Beyonce track and getting dressed
in the morning might be Taylor Swift who
knows whatever you like to and so every
time you're doing those things in the
morning the track is a cue to start that
thing and also to end it before the
track ends and what you'll have is a
really cool playlist of cool music that
you know very well to get you ready in
the morning so hack number 9 is for all
my shot a holux who sometimes find that
they go to the shop and they pick things
that either they've already got or
things that don't go with their style or
their closet and they end up wasting
money why not take a picture of your
existing shoe collection your current
wardrobe and just your favorite things
before you go to the shops that way
before you pick up an item you're able
to have a look at what you've already
got and to see if the thing you're about
to buy goes of your closet or is an
unnecessary waste of money
my last hat is a general hat but it's to
use your smile and your eyes and I know
there are some feminists out there who
are not going to like it but we're all
firmness realistically because we are
all women
but why don't use your god-given talents
smiles and eyes are a great way to get
what you want
in a way that isn't negative and I
always say if you're smart use your
smarts if you're beautiful use your
beautiful if you've got a great smile
use it and if you've got eyes that
people sink into then let them sink so
guys those are 10 hat I feel like every
woman should know I'm sure that you guys
might think of some other ones that
everyone also you should know so do need
a comment below some of the hacks that
you actually do use because I love to
read them and I might do another video
