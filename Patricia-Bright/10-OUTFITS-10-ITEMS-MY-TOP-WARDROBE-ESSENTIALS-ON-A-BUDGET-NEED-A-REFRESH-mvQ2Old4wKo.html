featuring some of the things that I
would call my wardrobe essentials again
this is just my view on it but I wanted
to share some of my favorite things and
if you are someone who might be trying
to build a wardrobe or get a sense of
style and maybe you are on a budget then
these are the key things I think you
need so I hope you enjoy and it gives
you some ideas so the first thing is the
little black dress I absolutely love a
little black dress because you can wear
it anywhere without looking over or
under dress this is a really slinky one
that I bought a couple of months ago
from misguided they have some really
good and affordable options so after
that it's got to be my next favorite
which is the leather jacket I think
everyone needs one of these in their
wardrobe be it faux or real and it just
adds that little bit of edge to an
outfit I love this jacket here I've had
it from three years from H&amp;amp;M I love this
jacket and once you get the perfect one
never let it go after that it is the
white tee paired with something like a
leather jacket and some ripped denim it
looks super cool but you can also wear
it is something like a blazer I say buy
these cheap and cheerful because they do
get messy again you can get these in
Primark and hmm and these are basic to
always have in your wardrobe
so next it's the smart blazer I love to
throw a blazer over everything if I want
to look like I've tried now this is more
of a cape blazer but the principle
remains the same if you're someone who
might need to get dressed up on
occasions but doesn't really like to
trust me a blazer makes everything look
like you've tried now next it's the
pencil skirt another one of my favorites
and something I think that goes of all
shapes and sizes can wear just throw in
a guard or awesome control pants to suck
all your lumps and bumps in but there's
something about a pencil skirt that is
very very feminine and you can get these
short or long or like this bowel
asymmetric
after this it's the chunky knit now
depending on what kind of climate you
live in I am from England and it's
always cold and there's something about
chunking it that looks really just warm
and cozy and almost makes you feel like
you're wearing a duvet all day while
looking really good I think one of these
is perfect to have in your wardrobe
after that it's the smart black cup
rouses and that's probably because I
used to be a city girl but I always need
to have a pair of smart black trousers
because you never know when you're gonna
need them but if you ever want to look
neat and tidy your worthies and you'll
feel really good about yourself
especially with a blazer so another
essential to have in your wardrobe is
the shirt you can wear this buttoned up
button-down tucked in let out for a
casual look all really cool and trendy
look the shirt is definitely am
essential to have in your wardrobe so
some might disagree with me and it's the
leather trousers but these are
definitely in essential for me I find
them to be a standout piece that goes
with so many items and whenever I put
these on on a night out I feel super
gorgeous and super glamorous but I can
wear these in the day just as well so my
final essential is the skinny jean if
you haven't got a pair of these I don't
know where you have been sleeping
probably under a rock I love them in
denim indigo why all the different
colors but the great thing is that they
have got so much variety you can wear
them with trainers here with boots and
every time you will look flawless so
guys that is my take on the essentials
to have in your wardrobe I'm sure I've
missed out on some too if you have any
other suggestions or recommendations
please do let me know and the other
subscribers in the comments so that we
can all share together thanks for
watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
