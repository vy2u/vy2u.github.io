can see I have a lovely guest here I've
got Victoria you have a lovely day today
haven't we nice from em and if you don't
know Victoria channel is in the fro and
she's an amazing blogger and I'm always
inspired when I see a post and
everything and you're really good on
YouTube as well but today we wanted to
do a video on how to always look put
together cuz you know what it can be
like when you're rushing we don't have
that much money and you know you could
look like a tramp or you could look
amazing if you want it to yeah
so we're going to share I think were
going to do five tips each I'm just
looking good when you need to look good
so number one is all about having the
perfect jacket I think it's really
important for people to invest in a good
jacket and they don't have to be
expensive they just need to have a
really good cut and I love jackets with
a really large lapel so I recently just
bought this Zara jacket which has got
really large lapels and it's got a belt
and it kind of looks really really
gorgeous so even if I'm wear like a
t-shirt and just skinny jeans I look
really put together so if you can't
afford a fancy outfit try and get a
really nice jacket because it makes a
lot of difference yeah especially the
belt as well yeah since she went then
it's like wrapped in it looks so cute
one lovely and flattering
it's gorgeous color I love it and the
texture looks beautiful so I've just got
a few beauty tips I thought would be
good just for anyone that wants to look
more put together quickly first one I'll
go with is a lip liner I never use a lip
liner until like a year ago that's what
I always like lip liner is like a new
thing but it makes so much difference so
much different you can completely
transform the shape of your lips of it
yeah because I've got quite small lip so
I find if I use this and kind of
slightly over draw they just look so
much more plump larger my lipstick
always seems to go on better and look
nicer and yeah you can just really
transform the whole face I think by
having your lips looking plumper and
more beautiful your favorite liner yeah
this one what's it for this is Mac well
which is most people's favorites
actually if they love nude lips I love
nude lips
I always use Mac well and I'll fill in
with a slightly lighter more champagne
pink nude as I love that I love liner
I've got large lips but I've got to line
my lids to give them more definition so
they don't just look like just huge lips
on my face when I line them if something
darks like he's night moth or I use
chestnut love night mouth and they just
make such a difference for me when my
line so a million percent agree yeah so
next up I've really wanted to show you
guys this actually my I've already seen
it in a hall but it is a hack so for
those of you who might have bad hair
days which is me quite regularly because
sometimes you can't work on the weave as
much as you need to and a hat makes such
a difference and I have this new hat
from Shotwell which is two toned and you
can't always get a two-tone tat but if
you can do get one I love it so ordered
I'm just like in love with it and it
looks so nice on is it wool like felt
it's like wool and like fealty oh it's
gorgeous
automatically you go from looking basic
to looking like a little bit better
I feel really good I'd do the whole
video just sitting in this hat right now
I think you should it tells goes with
the outfit I think that'd be a bit much
do you think maybe another day
okay get our hat hair but honestly if
you're someone who you know wants to
look put together a little Russian and
you can't start your hair just throw on
a really good hat and will look amazing
yeah even if it's just a beanie as well
yeah beanies as well so nice ah some
turtlenecks yeah yeah really love it ok
my next beauty wan would be my little
gosh tricks
um actions forgot namely eyelash curlers
for me especially I have the straightest
eyelashes okay they're so straight so
for me I have to always use edge killers
but I always think people that do have
nice clear lashes always give these give
them a bit of a plump up with these and
I find that they stay all day much more
beautiful they make your eyes look more
open
I said wider you look more awake that
way so I
think most days if I am rushing out the
shops I'll throw on like some tinted
moisturizer and then I'll plump up my
eyes my eyelashes with these put on a
bit and SCARA and I just kind of look
natural but good to go I find that quite
surprising because I never use eyelash
curlers because I have really curly
lashes only and someone told me that I
should use eyelash curlers the opposite
way around to make them like straight
and out a little bit more and actually
Ray was the one who was telling me that
in his note it's my very hey girl but
she was like you know do it the opposite
way around and it will really like
stretch out your lashes if you have
curly lashes which is my like coal all
the way back it's so bad but I wish
minded we had a good friend of
everything we can enhance your eyes
amazingly okay so the next way to always
look put together is just to wear black
okay it's not about you know mixing and
matching when you don't have a lot of
time and I think if you can go and look
bright jeans or black trousers and like
a simple black shirt or polo net you'll
look good and if you can wear it with
heels as well or like booties that will
make so much difference over here I've
just got one of my favorite like black
tops and I think that if you are going
to go black you don't always have to go
you know basic and what I love is that
this is quite a simple silhouette of a
black top but it's just got this little
fur trim to add a little bit of detail
but I know what it's like when you don't
feel that confident in the way you look
if you look all black and you know your
makeups kind of laid
you're gonna look nice and put together
yeah that's very flattering in black is
another everyone looks good I'm Allison
yeah exactly especially if you've got a
lunch baby and going on right in the
middle region just put some black on and
you're look slim and trim yeah my next
one is all about brows I love having my
brows on fleek
the best way I mean I've used all manner
of products to do my brows but the best
one I always go back to it's literally
just a part of like wax eyebrow like
pomade yeah add a brush because I think
if you get yourself a really good have
you got this um yes but I have like
loads of them this is what I always use
for my brows I agree a medium for
totally this is a bobby brown eye
definer and it's quite a rigid set of
bristles so you can really start to form
the shape of little tiny eyebrows when
you draw it in so I find this just makes
your eyes look so much more on point we
eyebrows I honestly would hundred
percent recommend getting yourself like
floor wax pomade and a really nice rigid
brush and your eyebrows will always be
on fleek do you have a recommended
pomade yes
which ones you will I have three that I
kind of rotate with my main one I love
at the moment is to show show Armani
Brown maestro alright all the wise the
illamasqua brow pomade is brilliant
young swallow see aunt Stasia okay this
one I just started using that one and I
use Mac dip down as well which is really
good but people were talking in my last
video that I don't there's no drugstore
version I've not shown them a drugstore
version I was wondering if it is a
drugstore but wax it if you use I've not
seen it
they all have pencils yeah I've not seen
them and I think now like um I'm sure I
got after a song in the day I don't know
actually sorry if we find a
recommendation I'll put it in the
description bar yeah below there must be
a good one then I must be surely yeah
but to be honest even if you did buy a
more high-end one they last forever
forever and over a year oh yeah easily
over a year so my next way of always
looking put together is a beauty way and
it's got to be wearing darker lipstick
now if you're someone who like no matter
what your skin tone is I do feel like if
you put like a dark red or dark plum for
some reason if the rest of your face
isn't done it makes you look nicer and
usually when I'm you know going out
without any makeup on the eyebrows an on
fleek but I will always care
lip gloss or a lip balm or lipstick
which is in a darker color along with
the lip pencil and then wear sunglasses
it makes you look like you know what she
looks like she's got makeup on even if
you don't also never go out we just like
bare crusty lips and everything like
that like make some effort put on a dark
lipstick you look good yeah I totally
agree totally go with that like a red
lip plum lip pull always made it always
like elevates a face but if there's a
bit of color on it so yeah and some
sunglasses I love that too it you got
some sunny see your lips oh you look
fine I do that all the time but when I'm
being really lazy I'm like Pat got it
the next day and then I don't yeah I
love that my fourth one is to always
have a little tiny perfume sample in
your purse I just find if you're aren't
about even other two but you've been
rushing around everywhere if you just
have a little perfume with you spritz
yourself it can just totally elevate
your confidence make you feel like oh I
feel good again I smell amazing
I just totally find it makes you feel
completely different I think it's the
best idea if you smell good you look
good like when a girl walks past you you
know you smell so good
yeah and you can just always top up yeah
exactly and there are so many of these
little tiny little bottles this is see a
lot of modern music I've got in my purse
at the moment but there are so many
little tiny ones who can pick up like
Viktor and Ralf do them in Sephora a
little tiny ones you know and just have
it in your purse for any time you need
it where did you get that from actually
because I've not seen these are seen
ones that you can dispense your own
perfume so travel ooh have one where you
can dispense it oh yeah so you can
dispense it but I've not seen where the
brand has done it yeah well this one was
in like a little gift pack that got in
New York clearly and it was from opening
I've ever been to opening ceremony yes
yeah when I bought something there they
had these little Estee Lauder gift packs
and it's in there okay fine I'm sure you
can pick them up lots of different
places especially around Christmas
actually yeah oh love is the last pack I
think that's super buff so finally when
it comes to looking put together isn't a
particular thing but it's a concept
which is
uniforming and I've seen other people do
this well you basically look at basic
combination
so say it's a white shirt and black
trousers it might be denim and denim it
might be a a line skirt and a box T so
rather than always having to thinking
about what am I going to wear today
think today's a uniform day and I ever
just go with like the all the same color
or all the same silhouette and I think
that really does help you look put
together I think that if you're rushing
sometimes you can put 10,000 things on
and just look like a hot mess but
actually if you always have in your head
like okay it's a white shirt and jeans
kind of day I love that idea I'm always
just a white tee blue jeans okay exactly
good white tee blue jeans yeah a perfect
example universe lik exactly exactly and
then you can put heels with that or
trainer yeah and look good it look come
to completely different out yes yeah fit
like day and night I love that so much
okay so my very very last one would be
my ankle boots so a good pair of ankle
boots I would say most days if I'm in
Russia I want to get out the house I
will throw on a pair of skinny jeans and
a pair of just taller than ankle boot
that would be my recommendation there
are so many types of these boots on the
market but if you get one that's just
higher than ankle it means you can
properly tuck in whatever pants you're
wearing whatever trousers or leggings
and you won't have them riding up you
don't get that cold air in between the
two and it's just a little bit unsightly
I think I think it makes your legs look
shorter when you have the gap so get
them slightly hot like higher than ankle
length so you can tuck everything in and
just look super slick and sleek yeah and
these boots are to die for them
absolutely gorgeous I hated them and I
was like I like I need them you need
like I need that honestly I haven't
taken off this so comfortable as well I
love them we just been talking about ice
