yeah hey guys welcome to my channel look
who we have here
we've got Victoria lovely to see you
again and you the last time we filmed
together was just over you yeah a whole
year ago a whole year ago and I had a
secret bun in the oven
can you imagine I can't believe how long
it was but she is back here today and we
wanted to do a Fashion Week with you
basically basically the truth behind
Fashion Week and I don't know how many
of you guys actually follow Victoria but
if you don't you definitely should do
because she's an amazing blogger here in
the UK and you always do Fashion Week
and you do it very very well thank you
I don't even do it as regularly as you
do this season I am I was like yes I
want I want to be out there but
Victoria's always out she's always at
the shows always taking pictures and
very consistent with it and I felt like
it would be nice if we did a video where
we talked about the truth the truth
behind Fashion Week to give you guys a
little bit of insight because I feel
like sometimes Fashion Week comes across
as a little bit exclusive or a bit you
know special I mean it is special but
it's quite accessible for everyone and
we thought we'd just kind of share its
like what it's about so yeah we're going
to give you ten truths by Fashion Week
so the first truth is that a lot of
people actually borrow clothing for
fashion me yeah so you probably see
people wearing like massive designer
items or really amazing clothing but a
lot of the time they're borrowed from
either PR yeah press or they're gifted
items and they give them back at the end
of the season is it something you've
ever done before
um no and again I like lends samples if
it's like really incredible like an
incredible bag it would cost me like
two-and-a-half grand otherwise it is
actually really nice to do that so that
you're not kind of spending a fortune
every little season and it means that
especially if you like a blogger as well
and you like to show off lots of
different pieces on Instagram it means
you're not spending a fortune no I get
every outfit different yes so I know
lots of people probably think my these
girls have got like the money it's well
these there's
and stuff and it's like actually we get
stuff borrowed to us and we give it back
at the end of the season yeah no it is
really really helpful to do it that way
it just means that you guys can see kind
of everything that's on offer and it
means it doesn't cost us an absolute
fortune but we can kind of show you the
best things and how to wear them and
just inspire you that way yeah I love it
inspiration all around yeah so the
second truth is that whilst you might
see all these really glamorous women
kind of tottering around another
beautiful heels all day
in fact they quite often will have like
a pair of flats or pair of trainers
stuffed inside the bag or in like a
second bag somewhere yeah just so that
after the show or right before the show
you can quickly slip on the heels and
then slip out with them as soon as
possible yeah it's very true I do that
you know even for work and stuff I've
always done that and the funny thing as
well it's not just the shoes it's also
make jackets and stuff and now that this
season's hot I've got a really nice
jacket that I'm gonna wear but it's
probably too hot living in it so I'm
gonna like take my pictures and I'm
gonna like fling it off somewhere as
well yeah but it's basically that you
kind of get dressed up you know that
pictures taking and stuff like that but
you know you're gonna be running around
quite a lot so everyone's got like a
little second bag with other stuff in it
that they're actually wearing to be more
comfortable you know when you see those
ladies in their high heels don't think
they're wearing it all day yes so the
next truth is that it might look like
doors are being invited to these amazing
shows because they're so fabulous and
amazing and the designers just want them
there but actually a lot of people asked
to go to the shows and if you are a good
blogger or a good you know press person
what you do is you go out to PR
companies and you go out to the
designers and you ask around to get to
shows nobody just says here you go here
invites to shows the legwork that a lot
of girls do to get to shows is quite
intense there's a lot of schmoozing and
just finding out you know who's the PR
who's the contact how do I get to go to
this shows yeah like there is a lot of
legwork like when I first started
blogging and I didn't really understand
how people went to Fashion Week
yeah and then I started to
realize that you have to kind of reach
out to them send them a lovely email
tell them about yourself tell about your
blog and why you don't like to attend
and what you'd like to get out of it and
quite often they're but they'll be so
lovely and black oh yeah I would love
for you to come along
some people don't don't have enough
seats for you so you can't go to that
show that season but yeah it does kind
of look like everyone gets invited to
everything when in fact they have done a
lot of work to try and get there yeah
and I think the good thing is that if
you are someone who might have something
to offer such as a skill or you might be
able to promote the show in a way and
you reach out to the right person they'd
be more than happen to probably get you
go to the show the an adjournment I
thought that fashion meet was something
that was really exclusive and really
special which it is it yes but there's a
lot of legwork and if you ask around
you're going to show okay something next
truth is that whilst you might see some
your favorite bloggers or favorite
Instagram is going to like the Berber
show or the Julie McDonald show or
Anaheim our show there are a lot of
other shows going on from my independent
fashion designers very upcoming
incredible designers that don't get
quite as much promotion because they're
not as kind of established at that point
so if you are kind of enough for coming
bloggers or you have a really great
Instagram and you want to go to Fashion
Week you could probably still go out but
to maybe some more independent shows the
smaller shows get your content that way
and you kind of build it up that way
yeah if you want to go to Fashion Week
because you love fashion and you love
clothing seeing those designers is a
great way to come up through the ranks
and they should never be dismissed yeah
definitely right so this have a little
bit of a juicy truth and it's actually
that a lot of people don't necessarily
go to shows and they stand outside of
shows or find out where shows are to
just get their pictures taken and do you
know what yeah exactly
perhaps you're gonna get packed and I
don't think there's anything wrong with
it if you have a desire to get one to
the Daily Mail or into the magazine or
newspaper and you want to get your name
out there girl do your thing if you want
to go out there and be packed it's fine
and it's quite fun you'll see that
people outside the show and then when
people go into the show that person like
walking the other
Ian Allen yeah you're coming in and
there's nothing wrong with that I've
done it when I was you know a smaller
blogger and stuff and even now like this
time shows I didn't get invited to but
you know I want to go outside see who's
that little picture takers good spotting
as well yeah so let's like huge
Instagram us are bloggers that go and
see them yeah even take their picture as
well
yeah Street styling as well it's nice
it's you know there's nothing wrong with
it but it's definitely a true some
people are not actually going to the
shows and they're just trying to get the
pictures taken yeah okay so we were talk
about the fact that fashion shows
whenever you see them on kind of like
Vogue a some Instagram everything they
look like they're kind of its massive
spectacle where in fact there are about
five to ten minutes long each yeah
there's a huge buildup everyone is
literally queuing outside for like 30
minutes you get in and then you sit down
for about 10 minutes and then you're out
again yeah
so it's over pretty quick yeah it's
slowly surprising I used to watch
fashion TV it was called F TV on my sky
I don't as I'm like free view and they
used to have like runs and runs of
fashion shows and I was like wow there's
how is the fashion show but it was just
like my piece I stopped and I used to
think that you know shows like half an
hour or something five to ten minutes
there's a lot of buildup and these
designers work for you know six months
yeah on the collection and in ten
minutes it's like yeah over and done I
mean it's amazing minute it's like music
the lights everything that you have to
be edible yeah it's just so quick and
then you're on to the next show yeah
it's crazy
yes some people definitely dress up to
get attention during Fashion Week you
might see a lot of crazy outfits and
outfits that people wouldn't normally
wear in their day to day but because
they want to get their pictures taken
they do this it's well known you know I
don't know have you ever done it before
not really you know like peacocking
isn't it yeah no I have never really
been that outrageous I would wear
something so spectacular yes I notice I
generally just go with my own
yeah but you do see it a lot definitely
a lot and I think it's to be quite a
confident person to do that as well I
like I always do the opposite opposite I
usually under dress for Fashion Week
because I don't want to look like I've
tried to hide yeah hard but I stopped
doing that as well because I was like
you have to make some effort but I think
there's also a difference between kind
of dressing yourself up and being really
high fashion yeah and also going like to
the outrage of six gems like some people
like feathers I'm yeah I'm like full
leopard print outfits and like you know
like stuff that would get on the Daily
Mail yeah yeah worries I think we just
go like extra fashion we like yeah just
a little bit sure but you know what do
your thing if that's what you want to do
you want a peacock we're all for it we
love it we definitely look and we're
like goguardian a juicy one we've got
our notepads here like we have a little
chinwag about this so this one is that
where you sit can be political and I'm
gonna be the naughty honest a like if
you're sitting in front row you're
obviously you've made it you know you're
at the top of your game and if you're
like standing at the back you just feel
like so embarrassing it's a whole bird
person ever and the reason why we can
say this is cuz we both stood at the
back we'd been the girl who's like can I
sit front row like would be fine like I
stood at the back at shows and I do find
that the more you go to Fashion Week and
the more people know you the more likely
you are to get you know front-row seats
yeah this season we're both sitting
front row right Julia McDonald which it
was like really really lovely honest
amazing alright it's incredible absolute
credible I mean even just getting in and
even if you stand there yeah it's a
massive honor I mean they're fairly any
ticket even to stand in the whole room
it's an honor to be there so it's
incredibly acceptable yeah but there are
politics about it
don't tell me people feel a bit smug in
some cases and then the feels a bit like
be still Tayyab up yeah it's very funny
and it's like when you like go on your
front row you see like yes okay like how
do I get
but it's a really nice evening and but
at the end of the day if you're gonna
see a show you've got to see a show and
you're happy once the music starts and
the gods are walking and you see all the
beautiful clothing it does make you feel
inspired yes amazing yeah but the
politics is real
have you seen any celebrities like fight
over seats or anything before do you
know I feel like I've seen people been
moved
yeah yeah I've seen that definitely like
will you get up so this person can fit
and then other someone else gets moved
and then they look on the face it's like
why are they taking my seat as a sign
that a lot awkward moment yes for a
drama - tag so yes so in some cases when
you're kind of waiting for show you the
sat down wait for show for like 30
minutes can you thinking I'm pretty sure
it should start by now usually it's
because they're waiting from massive
celebrity to arrive or like a big editor
so safe like Rihanna's Honore Oh Rosie
huntington-whiteley run away or even
like the Vogue editor at 100 Sherman is
she's on her way
Oh Anna Wintour yeah you will be waiting
until they arrive yeah and they what
people will hold up a show till that
celebrities there because obviously the
designer wants that celebrity to be
sitting front row to be seen sitting
front row and looking at the collection
and it's quite important it's not just
about the clothing it is about who's at
that person show so there is a little
bit of politics
oh yeah to it and obviously if you've
got you know Rihanna coming you you're
gonna hold up the show anyway until she
turns up yeah everyone can yeah and then
sometimes like the celebrity doesn't
turn up and then it's a bit so finally
the last thing we're gonna say is that
Fashion Week is for absolutely everyone
and you don't necessarily have to be a
show going or have tickets to go you
know when we first started we thought it
was you know a very exclusive thing and
I remember you know messaging like Sammy
and Shirley and the girls might be gonna
go to Fashion Week I'm like maybe we'll
try and pop down and see you know see
what we can do and stand around and hang
around and there's nothing wrong with
there and if you know a couple of tips
and tricks
things he's mentioned you could actually
go to some really good shows as well but
sometimes it's nice to just be part of
the atmosphere
it's like Brewer Street the brews like
yes Soho anyone can go I had no idea
like when I first started blogging I
thought it was like ticketed completely
to get in and then you could go to any
show you want to kind of in that I had
no idea how it worked
yeah and then when I found out that it
was literally kind of free-for-all and I
can go along and watch this time outside
I was like oh my gosh that completely
changes it you know if you're like a
photographer or a blogger like aspiring
blogger
it's so good to go and it's been spired
and definitely as well definitely and
you end up making quite a lot of friends
because there's people who I you know I
admired and saw and I've like oh my gosh
I can be a big fan of yours and then you
become friends it's a nice little way of
networking as well just being around
that applet of fashion and people and
it's totally open for everyone to go to
so I definitely think it's worthwhile
checking out London during Fashion Week
yeah definitely
go along alright guys we are finished I
hope that inspired some of you guys and
you like to see Victoria again on my
channel it was lovely to have you thank
