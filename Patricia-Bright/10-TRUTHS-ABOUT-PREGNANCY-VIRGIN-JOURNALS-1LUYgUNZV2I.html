you feel sick they punch they shiver
they hiccup it's nice have some big old
pillows guys welcome to my channel so
today I've got another version journals
and I thought I'd make today a special
one because number one I have reached
seven hundred thousand subscribers on
this channel and I just want to say
thank you guys so so so much I feel like
I've been to YouTube for like over five
years now and it's always been a hobby
now you know something I do long-term
and you know we've been on this steadily
growing this whole time and it's just
the benchmark and everyone's been
telling me about it so thank you guys so
so much
- it's Mother's Day on Sunday and I was
like okay this is super relevant to like
you know this time of year so I don't
know why wouldn't do it and three I know
I've been a little bit wound about you
know being pregnant and stuff I didn't
really want to talk about it because I
don't really want to focus on the fact
that I'm about to be a baby mama I
didn't want to focus on that and and you
guys know what I'm like I come all about
beauty fashion and all that kind of
stuff on this channel but why not I
wanted to do something special for you
guys today I want to give you the
lowdown and the truth behind pregnancy
and I mean this is just ingest okay but
these are maybe some of the things that
you don't know that maybe you should
know so number one you need to we all
the time and I'm talking about before
you even know you're pregnant that
you're waking up in the middle of the
night three or four times like needing a
Wii you're talking you need to be you're
walking you need to have a Wii and
basically if you need to we you just
feel no shame it's like is there a
toilet hit excuse me I'm pregnant
I need a loo like Yuri knowing where the
toilets going to be is imperative when
you are pregnant and it's one of those
things when you never thought that you
would have like a weak bladder you feel
like you know old people have wheat
BRABUS and are pregnant people have weak
bladders and you know there are times
that I have you know had a little
trickle and everything come down my leg
and you can't really do anything about
it so
weighing is definitely real when it
comes to being pregnant so number two
your hormones a genuine me play havoc
with you and I was never someone who
suffered from like PMT or anything like
that I'm I always kind of like roll my
eyes at people like oh my hormones or
something I'm like what are you talking
about but this ish like always will have
you acting crazy happy sad but it's
insanely achieve what they do to you and
you feel like you're a different person
every single day and like in the early
stages I basically went through angry
mama bear stage and I was very like you
know clothes which I'm sure those of you
guys realize I was really close and very
protective like doors many questions
like real quick snappy I snatch your
head off with my words real quick and I
really equate that down to the hormones
words now I'm like in my like happy
bubbling stage I'm like please stay like
this please stay like this and but I
also had like really bad down times as
well like you would not see me I was
like hovering like some hermit in a cave
so the hormones really genuinely play a
number on you and it's definitely
worthwhile just being aware of that and
telling people around you you know so me
it's just the hormones so number three
what's a funny right my Americans don't
call Fanny's funny is what we call
Fanny's Fanny's and Fanny's is basically
the vajayjay and I basically have said
what's a funny because I don't know what
it looks like anymore you know when you
don't have a belly in front of you you
can look down and see your lovely
beautiful you know V area but now I
haven't seen my friend looking downward
for actually a long long time and if I
want to see my Fanny I basically need a
mirror and it's one of those things you
don't realize you're going to miss until
you're like how do I see what's going on
them how is it looking right now but you
actually need a mirror to see your Fanny
and that's the one thing I'm gonna be
really exciting like I have my baby
obviously I'm really happy to like have
my baby and I'm like happy to see my
Fanny's
yes a number for your boobs get really
big I'm sure lots of you guys know this
you get lovely big pillowy boobs but not
only do they get big they get painful
they get veiny they change color and
they just become quite heavy and a
support bra is a really real I have to
wear a bra to bed I would probably wear
a bra in the shower if I possibly could
but you genuinely need support because
they become so big and so heavy and just
you can feel them like stretching and
like the veins are just like their what
about you fit them like saying that
hello I ready for milking it's nice to
have some big old pillows in the same
breath you know you don't let anyone
touch them because you're like no babe
no away from the boobs so number five
getting up and out of anything like a
bed a chair a car a cinema C is
basically a two-man job I'm not going to
lie to you that I literally look like a
whale getting out of anything I'm like
doing and are in a every time I move I
literally look like a joke like it said
I don't want people to see me getting
out the car I need like a veil to get
out the car because I get out like
Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon I just
look ridiculous when I come out of a car
especially because I've got a lowrider
car we are changing our car because I
just like this is not practical for
anybody no and even in the middle of the
night I'm not going to lie that I have
had to like lean on Mike and roll over
I've had to hobble to the loo and him
kind of help me up so you definitely
need people to like lean on where you
want to move because you get you know a
couple of aches and pains and you lose
your center of gravity so that kind of I
can do it myself
mmm yeah number six you don't get big
for a good world you know when you think
of pregnancy you feel like you're going
to have you know a big pregnant belly
blah blah blah at by five months I still
really wasn't showing
that I was pregnant and even five to six
months so that mindset of you know what
you're gonna have a really nice big
belly like no it really doesn't happen
to like the later dates and then you
basically pop and I pop probably about a
month and a half ago maybe two months a
guy popped basically but yeah you have
no belly but what it is is that you kind
of go through like a bloated stage where
you you know you're pregnant you feel
like you're bigger but you kind of
aren't that much bigger and then it can
be a little bit awkward I remember like
going away and just feeling like I look
bloated but I'm not and I didn't know
what to wear and so I was wearing really
baggy stuff so that I wanted to look
either not pregnant and bloated or like
look really really pregnant but once you
do get that big old belly you can
definitely wear it with pride because
you don't have the suck in or anything
anymore so having that belly kind of
makes you feel like yes I'm an affirmed
pregnant woman the maternity clothing
game in the world right now is not
strong for some reason they make
everything look like some form of tent
or grandma star and I was just like no
I'm not wearing it I do definitely have
maternity jeans but maternity dresses
and tops of they're not my things so for
me when it's come to maternity style yes
I've got skinny jeans and I wear normal
pencil skirt I put like a long top over
in pebbly a size 10 I'm normally a size
8 a size 10 or a size 12 just to give me
that oversized baggy law but the
maternity clothing game isn't strong
number eight you are not the only
pregnant person in the world or in your
relationship or in this situation I feel
like my husband is also pregnant he gets
pregnancy pays and frustrations and I
feel like what it is is that your
emotions kind of rub off on everybody
else and you really do have to be quite
considerate of the people around you
because everybody becomes so honed into
you that sometimes they don't look after
themselves like I'm not going to lie to
you my mom has been cooking for me every
single day
I'll Pat lunch okay when I was a kid I
didn't get Pat lunch but now that I'm an
adult who's expecting a child
I get Pat lunch oh my gosh my mom is
enjoying pregnancy as well so just be
aware that you know lots of people
around you are going to feel the same
things that you feel maybe from an
emotional perspective being in labor is
not the only pain you're going to fill I
thought that you know during pregnancy
like oh it's all fun and games
lalala whatever and then when you give
birth you know it's are we when you give
birth the amount of alleys that I have
faced have been really real from pelvic
girdle plane or SPD as they call it so
because you are getting bigger you
release a hormone called relaxing which
basically makes all your ligaments in a
bit looser and so what it means is that
you kind of tell this news position you
might get back pay you might get groin
pain you might get leg pain and simple
tasks becoming a little bit hard
I had a fibroid as well again because of
the hormones because I had an increase
in I think it's progesterone or whatever
I don't know one of the hormones and
then cause a fibroid to grow and that
was like insane and painful you know I
broke my bone because I was trying to
protect myself and I trip up all the
time you just get lots of aches and
pains I'll be honest with you so and I
mean it's amazing and it's totally worth
it but don't just think if okay it's all
plain sailing until you give birth
because there's a lot of things that
happen in between including
breathlessness like even talking now I
like taking deep breaths morning
sickness should basically be called
all-day sickness and not that you vomit
and get on with your life you basically
feel like you're constantly going to
vomit you constantly feel sick smells
make you feel sick people make you feel
sick moving makes you feel sick
sometimes you don't even be sick and
that's the worst thing you feel like you
need to be sick but you can't get it out
that you just feel constantly nauseas
and it's not just in the beginning some
people have it throughout their
pregnancy I definitely had it for about
two to three months and then
had bouncing it coming in and going away
that kind of thing now it's not so bad
like thank God but honestly it's that
constant nausea feeling it's just gross
so baby kicking is cute but they don't
just kick they punch they shiver they
hiccup
they kind of like vibrate they stretch
they elbow they do all kinds of things
and there is nothing like feeling your
baby move inside you and then it's like
it's almost like a sense of comfort like
you know baby's alright and then you're
like do you wanna do on a relaxed that
don't know what party I wasn't invited
to but you might want to just take a
chill pill and I definitely have those
moments especially when I'm sleeping I
like this child's doing some form of
Dance on the inside of me but right now
there should be no doubts and they
should just be sleeping so the kicks are
cute but there's flips vibrations kicks
and punches and they're all going on
inside of you and you can see them from
the outside as well so you know you'll
be like calling your friends like have a
look at what this child is doing right
now and use you as soon as you call
someone to look at the baby stops that
happens all the time is that you don't
actually have to get fat during
pregnancy or you don't have to eat for
two or gain lots of weight and I know
there are women who would you were
generally worried about that and I was
one of those people I'm not gonna lie
you know
I'm a little bit vain and I you know I
care about the way I look him I did not
want I wasn't ready for that body change
and I feel like in the beginning I felt
like I had changed so much and I didn't
look any different but actually gained
quite a bit of weight in the early stage
and then it's just kind of stopped but
this theory of eating for two is totally
totally false if you say only ate for
one or didn't even eat a lot your baby
would just do all your nutrients and
you'll be really unwell but you don't
need to eat for two at all I would just
say eat your normal diet that you always
be and 200 calories more which is
basically like half a mil oh I think
it's like a nutri bar or something like
that that's all you basically need
in pregnancy and then just keep your
greens and all the fresh food really
really up there and then you can
basically lose you know afterwards you
can turn up and I've been looking at so
many women I know you also the Teyana
Taylor snapback and the Sarah stage oh
Lord
these women I speaking to someone they
said these women are doing the rest of
us women a disservice because they snap
back better than before they were
pregnant I'm hoping that that is my
portion in Jesus name the next thing is
that having a baby doesn't have to stop
you I mean I still do lots of work if
you watch my vlog channel and maybe if
you know I do outside I love working I
think that was one of my biggest fears
it's like this thought or slowing down
it's like slow down and that yes you
might have to change the way the way you
work but it doesn't have to stop you you
can be you pass so so much more
Plus this sense of creativity and almost
urgency and passion that you've got
something coming in you don't have to
feel like it's a limitation I did say
that I did feel like worried that it was
going to take for me but I felt I
realized that like for instance after
getting married you know people that are
like you know you get married you're
locked down I was like my life changed
ten times for the better like it got so
much more exciting so much more creative
I did so much more I feel like the exact
same thing applies to when you have new
life and new love in your life
you get to basically explore and get be
creative and have more fun and it's like
a Z or like an urgency that you've got
someone something coming on the way that
you've just got to and give your all to
so do all you possibly can and I felt so
much more inspired which is I've been
filming so much I do loads of videos and
doing my vlogs and do my blog and
everything and it's just literally been
in the last few weeks in the last few
months that I just felt like come on
girl we got baby grace on the way
finally pregnancy as a rare and
beautiful experience with all these
things that I've just said they sound a
little bit Nega
- but I'm telling you that the whole
thing will outweigh like the fact that
you get a baby at the end it's
definitely not all roses and I'm not
going to see him pretend like it is
because it's not but you know knowing
that you'll have you have a life at the
end of it makes so much difference and
to all the mothers out there I know
you've been through it I know that some
of you had amazing pregnancies some of
you crazy pregnancies some of you have
had pregnancies that haven't necessarily
gone full-term but hopefully your
blessings have arrived and will come and
yeah I just wanted to kind of do a video
today that was reflective of the process
of you know pregnancy so you guys out
there can appreciate your mothers all
the things that they're going fuchs it
made me appreciate my mama a lot more
and that's basically it so guys I hoped
you enjoyed that video and I didn't
scare you or put you off or anything or
maybe it just like filled you with some
excitement but I wanted to do something
that was a little bit personal to my
current situation and I think that's it
I will have another virgin journals next
week so just tell me what topic you want
me to talk about and think about talking
about finance to be completely honest
with you but we will see so let me know
in the comments thumbs up if you enjoy
videos like this and then if you have
anything else to say or shout out to
your mom or anything like that then
definitely do because I totally
appreciate it so thank you guys for
