hair anymore
my eyebrows are not on fleek Dre they
are not on fleek it hurts everything
here this is it sorry from the title you
probably know what is about to go down
yes I'm going to do the hundred layers
and I've seen the foundation and that
just made my skin itch I have seen the
fake tan I'm already as brown as
necessary and I seen the lip ones as I
said not short so when I haven't seen
yet but it's probably been done is a
hundred layers of eyebrows yes girl
yes let's see if we can get my eyebrows
licking on free on fleek with the
hundred layers so right now these are my
eyebrows that kind of already done but
we're gonna we're gonna be real about it
and I'm just gonna take my eyebrows all
off and we're just gonna start from the
bottom and let's see where we arrive so
this is about to mess up my makeup
because I actually really like for
makeup today but you know the things
that we do although I already look
greatly the things that we do for the
internet got us out here put in all
kinds of chemicals on our faces let's
not have it looking down like crazy and
I've got one two three four five
different brow products I have brow gel
I've got my our pencil Maybelline brow
pencil I've got a brow powder from Barry
M and I have a brow gel from Anastasia
Beverly Hills so I thought if I get
bored I will switch it up as well let's
start off first with the brow gel layer
number one
this router is amazing there layup
number 2 I feel like I've got to let
them dry between layer 3 you look really
to be nice in number 11 though 23 and a
cup of tea is necessary and I'm going to
move on to just using the gel now
because it's long switching to lightning
this should be like a makeup look very
vine
if in music are they getting closer and
closer together you can't even see my
actual eyebrow hair anymore they have
disappeared they've been pasted all the
way down for you one oh god it's so
thick it's so thick the thing I hate the
most is that I'm using all this product
I'd love my eyebrow gel just be wasted
fifty halfway there dies is this going
to unify at some point in time I feel
like it will other things I feel like
I'm wiping off the product with the new
product because there's so much more
that it can't handle it anymore and it's
like no 53 it's so thick what did you
get this thick initially they were
looking quite nice and now they're just
looking ridiculous but for layer 10
hasn't yet go like this but right now
I'm just I'm just not I'm just not the
one that my eyebrows are not on fleek
Dre they are not only not 60 now all
right but I've almost done look how much
product have you it hurts
everybody let's do this come on
five oh it's in my hair this is a name
Goomer there's nothing to brush there's
nothing to put on least I can get the
texture brush with this movie okay so
every last bet you guys my face
8281
sure it's a mirror it doesn't look that
bad
86 every time I try to eat enough I'm
just ruining it let's do it neatly oh it
hurts it feels so heavy
who knew eyebrows could feel heavy
Scituate taste it's like an eyebrow
treatment on fleek Trisha on fleek 100
we did it guys we did it we got a
hundred layers of eyebrows on fleek yes
yeah I think just for the fun of it I'm
gonna conceal them and try and make
these look respectable let's just see so
I've just added a touch more lip gloss
and conceal these bad boys and I
actually would say I'm ready except if I
hand over ha gasping like horrified I'm
sorry but these are fly like yeah slay
what they do they just need a bit of a
speedy though just to neaten them up to
just the touch no bit thick of it again
in there there you go there you go there
you can actually see the thickness like
I hope you can see how I'm going to come
in there's anything that was meant to be
eyebrows on fleek this is it
this is it is this making your skin it
just making my skin itch and make me
feel really strange actually it makes
you feel just look especially that bit
the texture is just in it's just awful
so guys yeah 100 layers of eyebrows yeah
you would you do it would you
I don't actually feel that my eyebrows
can move right now all right now let's
get let's just get rid of all of this I
don't think one white will do my
eyebrows I see oh look kind of looks a
bit like but you know what mmm do you
have a full naked when you take your
eyebrows off I actually feel like
tripling naked now of what a mess I
think no eyebrows is actually nicer
trying to work right now looks so
strange about it right this actually
feels so so much but I like back to
normality it's actually quite easy to
get off oh gosh so I'm going to be
working off eyebrow gel for a while guys
that is it for me I hope you guys
thought that was fun and enjoyed it and
if you're gonna try any of the hundred
layers please do send me links I think
they're hilarious and I think they're
getting more and more creative so yeah
guys I will catch you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
