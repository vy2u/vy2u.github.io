tutorial or I can make up to 200 focus
on lipsticks I got some palettes from
double-oh-seven daily deals.com which is
kind of like a Groupon type site that
has got offers and they have offers on
these palettes so I got these palettes
from there and one of them is called
it's mainly Beauty category and one of
them is cheeky lips and the colors are
what they call like winter colors a
little bit brave by trying these I was
like oh my gosh they've got quite a good
selection so I'm gonna try those and
lick sure I'm not tried any of them
before so I've got these but I've got my
simple wipes and itching on-screen I'm
gonna try them all here with you and see
what we think
so that's that palette there that's the
summer palette now the thing is I think
that not every color is going to seat me
but I think there's going to be certain
colors that suit certain skin tones and
everything so let's go for the ones that
aren't gonna shoot me first
I know this one is just gonna look
insane so let me try that one on first
shocking me
that's quite nice I don't know it looks
like on camera but I'm like it's a bit
golden it's a little bit Beyonce but I
think that's quite nice I'm gonna take a
picture
let's wipe that one off this is fun I've
never done a video like this like alive
what do I think things okay fine that
one looks alright okay this one here
looks really power it doesn't look like
it suit me so let me try that one it's a
quite thick that one
yeah no I look like so now that didn't
treat me no so some of them you win some
you lose him which I knew but maybe I
put that one on too much so let me try
it a little with a little less ah ah I
look like I'm an ill right let's try
number six number one was good number
two number four not so good we'll go to
again I don't think this one will suit
me and again now it's giving me that dry
ashy lip look so that one doesn't suit
me so I'm gonna move on to number three
here which I can already feel I prefer
the way it feels it's not on that one I
think this is gonna be really nice on me
ain't that pretty I love that it is a
matte again it's not a gloss type color
but I really like that this is a kind of
color I like wearing so moving on to
number five again I can already tell
that from the texture I'm gonna like
this more I like the way the color looks
on my finger I feel like this is
definitely gonna be a me oh it's so cute
oh it's like a bubblegum pink I love
that that's a bit Nicki Minaj but a
lovely bubblegum pink was very happy
with number 5 number 5 my favorite then
the next one is the last one number 6
let's fill this okay listen feels a bit
more it's gonna be dark the colors are
winged they don't know what they look
like it's not what they look like on
that's gonna be quite dark
let's see quite nice it's quite rich
oh that's very nice I'm just hoping that
it all picks up really well but I really
like this one so in summary that was the
summer creams palette and I light number
one number five number three and number
six number two and number four no so
right Ike I'm gonna move on to the
winter creams one and see what I think
okay so this palette looks a lot more
spicy a little bit more wintry so let's
try number one which I think I'm going
to like because it seems I think the
loss I love that I didn't even need to
think too hard about applying it
absolutely lovely and it feels so
scrumptious on my lips I love this one
moving on to number two number two seems
really light it's very similar to number
one texture feel everything again I
think it's absolutely gorgeous so number
three which I kind of dug my finger into
looks like it's gonna be quite vivid
let's see how this goes that is stunning
for red lipstick that is a really
stunning lipstick them yes I like this
one so far this palette is edgy so let's
go for number four now which doesn't
seem seems more lipstick II and maybe it
might be mad it's not as glossy as those
top three again I feel like this palette
suits me so much better than that other
panic it's really cute and what I like
is that my natural lip color didn't kind
of come through underneath yeah that's
lovely I really like that one oh please
okay now I'm gonna try number five I do
feel like this this is getting a bit too
dark for me because I don't like dark
colors but it might be nicer let's try
hmm
or GZ meant to be like an orangey brown
it's quite nice my full like this is the
kind of color that makes me look old
basically and finally number six which I
absolutely detest the look of here but
you never know what it's gonna look like
on so that's it on it's not too all for
it so guys that is the end of that
random kind of what would your first
