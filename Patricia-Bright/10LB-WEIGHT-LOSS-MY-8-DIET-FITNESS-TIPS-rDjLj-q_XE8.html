sports bra mama don't beat me when you
see this video but it's all in good
reason and as it is in January I wanted
to share that I've been having a really
strong desire to work out to eat
healthier to be healthier and I started
a little bit last year but I really
wanted to share with you guys and
hopefully get some of you guys to join
me on this progress and I plan to lose
10 pounds in 3 months and if you'd like
to join me that's absolutely fine but I
wanted to share with you a couple of key
tips and that I have done to lose what
I've got so far I haven't lost that much
so far but I've definitely been bigger
than I am now but this is probably
bigger than I've been in a while and
it's not just about weight loss and for
me this is all about being fit and just
just having the body that I feel
comfortable with it and playing these
roles ok infra and you know it's about
developing routines and stuff and I've
been really wanting to work on this and
share my journey with you guys so with
that being said I'm probably going to
show you my before so I'm going on this
process and it's going to be ten pounds
in three months let's show you what I'm
starting with
I won't be honest with you I'm really
little bit embarrassed to do this but
you know what it's okay we're family
here so yeah I'm going to show you what
I look like now and then hopefully in
three months it'll be significantly
different
so guys this here all up in here is my
problem area so this is definitely the
before there were sometimes videos where
you see the after or you don't actually
see the progress but you guys are going
to see my progress and I'm going to hold
me accountable for my ten pounds and
three moves and as I release this video
and nothing but determination to
basically get there so I'm going to
share some tips on exactly how and
definitely join me and make sure you
follow my blog Patricia bright coat UK
because over there I'm going to be
tracking my progress a lot more so my
current staff are I am
rhinestones and 6-pound and I am 5 foot
4 for those who arts and my trouble
areas are my stomach and I just really
want to just work on just toning up and
being fitter because my level fitness is
a little bit o so I'm going to give you
my top tips for weight loss and building
a perfect fitness and diet regime the
first tip is to plan plan plan being
really organized you should be tracking
your progress you should be tracking
your meals you should be tracking your
workout and just be really planned and
organized I have I've got a workout
schedule and I have a menu but I've got
my menu on my blog so you can check out
what I'm eating in hard balancing out my
meals but those who fail to plan plan to
fail even if you're just writing things
in your phone and you have an alarm to
remind you to workout or remind you to
have a protein shake that kind of thing
will really help you and allow you to
maintain your consistency so you don't
have to put those chocolate well you
probably need to put the chocolates away
to be honest if you are trying to start
a weight loss journey or a fitness
journey do not diet the reason why you
don't want to diet from all the research
that I've been doing is that dieting
actually causes your body to go into a
process of starvation and actually it
means that your metabolism slows down
you really want your body to be able to
do the hard work for you do you remember
when you were younger and you are able
to maintain quite a slim figure I was
very slim as a child even though I ate
McDonald all the time but I had a very
high metabolism and as you get older it
slows down slightly but dieting will
also cause problems to your metabolism
and make it slow down
tip number three is to eat more yes I
like this tip as I mentioned previously
metabolism is really really important so
actually the more you eat the more
you're able to increase your metabolism
now I'm not saying that you should eat
like pies and McDonald's don't eat that
kind of stuff
but eat more of the good stuff so I have
am like breakfast and have am+ have
lunch at lunch class and then have
dinner so try and eat a little bit more
and it doesn't have to be major things
it could be literally an oat cracker or
some celery stick or some carrots and
hummus and that kind of thing but the
more you eat the more body will get used
to burning all the stuff that you
consume and it means that your body is
going to be much more efficient you
tablet and it's going to be filed in the
FET for you cut out empty calories sadly
your chocolates your sodas your juices
these are all things that one aren't
going to make you feel any fuller but
are actually jam packed with calories
and actually I just add into your
glucose levels and your fat and your
carbohydrates and not the good stuff
that you really want to have cut those
out and replace them so for instance I
love sweet stuff but actually why don't
I consume berries and strawberries and
all that kind of stuff over lindo
chocolate oh and I do treat myself to
one of the day I can't stop myself but
and the more you drink maybe water
juices just forget about juices they're
full of calories and you'll get used to
it definitely and just replace these
things that are just a waste of your
calorie counter with things that are
better for you better for your body and
will increase your metabolism get those
muscles working so strength training and
high interval training anything that's
actually going to work your muscles it's
really really valuable and one I talk
about metabolism a lot because it's so
important but for every believe it's for
every pound of lean muscle you gain it
thirty calories that you burn at rest so
the great thing about having muscles and
I'm not saying you're going to become
like a muscle man builder but actually
if you're doing weight if you're doing
resistance training and you're building
your muscles when you finish at training
your muscles are still burning calories
for you absolutely amazing I just do 10
to 20 minutes of really high intensity
resistance or all muscle work in the
morning I can't run for an hour no no no
that's just far too much I've got far
too much stuff to be doing them over
take pictures of your food once you
started an Instagram is amazing you know
I love sharing my meals and into the
ground but when you take pictures of
your food you can kind of see the things
that you're you're eating what you're
putting into your body and actually
you're gonna feel virus to keep sharing
with your friends and whatever that I'm
eating burgers again I'm eating chips
again but when they're something
nutritious and valuable you're going to
feel very proud to share them I'm
actually at the end of the week you can
see yeah I've eaten
you know quite good at me I might be
able to bur don't not today or something
you need to have a cheat day
everyone needs a cheat day a day where
you basically do nothing or no exercise
or a day where you pick not that you
pick out but you eat something that you
like eating including limbo and in eat
what you want
on that day try not to overdo it because
you'll probably be you know paying for
it down the week but just eat something
that you want to or do something that
you want finally you just want to be
smart and you really want to enjoy the
process any changes that you put in if
you want them to last they are going to
be lifetime changes so if you're you
know trying to crash you can try to
style yourself and you're trying to go
with every single day like sweating away
you're really not going to be able to
last for very long think of something
that you want to implement for the rest
of your life so just enjoy the process
and I'm sure you'll meet your goals so
guys I hope you enjoyed that video let
me know in the comments what your goals
are if you guys are going to join me I'd
love to let

weekly maybe get bi-weekly session

YouTube whatever but let me know ten
pounds in a three month is it achievable
