have a hair tutorial for you and I'll be
honest with you I really do them because
I am hair lazy and if you know what hair
lazy is it means that it's like I just
need five minutes I brush and I go and I
like to keep it really simple but I
wanted to share a lot of really quick
and easy hairstyles that anyone can do
their heat free and all you really need
is a brush hairband and some bobby pins
and maybe a little bit of patience but
honestly you don't need lots of time to
do it now if you know me I do wear hair
extensions basically I go from this
length to shorter to shorter to longer
- maybe wavy but my trademark is
definitely a just a nice sleek hairstyle
that I can wear for an extended period
of time that suits me so I wear hair
extensions weaves wigs u-part all that
kind of good stuff and I do use hair
from my own collection which I have
linked in the description bar below we
have finally launched but also I'll have
some more details at the end but in the
meantime I hope you enjoy this video and
it gives you some inspiration for all my
hair lazy girls who are proud
so the first look is the faux bob for
those of you guys who don't necessarily
want to commit to the actual car and all
I basically do is section off the front
section of my hair and this is where I
will create the longer layers but also
cover up any loose or flyaway bits and
just so you know I'm just laughing at my
sister in the background cracking jokes
I basically then create a low loose
ponytail at the back which is basically
going to make the bob and then I twist
it and tuck it for dear life underneath
and secure with pins
so moving back to the front I basically
keep where my parting is and brush my
hair to work out exactly what I want it
to look like and I kind of roll and pin
those to the sides now it can end up
looking a little bit like a loop if you
haven't laid out enough hair but you can
definitely spread it apart and close up
any gaps or bring out more hair so my
next look is the fishtail braid which is
super easy if you know how to do the
braid and it's got a little bit of a
side twist going on so again I'm just
going to part my hair and I'm sweeping
all of my hair to one section of my head
and I'm separating a front section that
I'm going to create the kind of like a
side loop with now I'm not going to lie
I'm not great at explaining how to do
braids however what I found with the
fishtail braid is you basically split
your ponytail into two sections and then
you pull hair from underneath roll it
over grab it and put it onto the next
side if I can find a tutorial I will
link it in the description bar below but
I then go ahead and just kind of pull it
apart to make there be a couple of loose
hairs and to make it look and did a bit
thicker I then take my front section I
new put around kind of make a little
schlong and that's basically the look
it's really quick and easy and I think
it looks super pretty
now for my braids lazy girls I've got
the twisted front crown and this is
basically twist but it can be done with
the braid but I basically section off
the front of my hair again and I create
quite a big part and what I do is I
create a twist that goes from one corner
of my head to the other and what I keep
doing is pulling hairs from the very top
and twisting as I go
obviously this is sped up but this takes
about two or three minutes depending on
how good you are at twisting what I like
is that you get all these little loops
at the very front this is really quick
and easy to do
and I basically just put a low ponytail
but you can do whatever you want with
the bun so next is the classic milkmaid
again you do need to know how to cornrow
to be able to do this but I section off
the front of my hair and some people
have one big one that goes across some
people do it from the middle some people
like to do it from the side I prefer
myself of the side parting so I do a
small braid down one side and I go ahead
and carefully use a braid at the front
and again I am wearing hair extensions
so I do try and be careful to avoid
track exposure but I've been doing this
for a long time so kind of know what I'm
doing and I basically brush the rest of
my hair down and then with the ends for
my braids I just pin those back and that
basically creates the milkmaid look
so moving away from the braided looks
I've got the half hairstyles and the
first one I've got is the high bun and I
love this style but super cute kind of
makes you look like younger I go ahead
and section my hair I just do it my
fingers as well that way I'm able to
avoid like those and tracks being on
show and for some reason it kind of
really work and I just create a ponytail
right at the very top of my head like
this the higher the better and if you
just twist it you're going to get
basically a big penis on your head
however if you twist it and make a donut
bun you get a much flatter and much
rounder pony and I pin as well just to
make it in it a bit more even but that
is what I do it's quick and easy it
doesn't get cuter than the half mini a
very simple transition basically section
off the front and it's basically like
the half I bond but splitting it in two
two again it's kind of hard to find the
right position so do take your time with
this because too high looks a bit weird
too low just doesn't work and also
getting the buns to match I found to be
very difficult but pins are my best
friend basically and I pin it to create
the right shape that I want and also to
make the sides look nice and even and I
basically just twist and roll and it
works
so the simple half up is barely a
hairstyle but it's one I feel often
overlooked if you're having one of those
lazy days and you want to look like
you've made an effort simply just grab
in half of the front of your hair tying
it back neatly and just you know letting
out a few flyaways makes it look like
you've tried even if you've taken about
four seconds
so half up hairdo with a little bit more
effort is the faux hawk and all I
basically do is section a front
rectangle in the middle of my head and
this is why I'm basically go to create
the pump and the hump and I just move
everything out the way and with that
front rectangle I section it in half the
back section I use my finger to create a
roll which is going to give me the
volume but you can also use a sponge
roller i pin this into place and then
the section at the very fun I flip over
and as you can see there's lots of
volume again I go ahead in with the pins
pin everything into place to kind of
hold that hub there but it basically is
a really nice faux hawk and you can put
it into a high ponytail or are half up
hairdo but that's how I quickly and
easily create this look feel like this
old-school hairstyle has made such a
combat and it's the most easiest thing
to do again it's just parting the hair
half in the middle and having a section
at the very front which basically you
can be swooped or pinned behind your ear
and just creating either a mid to low to
high ponytail whatever suits you and
next is the bowed one I love this one
because it looks like lots of efforts
has been made but it hasn't I section
off the front and I go ahead and try and
get a really really really high bun
which is quite hard to do when you've
got tracks and everything but once I've
got it up in the middle I split my
ponytail into half and I fold it back
and pin and I do this on both sides and
it creates the illusion of a bow if you
take the end of that and flip it in the
front you can then create that middle
section that gives a bow it's kind of
Bowie look and that's basically it
so sticking with the high buns I've got
the center part and what I like doing is
just playing with different partings
it all depends on what really suits you
the most I don't usually wear center
parts but I basically get my hair into a
high bun as per usual and I just give it
a wrap and roll sometimes I create a
book donut bun sometimes I just create a
flip depending and pin everything in
place and then with the front section I
can either go for the center part or the
side part I do find if you have a longer
face that a center part suits a little
bit more and for my heart-shaped face I
usually go for a side part but just so
you guys can get a peek at that so as I
said I'm over side part type of girl and
as you can see it makes such a big
difference all I do is suction off the
front as per usual and I'm quite lazy I
basically tuck the front section behind
my ear but again it looks like lots of
effort has been made when it has in with
the loose sections I just pin those and
tie them into my top bun and it looks
just like this so my final hairdo is one
using an accessory and I just found
these in my closet as I uh I've not used
these for ages and I'm just creating a
front crown by twisting and it's really
easy to do for those of you who hate
braiding and I'm just following this
twist all the way around and I'm
following it through to my bun and it
kind of creates a little bit of a donor
and it's very very secure and it's a
great way to keep all your hair up and
look quite nice and neat I go ahead and
put this pointy crowny headband thing I
can't remember I got it from probably a
zooss but I think that looks really like
you know regal it will be great for
fancy dress but I think it's nice of
special occasions
and I also have this one which I think
looks like a Grecian goddess I love it
that is a wrap I showed you lots of
different hairstyles that I was just
being a bit creative with most of the
time I do in my hair just straight down
and really really simple because I
really do like to keep it fast free
however the
is nothing when we're getting creative
once in a while and obviously I really
want to showcase just me wearing my hair
extensions which I have finally launched
and I know I've been talking about this
will such a long time it's a big big
process to really launch up in you're
passionate about and that you really
believe in and respect so why hairs all
about buying hair by texture and not by
race lots of hair extensions seem to be
based on some kind of racial profile
from Armenian till Eurasian to to
Pomeranian to unicorn and I've always
said this and I'm like you know what I
don't want to buy hair or be sold hair
based on a racial profile but I want to
be sold hair based on how I feel and I
want my hair to make me feel so we don't
sell hair by race we sell here by
textures so you've got four different
textures which is why satin white curved
white oh and white texture and basically
it goes from really sleek to nice kinky
curly and I've worn lots of different
hair styles which you guys to see me
wear over the many different years but
basically we wanted to make buying
simple by hair by how you want to look
and how you want to feel not by I'm
confused if it is Brazilian or German
like I just didn't want that so
