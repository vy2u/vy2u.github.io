today's video is going to be the 13
personal questions tag I saw it on
beauty questions Channel and I thought
I'll go ahead and do it
I was not tagged in it though but I'm
just gonna do it anyway I'm very nosy so
I hope that other people who are as nosy
as I am so what do you order at
Starbucks
well I rarely ever go to Starbucks cuz I
don't really drink coffee that much
anyway but if I do go I always get the
mango the mango passion anything or the
the black currant one I don't like
things that are creamy base I'm much
more into you know water base things and
fruit base things like Christmas I don't
like chocolate but I like sweets that
kind of stuff okay so what's one thing
your closet that you cannot live without
that would definitely have to be some
kind of jacket or some kind of blazer
I am very cold base so I always feel
cold and I just need something some kind
of security with me that will keep me
warm so it would be a blazer yeah black
one mmm what's one thing that most
people probably wouldn't know about you
that's quite hard because people who by
the time you know me you'll know that
about me but I'm really like one I'm a
big nerd I'm just the big nerd my Connie
would tonight I like sci-fi and my x-men
and stuff like that and yeah and heroes
all those kind of things and prop her
into fantasy a lot love it and maybe I
like some death metal tunes so maybe
people who don't know that it has to be
tuned for though not just lot extreme
screaming throughout the whole song but
yeah maybe maybe that's it people gonna
tell that I'm into like systems over
down once in a while you know name one
thing that you want to do before I die
oh my gosh one thing I definitely want
to do before I die is to have made an
impact on people's lives so maybe if it
was one person that I'd love to by be
able to buy someone
and just say you know I have that house
mortgage free it's yours that's the kind
of thing I'd really want to do is just
to make sure that I help somebody else
I'll help multiple people that's like
the biggest thing for me but who knows
how I did maybe one day somehow what's
one that I food I can't live without
rice rice cake that's how you know I'm
Nigerian I can't live without rice I'm
telling you if I don't have rice once in
a week I don't know what would happen to
me I'm oh that's a when I went to New
York I was dying I was crying because I
couldn't get some nice chill off rice
and just my own food to keep me alive
and then I found out about a Caribbean
shop which was in inside Gran's the
Grand Central Station and I watched I
found out at that place I went there
every single day or I had Indian food
every single day because I love rice I
need it's nothing rifles for me okay yep
rice what quotes phrase do you live your
life by mmm beloved let us love one
another for love is of God and every one
that loveth is born of God and I've got
he that loveth not love is not God for
god is love
so yeah that's actually from that is
first John four seven eight but I love
the punx principle of love and living a
life not for yourself and for other
people just just to love as much as you
can I know I know it sounds really
cheesy but that is literally what I give
my life by what do you like and dislike
about the YouTube community okay
I like the unige YouTube community
because there's so many different
personalities some pics some people I
find inspirational for instance there is
me I'm loving me she knows I love her I
like comment on every video that she has
hey girl I put a link in the bottom bar
I love that
I'm gonna do a shout out for her there
are some people out there who are really
really inspirational giving new ideas
they're fresh and I love people who are
just real you can kind of see into their
lives and stuff like that what do I do
not like what don't I like about the
YouTube community and when everyone just
does the same thing it's just like a
trickle effect they just start copying
each other or they think that this video
is gonna be the next big video so they
just do it and I don't like that like be
natural I'm the type of person I love
the videos that no one else is doing I
there's there's people who have watch
that probably have 300 400 subscribers I
wouldn't even tell you who they are the
clothes not that I don't want to get big
but because I love them I just swipe my
little secret you know is that my secret
but yeah I don't like it when there's a
trickle effect and people copy each
other in videos just for the sake of
getting views and stuff okay
what's your most not number one listen
to someone iTunes well I don't listen to
music on iTunes but maybe that's really
a hard question but maybe I'll say there
were like certain songs that always come
up in my mind all the time and I sing
and listen to regularly one of them is
Lonnie or winsome I don't know why I
always sing that song I probably sing it
once a week and then like listen to it
once a week for that in the past five
years and then there's a song by profile
could dig in you and this came out in
maybe about 2000 and 2005 I'm telling
you you can't find that song anyway you
can't even find it on YouTube so if
anybody knows a profile what album it
was from digging you was on please let
me know I've got it somewhere stored in
my laptop I might add the laptop but
that was broken so it's hard for me to
access it what kind of star would you
define yourself as having and I don't
really have a style which is the most
embarrassing thing about me it just
depends on what the mood takes me I'd
love to have like the style I would love
to have is a very European Parisian
Italian style so clean lines and tail
in block colors because I and I still
have that I don't really like much
pattern I love lots of peach and stuff
but just sometimes I feel that being
grungy and then I will just you know
where some rock boots and you know a
leather jacket like I do it all the time
and then sometimes I feel like going
girly and being princess in princessy
and then I get inspired by Japanese
fashion and I think I'm Howard she could
go like that's my issue there isn't one
thing that define me but it would
definitely be European is the kind of
thing I like I love that clean Parisian
Italian look yeah okay my favorite
number is the number seven because it
marks completion and perfection and
beauty in my mind
so yeah number seven two pet peeves okay
okay okay let's talk about it I hate
okay it's all surrounding food okay I
have I'm like the oldest of a lot of
younger cousins right and I hate like
Kraven children children that my son can
have some you could go away long Troy
just long just actually they're just
looking at your food and not that
they've not had their own you're not
that you want the child to starve but
they're like what was that laughs I I
hate it and no one should ever do that
over my food because it has me it has me
cringing when I can see someone looking
at my place I'm actually my boyfriend
does it hmm oh don't what's that on my
plate
otherwise I will fight you and then also
a pet peeve food-related again is when
people hum when they're eating okay
something that I've got cousins who do
this and they know they do this they're
like like they're really enjoying the
food and like that will make make me
slap you please just eat quietly and
don't go mmm
gosh and people do it alone come down
with me as well
it just has me cringing inside and
guilty pleasure guilty pleasure okay so
my guilty pleasure is really gross but I
actually love popping and picking other
people's spots and scabs and stuff like
that
and it sounds gross oh it sounds gross
but literally if I see like the spot on
my sister's head or something right let
me let me get to that now she doesn't
you she won't usually let me but if I'm
getting there really quickly just can't
do anything about it I get to my mom my
dick to my boyfriend who you guys really
want to see oh yeah I know it's it's so
gross but it's so satisfying really
satisfying so guys that is it Those um
that's my 13 personal questions tag and
I hope you like that video and see later
