another girl problems video and the last
one did so so work was amazing I
couldn't believe the response basically
it lets me know that us girls we have a
lot of problems don't we girls but we
have a community kind of maker
what's it not Alcoholics Anonymous I go
whatever YouTube anonymous like guard
problems let's sort them out for them
here to do it so I'm going to keep doing
these and I'm probably gonna do these
every other Wednesdays I will do a girl
problems video so thank you guys for
leaving your comments and make sure you
leave your comments on like other girl
problems videos that you want me to do
so today's ago is going to be based on
the girl problem of strawberry legs now
I saw this comment and had like a
hundred thumbs up I was like oh my gosh
I can't remember who did it but next
time if you leave the comment and it
gets lots of thumbs up and make sure I
shout you out for sure so first of all
let me just clear up what you know the
problem is so the girl problem of
strawberry legs you guys are going to
have to give me a thumbs up for being
brave enough to show you my legs so
they've often been very self-conscious
about them in the past but here's a
little insight to what strawberry legs
actually is so that's my legs but
basically it's a case of where the hair
follicles grow out that the dots
themself like the head of the hair
follicle whatever is really really
visible so on my skin tone what you can
see are the little black dots even if
there isn't any hair growing out of it
you can see the little dots and I was
never quite sure if that's just good you
can see my hair follicle or it's in
growing hair or something I don't know
because I actually don't get very heavy
legs in general but I always have and
the dots on my leg which is so
frustrating and also I've got a whole
leaf of mosquito bites due to me not
taking care in my youth and when I've
traveled in the past I just let myself
get chewed away by musky
and scars who hasn't got scars on the
legs we've all fallen down and also dark
knees oh yeah I've got that so the holy
book problems and often loads of us want
smooth sexy in toned legs don't we
so let's come up with some solutions
let's address the whole strawberry legs
first because that's kind of a separate
issue and I think it's entirely got to
do with the kind of hairs you have and
how you shave or hair remove I believe
there are four different options for
hair removal which is hair removing
cream shaving waxing and laser hair
removal the first two I really don't
think of the best option if you have the
strawberry eggs because I really think
that they need to in growing hairs which
often leave a little dot or a little
scar or a little something that will
cause strawberry eggs if you are going
to choose to shave an amazing tip is to
use conditioner the conditioner will
smoothen and soften your hair and make
it easier when you cut and also make
your legs feel really really smooth so
the next option is waxing and I think
waxing is a great option and one it
removes the hair from the root ideally
which means that hopefully you'll get to
see less of the little dots everywhere
it stops the hair growing back as thick
I hear well that's what the rumor is
it's quite quick is painful but you know
in the long term it's worth it and
finally the next option is basically
laser hair removal this is a permanent
solution and this is what I want to do
if I can get a company to help me do
laser hair removal wink
wait great I will be definitely up for
doing that I think it's a great way to
permanently get rid of hair and also
probably get rid of all the dark dots
because you basically kill the hair from
the root so let's now get to some
solutions for more even toned and sexy
looking legs so number one is to try and
exfoliating and either bleaching as well
now I wouldn't use kind of chemical
bleachers by I'm all for a natural
lighting if you've got scars or marks
like that and I do use a little sugar
lemon
and glycerin mix on my knees I find that
lemon is a natural skin lightener the
sugar is great for exfoliating and the
glistening is great for moisturizing so
if you're not into light you know
long-term fixes bla bla bla you just
want your legs to look good and sexy now
your options are basically makeup now
I've used um normal makeup so my
foundation in the past to get my legs
looking nice and even and you know it
can be very hit or miss sometimes so I
wouldn't go for that if you want to step
up there now professional kits and this
video isn't sponsored by the way I
bought this myself but I thought I'd
really show it to you it's the Sally
Hansen airbrush um leg spray which is
amazing in terms of getting your skin
nice and even and I think it's only ten
pounds
they've got three colors so again the
color selection can be a bit iffy and
this is waterproof and is also doesn't
transform to your clothes so I can say
yeah it's really good in that way and
finally your best option is basically to
accept it honestly I don't think that
for those of you look girls who are
worried about oh my gosh what's a guy
gonna think I don't think guys actually
care I think they actually find things
and legs things or legs well legs and
scars and whatever quite endearing
because it means that we're not we're
not all perfect none of us are going to
be perfect whatsoever but there is a bit
of character with us so sometimes you
embrace it you know there are times
where I don't bother putting airbrush
spray on my legs or makeup on my knees
and I just wear a miniskirt and I get
out the house and I do my dance in the
kerb and I don't care what you think of
my legs I think Nick gorgeous so guys I
hope you enjoyed that video I do have a
really good and girl problems ready for
you for next not next Wednesday the
Wednesday after next but keep writing
your comments below because we're going
to keep coming up with more and more
girl problems and my next ones not going
to be a beauty run as well so I'll see
you later bye I mean - c'mon rule so it
really really definitely impacted me and
even impacting my friendships my friends
