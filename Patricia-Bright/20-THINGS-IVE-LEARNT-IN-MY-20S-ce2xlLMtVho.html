something that you know is really
relevant at this point of time in my
life and for many of you guys who are
following me who are probably of this
age or coming to this age and I am
basically just over halfway through my
twenties and there's so many things that
I have learned about myself and I don't
feel like I'm getting old I just feel
like I'm growing up a little bit
although forever be a big big kid but I
thought I would share 20 things that I
have learned so far now that I'm like
through my twenties and I took it to
Twitter and asked you guys about some of
the things that you felt and you guys
got all philosophical you guys are
really real with the philosophy that I
could actually do a hundred things I've
learned but I thought let me try and
summarize it as a couple of things maybe
this is useful to some of you guys so
number one your favorite artists will be
from when you're a teenager this is no
joke I hate modern music and my favorite
artists are alia Lauren Hill Brandi take
that I feel like all this music nowadays
it's so so bad take me back to the 90s
one thing that you'll learn in life is
that absolutely everybody is going to
eventually disappoint you in one way or
the other and that is because everybody
is human and so you learn to stop
relying on other people to kind of get
stuff done for you and you start to
really just realize you know what I can
do this myself you're really not going
to see your favorite friends regularly
but do you know what it doesn't matter
because when you do see them it's like
nothing has ever changed you'll go to a
bar or you go to Nando's like me and my
friends and you literally talk for four
hours talk about what's been going on in
each and every one of your lives you
don't need to speak on the phone every
single day but when you catch up it's
going to be like you've never missed a
single thing by the time you're in your
mid-20s you have friends of all ages you
can get on with an 18 year old the same
way you can get on with a 40 year old a
50 year old a 65 year old and it's so
nice to actually be in the middle where
you can interact with everyone on the
spectrum you feel young you
enough to be able to get on with like
the youngers but you feel mature enough
to also really want to hear the words of
wisdoms from the elderly you realized
that the cool kids growing up were never
that cool and actually we realized that
everyone who thought they were cool or
you know amazing and you know the top it
boy or whatever they're really like just
nothing now and actually even if you
weren't the coolest and you weren't
there most popular you're probably kind
of cool right now and they wish they
could be you life is a lot shorter than
you think before you really want it to
grow up and be old and get out of school
but actually when you're in your mid-20s
or getting into your twenties you
actually reminisce on the days when
you're in school when all you had to
worry about was exams or your crush not
liking you because you realize that life
is a lot shorter and you want to live
every single moment like it is your last
staying up late is awful who wants to
stay up late I remember as a young
person like to stay up past ten eleven
twelve Wow
special now if I can get to bed for ten
o'clock it's like ha hoo yeah it's so
exciting to get to bed early like my bed
is literally like a cup
another thing you realize absolutely
everything is expensive when you're
living on student loan or your parents
money or your pocket money you don't
have real expenses you just be buying
stuff here and there willy-nilly but
then you start realizing hold on how
much is that cause I'm one pound 50 I
think I'll say that one pound 50 thank
you very much you get good at some more
talk when you're younger you didn't
really know how to do it you are awkward
those silences but now in your mid-20s
you know that on a Monday morning the
first question you're going to ask is
how's your weekend all you're going to
talk about the weather the traffic the
travel and you brace yourself because
you know someone's going to have got
really drunk over the weekend and not
remember any of it but take 30 minutes
to tell you that story it's okay to be
who you are and not to have it all
figured out in your mid-20s it really
doesn't matter all the plans that you
thought that you had that you're
be when you are 20 more than likely
you've not achieved it but actually
you're looking at the gradual 40 and
they're still in that process and the
whole part of life is a process you can
no longer eat whatever you want this one
fills me with absolute tears you need to
work for it you know and all those roles
and those little crevices and there's
you know speckles will send you like
keep appearing you're like okay I'm
going to put that Milky Bar down and I'm
going to get myself a gym membership do
you really need to surround yourself
with like-minded people positive people
people who are better than you people
who you aspire to be people who work
hard just surround yourself with the
greatest people because actually that's
going to rub off of you
and you're going to get used to being
able to let go of the dead baggage and
the people who hold you back from
actually being the best you you can be
growing apart from old friends and
acquaintances is just a natural part of
the process embrace it and be happy with
the seasons that you spent with them and
also you're going to get new people are
going to come into your life for a
period as well what you do in school and
university really isn't going to
translate into what you do as a career
and I found that so many people you know
they study geography they are not
geography teachers okay
genuinely what you do unless you do like
a specific vocation has no reflection on
what career path you take and actually
university is about experiencing in life
and being dedicated to a cause meeting
deadlines and learning and researching
and not exactly the details of
Pythagoras's theory the night class is
not a way to get home yes you might pay
50 pounds for a taxi but it's ok you do
not want to be sitting with a guy
sleeping on your shoulder with beer
breath as the Sun is rising and you're
so tired and you are walking barefoot
home with your high heels in your hand
no 50 pound taxi is the way to go
another thing you realize that not
everyone is going to like you okay not
everyone has to be your friend not
everybody is going to be your friend but
you know what that is a hundred percent
okay because you probably don't like a
people as well it's okay to fail failure
is literally part of the process of
growing up because when you make your
mistakes you learn from them and you
totally become a better person you're
very unlikely to make that mistake again
and even if you do you'll get up from it
and you're just dusting it off in your
twenties you need to be your biggest fan
without putting down other people
sometimes growing up means growing apart
it is the circle of life
not everyone who is with you from the
beginning will be with you forever
building up to your twenties you're
going to have a load of different jobs
honestly every single job that you're in
just see it as a stepping stone and a
learning experience from working at
McDonald's to stacking shelves to
sitting in an office or being a PA every
single job you do it's going to be a
build up towards a career but it's going
to take you to where you're gonna go the
sky really is the limit hard work and
dedication truly pay off and you'll see
that the people who actually make it as
a success it's not just because they get
lucky it's actually because they work
hard and if you make the exact same
choice to do just that you can achieve
everything that you want to achieve so
guys that is 20 things I've learned in
my 20s and some of those are from what
you guys have also sent me on Twitter I
know that there are so many more lessons
that people are learning and those of
you who are even younger than that I
know you've learned you've learned from
13 to 15 or 15 to 18 so many things that
you have learned and please do share
these in the comments below because it
really does ivy them and I'm so inspired
when I read them and I know other people
do and I love having that conversation
going take it to Twitter if you guys are
not following me or take it to Instagram
as well and Facebook but I hope you
enjoyed that I've got really really fun
doing it and yeah let's keep learning
let's keep growing guys you know I love
being on this channel when doing my
chatty videos of you guys so I really
hope you enjoy and I'll see you guys
