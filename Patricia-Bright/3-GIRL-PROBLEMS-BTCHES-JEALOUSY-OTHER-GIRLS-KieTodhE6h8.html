another girl problems video this is the
third one make sure you check out my
links below for the previous ones and
today's girl problems video isn't going
to be a beauty problem but definitely a
problem that I know a lot of us girls
face growing up or even till now as
women and this is the problem of
jealousy or haters or bitches or just
you know that kind of thing that often
girls find when there are a lot of girls
and groups and they feel like it can be
a bit competitive and this was one of
the comments again that was left by one
of my lovely subscribers so for those of
you who have more girl problems leave
them below and we will be addressing
them every other Wednesday on this
channel so first of all let's just
define this whole girl problem of
jealousy generation and all of that kind
of things so often it could be a case of
you find that there's you know girls who
say things about you being a bit slide
towards you whispering about you and
just being downright mean and it's quite
common within the female gender yes the
female gender so let's talk about some
solutions towards this my first solution
really isn't going to be that appealing
to everybody but I really think is a
genuine solution but it's actually to
look at yourself first I see a lot of
girls who have delusions of grandeur and
that's why they think everybody's
jealous of them actually just take some
time time for yourself and address and
it's not nice of people to talk about
you and say oh you wear too much makeup
or go too fat or your clothes are too
tight or you're slutty or you're this or
you're that you know sometimes people
will bitch about you and say these
things but sometimes what they say could
be true are you actually a little bit
obese could you do of losing a few
pounds maybe you could maybe you
couldn't you don't care that's a
completely different story but don't you
know call people haters when it's
actually true if people are saying that
you're a bit easy maybe you are maybe
your reputation
proceeded you and they not haters and
they don't want to be like you but they
are going to bitch and talk about you
which isn't appropriate but maybe it is
true that you could be a little bit too
easy maybe your makeup is heavy but do
you know what if you reflecting yourself
and you realize maybe it's true you then
decide do you even care which a lot of
the time people don't and you don't have
to care or maybe you then say ok do you
know I want to sort myself out so that
people don't have anything to say bad
about me but you not people will always
have something prepared to say so really
don't really worry about that too much
so my second solution is one thing that
my mom's always said to me which is to
kill people with kindness
rather than stooping to their level of
being bitchy and monie and rude and
horrible be nice you know give them that
smile when they're giving you that like
oh my gosh or they're snickering about
uvula Hey like just like kind of like
I'm just so amazing but I'm just a
lovely person as well it makes you look
so much better than them and publicly
make them a bit more jealous because
you're such a happy person on the inside
but you know what it's a great way to
disperse the negative energy that might
want to go around it's really important
to consider the sources often you hear
that someone was talking about you or
they said this or they said that from
somebody right why has that person come
to tell you something is that because
that person likes drama I have I know
people who will come and saying you know
that person said this you know that
person did this you know that why are
you coming to tell me why are you coming
to ruin the atmosphere and no I do not
accept it and it might even be your
friend but I see friends like that as
enemies of progress anyone who comes to
you to tell you that somebody said
something bad about you they're not
doing it to edify you they're doing it
to basically you know they like drama
there are people out there who love
drama and don't be fooled by people who
come and tell you stuff like that
they're not your friend enemy of
progress okay consider that
so solution number four is to address
the person I only do this if one it's
safe because if they're going to like
stab you or something pull your hair or
something then don't approach them but
genuinely approach them and not enough
I'm bringing my crew you bring your crew
let's approach take that person by
themselves as it came you know what's up
what's the problem clear the air and
what you'll find is that it's over
miscommunication or just crashes up
personality and at that point in time
what you can do is take the lead and say
let's agree to disagree you don't like
me I don't like you maybe one day we'll
be friends but right now let's keep it
amicable I don't want to hear that you
said anything I don't have anything
negative tip to say about you either so
leave it up there keep it nice and
neutral and keep it classy girls don't
let it affect you so many girls become
very introverted because people are
talking about them or they hate them or
they're bitching that is what some
people want to do they want you to feel
unconfident they want you to hide in
yourself no this is not their
opportunity to win no chance do not let
it affect you if people are jealous of
you or the hating on you don't don't
even let it get in rock yourself create
your shield about you know that you are
beautiful and amazing be made nobody can
say anything if you are obese and you're
happy with it make you better rock that
fact if you do wear too much makeup and
you like that look price throw on a hell
of a lot more and let them keep talking
don't let it break your confidence don't
let them ever see that you're giving in
to it hold your head high and smile okay
because that's all you need
self-confidence and self-awareness that
no matter what other people are saying
about you they can't hurt you and that
gives you strength and actually or after
what people would just start because you
they can see that you're not even
offended or affected by anything thanks
