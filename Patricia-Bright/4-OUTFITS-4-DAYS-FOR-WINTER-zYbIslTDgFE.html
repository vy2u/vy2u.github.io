basically chilly outfits video so just a
few looks that I wear now that it's kind
of wind up getting really really cold
but some of us will still want to look
trendy and prettier at the same time so
yeah I'll put some looks together so I
hope you enjoyed the video bye guys
so my first chilly outfit is basically
featuring a statement sweater and this
is from love clothing calm and I think
most of us love sweaters or jumpers in
the cold because they are great way of
keeping you warm just pairing this
jumper with just some skinny jeans from
Topshop and some kids and I'm also
wearing and leather jacket as well
because I do find these quite warm
especially if I add a fur trim so I
really love this look I find it really
casual chic and just easy to throw on
this look here wearing another jumper
and this is the knitted jumper though
you might not be able to tell and it's a
high-low jumper
very with disco pants which I love I
find that you know it can show love
curves so that's why I like the high-low
jumper but it's able to kind of cover my
behind area
so these disco pants are groups of the
American Apparel ones but they're
amazing at 25 pounds we love clothing as
well so just to add that added warmth
I'm wearing a jewel a I love fur juillet
they definitely do keep in the world and
this is a cream one and I'm
my cross necklaces which are from a DOS
this is probably my favorite out of the
more because it's really neutral I'm
just wearing the draped leather jacket
with a gray sweater and black American
the power leggings but just feel kind of
so neutral what I've done is just
dressed up with my accessories so my
green bag is the candidate in from
JustFab top hurdle UK and I think the
color just adds that and pop to my
outfit and also my fur necklace is for
monkey on sale so I've also topped this
outfit off with a blue B so you can see
that I've done a lot of accessorizing
you really paint outfit but it just adds
some flavor
this is an outfit video for cold days
but I love shorts evening whether it's
cold I think with the right top and
loose and tights actually find a way as
a great if you're going up for dinner or
special occasion so I always say just
wear a pair of tights with the shorts
and I'm wearing a really cool pattern
pair which are from a boss and my shorts
are also full of clothing so this is how
I would wear the top but it's long
sleeves I'll be quite warm on the top I
can just wear with an leather jacket or
something can put me time having a bit
of a bad hair day somewhere my fur hat
as well so guys those are some of my
winter looks and if you were looking to
any kind of Christmas gift ideas and do
check out a video that something Robbins
and I have done on the fash tag channel
