today I wanted to do a video on how to
get your life right in 48 hours and I
know what it's like when it you are you
know working a nine-to-five you know I
went to nine-to-five I know that
struggle come Friday you've got bags and
you're not feeling amazing and I've
actually been challenged by Neutrogena
to do a 40-hour life transformation
which is basically the Saturday in the
sunday that's what you've got a couple
of days to make everything right before
Monday so guys I hope you enjoy some of
these tips and tricks that I like to do
on the weekend to make sure I feel good
come Monday so number one get your body
right by the time you have reached the
end of the week your showers have
probably been you know five ten minutes
shower barely even moisturize not giving
yourself all the loveliness that you
need so what I normally like to do is to
have a really nice long bath like one of
those bus that's like half an hour to an
hour and most of the time I only Shin
this is amazing and gives you shower in
the week so on the weekend I'll just
really take the time to indulge and to
get my body right I definitely like to
explain it I'd either use a brush or a
loofah anything that's gonna be you know
quite abrasive to just get all those
dead skin cells and basically the stink
of Monday to Friday off of me and after
that I go ahead and moisturize and I'm
using the Neutrogena deep moisture body
lotion this is amazing and gives you got
to moisturize ation and it contains
ghosts ruin and it's almost like you
know a little bit of a sinking treatment
for your skin and I like to use a
moisturizer that is heavy duty because I
do get quite ashy and normally when I
like moisturizing I get ideas in my head
and once I've had a bath and I'm feeling
relaxed and moisturized it kind of gives
me the motivation to kind of do
something so the second thing I like to
do is to declutter you guys know that
I'm the kind of person I'm obsessed with
like organization and decluttering is
like the kind of thing that gives me so
much joy on the weekend
anything from kind of sorting out all my
laundry working out you know what bits
and bobs I don't really want I always
sort out my makeup on the weekend
because
normally my makeup gets super messy and
super crazy I find that I just need to
organize it but when I buy ID cutter it
makes me feel so much better and I know
it will set you up to have a great week
ahead now after that I like to get my
mind right so you think about your body
you think about your home and
organization and then you've got to
think about your mind what I'd like to
do is actually to get some inspiration I
like to go pick up magazines magazines
shot I like to you know scroll on
different blogs and stuff but I think
the weekends a good time to get
inspiration and I would say avoid social
media I'm not saying you know they go on
Instagram and you know get inspiration
sometimes there's nothing like just
walking out of your house seeing what's
going on in your local area going to a
park just get in some inspiration will
always make you feel better about the
weekend if you spend your weekend kind
of just sitting there not getting any
inspiration not thinking of anything
besides what you're gonna do or Monday
or what happened last week or thinking
about anything outside your box you're
just gonna continue to bill it be in
another so I say get out of your house
get some magazines go to a park you have
a beer do something that's gonna you
know get you at your comfort zone
and just you know get your creative
juices flowing so we're next and final
tip is to do one thing I am the kind of
person that there's so many things that
I want to do and sometimes I just don't
get them done because I've become so
overwhelmed but if you have this concept
of just do the one thing and usually
make it the hard thing thing that you've
been you know holding back on for ages
and you keep pushing aside just get it
done be that film your first YouTube
video which is what most of you guys
always say you want to do being that put
up the shelf that you said you're gonna
put up be that you know do that exercise
regime or see that person you haven't
seen in a long time just do that one
thing in that short window of time
you've only got 48 hours on the weekend
anyway just do one thing genuinely it's
gonna make you feel a ton better for the
week ahead
and it kind of motivates you that each
weekend or each little 48-hour period
you can just do something that can
actually make a big difference to your
life
so guys I hope you enjoyed that video
and I hope it gave you a little bit of
inspiration those are a few of the
things I'd like to do if I've got a
limited amount of time or just that we
can to just sort my life out and I just
see it as a process like I know how hard
it is when you don't have lots of times
on your hand but when you've just got a
short amount make sure you use it
effectively so guys I hoped you enjoyed
and I'll catch you all later bye
you excited cuz mommy's going to a
concert</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
