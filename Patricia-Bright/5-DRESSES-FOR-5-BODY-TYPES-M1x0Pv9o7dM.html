different video for you and I'm very
excited to share today I'm going to show
you how to wear five different dresses
for five different body types now it's
amazing how we all come in different
shapes and sizes we can definitely dress
in ways that accentuate our best bits
hopefully you can see your body type
somewhere on this chart so let's get
started with our pear-shaped ladies
you're probably rider on the hip and
smaller on the bust
what you really want to do is work on
balancing yourself you can definitely
doing this by showing off your shoulders
these are a really sexy part of a woman
and are great way to balance the water
next you want to look at dresses that
drape on the bottom nothing that's going
to cling onto your hip but hang
elegantly on top of them you probably
have a gorgeous way so definitely we're
about to show it off so next is my
strawberry shaped ladies you're probably
bigger on the top half and not having
very much on the bottom so you guys are
probably gorgeous with beautiful legs
all you really want to do is create the
illusion of hid you don't necessarily
have to go a line or peplum is a great
way to create some illusion or volume on
the bottom are
so you really don't want to draw
attention to those shoulders cover them
up with some dark colors but you can get
away with show some cleavage in a round
neck so my straight up and down girls
that is fine
this is all about creating illusion so
when you're square you want to get
things that tuck into every corner
possible create the illusion of curves
weak heart necklines dresses that tuck
in your waist and a line of a great way
to break curb
addresses that have petticoat layers or
a great way to create more and more
volume and this so feminine ago
so you sexy ladies of the hourglass
shape you're lucky you can get away with
virtually anything so I say if you've
got it flaunt it if you are lucky enough
to have an hourglass bigger things that
our body can actually look gorgeous on
you be proud of yourself because many
girls would love to have this so-called
perfect figure if you're worried about
lumps and bumps or showing too much then
you can go for items that are ribbed or
are more of a bandage material these are
a great way to tuck yourself in so next
time i apple-shaped ladies and you have
something in common with me I'm
definitely more than apples with bit of
the tummy and I'm absolutely proud of it
where I do that I'm a bit more square
and that don't cling onto your stomach
and be proud of yourself so guys I hope
you enjoyed that video and I will so you
could be a combination of many of these
body types don't stress about it just
enjoy your body and be proud of here you
are thanks for watching guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
