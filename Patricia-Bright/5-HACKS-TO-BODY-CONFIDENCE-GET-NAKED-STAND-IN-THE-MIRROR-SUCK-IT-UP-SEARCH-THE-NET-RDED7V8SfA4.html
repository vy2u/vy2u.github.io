going to give you five tips to feeling
more confident in your body and I know
how hard it is for so many of us to feel
genuinely body confident especially in a
world where everybody looks absolutely
perfect
and you probably look in the mirror and
you think you look like a damn potato
and I have that feeling and I'm sure
some of you guys have that feeling and
it's kind of it's kind of hard you know
but there's things that you kind of want
to remember to kind of make you feel a
little bit better about yourself and
just be a bit more body confident and
I've especially felt like this being the
fact that you know I've got huge boobs
now and I've got like stretch marks and
things like that and sometimes I might
but sometimes I've got to be that you
know what it is what it is and this is
the way I am and I'm just gonna roll
with it but hopefully these five tips
are useful and I don't know help you
guys on those days where you're just
feeling like nah my body doesn't look
great so my first tip is to get naked
naked naked
that's my naked song I get to really
love getting naked and the kind of
person who walks around and I let it all
out windows open you know I don't even
care and I think there's nothing as
freeing as being naked and I know that
someone who's not feeling body confident
they probably don't want to see
themselves naked but I think there's
nothing wrong with having a cold hard
look at your naked body often in your
mind you think things look worse than
they actually are and when you stand in
front of the mirror naked and you count
those flab rolls and you look at that
hairy top lip or you see those things
you ever think you know what this is me
don't think I this is what it is but you
know what it's really important if you
want to feel body confident to actually
look at your body and see it for what it
actually is it's so my second tip is a
practical tip and it's actually just to
wear really good underwear I know that
if you're not feeling body confident the
last thing you want to do is dress your
regions in something fancy and more than
likely you're wearing your granny pants
and the discolored bra that sits in the
back of your closet
regular basis but that's not going to
make you thought any better about
yourself so for me it's all about
wearing some really good shapewear to
suck in the lumps and bumps it's kind of
like contour for the body which is
imperative right about now and when you
wear like a really nice bra that just
gives your boobs that h2 nicked and you
know shape if you want to wear a little
bit of padding you want to wear a bit of
lace just wear that right underwear will
make you feel a lot better and it will
also make your outerwear look nicer as
well and fit you more honestly sexy
underwear can always make you feel a
little bit more body confident my third
tip is to get inspiration from someone
who looks like you there is no point you
know if you don't like Jackie Chan
looking at Kim Kardashian for your
inspiration you're just different right
you're just different and you've got to
see that and I find that there's really
cool groups you know online of people
who love something about themselves that
you probably have that you probably hate
so there are plus-size models out there
you've got thousands of followers and
who really Rock and are confident in
their precise eNOS while you are hiding
in the corner you might as well have a
look at her see that she's confident in
what she had and the thing that you hate
about yourself she sees as beautiful the
same way there's someone who might be
really really pale in skin and think
that they look awful but then when you
look at my spell skin blog who's doing
amazingly they're not give you more
confident to see that you know having
really pale skin isn't the worst thing
in the world the same breath from having
really dark skin or really curly hair or
really short hair or really long hair or
there's so many different things that
you might look at yourself and think I
don't like that and there's going to be
someone out there who is celebrated or
celebrated in that one thing about them
why don't you go and do some research
and you know beautiful chubby girls or
beautiful ginger girls or beautiful dark
and mahogany girls and you will find a
ton of stuff that will give you the
inspiration you need to feel a bit more
confident in yourself so my fourth tip
is acceptance and this is basically if
it's something you can't do any
think about all you don't want to do
anything about it which might be you
know your situation you don't always
have to change something about your body
if you're not happy with it you can
definitely accept it there's nothing
worse than being that person here
complains and you know it doesn't like
something is it going to do anything
about it but hasn't accepted it I mean
you met a but as well accept it and then
definitely don't hide it if you really
know that you've accepted something then
you know that you're willing to share it
with the rest of the world confidently
and say well this is what it is
so my fifth tip is to basically do
something about it if you are someone
who cannot accept the thing you don't
like about yourself or like about your
body then it's time for you to start a
journey of improvement you need to
change that thing there's nothing worse
than being that person who complains
complains complains I hate this I hate
that but you're not doing anything about
it if you are overweight walking is free
you don't want to be that person who
sits there eating a burrito or having a
Dorito and no don't be that person if
you've got a unique brand that you hate
then do your research and get this a
hair removal you're someone who doesn't
like something about your body that's a
little bit difficult to deal with and
you may be one out of surgery go and do
your research and find out about it you
know don't be the person who sits there
crying and hates something about their
body and doesn't do anything about it I
ever accept it or work on it so guys
those are my five tips to help you feel
more confident in your body I definitely
feel like I've had to tell myself this
stuff of late because obviously as I
said lots of body changes lots of new
stretch marks lots of new rolls here and
there and I just kind of been rocking
and rolling with it but these tips are
ones I'm going to keep in my head and
just make me feel good when I need it
