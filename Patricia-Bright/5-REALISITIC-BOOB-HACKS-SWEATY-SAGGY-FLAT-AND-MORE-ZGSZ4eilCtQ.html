this is my nipples definitely want to be
free and say hello Tet everyone hey guys
welcome to my channel so today I'm about
to share with you five practical boob
hats that every single girl should know
and I watched lots of hat videos and
sometimes I what's that I think but
who's got time for this I want to know
what I can do real quick right now link
in the description box that I can change
the way I look or do something about
myself but today I'm going to show you
some of the tips and tricks that I think
are really good when it comes to the
booby region quickly addressing the
elephant in the room that my boobs are
enhanced if any girls are wondering how
they're so / however I'd like to say
boobs are boobs if you've got big boobs
small boobs fake boobs no boobs whatever
however one of these tips hopefully
applies to one of you guys so the first
hack is in relation to boobs sweat and I
know boob sweat sound a bit crusty and
not all that but you know what every
girl does suffer from them once in a
while especially as it's getting so hot
we've actually got real summer here in
London and some girls have rivers coming
from underneath them and some just get
that little bit of dampness that can be
a little bit uncomfortable so there are
two quick ways that I like to deal with
them are practical so number one is
using argan oil for some reason argan
oil is really good underneath the food
you can slap it on like a little oil and
it kind of acts like a seal that stops
it from sweating and I believe it also
has antibacterial properties which
stopped it getting so sweaty and grimy
alternatively you can try it a powder
and I know people used to use talcum
powder under their boobs but I find that
you end up with those like gross and
balls or just white powder and it's so
bad for your clothing but you can try
something like a really fine mildy o
drip powder this is the Greenwich do-do
pounder from lush which is very very
good it absorbs where is really fun and
it's a horrible deodorant so it's great
for your skin and won't leave an awful
mark on your clothing
so my next hat is for those of you who
want that instant boob lift and I've
seen the tip which is to use duct tape
and I thought to myself practically duct
tape hurts and used to pull that off
your skin
I've got time to put that underneath my
sensitive boobie region but instead
there's a product that is absolutely
amazing it is called lift it and these
are just basically chicken fill it with
just an extra bit of something-something
on the top and I'm telling you ladies
this thing I'm right here is like put it
on your breast like this but like it's
literally an instant boob lift it is
amazing and I think it's best probably
for holter net or something that is like
really deep v it will give you such high
boobs like you're like yeah I'll 16 the
game that's so so good so I love it so
my next hat is for those of you who want
to go back this but don't want to free
the nipple I'm definitely not a free the
nipple kind of God because my nipples
definitely want to be free and say hello
to everyone I absolutely love and bras
that are made specifically for this and
this is an example of a bra right here
that you can use backless and for low
front as well it's got a loaf curve at
the front as well as stickies on the
side so you get your boob support as
well as a little bit of downward
cleavage that is visible and your boobs
stay right in place I think if your
boobs are a bit bigger then this is
gonna work for you and definitely
thinking lift it is a much better option
but these are absolutely amazing if you
want to let your sexy back at the on
show so my next tag is the girls who
don't have very much going on in the
boobie region and you know they might
want to pick an outfit that just kind of
enhances what they do have or creates
the illusion and I always say go for a
sweetheart neckline as you can see I
wearing a sweetheart neckline right here
and because of the curve and the loaners
it just creates a little bit more drama
where there might be and it kind of
softens a very bony looking chest and I
will say if you can go for something
that's got boning and support in it like
this done this has got really good
boning in it
it's going to give you a little bit of
lift where there isn't much you know
going on you can also put a little
chicken fill it in there to give you
guys a little bit more rum other my last
hat is for those of you who have got the
bigger boobs because I know thoughts up
foods in the pot and not everyone has
small boobs and not everybody wants big
boom
and there's some gloves you want to
minimize their boobs while still looking
stylish there's a really good blog I
found which I will link in the
description bar below off the shoulder
tops are really great for disguising big
boobs but also draw attention to the
shoulder and the clavicle region which
are really elegant and to top it off if
you can go for something that is layered
as well and it will create less drama
and attention to the booby region as it
won't stick and will look gorgeous
so guys those are some of my boob hats
that I think every girl should know them
quick and easy and hopefully practical
I'll link everything I've shown in this
video down below and hopefully oh gosh
look it look what happened nananana
melon I know I kid y'all either see this
is PG I'm gonna call it out time
alright guys thanks for watching and I
will see you on Sunday bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
