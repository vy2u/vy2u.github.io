Oh certainly cough at my heritage so
today I'm going to do the 50 facts tag
and I really wanted to do this for ages
I don't know I haven't got around to
doing it to be totally honest with you
somehow been embarrassing somewhere it
you know whatever I'm very very
obsessive when I get something in my
mind like I lock into that and I can't
kind of get out of my head so I become
obsessive about a particular thing for a
seasoned I actually played the princess
in my school play which was called the
tinderbox and I had a solo and I'm just
going to sing it for you guys now
because my vocal capabilities are
amazing water soldier Tom dog it's a
tragedy
Oh beef only you could see it's a
tragedy thank you baby
my biggest fan I love singing and
dancing like I can't sing what I sing I
don't do a disappointment very well I'm
obsessed with food I literally plan my
days around my mills I love love love
studios your bull and then I don't I'm
probably not saying it right G he
belittled Jubilee but I absolutely loved
it
and Howl's Moving Castle is I think one
of my favorite films and slash cartoons
of all time my nickname was the
Incredible Hulk because I used to change
quite emotionally and go from very happy
to quite grumpy but luckily enough I
have worked on that I'm actually a
middle child I know I kind of portray
myself as the oldest child but I have an
older brother and sister who I didn't
grow up with but yeah I'm a middle child
I've been to Italy seven times and it's
one my favorite places to be in the
world
ciao got missed I did the banner that's
all I can
they say this is a weird one I'm really
scared of doing a Rollie pollie because
I think I'll break my neck
and I used to be able to do them but
I've not been able to do a Rollie pollie
in about ten years
I love Orford except for melon and raw
celery I talk a lot in my sleep I
actually wake people up because of how
loud I talk in my sleep and I might be
having conversation or an argument or
you know singing and dancing in my sleep
and I've had to be you know shaken awake
because I'm just going on with myself
and quite annoying to my husband I got
married to my college sweetheart she
call it that and one year and seven
months ago I do not have a driving
license I'm extremely extremely
impatient and again I'm working on that
I'm actually allergic to mosquito bite
so if I get bitten by a mosquito rather
than it just itching my skin swells up
starts to burn and goes really really
hard for about four days
my favorite place to be in the world is
actually in my home with my mom my dad
my sister and my husband I'm one of
those homebody ladies I cry probably
about twice a week I have two really
really good friends who I never get to
see enough of probably see them and
speak to him about once every three
months but we've been friends for so
long that they're my besties I am a
Christian and I absolutely love Christ
and I'm so glad that His grace has saved
me and I am the person who I am today
because of him I was a prefect at school
and some people say our prefix only and
Harry Potter no no I've never ever been
cool I thought I was cool I've never
been cool and now that I'm older I kind
of embraced the fact that I was just
never that guy I was like a floater and
I talked to everyone from the Goths to
the Sikhs to the rude girls to the
grungy to everyone and I actually just
kind of put around making friends in all
corners because you know I didn't really
fit in anywhere that I once befriended
at
when I was younger and this goat I
probably named him terribly and he was a
good friend and I used to go and see him
in the mornings and play around with him
though I was very very scared of him and
he then actually got served for as part
of Christmas dinner and I tried
intensely and I refused to eat tarry
because he was my friend I've been
chased by a turkey because I once picked
up like some baby chicks and this was in
Nigeria actually and I was just so
excited by the chips and then the turkey
saw me and my kept running and I ran
with the chick in my hand and then the
turkey was running after me and I was
really scared that I didn't want to do
and then I ended up flinging the chick
on the floor and then turkey stopped
chasing at me no chicks were harmed at
that point in time I love meat like I'm
a meat addict ever really really loud
love sometimes might laugh at yourselves
like I'm screaming yeah that's what
we're not sounds like people can get
scared sometimes I speak with my
eyebrows a lot of people say that my
eyebrows move a lot and now it's gonna
make it crazy but yeah I speak of my
eyebrows at times my favorite movie is
Romeo and Juliet featuring the another
DiCaprio and Leonardo was like my
heartthrob like even till now he's my
favorite actor one of my biggest dreams
is to create a drugs rehabilitation
center I don't have anyone who I really
know who's like into drugs but I think
that's one of the things that has always
bothered me and I really felt like the
needs to be places where people who have
drug addiction can go to and feel loved
and feel so safe and be helped and it's
like a big dream of mine in turn and
that one day I'll have a drugs
rehabilitation center it can be very
very messy but I'm very very clean at
the same time so I like make things a
bombsight
as my husband calls it but then I might
send four hours meticulously cleaning I
spend a lot of time shouting I shout a
lot not in my can
anyway but I just shout like you know
shout downstairs
I shout when I'm happy I shout at the TV
I shout at my sister I shot myself
growing up my parents always thought I
was going to be a lawyer and so did I I
think most Nigerian parents say you'll
be at Leah or you'll be a doctor it was
one of the other I always always fall
asleep in the car I don't know what it
is about the car it has me out like a
light
I can play the recorder but can't we all
because they all got taught that in
school right I have a sister could
Maureen who's absolutely amazing she's
annoyingly amazing I love documentation
excel and powerpoint on my best luck
friends I love I sit down doing Excel
spreadsheets for fun and creating
formulas for fun I actually don't like
someone I actually like autumn and like
December time because I like the gray
skies and like when it's cloudy it makes
you feel really cozy at home and I like
growing scarfs and layering and just
that feeling like I also love falling
asleep on the train again like I get
excited when I finish work because it's
like oh let's get a seat can't wait to
do that 20 minutes sleep I get properly
excited about a try and sleep it's one
of the best sleeps you can ever have
because you can wake up and it's like ah
I love hearing people's dreams and like
I used to love it on a Saturday morning
my sister's a massive dreamer as well I
have this dream and I'm like ooh get me
a cup of tea get me a cup of tea
and I've sit down and just hear her
dream there's something about listening
to what someone else has experienced in
like their subconscious I find so
exciting
and one of those people who shake their
feet and it's like really relaxing I am
usually hate sleeping on my own like at
uni I shared a bed with my friends for
for ages and I'm so grateful and like I
still always call into bed with my
sister Oh so this teeth that's a long
key right and I quite like my wonky
teeth people doing something because I'm
the one key teeth but actually
mice this will tooth was not always
wonky I am my sister head-butted me on
accident want and it dislodged my tooth
and that's fine I got that die guys I
hoped you enjoyed that video and it gave

me as a person and I'm not sure that was

different facts there okay and so thanks
