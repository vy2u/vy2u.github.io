this is not only gonna be nipple to the
wind it's gonna be internal organ to the
wind got some support but we've also got
some sex appeal I like that
hello beautiful people welcome to my
channel I hope you are doing well yes I
know my bun is looking particularly high
it is all the way out to Jesus right
about now curly hair is hot hot like
honestly I don't quite know what to do
with it it's a lot to deal with so we've
just scraped it up until almost like an
Amy Winehouse s bun and we're just gonna
cut half of it off on the camera so I
don't scare people but hey guys I hope
you are doing well today I've got a
little bit of a different video we're
gonna do a little bit of our underwear
war darlings we have coming up to
Valentine season and I'll be honest my
underwear drawer
looks very dusty like you can blow off
the dust but underwear drawers doesn't
get a lot of love and attention and I
feel like I don't really ever see people
like showing you what underwear they get
two beers and a bar on the way I haven't
bored when so long but you know seasons
have changed Valentine's are come in and
you know maybe might never have to just
deal with you know the same tighty
whities not so glam underwear for one
day it's nice to buy yourself new under
it the thing is I feel like new undoing
actually makes you feel like a new
person and I know I'm gonna say have an
outlet and the most body confident
person in the world I'm I'm fed more the
opposite of body confident however I
feel like when you get a new pant and
you bra you know a little thong a little
you know boy sure you know just
something like that it actually takes
your confidence levels from like here to
here so that's what we're gonna do today
right and hopefully I can give you guys
some inspiration and I had a voucher a
Victoria Secret for 500 pounds can you
imagine so I got some stuff from
Victoria Secret but I'm also gonna
compare it to the stuff that's a little
bit more affordable as well because the
doric secret is expensive it's really
expensive you know for bright and pants
Wow what'd you say a lot it's something
Wow anyway if you're not subscribed
subscribe I'm doing giveaways this month
of FEHB
so make sure you are interactive you can
comment on my Instagram and my snapchat
my Twitter all that good stuff but let's
just get into this video I've rolled up
my sleeves to show you undo that I'm
getting so excited
okay so first I'm gonna go ahead and
show you the goodies from Victoria's
Secret this is the first little lacy
number of your Gaga on my gosh look at
this this is a little lacy number 55
quid I think this was it's expensive for
a bra but I'm not gonna lie it is super
pretty I love the black and the like the
nudie color lace and now we're gonna get
into TMI territory
I have relatively large nipples that do
like to kind of stay kind of quite a lot
at the time and sometimes I avoided bras
like this because I could wear any bra
you could even have a light level of
padding but my nipple would still be
coming through can you just relax it
stuck and you just contract and just
stay back in don't embarrass me honestly
it's not even cold and you're standing
up relax so I always you I used to avoid
bras like this and I used to always go
for bras that would have like lots of
layers of lining just so that you know
no one would get a glimpse of my nipple
but I have become a little bit more like
you know what eff it my nipple is it
says high as Shia in the shot and then
tried a flu shot again I so love it I
love it when my a bra has got that like
lacy bit that just goes on this skin
like that and it looks really nice so
next up this is so cute I mean this is a
little bit mumsy but it's still cute
this is a 55 quid this is not padded if
you guys don't know and I feel like I've
shared this fair few times I have a
video on plastic surgery I had a boob
job probably about four years almost
five years ago now I know I know I had a
boob job girls
obviously sometimes they can look like
it wouldn't now it makes me as my boobs
sometimes they can look a little bit
like you know a little faith because I
literally don't have any breast issue so
I didn't have anything to cover and I
don't have any body fat like my arms are
super skinny I don't have any body fat
up here so it kind of look a little bit
more implant or fake but I'm happy with
what they look like and
I basically avoid entirely avoid padded
or bras that lift up my breasts because
I'm like they don't even need to be
lifted anymore they already have lots of
like silhouette to them without doing
this we just don't need to do that so
that's what I look for in a bra I like
the color it's kind of a lacy number as
well normally I go for a really plain
just smooth cup bras but you know you
got to live a little and like chill
look it's such a magical it'll fit right
now we're just going to be looking all
kinds of cute we've got some support but
we've also got some sex appeal and like
that matching panties now to be honest
my favorite panty shave my favorite
panty sheath is more of a boy short shot
but wear clothing isn't on they make
your bum so cute this isn't my favorite
shape but these just look so nice and
obviously they were matching and they're
actually quite thin I feel like they
won't give me a VPL when I wear it
these cost 16 pounds again like you know
you can get free for 10 pounds in in
Primark
No thank you okay I got bit fancy people
fancy for Valentine's Day what is this
this is so listen so basically I had a
gift voucher for Christmas I had a gift
voucher for 500 pounds which is a lot of
money to spend in Victoria's Secret and
I don't really go to Victoria to grab a
qualm i buy in anyway there was the new
bow main collection they have like a
collaboration I'm about main fan but I
can't necessarily purchase borrow main
items all the time but I can't Pete
purchase a piece of history and your
guards extra your gum is extra as she
found the most shining shining shining
yeah she actually just bought a shining
watch even call this like a bra I to me
thing I know I know it's called you guys
I know it's Gordie but it had to be it's
so cute it's a lovely little piece of
history and I had a gift voucher and I
didn't want to buy loads and loads and
loads of bras I was like let me just buy
something special I love the fact that
it's got like the branding on it and
Monte's everywhere listen imagine if you
like you know it's valentine's the man
takes up your top for that he just sees
you with your crystal bedazzled piece of
underwear he's gonna think you're a
bougie or crazy this is expensive
because it is the Balmain collaboration
I think this was 220 pounds I'm not
suggesting you guys go out there and buy
that maybe a cute guy who's watching
might want to get this for one of his
girlfriends one of his girlfriends his
only girlfriend his only girlfriend
don't be to time in so this does make
them look a bit boob light but what I
thought is that actually be really nice
it's very Madonna under like a black
blazer or like something a little bit
smart I like I'm not just gonna be
walking out on the street with my
bedazzled top but like under a jacket or
something oh Lord we're stuck we're
stuck we've got boobage under a jacket
that would look really really good to be
honest I'm not a victoria secret shopper
I do find it to be quite expensive but I
do know that people like to go there for
like special occasions or if it's their
birthday or if they want to get someone
a present and they want to get them
something really nice yeah you can find
things like this at Victoria's Secret
which I'm doubtful but not everybody has
that pocket so let's just move on
so I also went on to a zorse comm just
to get myself you know some cute little
pieces and I went slightly overboard I'm
not gonna die and I picked up this to be
honest I'm looking at this and I'm like
can you even fit my fist into that what
the hell this is like the size of a
newborn's head what is the point in this
this is just about gonna cover my nipple
but how cute is the color I love little
lacy Brown lips like this which again I
was always very very scared to even try
these because I always wanted too much
coverage but now I'm just saying I want
to wear what I you in and it might
be you might see my nipple and they
might say hi but whatever um I just want
this it's okay the thing is though when
you've wear stuff like this you're kind
of wearing it for yourself you're not
really wearing for anyone I'm not the
kind of person who's out there no
nipples to the wind all the time
sometimes we saw
a little to win but most of the time I'm
not so when I get my underwear like this
this is really for me and I was like I
look good in yellow yeah cute oh yes
and then this is my favorite this is my
favorite style of pants these look quite
big though why they look so big what
size are these these are the size 8 okay
so like French Nicholas are my favorite
I feel like just that little bit of
booty cheek coming out the bottom it
just makes your bum look cute even if
you don't have any bum like this will
create an illusion of having something
because half of something is going to
come back unless you have an extreme
extender back which this is not going to
be flattering for you but I've got a
little bit of lower booty I've got a
little bit of low ability just coming
underneath there
this shows that off nicely so then I
found this little sexy number succeed
can you told me this is not cute look at
this look at the pose just going down
the middle
it's a longline bra I love longline bra
because they they're not like a bra
they're like a longline bra so so cute
with the pearl details and the
contrasting color
it's fantabulous darling I feel like
this is a bra that you can wear it like
to be glam and to be sexy but also you
can just wear to life you know
underneath the shirt and then you're
like I feel so good under the oh my gosh
what is this I feel like this is one
kind of 50 shades 50 shades of grey vibe
like just wearing sexy underwear
underneath your clothing just so that
you feel good I remember that listen
feel good in your underwear no this is
gorgeous and then
look at my face guys look at Patricia's
face I need to make this video it's not
really x-rated it so many underwear it's
just material just material okay but
this isn't got come on now can you not
told me this is cute but look at this I
spend about how cute and sexy is that no
lies at all you just want to wear the
matching set just because and now to be
completely honest with you I do not
understand what suspender belts are
actually for they work for like tights
that you know the tights that grandma's
wear but then sometimes it kind of
starts hanging down and then gathering
at the ankle and it just looks wrinkly
and off-key that so that's not sexy plus
we all wear normal tights if anyone
actually wears tights anymore but it was
so cute and it looks so nice on the
website with the bra I move like the
suspenders and the knickers I was just
like oh wait let me just add this to my
car
this is just adding to the car for the
sake of adding to the car but it's cute
come on this is so cute with the bra as
well let's look with the bra and the
suspenders oh okay this was gorgeous
right I got a little bit carried away I
didn't even get basics I've got basics
I've got my black my white my beige like
I've got the basics so we just wanted to
add some pizzazz and vibrance right and
this is so nice I saw this on the
website again this looks like it's
literally just gonna cover a nipple what
in the hell no be getting some coverage
I don't think you can tell how cute this
actually is what I love is that it's got
this extra piece of fabric right there
which i think is really nice not only
does it have that detail there but it's
got this lace detail right here and this
is made of velvet a little bit Queen how
nice is that this is basically a bra
that's got a little bit of everything
going on I am not mad at that bright I
think it's super super cute I think it
would really look nicer some denim as
well and then it comes with the matching
panties as well now I feel like this
things that you know when I say what
you're gonna say now I don't understand
what this little hole is here for this
depends on where this sits because this
might be sitting oh this little hole
maybe right where your tuft might be
growing out I mean if you got a little
bit of Brazilian going on I'm like why
would I want my what you don't want is a
pair of knickers which literally sits
right where the tuft is going to come
out not that I'm extremely tough d or
anything it weighs like really you want
that sub-project
out of there either way besides this bit
the matching velvet underwear I've
always really cute it's got the lace
cute bits at the back as well ah so
gorgeous okay so also talking about the
underwear as outerwear it's the full
lace line bodies this one was from Paul
mwah which is also on a sauce and these
are really good to wear like out and
about like with a white with a pair of
wide leg trousers and a blazar on top
yes and the cup size looks so reasonable
but I love these kind of one pieces I've
been really wanting one of these just so
I can wear them with jeans or the blaze
on top it's like how you can bring your
like sexy from the inside out I think
that is so cute very nice this was the
best one I found a lot of them just seem
to - underwear II it was literally
sitting like this and that is just doing
the most so this one was ill though it
is underwear I think it could pass well
cute little top and I never understand
when they have like those body suits and
their lace and they're all see-through
so we're actually doing actual nipple to
that we're not fake nipple to the wind
actual just breast out on show maybe
that's the fashion I don't really know
this is okay this was at my favorite pit
Oh what the hell is this okay so this
was this is a lot more open than I
thought I don't even know what this is
this looks like a doily this is actually
a doily they just made the doily and
sold it as underwear but what the hell
is this
it doesn't look like what it looks like
in the picture there's not enough fabric
here this is not only going to be nipple
to the wind it's going to be
internal-organ
to the wind what what in the hell up oh
I get it there
we go this is so confusing do you know
what I don't like clothing I don't
understand now I'm here we get it but
there isn't much material here mate I
wonder what this looks like on just like
this listen we're not gonna get we're
not going to get any coverage here and
it's it's it's very very see-through so
that's a bit the fail sorry guys
so this is what I'm talking about this
here is a proper really nice bralette
it's like a little lace number it is a
bit may see in a little bit seafood but
you can nipple Pat it I love the shape
of it it's just so cute it kind of
crosses over slightly croc it's got this
little bit of like ribbon detail right
there that kind of cinches you in and
then it comes with Jesus that is for
someone with the longest back on earth
what that what in the hell is that a
high-waisted thong that is a
high-waisted thong I wonder what that
looks like on I need to get back to you
guys
this is that if someone would have a
really long back for that to look good
what the hell they never showed the back
of this on this website and I can't
understand why it's nice though because
it comes above the belly button and I
love the ribbon detail as well we're
just gonna have to work our way around
the thumb situation sorry guys I got
carried away guys this number here this
gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous bra look at
that detail right there that was so cute
I was like this is right up my street
this is so nice it's actually quite
similar to this but this isn't actually
that see-through and this is velvet
right there I just wanted to add some
glamour to my underwear wardrobe because
it was looking like an old age
pensioners home it was just looking
great dude how nice is that though
nipples to the wind it's all good though
we are good oh these panties I thought
that these would look really good with
the power bra these are from new look I
actually bought some other bits from new
look their underwear section is actually
epic and actually be really affordable
these are a size a and
see see fruit AF and I feel like they
are so cute and they look really nice
and they'll go perfectly as a contrast
with the light pearl set and finally oh
I like this the yeah yeah oh I feel like
I've just seen this like properly on
camera it looks so nice
this is another new look goody it's a
long line bra with a little bit of satin
and it's got a little mesh here this one
is gonna give me one push up breast look
it's just gonna do one cup each but it's
so nice of what was pretty I think it
would look really nice with this little
seafood pair these would match and look
really good together I think like okay
guys I think that is it from me that is
the first time I've done an underwear
haul ever and then if you like that kind
of thing but I wanted just to share a
couple of bits and bobs that I picked up
again Valentine's it's come in my
underwear wardrobe was looking looking
dry it really did look dry it really
needed to be resurrected from the dead
and I feel like I was able to get some
nice bits that I'm happy with and maybe
other people in my life might be happy
with but yeah little inspo I have links
