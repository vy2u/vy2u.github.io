I've got the 50 P add a phrase yes
ladies I've done a look that is
considered affordable hopefully and I
know some of your thinking girl how did
you do 50 P well basically I bought a
whole bunch of items and it came to
about 90 something pounds and I was like
that's expensive like 90 pounds or some
change is expensive which probably is
about 100 and 110 dollars and but I've
realized that when you buy it all new
makeup is because it's gonna launch you
from anywhere between three to six
months of you're looking at the six
month spectrum that means it's 15 pounds
a month which is basically around 50 P a
day darlings get your calculators out
and I'm sorry I'm just on ten right now
I'm just gonna simmer down slightly
because I really like the look that I've
done and I was quite happy that it was
all affordable so yeah it's really easy
to do I have everything linked in the
description bar below and you might have
noticed that I've got a new background
and it's only for when I do makeup
tutorials just cuz I feel like it's
easier to really focus on the makeup on
the background and I love watching girls
who use their backgrounds and stuff so I
was like I want one of those as well and
it means that you can't see them if
that's going on in my bedroom right
about now cuz it's not amazing and also
here is where I get so many questions
about one you have thank you all for the
love it is why hair but I am wearing a
frontal it was customized by me by
Marvin I'll put his details in the
description bar below he's amazing and
then I just got packs of 16 in the end
and I just use a the nume curling wand
to create these curls so all my snapchat
fans are asking me there you go guys and
in the meantime I really hope you
enjoyed this video and yeah hopefully
you find it affordable if there are any
other Beauty tutorials you want to see
for me please do let me know
and you'll see them more soon so guys
thank you for watching and I'll see you
later bye so the first thing I'm using
is the NYX pore filler I cannot believe
how massive NYX now is like when I used
to buy it I used to go to like my small
little corner store and get it but I
know it's myself and I always buy makeup
online but just seeing the display
amazing next and going in with a Max
Factor Kohl pencil and I did actually
buy the NYX and brow eyebrow pencil but
I don't like it very much I found it to
pull out my eyebrows which just did
they're just not fire right now they're
just not fire but and I prefer this
Clips much creamier and is a eye pencil
but I use eye pencils on my Brown we're
fine with that I'm going to go in with
this product which is affordable it is
the Barry M it's a brown thing it's a
brow powder and this has been in my
collection for quite a while and I
really do like it and it's got this like
soft fluffy tip and I don't know why
it's making always it's a bit random
it's a really nice dark brown brow
powder try saying that in like one way
it's so crazy and and look I don't if
you can see it just adds a little bit of
darkness so I am going to go in with the
LA girl Pro concealer and this cost 399
that's nice and affordable and the color
I'm using is fawn and a lot of people
use this as they go to concealers
because it is really good thick coverage
however I do find that it's a little bit
too thick for me but for the purpose of
this video I'm going to use it now when
you get a song stuck in your head and
you're literally just singing it the
whole time and it's actually annoying
you as you sing it and that's me today
and I'm just going to put a bit of
concealer on my lids to their little
dark I'm not going to lie that concealer
isn't really my favorite because it
dries really quickly so I find it quite
hard to blend but I am currently going
in with the L'Oreal True Match this
foundation is really good and L'Oreal do
have an amazing range for all colors but
the thing is is that they offer
and or they used to not have all the
colors in store however this is changing
a lot at the moment and I must say for a
drugstore foundation this has got a
mazing coverage anything looks like I've
got a little bit too much on I should
have got gone on a little bit lighter
right okay love that so I'm going to go
in it with the sleek cream contour kit
to highlight under my eyes I was going
to use the la girl but actually because
I don't really like that concealer very
much I'm actually going to use something
that I can say I respect and have a look
at this it looks really nice and the
colors are really gorgeous on this and
this brush is from bare minerals and I'm
not going to lie I love this brush to
apply my concealer I like to apply it
closer to my nose because it has a nice
narrowing effect
I tell me what you guys think of my
background I'm still trying to work out
how to get my lighting to look and stuff
like that but I feel like for beauty
tutorials I really do like how
backgrounds look because they're so nice
and easy that concealer there is lovely
creamy didn't over dry the color is
gorgeous and not ashy I'm happy baby I'm
happy much you're going to use that
cream contour as well then as you can
see that color is not really dark enough
for contour definitely go darker so I'm
not gonna lie I'm looking real shiny
almost almost wet at this point in time
so I'm going to just go in and add a
little powder I'm going to use the NYX
mineral set it don't fret it paradis
here the color I've got is meet light to
medium I probably should have gone for
something a little bit darker but we'll
see and I know for a fact I really like
this set in powder it's funny as I use
it I can feel it just sucking up all the
oil
these are turquoise brushes are also
from ambi rose and I really do like them
well that sucked up all the oil nicely
real nice right I'm looking like honey
little bit of contour and powder and
some stuff but I'm going to do my eyes
first and I'm going to use the NYX
ultimate shadow palette and this color
is the warm Mutual's
what does that remind you of but I must
say the colors on this are die like
they're so gorgeous I'm just going in
with this kind of purply color and using
that just to cover almost my whole lid
and I'm going to go in it with this dark
brown here which is a bit on the cooler
side just to give myself a light crease
and this is look is a little bit you
know dramatic for everyday but I feel
like this palette you could totally use
anytime you need and then I'm going to
go in of a little bit of sparkle and I'm
the middle for this kind of pinky purple
Sparkle and just tap that on my lid I'm
going to use the gold just in Metiria
don't line and it's really pigmented
liquid liner and going in with the
Maybelline master ink and this is a
really good liquid liner and it lasts
for ages I thought this was so long I
should probably throw it away but it's
so good I've got to use it to this empty
I'm gonna go in with a Rimmel
scandaleyes as a black liner and I hate
line in my eyes everybody knows that and
going in with the false lash Scott
mascara from L'Oreal Paris y'all know
y'all know I think I've talked about
this a lot of times how much I love this
mascara I love the wand I love
everything about it and I don't often
get to the ends of mascara because I
always get new ones this one is on this
last legs which means I love it so next
I'm going in with the sleek face contour
kit and I've just realized that the
color I've got is the medium sad time so
I don't know if this is going to be dark
enough for me let's just see I'd like to
go in for the dark dog but let's just
take this one for the team Trisha
alright and then I'm going to go in with
the brush by three palette from sleek as
well and it's got this color here called
dermal era this is a really nice blush
and then
go in with this color as the highlighter
here and actually in the contour pink
it's got a really good highlighter this
one's a bit Golder though
so quite like this feel like I look
really young for some reason and not in
a good way I need to put some lashes on
and my lashes are the velour lashes so
sadly I will not call them drugstore or
affordable but I'll call them amazing
obviously a good alternative are our
doll lashes but people don't usually
wear lashes on an everyday basis and for
me like the are dolls are nice but I
didn't buy any new ones because this is
quite expensive now in the stores like
$6.99 I'm like no no thank you
because the villas I can wear for like
10 times and I really feel like I get my
wear out of them whereas I don't feel
like that's the same with my are Dells
ever link in the description bar below
as well because I can get a good
discount
finally I'm going to finish up with my
lips and I'm going to go for something
nice and glossy I'm using a brown pencil
from Kiko the color is free 1/4 and it's
a really good jute to chestnut from Matt
and then I'm going in with the ultra
glossy lip from colour-pop and this
color is called with you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
