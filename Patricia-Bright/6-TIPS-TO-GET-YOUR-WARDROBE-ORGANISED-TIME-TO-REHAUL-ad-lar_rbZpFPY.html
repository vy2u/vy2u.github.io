have had a little bit of a mommy
makeover I'm looking a little bit
different which I'm sure you guys have
noticed if you're not following me on my
social on my snapchat and on my
Instagram then you probably won't know
but I have had my little baby I gave
birth on a Monday and it's currently
Wednesday and I know it sounds a bit
crazy but you guys know what I'm like I
love filming to basically cleave in acts
and everything and I want to do an intro
to the world for her which I'm going to
shoot as well but I thought I might as
well do a Thursday video and do the
intro to her on Sunday but yes I gave
birth it was amazing it was a whirlwind
I'm gonna tell you all about it so stay
tuned for Sunday but I just wanted to
say thank you to everyone for all your
love your support your tweets your
messages your emails everything I've had
so much love and people just reaching
out to me and yay I have finally had the
little one which is feels like I'm
feeling so much more relieved and like I
feel fresh but just having her here is
just such a beautiful thing she's laying
comfortably asleep on the bed but we
don't know for how long someone just get
shooting but today I really wanted to do
this video that I've been wanting to do
for ages and I wanted to give you my
tips and tricks for organizing your
wardrobe and the reason I'm doing this
is because when I started this channel I
basically started it by doing hauls and
outfits of the days and lookbook so I
was like the key thing I did and I still
like a wall and I still like a lookbook
but probably in a lot more moderation
and I used to do it and I've also been
inspired because the next week is
actually World recycle week and haitch
them have this really cool concept
called the rehaul where basically you
can take your items into store that you
don't want anymore and 99% of those
items will be reused or resold and just
will be repurposed in a way that is
really useful so I was like you know
what let me do this video to help some
of you guys make
that decision and as I mentioned I've
kind of been going on a minimalism
journey ever since kind of doing this
law then having a baby coming and really
wanting to sort my house out and I feel
so much better it's ridiculous what it's
like to have a clean closet and my
closet is literally now half the size
and super organized so my first tip when
it comes to organizing your wardrobe is
to create categories now y'all know me
you guys know that I am a very big nerd
I love Excel and don't think I didn't
have in Excel slash a three-page
document when it came to organizing and
clearing up my closet and I think it's
so important to create categories if you
fail to plan you plan to fail so what I
basically did was I created categories
of the types of clothing I wanted to
have in my closet so I have tops bottoms
outerwear and dresses and within say
tops I have 4 to 5 different types of
top so knitwear button-down t-shirt vest
and something else so you definitely
have to create the categories that work
for you but it's definitely worth just
sitting down and working out what you
want to be in those categories and then
when I've got those categories I
basically organized by color style trend
and all the different things that are
important to me so my second tip when it
comes to clearing out your closet is to
take everything out don't just kind of
you know look through and think I don't
like this I don't like that empty your
closet lets you take everything out and
have like a white box to start off with
and then put items in the great thing
about doing that is that when you're
doing that you're deliberate with your
decision making and you will really look
at the piece and say you know yes this
piece definitely has to go in but
sometimes you might see it and be like
overwhelmed so having a clear slate to
start with will definitely help you have
a much better cause it my third tip is
to be ruthless this is not the time to
fun and are in my opinion anything that
you don't feel that good in you know
you've got that item like when you wear
it you're like I don't even feel like I
look that good in this item or you bring
it out you say yeah I'll wear it and
then last minute you're like 9
going to wear it that item it needs to
go you know you might have four white
tees no one needs for white tees so be
ruthless and decide on your two best
fitting and best quality white teeth
like that you just got to color things
and just work out what really suits you
and if it isn't working for you it needs
to go my fourth tip is to have that plan
for the items that you are taking out of
your closet because the reality is
sometimes you might just leave it in a
big pile on the side and then it kind of
sits there and somehow it makes its way
back into your closet or you end up
throwing it in a bin and I think that's
so so bad lots of clothing goes to
landfill and that's why I really love
the concept of log recycle week if
you've got a bunch of stuff that you
know you're not going to want you'll
know you know you're not going to sell
why not going into a local H&amp;amp;M store
where you can bring bags of items in and
these items will be resold reused
repurposed ninety-nine percent of them
and I think there's nothing wrong with
that
because if you're not going to use it
you never know someone else in this
world might use it that t-shirt might
become a blanket it might become
something else and I think that is
totally valuable some people also choose
to sell items or take items to their
local charity shop my fifth tip is for
those items that you really love
but our seasonal pieces is to basically
box them off you don't need a fur jacket
in summer and you don't need a bikini in
the winter but there might be a really
nice fur jacket that you love that you
bring out every year it really doesn't
need to sit in your closet all year
round so I have plastic boxes that I buy
from like the DIY shop and I've got a
box of all the stuff that's like my
summer wear and my hardcore winter wear
that I don't need full right now and I
basically bring those out and check them
each season so my sixth tip is to really
think about guilt free shopping and I
love the concept of one in one out
there's nothing wrong with buying new
pieces but there needs to be a reason as
to why you're buying it either you
realize that the gap in what you need I
live from a color or a style or a trend
action or it's a case of you just feel
that you might need to upgrade a really
old or tatty item and make sure the
pieces that you do by suit you don't
just buy something because it's trendy
because it will sit in your closet so
guys those are my tips and tricks when
it comes to organizing your wardrobe
these are some of the basics that I
really did to basically come my wardrobe
in half there guys I hope you enjoyed
that video and I will catch you guys on
a Sunday and we will have an intro to
the baby and everything but in the
meantime I'll see you later bye guys
