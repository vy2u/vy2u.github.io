and then one of these really hyper moods
which is popular me 99.99% of the time
new haircut new me I want people to be
prepared because this year my hair is
going to change kind of like every other
hour because I can do that and I love it
and I feel a bit more sophisticated and
swore with a little body like this but
yeah so today I wanted to do a skincare
video because I love love love skincare
and I wanted to try some like that hacks
that I have seen and kind of just give
you my thoughts on them and whether or
not they work and a lot of the hats I
find them more like kitchen hats because
there's a lot of do-it-yourself DIY and
be at home and I'm going to be a hundred
percent honest as you guys I like to buy
everything I don't like to do it sounds
bad and I and I feel like this is the
year of honesty I like to buy stuff and
if you guys have noemi's watched me for
long enough you will know that like if I
see like an ad like an info commercial I
buy that I have an infomercial Queen 21
day fix I got it Proactiv I got it I had
all of it so I prefer to use products
versus you know trying to mix
concoctions up myself however I did that
in this video today to kind of show that
you can do certain things at home
yourself and I tried out some of the
really popular hacks fire out there also
put a little bit my own twist on it as
well for some of these you might not
know about so hopefully this video is
useful especially if you are the kind of
person who does have large pores for
those of you who do with discoloration
and for those of you who are coming to
my age me and like you know what I want
my skin to be all the way tight so
number one we're going to get up close
and personal and I'm going to show you
what my growth as pores look like and it
is using a dental heart to basically
extract pause the
actually work it works so well and I'm
the kind of person that normally like it
sounds gross I'm in the mirror I like
going I squeezing and extracting
whiteheads but using the dental floss
work and I think it works because
basically it has a really small surface
area basically the piece of string and
you are able to kind of rub that against
your skin and it will kind of push the
content of your filled up pull and push
it out using a really good amount of
pressure I use the dental heart because
I've seen a lot of people doing that
however I do think actually just using a
piece of string or just a normal longer
piece of floss it's probably slightly
more easier to maneuver because you get
a little bit more Oh
however it works and another thing that
is really good for my large pore having
and ladies is activated charcoal and
combining that with yogurt activated
charcoal is literally so popular
everybody's using it for everything and
it's been used in the medical industry
for people who've had overdoses for
quite a long time because it absorbs
impurities and it absorbs drugs and it
absorbs like oil and grease and stuff
like that so combining that with the
power of yogurt - which is something
that I came up with doing I don't know
if I've seen it before maybe someone's
done it before but yogurt is really good
on the face because it's really gentle
and soothing especially if it's been in
the fridge and it also contains a high
amount of lactic acid which a lots of
dermatologists use in high
concentrations to create pills to help
resurface and regenerate skin so my
mindset combined from activated charcoal
combines a bit of yogurt and what you
had is an ultimate pore busting face
mask what I love about this face mask is
that it is really cooling it is really
gentle and it feels really good
alternative if you want to get the power
of activated charcoal then our charcoal
face masks like the one I had here
however I'm not even going to light and
not a friend of these Pete peel-off mask
when I did this it really really hurt
but thumbs up to the yoghurt and
activated charcoal mask
so after in for a safe treatment if you
guys didn't know aspirin contains a high
amount of salicylic acid and it can be
used as a quick spot treatment for those
of you who suffer from acne or breakout
or like just a random spot that wants to
end up in the middle of your forehead
aspirin is known to be actually super
useful but yeah what I did is just
crushed it up mix it with some water and
popped it on my areas of break-up and
afterwards
it shrunk that nicely science behind it
is the fact that salicylic acid is one
of those assets that is able to
penetrate under the skin and it's able
to go into the pore and kind of change
the shape of the pore and make it nice
and small this one it can make me look
all kind of stupid but in the long time
is going to keep your skin tight and
lovely and amazing I feel like nowadays
I feel like what might his face to look
a little bit tighter if you don't use it
you lose it
so facial exercises are something that
everybody should really be doing and
especially if you are over the age of 25
because some people skin kind of starts
to go south and as they do say black
don't crack however it can get a little
bit jowling so I'm managing that and
facial exercises are actually really
good and the way it worked is like
basically engaging the muscles
underneath your face to be stronger and
firmer the same way you can have a
floppy and you know loose kind of body
because you don't exercise the same
thing applies to your face lucky for me
I'm a really expressive person so I feel
like my face has a permanent work out
like all the time I was just spending
ten minutes in the morning is a really
great pad to actually keep your face
looking tight and right yes another hat
that I saw was the ice bag treatment and
supposedly women in Hollywood did this
for a really long time to kind of make
their skin look tight and glowy and
Julie and I totally get it when your
face is cold what happens is that your
continuity's constrict your pores kind
of tighten and it's really nice you kind
of get this kind of flushed tight glow
and the whole concept is that if you use
it around your jawline and
it's going to help to tighten the skin
now for me I can see it definitely
working for a kind of quick fix so doing
the cold environment it constricts but I
think eventually in the long term it's
going to relax however there's some
people who actually like ice roll every
single day every single morning and they
say that that is the reason what they
have a non sagging looking face however
there are some slight side effects
especially if you have quite thin or
quite delicate seeing skin you can end
up with broken capillaries sort of me
this hat comes with a warning and you
say potato and then I saved turtle
potato potato potato potato
so potatoes on the face potato on the
face or thread thoughts from that I mean
I prefer to eat potatoes that is putting
them on my face because potatoes are
life however I complete you a hundred
percent get this now I think people have
moved away of this concept of like
rubbing lemon on your face because lemon
itself because of the high acidic
content is really quite harsh but the
benefits of vitamin C are obviously
amazing in something like a sweet potato
you can get the exact same benefit of
high levels of vitamin C without the
crazy level of acidity that you can get
in a lemon and for people who have got
like really dark bags or dark marks just
rubbing a bit of potato don't lick it
because what potato isn't this for you
and but yeah you can rub some potatoes
in those areas and it will actually help
your skin one because potato juice is
also quite nourishing it could be really
good antioxidants and it's just some
added moisture and again that vitamin C
nature's answer to darks marks and
breaking down pigments that you don't
necessarily want finally stealing who
doesn't still I mean I was going to say
who does esteem but I don't seem
regularly and now I need to Rachel semen
is really good it as moisture bracket
and support it's great for extraction
however what is better than steaming or
the extra juicy hat is steaming with
rose water rose water is one of those
things that you can actually get the
farmers
because it's so beneficial for so many
things it contains lots of antioxidants
it's really gentle and nourishing on the
skin especially if it's combined with
glycerin if you want to steam your face
which you can use actual a professional
steamer or you can use a hot bowl of
water steaming with the beloved rose
water is even better and it smells
delicious as well so those are some of
my thoughts on those skincare hacks are
out there that I didn't even know about
some of these so hopefully you find them
useful you might do them I might do them
a bit more regularly I know if that and
somebody likes to buy buy everything but
you know what once in a while there's
some things that you might be able to
find in your kitchen that are just as
useful so guys thank you for watching if
you're not already subscribed please

notifications give this video a thumbs
