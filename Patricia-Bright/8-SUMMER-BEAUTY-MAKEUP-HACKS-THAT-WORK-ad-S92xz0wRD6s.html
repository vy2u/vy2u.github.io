to my channel the sun is shining the
weather is sweet and I feel like
something is now here I am very very
happy about that
and you guys know I've been traveling a
lot this year I've been to Mauritius
I've been thermal Isaiah your iPad
mystic key you know going away enjoying
the photos and however the one that I
absolutely hate when I'm traveling or
just this time of year it's how hot it
gets and how my makeup looks like a
melted pan like it's actually a joke
normally I leave my house I feel fresh a
format I feel gorgeous
and then in ten minutes I look at my
reflection I'm like what on earth a
pattern so today I wanna share some of
my summer spring makeup tips and hacks
that are really good and they actually
make a huge difference which will be
great if you're traveling if you're at
home and you don't like a hot mess
quickly I want a shout out that close my
sponsors for this video as part of the
diapers break series and yes let's get
into this video okay so number one isn't
really a hack it just means that you
need to be on I but basically it is to
look for waterproof foundation you may
not realize that there are a ton of
waterproof foundations out there buy
lots of different brands and you can
wear that it will swim inside your
holiday feature somewhere you can dip in
the water and come out looking after
these flawless and most of the time you
may find that your favorite brand has a
waterproof foundation you just need to
ask that the character for those
waterproof option and I think it's great
as long as it if your heart if you're
sweating if it's waterproof is
definitely going to be sweat proof as
well okay so the next part is milk of
magnesia now this is old school people
have talked about this video I feel like
people slept with it they've forgotten
about it honestly it gives you the most
sweat proof makeup I've ever seen and
gives you a flawless finish I do not
know how it works but it actually worked
milk of magnesia is basically an acidity
to like indigestion and that kind of
things you can find at pharmacy to
provide at lots of different stores food
stores wherever it's almost a common
bathroom product and it works really
well to basically provide you with it
Night Lights
Pryor's base but also it's got your
makeup from melting and your
we're coming through I don't know why it
works but it was extremely well but also
it's more thunder for everyday use
definitely you did spare me only for
that time where you need that
bulletproof makeup would you ever need
to lose milk of magnesia but it
definitely were and could be good to
have reviews if you're traveling away so
the next step is in regards to sweaty
eyelid this is something that I face all
the time
anytime I go away even when I'm here my
eyelids I just get that sweat line right
across there and it isn't a good look
the one thing I've started to do is
actually baking my eyes so they all know
how to bake under eyes but what about
baking your eyelids it makes very much
difference nowadays I fish use like a
Paint Pot or some kind of primer and I
go ahead and use my powder on my eyelid
and then I go in with my normal eyes
shadow and honestly it doesn't impact
the way the eyeshadow looks and it
really stops the creasing and of those
oily eyelids from just peeking out so
the next tip is super easy anyone can do
it you project these products at home if
you are using a brush or a Beauty
Blender Bottle will sponge whatever you
use just spray it with your setting
spray beforehand and then apply your
foundation it definitely makes it a
little bit more longer-lasting and I
feel like it really does minimize how
much your sweat peeks through this is
all the range semi-permanent makeup
you guys have missing people getting
micro bleeding and you know eyelash
extensions and all this stuff and I
think that they are really good I cannot
get in my eyebrows microbe ladies
however in reality not all of us are
gonna you know invest in micro bleeding
but let's not forget that there are
other semi-permanent makeup options out
there so things like having your
eyebrows tinted your eyelash tinting
these are really good ways of having
makeup that suits for at least three to
four weeks and it really gives you a
more natural and permanent makeup look
just having eyebrows looking a little
bit more darker a little bit more
refined really makes a difference it's
the same for tinting your eyelashes or
even get like an eyelash perm these are
simple ways that I just a bit more depth
and dimension to your face without
having separate the bad and you
basically have spend time in makeup for
like the next three to four weeks and
it's a really good option if you're
someone who wants to be bare face on the
beach but you still want to look
okay so the maximum is very simple and
luckily very trending and it's basically
to rock the sneak bond when I was in
Mauritius I basically wore my hair in
the feedback ponytail I feel like after
wearing actually every holiday I've been
on I have been wearing a ponytail
because when it's so hot and you just
Tiger there's just no time for all of
this on a PC to help out do a side swim
to a middle part a little bit of texture
it looks amazing
okay so my next tip is basically carry
some baby powder with you everywhere
honestly it's really really useful if
you have chub rub if you have sweaty
armpit if you've got a sweaty face just
tell you a little bit of baby powder of
powder on your face put on your arm
powder on your side honestly it is a
secret that really really work and
there's different types of baby powder
so make sure you find one that works for
you so finally if you do end up looking
kind of a bit shiny a bit greasy just
work with it you know what you need to
do as a little bit of silver on top even
if you get oily here and a little silver
eyeshadow so the highlights are just
makes it look like it's a natural glow
from the inside out honey it's not sweat
is blown on the eyes a wash of sylvari
that kind of Sun kids natural beauty
look don't hide it work with it okay
guys so those are my hat so when it
