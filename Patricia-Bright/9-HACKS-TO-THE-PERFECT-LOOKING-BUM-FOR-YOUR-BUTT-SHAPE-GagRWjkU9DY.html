what about a bullying bullying racket
really well hey hey today I wanted to do
a bit of a tips a bit of a hackers video
on making your bubble up the best
particularly based on your bum shape and
bum type and for you guys who don't know
but there's so many different bat shapes
and not everything it's gonna work for
you if your bum shape is not you know
it's not suited to that so if you've got
a V shape or an indented bum as I call
it then high-waisted jeans are not going
to be your best friend like it's not
gonna look good on you I also have like
a square shaped bum now that I kind of
analyze so certain things are going to
enhance my shape and certain things are
just not gonna look good as well so I
think it's really good if you can work
out what your butt shape is please do
let me know what your project is and
then dress accordingly to enhance and to
hide and to show off bits and bobs that
they don't want to see so today I'm
going to share some my favorite tips and
hacks for different bummer shapes before
I get started if you're not already
subscribed to my channel please do
subscribe all you have to do is press
that little red button it's really easy
to do it's free doesn't cost you
anything I'm hoping that this video
really gives you guys a little bit of an
inspiration even if you've got a V a
little bit of an indented bum it's okay
so guys I hope you enjoy and I will
catch you later and as I say I upload on
Mondays Wednesdays and Saturdays so stay
tuned so my first tip is to you ladies
with the little booties and it is to
wear clothing that's got some additional
shape peplum is like the secret of
creating curves where there are none if
your bomber is flat and you know is
doing a disappearing act cover it up a
little bit write something that is going
to just caress your hips and just slide
over the flatness is going to create
some curves with it aren't and
necessarily any
so if you've got a square or slightly
rounded booty and so you might have a
little bit of something going on but you
want to make it pop that much more
high-waisted jeans are the most amazing
answer they're not so good if you
haven't got much going on but if you've
got a little something it's going to
create some extra curve and I was
feeling myself so we all know that black
is the ceiling color so the opposite is
for light colors if I matter your body
shape is great to wear lighter colors on
the bottom if you want to create and
accentuate any other bits of your body
that you're proud of
including your booty so I've seen one
piece trend look you know lots of girls
doing it and it's not necessarily for
everyone to wear a unitard I'm not a
huge fan of having my whole arm out
however what I love to do is wear
something like a jumpsuit I think
they're wearing something like an one
piece is a really flattering look and
creates really nice curves and no matter
your shape especially if you've got
quite wide hips a jumpsuit is a really
good option especially if it's like tie
up at the top like this one for my girls
of those extra wide hips and pear-shape
wide leg trousers are such a great way
to look really elegant I've noticed
girls say that sometimes they just feel
like they can't find anything that suits
them especially in the trouser
Department but wide legs are great
because they just give you at the hips
and are really flattering without
showing everything
so if you want to look like you've got a
booting you don't necessarily have one
basically leggings leggings are the new
form of trousers you can wear them in a
coffee shop you can wear them all the
time and yes they're going to make your
bum look good because it's basically you
in the nude but with like something over
it so it really accentuate curves and
every girl can fit into them because
they're stretchy so the girls lacking in
the carve Department if you're a V or a
square site from a great thing you can
do is actually to show your back if you
get something with a low bit of dip it's
going to create the illusion of curves
where there aren't any
and actually it's lovely to show your
back and hide a little bit of something
else and then if you've heard of
Colombian style jeans but this is
basically the secret taking pockets off
your trousers or jeans is going to make
your booty look really nice and juicy so
unfortunately there is no secret to a
round or perf bum there's no spray no
criminal oil no shake nothing that you
can take the size eating a healthy diet
right knee protein and salad that's
going to help you and also squatting in
the gym and like lunges especially with
weight if you're not using weights not
going to see as much of a difference so
guys those are some of my favorite hats
or girls of different booty shapes if
you guys have a favorite one please do
let me know for me ever using of these
tips you know leave it in the comments
I'd totally appreciate them anyway guys
thank you for watching and I'll catch
you in my next video
