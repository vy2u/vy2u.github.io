changed my look again we're gonna get
into this at another point in time
people you know what Patricia is like
okay I'm sorry if I upset it but today I
wanted to give you guys some tips on all
things diet and exercise
it's January beginning of the year I've
kind of been on a little bit of a
journey where I'm trying to like tone up
my body and just kind of work on it you
know it's not necessarily weight loss
but I'm trying to turn up my stomach my
butt and all those kind of things so
while I'm on this journey
obviously it's worthwhile for me to let
you guys in on some tips and tricks that
I am realistically finding useful
because there's a lot of you know pro
information out there and some of us are
just not pros okay so you guys know that
I'm a foodie and that when I see food my
eyes bubble out of my head and very
excited by it and I'm not all about diet
so one of the things I like to do is
substitution so rather than eating a big
plate of rice a rice mounting as I call
it I might have a rice mo here instead
and swap that out for like veggies and
fill up on them like a stir-fry
vegetables and like a splash of oil in
it and lots of seasoning because I like
my flute at least have a nice taste to
it and things like making healthy swaps
so I'm now not having as much bread as I
used to have and like normal bread and
now I'm using rice bread because it's
higher in fiber it keeps you full for
longer and different things like that so
you don't necessarily have to be like I
can't eat that anymore you know starving
yourself just swap it out for things
that are probably lower calorie and
better for your health number two is
portion control sticking with the diet
sad times people sad times you need to
really really manage your portions the
thing is though is that you realize that
we eat a lot just for the sake of kind
of eating so one of the things I like to
do is use a smaller plate to dish out my
meals so it doesn't feel like I'm
missing out on so much because I can
kind of have like a mini food Mountain
on my small plate that's a really good
way to trick your mind into not feeling
like you're eating this because
sometimes it's a mental thing versus a
physical thing because a lot
are in the habit of just eating loads
like I'm a little bit of an emotional
eater as well my next tip is to get a
meal plan diary those of you guys have
been watching me for a really long time
you know that excel like turns me off
and they make me feel so good so being
able to like organize my meals is like
oh it's so so good get a meal diary get
an idea of what you're going to eat for
the week when you go shopping rather
than going down like the hours with like
the biscuits and the jammie Dodgers and
the malted milks and all that tasty
goodness just go down the video okay go
down the meats and the foods are
healthier for you okay just do that
instead and build your meals around them
and it means that you're not going to
have those times they like I'm so hungry
or I'm just gonna go and buy a burger
I'm just gonna go to the kebab shop you
won't do that as much when you kind of
just when you like know what you've got
you've got the stuff in the fridge you
will be good to go for those of you who
want like an instant transformation or
you have like an event to go to or
something something that's going to
cause an instant shrink and I know a lot
of people don't believe that you can
instantly lose weight but there's ways
to like reduce your water which is to
basically reduce your salts and your
sugars and I'm talking like white bread
and all that kind of stuff that burns
causes really high insulin spikes for
some reason they cause you to be a
little bit bloated and to kind of like
hold a little bit more water in the
areas that are not the most attractive
like a little bit of a small head and
swole belly so even if you give yourself
like five days of the cleanse or like
really high salts and sugars you'll see
a significant difference and that can
kind of kickstart you into making a
massive change
so my next tip is moving on to the
exercise part and the part that I like
the most is obviously getting yourself
the gear okay realistically by getting
healthy and fit you are going to look a
lot better but you want to start off
looking good okay
you need to get your gym wear right and
I've been working with misguided who
have their new active wear collection
I'm going to link it all down below it's
gorgeous
it's affordable it fits really really
well and it's got great support this is
one of the tops on them honestly I
it's a great brand you guys to know that
whether I'm working with them or not so
for me to do something like this just
fills me with so much joy so check it
out below but having the right gear is
going to make you feel really good and
motivated and it's probably going to
make your butt look amazing this is the
next tip okay might sound a bit gross to
some of you guys but it's really not
that gross it's to sneak in your gym
wear okay and especially if you're
someone who's going to workout in the
morning and if you don't workout in the
morning they don't know where you're
going to do that but sleep in your gym
where one it's comfortable and two it
means that you have no excuses when you
roll out of bed you can't be that oh
I've got to go and get ready for just
sleep in it okay just get to bed wake up
and for some reason it will make you
feel like you know what I'm in it now
I'll just do my 15 minutes I'll do my 20
minutes something that I really like is
realizing that working out doesn't have
to be working out it doesn't have to be
like you know I do an hour and a half in
the gym three times a week
that is absolutely fine but it's about
kind of changing your mindset towards
exercise and I am like okay it's all
about energy in and energy out so any
little changes that you can do in your
life are going to make the difference so
getting off the train or the bus stop
all earlier and walking it rather than
walking up the stairs run up the stairs
rather than taking the lift take the
stairs there's so many different ways
that you can just add a little bit more
exercise and expel a little bit more
energy and in your life my next tip is
to find inspiration and I'm not saying
the inspiration that makes you feel
depressed about yourself when you see
girls of these abs and these bums that
are literally like stone no just don't
just don't get depressed okay find
realistic inspiration I absolutely love
YouTube I love Instagram for finding
really cool exercise people and all that
kind of jazz I'm going to link some
below
and I don't know just finding that
inspiration kind of motivates you to
basically you know get on it and at
least see right this is the goal that I
want to achieve keep it realistic though
so you don't end up in like a depressive
state okay
the next step is to get a crew okay you
don't want to do this alone okay it's
hard you need to be accountable to
someone or a group of people somewhere
okay
I'll be like what are you eating today
too like a couple of my other friends
they send me their meals all of that
kind of stuff no I like apps where you
can do I think people mentioned
MyFitnessPal obviously instagrams a
great place snapchat you know all of
that kind of stuff to just feel
motivated to connect with someone and
they're just going to tell you when
you're eating that burger they're just
going to give you that condescending
look that's kind of going to make you
put the burger down or maybe not it's
all about setting goals like realistic
goals that you can actually achieve and
not goals that will do motivate you but
goals that are realistic and tangible
that you can see and track taking
pictures of yourself beforehand it's
something that I'm doing right now I've
been taking pictures just so that I know
that I can see where I've come from and
even looking back on my older videos I
was a little bit over you know so it's
great to see when you have you know
achieved something and sometimes if
you've kind of slipped up a little bit
you can let oh I'm gonna slip in here
and then you'll be able to you know deal
with it and sort it out so guys those
are some of my realistic diet and
fitness tips again I'm not a pro or an
expert by am on a journey I love doing
journeys at the beginning of the year
and planning on sticking to it and
hopefully I'll be able to keep you
updated on how things go for me but yeah
that is it and if any of you guys are
joining me on like get fit with Patti

comments a lot of people watch my last
