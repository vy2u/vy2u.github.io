bit of red over here going on in the

anything it is just erm kind of really
elegant and this dress is from warehouse
and I bought it recently in the sable
barking yes I can I start show you from
my ways that their dress from far away
you can see the red lines that kind of
come from the very top here all the way
down on both sides is that the back is
always at the back so I didn't realize
and I'm wearing it with a black jacket
again because I want to stay quite
conservative here is with the black
jacket so I look quite smart quite nice
quite corporate you know for the first
day that's what I'm gonna do so Oh juicy
with the shoes after that because people
stick back
you see with the shoes by properly wear
it I'll probably be wearing it with
hills hi guys so it is Tuesday today and
I've decided to you know maybe dress up
a little bit more because it's like
Monday I'm a bit more conservative but I
thought if I had we put on another cute
dress this dress is from warehouse
I bought it recently and the thing is
that I bought it in a size 6
I'm not a size 8 so I'm virtually a size
10 but I was desperate to just have this
dress and wear it which I've kind of
succeeded in doing and it's just a net
play black dress I'm again roaming with
tights and with flat shoes on the way to
work and yeah I'll show you the whole
outfit ok guys so here is the dress from
the front and I don't if how much you
can tell that it's like really really
small and they've kind of done it to
cinch in the waist so the lining you
don't think actually like split the
lining I don't know if I told you it's
like a size 6 imagine your size 10 yeah
I really wanted this dress but yeah I
just picked the lining on the inside
oh yeah that's gay look I'm gonna you
know put my hair on it like that or wear
my jacket so it's a little slide the
flat shoes and everything this is what
it looks like from the front and it's
not this really cute detailing and
everything at the top so I wore it with
these kind of peach blaze of jeans from
H&amp;amp;M and it's kind of cinched in at the
waist and it goes really well with the
nice detail on the side there and it
just makes it look a bit brighter and
or spring you know the weather it's been
awful so guys I'll see you tomorrow guys
sorry it's Wednesday today and today is
like my favorite favorite outfit just
because like I went from all black and
I'm wearing like lots of not bright lots
of bright color but I'm definitely
looking a lot brighter and wearing a
white shirt today and I'm wearing like
Brown Libra trousers and belts and
really really cool shoes
the shirt is H&amp;amp;M and the shoes and mango
I mean you want to show you the shoes
cuz they're different is that the only
different pair I wear to work and this
coming this got this side cut out so as
you've been of what's this pickled side
foot cleavage that's what I'm gonna call
it sad for cleavage and I fit this a bit
hot I love them I love them so I'll show
you this outfit from like the back basin
okay guys so here's this outfit from
further back I am wearing and the brown
trousers and I love the fact that
they've got a pleat down on them and
they're slightly short but I actually
like that look of slightly short
charles's such anyway it looks like
further back and you can see my shoes
and a bit of their inside foot cleavage
I feel fairly confident with my pockets
you know here's what it looks like the
belt and what is that with the jacket
don't if I said the jackets from H&amp;amp;M
I'll show you from the back so they're
not too tight or too baggy they're just
enough I don't like wearing trousers
that look really mini time for work so
guys and I will see you later hi guys so
I'm probably getting a bit you know
excited I was being on trend in or
things--it's it okay it says eight today
and I thought more color today so wrong
dresses dresses on my idol thing to wear
because I think they look mean you any
feminine really pretty and I do love a
dress so this is a blue dress that I got
from it's like a little shift dress
which I got from Primark and
it just looks really any given expensive
and I am showing my whole arms but
usually I find that look well dressed
like this whatever put a blazer on top
of it and you're good to go so I'll show
you this it's got a touch of neon as
well so yeah she from far away okay guys
so here is the entire dress I really
really love it he has got lots of
movement it's really really nice so this
dress has kind of got pleats that are
folded into it which are just perfect
and here's them bright neon bell what
it's not neon it's like a bright yellow
and it's got a layer of gliding on the
inside as well so it's not too short and
I might not show you like me in my heels
but these are my work hills I've been a
quite trunk here and then really plain
black suede it's where this I go for
comfort in the style when it comes to
work shoes and these are my standing
work shoes so here's the outfit with my
jacket on and it's a blazer which I
think I bought for mine go or you get it
for a while but it is slightly big I
probably need to go in get taken to a
tailor to just make it a bit more fitted
but you know if you want a kind of
boyfriend style jacket this is okay okay
