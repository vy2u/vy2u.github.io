I do think it's a bit life for me if I'm
looking a little bit green not a man
hello beautiful people welcome to my
channel I hope you are doing well I'm
coming to you birthday feeling beautiful
because we're about to do a full face
one brand tutorial here and I'm gonna do
a full face of bourgeois yes bourgeois
makeup it is a drugstore burn so I did
make my way into boots to pick up some
goodies but I'm not gonna like in my PR
I was also sent a bunch of goodies as
well which I didn't know I was going to
receive that only picks up some stuff in
Boots but I wanted to do a full face of
bourgeois makeup so yeah bourgeois isn't
a brand that I have ever used before
like this is my first time ever using
boar I haven't bought it before I you
know they're not known for having shades
that necessarily suit me they are a
French brand but they are all over the
UK but I've seen a lot of guys I know
who say like this like the healthy mix
foundation the concealer is that some of
their favorites I'm like well I want to
get in I want to try it out and see what
it looks like and they reached out to
partner and I was like okay I'll try it
out and I'll give you my genuine opinion
on what I think this is actually going
to look like I always say like I'm
relatively dark like and there's a
couple of shades circling me but not
that many so if something's gonna work
for me then it might work for a
respectable amount of people but you
don't know okay let's get into this
video so this is the healthy mix
blurring primer and teeth fatigue and so
I think with this whole healthy mix
collection it contains vitamins that
meant to be good for your skin and you
guys know I love skincare what stuff
that's gonna make my skin look good so
this primer awkward look I put too much
on
so the primer is nine pounds ninety-nine
it contains it to me in see a b5 like a
radiant glow wonder if I feel looking a
little bit great well that's fine some
primers do that for you my question is
do my pores look a little bit more
refined yeah it's not as dry a primer as
some
I use it's giving me some mattifying but
not too much not too much I just feel
like it's gonna maybe give a nice base
before my foundation goes in play primer
on it doesn't matter if I can definitely
see that it's mattified me I feel quite
mattified and some on my paws around
here look a little bit more filled in
feel like I could do a little more than
actually it's nice it's like it's 999
I'm not mad okay so nice I'm gonna try
the healthy mix foundation again in
containing the vitamin c e and b5
nothing all that vitamins inside a
foundation I don't know what difference
it make but it's meant to give you a bit
more of a rating close this is shade
number 63 or state numbers disagree okay
I'm very excited because I could not
find the darker shades in store let me
show you the darkest shade I could find
in store was actually shade number 61
and I was a bit suspect on it I was a
bit like I'm not really sure but we've
got 63 here and that happens a lot I
find that you know sometimes you can get
shades or a brand says that they have
shades but sometimes they're just not in
the drugstore which can be a little bit
frustrating not even a little bit very
very frustration because we all want the
goods okay so put them in the store so
we can actually find them but this is
shade number 63 let us go in okay do you
think that it might be a bit dark it's
looking a little orange on camera but
trust me it's kind of blended might even
be a touch to God because I usually go a
little bit of a shade up in case it
oxidizes is quite of a wet formula ah
but it is radiant complexion so I would
get that definitely radiating it's got a
good coverage though I can tell because
I have this one scar there and if you
give me good coverage on that which that
just did it and how happy bunny
and that's actually giving me good
coverage and can you see the color the
colors blend it in really well since 999
but not madman
this is very radiant for like I look wet
because I'm often wear matte foundations
but I feel like V is changing and people
want that more like radiant look there's
such a balance between radiant and
greasy we'll see by the end of it if I
have met that balance you know you know
girl Wow
I actually think that looks really good
the coverage on that is so good right
here that is a scar that I have right
there underneath there and my silence is
it covered I'll be covered in there and
also in my beard my bid is kind of
blending in not bad you know that is
really nice I'm not gonna lie I do feel
like things are getting better at the
drugstore and that there are more
options they just need to be in stock
like come on I don't like going to the
store and not seeing them in stock but
hello options this looks good and you
know what I feel like the shiny nurse or
the wetness is kind of disappearing as
like the water evaporates not bad like
it's extending my holiday look okay next
I'm gonna go in with E let me see okay
looking at even my boots bag these are I
think the darkest shades this is the
anti fatigue concealer let's watch let's
watch maybe you can't judge from the
bottle it looks a little light let's see
on my eyes gonna not look tired it's
quite light coverage I've Mogollon I do
think it's a bit light for me that I'll
just see if we can blend this to Jesus
you know
you know it does disappear though it's
very light coverage it's not full
coverage so my foundation can come
through from underneath it's very light
for me I think that blended so easily
it's quite a sheer coverage super super
sheer but I think you can build it up
and you can probably tell it's a little
bit cold especially because my
foundation was so ripped I've been able
to make it work I feel like this
concealer is for the gold so you don't
have really dark circles and you want to
have just everything light like elevated
look versus like a cement beet face look
you know when I Drive a 56 and see if
that makes it different you can build it
up though you definitely can build it up
okay that is that's blended nicely what
I will say is that that concealer is
really really light I wonder how it
weighs I really do wonder how it wears
it's blended in really nicely
I don't look cakey at all interesting
I'm not gonna lie like this is quite
different from my normal that foundation
is like makeup this makeup that makes a
sense like I look kind of perfect if I
do say so myself
like there's no makeup on you can't you
can't see the makeup on my face but I
look so you put even I know my dark
marks are definitely covered I'm feeling
that I'm gonna go ahead and finish off
my eyes and then come back to you guys
okay I've just done my eyes I haven't
added anything to my face right now and
you can see how the makeups like blend
it in a contour just a little bit and
I'm gonna go ahead and add some powder I
just feel like I need just a touch of
powder because obviously like no one
goes out without putting some powder on
that's just weird
unless you do that and I'm like more
power to you
okay powdered feeling flawless feeling
flawless I think my contours and little
strong but we're just gonna roll with it
I'm just gonna go in with their blush
it's so cute why is this so dinky look
at this this is a shade could see you
know the one thing I have found oh it
smells beautiful
a fan of a lot of drugstore brushes and
stuff as they literally just don't show
up on me I feel like I should be a
borrower with this just a little brush I
don't know it feels very strange okay
we've got a little blush coming through
not mark the smell is lovely guys can
you see it this is actually quite a rich
and quite a warm this is like going to
work makeup I feel like not with the
eyes though and why so these I've seen
this so popular in the stores these are
the Rouge Edition velvet it's a map but
doesn't feel like a map let me put some
lines on my nips
that's a super girly pink color like
super girly pink but I'm not mad at it I
think it's actually quite nice see with
a little light lip liner I can wear any
color but without lip liner I look like
someone's aunty it's a matte lipstick
but it isn't even mattes you've been
giving a little bit of shine but the
color is really really pretty really
really pretty
oh the blusher coming through now can
you see that it's very subtle I look
very girly right now very girly
maybe not Parisian craze a French brand
well the rims dance of blood
okay guys that is my face done I've
gotta say I love the results I feel very
pretty and very feminine like you know
with my pink lips and my pink hair my
skin looks dull like my skin actually
looks dull like so maybe that healthy
mix foundation maybe was you know
actually doing something cuz it Joe it
looks like I've got no makeup on my on
my skin it's like flawlessly blended in
really really flawlessly I'm surprised
and my texture of my skin looks really
good but I did do my skincare regime
lost my I had to but maybe that's helped
but it looks really really good I've got
I've got to say very pretty very girly
maybe it's cuz it's bourgeois maybe come
there's a French brand that it just
bought that like elegant feminine energy
out of me and the concealer is a little
bit cold I'm not gonna lie it's a lot
colder than I would normally wear and
not as thick as I would normally wear
but it's blended in to make a nice look
I'm not mad I'm not mad and I'd love to
see that there are brands in the
drugstore just expanding their ranges so
we can actually wear them I think people
are starting to learn maybe I think
that's it guys do any of you guys use
bourgeois what's your thoughts on it
what are you gonna finish look in the
meantime make sure if I'm a me on my
Instagram my snapchat and all that good
stuff be interactive because it is
February every season and I will be
reaching out to you guys directly so
