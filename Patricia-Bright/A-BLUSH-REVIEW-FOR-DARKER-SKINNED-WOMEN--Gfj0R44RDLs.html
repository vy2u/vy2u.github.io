video is actually going to be a makeup
with you I don't usually do makeup
reviews or well of this line I don't
usually do ever done any makeup reviews
I actually do not have any products from
benefit but I'm hoping in future that
would change recently I went to a beauty
bloggers event where they actually had
products that they were saying that can
be used on women of color because after
we gonna stick to Matt could you think
that's what suits our skin or I kind of
stick to suni can Matt so they kind of
did some demos and stuff like that and
because of the bigger fits being they
were promoting or showing asked was the
better barber which is a new product in
their range so I was a bit skeptical and
I saw it I thought oh yeah it's
beautiful packaging packaging isn't
lovely lovely and then this is what the
blush looks like so I saw that my fault
that's gonna be a big light on me and
then they did you know some demos with
girls of color are Asian guys that goes
on now this shot so we also got it to
try it I'm I get loads of stuff to try
it from those different companies I've
just been good they don't sue me or
anything like that and I was like oh
gosh this looked a very nice on me it
looks good
this is what I'm wearing right now so I
hope you can see it is quite nigger
tonight and I've got it just across
there and it's not you know a bright
pink or like a baby pink on me I don't
anything that the way it comes out on me
is going to be different on the way it
comes out on the son of a lighter skin
tone or a white skin tone but it kind of
gives me a kind of golden glow kind of
really healthy iridescent good I was I
think that you know when you're going to
applying it even if you play it quite
close under your eye it also
as a highlighter as well temperature
free deep effects so you knowing how
foundation look like Matt no no this
kind of lifts in your face I was very
very very shocked and I loved it this to
me is going to be in my summer brush to
be honest I'm wearing it now already
even if I got every one every day well
so I have to say about it went on very
very smoothly the brush brush the brush
that came with it
this white brush which is the news is
beautifully soft beautifully soft
because you often you get packets or
compacts that night you just throw the
brush away no this brush is a keeper and
I'm sure I would use it for anything
else as well and yeah packages are very
nice it also has a mirror so you can
just use this on the go I love it alone
I'm surprised I'm very very surprised
because I don't think of benefit because
my takes what I think okay we're gonna
get some makeup or if I was going to
recommend a blush I would recommend the
sleek or a Mac you know everyone knows
the Mac brushes that we use but this
surprisingly looked really really nice
on me and I really really like it so at
least I can say you know we're in love
my skin tone and can use it and above
can use and probably bit darker could
use it as well so okay I hope you liked
that review it was really quick but I
just wanted to give you and
review what I thought about that product
so that's what denied by</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
