video is gonna be a review what an
initial review of this see Sedona lace
palette company
so just to let you guys know I was sent
this for free did not pay for this I
didn't really get any choice in what I
was able to pick and review so let me
just tell you kind of how it initially
when I saw that what I was being said it
was like a metallic palette and I my
gosh that not know that sounds really
ungrateful by thinking there's no point
in sending me I'm gonna tell Palace
because I don't wear metallic colors and
I I'm not really into it so I was
thinking oh I'm not really gonna be able
to review this because it's not gonna be
anything now I used I would have
preferred to have some brushes you know
some brushes to review but that's not
why I was given so anyway this is the
palette that it got and so I didn't
really have that much high expectations
for it when I got it but when I got it
this is what was in it and I was very
very very surprised and very was like
all phew
it wasn't what I thought it was gonna be
when I was thinking metallic I was
thinking it's gonna be all these really
shiny sparkly glittery things which it's
not it's not at all I know I love the
colors that was in it and I'm quite
surprised that it's it's as neutral it's
quite a neutral palette don't you think
and you guys know I'm not really into
bright colors or anything too elaborate
and I felt that this palette was was was
appropriate for that kind of thing there
so I can't review the whole palette
because I'm not used all of the colors
I've used it quite a few of them across
this round scale here and I especially
love this color now what I will say
about all of them is that they're very
very pigmented so I'll do a few swatch
it those are the two oranges
side-by-side ones a bit yellow B ones a
bit light on and then here's like a
coppery color and that's more I'm into a
more into the coppers more into the
Browns and they've even got kind of a
coppery red
which you could see a lot more now I
really think that this isn't this camera
is not necessarily doing it justice but
it's so pigmented it's unbelievable it's
like it's like using um what's it called
I don't know those pops of pink you know
a pigment pot actually yeah a pigment
pot is as as much I hope you can see
that is how bright it is it's really
really nice that list when I used it it
stayed on long and I didn't really use a
primer so I'm very very impressed and
you won't see me and anything there but
definitely on this scale of things
yes I've loved it and so so far I would
give this would I give this I would like
to give it a nine and nine out of ten in
terms of the quality of the pigment and
the colors that you get in the palette
and especially for the price I think
it's twenty four ninety nine dollars but
please check on the website or I'll
write the real price somewhere down
below but for the price for the colors
that you're getting if you like this
kind of color so this is what I like if
you don't like you know these kind of
colors it may not be for you and the
amount that you're getting in there this
is kind of a whole makeup collection in
just one palette which I really
appreciate and I really like the greens
as well actually if you guys want me to
review this further tell me what colors
you'd like to see to see me do or to try
on and I'll go ahead and do it but so
far I'll definitely give it out or nine
and nine out of ten I can't say 10 out
of 10 because I'm not really a makeup
person I want to be more of a makeup
person but I'm never going to do
anything to elaborate actually one thing
I will say this is missing is a black
and a dark brown so when I want to just
do a crease or something darker nothing
here really it can kind of fit that bill
for me because it is still as they say
the metallic palette
and I do need you know a nice matte
black on a nice matte Brown for my
crease which this doesn't have so
actually yeah that's definitely my
markdown for this but that's my quick
review and if you do want to do it you
do want me to do anything on it just
leave a comment below and I will do that
okay
