and it's actually going to be drugstore
yay I have never done a drugstore makeup
look before and I do have drugstore
makeup I just don't wear it as regularly
and for my videos but I thought why not
do one let's focus on that you see like
we are in the season of love Valentine's
Day is coming up and I'm sure many of
you are looking for looks to do so know
you enjoyed this video make sure you
thumbs up and subscribe if you're not
and make sure you check out my blog
Patricia bright book owk I'll see you
guys later bye
so guys I start off with using my
foundation and my drugstore foundation
of choice is the L'Oreal True Match and
it's basically in a color called
cappuccino but I find it is a great
winter color for me this is the only non
drugstore product it's their Kevin or
Kwan's ensure enhancer
it's my favorite concealer I love using
it to highlight under my eyes and on the
bridge of my nose in a couple of other
areas of my face
so next I use is my favorite it's a
sleek contour kit in dark as you can see
it's well used but I basically use this
at the size of my face to basically look
a little bit cinema and I usually do it
in a c-shape another great drugstore
product is sleek splashes they're
actually really good and really
pigmented and I got this little set
probably for about $7.99 and it's got
some great colors in there for my brows
I use the Rimmel London and brown liner
it's in a dark brown I love it it's got
a little brush as well that you can use
to shape your eyebrows and then just
pencil them in to make them a little bit
fuller and I also use my normal
concealer and an angled brush to
basically need to not round the edges so
I found this really amazing light Browns
and bronzes and kit from Maybelline it's
Maybelline glow and I thought these are
really pretty Valentine's Day colors the
gold is great on the lid and then
there's a bronze that is great to put
just in the crease to add a bit of
dimension
so this is another non drugstore makeup
product it's a nice crease color from
NARS it's kind of like a chocolate and
it's great just to add a little bit of
dimension it's not really a smokey eye
but it's kind of just a nice and deep so
to do a nice wind liner i use the
l'oreal super liner i think this is
probably one of the best
eyeliners that is out there it's really
really black it lasts a really long time
and it doesn't kind of go really watery
I love this liner and I just try to do a
nice little cat I love it
so next I use the lower volume million
lashes I think this is one of the best
drugstore mascaras that are actually out
there so I'm a big fan so I then just
apply my mascara as usual people say I
apply it weird but I think it's because
I'm really curly lashes and I always
want them to look like a little
straighter
so next I'm using a Mac lip liner it's
called vino and I haven't found a
drugstore alternative but it's a great
deep red that will really help the berry
of my lip gloss pop and this is a nice
berry which is from Revlon I love it and
you can basically build it up to get a
nice rich color
finally I love using the Girls Aloud
lashes they were actually on offer I
think it's like two-for-one or something
really cheap and I just used them to get
some added drama the Kimberly ones are
the best so guys that is my drugstore
Valentine's Day look I hope you enjoyed
and it gave you a couple of ideas and
don't fret if you don't have something
for Valentine's I'm sure I'm gonna try
and do something a little special for
all my single ladies so guys I will see
you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
