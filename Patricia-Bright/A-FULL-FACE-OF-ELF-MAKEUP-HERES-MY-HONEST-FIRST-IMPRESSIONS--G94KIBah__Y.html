am bare face because i wanted to do a
full face of elf
my car now i love in the life I've been
meaning to do this for months and I've
had a box just fit in there and I just
haven't done it yet but today is the day
I'm going to just try out a little
product from elf and make it work and
see what it's looking like on my skin
for you guys who it in the UK obviously
half of my photos are UK and I'm British
clearly shout out to England hey elf is
basically a US brands eyes lips face and
I think they were only sold online in
the US but they do not sell to UK so
that is cool but it is delivered from
America so when I ordered I'm turning it
took like two two and half weeks so I
before I got my order but they also sell
stuff in superdrug I think as well it
didn't have to pay any custom charges
because they have a UK website so yes
that's what I can say about eyes lips
face and they've got everything and it's
affordable like seven pounds of c-4
foundation you know two pounds of this
for purposes it is quite an affordable
brand and it's been around for ages when
I first started youtubing like elf was
one of those websites I only shot there
like once or twice and I'm talking about
about six seven maybe even eight years
ago so that was back then but today for
a new day and we're international baby
so we're ordering from all over the
world we've got everything everything I
both had was I broke it which is why my
eyes are filled in and also the
concealer because they had it in a
medium the medium was just looking white
so I just look there's no point in me
actually trying to do this because it's
been a struggle life so let's get into
it okay so person first is the oil-free
SPF foundation so these are the two
shades cocoa and espresso and initially
I bought cocoa and then I was like this
is far too right to me and so I ended up
picking up espresso but I feel like oh
it's nice and thick is very thick so
that this is only very young full
coverage I love that they've got a
little bit of packing
in belt-fed in it which is white can be
used as an SPF that's really sick all a
lot first impressions as well
hey we got a foot is precious but yeah I
just see this color think it was a
little light but you know what I'm going
to use both but I feel like enormous
ladies we kind of like to mix it all up
and see how it works
oh two different shades quite different
it's not going to lie I'm going to use
this beauty blender it's not even a
proper beauty blender and I actually
don't like this one but it's the only
thing and available I'm going to go in
with the darker shade first like
seriously that is blended in nicely like
really nicely
well the lighter shade is probably a
little bit too light I can use it around
me about the energy quite nice as a
concealer because the coverage is really
good on that
that's Breslau this is definitely more
than neutral color I just hope it
doesn't oxidize you guys know if it does
what is I don't know where this is from
I think from superdrug this looks like
the brick overhead and using my Real
Techniques one it's a little bit worse
aware that leaf isn't breaking my skull
as they use it no see the applicator
makes a difference you know you were I
wasn't getting the full potential as a
foundation with the other applicator but
I feel like that literally looks at my
skin mmm I'm going to go in with the
Coco's I'm screws that so highlight a
little bit because I didn't have a
concealer from them because their
concealer was a nose that actually is
very similar to my Kevin a Kwan overall
I am in Crest
that is drying down nice and matte the
color is nice I'm feeding that and it
was really thick as soon as I can tell I
knew it was going to be amazing I'm
feeling that put away it for the day and
see how it goes as well okay so next up
I have this palette here called the made
for matte eyeshadow palette and this is
made for Matt - I'm loving the colors in
there lots of warm neutrals which I am
about this is my life I also have the
brush set as well it's actually really
affordable for brushes
and on the light I have already used the
small angled brush to try and do my brow
I'm going to do it was trash the
bristles are too long it is too soft for
brow that's just a heads up I'm going to
use this too let's do the rest
this is the eye shadow see brush and I'm
going to go in with this I don't know
what shade is all honestly I just touch
them once and they pick up a lot of
product a lot I'm surprised I feel like
that is super pigmented now what it
looks like on my lid isn't what it looks
like okay because this looks way lighter
in here and then it does on my lid we've
got some good payoff here it's super
matte so like it's just sucking up all
the weight on my eyelids right now I'm
going to go in with one is the lighter
colors here I'm going to add a touch of
this Brown here I'm using the contour
brush it's a face contour brush that
would be a bit late but it's called the
contour brush to add a little bit of
dirt I am impressed I am impressed
that's actually going through my life
you know current everyday favorite kind
of palette okay so I also bought a
liquid liner this is the ink liner in
blackest black I will say this packaging
isn't fantastic is very simple but you
know I'd rather you have simple
packaging and your product is good no my
hands are very look no spilling no
spreading now the reality is that only I
can f this up right now but is so good
and I'm telling you that I had two left
hands right I'm not even good at doing
my not the eyeliner is amazing it's
really really good it's really really
good I can't believe it I'm very very
impressed by that eyeliner right now hey
okay so I've also got the volume
plumping mascara again the packaging is
really
to simple on the items and the wand is
literally bone-dry there's nothing on
the ones I persisted on it's really
needing to be work mm-hmm you know what
it's given me some coverage I'm not a
fan of the one it's too big it's really
big and it's really straight just
overtaking my eye and I feel like I'm
having to pound it evening pretty great
so I feel like I have to pound it into
the bottle to me the Lascar is and I
notice it's not it's not good
the scar is dry the lash the brush is
too big and I just almost picked my eye
out so I don't I don't like that I
bought lashes I bought two pairs of
lashes from ELF
and I've Alaska I'm a bit of a large
lash not to be honest with you and they
even had lash glue I'm not about to use
that lash glue there are pretty spell
lash nice from far but up close a bit
plasticky but you know I would still
wear them out I would actually still
wear them out I've got a little beauty
bond but I like a lot more so yeah but
overall this face is looking okay they
have a cream contour kit as well I
believe that this is the dark one I'm
really really hoping that the dark in
this kit is dark enough sweaty can you
see that it's got moisture it's like
sweating right they don't have a contour
brush that they've got a angled
foundation brush which is nice that's
dense yes that's little emo skin shade
so the struggle remains that isn't a
contour me so sure and this is the
darkest one so you are a jar then this
is not going to contour you that's not
fortunate because the color witness is
really nice this basically foundation
basically foundation but as you see that
has brill ended in spec nothing ever
happened that's got it so we're just
going to put that aside
two different powders here this is the
HD peridot and this is a share and then
this is a luminous powder as well I kind
of didn't want to go too crazy and they
both come with a poof which i think is
really cute I thought use a person ages
that has sucked up any kind of shine
Wow my child is usually have color in
them so this is a little strange for me
and I'm just going to try the numinous
powder on the other side actually for
like this powder was nicer than the
other powder and this is the luminous
one I did like that one as much as you
like it was a bit harder to blend in a
bit patchy err
where's the other ones actually quite
shearing quite light but I will say it
really sucked up the moisture in my face
and maybe a bit more than I was normally
like but let's just add some this is add
back some stuff don't we need that right
now
this is the base highlighter and the
color is blush gang or mega fan brush in
the brush kit and I'm hoping this is
going to just have me shining shining
shining shining shining you okay we're
not picking up anything listen this is
either trash or something but
something's not working it's very very
subtle I'm actually grinding my brush
into this okay we're getting a little
something okay here we going it all till
you guys feel like it just needed a bit
of warming up they did my lights are
blasting it hour a little bit it's very
subtle and this shade isn't great for me
I need something warm ah okay next up is
the blush palette here the shades here
just going to go for the darkest one
oh god no no it's not funny
he's not on me sorry I didn't like that
so for my next I'm going to go in with
either wine or dark brown I want to see
what they look like on the dark brown
isn't that around cats dark brown
there's a packaging mix-up and that
isn't a dark brown so no however I'm
going to try the wine I wish it was a
touch deeper to be honest this wine is
actually looking more like a pink and
isn't whiny or me at all at least it
would have a bit more of a red but very
pink I'm going to go in with my
bittersweet that's more like a dark
brown okay and I'm going to go in with
this lip lacquer the shade is natural
that natural is like a white they don't
blend in though say that natural is a
little bit stock when it went on well
blended in with my brown liner it's okay
it has a very very strange smell for me
but since I looked good on and then I'm
gonna finish off with the makeup mix and
5th grade this is a clear spray and this
is raved about this and the primer I do
know about as being really good so let's
see so so that's what my face needed
that it's finished I'm feeling it I'll
be honest I feel like I look a little
more on the pink cast less neutral sides
and I normally look normally I look a
lot more yellow a lot more rich cuz
that's why my preferences when it comes
to foundation the makeup I like to look
just even more chocolatey but I think it
looks good everything's come together
nicely and for the price of the elf
items I'm shocked to how they are
they're very very good it's definitely
worth to try I don't think it's a waste
of money I do think that's a little bit
difficult when you're on the website
because you're not sure the shade as you
can see that happened when it came to
need picking the miners and
but other than that try it I'm at it I
am a fan
okay guys at the end of this tutorial
for face of elf I hope you found it
useful if you're not pulling me away

check it out ok guys see your come day
