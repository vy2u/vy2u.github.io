feeling like I look extra super glad
because this hair is curly and I've got
red lipstick on so I'm really really
sorry
and I am using a new camera so it might
look a little bit off-key and really so
if it does I will sort it out with Taif
but today I'm going back to classic and
it's going to be a whole video so as I
always say get a cup of tea and get
comfortable and this this hauls going to
be a little bit mature there's a little
bit of underwear and goodies like that
in this hole just because I kind of went
through like a refresh and I went
through my closet and I just threw away
like basically all of my old underwear
I've had enough of you I don't want you
anymore and just bend it and I was like
people probably do this like once a year
or once every six months
and I really feel like that's something
that I really want to start doing I
don't know if any of you guys ever do
that but just been all your underwear
and just start to start afresh or
something but yeah I definitely felt
like the old undies had to go but I'm
gonna get started first stuff is from
tennis which is this kind of underwear
store it's European but they do have it
in London and they had really good cells
on Everywhere's have really good cells
on it sitting in first thing I wanted to
show you was this a one piece like
bodysuit that I picked up and I love it
because it's got this kind of sexy mesh
in the middle which you can have a
little bit of cleavage on show but the
thing like the mesh is that it kind of
covers it up so you can't really see
that much boobie em in it so I really
like the way that looks and I'm wearing
this to Glastonbury where I would have
already worn it so I'll see if I can
insert a picture before this goes live
but that's basically what it looks like
down the center it's super super cool
and they basically had the undies and
I'm just going to show you a few of them
but they've got underwear for I think
it's three for nine pounds ninety-nine
and I basically bought like twelve new
pairs because they're so so nice and
they're made out of this that really
soft material which is really nice on
your bomber I know these kind of
like granny panties they're not they're
kind of more like you know the boyfriend
shorts they really fat fit really snug
and what I like about these is that they
are seamless I bought it in the nude I
got a pair in the black they are quite
small so if you got a little bit of junk
in that trunk or girls you might need to
get yourself a medium to large even if
you're like relatively small and maybe
go to have got some extra junk in the
trunk might need to go for extra large
because they are quite small as you can
see but yeah those are those I do have a
few more this is a super sexy pair a boy
I don't know I'm showing you but it
doesn't really matter but they were
super cute enough on sale for like two
pounds of 99 but they're made of a
really nice sheer mesh right and then
obviously I'm not going to show you
these on and I really hope there aren't
many guys watching this oh my gosh it's
so awkward okay let's get it so kind of
looks like that right but then it has
like the - the double straps so they
look really nice and cute and then it's
clear mesh at the front I wish it was
kind I wish they had like bikinis like
this without the sefer at the front
clearly you don't need everyone to be
see your vajayjay but you get what you
get what I means and then another thing
that I'm absolutely in love with I've
just kind of gone a bit angular crazy
but are these kind of mesh or the lacy
bralette and what I love about them is
that you can kind of wear them under or
over and so this is the eyeball and it's
kind of got the silky satin just here
and then it's got the lace just around
the boobie but the extra sexy bit is
that there's just this little gap there
which means that you print your boobie
that kind of peeks out of it and it's
super super cute but if you don't want
it to be you can kind of push it
together and you won't see it I do kind
of think you can wear this as outerwear
but say you know how people were like
crop tops and bra let's that with a
blazer and like a high-waisted skirt I
think it's actually quite a nice look so
I might try to wear this in a really
really careful way and for those of you
are under 21 I don't think you should be
wearing these so next I want to move on
to Topshop I feel like Topshop becoming
wife like one of my favorite stores over
and over
and so very happy with them the first
things first is this absolutely gorgeous
bas da which underwear outerwear who
knows nowadays I saw this and I thought
this is absolutely gorgeous and I just
think it's so so sexy but again this
could be sexy underwear and if you want
to wear it in a really cool way why
can't this be outerwear if you cover it
up and I just love the way it looks I
love the shape of it and everything and
I think this was how much was this this
was 25 pounds so it's relatively
expensive if you want that one off like
you know it's sneaky bit this is just
gorgeous I absolutely love love love
these shores I've been living in these
shorts and it's the whole sports luxe
kind of thing I love I love gray I love
black and I love white and yeah I love
these look at them and they fit so so
well and they're so comfortable like oh
my gosh look how crazy I look coming up
to the camera like that
sorry guys yes another thing I kind of
bought all this stuff from the same
section that was like a sports lap
section which was absolutely gorgeous
like the visual merchandising was done
perfectly so I ended up buying so many
things but please take a peek at this
skirt it's made of the most lovely
lovely material it's like squidgy it's
like squidgy it's not nearing it's
something else but it's just gorgeous I
love the color I love the zip at the
back and I can just totally see me
wearing this this summer but also for
autumn as well just because of the color
I don't know what it is about black and
a mesh but I'm obsessed with it
I found this tea the tea does have an
insert in it as well so it's not just
like this and but I've lost the insult
already somewhere but this is the insert
and the tea is so so cute again it's a
great summer piece but a great winter
piece but I feel like I have a lot of
tops like this I'll see-through and it's
become my new thing that you can see
this dress here which is launching
inside I just love like things that are
mesh or netted I don't know why I love
it
it makes me happy finally I bought this
jumper as well from the same section and
can see the trend of mesh is not going a
miss it's got a mesh sleeve there and
yeah I just like it it's really
comfortable I think I'll go with you
over that actually the shorts though now
I'm going to move on to XI inside you
guys know I've shopped there quite
regularly the thing was she inside there
because it isn't international online
site it does take a really long time for
delivery I'm telling you that I ordered
this stuff probably about a month ago
and I only got it right this week but I
don't mind because I often know that you
know and buy my stuff I'm thinking about
what everyone know just leave it there
so I'm like I knew that I want to dress
it so I went and bought whole bunch of
new dresses especially for the
summertime which is what I wanted so the
first thing I thought was this candy
pink sports lap dress it is super cute
and it's made of like a jersey material
and I just want you know what it's quite
fun I never I really like fun and pink
things like this but but why not you
know you need something like this in
your closet I wanted like a few
different summer dresses so I picked up
this white one it's funny because I
ended up forgetting that I picked this
up and ended up buying a different dress
from another side that looks very
similar but it's got a nice kind of bow
at the neck and it's like ruched all the
way down next I love this on the model
on the site is this criss cross cobalt
blue dress and it's kind of like Rara in
shape and it's really nice on it it's a
little bit short for me and I did get I
think I got the small and or maybe even
the medium I think no yeah I got this
morn in it so maybe that's why but I
think it's really flattering especially
if I've got a barbecue or something to
go to I feel like this is going to be a
great piece and then picked up this
black dress is all that just seems so
90s to me because it's kind of got that
90 shape with the neckline and it has
the double strap as well super
flattering and you can't go wrong with a
little black dress I also picked this
bright bright bright yellow dress I
thought the neckline and the shape was
really cute I love the beading that's on
it as well
sometimes I'm trying to add stuff to my
closet that is a little bit more
different than usual and that's what
that looks like a completely you've got
this dress is also from she inside I
love this dress it's kind of like a
rah-rah in in shape and as I said it's
got this kind of mesh clear bit here
which is like my go-to look nowadays
especially in black so I love it and you
can do it all the way up like this let
me show you how cute is that it spoke to
you isn't it I love this dress I am
absolutely in love with ever Ireland one
because they took me and a group of them
other amazing bloggers on a trip of a
lifetime to Ibiza and they treated us so
well it was so much luxury I'll put a
link to my blog post on it in my
description bar below but not only that
is that this stuff is just really really
good and getting so much better and I've
been buying some major key pieces from
there so I quickly go and show you what
I've got the first thing is this skull
which has got pair of shorts underneath
and then it's kind of got this lace
overlay this I wore on the trip so so
gorgeous I also saw that SHINee had it
and she literally voice so so fast it
looks fabulous on her and I was like yes
hunty I keep saying that it's my my new
thing oh my gosh help me guys but yes
she wore it so beautifully I was black
she wore white so you can put it with so
many different things so that's that
skirt next is this blazer but I bought
sometimes like I love a white blazer and
I love a black blazer like you can't go
wrong with it
but I wanted to pick up one that was a
little bit different to normal I hope
you can see it but it's kind of got all
this floral print on the front of it
that just gives it like a really nice
elegant touch next
is this a neon green top which is
gorgeous the color is absolutely lovely
and I wore this on the shoot that I did
out there this is such a really nice
piece and again it's got that nineties
neckline that I really love I know the
river island bikinis are to die for
I've got the this bikini which is from
their pasture range and what I love
about it is that it's got a little bit
more than you know
so there's like an extra panel here and
then the beginning bottoms I'll show you
these they're bikini bottoms are also a
lot higher so you can't see your belly
button so it's kind of like wearing a
full piece but not and it's very much
vintage in style again I will link it in
my description bar below you can check
out my post wearing it you can check out
my Instagram it's all on there with me
in this so so flattering especially for
the girls who aren't necessarily
comfortable showing everything when
they're like out on the beach this kind
of gives you a little bit more more of a
cover-up you know I'm really not playing
with color I picked up these sandals and
very very comfortable so I picked up the
orange pair they look like that and I
can actually wear this all night but
they've got them in silver black white
loads of different colors so next is my
baby it's a misguided misguided has been
given me so much life I've been wearing
so much of this stuff the first piece
and again you guys must check out my
blog is Patricia Bridal code at UK like
if you don't see all my outfits and my
look on my blog on I mean on YouTube
they'll always come up on my blog at
some point in time but this one for
instance I did a blog post called palm
prints surrounded by history this is
this amazing two-piece isn't it gorgeous
I am in love with this they just look so
nice together and the great thing about
it is that it's just it's not too fitted
it's not too cost of phobic it's just
super comfortable and it's made out of
this in a print and fabric so it's so
durable another jumpsuit is this one can
you imagine how vibrant in color it is I
saw this on the sides like yes this is
totally for me I love the color and of
the fear and I love the shape of this as
well and then poor bought this dress
which the hanger really doesn't do any
justice it's from the Nicole Nicole's
line at misguided because I just wanted
a really nice sexy going out dress and I
think this is just in this I don't have
anywhere to actually wear it to but I
saw Bev out later and these are a bit
messy now because I've worn them so many
times but it is these perspex Andals
which have got the blue strap like this
and
he is all clear I'd be wearing these so
much and I just love the way they look
and actually they're reasonably
comfortable this kind of starts to hurt
a little bit after wearing it but you'll
be good you'll be fine
and finally it's two more bits from Zara
it is and these shorts these white
shorts which are just gorgeous they're
more like culottes I bought these in the
sell how much did I pay for these I
don't know I don't know why I paid for
these but they were in yourself laughs
in over 15 pounds from 30 pounds and
they're just made of this really thick
white material absolutely gorgeous I'm
so glad by cop leagues there are still
and then these boots these bad boys I
have since I bought them I've basically
worn them every single day
and that's how we know that I really
like something these boots here are just
gorgeous they've got this gorgeous
cutout he'll open toe but not too much
open toe sometimes you can have an open
toe which is just giving you like just
two middle fingers up but this is like
I'll show you a little bit of toe you
know a little bit of tell you need to
paint the front two toenails as well
which is what I sometimes doing it let's
get over here but I love these they're
so flattering and they're actually very
very comfortable
I think these may be my favorite shoes
like ever finally two more things one
it's my Marc Jacobs um it's the daizy
dream perfume this is only available at
world duty-free at the moment and it
looks absolutely amazing and smells
divine but for me it's like the
packaging just it's just so so gorgeous
and then it's my ray-bans you guys have
been asking me a lot about these red
bands and yes I bought these again at
duty-free and you can even see my tripod
and my camera there a mirror they look
so cool don't they they are mirrored as
well so you can kind of see a reflection
in them and I'm not I don't know what
the designers called nope no detail
sorry guys but this bit silver and then
these bits are mirrored you may be able
to find them at
I come sunglass hot or something like
that I can't even remember where I
bought them they were just duty-free
because we might both bought like
matching pairs of our first-rate band so
that's that guys so guys that is
basically my haul I really hope you
enjoy I'm going to have more videos

Wednesday I'm trying to be as consistent
