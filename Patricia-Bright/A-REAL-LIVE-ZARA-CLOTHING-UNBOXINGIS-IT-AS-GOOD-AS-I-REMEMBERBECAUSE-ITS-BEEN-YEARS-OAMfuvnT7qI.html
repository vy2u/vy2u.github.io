cheapskate are you cute you took your
girl you cute that I missed you baby
you lovely people welcome to my channel
I hope you are doing well today I'm
feeling a bit comfy and cozy and I
wanted to do kind of like a live
unboxing from some goodies that I've
bought online one of the number one
places that you guys have been asking me
to shop has been Zara
and you know what you know we've been on
there you know crazy online websites and
jazz you know she wronged me if as you
know all that jazz and do you know what
it was so good to just go back and shop
on the high street I'm gonna be a
hundred thousand percent honest with you
guys why most of the stuff that I've
picked up from a lot of these websites
like a lot of it I've ever taken back or
a lot of it I haven't been able to take
that and I feel like I've wasted money
I'm gonna be honest with you you like
genuine me and I feel like lots of us
feel that way like you buy stuff and
it's actually not good and you don't
really like it and it's just crap and
it's sitting in your wardrobe and I feel
like because I've obviously been like
reviewing different website and stuff
and I look at my wardrobe and I'm
decided this is so pants it's so rubbish
so I know it's that you guys are left
you should yours are more like spring
summer what can you friends are so I was
like you know what I'm gonna go shopping
so ah it felt really good if I could
come home a little bit so I've got my
good news I won like I kind of went ham
what is quite a lot you know
the box is who mungus and it's really
heavy they packed it densely in there
and frankly how I actually use the Zara
app to shop which seem to be quite good
I can tell you now but I haven't shopped
in Zara for over a year and are like
genuinely like that's how long it's been
so no we're just gonna unbox what I
bought from Zara together and hopefully
it's cute
I'll be honest I want to be like that
and this you baby
we have this cute little mustard blazer
I forgot fit this up is so funny I was
like looking online sites and I really
want a nice blazer this is a gorgeous
little number I love the color and I
feel like I look really good in this
kind of yellowy color and I love the
material that looks so nice the black
buttons are cute and I feel like I could
put a belt around this and make this a
hot little item yes why have I got to in
here I'm excited because I'm mad I've
been in the market looking for just a
nice black blazer like just wanting a
nice one and for some reason I have to
in here or maybe I pick them up in
different sizes just a plain black
blazer but can you see it's got this
like satin lapel detail going on but to
be honest I feel like a nice classic
black blazer is something that you can
just wear jeans a t-shirt and a black
blazer and look you and I've got
business to do I've got meetings to do I
want to look suave and sophisticated if
you guys want something like a what
lookbook or you know like a boss look
but let me know because I feel like if
you're not gonna move for that kind of
stuff this is a really nice place yes I
picked up these shoes so some of you
guys might have seen the trend for like
more chunky Rudi thick trainers and
stuff like that and I like buying into
trends of stuff but listen I'm not going
to go and buy 400 pound 500 pound pound
with the lips I'll goes until I know
that I might look cute in this look you
guys know I have big feet I am a size 41
that's working you a size 10 and I'm
only five foot four and a half so I've
got a long boat fee and these were 39
pounds so I don't think that was that
bad at least to see if I like it in a
really light weight and I'm excited are
you cute yet take your girl you cute
it's it's is this me or is everything
expensive Christ I've become a
cheapskate you know but you know and
this is why I've been over shopping
because the stuff is so cheap but it
just my new room life prices you
probably are not going to be shopping
regularly so this is a
is this cashew or something because okay
so we'll jump up I love the shape of
this jumper it was or and it feels
divine this is 69 pounds oh it's got
that gorgeous little funnel neck I love
a funnel neck jumper sometimes you just
got to I think the shape of this is
really buff it's really really cute and
I think it's gonna look amazing on with
some light light denim or like some
boyfriend jeans and then little heel oh
okay I don't know what this is is this
it yes or is this a no it must have been
started really well on the website for
me to pick up this thing because I'm not
sure I'm not I'm not really sure and
I'll be honest a lot of the times I
don't actually buy any bags on any like
high street stores or website because
you know I'm a little bit bougie I do
like to buy designer bags here and there
but you know I only buy one once or
twice a year so um maybe three times if
I sell like a bag or something what do
you guys think let me know in the
comments but I feel like you could make
this into a look maybe oh okay love a
little crewneck top love a little
crewneck I love the material I feel so
good for sucker to be home this is only
19 pounds this is only 19 pounds and I
love the sleeves I love the fact that
you know sometimes I don't wear lots and
lots of colors and lots and lots of
patterns but what I do like is there to
be a pot and I think that this has got a
really nice pop I love the length of the
sleeves as well this is gonna be so Co
you on this is one that I'd wear with
either some like jogging bottoms or like
some trousers or black jeans beautiful
love the color I love the fabric I love
the sleeves I love the neckline of this
I'm not sure how much this is actually
going to suit me sing in person and I
did test I did test buying in let me
just put it out there I don't iron I do
not iron what is an iron why I know I
hate iron in but this looks like it
requires ironing it it takes work I hate
coloring that takes work but maybe it's
a new day Nick day for me you know like
now I need to like you know I include
I'm like fatty I need to be able to I in
my own clothing like geez I know we'll
see about that
this has given me slightly like Little
House on the Prairie vibes slightly more
man desk but you know Mormon might be a
trend
no offense any movements by the way
y'all got great stuff so looking at this
I picked this up I'm not sure I'm not
I'm really not sure actually this is 12
pounds listen some see my bargain hunter
person coming out I'm not a star pilot
so I'll keep it this is quite cute with
a little brown lip underneath and some
jeans I do like the red neckline here
and if you guys know like last year in
the year before I just anything I was
mesh I was in it for some reason I was
kind of obsessed with it I think I think
this could be a look I think this could
be it
love this are so in love so now let me
tell you why this is so fabulous look at
that it's just unique I love little tops
that I've got something kind of cute or
kind of different about it and this is
only 15 pounds it's got this round neck
it's got an exposed shoulder and as I've
mentioned many many a time like you know
if you don't got boobie you got a
shoulder you got a clavicle darling so
this is a clavicle darling type of top
right now it's got a little bit of
design something cute about it but also
kind of simple as well I'm really
excited for wearing like boyfriend jeans
this year and just you know adding a bit
more volume around the bottom and just
wearing little cute tops like this to
pair with really simple buttons I am
excited
love that do you not identify it I think
that bought a skirt and that is what my
closet needs so nice skirt I want to
start bringing my legs out wear some
boots you know you know I have all right
legs if I do say so myself
but I've literally stopped wearing
skirts this is a gorgeous white shirt
I've got a thing about my shirt so I
don't like my shirts to come up really
really close because you know I've got a
little bit of a peanut head and I feel
like buttons that go like that and when
the color is really high it just makes
my hair look even more peen
right and just really small so and like
my shirts to almost be like this top I
like them to be slightly open but that
they have to be low but they just need
to be open like you can't be all
gathered here like you know a Catholic
schoolgirl and I went to school where we
had to wear this shirt button all the
way up to the top and it gives me
nightmares this is such a nice shirt and
look at those chunky little buttons tuck
that into a jean type that into a little
skirt and you will be good to go
I love that and it's kind of like sheeny
not shiny shiny not shiny is it is a
lifestyle yo guys she need not shining
hello little sexy weds up I'm not sure
about this cuz why doesn't it have
sneeze it does look nice I love red and
lover tops I wish it had sleeves just it
could be quite exposed I wonder what
that's gonna look like on but I love red
I love what I look like in red I think
this is gonna be really cute I love the
V but I have a feeling that this isn't
gonna look amazing on me it looks like
the V is really low and yeah it's also a
bit flimsy this is 15 pounds but it is
quite flimsy I bought more shoes
oh girl these be looking like some not
to make a mockery but they kind of look
like some Homa slippers like what kind
of homeless no back for are these mmm
how much are they
30 pounds you guys you actually lied but
I think they're actually they are
actually they are these are not going to
work in England Patricia what are you
thinking I know probably the reason why
I bought these is because I found that
there are days when you just want to
literally put on a skinny jean put on a
flat and walk out and I haven't had a
nice pair of put on a flat that can walk
out I used to always buy the Topshop
shoes that were on the peg and mine I
just you know that that they're over
right now so I think I want it just some
flat shoes I can throw on with it like a
little skinny jean and go I think I need
to see what these look like they might
be okay I'm not entirely sure let me
know what you guys think I wanted this
shirt for the long game
oh I feel like it's shirt season right
now for Patricia it has got this like
piping detail and it's all about this
like military or like it's like a boiler
suit trend and I've wanted this shirt
for ages it's 39 pounds I love the light
white piping detail on all the like
stitching I just forget that's fantastic
honestly fantastic and as you can see
it's a cup white color shirt which is
right up Patricia Street this is going
to look so cute tucked in one out
cuteness oh it's got a matching pant and
I bought it I don't never wear them
together would be doing the uttermost
but I might try it but I'm not sure that
these are going to be a keeper and also
the pant is a wider leg so it's gonna be
quite interesting to see what this looks
like on so I also picked up some cheese
I don't know why I picked up jeans from
Zara I extremely extremely even in the
past rarely ever bought jeans from Zara
right because no no you're not amazing
and I always by Topshop jeans but you
know it's a new day it's a new dawn
these mum jeans I saw them on the
website that 12 pounds are you crazy
that cannot be 12 pounds I don't believe
it it cannot be 12 pounds it's a knife
now they're not 12 pounds they can't be
there's no chance then it now I need to
just check let me just check because I
don't believe this they're not 12 pounds
why is it labeling on this wrong
these are says $12.99 they're 25 pounds
25 pounds is still a bargain though
let's not lie mumfie light blue jeans
really really nice for me personally I
have to be very careful when I do wear
this stylo Jean because sometimes it can
make me look just shapeless because I
know I'm slightly toothed shape you guys
know this I don't have a really small
waist or anything so I can look even
more boxy but you know there's ways that
can style it and also just being careful
with the footwear that I wear to make
them look cute but they're nice thick
hard denim I love it right here we have
another pair of jeans these I mean I've
got lodgings I'm not gonna lie I have a
lot of Topshop jeans so I wanted to try
some new jeans
I'm not sure I think about these I think
these look a bit my bit we're not great
but you know I think I'll leave those
finally I picked up these absolutely
gorgeous shoes in person I'm not a huge
huge huge fan of these actually I feel
like I might want to see what these look
like on on they might be fantastical and
look cute but they are looking a little
bit low for me and but I wanted
something that's a bit extra and these
do look a bit extra back in the day I
used to always always always always buy
like Zara high heels because I really
felt that they fit me and they look
really nice nowadays I mother might I do
like a designer shoe shoes and bags I
like to spend my you know my money on my
coin on but these look all right on the
website on again let's see what these
look like on and then they might be okay
but it's not they're going home
fine oh I bought some sunglasses I know
I'm not different these were only 12
pounds or 15 pounds oh darling these are
my darling glasses I'm actually trying
to get a pair of like Jimmy's it's like
Oh Jimmy's I think so but these look
fabulous darling I've been actually
really flattering for my face I know
they're very trendy but you know what I
don't mind some trends especially if
I've been here to spend 15 pounds in it
you know it's not that it's not that bad
as enable swings from side to side so
guys that is it that is me just doing a
little bit of an unboxing from the high
street and you guys wanted to see what I
liked in Zara that was one of the most
common comments that I got from you guys
do with Zara Hall so yeah I like it I
feel like a lot of this stuff could
easily come into my closet as of now I'm
getting rid of all that flippin tap that
I've got in there like honestly I just
think the so many clothes in my wardrobe
I literally don't wear and I don't even
have outfits that I want to put together
so I feel like there are a lot of pieces
here that I'm like you know what you're
coming in my main cross it we're gonna
get worn you know I still probably still
buy it a few other bits in there I still
got some websites to review and stuff
but like you know I like to store the
words that are not good
it's been a while and you've been good
for me it's good for the old mama it's
good to be old
so guys that is it for me I hope you
