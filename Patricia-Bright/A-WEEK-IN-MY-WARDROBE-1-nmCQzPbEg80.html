something a little bit different and
start to share a week in wares with you
guys just so you get an idea of the
outfits I wear and maybe what I'm doing
throughout the week or over the last
couple of days I really hope you enjoy
this video might make you a little bit
hungry because I love eating but and
yeah I'll catch you guys soon so on this
day I basically just pop to the market
and wore my favorite kind of outfit is
always a skinny jeans and a leather
jacket and I love this top but it's got
the polka dots on it and it just adds
some extra pop to my look
so as you know the weather has been
absolutely crazy I loved it
pop down and it's time to go get some
coffee and meet up with friends and do
that meeting with my sister this day and
I just wore this little dress and this
long line cardigan don't watch the
pot-bellied okay I need to start working
out again but yeah it's just a super
casual look or
so Saturday I just ran some errands in
the city I just usually got on the train
because I'm train go and I hate riding
into central London and I'm basically
getting laser hair removal and stuff so
I just went to the clinic on this day
skinny jeans and always but I've got
this really cool tie front top on as
well so hot don't even need a jacket I
love it
finally someday is the super chill day
for me I keep it local but I love these
gorgeous skinny jeans they're super
super skinny cut off just at the ankle
let's work with this Ollie's jacket just
turn you know give myself a little bit
of protection from wind and I basically
went to go buy some new candles I hadn't
prayed with this I can't stop myself
from doing it it makes it so good but
that's basically it
so guys that is it for my week and
where's I'm probably gonna try and do
this maybe once a month or so if you
like videos like this that we'll know a
bit more real life outfits then let me
know and I will catch you all later
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
