and it is a London edition as lots of
people are enjoying this summer and I
thought I'd share some of things I've
done in City recently so I hope you
enjoy so first things first if you
haven't been to the restaurant on the
roof of Selfridges you have to go it's
gorgeous in the summer and it's open to
everyone as basically in Selfridges
because I went too much of the fellow
yellow collection for the minions film
and they basically have a fashion
collection which is absolutely gorgeous
there's so many unique pieces and there
are so many different partners and I
love going to breakfast is like this
because you get to meet so many people I
even got to meet the founder and
obviously you get to try on and sample
collections I love this piece and they
ended up taking quite a few pieces that
I ended up wearing the majority of the
week
so I ended up finding this gorgeous
little cafe called the farm girl it is
in Notting Hill
what I found out it was actually
relatively new and I was actually just
looking for shoot locations and this
place is gorgeous there's even a little
cafe dog who's super cute and I ended up
wearing my denim jacket which I did get
from the Bella yellow collection along
with this lace dress if I am wearing
something girly like this dress I like
to pair with something a little bit
harder which is why this denim jacket
was perfect it's always nice to find
like a little area in the city where you
can basically sit down and get some work
I found these charged grams which is
basically open for anyone and I
basically like to bring my laptop book
out and get a little bit of work done I
have this gorgeous jumper which I picked
up early on in the week this book that
I'm reading and I just know chill out so
my battery dies or till it gets cold and
I love wearing a jumper I've like shorts
because sometimes you don't want exposed
to too much if you're ever looking for
something interesting to do the
Southbank is always great there's so
much artwork that the skate park and
there's lots of places to eat I really
like Oaxaca which is basically a Mexican
place and it's just quick and easy but
it tastes really really good as you can
see I got a whole bunch of tacos and
everything and it's super lovely
probably look I basically wore this like
silky shirt and never shorts faux
leather shorts which I really like to
wear basically because it is so hot at
the moment even though it's kind of
breezy and Mike's just helping me adjust
right there
so if you don't know I'm definitely a
public transport type of girl I love
being on the Underground and on the
train and I'm basically on the district
line down to warden I love reading my
metro obviously when I'm on the train
and Wimbledon the tennis matches on if
you guys didn't know and what I like is
that you can go into and we're done and
your chairs and their screens can
basically get involved even if you don't
have to get and then wearing this
gorgeous oversized tee from criminal
damage which I thought was super cool
for a perfect day like this so guys that
is a weekend where's a London edition I
hope you liked the little know adding of
what I was doing and hopefully it gives
you guys some ideas of things to do over
the weekend so thanks so much guys and
I'll see you on Saturday bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
