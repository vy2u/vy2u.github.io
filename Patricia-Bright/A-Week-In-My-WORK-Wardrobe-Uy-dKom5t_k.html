that has been highly highly requested
which is my work kind of outfits of the
day and you're impossible well you're
not in for surprise well like it's very
different to what you guys see me like
on YouTube so you guys can get a look
into and to just me as a corporate
worker and also I actually hate my hair
now I'm just bored of it I want
extensions just because the way that the
dress is just making me look so old I
look old my head is not really helping
me really my head is quite fat my hair
too short and I'm just tired of it
basically so let's get started and see
my well I'm going to try and do a week
in my wardrobe but it might be just
three days but let's see see you guys
later bye okay so here is a day number
one and I feel really good because you
guys have never seen me like this and
basically I'm wearing a like suit but
these pieces I bought separately this
jacket is from Zara I bought it ages ago
for 20 quid in the sale and then the
skirt is from Dorothy Perkins what they
seem to have the same pattern and I'm
just wearing kind of a shifty shirt
which is from shifty shifty best kind of
go top which is like that which is from
Primark and I'm wearing your tights and
I wear these standard court shoes daily
because they're comfortable I can read
them in the office so the only way I can
trend it up a little bit is by wearing
just a nice jacket over it and this is a
trench coat from Banana Republic and so
that makes it look a little bit more
trendy with my fur trim she like Oh
trendy but wait but wait I have to wear
a backpack now it's not that I have to
but I have a laptop which and my work
laptop which is in my back and with
consulting you go to what we call client
side so you have to take that foot with
you and really this is the best thing
that I can wear or economically so that
is my shame and I felt like a school kid
because it's like
going to school from my backpack so um
yeah obviously if I don't need my
backpack that I would you know carry a
hamper or something like that
let's call it go web Banana Republic and
blur breeze buy a jacket no anyway I'll
see you guys tomorrow bye okay guys so
it's day two and I decided to dress a
bit more fun a bit more casual and kind
of realized up the environment what's
not more casual but I can have a bit of
style with it so I have a dress on today
and yes I'll just show you and talk a
bit about it I'm wearing my cos watch as
well I've got a dress on of which I
already said with long sleek shoulders I
think that dresses are long sleeve
shoulders are the most appropriate type
of dresses you can have um for work and
it's this sort dress with the pleats and
I'm going to be wearing it with the
black blazer just to keep it as
corporate as I possibly can so I'll show
you it from the back from from the back
further back
so it is Wednesday today and I for
quickly go through my outfit again
obviously I'm showing your week in my
work wardrobe so I'm just wearing this
shirt which is kind of a reverse shirt
with the black and the white it's got
this really cool detailing around the
edges and this is from a new look I
think I believe it's from new look and
I'm wearing it buttoned up to the top
but that's just to be trendy probably
hard you know take down one or two
buttons and put on my jacket I'm wearing
these um maroon trousers which my sister
bought for me I really really like them
you guys have seen them before they've
got a touch of black on this side and
the touchid black on the back there so
uh-oh I've let me talk through my
jewelry as well cuz I didn't mention it
in a week I do keep my jewelry to a
minimum I just literally wear these
pearls all week and my hair I actually
had like a fake bun on the end but I got
tired of it and I took off on the train
on the way home yeah so anyway I just
shoot from that bye guys
okay so here is um wednesday's outfit I
probably would have been saying the days
I don't think but Wednesday's outfit in
whole and I absolutely love these
trousers because they're high on the
waist and they make my bum look really
good and their ankle grazers so you get
to sit on you and wish you could see but
you get to see quite a bit of ankle and
foot ankle foot you know I got a little
foot thing so I look really cool really
smart
again I put on my blazer with this so
that's this outfit and you don't have to
do it button what I don't have to do it
buttoned all the way up to the top like
this if I don't want to look too like
cool and that's it and again with the
trusty backpack I will see you guys

feeling a bit boring today and Oh boobie

this with a pair of pinstripe work
trousers really just nothing I'm special
