if you guys don't know I am partnered
with diet coke as part of the diet coke
break series and they have a competition
that I wanted to tell you guys about
because it is definitely something that
I think would be quite fabulous if one
of my subscribers or anyone watching
this video was actually to win it so
basically direct coke are giving away
five thousand pounds every single day
from the eleven for September and
basically what people need to do you
have to pick up one of these tins in
store it says win a five thousand pounds
every single day and then there was a
code on it where you guys can actually
enter that in and be in with the chance
to win that five thousand pounds so I
quickly want to share what I would do to
have a perfect weekend
if I had five thousand pounds and to be
completely honest with you I am very
very blessed and if I had five thousand
pounds I would want to spend it on
someone else or with someone else you
know what I'm saying it and so I thought
it would be nice to me just to break
down how it's been five thousand pounds
with me and my girlfriends for a perfect
weekend so number one is a Pampas full
weekend a lot of my friends are moms a
lot of my friends are busy and I know
that taking the girls away on a little
bit of a spa weekend with our ropes on
with our hair tied up with a face mask
on we would be living our best lives and
you know if I want some money or be
amazing if I was able to take them out
to do something special with them so
another thing I would do if I had the
perfect weekend and five thousand pounds
to spend with my friends if I would
definitely invest in their ideas I don't
know if you have friends or dreams and
visions and ideas those friends that you
really really love I love the idea of
being able to part with some of my money
part ways especially if I had won some
money to give it to work to them to just
basically contribute to something that
they are thinking of doing for
themselves because it means that you get
to be part of the whole entire process
and really be a good friend and of
course this is a good one have ensuring
experience I went away with my
girlfriends to one
recently and - I went to Rome and that
was one of my first trips away I had it
when I was 18 and honestly there was
nothing quite like having an experience
where your girlfriends and if you did
have the money going on an epic girls
trip away is something I think everybody
should do finally I think a really good
way to spend a weekend in 5,000 pounds
is to do something charitable with you
or your friends if there is any way that
you guys can get together and be part of
either community project or somewhere
that needs some help and you have some
money to contribute towards it it's an
amazing thing I used to be part of a
homeless one and I feel like I need to
get back to it and you know during the
Christmas time and during the winter
time we would go and hand out food and
toiletries and just have a gym work with
people who were out on the streets in
London and you go as we would go as part
of an organization and it's something
that one really did bond us and we were
able to do something with any positive
for the community and positive for our
city and it was just a great way to be
charitable as well and you know if I had
a little extra money in my back pocket
there doing something like that I think
that that is a great way to spend a
weekend to be completely honest with
your girlfriends with a little bit of
money and potentially getting together
and helping some other people so guys
various other ways that I would spend 5k
for a perfect weekend and make sure we
check out the diet coke Facebook page
where there was a video with Holly
Willoughby sharing how she would spend a
perfect weekend okay guys thank you so

Facebook link in the description bar
