have another chatty video for you and
we're talking about adult live versus
teenage life and i know you guys really
do enjoy my chatty videos like this and
I really appreciate the lovely comments
that I get and how many of us all relate
to being the ugly friend and dealing
with disappointment and all these kind
of stuff that I've talked about in the
past so today I wanted to talk about
adult versus teenage life just because
it's something that the older I get the
more I think about the things that I
thought were really important when I was
a teenager and how they actually don't
matter so much now and also I'm working
with a charity called Childline I'm sure
a lot of you know who Childline is they
have a campaign called F a PZ fats which
is basically all about how porn affects
young people and their relationships
they noticed that there was an increase
in the number of cause and the number of
young people who were being impacted and
affected by porn it may be a way that
wasn't the most ideal clearly I'm going
to link it all in the description bar
below I am actually voicing over one of
the characters in one of the episodes so
do check it out and have a look at that
but it really made me feel like talking
about adult life versus teenage life
because when I was a teenager Paul was
not really a big thing and there were a
couple of things unlike people's phones
and stuff and it wasn't like a major
major thing as it might be today but it
inspired me to talk about adult life
versus teenage life so get comfortable
and get a cup of tea when you are an
adult things like trendiness or having
the latest things really don't matter
anymore if anything being unique and
having your own sense of style is really
celebrated now when I was growing up I
sadly did not have any designer things
like no no ain't no one buy you designer
Patricia they sit down there
I even had really big feet as a child
you guys know about my big feet issues
and I could wear my mom's shoes but mom
hasn't got
- shoe so she had grandma's shoes and I
was wearing grandma's shoes right and I
remember feeling so embarrassed by how
untrained II my shoes were I never had
like the Nikes the Reebok my mom she
tried she bought me a pair of Mercury's
if you know what Mercury's are they are
the like Clark's train it's all
something along the lines they were so
so bad and I remember that I was just so
embarrassed about them
that after wearing them for like six
months and being tormented about my
trainers I remember that I basically one
day got like a knife or like scissors or
something i slashed them up I found some
mud like slathered my shoes in mud and I
came home like mom I really need new
trainers and then she bought me some
ends and ends were a step up from
mercury but clearly they were not the
one but I remember like how embarrassed
I felt by not having trendy things and
now that my older like I could not care
you see the Primark holes I'll wear
whatever I feel comfortable and yes I
like nice things and I like designers as
well because I can afford them now but
please whatever trending this is not a
thing that matters so much when you're
an adult which is a really really cool
so if you're worried about that kind of
fitting in and being trendy right now
don't worry you'll pass number two fake
friendships I feel like when you were a
teenager you had to be friend of Lucy
Mary John that you had to be referring
to people but you didn't really like
there but you didn't want to be left out
you just deep down know that you don't
necessarily connect in that way and you
probably don't even like them and you've
heard they've talked about you but
you're still smiling each other's
travellers faces and you know all this
kind of stuff where you have all these
kind of tense friendships let me tell
you when you're an adult no one's got
time for fake friendships trust me the
people who are your life are probably
the people who are there to stay the
older you get the more busy you get and
actually the people who stick around are
the people who really really love you
and really really care and there's
something so invigorating knowing that
the team that you have around you is
your ride or die when you aren't adult
you
have to deal with an ever-changing body
I know some of you guys may have acne
you might have puppy fat you might be
really skinny like I was I was literally
a bag of bones growing up and I hated
how I was skinny I was
I would eat McDonald's every day and it
was literally my my the thing I was most
self-conscious about when I was young
which was literally being called like
lollipop head and just being so skinny
and then when I hit like 18 19 all of a
sudden I just developed a couple of cars
and a little bit of things that really
made me look a lot sexier ish too makes
them but by the time were an adult you
kind of reach a plateau in your body now
the question is whether or not you like
it or not but I know how hard it is to
deal with a body shape that is always
changing skin that is always doing
random crazy things don't worry guys
your body will settle down at some point
in time and you won't have to fathom
changing your jeans every month or two
the next thing is a lack of confidence
now there's something about being a
teenager or being young that means that
you're probably not that confident and
the thing is I know some of you guys may
suffer from slight anxiety right now or
a lack of confidence or not feeling able
to speak up trust me I feel like a lot
of young people go through that and
being able to speak up for yourself
comes with experience the old you you
get the more opportunities and chances
you get to talk up where you have to
take control and you have to be
confident if you are serving people at a
counter you can't sit there mumbling and
being uncomfortable you are going to
have to speak up
and a lot of the times when you're a
teenager you're being spoken to by
people by your teachers you're being
spoken to by your parents there's always
someone bossing you around but when
you're an adult you can do what you want
and that really does help you develop a
more self-confidence so on the lines of
confidence it's much easier as an adult
to speak to someone of the opposite set
yes I'm telling you I used to be someone
who know well I've been okay
talking to guys if it's a guy that I
fancy oh my gosh no the level of awkward
I become is literally a hundred and ten
however I know some of you guys get so
nervous and I'm going to do a video all
about boys and relationships and stuff
that it's coming up but trust me the
odds you get the Egypt becomes to speak
to the opposite sex because they end up
being part of your social group you
might end up being a girl who only ever
has all these girlfriends especially for
me I went to a girls school so I didn't
really have that many boyfriends or
Boyett boyfriends at or boyfriends until
I was like 19 okay and so don't worry
about that I know lots of you guys worry
about being young and never having a
boyfriend it doesn't matter but the
thing is the older you get you end up
having more encounters with guys and you
realize they're a little bit smelly but
actually they're not that bad in the
kinda just like girls but they create a
little bit less and they're not as
fabulous as females are actually no
there's some guys out there who are
fabulous as well so I can't even say
that so when you're an adult you don't
have to ask permission for nothing
now if you are rebel I've always been a
rebellious person so I like to do stuff
that wasn't really meant to do and but
when you're an adult you can do whatever
the hell you want to do right
nobody in this you didn't need to ask me
no questions you just do what you want
to do and it's something that's so very
freeing about being like you know what I
can take control of my life I can do
what I want when you're teenager it's a
little bit harder to do that but why the
time you're like 22 like probably like
21 okay you're considered legally an
adult and you get to make your own
choices and your own decisions and I
only hope and you hope that you make the
right decisions based on the community
you have around you and examples that
you have around you finally when you're
an adult you become less scared over
trying new things and for me this is
like the most important thing I have
become someone who has literally pushed
myself and done so many things that I
don't like the older that I've got and
that might be from traveling
you and abseiling and I hate physical
activity people but I've done things all
over the world that I would never have
thought as a teenager I would ever be
able to do as a teenager you actually
can't fathom how much you'll be able to
do in life but you are able to do so
much you get to experience so much the
older you get and I can only encourage
those of you who are teenagers to be
patient right literally the best is yet
to come
if you ever feel like you're maybe a
little bit stressed right now on teenage
life trust me you're gonna be an adult
soon okay things get a lot better and
you know the world is a massive and
amazing and beautiful place so guys I
hope you enjoyed that video and it gave
you a little bit of insight into me I'm
very happy about just getting older and
mature and I want you guys to just join
me on that journey and I thought I have
so many young people watching and I want
to encourage you that you know you can
get to where I myself am and further and
better and stuff like that I hope that
gives you some inspiration as mentioned
and I am working with Childline on the
fats project so make sure you check it
out it's all linked in the description
bar below but thank you so much for
watching and I'll catch you guys later
bye so guys today we are going to slow
it down and I'm going to share the my
relaxing evening routine and lots of you
have asked about this so I hope you
enjoy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
