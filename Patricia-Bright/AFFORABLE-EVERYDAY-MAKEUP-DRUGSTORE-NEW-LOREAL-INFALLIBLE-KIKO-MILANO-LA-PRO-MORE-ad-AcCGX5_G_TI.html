have this look for your hair this is
basically been my go-to look on a
regular basis because I don't have time
to always switch up my look or do
anything to my face and it is affordable
because I know you guys have been asking
me to do more looks that are affordable
so yeah I absolutely love this look and
I feel like with my brown hair I kind of
have to be a bit more careful with what
kind of looks I do but this one is swap
on in my opinion like look at me just
right in myself you know but you know
what you know you've got to write
yourself just in case no enough for it
you know I will write myself right now
so if you want to see how I actually got
this look just keep watching and you
cannot subscribe please subscribe I love
you and you can follow me on my social
media and all that jazz hey guys let's
get into this video okay so here I am I
am a very shiny right now because I put
my moisturizer on I'm going to go ahead
and put on a Primark and now at the
moment my eyebrows need some work
because they haven't been cemented in a
while but since I'm trying to grow them
out a bit I am using the Loreal brow
artist shape up and the color I'm using
is brunette what I like about this color
is that it's not dark DUP it's quite a
warm brown and I've been making quite a
warm brown look on my eyebrows so next
these are affordable these are from
superdrug these are the pro artist long
where I think neck concealers and the
color I'm using is called form this
brush is from backstage Beauty I'm
telling you that this is the best
eyebrow concealer brush ever no joke
this brush is just oh my gosh it's just
amazing even if you have rough eyebrows
a little bit of concealer you know it
just hides a multitude of things
now I'm going to go in and continue
using the pro artist and concealer
actually like the color for like a
bright concealer and it's very similar
to the LA gun as well but sometimes I
find the LA girl a little bit drying so
next up I am using at the L'Oreal Paris
infallible total cover and so many
you guys have told me that you've seen
the ad hey I also posted up my Instagram
page and obviously a malaria ambassador
so amazing to be part of the teen and
amazing team it's an amazing brand and
yeah I basically got to try the new
foundation and I have been using it for
my everyday routine because I prize it's
just very easy to use obviously it has a
weightless feel even though it's quite
full coverage as you mean who has kind
of uneven skin tone if you have kind of
dark areas down here lighter areas up
here it kind of gives me a bit more than
one tone effect but without feeling
heavy and it lasts all day so I really
like that what I found though while I'm
applying it I like to use something that
has a flat head I feel that it just
applies a bit better like that it really
does help to even out my uneven areas so
the finish is ultra ultra matte which
for me I'm an oily girl so Lord Ezra I
need this and I know a lot of people
were messaging me that they weren't able
to find the color on the launch day
hopefully you should be able to find
those now I actually did speak to the
team a list of a message and they said
that they will be dealing with that so
the great thing about being an
ambassador is that I get to you know
speak to the guys voice concerns and
just and voice questions that you guys
have and press stuff out it's an amazing
opportunity especially when the products
really good as well so they have it a
matte full coverage that's I'm just
going to blend out my brows a little bit
more and just conceal down my nose
another affordable favorite is the LA
girl Pro concealer and I'm going to use
this to contour the color is dark cocoa
and they've got two really dark shades
that I really do quite like I find that
this one is just a little bit warmer but
don't know if fashiona is counted as
affordable but to me it's like what I
use every day
so I'm just going to set my eyes here
I'm kind of failing in that affordable
department here but this is my favorite
current I look I basically just put a
wash of orange on my eye and yeah this
is like my favorite orange to go to I
find that orange is just a really
flattering color I just like to use a
fluffy brush and just put it all over
basically and isn't going to be extra I
add a little bit of this high pigment
from Pico just on the middle of my lid
in law I also have have these I paint
this is a color called breathtaking
Brown which I really like because if I
can liquid it very creamy so you can be
quite precise when you apply it but then
it dries really mad so I haven't been
wearing eyeliner I feel like it makes me
look slightly more useful and I'm using
just a mascara I love this mascara this
is the false lashes to start egg fiber
it's got two different sides and I
really feel like this definitely makes
my eyelashes look so much fuller and
thicker and fluffier and it will
probably because it has a fiber effect
as well just going to get all this
powder off and I've been using me and
ebro's brushes you've got a new set of
rushes which I really really like so I
actually look varying that right now as
you can see it's got a full coverage
look so I'm going to add a bit of
highlight and a bit of jus to myself you
know what I'm actually just going to go
ahead and use that pea coat to highlight
because why not right so I'm just going
to add some blush I'm going to use the
lawyer infallible brush paints and I'm
going to use the peach fling in the
middle and this palette smells so good
it's unbelievable how small cute
I'm just going to line my lips with a
brown liner and then I'm going to go in
with the lip paint lacquers also from
L'Oreal
and then just with some extra gloss I'm
going to go in with the key comb and I
know these are the Hydra lip glosses
which Paul has made everything popped a
little more funny enough I haven't even
put on eyelashes like Wow okay guys so
somehow my camera stopped working but
this is my finished look affordable
quick and you need to do for every day
so I hope you enjoyed and I'll catch you
soon bye hi guys welcome to my channel
today's video we're going to get a
little bit up close and personal and I
wanted to talk about contraception</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
