Thursday I'm so sorry that I did not
upload on Sunday I feel like I've been a
naughty not a naughty girl and I don't
know about it some people are like
telling me off for like not being
consistent and usually like I've not
missed a Sunday uploading like a year or
something but people are getting a
little bit you know annoying at me I'm
really sorry my older sister is visiting
and she has her six-month-old baby I'm
sure lots of you guys might have seen in
my snapchat and I have a choice over
edit or to spend time with baby and my
top tip for baby ok guys I'm sorry I'm
broody and yeah I haven't seen my sister
in so long and haven't seen the baby
since he was 10 days old so for me like
family is so important and I'm very
sorry about I knew I was gonna do this
video today anyway but I basically just
wanted to share some of my absolute
favorite things of the moment I don't do
monthly favorites cuz I just genuinely
don't have new favorite products every
single month but I just got favorite
things that I feel like I want to share
for this season and hopefully it gives
you some inspiration and there's also
useful you know I want everything I do
to be relatively useful and I always
want you to get a pen and paper and for
that yes I can apply this to my life or
whatever so let's get started I'm going
to start off with my beauty things and
then just some random things I'm sorry I
feel like my favorite things aren't as
glamorous as they are meant to be but
they are practical okay
practical / glamorous but let's do the
glamorous things so number one it's
gonna be this Illamasqua lipstick you
guys have been complimenting me on it so
many times and you see me wearing it and
wearing it now with a combination of
very Victoria as well and it's from a
new collection I have no idea what the
lipstick is called because it's on the
packaging but it's a beautiful beautiful
dark red and it kind of feels like a
mature edge you know like I'm a grown
woman kind of right I really like it for
the autumn season and I just wear it
with very Victoria from Charlotte over
on the inside because I feel like my
lips do need some extra dimension but
it's a gorgeous kind of
that in lipstick and after that it's an
oldie but anui it is the ardell lashes
and I've got two things to say about the
eyelashes the reason why I've come back
to liking this it's a guy that should be
wearing like the mink like they're not
really me but the mink lashes and velour
lashes and they are beautiful like they
look gorgeous they can be really
fluttery eyes but you know what they're
not as easy as just a pair of our Dells
one they're quite expensive they are
beautiful if you have a special occasion
I would definitely suggest buying them I
have a coupon code down below but I just
prefer the cheapy lashes which you can
just fling on and not worry if you lose
them and these actually last just as
long as the mink ones actually find that
the mink ones are lost less because when
you try to peel off the like glue and
the bad this stuff the lashes actually
come off that doesn't happen on these
are doll lashes also just a little trick
boot sells out our lashes for five pound
fifty nine or five pounds ninety-nine no
I go to my local Asian store beauty
supply store and I buy them for two
pound 29 now I don't really get to go to
them often so I usually just stock up on
like ten for my bag and go so I'm not
about to be paying double the price for
our lashes that I've been buying for the
last five years for two pounds
ninety-nine and actually they used to
need one pallet 99 but yeah they're a
really really good pair of lashes after
that it's going to be the Tom Ford know
our dinner perfume and I really do love
the Tom Ford
perfumes there's something about the
Norden raw that is so sexy like it jet
like the bottle is sexy and the smell is
sexy and I think I'm liking things are a
little bit more grown woman and this
just has that that like you know what
get ready tonight baby you kind of smell
to it
it's really rich it's really like dark
and really warm and it's so hard to
explain perfume smells but this one is
like female female warmers
I didn't ever want me to say that but I
feel like it smells real sexy and if you
want a smell sexy you should go for this
and after that I wanted to show you my
simple skin care white and these are
actually designed that are in
collaboration with Holly full term and
you guys know simple that everything
they do is usually really clear really
crisp and their packaging is usually
just green and white but they've gotten
for the black and white packaging and
also the pink pack packages but one
thing I realize is that I haven't had
wipes for a really long time but I
realize how essential they are if you
have events or if you're on the fly you
got a long day you're not gonna want
your makeup off just having wipes or
actually just save you especially if
they're really gentle and these ones are
actually really really good really
really gentle if you have sensitive skin
and they get so much off I love it
after that it is my Revlon a precision
duct lash adhesive now everyone uses
that I'll or adhesive and some other
adhesive accompany when it's cold and I
used to buy that but where I am I can't
really get it to it easily and then
somehow I was in Tesco and I was like I
desperately need eyelash glue and then
they only had this and I'm telling you
this is one of the best eyelash glue I
have ever used my eyelashes stayed down
and this is actually the black glue the
black adhesive as well but my eyelashes
stayed down they look great you don't
get that white crispy shiny eye Livi
thing and I know it's so so good and
it's lasted me so long without drying
out and it's just got the standard brush
applicator like this am I looking a
little bit wild right now and if you
guys can see it's a little bit wild and
I can't quite get the lid down because
it's got a little bit too much glue on
the outside but honestly amazing where
have I been
do these final bits aren't necessarily
beauty but they're like skinny and hairy
thing so I'll show them to you anyway
so I mentioned in the past that I
basically suffer from like contact
dermatitis or eczema or whatever
underneath my eyes and just around my
eyes in general because I do have
allergies I have dust allergies and like
a fever and stuff and I get my my eyes
really really rich and then they go
really rink
you get really swollen and they just
look like some grandma eyes like if you
come really close up and I even had to
go to the doctor and I've been dealing
with this for over a year and so they
gave prescribing a steroid cream like
0.01 percent hydrocortisone steroid
cream but it's really bad to use steroid
creams especially consistently because
it thins the skin and especially around
the eyes because I either so thin and so
and I skins are so thin and I use the
steroid cream for about for like the
seven days and it cleared it up but I
realized that I just kept getting this
reoccurring me and I didn't want to keep
having to like put steroid cream in my
eye steroid cream on my eye and then
have literally no eye skin left or just
be have wrinkly eyes so I was like I
need an alternative and then somehow I
came across this boots um think it's the
derma care ammonia cream with almond oil
and lemon and I have genuinely found
this has made a significant difference
one in the texture of my skin and to
like the itchiness and the dryness I'm
not getting it so much and to my skin my
eye skin doesn't look so wrinkly it was
going really wrinkly and just dry and
flaky and it just looked awful but this
has really really helped and then after
that this sub product is old school just
let's just stop no I don't know how many
of you guys have watch coming to America
this product here is called ESCO and
this is a curl activator for people who
have a jheri curl if you don't know what
a jheri curl is a jheri curl is
basically where people put like pearls
into their hair and loose curls into
their natural hair texture and it always
looks kind of wet like wet look I think
in the 90s people used to have it a lot
this kind of Jerry called hair texture
and you had to have bottles and bottles
of ESCO or color activator to keep those
cars moisturized advise your hair with a
crisp and just dry off hilarious I
actually had cousins it had an ESCO
never had one I really wanted one though
and but if you guys don't know this
product is a real amazing product I am
trying to
just look after my hair under my
extensions a lot more
I am fully natural now because my edges
were just kind of crying Bloody Mary and
I just used this to moisturize my hair
every other day underneath my hair
extensions but eschar is super cool it's
so retro okay it's $2.99 it's a cheap
product but I just noticed that Urban
Outfitters just sell it started selling
mane and tail again for the old school
you know black kids among us main Attell
was like the product that your
great-aunt your grandma used to use or
someone used to use in blow aren't you
are you using a horse product and now
they're selling that in urban office
okay I can tell you real soon that ESCO
will be on the shelves because this
stuff is so moisturizing it's basically
water glycerin and some other stuff in
it but it does keep your hair any
moisturizer okay so like non-beauty
favorite are number one it's got two and
I feel like I've mentioned these before
but they've come back into my life and
it's basically my mill tabs from the 21
day fix that the 21 day fix is basically
a DVD 60-day no 21 days of working out
and eating to get you really really trim
and really really lean and I did here
after I basically bought it after being
in America for like a weekend and I
watched the American TV and those ads
and they make you want to buy everything
they make you want to buy everything I'm
an advertiser's drink I buy everything
but this looks so good I like genuinely
believed it I was like yeah I need to do
the 21 day fix and it's really it's
really good it's actually amazing the
workouts are really intense and really
good you can do them in half an hour and
then I found that just having these
really made me think about my portions
and the way I put food together I'm not
necessarily on a diet or something I'm
just trying to eat better and eat the
right amount of portions for my body and
just to be more thoughtful when I eat
and they also have like a meal plan book
and all that kind of good stuff
but basically you put different food
groups
into your tubs and then you
for each meal you eat a different kind
of combination of your of the food group
so this is safe fruit I'm in our three
portions of food a day so I like just
taking the thought out of but what
should I eat how should I eat it I'm
putting it this way and I feel like once
I started doing this I get a lot of
bloating so my stomach gets really big
as lots of people seem to notice and I
get quite bloated I have like heartburn
like really bad heartburn and stuff they
I've always had my gastric problems and
I realized that when I overeat it just
causes me more issues and for those of
you guys who watch my vlogs and know me
I love my food like I love my food but
the relationship has to change
that's change and I've been working on
changing that relationship in a way
that's positive you know it's got this
random just one piece of hair that is
just straight like what is that doing oh
it's that piece from there after that
I've got some joy pieces to show you
number one it's my Larson and Jenning
swatch it is I believe it is a swiss
made what and I don't know if you guys
have seen these around they're very
trendy but they're just an excellent
piece of just watch hurry is it called
watcher I don't know what you call it
crockery I don't I'm making it up it's
just the most gorgeous watch ever it's
in the rose gold and I saw this watch
over a year ago a friend of mine had it
in the gold and I was like it was
amazing I went into Liberty's I was like
looking at the watches and just what
they were absolutely perfect and it's
just such an amazing classic timepiece
that you can wear with everything after
that it's also this little bracelet with
kind of like an evil eye on it as well
which is des classic blue and white
design but it's done with stones and I
picked this up while in the market in
Istanbul my mum and I went on a really
cool trip with Harrods to Istanbul and I
just was you know in the market and you
know you can end up buying so many
things I ended up buying like a thousand
teas lychee pomegranate tea apple tea
winter tea
picked up so many teens it was
ridiculous and then I picked up this
gorgeous gorgeous bracelet which is kind
of rose gold plated and then it also has
the kind of string straps there as well
and I love like layering the watch and
the bracelet together after that I have
to share a book with you and it is my
Arianna Huffington her book called
thrive came out in like 2014 it might
have been a little bit older than that
and I I had in my collection but I
hadn't really read it through and I have
been reading it and for anyone who knows
me I don't really read the fiction I
don't really read for entertainment I
read for like to develop myself I love
self-help books and anything that's
going to inspire me to like be better
and this book is all about rest and
finding alternative ways to be happy if
you don't know who this lady is she is
the founder of The Huffington Post she
was a best-selling you know a
best-selling author at the age of 23 and
is very very successful and she
basically had awful burnout where she
was ended up in hospital and it made her
really eight her life to really look at
what was important to her and that
finding that the additional pillars of
of of happiness aren't just power and
money and all these things and that
there's other areas that we all need to
develop and I think it's just a really
good book and it's something that I
always want to remember and I tried to
be like yes I'm all about you know
growing myself and working hard but also
my family's so important to me my health
is so important to me you know
experience in nature and helping and
adding to people's life outside of what
I do is always really important to me so
I just feel like this is a really good
reminder and if you're battling with
just balancing your life I think that
could be useful finally I have my night
key these are my free what these called
my Nike Free 5.0 s
these are running trainers and if you
don't know I also work a lot with Nike
now I know each different type of
trainer and how they work so you have
running your training of style and these
are an excellent pair of running
trainers they're so comfortable and I'm
not
the Pro Runner or anything like this I
do run a lot more than I used to but I
just realized that when you have the
right equipment it makes so much
difference these are the most
comfortable pair of trainers you will
ever ever have they are so amazing and
they look great as why I can wear them
with jeans or jogging bottoms and just
go about my business and I've become
someone who's really quite casual in the
day probably shouldn't be but I am
miss casual okay guys that is it for me
I know it's not monthly favorites but
I'm just sharing some of my favorite
things with you at the moment do let me
know what you want to see next and I
just wanted to have a little caveat
about some things that happen recently I
want to apologize number one I've been a
little bit of snappy with people you
know we've all got there we all have
hormones and stuff or my like social
media like especially on Instagram
because people do say things sometimes
that can then be a little bit
insensitive and I kind of had a barrage
of comments that were like quite
negative about me and I kind of said
something that wasn't the nicest I mean
I said I'd rather if people would just
keep silent
rather than say anything and then said
that not everybody has home training and
also that my dad says common sense is
not common it's not the nicest thing I
could have said but I was out of her eye
her I deleted the post but I think that
we're in a day and age or people
sometimes think that people like myself
aren't necessarily human but we are and
these parallel feelings okay
but I appreciate each and every one of
you and I do take on the words that you
say and I want to do I want to do right
by me but also do right by you anyway
that's it I will see you guys on Sunday
let me know what you want to see cuz I
might got anything ready yet I might do
this like look or get ready with me or
something like that but I don't know I
think I might do something chatty but I
don't know what to talk about anyway
I've been on here far too long so I'll
catch you guys later thanks for watching
guys bye today I'm gonna do my makeup
collection tall my closet room tour and
maybe give you a quick
peek at my shoe collection as well and
if you guys have been watching me long
enough you know that I basically go
through these phases I've just wanted to
clear everything out and getting quite
like changing things in like that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
