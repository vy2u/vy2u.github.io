have a whole video and I'm quite excited
about this haul because it's probably
been about two and a half to three
months since I last Donahoe I know it's
been that long and in my last you guys
were using a comments and people were
like oh we want to see a haul and as
like it's coming girls it is coming and
yes I know my hair has changed again
what do you guys think I definitely feel
like mid limp hair is now my thing like
I don't think I'm gonna go really
ridiculously long anymore or short
I feel like this length here is like my
ideal length and I must say that I've
got the most amazing cut my hairdresser
Marie is a godsend she makes me the most
amazing units and new parts and weaves
and everything Jesus does everything
needs you so good and obviously I do
have a hair extension line which is
coming out at the end of November I
cannot wait to finally share all of you
but that's not what this video is about
and it's about to be a nice cool time
and again I think I just said I'm super
excited about this whole books I love
absolutely everything I've got here so
get a cup of tea a smoothie a glass of
wine or water depending on your own your
age I'd love to know what all your
different ages are actually and enjoy
this haul so the first thing I want to
show you is this crop top that I am
wearing it is a white lace top from
misguided and nowadays I love tops that
have got a little bit more detail on it
but because I now have a bigger bust I
find that I can't wear tops that are too
high without looking quite frumpy but I
find that if it's got like a mesh or
lace
it looks really and again I mean without
showing all the like boobies and
everything like that so you guys might
have noticed a trend oh me wearing like
mesh on the top or maybe showing a
little bit more because I find it a
little bit more flattering but I love
the color and I love the lace and you
know I do love misguided it does have
some great bits that are really trendy
after that I picked up this I let do
tell top which is cool Jesus again I
love detail around my chest area and I
think it's super cute and it's kind of
like a lace-up one but it's not lace-up
and all the girls are misguided have
basically flat chests so when they have
the the V it goes down really low and it
looks really good on there but if you've
got like big boobs or saggy boobs or I
don't know something like that it's just
a little bit much so I'm probably going
to get a lace from like Michael's
trainers or something and I'm going to
lace it up so it's not so low on me
after that it's going to be hard to see
so hopefully I'll wear it for you I
picked up this v-neck black dress which
has got some details on it it's kind of
got the the flappy details which i think
is super nice I find all black to be
really flattering and I'm actually off
to Dubai on Thursday for my friend's
birthday so I wanted like a little black
sexy cocktail dress that I can wear and
I think this is going to look so nice if
you like red lips and like this bob
finally from misguided I just picked up
this tan skirt I do love tube skirts and
I just haven't had a lot or I haven't
refreshed them for a really long time so
I bought this one in the tan it's the
midi skirt and I love wearing it like
oversized jumpers or like a loose tops
rather than like a hole fitted look and
just because it's getting colder but I'm
still girly girl and I finally if I were
to talk with a jumper looks super cute
so moving on to my favorite azor azor
have done me well I don't know how long
you guys have been watching me if you're
new here hey if you're old here we love
you there's a leather jacket that I've
had for basically four years and it
comes out every single year because I've
not been able to find an alternative
leather jacket of Dreams until today
this jacket here is the most gorgeous by
car leather jacket it is a real leather
jacket such a night into whenever I'm
sure there's lots of foam alternatives
whereas this one's a proper biker jacket
with collars and absolutely everything
the detail on it is amazing and it's so
flattering this is 90
nine pounds as well 100 pounds but I
think that's a bargain for a really good
classic leather jacket I then picked up
this gorgeous baby pink polo neck is
kind of itchy though it's in that itchy
material that I hated as a kid but as an
adult I'm willing to wear it because it
looks good but it's just this kind of
hope you guys can see because it's a bit
bright but it's just this gorgeous
pinky girly color it's so soft and I
would wear this with like leather
leather leggings or leather trousers and
some boots and just be done with it
because it's so like bubblegum pink it's
kind of like oh how do I look wearing
this but I think it's just such a cute
item sticking with the jumpers fiend
I bought quite a few jumpers because we
are going to the winter time and I just
like the way jumpers look and everything
and then I picked up this one oh yes you
can see the detail on it it is what they
call this pattern I can't remember what
they call this Cup cable-knit cave on it
and it came with jogging bottoms but it
kind of looked like I was wearing
pajamas so the certain I can't wear all
of this together I look like some kind
of fluffy crowd thing like no just not
going to do that but uh yeah but on its
own with you know black leather trousers
or skinny jeans I knew that this was
going to be absolutely perfect it's such
a nice jumper and I love jumpers that
have a split down the side as well
really flattering especially if you have
Vivat um or um if you carry your weight
around the middle of your boxy shape
then it's a really really good way to be
really flattering so I love that now if
you've been on my snapchat my snapchat
is Patricia bright X I couldn't remember
what my sub-tree is Patricia bright X
I've worn this on my snapchat quite a
few times and basically it is a long
maxi dress in this kind of grey mottled
details and it's got these gorgeous rose
gold buttons on the arms I hope you can
see that and then it's got a split just
down the side why I love this is because
it's like the most carved the bull dress
ever put it almost on trainers awesome
heel if you want to be sexy but it looks
so good it's quite low does give me a
lot of cleavage but I
really do like the comfort of just
throwing on a cozy dress so nice I also
went for two more midi skirts which are
in the tube style I went for a mustard
one because I really like just bright
colors with something plain and then I
went with a black one as well these are
just over the knee I love a tube skirt
and I just realize that my closet needed
an update when it came to these so it's
party season and I knew I was going away
but I like to keep my style quite simple
they had these really nice body con
midi-length
dresses they're super affordable it just
looked really nice on the model and I
feel like anybody car type can just wear
this dress and feel quite cute if you
don't know what to wear on a night out I
think there's nothing wrong with going
with like a you know a jersey black
dress and then I got myself just a plain
black round neck top which is a little
bit higher and it's ribbed again I love
buying basics and classic items like
this and I realize that I don't have as
many of these as I thought I did in my
wardrobe or they're really old so
there's nothing wrong with going for
like a basic round neck top so also work
for these gorgeous Mikey trainers
they've kind of been like a sickly
mustard green but I thought they were
super hot
I am definitely becoming a trainer girl
more and more and Nikes are my favor I
just feel like they're the most
flattering on my feet because I do have
big feet if you've been here for a while
you know I'm a size eight and I'm only
five foot four and that means I've got
really long boat feet but these look
good on me like playing back jeans or a
really simple look I absolutely love
something like this so how gorge are
these of course I'm a heels girl for
life and these booties are just
absolutely gorgeous they've got this
lace up detail in the back I had them on
my Instagram loads of people asking me
where they're from so I tagged them and
then it's picked o at the front as well
but I love boots that look like this
after that I bought some stuff from
Topshop online as well this weird
I don't really shop in Topshop as much
as I used to but there's some classics
there I bought this again this oversize
jumper
I love knitwear at least
of years so you'll find I end up buying
a lot more jumpers and sweaters and that
kind of thing and this has got the split
detail that I talked about really really
loving it's super cute super warm and
like kind of squidgy when you're wearing
it and then I bought these shoes as well
my sister hates these shoes she said
they look like Spears but they only look
like Spears because you know I have a
really long foot but when they're on
they don't look a speery and I've got
black flats with the lace-up details
which are from office and I just love
the fact that it was in a red and black
and then it also has the little poofy
details on the end and christmas is
coming so why not wear some cute elf
looking shoes why not it's cute gorgeous
right I finally got myself a little
poofy keyring just to put on my bag I
think I bought this at 10 pounds this is
actually from warehouse but you can find
these absolutely everywhere I wanted to
show you this parka jacket I got this
quite a while back from very coat UK and
it's a parka jacket I absolutely love
parka jacket when it does get really
cold here it's super kind of masculine
but looks really nice on but this one's
extra special because it's got this fur
trim around the hood and then the hood
is in this kind of purple color which I
thought was just so nice have so many
details on this but I thought was just
perfect and it's not that that cold yet
but once it does get cold and know that
I'm going to be wearing this all the
time for those rainy and horrible days
and it's got the quilting on the inside
as well finally I've got some awesome
bit samsara again I don't shop in Zara
as much as I used to but they do always
have some beautiful things in there that
just make you get excited and one is
this hat I had this hat on my neck
snapchat recently and this hat wait hold
on link it on properly oh oh yeah this
hat is gorgeous when I try and put it on
properly
like how cute is this hat and I'm
talking about the time I have a video
coming up on Wednesday with Victoria in
the fro so we're talking about style
essentials and I've got this hat in
there but if you want to know the Hat is
from Zara and it was about 30 pounds and
this is my first Tudor 2-tone hat and a
Swiss a gorgeous one hat hair finally I
bought this oversized jacket which is
from Zara as well it's got the large
lapels and the wraparound and there's no
buttons on it it's a really nice classic
gray coat for the autumn season the only
thing is I've seen so many women wearing
it like if I walk down the street I see
like four or five women wearing this
jacket obviously it's an amazing jacket
it's really flattering it looks so good
on so many different body types
but seeing so many women wearing it this
kind of put me off it but I do like it
do you think it's a really nice piece
but yes this is it and I love the light
large colors and everything so guys that
is it for me I will link everything in
the description bar below but yeah that
was basically I felt like that was quite
a quick haul for me actually they're
