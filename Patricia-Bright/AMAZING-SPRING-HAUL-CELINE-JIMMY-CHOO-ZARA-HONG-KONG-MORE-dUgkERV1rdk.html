a different haul for you let me say this
is a hole that is probably a little bit
more on the pricey side of things that I
bought all ever shown on this channel
and I don't usually show you this kind
of stuff because I don't like me
actually buying anything's like this is
like once a year I might go and spend
this kind of money on things but why not
share it with you I did a little post on
my Instagram and you guys really wanted
to see it and I knew I was going to show
you anyway let me be real so I've got a
couple of design the staff and I've also
got some machine inside as well because
you know I can't get enough of that
thought anyway so just for those of you
guys who want to see that and I've also
got stuff from that I bought while I was
away in Hong Kong as well I didn't buy
anything in Thailand there really wasn't
much to buy and share like this I'm
gonna stop talking and I'm gonna let you
guys get a cup of tea to really enjoy
this haul so I'll give you your moment
but the first thing I have a pair of
Jimmy Choo shoes and I was going to buy
a pair of Louboutins but I already have
a pair and I know that everyone loves it
cuz it's got the red bottom and it's
really obvious like you know Louboutins
but to be honest with you they're not
very comfortable you know what then just
not that comfortable and I thought I
really wanted the black piggles
and I found them I tried them on I was
like you know what I can't see me
wearing these are very longer they're so
uncomfortable so instead I know I kind
of gave up on the idea and went to Jimmy
Choo so I went in there not expecting
very much but I was pleasantly surprised
with shoes that I'll face it you know
killed courts and they you know they've
got the same effect as the Louboutins
but they're just ten times more
comfortable literally there's so much
more comfortable and then gorgeous
they're just a nice elegant pair of
court shoes court heels which are great
for work quite elegant and they're quite
feminine but I was like I don't really
have any like really feminine black
shoes like this and
so I wanted the pickles but I went for
these and said and the bottom is just a
beautiful suede instead of like plastic
so they I don't know they just feel
great and I love the way they look and
because they I'm holding them like a
prized possession so next I then bought
a saline bag and I say I bought hobby it
was our anniversary and Hubley basically
treated me to these goodies that you see
now which that's what I say it's only
like once a year that actually happens
and I really wanted to saline but
there's another one that I wanted and I
went to go Mike hold it and stuff I was
like it's so heavy it's empty and it's
heavy by the time your stuffing is going
to be really really heavy you know the
kind of more obvious saline bag so I saw
the tri-colored bag tricolor tote and I
thought I love this now this is the
autumn/winter style and by but I didn't
like the spring/summer color so I
definitely went for this one I think
it's got it's my favorite color because
it's got the blue black and the brown
it's very very neutral but then there's
like the pops I love it it's nice and
light and it has um this handle but it
also has the extendable one so you can
also wear it as a satchel so that's what
I really wanted I bet wanted back a bag
with attachable things on it as well
because no one always wants to walk
around like that
and obviously I just love the details
has made it it's really I've worn it
like one time and I put the stuffing
right back into it and the thing is I
don't really have anywhere to like store
my bags like visibly in my room so if
anyone's got any suggestions and how I
could do that please do let me know but
next I went to release now I don't
really buy much from Reese like when
it's full price and I usually go in the
cell that sells a really good time to go
to Reese but I just walked in and I was
looking for just I don't know a blazer
or a jacket and the place is just really
expensive and I'm like it's kind of
limousine like for that price but um I
found this jacket it's this gorgeous
military jacket
and I like felt it I touched it it's got
a little bit of satin trim on it which
kind of looks like never effect where do
you guys know I'm obsessed them in
leather and it's just got these nice
kind of satin effect pockets as well and
I just loved the color and I love the
fit and it looks really really elegant
so I also went to Zara and got a couple
of other bit and I'm looking for
something a bit more smarter I think my
Styles becoming a bit more sleek I
really want my style to become a bit
more sleek and sophisticated so I found
this black blazer it's got a bit of a
leather chims you know it's very similar
to that jacket but this is a blazer and
it's got like the leather detail is
really cool it's kind of like snakeskin
effect it's got these really cool
pockets and everything and it fits like
a glove
this is the size medium I couldn't find
a size small and this was 50 quid and I
bought this hair accessory because I saw
a girl trying it on like that and I was
like how cute is this hairpiece it maybe
doesn't affect you on camera right now
but I just need to start my hair
properly but I thought it was just a
really cool like what's it called like
Grecian style thing and I think the
festival season little hair accessories
like this are so amazing even if you can
wear it that way you buddy could wear it
that way if you wanted to for festival
season it's just a really really cute
idea and that was 15 pounds and I just
loved it I think it's gorgeous the color
looks a bit creepy on camera but it's
these must fit trousers and they have
got really good like Zara women trousers
are just really good fitting trousers
grateful work great for the office the
35 pounds and they have them in like red
blue navy this color pink loads of
different colors and I was like I wanted
to bring a bit of color into my spring
wardrobe so why not go for these so I
picked these up and I saw this shirt and
what I liked is that one it's kind of
smart right but it's not too smart I
like the blue and I like the detailing
like the black it's kind of like navy
and stitching on it so I got these bits
from she inside I ordered them ages ago
and that's the thing about she inside
the ship in does genuinely take like a
month and I bought these like a while
back I had stuff that I wanted for my
holiday and stuff but it's fine I can
wear them in summer and but luckily I
realized that I did order a number of
jackets because I got obsessed with
fleece lined jacket after I bought that
jacket from Primark like I'm sold on
fleece lined jackets and the best thing
ever so I found this cream on on there
and it just looks so warm and cozy it is
fleece lined and it's kind of like a I
don't know what fabric this is it kinda
looks like a suede but I don't it's
definitely not real suede but it's got
some nice fleece on the inside so it's
super super cozy and then I got this
really beautiful beautiful like peplum
rasca I'm becoming a bit obsessed with
the skirts like this and not pleated
skirts but the ones that I've got the
like scuba style and they have some
really good collection of those skirts
on their site as well and then I bought
this jumpsuit piece as well I'm not sure
when I'm going to wear this but I love
it it's just floral it's cute and it's
gonna be really flattering I really
wanted this so my holiday but and next
is this other scuba skirt that I bought
it's in a dog tooth it's a little bit
short I won't like lie but you know what
it's cute and it's kind of made up this
stretchy fabric and there's like no
seemed to it and there's no zip or
anything like that super weird but it's
so flattering and it's just got that
perfect scuba shape and finally this is
like my favorite favorite jacket it is
graduated to my main wardrobe and it's
again it's not fully slide when it's got
fleece colors which is good enough for
me
and it's a gray jacket with like really
cool leather detail fleece detail and
might even like first-mover detail it's
got so much detail in it I love it and
it's really really warm and I got this
in a medium as well and I'll quickly
show you my JustFab pick I picked up
this backpack I am becoming a backpack
Queen right and I saw this backpack on
the side I was like I have to have to
have to have it I love the color like I
have a black to black backpacks so I
didn't have a tan one and this is quite
any strong strong tan color but I
absolutely love it
JustFab this year have been really
really good like I got my sandals but I
virtually wore every single day while on
holiday absolutely loving it's so cute
and this backpack is gonna do me very
very well on clothes days to come and
like on my commute and stuff so I'll
quickly show you some beauty bits that
I've got the body shop has been like one
of my favorite stores recently like I'm
really loving the range especially in
the kind of vitamin e range and I had
one of the samples that they gave me a
sample of the vitamin E sinking moisture
mask and I loved it my face and loved it
was glowing so I went and bought the
full-size one because the sample was so
so good so that's a great example that
sometimes samples are just really good
use so I bought the vitamin E moisture
mask I had made when I came back my skin
is can't quite a lot and I've realized
that my skin and dried out quite a lot
as well so I've been needing a lot more
moisture and I don't like tanning I'll
be honest review especially when you
look patchy and just off key so a way to
basically kind of like get back to your
natural color or break down
hyperpigmentation is vitamin C it's a
natural product that naturally does
started it's an antiochus oxidants and
protects you from free radicals and they
have got one of the best vitamin E
serums on the market so I bought it and
the only
for ten days because vitamin C you know
is highly it's highly reactive so guards
break down like in ten days but I bought
one of them because they're so good and
while I was in Hong Kong I went to this
shop which was everywhere it's called
Sasser they loved their beauty out there
they really do care about their beauty
and I bought a whole bunch of things out
there so what a couple of of their
tightening face masks you check out my
Instagram I did like a little really
scary-looking picture of me with the
face mask on but I got their ginseng
essence moisturizing and tightening mask
I also got a vitamin C and collagen
lightening loss as well and then I
bought a whole load of eyelashes they
have eyelashes for days and the
eyelashes are really really reasonably
priced as well and they've got really
nice style so I thought you know let me
try these on and let me see what I can
find double them up I think that
eyelashes are going to be gorgeous
absolutely gorgeous I cannot wait to
wear them and I'm obsessive like finding
the dream liquid eyeliner so I bought
two or three to try over the hope that
one of them is the holy grail of
eyeliners again the stuff so reasonable
in price that it's just like I'm just
gonna buy loads of them finally I went
to skin clinics I bought my glycolic
cleanser this is my go-to dream cleanser
for whenever I have skin problem and my
pores are just looking so enlarged and
my face just doesn't look right that
always seems to make it work a lot
better and then I also bought the skin
hydrator for oily and acne points prone
skin I don't get acne but I've noticed
my skin is a lot earlier so I want to
see you know what different something
like this can actually make to my skin I
also went ahead and bought the Paula's
Choice the aah a gel and which is
basically glycolic acid at 8% because I
found that you know after going away my
skin just got really not nice like it's
not been nice that's why I haven't
really filmed like
down video like this so I'm in the
process of trying to get my skin back my
paws were looking so so large it was
just grimy I just hated it so I've been
kind of working on a skincare routine to
kind of get my face going back to normal
and better so you know how that goes so
guys that that is everything I really
hoped you enjoyed I know that all was a
little bit different for me and I know
there's like stuff that's quite
expensive and stuff but I just wanted to
show you what I got why not I'm not
gonna hide it and I'm like they don't
have it when I do and everybody likes
nice things once in the world we all do
and I still love my Primark I'm a
Topshop and my H&amp;amp;M and my key inside and
Mazzara so I ain't going anywhere but
guys I will see you around Louisville
soon I'm gonna be doing a lot more
videos this month like I'm gonna be
doing so so many videos probably gonna
try and do three videos a month on this
channel so keep your eyes peeled and I
will see you guys later love you all bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
