like I'm fun yes I'm gonna be like the
wrong bar although I sound like I have
some kind of nasal issue River okay
they're beautiful people how are you
doing I hope you are doing well I'm
excited as I always am and today I've
done something a little bit different
I'm stereotyping people like crazy right
now
and I'm doing Americana American makeup
versus British or heavy makeup and I
just will be a fun video to do I love
doing like half-and-half kind of look
and you know I feel like I'm part of
both camps 40% of my followers are from
the US so shout-out to you guys we love
you yes and then of course 50% of my
followers up on the UK you know British
pride and all that jazz and that I love
you know creators and youtubers from the
US like Patrick Starr ginger our Jackie
I nah it's my ray-ray I love my us girls
and they like they sling they sling like
literally and then I love my you Caicos
I feel like I'm right in the middle
where you know some days I just want to
have an American moment which is when I
bring out my Felicia is accent and I
know I'm gonna offend somebody because I
sound so nasally when I do the accent I
know I'm sorry but some days I just
bring her out you know and then some
days I'm like you know chill so I
thought it would be nice to kind of draw
draw some inspiration to have ohed
lipstick on my teeth to have a look at
the differences between the two
I'm stereotyping I know but let me know
what kind of side do you think you are
I'm gonna stop talking make sure you
subscribe if you're not subscribed make
sure you're following me on my social if
you are not I did giveaways a lot so
make sure you are active on my Twitter
or my Instagram but yeah we're gonna get
straight into this video and Felicia is
gonna come out as well okay so let's get
started I'm gonna moisturize my face and
I believe that you know our UK people
and our American people value you know a
face that isn't a she I'm gonna go in
with
vitamin-enriched a moisturizer this is
from Bobby Brown I love this as a
moisturizer for my face it contains shea
butter okay so when it comes to the
brows I feel like Ratish people are a
bit more
let me fill in my brow you know fill it
in make it look tidy a lot of Gaza I
know have actually naturally got amazing
brow their eyebrows they just need to
put a lip just a couple of hairs in you
know that gentle hair movement and
you're like how is that even you know
worthwhile and then I feel like
Americans they like scrub the brow like
if I watch nikkietutorials listen it's
like she is a needle I'm going in with
my paradise brow pomade which is from
L'Oreal Paris and I feel like with an
American brows you can pull out that
tail it is all about that sculpt honey
but we're going to go in I'm using a
full full full coverage concealer it's
from Bobby Brown and this is the instant
full coverage concealer and I'm sure
I've shared this with you guys before my
favorite brush this is from backstage
Beauty this brush is my eyebrow brush
for you know eyebrow brush days that
line needs to be so sharp that it could
cut a bitch and then I feel like they
get the front to fade like hey it away
fading into the distance you know I feel
like my UK brow is a little bit less
sculpted and a little bit more of a
natural feel and to conceal I'm going to
use the la BL True Match concealer it's
a little bit more of a lighter coverage
and slightly closer to my skin tone I
mean they're both cute brows aren't they
this dope that's a cute brow and that's
a cute brow but different browsers let
us go in with the foundation okay
and I'm sure foundation varies based on
where you're from or like if you're a
Cali girl
New York girl I do notice that the girls
from the states get away with a bit more
of a fuller coverage foundation you know
they like that beat to look like an
actual beat I'm going to go in with the
Sephora ten hour where foundation no
light is the kind of become my every
foundation this foundation is so full of
rich yes all day I live for it I love it
I love it but I know for some people
it's like well that foundation is a lot
but for me I'm like no honey I love it
if you are in the market for affordable
brushes please take a look at these from
l'oreal paris so these are the brushes
this is the first time I believe they
have done brushes and there's also this
little kabuki brush as well I'm so here
for it because I know how hard it is to
find you know good quality drugstore
brushes I tried these in Paris and they
were amazing I think they've launched
now or they were just about to launch
you can check them out in store if I can
find them I let them down in the
description bar below but we don't all
need to spend like 8000 pounds on
brushes okay we're not all set up like
that we need quality at an affordable
price so I'm going to go ahead with the
Sephora foundation and I'm going to use
the foundation brush to apply that nice
and easily and I know this looks a bit
orange but trust me it blends so well
all this foundation brush is so so soft
and so nice the application ah I feel
like it is nice to switch to using a
brush because you can really kind of get
in there if that makes any sense this
side is free then covered I'm feeling
fancy already and then I'm gonna go
ahead with the ordinary foundation this
is a lightweight foundation I'm gonna
mix some shades they sounds really
watery can you hear that
oh it's literally liquid if you have
used these before I just can't remember
okay so that is my two different side
two different bases and now let's go in
with the concealer again I feel like
with my Americana side we can go in with
a little bit more go a little bit
heavier so again I'm gonna go in with
the Bobbi Brown instant full coverage
concealer the shade is almond this
concealer has not left my side because
I live for it oh my gosh I feel like I
need to talk with an American accent
when I do this side and white things
although I sound like I have some kind
of nasal issue I don't want to offend
anybody but girl no I love you oh my god
I sound awful I'm just gonna start back
to you that was painful gonna go ahead
with the concealer brush from L'Oreal to
just blend that all in okay and on my UK
side I'm gonna go in with the concealer
from L'Oreal Paris
I love the applicator of this it's
actually quite full coverage it's a much
lighter liquidy formula but it is it's
giving me coverage oh that's so lovely
okay here we are two different size and
I'm seeing the difference okay next up
what we gonna do next let's go into the
eyes before we go into the baking okay
so I'm gonna go for two different
palettes I'm gonna go for the shade and
light palette Kat Von D this was like my
everyday favorite palette nice and
neutral and then I'm gonna go for my
prism palette for my Americana side and
we're gonna get dramatic I'm gonna use
the shade unity on my lid just to kind
of white it out but I think we're gonna
put some glitter on and you know
blending is imperative honey's and I'm
gonna add a little satin orange just
because I love orange and I feel like
Brits rarely ever use like black for me
to applied black is like oh my god I
personally do not wear like really
really dramatic eye makeup
I feel like Jaclyn hill cuz I swear
every time I see her in like snapchat
she's got so dramatic some smoky eye on
a Thursday afternoon on her snapchat I'm
shocked but she always looked amazing
with it so let's just have a Jacqueline
Hill moment you know I'm gonna go in
with eyeliner like black eyeliner and
I'm using at my lawyer infallible liner
this liner
listen
and I'm gonna add a little of that
parallel and that's happened just under
my eye as well so these are the metallic
lip paints these are new I believe for
Christmas from L'Oreal and these are for
the lips but I'm gonna get fancy and I'm
gonna use these on my eyelids although
this are lip paint I'm gonna go ahead
and use that gorgeous gold color on my
eye because I can and that dries down so
beautifully and you know the brows got
to get that highlight as well
I hate highlighting my brow but a lot of
people love it guys these are my four
lower lashes I feel like I've got to go
big or I've got to go home ooh this pen
look gorgeous I'm gonna go in with this
liner from eiko just to add a little bit
of a nice tight line oh yes you're like
I'm about to fly off into greatness like
these eyelashes were about to take me
off into my destiny you know me okay so
that literally took about 45 minutes I
can not imagine doing this kind of I
look every single day Wow
okay now we're gonna go ahead and do you
know my British eye which a little bit
more simple just gonna go in with this
kind of hazy color as you see it gets a
lot of use this is me everyday feel like
as a Brit we just want to go for
something that's a little bit more nudie
a little bit more warm neutrals and
close to our like natural skin us but a
little bit better I'm just gonna cover
this kind of purple shade which is more
like a nudey shade for me and just add a
little bit of death what's crazy is that
my color choices are almost very similar
it's just at this side my American size
just old it just a little bit more you
know just a little bit more sass I will
say us Brits in your opinions our
mascara is our everything I know that
must go is like the number one selling
product in the UK Andy
and like women who'd rather guard with
bare face then not had mascara but come
through baby lashes we've got a little
something coming through oh okay
feel like my lashes can have a moment if
I if I let them breathe oh right hello
hello England and hello America are like
we're doing good we're doing good we're
very different though aren't we
I know we like to contour in America I'm
going to use my contour stick this is
from Matt I love it it gives me angles
it gives me chin I love that this brush
from L'Oreal has the angled contour
brush yes we're just gonna go hard we're
gonna do the Kim 3:3 you know she does
the three was it a c-shape I can't
remember what it is just to really hit
that contour my American accents come
back out we gotta hit that contour I
wonder what part of America do I sound
like I'm from someone's gonna be like
the wrong bar yes just blend that in you
see you don't even need to know how many
pies I ate this weekend yes chin life
and I'm gonna go in with the bare
minerals bare Pro you guys know I love
this I'm gonna lightly just apply that
yeah and it's a powder so you have a lot
less dramatic effect but you can build
up which I feel is like very British no
just a little just a bit angle in there
just a little snatching of the chin well
I'm I'm glowing like the Sun so what
we're gonna need to do we are going to
now begin the bacons life so I'm gonna
go in with my sash up and I'm gonna bake
under my eyes I mean and from what I've
seen on YouTube the Americans really
bake so just some I did shut pan s on
the side here wears on my British side
I'm just gonna go in with a brush and
lightly swash some powder around and
this just kind of gets rid of the shine
but it doesn't have much impact
unlike the contour this brush
so this is an excellent powder brush I'm
also gonna go in with my Laura Mercier L
in the dark just to give my face and
overall set you know I feel like I look
very natural here and here honey and
honey's like wow let's get this baked
off this brush is wonderful I don't know
it's hard I like the most now if you're
like baking there that brings next I'm
gonna go in with the glow kits also from
L'Oreal this is a highlighting palette
again I think this is new for Christmas
look at the packaging how lovely is this
oh and there's so many you are gold like
you go we're just gonna go in with this
beautiful gold here there's no glitter
in this this is a much more gentle
highlight so I think this is great or
it's pretty here but you see how lovely
that is that gold is fantastic no
glitter in here really really smooth
without like highlighting my
imperfections by over here we're just
that we're just gonna go in with some
vintage because you have to do this is
my favorite use all the time
it's Moscow Mule and ginger binge it's
actually more of a pinky color I like
that I feel like our Americans we we
like a lot more highlighter I say I said
we like I'm part of the crew
am i part of the family can I be part of
your family beautiful elegant and just
like I'm here I'm alive
okay we need some highlight on my notes
not gonna lie I'm not a fan of the light
tip of the nose beam where your nose
looks like a traffic light it's just too
much it's got a little blush because
that's what I need I feel like I can go
a little heavier on my American side
this is from Anastasia Beverly Hills
this is my favorite go-to shade but this
is also phenomenal as well but this has
got a little shimmer in it well I have
arrived I have a right to this is really
arrival and we're just gonna apply some
here but just in a little bit more of a
dispersed way you know the lips as well
we make it all count I'm going to go
in with this lip-lock ha and this is
like just a rich Oh a rich purple I'm
over drawing just a little bit cuz I
know in America everything bigger is
better sweetie look uh car that shade I
want to put it all over it's so good for
Christmas I'm gonna add the gold I'm
gonna add that metallic lip plane oh wow
it looks very metallic ah beautiful I'm
gonna go in with my lion favorite liner
for Matt bittersweet it's a really nice
light brown but like a ready Brown and
then I'm gonna go in with the Sephora
these are the cream lip stains they were
matte super hard to do this half and
half lip so guys that is a my finished
result I think it looks really cool
what's crazy is that I like both sides
equally like here's my like you know
gradual don't really care you know
London go you know we don't need to try
to I don't need to do too much it here
right and we're confident but but maybe
a little bit more chilled out and over
here we've just got Miss America who is
just fabulous and faultless all the time
honey all the time she's always got her
hair down her nails done eyelashes are
on fleek
how good does that look though I think
it looks crazy this is me though I'm
like a Saturday night this is you know
this is better than me honor on a Monday
morning to be honest with you that is
our British versus American and I am
here for I like both sides equally and
by the way I must
I'm not stereotyping I'm just basing it
based on you know just being in beauty
on YouTube and having friends from all
over and I love the difference is you
know between people and stuff like that
and I'm sure they've been Americans are
like honey I never do this this is me
every day and I know there'll be some
Brits who like Patricia I like to be
extra fly I like to have a dramatic
moment so whatever you're like let me
know in the comments below so guys thank
you for watching and I will see you
later bye
