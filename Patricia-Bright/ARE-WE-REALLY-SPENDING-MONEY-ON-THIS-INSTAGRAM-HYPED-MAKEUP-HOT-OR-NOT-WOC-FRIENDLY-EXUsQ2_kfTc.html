people welcome to my channel how are you
all doing I'm slightly suffering from
really quite bad hay fever and these
allergy pills are not really helping but
it's all good we're gonna power for it
today I am barefaced of just the browser
because I wanted to review some beauty
items I'm seeing everywhere I see them
on Instagram I sleeping with YouTube and
I'm like are they really worth there and
as we've been enjoying their you know
review process of clothing I feel it'll
be nice to kind of bring a little bit of
beauty back into it and try some stuff
because I know what it's like if you're
watching these viral Insadong videos
you're like you know is that thing a
rich worth my money like do I really
need that and I'm not gonna lie it I'm a
sucker for buying yourself as you
clearly know I've said this I'm a
commercial advertisers dream I see the
ad I want it is it's shiny do they like
it I like it
that is me all over so yeah I spent a
little money I've got a couple items and
we're just gonna see if it's actually
worth using so the number one and I tell
you the number one culprit on my list
has got to be this Vasari oil so this is
the unicorn essence and it's a skin
enhancing antioxidant serum and you've
probably seen these and it's in our
videos and for me I'm an oily go so the
idea of a plan or you on top of the
greasiest
it just didn't make any sense to me I'm
like why would you pray over and then
put makeup on from what I've seen on
this this is some kind of selim like an
oil serum I don't know how oily is a lot
and I feel like if I put this on my
makeups going to slip and slide and by
the way this cost this this cost fifty
pounds now this needs to be covered in
gold this needs to transform the mines
every skin ailment I've ever had in my
life because this is 50 pounds of oil in
the jar listen opening this up it's like
a pinky serum with some flecks in it
let's see if we always see the on
Instagram like this and this they're
doing the most but they really should be
like
managing it because 450 pounds listen
this needs to last me six years it's
very cold and it smells a bit like
bubblegum oh oh it's it's wet it's not
oily isn't only isn't oily I'm surprised
so that is literally absorbing into my
skin right now and absorbing nicely and
it isn't an oil it's kind of got a
little bit of a tacky feeling so I'm
presuming that's because it's gonna like
help stick your makeup on it'll really
feel like anything I've used before I
really like this smell though I feel
like it's the kind of thing that you'll
see the benefit when you apply your
makeup so I want to see if my makeup
looks any different when I apply it that
is 50 pounds or basically a serum it's
not oily so that's a good thing
so next I'm gonna use is this from milk
makeup and this is the blast it I
actually bought this when I was in the
US a couple of weeks back because I've
been wanting to try anything milk makeup
I didn't get any foundations or anything
but this blush stick I've seen
absolutely everywhere and haven't seen
it in the UK and it is basically a stick
primer the top of it seems quite dry
like nothing's coming off of it however
I've just applied that to my face and
here is where I've got locked pores and
on my nose loads of pause but I feel
like that has actually genuinely just
filled those out and smoothed them I'm
using on my nose area and just
throughout here because this is on my
skin I've got a lot of texture actually
doing that's really good this is done a
really good job of just filling out that
area where I've got texture yes I like
that okay next I have the facility rose
gold and Lissa this this is 45 pounds
this is expensive but it does have 24
karat gold yeah 24 karat gold honey
so yeah I can understand why it's a bit
more pricey I better be looking like 24
karat gold in this okay okay finally I
was just been trying to open that fit
there's flecks of gold in it you go
always believing your soul to be honest
I feel like that song is the anthem of
my entire life so the fact that this has
gold in it makes me it makes me happy
already like come on like come on yes
I'm gonna bring this up close so you
guys can see you like the gold yeah
you're indestructible right so let's see
what happens how do I apply my gold but
we can't go oh this this is an oil I'm
not even gonna go ham in this because
that is oily that that isn't oil oh dear
I don't feel like this is gonna end well
and what I don't know about putting
going on this was my initial fear this
was my initial fear being an oil the
unicorn essence is not an oil this is an
oil and I feel like it's got like
something floral because the word
varieties it is playing up right now it
smells nice if your luck is about to go
downhill from here if you are dry this
might be a great option for you but
applying oil before foundation for me is
a no bueno
like no bueno well let's just let's just
go through there so next time I'm using
the ordinary foundation if you guys
haven't seen or heard about this it's
been already YouTube as being the
ultimate foundation in the entire world
because it's I don't know if it's
because it's seven pounds or because the
ordinary is a very company but the
foundation is rated very highly by a lot
of trusted people and it only costs
seven pounds which is about eleven to
twelve dollars now come on that's a
bargain in foundation if it's good
listen we're gonna be stocking all the
way up on this so yes and I picked up
three different foundations because you
know when you were my colleague never
quite know what's gonna hit the spot
this is three point
to n which is deep neutral which looks
very close to my hand shade which
probably means I'll be okay for my face
the next stage is 3.2 ah this is deep
with red undertones they look extremely
similar but I can see a slight
difference and there is 3.1 why this is
deep with yellow undertones which is a
lot lighter I feel like I could mix them
all and then get the perfect shade for
me to be completely honest with you I
feel like an utter greaseball
this is quite a watery foundation and
it's unlike coverage and isn't matte so
I don't know if this is gonna be a mess
but let's just roll with it I'm gonna
mix the critical mix or free now
therefore it is very watery maybe mixing
wasn't the right idea because I'm
looking like a patchwork quilt let's
just start again let's just start from
the top
although I feel like no no no that's
that's not right it was never right I'm
gonna go the free point to red
undertones let's go and with that this
feels got kind of just applying
foundation with a wet fish it's just
making no sense to me oh gosh I look wet
I literally look wet when I apply makeup
I do not look like this I look like
water don't go chasing word for and it's
not the foundation the foundation itself
is quite a watery oil it's not a map Oh
Lord we've messed up the eyebrow I'm not
feeling this city's bond and whatever is
this is this is just a nonsense so we're
just gonna say goodbye let's apply with
a sponge the foundation itself I really
like actually feel like it looks really
natural really close to my skin the
whole thing has been messed up by
applying an oil to my oily face what is
the point in that
just look up actual hot mess my faceless
so oily right now you can actually fry
an egg on it nothing there's Joey and
then there's you effed up you really
effed up
what do i do what do I do about this yes
so while I sit here listening like the
Sun I am going to go ahead and use a
Tarte clay stick foundation to conceal
and highlight under my eyes I know that
this shape tape is really popular
unfortunately I don't have it but I do
have this from Tarte which I do actually
quite like and serve the same purpose
and I love this shade it's tan deep
honey and I'm hoping you can still take
them quite seriously because I know that
I'm glowing like burning sun rays and
this is super creamy super creamy super
slippery
right now I'm probably more so seeing as
I'm boiled all the way up but I love
love love the color you know obviously
I'm not quite a bright on your eye and
this is super pigmented I mean I feel
like this potentially could be a look I
do feel like Julie's coming back in but
this is jus on acid hey next I'm going
to go in with my Mac this is the Mac
this is a duo stick and this is I really
feel like Kim got the idea for the
contour sticks to be honest with you
McAvoy's have these joysticks and I live
for this it's really good love the color
that's where everything's just slipping
and sliding on my face do you know I'm
warming to the idea of this because
everything apprised so like crema Lee
now what would be amazing is if when I
put my powder on it didn't stay this wet
because yeah okay so next I'm hoping I
can save this look with the Laura
Mercier translucent peridot this is
clearly famous a lot of people use it in
the kind of transparent which is more
like a white color I have used that in
the past and ended up giving it away
because I found that it was just too
white for me and it gave me a bit of a
white cast but they came out with the
kind of colored versions and this is the
medium/deep which is women of color
friendly
and I believe they have other shades as
well and this is rape very very highly
again I bought this when I was in the US
and we're just gonna go in now I'm not
gonna lie I love me am I like bright
under I so for me knocked out my bright
under is a bit of a struggle that's a
night doing a nice job of just just
eating that boiler
like literally eating it eating it while
maintaining my go I'm not even mad at ha
ha I'm not even mad that has done a
wonderful job a wonderful job and I feel
like I've been able to maintain my
highlight even though it's a bit more
Brown than I normally go for do you know
I need this one over overall and I love
that powder is very very fine it has you
know matted everything down without
giving me the white cars I feel like I
have you know grown to love that white
cast a little bit I'm not even gonna lie
like I feel like I just want a touch of
yellow like just under my eyes but it's
beautiful and this isn't looking as a
mat as I normally look and that's
clearly because I've applied a layer of
oil on underneath but it is a bad and I
like it so obviously Anastasia Beverly
Hills has been having a really bad rap
so however I want over enough and say
that I'm a huge fan of the modern
renascence palette I feel like this is
the palette that everybody needs at all
time and I do you think Anastasia
Beverly Hills is highly rated all over
the internet and it's unfortunate that
this product has kind of maybe put a
little bit of a dent on their name but I
don't think it was still in their shine
because they really do focus on quality
and this is one of the baddest palettes
of all times so we're just gonna go in
and use that I'm just gonna put regal
golden okay so this is also super high
this is the textured eyeshadow palette
from huda beauty appellate and not that
familiar with and I find very very
similar to the Anastasia
coming to have a look but then obviously
it's got those kind of pressed good says
that look really nice and I'm gonna go
in with trust burn on my lid don't know
if it's cuz I'm just not very good at
using eyeshadow I do find that I I
expected a little more I'm expecting
this to be like whoa like way more
powerful I'm literally grinding it in
okay um yeah for the who the bTW I feel
like I have to use a lot to get the
payoff that I won right next up I'm
using the Too Faced better than sex and
scar art which obviously the name is
quite well it's really thick the name is
quite obviously eye catching I saw like
some nice campaigns around this stuff
what do I think it's really fluffy I
really like it but like it's catching
these lashes you guys don't know I
suffer from suffer it's like with
yourself I seek more like a get from
really curly lashes so they mix you just
cold back into a sea so I actually brush
my lashes forward not gonna lie I think
that's really nice I think that's a
really really good mascara I'm surprised
it's really like moist can you boys
mascara not really but it really did
coat my lashes they look a lot longer
and they do look fuller and they don't
know copper and I couldn't put a little
bit more on the other side of this I'd
really like the mascara I think it's
very very good okay can you see that my
duo is coming through like we're gonna
have to just laura mercier again like
seriously can we just try and live a
matte life okay so we have all seen this
absolutely everywhere and it's basically
the huda beauty lashes and I'll be
honest with you I'm a huge fan I think
they're a really really really good set
of lashes so I'm gonna go ahead and put
the Samantha's on right now and I'll
only stay for like lashes
once you put lashes on your knife is
made so next fact this is the Maybelline
master chrome I've seen this being
talked about a few times
you know what it is in Houma is like
everybody's talking about a new
highlighter but I wanted to trade this
one which is a little bit more
attainable for people so yeah let's just
get into it and it does look quite you
know juicy like liquidy you know okay
because you know some of us have the
issue of it just looking like a white
stripe but that is giving me a glow on
top of the already oil glow that is
slightly coming through but it's not all
that was excessive and little definitely
goes a long way look at that goes a long
way I feel like that is giving me major
Strowbridge major Strowbridge what's the
chrome buy faced injuries metallic
highlighter yes I like that and it's
drugstore and it's affordable and it's
really warm that is really really warm I
really like that
Ok Go me believe okay next I'm going to
finish up with some blush and this is
the Anastasia Beverly Hills this is the
blush trios I got these in my PR
unboxing I have used them before and
obviously you know I'm a she has been
known for the brows and then the iron
the colored eye shadows now moving into
blush and stuff and oh it's really good
not gonna lie it's been used before
because I feel it and that's why I'm
quite not defensive but I'm willing to
say I kind of trust Anastasia Beverly
Hills I know that they're in it to
produce good quality products but
unfortunately I'm actually allergic to
something in the liquid lipsticks and I
found that this happens quite a lot
whenever I do so and if we liquid
lipsticks especially that especially
Beverly Hills I've heard it's a type of
sunscreen that's in it that I might be
allergic to and I always end up with my
lips breaking out so I'm not going to
use that today I'm what I'm gonna use is
Kat Von D so I kind of feel is slipping
off the popular train is it just me
speaking that way like but things I
don't know I feel like it's she's not as
popular or the brand is not as popular
as it used to be it might just be in my
head but I don't know I feel like I've
noticed that firstly I'm going to line
with bittersweet also and
internet favorite is a favorite of mine
as well some really nice creamy brownie
red brick red which I find this perfect
for my lip color I'm gonna go with leat
I'm gonna blow leta skyress can name
this is a liquid lip mat oh that is
beautiful
okay so that is my final face done and
I'm gonna give you my overall honest
final thoughts on this lip so that one
is the facility oil serums not quite
sure what to call them the drop of
things like people use an Instagram I
will say the unicorn essence I really
like it I love the way it smells
and it isn't it oil it actually feels
like a serum which really soaked in
nicely into my skin and it had a little
bit of a stickiness which I feel like it
would probably be good when you apply
your makeup onto it
now 450 pounds listen you need to be
using a mili a mili drop of a drop to
really make it last but I do you think
it isn't necessary especially because I
use buy two or three serums before I put
on my makeup anyway like my normal
serums and they they're not that much
money so I do find it expect him and I'm
wondering what their like medical reason
behind it what sauce in there but yeah
the rose gold elixir I mean it looks
beautiful and there's rose gold in it
but it's oil in a jar with flakes of
gold which I cannot see flecks of gold
on my skin I am NOT shining like so
what's going on and I feel like if
you're an oily person it's gonna be a
big mistake you don't need it like if
you are someone who's dry though and
your makeup is dragon patching when you
apply it then clearly it's gonna be it
might be good for you but I feel like
it's a bit slippery I don't know maybe
that's just in my head after that it was
the ordinary foundation I thought it was
quite good it's a light coverage
foundation and I found that it was very
similar to my skin tone which is obvious
problem numero uno in
to being a woman of color and obviously
you know darker shades and stuff like
that I think these were the darkest
shade I think I was one shade that she
car which should be quite dark but I
don't know but there weren't that many
shades in this range anyway so I think
they were like three if you were like
three of your medium three if you were
dark or maybe like six six six so it
seemed balanced but the range wasn't
massive but I actually thought it was
quite good I'm shocked when it comes to
that silly Brenda or silicon sponge this
to me is a little sense like it's so
unnecessary
that's clearly why everybody used it for
like a month and then no one talks about
them ever again that will be getting
dashed in the bin like real quick and
then when it came to my eyeshadows again
I'm a fan that I'm especially from
everything else the modern renascence
color if you don't have it I think it is
a palette that every girl should have in
their like collection it's a really good
palette you can create some great looks
on it and then through the beauty
texture shallows palette again this is a
50 pound product but realistically I
feel like it was you could use some NYX
and get the same effect and again if
I've got modern Renaissance and don't
actually feel like I need these shades
here and it actually took work to get
like the payoff on my eyes that I wanted
the top clay stick bags I need to get my
hands on the shape tape I haven't got it
because it's quite hard to get taught
stuff in the UK actually unless I'm more
like QVC especially for like the darker
shades I find that that often I go out
of stock or they don't sometimes carry
them here in the UK unfortunately and
but that's that case that was really
really good oh and I've used it before
I'm a big fan I suggested it and I
recommend it and that listen that master
crime I feel like it is amazing
drugstore Maybelline yeah really good
it's actually really really good and
it's warm it's not actually it doesn't
go back to give me that white line it
kind of just was like just blending into
the blendability and then yeah my Kat
Von D lippy looks gorgeous on like I
feel like sometimes I might kind of
getting off the map knit but until when
you find our matte lip that you really
like you're set you're literally set so
you
that is me trying some of instagrams and
YouTube's had products would you guys
think have you seen these around is
anything else you think I should try do
you think you're just gonna stick to
using what you find has worked for you
and I think that's what it is some of us
we just want to find out is it worth
spending my dollar like do you need to
spend your money on this is it worth it
always it just hype and to be honest
none of its necessary but you know some
of us wanna work out how could we spend
our money if we wanted to treat
ourselves and is this any good old the
milk the milk blastic really good
because normally you know I've got large
pores on my nose it's kind of congestion
and it's him and they're depending on
you know what my homies are saying and I
feel like it looks a lot smoother than
normal like a lot smoother than normal
so I am loving that blur stick didn't
feel like it was doing me a lot when I
was doing it but now but my finish look
I feel particularly smooth so yeah
alright guys so I've done catch well my
Instagram catch with my snapchat I'm
still loving and living from my snapchat
so do fly me there and of course on my
Twitter I hope you guys have a great
week and I'll see you soon
