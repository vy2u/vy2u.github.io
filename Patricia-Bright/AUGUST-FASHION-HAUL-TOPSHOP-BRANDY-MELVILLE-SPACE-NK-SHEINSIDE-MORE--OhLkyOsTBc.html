got another whole video for you guys you
know I love doing my holes every single
month and you guys love them as well I
always say get a cup of tea and get
yourself comfortable and then give you
that moment I've got a lot here to show
you and I'm very excited I've got shoes
I've got clothes
I've got beauty bits as well and makeup
which I don't show making the knees so
first things first I bought these cats
angles or they like slippers shoes and
they're from a shop called call it
spring which is actually basically our
dough but a cheaper version of our dough
to be totally honest it's really hard to
walk around in heels all the time so
slip-on shoes are one of my favorite so
that's those and clearly I mean comfy
mode but I also finally bought myself a
pair of converses and some of you guys
who have been watching me long enough
know that I absolutely detest my feet
not because they're like ugly or
anything but they're really long I've
got really long slim boat feet and I'm a
size 8 UK size 8 which is the u.s. size
10 and a half for some of you say that's
not big and I've always struggled when
it comes to Footwear and I only own one
pair of trainers because you know
trainers just to make me look like this
this little person with little legs in
like these big shoes can get that visual
right I just hated the way I looked you
know with my feet but anyway another
story these are some nice converse hits
and what I liked about these versus like
you understand the converse is that
they're they're a bit slimmer they're
more of the plimsoll styles and the
classic style and that's what they look
like but they're really nice I'd wear
them with skinny jeans and means that
can wear some comfy shoes without
looking like a boat foot so moving away
from comfortable to glamorous either my
Steve
in heels which I bought to go to the
movie premiere and I really didn't want
to spend a lot of money but like go and
buy designer shoes or anything like that
and I thought these were nice to add
these are very sparkle Sparkle
I love my sparkle I know it's not the
kind of thing you would wear every day
but I know for like special occasions
and if you're wearing plain items you
want to go ahead and go overboard and
the accessories look at them how key are
they and I'm nothing like ankle strap as
well and they're really comfortable
extremely comfortable I wore them the
whole night didn't need to put flats on
or anything and yeah they're really high
though but I love them they're gorgeous
sikandra sandals I bought another pair
from Topshop and the reason I bought
these is because I have the Primark pair
in black and they're so uncomfortable
that they're the most limber 12 pounds
are cheap but then really really
uncomfortable to weigh so I bought
another pair and quite a bit more
expensive
these are 62 pounds with the expectation
that there'd be a lot more comfortable
so far they are I've worn them once and
they are more comfortable and I really
like the design I think no really
elegant the heel is not too high and
again the ankle strap is looking
gorgeous
sticking with Topshop I bought this
jumper it's like a crop jumper which I
really like I love the kind of blue on
me now I never used the right blue on me
right now right with the right blue it
does really work on me and yeah I'm
liking it and you know what's really
weird I'm already excited for autumn I'm
just over summer like summer whoo-hoo no
no no I want autumn to come now come on
autumns I can like layer and we're at
jumpers and cozy things I want cozy
things again is it just me now that it's
not just me I'm sure some of you guys
agree that summer is overrated
okay so and again for that um premiere
movie's premiere that I went to I bought
this beautiful dress beautiful dress
because I was contemplating you know
going and spending a lot of money on
designer dress or something like that
and I just liked you know what's the
point
I may only wear like a really
extravagant dress only once so instead I
went to Topshop lovely Topshop and I
bought this beautiful cobalt blue
bodycon dress maxi dress and it's got
that lovely shoulders I'm sorry this
dress is too long to show but I will
link a little playlist which will show
you me wearing this dress if you want to
see it I love it it's beautiful
and I would actually wear it again for
sure so and it was only 50 pounds versus
men you know 200 pounds or 300 pounds on
a dress and I'm gonna get out there so
sticking with like the whole split theme
I don't know I'm really liking a bit of
the split it's kind of sexy but classy
at the same time and I bought this it's
like a midi midi skirt and it's got this
gorgeous split just down the side so I
went online tushy inside again this
month and I'm really liking that online
store and I love online stores
especially if they've got free shipping
I bought more items from them I love
them they're stars really unique and the
stuff you find online isn't like the
stuff you find in stores so so first
things first I bought this dress and
it's just a long scared dress and this
is not doing any favors to it on the
camera for some reason you need to see
it on it's beautiful it's a lovely
material and it just fits you know just
fits your body really well without being
clingy and perfect for my body shape I'd
say and that's what that looks like
there this top here it's ah you can't
tell because it's lacy
it's a beautiful top it's a beautiful
lacy hanging top I wore it and everyone
was like that's such a nice time that
such a nice top got a lot of compliment
on this top and that's also from she
inside people who also opted me a bit
about the sizing from the website I will
say that it runs quite small I get
everything in the medium or a large if
it's on the bottom half I go for a large
because I think their model
crows modeled I'm really quite small so
yeah so I got this in the medium I
bought these two skirts and a bit sad
about them because they're a bit small I
mean I did get a medium but they are
really small I really wanted a crochet
skirt which had like this like a lower
layer just like that it's beautiful but
it's a bit short for me I could probably
get away with it but I wanted it to be
like a MIDI scuttling and it's more of a
mini skirt by default I'll show it to
you guys anyway this is my favourite my
favourite piece is this blazer I love
this blazer oh look it's not making me
look reflecting right now isn't it I
love this blazer back to all I have to
say it's just a beautiful fit you might
not be able to see the texture but it's
like a a woven fabric it's got kind of
shoulder pads but not too much it also
has this zip section as well just you
could take off the bottom half if you
wanted it to be a crop jacket it's or
just I love this jacket and then I
bought these school shorts again why
because I love my white pair so much
that I bought a pair in peach and I
bought a size medium for those who've
asked about the sizing what it is it's
like an asymmetrical pair of shorts that
look like a skirt from the front but
from the back it's short they're really
cute I love them so guys this is my
JustFab pick for August you guys know I
do the monthly subscription to JustFab
and this is what I thought this is what
I chose it's just a nice big bag I love
big bags because you can always put lots
of stuff in it they're great for
holidays they're great if you're just
wanting to throw those things in I will
say it doesn't have like a zip area in
so be careful when you're carrying it
but again if you're looking for one of
those big bags to just have everything
in that's exactly what you get with
something like this
so I finally write to brandy Mel
then I've really wanted to go to brandy
Marvin I've heard a lot about it on the
You Tube and I bought this necklace I
love the necklace I love silver and I
love triangle so yeah it's a really cool
necklace like that if you can see that
there and that was nine pounds I will
say I do think the stores a little bit
overrated from all they're like whoo-ha
I heard about it and I think they're a
little bit overpriced for what they're
selling they do have some really nice
pieces that I think are quite unique to
them but you know in terms of material
I'm not really impressed so I bought
this vest which looks already a bit
crusty because it's moving woman what
and there's makeup on it but so I'm
gonna hide the makeup it's not bad so
this vest it's really nice it's a really
soft fabric and it's 12 pounds 12 pounds
for a vest is a bit of moon but it is
nice it's lovely it's super soft I've
noticed everything in there is super
soft right which is really cool and it's
just a nice fit and shape to be honest
grabs you in all the right places
and I bought this black skirt as well I
know it looks really boring but it fit
really well and that's why I picked it
up and it's kind of meant to be creased
as you can see kind of looks like
schools but it's not it's a skirt and
this was 30 pounds again I think a bit
expensive but it will do though this is
a great thing that I got from there it
was this dress you have to see this
dress con I'm gonna be doing it
back-to-school lookbook like probably
the next video so you'll see all of a
lot of this stuff on in that video but
this dress is really really nice I love
the pattern on it so it fits beautifully
it's like really loose and flirty at the
bottom and then it's got this kind of
backless section as well and it's
crossover from a sauce I bought this
asymmetrical cobalt blue skirt you can
tell blues becoming my favorite color
and that's what that looks like fits
beautifully lovely fabric and it wasn't
too expensive this was 22 pounds and
it's a really nice fabric mover I then
but I never go into river island but I
just walked in one day like I think it's
like four days ago actually and I found
this jumper or sweater some they call it
and I know that's like a really plain
sweat or whatever but BAM look at the
back it's open at the back and that
would look really cute with like a
little Bango top inside or some jeans
and I went to American Apparel I don't
go into American Apparel regularly
because they're so expensive but I
really wanted some riding pants
I really think riding pants aren't
essential like in everyone's wardrobe so
I bought a pair in the blue and I
thought I wouldn't get in the black
because I've got the black leggings
already and the disco pants but what I
will definitely say is that my disco
pants I have one pair they have lasted
me for over two years that's how good it
is so you spin the 70 pounds or whatever
but you never need to buy them again so
next is this throw over kimono type
thing which is from H&amp;amp;M this is $14.99
really nice see-through you guys might
love my like see-through throw overs I
think it's just me it's about the hippie
and me the hippie lady so guys for the
first time ever I went to Space NK to
buy some items and I've never really
bought I would've never bought anything
from there before I wasn't ever sure on
what to buy it based on like some of the
reviews from other people on YouTube
like people people like Viviana does
makeup it kind of makes you feel like
going to these stores to get some of
these products that are talked about
that I'm actually and a bit more pricey
but maybe better in quality you know
that is to be discussed at a later date
but I must say that and I did get some
amazing
things from there I did have a couple of
items sent to me as well from a PR
company so just to let you guys know
that because I ain't mine I will own
this stuff you know first of all I
bought this product from African
botanics and it's um this slime that is
made from marula oil which is from South
Africa and supposedly they're not false
on the trees and the ladies from this
local village and defuse these nuts and
work on them and make the beautiful
products and I must say that they smell
absolutely divine amazing like amazing
so this is the mud scrub and I love it
I've used it twice already and that's
what it looks like it's like a whipped a
whipped butter smells divine like for
those of you who know I like smelling
great before I go to bed so that's the
pure oil marula oil also a body balm but
I haven't used the body balm and yet but
that's probably for like tough areas
like the elbows in the dry bits you know
the bits that gave very a shit get the
bomb
so I also bought some nail polishes from
there and these are from the late and
any expert nails collection and I must
say that they dry superfast those are
the ones that I'm wearing now and
they're really really thick and this is
the it's called Harris and show off and
you can combine them to make like two
colors okay so this is the stuff that I
want to rave about I didn't know about
Kevin or Quan
maybe I'm late but I didn't know about
Kevin the Quan until as I said a man -
Vivianna does make up said told me about
it so I got um for the lipsticks and
these are the matte lipsticks i am
wearing persistence on my lips now and
which looks like that and it's like a
move a beautiful beautiful mode it's so
so gorgeous it's absolutely beautiful it
like your rap song like a dream and the
color collection is really
really nice I have a blog post going up
about it because it's just that good
ladies and gentlemen boys and girls the
concealer is no joke like the concealer
is this isn't a review but I also bought
the concealer if you might click on seen
the review in another video please let
me know in the comments because I know
one against eye to the basket the
concealer is just amazing it's so thick
would last forever and the color is like
a beautiful it's so much warmer and
richer then I always use Mac concealer
which sometimes can look at have a bit
of a white cast there is no white cast
on this this is warm this is rich this
is like the glow of the Sun and I'm
wearing on my face now also wanted to
show you from by Terry it's the
hyaluronic blush and it's in the blush
with the color called blush fairy I love
it so it's a cream blush it's really
nice I think this is that the darkest
they have and it's like iridescent you
guys also now I love misguided
yeah misguided is they're so cheap and
cheerful that you can't not buy anything
from there and you guys saw this in my
last video this is my dress from
misguided it is six pounds ninety-nine
so for my American folk you're looking
at about ten dollars for the dress okay
now it's not the most amazing quality or
anything but for school this is the kind
of thing you can just throw on throw in
a wash like you know 20 times 30 times
and I think it will do alright to be
honest with you and then this dress I
love this dress
this was 20 pounds 19 pounds and it's in
this beautiful mint color mint is so
such a flattering color and it's such a
feminine color and that's what it looks
like and look like a ballerina in it but
what I love the most about it is the
back how cute is that back I just wanted
to show a couple more bits this necklace
is from Aldo it was the necklace that I
wore long side my cobalt blue dress and
Topshop to the movie premiere and it's
like fully beaded but
there's just all beads all over this
necklace and I love it it's a beautiful
contrast to really plain outfit a French
Connection is a store that I rarely go
to as well and I went in during the sale
time and I got this beautiful blazer
jacket and it's got like sequins and
sparkle on the back how beautiful is the
back of that how beautiful is that I've
got some blog posts wearing that as well
so I've decided to do something a little
bit different and this is based on the
fact that there are some people who are
amazing on YouTube some really big
people I will call myself like medium
sized but some people much bigger than
me and people who are much much smaller
but it's really hard to like find all
these channels so I have created a
playlist and I'm hoping on doing this
monthly of just some of my favorite
videos from lots of different girls or
lots of different channels on YouTube
and I really ask that you kind of watch
them send some love to these people as
well especially the girls who are not
massive and huge but you know just go
over there and you can get an idea of my
taste and from what I'm watching and a
lot of the stuff that I have is because
I've been inspired by other people one
of the tops I have I saw Tyler tells
wearing it and my last pair of shoes I
saw her in them and I'm gonna get them
and Barbara it's Shirley there's so many
other people to make sure you check them
out and send some love and if there are
any other channels you wish to recommend
then definitely let me know in the
comments and stuff or maybe I might find
all these new and amazing channels that
I've never seen before so guys if you're
not subscribed already make sure you do
and don't forget to check out and like
my facebook my Twitter my Instagram and
my blog moment or start where you get to
see all of this coming so guys thanks a
lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
