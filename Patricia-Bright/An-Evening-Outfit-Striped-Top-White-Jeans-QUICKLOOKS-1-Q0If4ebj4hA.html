yay it feels good to be back obviously
you guys know I love a little holiday
just have a breather and stuff like that
but I'm glad to be back doing stuff on
my channel and I'm just gonna start off
today with just a quick look because
I've realized that you guys love just
seeing pretty clothes
and just getting ideas and sometimes we
can complicate things and do them fancy
but one of the things you just want are
just really basic ideas of things that
you can buy yourselves so that's what
I'm gonna do it's just a quick outfit of
the day and probably gonna call it like
quick looks I'm gonna try to do it
weekly as well if you think that works
and if you guys think this is a good
idea
then just let me know in the comment so
today's quick look I am actually just
going out for dinner with Mike we're
probably gonna go to Nando's or
something but I like to make a bit of
effort now you know so guys let me just
quickly go through my look so obviously
you can tell my hair is really not done
this is like curls that are very very
old but I really like hair that looks
kind of messy and you guys can probably
see my cat calendar the back where
hunter thumbs up for those of you who
love cats and love cats so on my lips
this is really popular people always
answer me about this and it's actually a
drugstore lipstick it's by Revlon and
it's called sweet tart and I love this
pink is such a cute pink and it looks
great on my skin tone I love it it's
like my favorite and then I always yeah
this is it here and then I always top it
up with my mac lipglass
in Gio pink and I actually got this in
like a Christmas gift set so all my
nails
is my journey high shine and by Bobby M
and it's in the blueberry color and I am
literally wearing this all summer I love
this it's like my perimeter color so
guys this is the top that I'm wearing
it's a stripe top which is from xi
inside and i absolutely love the fact
that it's like a wrap over top like this
however there are no buttons it's just
like really loose and
material and you could probably wear a
brooch on it I'm quite comfortable
wearing it like this but you know you
could get a bit of boobage slip if
you're not careful but maybe a safety
pin actually would be really good on the
inside but I just love the drape that
you've got with it and it's just a
lovely loose fabric which is great for
the summer and I'm just wearing that
with my Michael Kors watch and a little
bracelet and I think I said the top is
from she inside I will link it in the
description box as well and then this
necklace is an old necklace from H&amp;amp;M but
I love the way it looks and the bag I'm
wearing is my JustFab pick for June I
didn't get to show it last month I
definitely wanted to show it to you guys
this month I absolutely love it it's my
new work bag firm or it's my new
everyday back I love it it's like really
structured in the tops Navy and then the
bottom is black with like this gold
hardware and it's really big and it's
got sections in it is well I think it's
a really good bag so I'm just wearing up
with this I'm gonna move down so you can
see I'm wearing white jeans which I love
for summer so here are the white jeans
that I'm wearing with it so I just love
white jeans in this um exhibit really
elegant that's what they look like there
but I'm wearing razor or wedges with
this look the guys that is my quick
video I hope you like that kind of video
