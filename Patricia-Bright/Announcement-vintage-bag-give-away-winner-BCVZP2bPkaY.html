today's video is going to be the
announcement of my vintage purse give
away the winner and I did this ages ago
i'm so so it took me so long all of you
in anticipation all of the cons the
responses and the comments were really
amazing I kind of said you know what
makes you amazing because I feel like
everyone has got some great colors
teased about them maybe a bit weird
maybe a bit awkward but make them
special and there were just like 265
comments and loads and loads of people
had great things and you're all
wonderful I kind of liked Ali's comment
because as well as a little bit
controversial and it's not necessarily
that someone would want to you know
admit about themselves or maybe be proud
of about themselves but it is an amazing
quality to have you know kind of a
questioning way to be which is it
definitely how I am so it's like how I
can manage to walk that thin line
between being stubborn and standing up
for what I believe in and listening to
another point of view and being able to
accept you even though I don't agree and
short yeah that was straight to the
point and just what I love honesty and
with brutality so Ali you are my winner
for those of you entered I'm so glad you
entered and they'll be plenty more
giveaways and going forward so thanks
watching guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
