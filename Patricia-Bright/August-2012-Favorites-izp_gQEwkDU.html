be in August favorite video yay I didn't
do a favorites last month or the month
before I don't only do that when I've
got like a decent number of things that
i want to show you and sometimes and
show random things nothing here is to
random but i'll just go ahead i'll start
off with skincare first so first of all
is this set of feel gentle skin cleaner
so I've not got skin products in this
favorite and I always loved skin
products but I tried this out and I
really liked it this is actually based
on there's a guy i watched on youtube i
can t remember her name is i'll probably
link it below and she actually made me
buy two products basically and this is a
cleanser it's a facial cleanser non
foaming cleanser and it's very very
gentle so the only one who's got am
sensitive skin like it's really good if
you feel like your skin is always dry
after bean cleanse this product is
really really good and sometimes like I
could tell if I use the skin product to
too much or if I wash my face too much
on my face feels kind of irritated I get
just these little bumps like here like
just here and it feels a little bit sore
but I started you so I'll use this like
two or three times a week and I use my
skin cleanser and that has stopped
however I have found that I'm a little
bit more oilier than I used to be and I
do get I've got right one or two spots
and I don't really get spot so this may
be because I'm not cleansing as much as
I used to or the skin cleanser is a more
like gets deeper but i must say i still
like this so basically this is again
based on that guy watched she's a
channel link in the bottom bar and the
persian babe as well this bioderma
cleansing water everyone has been going
on about this and when I was in Spain I
found this in a pharmacy there it was 22
euro so probably about 15 pounds i
bought this and i've been using it like
every other night so off every time i
use this and like to wash my face wash
my face at night i use this afterwards
I feel like for instance this doesn't
necessarily get all my makeup off but
this this baby will literally show me
what it's on my face this thing is not a
joke and I remember the first time I
used it in the morning I woke up and
Michael that other face that's really
nice today I was like oh really so that
was definitely after using this only
negatives I'd say about this is that
like it's really gentle but it tastes
really stronger if you didn't your lips
you lick your lips you have this bitter
taste and I'm like my god what is that
I've wasted on my face but it's very
very good and if I go hopefully to Paris
this year then I would um I'll get more
of this so another thing i purchased
from when I was in Spain was the low
load by marc jacobs and i absolutely
love the perfume I love the bottle first
and then there's two that they have like
this but I love this one and yeah it's
amazing i love the smell i just spray it
on this is my work smell just very very
nice not too strong and it's quite
fruity kind of caramely kind of smelly
and i hate when people try to describe
perfume smells so I'm not even going to
try and do it but yes this is definitely
a favor and how gorgeous is that bottle
for those of you who don't know I'm
actually I was really into hair and I
still am like I'm really into natural
hair care and stuff like that even
though i have chemically straightened
here when i do her hair extensions i
take good care of my own hair and i
often use natural butters and oils and
things like that basically two months
ago two months ago when i got my last
know it might been about three months
ago when i got my last treatment at the
hairdresser's which is a relaxer
treatment I basically started suffering
from itchy scalp and I have never ever
ever had itchy scalp but I was telling
you I was at the point of scratching my
scalp off it was so bad and I was like
what is this and it wasn't that the
chemical relax had been left on too long
maybe it was too harsh but I used the
sensitive if something happened after
that day that made me have mad itchy
scalp it was really really bad I wash my
hair
Lee so it's not that it was dirty or
anything like that and it wasn't like
flaky or anything it was just really
itchy like what is this and I don't know
if anyone's ever suffered from itchy
Scott before that it can actually affect
you that when you're in the night you
feel yourself scratching you wake up in
the night from scratching yourself it
doesn't make any sense it wasn't good so
I let that go on because I didn't really
think about here and then I let that go
on for about two months and then I got
my thinking again when i get mine XOXO
hopefully like it should be fine got my
next one the itching decided they wanted
to continue I said no I'm not having
this I'm not going to have this so one
thing I do know is that natural oils and
essential oils are really really good so
there's a website I've used for years
and it's cool i think it's called
naturally thinking co uk where I used to
I used to buy like liters of oils and
butters and things like that and
grapeseed oil has always been a favorite
of mine so basically I made my own hair
mix of my scalp mix of grapeseed oil and
then the essential oils are used with
lavender tea tree oil and eucalyptus I
picked up these three essential oils and
I basically mixed two drops of each to
ten milliliters of the oil and I use
that every every other night for a week
it is gone it is gone I've got to took
mine week switching like it's completely
not any stops oh I'm so so happy about
that so those are definitely my
favorites for this month or next this is
just a clothing item you might have seen
maybe I don't post everything I ever
wear but this jacket I bought from H&amp;amp;M
I've been wearing it all the time like
if I were playing back outfit I just put
this on and just add some spice to an
outfit so I love this jacket it was an
expensive at all yeah really really like
that finally it's my running trainers my
night running trainers they're so
comfortable they're so good to run in
but they are also great for like like
walking to work I have never
one of those women who might see wearing
a suit or a smart dress I'm wearing
trainers I am one of those women my
journey to work is that till hours long
and it have time to be puttering around
on the train then the underground then
another underground then the bus to get
to work uh uh I've been wearing these
and they're so comfortable so
comfortable and of them so that's it
that's why I August favorite guys so
