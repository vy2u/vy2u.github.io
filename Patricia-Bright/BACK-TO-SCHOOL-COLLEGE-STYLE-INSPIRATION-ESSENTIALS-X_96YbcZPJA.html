gonna do a video that is all about back
to school style essentials so many of
you guys have been asking me about
back-to-school I know it's coming around
the corner I'm long time out of school
guys so I'm gonna worry about there but
I'm happy to do a video like this and
these are things that I wish I knew at
the time because I'll be honest with you
my style at school was not was all that
you know I really looked crazy at school
I thought I had spell I did not have
style I thought I had style witches its
style in a way so it doesn't really
matter so much
oh and I've been watching orange is the
new back yes amazing
I basically watched the whole thing in
two days and that season one and season
two season two it was a bit dry but I
watched it in two days and I'm just like
oh my gosh but that is off the topic I'm
gonna help you guys look good when you
go back to school okay so when it comes
to going back to school I think one of
the essential things you need to think
about is actually having a uniform now
here in the UK we do have school
uniforms so don't want people who are in
college and university they're like a
bit older but I mean a uniform in the
sense of there are things that you know
that you're gonna wear all the time like
certain styles of clothing and the way
you put your clothing together because
it's so much easier in the morning the
key ways that I do this is one by color
so I always wear black white and blue
and I might add a primary color once in
a while and I know that I've always
basically wear three pieces or one piece
easy peasy
simple so I know that my bottoms usually
I go for skinny jeans you can't go wrong
with a pair of skinny jeans alright
if I switch that up I might go for like
a body con miniskirt I buy these in H&amp;amp;M
they're super cheap if we're feeling
fancy go for a pair of shorts again that
with some tights so I know that I'm
always on the bottom half and sorted out
the next thing is my top half I know
that I'm either gonna wear a round neck
top a button-down shirt or some kind of
t-shirt and to pair with the jeans or
something that I'm wearing I find it's
such an easy way to style yourself again
I love white black and blue it's just
simple and it looks well put together
and then finally my third piece is I
always know that I'm going to wear
jacket so my jacket might be a blazer it
might be a denim jacket and it might be
a long coat
though having those three pieces or a
uniform is such a good way to kind of
get reading really quickly and look like
you've made an effort and be put
together the next thing is you need your
one piece you need that one piece that
you're just gonna throw on you know
those days when you wake up and you're
like oh my gosh I have five minutes left
to go what am I gonna do you need to
already have that in your mind but it's
like that one piece thing that you just
go jump for a fruit flip it on and
you're good to go
for me it's I know a dress or jumpsuit
have that one piece you need like five
of those to be honest I need like five
of those cuz I'm the one who's always
rolling out a bed last minute calm so
have that one piece that you can throw
on really quickly
so next it's your accessories now you
don't look this is school right it's not
really time for accessorize ation right
let's beat one isn't you but I know you
want to stand out a little bit so I
think it's great to like play with like
gold jewelry for me I love little gold
jewelry at the moment I get notes from
and other stories they're pieces of
gorgeous and also you can play with your
Footwear so heels who's got time for
heels at school I know some of you guys
are there when there's guys you and
impress but know you like a baby bear be
on the way to school with your backpack
on come on take those Hills off get
yourself some fancy flats I have a
really nice pair from JustFab I have
their monthly subscription and these are
just a great pair of write cool flats
where you get bored of wearing the kind
of uniform look and now you want to
switch it up so you can Stefan Utley
switch it up by wearing some pattern or
wearing some color and I would maybe
switch out like one day in the week so
Monday Mondays you did day when you've
got some energy to try but when's there
you look like Hodor but yeah by Monday
you're you're willing to kind of like
yeah I've entered the building
finally I want to stress to hard about
what you're wearing to school let's be
honest with you a lot of days you're
gonna look cross delicious I did that so
many times it's specially during exam
season so yeah you actually need those
scruffy day books like a hoodie so guys
I hope you enjoyed that video and good
luck to all of you guys who are back to
school my piece of advice is you know
