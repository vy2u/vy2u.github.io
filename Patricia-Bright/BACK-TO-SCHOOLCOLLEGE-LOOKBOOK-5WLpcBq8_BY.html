going to do a back-to-school look but
because you guys have been asking for
ages about me doing this like on
Facebook and Twitter it's like I'll Qing
do back-to-school and I'm so sorry that
I've been a bit late hopefully this is
in time for you to go shopping and get a
couple of outfits and I wouldn't say you
let go out and break the bank or
anything like that but if you want to
get a couple of basics I've got these in
this video and I'm going to link as much
as I can in the description bar below I
just wanted to show you guys my little
multi t-shirt which is fine the nomads
t-shirt which is actually created by fun
for Louie I'll put a link in the
description bar below but how cute is
that right and I'm going to sign it as
well in this video so and anyway guys I
hope you enjoy this video and I will
catch you all later
so I'm going to start off with the
skater dress I'm a dress go all the way
and I'm of a skater dress my mom's made
a cameo appearance because she loves
being in front of the camera I love a
skater dress because they come in all
different shapes sizes patterns designs
but they're really loose and floaty you
can just throw them on I would just wear
like a little jacket over it or layer
with a little denim shell something I
love this little skater dress here
because of the neckline it's so cool
and if you're not for sharing your arms
there are always options you know long
sleeve skater dresses are super cute
like this one here so for the top half
there's lots of different options from
jumpers to t-shirts and vests and shirts
for me a basic tee is always the way to
go really simple just pair it with a
skirt or some skinny jeans it just makes
you look put together without trying too
hard X has got to be like a motif vest
or a motif tee again it just stands out
and looks super casual and super cool so
I love something like a crop jump it
because I love high-waisted trousers
really flattering and especially if it's
wooly because it's super cozy and you
don't have to go for things that are
always really plain go for something
patterned and cool you can make it
casual depending on you know the shoes
or the trousers that you wear with it
moving on to the bottom half you might
be a jeans person or a legged person or
a short person but there's lots of
options if you know me you know that I'm
obsessed with leather leggings I just
love them because they're super casual
but with a pair of heels they look
fierce
I say a pair of riding pants are a must
they're super comfortable stretchy and
actually really flattering on most
figures
and I say if you're a scat girl you
probably want to keep it loose fun and
flirty no one really has time for
bodycon at school people do like shorts
at school I wasn't one of those but I
remember at uni girls would wear shorts
even in the snow but these are really
cool pair because they kind of cover
things up as well for outerwear there's
really two things that I always stick to
number one is a blazer it makes anything
look super small especially if you're
wearing jeans and a tee next it has to
be a leather coat it just makes me feel
hard and just casual like put together
and love leather jackets I have red five
and if it's hot where you are just stick
to a denim shirt as elsewhere so for
accessories I just wanted to talk about
shoes and the bags I keep it super
simple so I actually like huge trainers
at the moment if you must wear heels
make them comfy you can't go wrong with
a pair of converses either they go with
everything
really and again comfort is imperative
slipper shoes are a great alternative to
ballet flats and especially if they've
got a cute little design on them and my
favorite sandals these are everyone's
favorites but I love these they're so
cute and they're so hard and they're
just different so moving on to the bag
obviously you want to keep it narge you
want to keep it open and this is the bag
from JustFab which does all of that and
above and the satchel is also a really
good option if you want something a
little bit more casual and as I like to
glam it up I like to have a nice
structured bag like this one from Zara
so guys I'm wishing you all the best for
the new school year be confident be
yourself and enjoy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
