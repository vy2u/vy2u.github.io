people we will welcome back to my
channel
guessing we have back here with us we
have Michael he's back and we're gonna
do another his-and-hers shock challenge
today
last time we did one of these joke
completely as a joke at the end of it I
was like yeah give us all the lights
20,000 likes I will do part two anyway
we got way over 20,000 likes so we
weren't teaching them to basically do a
hidden home shopping challenge to see
what we could find we made our way into
hmmm
we intentionally am me and see this
hoodie is very nice I actually steal it
from him and keep it for myself
honestly the mannequins he looks so good
I'm just gonna steal a whole look for my
mannequin it's just till the whole look
it's quite busy so I'm crouching down so
don't look like a total weirdo but yeah
I've been shopping for about half an
hour think I'm doing well it's got a bit
more confidence this time last time was
a bit like her a lot she'd with that I
think I've got some more ice stuff here
so hopefully it works out I tried to be
a bit more specific I got you three like
three looks I got you four looks
remaining show three two quite big bad
some H&amp;amp;M and what I will say by item
it's my affordable it's really
affordable and I feel like that visual
merchandising they basically put looks
together for you so if you're lazy you
don't have to try and create a look food
it's like me if they do make a lot
easier for you the same stuff hundred
percent yeah however their online
website is dead leave a comment there's
no who do you think did the bad job
let's do this alright first outfit is
these denim trousers and then I also
bought this top because I feel like you
look good in that yellow and mustard
mm-hmm so yeah I like them I think the
Jews work alright this this one here is
a bit too a bit too you know
it seemed like the top quite like the
color do you think those trousers look
good this child is look arrived she fit
the fit looks good the fit oh my god I'm
not trying to like be like booty popping
or whatever you do I'm not trying to do
that are you mocking me I'm definitely
shake shake so yeah this is what he
actually thinks about me yeah by the way
there's a little screen down there I
keep looking there that's why I've got a
jacket to go with it is well hold on
okay
he's a jacket this is 40 pounds thanks
nice autumn just below just the boys
just in your oversized diaper trousers
diaper Travis it's like diapers is it
look no it's not a look they say look
next I've got some of the jeans skinny
jeans as well and then I got you this
like lumberjack shirt right put your out
for and they see it looks like what you
need if you need a block of wood you
just need a lumberjack you know that we
just need the Hat you look all right you
know I kind of like here all right can I
do Lord yes stretch yes yes I can live
my live I can sit down babe you don't
need to do I do
I like it this is a look this is a
winner I really like this oh my god it's
even better with the Navy look Montel
oh dear he scared mice now this jack is
50 pounds so it's quite expensive
especially if H&amp;amp;M feels pretty thick if
you're a decent quality
I just wouldn't it needs to be warm it's
quite theory it's got kind of like sheer
you call it she's sharing on the inside
I like it yes
I can't the obsessive green I don't know
why so I just wanted you to get your
legs out
really I just wanted Michael's legs to
victory blinds you guys you know those
goggles
everybody get your goggles the chicken
drumsticks are coming out do not skip
leg day oh my gosh no you have a camel
you have a camel toe try that top with
these jogger bombs
do you like this I like this I'm alright
with the top the child is just I think
it looks nice babe I think this is a
look
I think she's boring I think it's boring
I think this is really cool mmm all
right last look last look I just had
this I got you this army jacket it's got
a hoodie as well just a little top and
this and great denim as well what do you
think of this top I really like this
actually I like the style it kind of
makes your body look isn't nice as oh
look yeah I kind of think it's not-it's
not like super super tight like I'm
trying to say but at the same time it's
not every baggy it's kind of nice in the
middle can see and it costs 80 99 that's
cheap it's affordable way right I'm
getting out my jacket like that now we
can be twins
would you ever walk outside with me like
both of us
including this it would be a little bit
corny that's a bit dead
okay little bit dead only speaker I
didn't think I was gonna like this
jacket but I think it looks pretty cool
I think it's very nice yeah put the
hoodie up you got a canary like overall
I have to say you did a good job
definitely a lot better than last time
you didn't put me in literal spandex
little black lycra yoga pants mmm so
that was an improvement all right so now
we're gonna try the other way around and
we're gonna see what happens and
Patricia tries on the stuff that I
bought for her all right so first off I
got you these jeans to wear for this
outfit look what they're called bootie
fits and to go with that I then got this
kind of like I don't know
motif jumper what is that this is fun
and then I got this bummer
as well just as I thought that would
look nice with the look and all together
all together they're not awful they look
nice you know how's my bum looking this
it looks good
it looks like a booty fit that's what
they're called booty fit I like the
jeans I've been there really nice fresh
that pops off Nikki baby
I'm Gina how old I am I cannot be
wearing yeah well you're young at heart
you've got young spirit I did test did
this top babe I detest it I mean I mean
you know it's not awful top but it just
isn't me it doesn't represent my style
at all
it's just doing the most maybe it should
bang no on this music do you think this
looks like a cool outfit yeah I did the
jacket is a really nice red colored
Buffett puffer jacket for autumn
together it isn't working separately it
works beside the jumper what's the next
look babe
okay so next oh yes so okay so for this
alright I fought let's do something a
bit different
I've saw these everywhere so that's why
I picked having major flashbacks to when
I was younger and my mum dressing me for
church and I was like I'm not going to
wear this and she made me wear it and I
ripped this shirt I went no just just
take a look at this
just just take a look at the shot just
take and then and then one and then he
wants me to wear it with this Michael
you wanted to lose this time you wanted
to lose okay whatever
we're here we're doing it you need to
turn that fits in that's not gonna help
the situation
I'm you know I'm just gonna leave this
what do you guys make this so this look
I want to give it edgy
we have pants vest talk long knitted I
still on the vine I still do and you
thought that you know it was you know
this might work it's no good one see
it's a bit edgy do you think you use
your articles I would not be caught in
my grave where
in my grave this is a look I am really
sad because I really wanted to just
enjoy myself in that cute and I just
look like a actual hobo so yeah what's
my next look darling alright so moving
on got a dress this is nice
oh this is nice that would dress must
the jumper to go to the top oh okay my
dress my jumper over my dress can't
wait that's actually a nice dress fabric
but I don't like it babes I'm not a fan
finally we have simple pair of black
skinny jeans just a staple and this talk
which I thought was quite cool bit of a
print logo top there's a nice jumper
because it is a nice color it worked
well with you we've already established
that you look good with strong colors
like this and he's just a simple pair
black jeans nice skinny jeans they look
cute the jumpers cute what you don't
want to do is the moment what you don't
want to strike a line say the dress okay
with the bright don't what we're gonna
pretend it didn't happen how much it
needs jeans are they're not the jeans
are 18 pounds 18 pounds but you see how
this is a look and not have the other
ones look no don't you see I picked it
don't try and take credit for my pick if
you didn't know I actually think the
jump is quite cute that's how much the
jumper was 9 pounds see ya
simple look this is just simple and
casual and that I can and watch in case
you don't have to be too complicated so
maybe you didn't think that but here's
my clothes final look the least because
it is a bit more me I don't hate this
this is look this is the one I would you
keep it no it's not even funny
okay so and yeah we're done let me went
pretty well I love you all kind of
constant sense of everything but
recently got this concept of sets of
optimism which is maybe one of these is
why I you know it get off yeah I think I
