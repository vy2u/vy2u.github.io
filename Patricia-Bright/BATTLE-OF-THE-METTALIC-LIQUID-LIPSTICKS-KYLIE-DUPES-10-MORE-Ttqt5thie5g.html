purple on this is looking like life I
look like I'm on some form of medication
hey guys welcome to my channel so today
we are about to do the Battle of the
metallic lipstick Alex
lipstick liquid lipstick and I've seen
so many reviews that haven't been so
good towards Kylie poor clearly sad
story but you need to think about your
product girl fryin and I've seen lots of
people kind of reviewing it and - Ben if
I don't have any other Kylie lip kit
anyway I've seen enough to think I'm not
really gonna spend my money on that
however what I ended up doing was going
on to eBay and Amazon because obviously
here in the UK there's just certain
things you just can't get and I picked
up a couple of juice and other metallic
lipsticks I saw out there that looks you
know respectable and we're kind of
affordable and I thought you know what
I'm gonna try those I'm gonna review
those and they've all basically come in
over the last few days so I was like
excited got my camera out and I'm ready
to do this yeah I've got my face wipes
to hand and I basically have the LA
flash liquid lipsticks I've got the
jewel which are a little bit more
expensive and I also have Stiller and
Milani as well so let's just get rid of
this neutral life and I'm about to get
crazy with a little bit of color I think
I'm gonna hit it up straight and I'm
going to go in with the LA studio shine
Nick luster and this color is called
Blue Blood and this is la splash and
Ella splash is but why does this smell
like chemicals it actually smells like
almost something acidic that you
wouldn't want to be on your lips like no
oh god I'll do it for YouTube
I'm gonna come in a touch more so you
get a better view of what I'm doing here
I don't know if it's in my head by for
money like my lips are burning just
because of the smell it's so strong but
the color is gorgeous
let's wait for that to dry in a bit but
that looks amazing that looks like I
basically doing it was answer to
everything that color isn't is crazy
so this color looks amazing it is super
pigmented and that weed smell has gone
and it has dried super matte on my lips
but it still has that metallic sheen
this is a yes this is definitely a yes
and I only needed one coat and so I know
that one of the discussions or problems
that people had with the coyote colors
was that you just needed like multiple
coats and they really didn't work as a
liquid lipstick but this definitely does
and it dries just that same way now
let's see what its gonna be like to get
this off because it feels like it is
stuck on oh god
this ain't coming off
oh god it hurts no no seriously this
does not want to come off that was so
hard to get off I'm not actually going
to put any more of those on till the end
I'm gonna go ahead and use it at the
other ones next I'm going to go in with
a more metallic lip creams from Milani
and this color is called raving Matt is
a good raving Matt okay it's good raving
Matt and it's kind of a vibrant metallic
purple and it smells like strawberries
and flavorings but it feels a lot
smoother on the lip and what it feels
more creamy
yes Milani come through this is very
nice
that looks bloody nice like that looks
really really nice and it feels gorgeous
on my lips not like chemicals that is
beautiful so that dries a bit more matte
but it feels good on my lips and I think
it looks really really good
right let's see what's next let's see
how this comes off
it doesn't come off like the other one
the other one feels like you're peeling
paint like hardcore pain or feel it so
this just feels like lipstick coming off
next up we're going for cinematic kiss
which is also from Milani
the colors nice but it's not for me and
it's a little opaque but I like the way
it feels and I think if you put one more
layer on perfect next up I'm going for
the Magnificent metals from Stiller and
the color I'm using is garnet which kind
of looks like burnt red and this is
actually way more like an opaque opaque
gloss I was gonna diss it but actually
it's alright
the brush is amazing I wouldn't call
this a metal liquid lipstick it's more
of a gloss but I think it's really nice
and wearable and it's kind of got like
glitter in it basically but this color
here is called kitten from Stiller as
well and it just looks like a clear
gloss this really doesn't have a
metallic effect or any color whatsoever
I feel like it's really quite clear and
picks up your lips underneath so you
might want to put it over maybe like a
matte lipstick but you might have that
you really like the color but you're
gonna make metallic no maybe but yeah I
don't know this is giving me like
princess sparkle and I'm not feeling it
next I'm moving on to liquid lipsticks
from jooa let's go in the colors I'm not
sure how they're gonna look on my skin
tone but let's just go in and see these
have quite a strong smell as well but
nice and very creamy hmm well this
definitely looks very metallic this is
some copper lips over here this color
doesn't suit me and I have bigger lips
so I know that if I go or light like
this it's not really the best for me
however I actually think the color is
nice and would be nice with maybe
someone with a different skin tone all
of different shaped lips to me but I
don't think it's that bad it's very
creamy and you'll see that right so on
my skin is showing through and you need
to probably put two layers on but it
feels good like it
feels like a quality product on my lips
so the other two colors are papaya and
Pamplemousse and to me they basically
look the same these like gold colors
they don't really suit me if they had
bronzes maybe we'll go and try that
I look like I'm on some form of
medication I'm not one prescribed by a
doctor is this gonna be a trend that
catches on I don't know I don't know
yeah my lips already feel so sore like
honestly they are burning but won't it
for YouTube but I'm gonna go ahead with
the other color which is papaya and
these gold lips are just reminding me of
the 90s where people wore black liner
and gold live it was never a good look
this is kind of more like a neon I like
this
okay so this is this color here and I
put a darker metallic on the outside to
see if it and make it look any better
but the answer to that was no however if
you have different shaped lips to me and
had a Cupid's bow and I don't know it
might look good on you I don't it yeah
here we go now seeing as I like my life
and my lips I'm gonna put vaseline the
beloved Vaseline on beforehand and
hopefully this can act as a protective
barrier beforehand you know because that
was painful so we're going with this
color here which is called Guadalupe
well that color is gorgeous I am feeling
that entirely yes I mean I can't like
these are really nice on but my lips are
hurting and it smells strange but if you
just want to look good I mean there's no
harm in it I think it's gorgeous oh and
also when you put your lips lips
together it kind of takes the product
off so don't do that
look you'll see I just did it and look
that just happened let's see if the
Vaseline made any difference huh nope
the hell that's crazy
made this product here I think it came
off slightly easier Oh looks like I've
got copper foiling on my lips now I
quite like that going in with the
Vaseline again yes then I'm gonna go in
with this color which is called and
access and war infernal eternal love so
let's see what the purple on this is
looking at life
this one doesn't look metallic metallic
but the colors go Jen is a
yeah just yeah
doesn't look that metallic but I'm
feeling it for sure next I'm going in
with this color here Katrina which kind
of looks like an oil slick
and has the same old smell there we go
Vaseline DUP let's see what it looks
like yes already it's a yes no but look
at this color
what how are you gonna be multi-tonal
what that's very nice about to buy seven
of these this color is what this color
is gorgeous I've never seen a color like
this like it's genuine he looks like an
oil spill that looks amazing if I do say
so myself wow just wow just just well I
feel like I should be in the Addams
Family like my whole look is giving me
add and family like yes I'm here I've
arrived I love this I'm impressed
impressed impressed I mean yeah I'm
gonna give you guys a little mini
rundown of my thoughts on all of it the
la splash had the best colors get black
best coverage that chemical meanness is
kind of worrying I'll check in with you
from a week from now to let you know if
I'm still alive or anything but I think
it's fine no it's I'm sure it's a prude
and all that jazz but that smells very
strong and the way that the product
doesn't come off the nips is you know
bit worrying but if it looks like this
boy I will do that all the time I'm
loving it and then the Jew era are
beautiful
really feel really good but the color
collection doesn't suit me but I think
if you're someone who's into golds and
it will suit your skin tone or your lip
shape go for it for sure the Milani ones
are beautiful and I actually quite like
the kind of sweet strawberry smell I
really liked this color here called
raving mad it was gorgeous I would
totally get these and they're not very
expensive and the stiller ones are not
liquid metals they're basically lip
glosses with sparkle in them
I mean if you want an it grosses Sparkle
go ahead but it's not a matte metallic
lipstick for sure overall I am feeling I
think if I could wear this on a regular
basis you will see me with this metallic
trend I'm enjoying it so guys I want you
to let me know what was your favorite
lip color on me leave a comment below if
you like this kind of review / first
impression style video please let me

I should try I'm gonna do it like I feel
really excited this is this looks so
good I'm going out right now to the
corner shop okay I've arrived alright

snapchat on my Instagram yeah peace out
