I'm going to review benefits new
skincare range could be right skin
radiance so I hope you enjoy this video
I hope you liked my little introduction
that's based on the comments that I had
for my last video Matt you're gonna try
and introduce I'll be doing a different
language based on the ones you guys gave
me every time so yeah this is the B
right radiance line by benefit and yes I
did get the products for free I attended
the launch event for this product line
I'm gonna take off my glasses whether I
had these on because I'm serious review
videos a series so when I do reviews
glasses must be on but they're come so
yeah went to the launch of the event and
we had a few of the products to test
that we also got some facials as well
and it was a really really good time it
was about 2:00 or so beginning of April
was the time the event was held and I
got to try out basically for the
products my sister came along as well
and she tried out some other ones so we
got to mix them up so first item I'm
gonna talk about is the foaming cleanser
now the aim of this range is really to
create radiance and really make you glow
do I think that this range dogs that yes
I definitely found that especially after
my face show and like after using it
quite consistently my face was very very
glowing and I really didn't like that my
sister was using it as well however she
is prone to breakouts and has quite
early skin and this was not how this
didn't work for her really
no she had like a really bad break out
actually and the second she stopped
using it and went back to her clean and
clear her face went back to normal as
well and I'm quite prone to breakouts in
as one I did notice that I did have a
few but my skin was very glowing but I
stopped using the foaming foaming Li
clear cleanser because I need salicylic
acid because it helps to keep my
breakouts at bay and this really is not
going to work for someone who's got
breakup skin but if you do have normal
skin and
and you want that radiance effects this
definitely does it it's filled with
amino acids antioxidants all these
things that are going to cause your skin
to come and shine and get rid of that
horrible old layer of so the next
product that I had to review was the
triple performing lotion and it's like
an emulsion emulsion and its oil free
and supposedly it's like oh if you've
got combination skin this is going to be
perfect for you so you can use it even
on your drives your dry stones or oily
zones and it can just be used for
everyone now it would either liked it
was alright I finished it
but I found that it was quite drying its
we're not drying it's not moisturizing
enough for someone like me who's got
quite dry skin like on the side and
stuff it was all I it was just nice but
through the day I still thought that my
skin was dried now for some reason me
Amorian be got different samples and she
ended up with the total moisture one and
she doesn't use it because I firmly felt
that the Ranger is just not enough for
her quite sensitive skin and then I took
this from her now this I love it's um
Hydra concentrated facial cream it's
very very moisturizing it feels like
very succulent on your skin like really
good I love this and I would purchase
this with my own money
I do like that so anyone with dry skin
and want to radiant glow this will work
very very well finally we had the it
spot
gen-i cream to test out now it's a
little bit weird because I'm not that
old you know I'm still quite beautiful
and I don't have any wrinkles yet so
it's a bit strange for me to be using
eye cream but they seem to say that it's
good to start young which I entirely
agree with so I have been using it what
I think yeah nice
cool but because I don't have a problem
with wrinkles or anything like that I
can't really tell if it's making a
difference now on the other hand my mum
took my sister's one and has been using
it consistently I really really likes it
so that could be saying something about
the quality of it but it's good to stay
young it's not heavy at all it feels
really really nice on my face and yeah
grubby so guys that is my quick review
of that the new skincare age there are
other stuff in there but I really want
they had the the hydro mist the Hydra
mist was like oh my gosh to die for
though oh it's cool it's called moisture
prep I want this benefit I want it it's
like who knows that yeah that's not
anyone something like that in you and
you kind of spray it in your face
it was beautiful that was really good we
got to try that out and you know some
other stuff as well but thanks for
watching guys if you want me to do any
other reviews and me to get serious on
you just let me know ok thanks for
watching guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
