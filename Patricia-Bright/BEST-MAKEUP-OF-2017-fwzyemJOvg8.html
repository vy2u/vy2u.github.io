shade of mud be beautiful okay be
beautiful honestly not it's rude hello
beautiful people welcome to my channel
you girl ups you are doing well today
I'm gonna show you basically how I
wished I looked in 2017 because I just
finished this makeup and I cannot
believe how good it looks because there
are plenty of times when an utter hot
mess but today I literally am in love
with this look if I do say so myself you
know you guys know I rate myself
relatively highly I implore all of you
to do that because you're all beautiful
and wonderful in your own fantastic ways
and that thing is right I do my YouTube
videos and I'm not a makeup artist you
guys know me I'm not a makeup artist I'm
just a little old girl who used to work
in finance and you know likes beauty
that I put my hand I just like makeup
I'm a fan and this is the look I've put
together with all my favorite makeup
product of 2017 and I'm like Patricia
why didn't I even make this a look I
never did this as a look I never put all
my favorites together but putting all my
favorites together I literally love what
I've been able to create and I'm gonna
show you exactly how I did that I'm
gonna share all my absolutely favorite
beauty products of 2017 I know you guys
have been asking me especially on my
snapchat for like a beauty routine like
my skincare routine and if you don't
know skincare is probably my most
favorite thing but I just never do
videos on that but you're gonna have
some good skincare stuff coming for 2018
like Android been joking I've got some
red of my soul you saw I get excited but
yeah I will have all my favorite
products listed in the description bar
below and yeah just get into this video
enjoy get comfortable hey the first
thing is we have to do the brows and I
feel like my brows have been getting a
little bit thinner
they are so struggle around the end here
but do you know what we're gonna we're
gonna make them work when it comes to my
brows though what had me just on point
for 2017 was the L'Oreal this is the
paradise Tommy
I love this pomade I'm not a huge fan of
brow gels if I'd be honest of you but
this one was really really good
what I loved is that it never dried out
the shade was really really good it got
so much usage and what I loved was that
it came with the little applicator and
that was just in here I'm gonna kind of
go I lose everything
so I need us to be in one stable steady
you know unit and then secondly it was
the the goof proof brow pencil from
benefit this is so sick I love it
although I do feel like it might be
taking out my eyebrows did my eyebrow
hairs just a little bit just sometimes I
find a few hairs on this I'm like listen
I cannot afford to look like a bald
chicken so let us be careful with this
mama why did you give me good eyebrows
and I love the little brush that this
comes with because I can just draw on
some nice little hairs now honestly I
feel like my eyebrows were always
destined to be different this one's
round and this one's straight more
naturally but that is where I concealer
is there to save life and my concealer
for 2007 this was a very very easy one
for me
it was the nas soft matte complete
concealer my shade is a Monday this
concealer why why are you so good it's
creamy it's whipped it's an amazing
concealer it's also great under eyes but
for my brows this is my go-to concealer
and if I'm having like a gentle day or
like in a simple makeup day this is the
concealer that transforms me from you
know of 3 to like a 12 I just love this
concealer this brush is from backstage
beauty this was my go-to eyebrow brush
and in general I really liked the
brushes from backstage Beauty like I
love the way I can just use this brush
just to create one sharp sharp line that
we need to be able to cut but as you can
see listen the level of coverage on this
was so ridiculous you could build it up
it's got like an air
so whipped effect I'd like to get this
all over my lid because it's also a nice
base but when I do my eyes
okay look kind of crazy and you know I
completely forgot to do Prime I'll show
you my favorite primer my primer that I
really like going to is the hydrating
face base from Bobbi Brown and why I
like it is because it's more like a
moisturizer this is just really easy for
me just to apply it on and I just love
the way it makes my foundation sit and
it's just more it's more like a
moisturizer I love this and Bobbi Brown
Skin Care is ridiculous like if you
don't know about Bobby Brown skincare
where have you been I just love the way
that kind of soaks as in soaks into my
skin
I've been radiating you know I'm just
bright Patricia bright just glowing it's
so fabulous
my favorite eyeshadow products of 2018
were very easy and it was all things who
do beauty I found it in my everyday
makeup kit and so I have the textured
eyeshadow palette and what I love is
literally that this shade this shade
this shade these are all shades that I
felt like I could wear almost every
single one of these shades and they were
literally perfect and then I would have
said the desert dust but I just want you
guys to take a little look this broke
and fell out and so did this some of
these shadows were a little bit dodgy
they were like doing struggle life and I
was like why are you doing that why are
you just falling out because you look
this palette was a good palette but why
what is this all about and then also
this is like the miniature the warm
Brown obsessions like the shades in it
oh so good so when it came to brushes
this is going to be mad but and I don't
think a lot of people know about these
brushes but they're so good and it is
the Marc Jacobs brushes these brushes
are sick yeah they're amazing what I
love is it's almost like there's a
weight in them this is what I've noticed
there's like a weight on the end and
they feel expensive they blend
beautifully they're super soft and
they're excellent quality and they're
they're just fantastic and I found that
my favorite thing to do has basically
been to use washes of reds and oranges
and just keep it really simple like this
brush when I use it it just feels like
it feels like money in my hand I can you
just see like how much
Papaji we get in these orange I'm using
this one the warm Brown and I'm going to
go in with food from this palette
honestly I feel like these palettes like
they just they just pop on me and I do
find like it's really hard for shades to
pop me you know I'm dark I'm chocolate
and I need pigment like don't play with
me don't melt into me don't turn into a
shade of mud be beautiful okay be
beautiful don't think about this palette
is that these like glittery shades
aren't they don't hold together like
they should you know but I really want
that guitar I'm just gonna fix plus it
fix plus okay so when it came to mascara
it was actually the Too Faced better
than sex mascara the two phase isn't
huge in the UK and sometimes they get PR
samples and I wasn't a huge fan of like
you know the sweet peach palette and
kind of chocolate palette I didn't
really like them to be honest with you I
don't write them but this in the scholar
I write I feel like it made my eyelashes
pop it looked really nice on me I love
it
I have virtually like impotent eyelashes
like I don't know worker that the right
term to use but they're dead like I
don't have much going on in the eyelash
department but I felt like this this
made moves you know it had a bit of a
growth see I'm not gonna lie I feel like
you know that mascara does a little
something-something to my non-existent
eyelashes like we've got we've got a
little something going on I'm gonna do
eyeliner and my eyeline has got to be
the L'Oreal infallible these are gel
waterproof eyeliner crayons they're so
black is black they look fancy
stick and they look amazing on and
they're really really comfortable so to
finish off my eyes and my favorite
lashes it's one of two so that either
the hooded booty Giselle lashes which I
don't currently have because I've run
out or the backstage Beauty lashes and
these are in Soho my eyes are actually
quite small they're quite short they're
quite small so I found that I have to go
for lashes that are very spidering quite
thin at the end or go like in out in out
in out in out but these ones are so
beautiful they graduated they're spaced
and they just look really nice and the
Giselle's are very similar and even more
spidery
at the end and I find them to be
fantastic okay so next up we are moving
to foundation like foundations hardly
possess so many good foundation about
live loads of companies when it came to
foundation but I really really love and
I feel like I want to put so many
foundations in here but I'm gonna go
with the foundation I feel that really
just I used it every day uh ever since I
first tried it out and it was actually
the Sephora ten hour wear foundation you
guys will know I bought this when I was
in Paree
but I found that this foundation was
just bomb it just popped it's full
coverage it's affordable I love the
color I love the shade I loved it and
you know I like a foundation that looks
quite rich and just song sauce I found
this to be a sumptuous foundation feels
great on I just love the way it looks
and you might notice that the shade
looks a bit lighter but once it blends
oh my gosh
like I say this all the time a rich in
color of rich in life and this is what I
feel like this foundation does okay
concealers honey can see this is a hard
one there are three to four concealers
of this year that kind of killed it for
me
number one I'm going to say Mike Kevin a
Quan said sure enhancer it's not new it
didn't come right in 2000 miss everdene
it's been around probably for about the
last seven to eight years I used to use
it about five years ago stop using it
for ages started using it again and just
remember the greatness and the
transformative power of the Kevin of
Quan I don't know what they put in this
I don't know why but it's sick right
and then what came out in summer last
year is the instant full coverage
concealer from Bobbi Brown and you know
what that's what we're gonna roll with
today the shade is golden or almond
those are two of my favorite shades
they're creamy they're full coverage
they're gold just my only issue is right
I can't bake too quickly when I use this
concealer because sometimes it moves and
just goes really weird and when I first
got this
I like Bates straight away and I brushed
it off heaven II and I was basically
like I had to redo my whole face cuz I
didn't know how to use this concealer
like in a dream world
I would like start to apply powder now
but what I found is that I have to wait
like don't do it straightaway
otherwise it does something crazy but
it's so beautiful it's so warm it's so
rich it's just it's beauty so for
contour my baby Mac you know had me set
up these are basically this was from the
Diane Kendall collaboration for
spring/summer 2017 but they've got their
other ones which are just called the
quick trick stick and it's got a
highlight and a contour this is my
everyday contour I love it there's so
much product here a hundred percent but
an infinity and not going to lie
and I prefer it to the Fenty concealers
and of course I prefer it to cakey WBE
this is gorgeous can you see how my
jawline is just being snatched one
creamy movement at a time like come on
the Christmas gels is still just hanging
hanging there but we're gonna sort that
out and like it's so creaming and the
color I find for me is just perfect okay
so for my powder I've been chained man
it's a set of buttercup I'm going to
change it in 2018 I know you guys know I
use this powder like it's going out of
fashion it's the only powder I basically
use and I love it I'm not gonna lie but
for 2017 I picked up the Laura Mercier
this is the translucent powder and I
picked up in the medium/deep and I
really really liked it sometimes it can
make me look a little bit orange but it
isn't awful and as you can see this is
their Zoe the powder brush such a big
perfect brush and love it
so another product that once they first
started using it I did not put it down
it's the Fenty Beauty kilowatt
highlighter and my combo was ginger
binge Moscow Mule it's a random that
pinky warm rosy color but I found on me
that this just looked really good like
trophy wife was a little bit of a
gimmick I don't want to say gimmick but
it was a little bit of a mess for like
every day like you're not gonna wear
that and you have to be really careful
with it whereas with this it was just
like it just sure Shawn alongside that
was this from NARS
this is the board to play kind of
palette ha this strip here die like this
honestly honestly not it's a rude it's
so good it gives you that expensive
highlight I just found this to be just a
really beautiful gentle highlight with
no glitter with no like I don't know it
just doesn't give you that stripy effect
what I love about this is that either
put it in my inner tear duct and they
just made that shine on the bridge of my
nose and it was just glory and I think
is that it's the kind of highlight I
think that suit someone he's a little
bit older isn't trying to do the most
and then I can like lay off like this
killer what on top of it for its
beautiful pinky but we're now doing the
most Patricia's gone a bit hand I kind
of realized I'm not really a blush girl
I don't really like brush on me too much
I just don't think it's amazing on me
and I don't really feel like my face
needs it like my face these contour but
doesn't necessarily need additional
blush but if I was gonna go for a blush
and say it was a favorite it was this
trio this is a blush trio and this is
called berry adore from Anastasia
Beverly Hill it's basically the only
brush I wear right there we go okay so
unfortunately my favourite lip line I
don't actually have here but it was Mac
bitter sweet that line art is like
perfect and I don't I don't know how
many years but you know I was always a
chestnut girl matte chestnut love this
as well but bittersweet was just there
like just a touch lighter and also had a
touch of a burgundy hue to it which I
found was really nice oh my god this
these do lip glow I live for these I
have a whole collection and they're
fabulous
they're an amazing little Lipton and
then verso moisturizing with a hint of
color but my lippy of the year goes to
Fenty glow vinegar many low Fenty glow
lippy of the year just because for me it
just opened up the door of lip gloss
coming back and I like lip glosses I
feel beautiful in a lip gloss and this
shade was just gorgeous it's the kind of
shape that I would like to put on other
shades I like to wear on its own and I
just feel ready feminine and gorgeous
and beautiful in it and right this year
this is
this is just Patricia for 2017 so guys
