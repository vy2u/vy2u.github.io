disease particular lon trouser MoMA see
hello lovely people welcome to my
channel I hope you are well
today we switched it up a little bit as
what will be nice on my toes is get into
a shop for once and to do a little bit
of a similar review style video but for
stores that we know are and I went into
a store that I don't normally go into
okay I'm going to be very honest to you
I am NOT a TK Maxx shopper and I know
some of you guys might be like what TK
Maxx I know it's also called TJ Maxx but
here in the UK it's called TK Maxx is
that kind of crazy and ticket Max is
kind of positioned in this play so you
don't really want to go there
your mum goes there and find some
bargains you might be able to get
designer items that I like really
discounted but a lot of the times you
can't find those good stuff and it's a
bit of it's a bit of a mess when you go
in there it's really hard to kind of
find good stuff however they've got some
good there so I went into the store and
I did a shop and we're gonna goodie
slips so as I go through a bit
explanation of my experience when it
came to going into TK Maxx
it's just when you're walking it kind of
gives you like an overwhelming headache
right sounds really bad buys that oh
gosh there's a log clothing there's a
lot of railings and they're even any
visual merchandising so literally that
it's just real social rails or trousers
and things just jumbled in often the
sizing is off like really really off and
when you go in is like right you need to
be in your I'm ready - I'm ready to
fight inside the shop to really just get
in there you need to head further deep
dive to really be able to exploit enjoy
the experience to finish I don't like
something like that it is intense but
when you do do it you can find some
goodies okay some actual goodies
the legit mouth already what he's come
home Chiba okay and white curtain cheese
per patrol shoes do you remember Juicy
Couture he remembers Judicature long as
they you were the it's cuz we had Juicy
Couture and they also have a line that
called gold label we're literally
designer items from like those of let
past season items and I've got some
really good item um shop by having me
designer items I was able to find and I
won't say to you that it's really
important to choose the right TK Maxx to
go to so if you go to a TK Maxx in a
dead area guess what you're going to get
dead clothing however if you go to TK
Maxx in like you know central London see
the central locations and so they've got
a ton of gold label item another thing
I'll say is that and the pricing is
cheap but it isn't that cheap you can
find there roaming staff for cheap right
but if you are going to buy the designer
items it's probably a third or a quarter
of the price maybe a six of the price
but it is it like yeah you can get your
items for two pounds which is what I
used to throw like TK Maxx is like but
it isn't like that basically you can
find good items discounted but you have
to search and there's an item isn't
there then it's gone and you're going to
get it so don't worry about it they
don't have more sizes of that Stella
McCartney John suit in the back they
don't have that and another thing I'll
say is that we end up shop in there
listen you might go in there for one
thing and you'll need with everything
somehow I left with gloves and a
skipping-rope I left with popcorn I left
with two lamps this bein our room I even
bought some shoes now I went to one of
the shoe department and I'm telling you
that the shoes are looking orthopedic
however I was able to find a pair that
will actually respectable so I'll show
you them on so I won't say that's what I
quite like about this or you can get a
bit excited about everything like
there's a lot of nice stuff there
listen I've talked a lot let us try on
the goodies and see what they look like
okay okay I've got like three bags
okay so first thing is this minute
shampoo and I thought this was quite
cute and I think this cost 1499 pounds
so this is like $20 it's my cell not
neat jumper it isn't an amazing amazing
but let's see what it looks like on okay
cute a bit weird because the treasurer
was the extra long arm as per usual
it isn't a bad little neat jumper and if
you can see the detail on it it's not
bad it's cute
$14.99 I mean that's a reasonable price
that is their H&amp;amp;M price as our price so
as you see it's not actually a bargain
stores not $7.99 it's not really
affordable and it's not really cheap or
anything but I actually think it looks
nice also this guy back to you from
sheet in so one of my think I might have
shown it in the wall maybe never but
quite cute alright doesn't matter of
jumper what kind of bougie in it like
hello darling
so but shoulder cleavage so the shoulder
a heart that this PT is a jacket I
wanted you to see this this is actually
quite a nice jacket and I love love love
and a biker jacket how much is this
jacket cost all right so this judge it
was 30 pounds I actually print that
expensive because this isn't thick it's
not going to like it's a nice biker
jacket I love the shape the colors a
little bit strange it kind of like a
cool brown life is a little bit washed a
little bit washed you know like maybe a
dehydrated boo like that's the kind of
color it is I like it but it isn't a
secret proper vodka jacket or anything
like that but it looks cute it's alright
I do think 30 pounds a bit much because
when you think about taking mass you
think you know 20 pounds pay but no it's
a bit more fitted than I thought and
then also I have no problem in spending
money on items at all but you know what
it is it's a little bit the expectation
so you know when I go to a certain store
I'm right listen to me 5 pounds but this
is giving me 30 pounds around
aha right this is a gold label jacket
this is by Cavalli Italian designer here
hello Italian designer
we've got Cavalli the price was 129
pounds ative but the original selling
price was 447 pounds now 3m interview I
doubt that was actually even the
original selling price because I feel
like Kylie's more expensive than that
don't know when they had a blazer for
four hundred and something pounds
sometimes I feel like they just put
prices on there who knows it
okay here's this blazer on with the
black outfit it looks cute it looks cute
with the right look I think it's nice
now don't have I think it's cuter
because it says Cavalli on it but is a
very nice hitting blades are I looking
again I look a million box you know like
it's a nice to have a karate jacket 429
pounds I don't think is bad at all
see what that looks like buttoned up
yeah I really like that I really really
like that
and it's made of like a ruin I don't
know what material it is and but it's
got a wash well hope it should you see
that the hair pick has come in that is
enough it's a nice little bit for that
now just to go out and a good pose along
you know yeah oh okay these are cute 790
right fighting seven and that these are
some leggings I hope you can see they've
got like different light it's got velvet
and then normal and then velvet right
there
these are nice these are very nice and
then you can't get legging for less then
10 pounds 15 pounds 20 pounds and use a
very good quality oh yeah these are it's
in these are eating I think I just
ripped them listen snatch me snatch me
oh yes no look at these people
look at these come on she sees it a
hooker commences oh my god am i right
yes let's see oh I'm in resolved they're
basically like elevated leggings but
then we've got to sit there literally a
leg aney material but a sick leg aney
material with a panel and a zip detail
for $7.99 yes that's redonkulous my
really is looking at a little bit hand a
little bit walk like this a bit flat but
you know I can just do a sitting curve
in that and they feel nice you know it's
really important that when you wear a
pair of jeans or leggings that you feel
nice in there look it's giving me like
I'm here girl
and this is matter how you're going to
be selling something for 129 pounds and
then $7.99 in the same shop he's getting
one today oh yeah now the crotch is a
little bit low knowing it's just a
little bit as a fetus or it just they
just ripped oh you know also rock them
with a rip I won't find a needle I'll
find a thread it'll be first year on you
and you get something that fits nice
really listen you got to work with it no
line is taught with a mission to put on
its dough changer bad now the price is
79 pounds gold label this is what their
gold label stuff looks like right size
14 more letter size 8 to 10 by business
venture banner on it I'm buying it
anyway out by the table will sew it up
we'll make it work it's a nice part like
don't keep personal maybe hit that like
that remover and usually I feel like you
are going to hate you for this I'm
playing I'm actually playing yes but if
it's very large for me like very large
for me the quality in the cut is
saddening I love it I feel like I would
just take it to a tailor to just aren't
them to just work on it for me okay
I found these knit dresses they're very
similar to each other
$14.99 and $14.99 and the way they were
looking I thought like they would snatch
me like I would be really smash so let's
try them on got this dress in the size
medium feel like it's already a little
bit large you had potential bad you know
no no no no booty poppin booty poppin
yeah I love this
um uh uh I'm an alien I'm giving you
this is not me
I need a name can you guys give me a
name I need a name but how much is this
take a smash smash in with a gorgeous
this is gorgeous they're trying this one
is very similar he came out to touch you
might be the world's best-kept secret
nice doing a little bit of the most oh I
don't know how many shoulder neckline
right it's a bit much all in one it's
not so nice I don't know I'm going to
say anything I'm not even going to do
this dudette to new how did you some of
you guys knew and didn't tell me you
didn't tell me why did you tell me and I
know there's even a secret key K Mart
shoppers unit that's what they wear
every day designer they lied and they
hid it they hid it today the secret is
revealed soon might come look at this
dress Wow nice in a good defensive
15-pound if the next thing that have a
look in the jeans department these are
actually very mode are so very mode I
think it's like a Norwegian brand or
Swedish brand something from around
those parts of the world he's a really
nice denim jean the price was twelve
pounds ninety-nine and the fit looks
like they're kind of balance so I'm
going to try these on the eye here are
these jeans on listen come on these are
nice these are actually nice they fit
well they're nice
nice style denim yeah the actual the
remoter jeans they look you and that's
the style I like the fit go keep a Mac
sex I found these wide leg trousers and
these are actually from a Ralph Lauren
hello how much does it cost
these are 34 pounds wide leg route Ralph
Lauren trousers this size I actually got
was a size six because they just seemed
massive they still seem massive so I
don't have the sizing is completely
wrong on these but I'm just going to try
it and see what it looks like on oh
these are these are not size 6
these are an ultimate fail raffle around
you see and maybe the sizing is
completely off but there's huge that
isn't if I fix wide it's so big on the
waist look at that to put a whole person
in there and a bottom is actually decent
looking at the bottom of these are quite
nice it fits right on the thigh and then
the waist if that's how you want it
should be on the waist so maybe these
are like just a failed pair of pants
actually failure they would have bit
nice how most of the deeds in-state
actually fitted these are some more
Ralph Ralph polo these are some kind of
what you call this khaki trousers these
are a size 27 normally I'm a 28 but
let's see how these look okay these are
these on gosh 27 I can just about fit of
27 I'm going to view these are giving me
Jessica Simpson and Britney Spears in
the nineties something about the way the
bottom is kicked slurring what is going
on why the button at the ankle know that
darling what's them being Burch yes
Shania Twain that is what I really like
they look very dated no Ralph Lauren
labels gonna make me everything these
look good because they don't so don't
actually know I did this to my girl I
bought this vinyl jacket to be honest
violins about to pop off for next season
get yourself some vinyl
and but it will be stuck it over you
know what so try it I thought it would
look kind of kick does it look cute does
it not look cute just one Elvis Presley
color coming on right here Matt is very
Elvis it's one of those ones that each
room you're like it's alright I don't
like it
Thomas get these collars down I'm kind
of feeling it not with these flip in
1919 trousers but I kind of like it
right which is a bit sure I like look at
that a nice really short ass how much is
this 30 pounds you got a bit out of your
mind
now okay so finally stick into the high
shine these are the only shoes that I
could find I'm telling you the shoes
were orthopedic status the shoe
selection was abysmal however I found
these brogues and I might not let me let
me try one pair of shoes on but they're
basically really really lightweight and
they were 16 pounds so let's try them on
and see what they look like but not in
these thin capri pants these need to go
sit down okay so here's the shoes I mean
they're not great but these are the
least you know medical shoes I could
find but they're not they're not amazing
I'm not feeling them to be honest with
you I'd rather take my 16 pounds 100%
elsewhere because these look grandma you
know those school shoes that your mum
bought you said these are really nice
you're like no mum
they're not nice these are what these
look like these are the school shoes
that you never wanted but your mum got
you and you have to agree in and pretend
that you like them they're just bid okay
so that was it for the clothing that I
ended up picking up I'm going to give
you my final thoughts in a second I
still thought I'll show you from the
other bits I ended up getting in TK Maxx
as I said that face is a cabin when you
go in for one thing you might read with
several things that you don't need but
it's all good I am just lovely without
skipping rope $5.99 they even have some
beauty items these say polished beauty
supplies
these are basically Beauty sponger these
are $5.99 and then I got some sportswear
and this is a New Balance how nice is
this really really nice size small the
price of this was $12.99 for a sports
top New Balance that is really really
good I also bought a dressing-gown I had
to it was so soft it was so lovely it
was calling my name I was a I need you
final thoughts my final thoughts is that
and quite eyes is all right in TK Maxx
it depends on a TK Maxx that you go to I
went to several there was something I
went into the nurture side I just can't
even be in here it's stressing me out
and then others I got excited because I
found some really good items I will say
and I think this is in life like don't
get twisted I know I do the video you
know I'm trying out five somewhere sure
some of you know affordable stuff I do
believe that you get what you pay for
and you know if you're willing to spend
a little more and you're going to get
items that are better quality I do think
you can go into a good TK Maxx and find
some sick items that you can actually
find some items that you like yes write
home about
tell your friends so your cap toe goes
I'll tell everyone let them know so
overall TK Maxx I'm here for you to be
honest I'm not mad at the stuff the
store makes me annoyed because when you
go in is just like is this Helen awesome
and why is it when you're walking you're
head is hurting it's too much stop this
too many rails it's just too much which
I think needs to be worked on but other
than that your stuff is going good so
yeah okay guys and that is the end of
this video if you are not following me

Twitter make sure you do follow me and
in the meantime I will catch you later
and I will sermon I want to add these
final statement because it's important

important to also think about the inside
