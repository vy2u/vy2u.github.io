hair tutorial and I go for this whole
kind of bombshell look and I'm
absolutely in love with what I've been
able to achieve with my hair extensions
and I've tried some new extensions and
these are by Diamond hair and I believe
I picked the Brazilian straight and this
is going to be a mini review before I do
the tutorial but I must say that you
guys know that I wear my own hair
extensions which are true levels and I
think it's always good to try and see
what else is in the market and actually
test what's good and what's not good I
haven't have a person when I like
something and I know it works I stick to
it so it was a bit of a kind of like
okay front let me actually see what
someone else is doing and how well it's
going and it's like a really it's like
an Indian texture it's Brazilian hair
but I believe it's kind of like a really
nice Indian here that isn't really shiny
but I must say this hair is really
really soft like when I put it on us oh
my gosh there's so much bounce and flow
and everything to it and I've worn it
for about three weeks now and like
you'll see on my vlog Channel when I
first did it and I really liked it I
liked my vlog channel below but and it's
really really nice basically I love it
and I will say that it really holds a
curl really really well and it's like a
perfect color there wasn't much else to
say other than I really like it it's
really soft and it looks really good
right now
do I look bombshell I feel bombshell and
oh let me just tell you how I achieved
them took a lot of clips you can get a
really glamorous look if you basically
and this has kind of getting flatter but
that's because I didn't do this side as
well as the other side
I don't mind okay so basically I use my
curling tongs but I feel that cutting
tones give you a certain curl like quite
a tight Shirley Temple curl I feel that
when you use rollers and flexi-box
chunky ones you get much more of a
luscious sexy victoria secret curl like
this like this kind of really luscious
bouncy curl you can only achieve it with
these so I curl it with the curling Tong
for us and put these in but I'm going to
just go ahead and let you watch the
cheat oil and stop talking but do you
guys like a cheat or do you think I
should do more I don't do very much of
my hair to be honest with you and I
don't do many hair of you but if you'd
like to see me do more tutorials they
leave a comment and I'll do some more
tutorials and I know lots of people want
to see how I do my weave so I might one
day show you how I do it
isn't really nothing special well I'll
see you guys later bye
so here's the hair in its natural
condition what I usually do is kind of
wash my hair and use a round brush to
blow-dry it I find this gives me a lot
more body and I must say I'm really
impressed by the quality and the
fullness of this hair so to get this
quick bombshell look I usually use a
hair tongs I use a clip just because the
flexi rods I had are really not that
good and I also use rollers for more
body in the top so just section of my
hair brush through and then I do
separate a large trunk into two small
ballistic
with the carnival wand I basically just
do a really loose lazy curl ideally I
just want to get the hair hot don't
think I did and you can see it's not the
most serious curl but it's fine because
I'm going to use a flexi rod to get the
kind of curl I want to get in here and
what you'll see is that I did the other
side a lot better than this side I was
kind of just testing out painting still
but then I get the flexi rods and I
twist that warm hair warm hot hair
around it and because these are from
power lines these are crap so I put a
clip in as well I do the same with the
middle section also so I go ahead and
use the same tactics for the front of my
hair for the bombshell look I basically
roll backwards away from my face and
then I use a roller versus a flexi rod I
find these give me a much more luscious
curl so here you can see my complete
head done obviously the flexi rod at the
back fell out it's that bad but what I
now do is basically get some hairspray
while I'm doing up each of the cars I
just wait till they're cooled down and
just start taking them out
you can see that when this side came out
it was really really nice but it it
dropped quite quickly over this side I
think I used a few more so it came out a
lot better I really like the way this
side came out I do a quick check to make
sure that their cool is well I don't
want to take these out too early but
this is a really quick way to get bouncy
coals versus waiting all night or under
a dryer so after choking I basically
blend everything else and just kind of
finger comb it through and make sure
that it looks as I wanted to look and
this is my bombshell finished look so
guys I am truly feeling myself here and
wondering if you can guess what I just
mouthed but that is the end of the
tutorial thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
