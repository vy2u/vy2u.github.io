about to be that time of year again and
from the title you can see we're about
to get Black Friday and Cyber weekend
ready now it's not something that was
huge in the UK back in the day but now
it's like the biggest thing ever and I
feel like it's really important for
those of you who are real hardcore
shoppers and you really want your
bargains to get ready to do the right
thing and make sure you shop effectively
so you don't want to get trampled and
wait outside store for hours and hours
or miss out on your best deals then I
think this video should hopefully be
useful to you now before I get started
if you're not already subscribed to my
channel please make sure you do it is
absolutely free to do I love it and give
a thumbs up for videos like this if you
find them useful and helpful so the
first thing that's really important when
it comes to shopping for Black Friday
and Cyber weekend is to make sure you
have your list ready like this is not
about I'm just gonna walk into the shops
and leisurely see and think about what
you want no honey this is not the time
to do it you need to use military
precision to get ready for your weekend
shopping making this in priority of what
you want
so my order priority when it comes to
making my list is number one electricals
so that's my camera is my drone is my
laptop techie appliances the new chip
berlet that kind of stuff I really want
a coffee machine so these are the things
that on my top of my list because I know
I'm gonna get a really good price on
them after that it's gonna be my
expensive or my designer item I know
that if I can get 20 or 30% on it it's
gonna be really useful after that it's
gonna be my seasonal essentials so
things like coats and boots that are
often a bit pricey but if you can get a
really good discount we're gonna make a
huge difference so I'll get some other
essential bits and bobs that are a bit
more throw away if you don't have a list
and a priority when it comes to shopping
you're gonna end up with a ton of tat
that you don't actually want and that
actually don't get that good a deal or
so after that you're going to need to
choose your main stores now obviously if
you're shopping online you can go to a
way more than
store but if you're not you've got to
target two or three for me I think it's
really important to hit the department
stores
so the Selfridges the Nordstrom's the
Hausa Frazier's the John Lewis as well
as hitting the electrical store SoCo E's
and Argos and Jessup's like oh the big
stores that sell a lot of item unlikely
to give you great discounts so somewhere
like Apple they don't normally
participate in Black Friday but actually
if you go to carnies they might have a
hundred pounds off like they did last
year on an Apple phone also if you
choose your stores wisely you can
hopefully just go to one place to do all
the shopping that you need and you don't
have to traipse up and down the street
so my next tip is to put your items on
hold before the the events happening so
if it's Monday right about now you
better get your carts ready if you are
shopping online one great thing that you
can try doing is putting stuff in your
cart so your normal shopping cart don't
buy anything and abandon cart and often
retailers send you an email of all the
things that you have abandoned in your
cart and sometimes they give you an
extra discount on top of the Black
Friday discount if they're not doing
that make sure you have those items safe
either the night before or the day
before so that when it comes to shopping
you don't have to click or search or
whatever you know what you want you're
going to have it in your basket and you
just have to click literally go and
there's a way you can kind of do this in
store which is kind of a bit tricky in
some places a bit funny about this but
if you go shop him physically in store
normally they'll hold items for you on
hold for two to three days so if you go
shopping on Wednesday say I want to buy
this on Friday they're not allowed to
disclose or not their cells are not
beforehand so they might be able to hold
the item for you until Friday and then
you can stroll into the store like
excuse me sir I've had something on hold
from before so if you can do that it's
gonna make your shopping life way more
easy
the next step is to be registered with
your favorite retailers so that is
following them on social media make sure
you show you're part of their mailing
list and I no less always hate to be
part of made in this but sometimes
they're really really useful so my
favorites are the pretty little things
Selfridges I absolutely love last year
they actually did at 20 percent twenty
and thirty percent sale off before Black
Friday if you were on their membership
list and you could only get it if you
had an email and last year I was able to
buy some nice things way before
themselves I got what I wanted before
everybody else knew it knew about it so
my next tip is to go into store and test
and try it beforehand if you know the
size the color that you need if it's a
makeup or lipstick or clothing
you better go into the stores beforehand
because you're not going to be able to
do it on the Black Friday or during the
sales you are gonna be dealing with a
ton of people not knowing what they're
doing it's gonna be hectic so I have it
in your mind what do you want where is
it based like get the lay of the land in
the store beforehand you need to be some
what's it called Crocodile Dundee knees
are you ready right
it's not time to be there hmmm what do I
want No so if you're gonna do the Black
Friday shenanigans and you're gonna go
in store make sure you are dressed
appropriately it is about to be hot it
is going to be like a herd of hippos
running into store you're gonna get hurt
potentially so just make sure you're
wearing the right Footwear make sure
you're wearing the right layers to get a
coat because you're not gonna need it it
gets crazy when you're shopping so my
next tip is to bring your own bag
now this one's kind of random and when
you are shopping the baskets are gonna
be for people gonna be fighting over
them if you can walk in with your own
bag but you know one of those granny
trolleys and there's no shame if you've
got a granny trolley or you can snatch
it from a granny or your own grandma
trust me you're just shopping you put
your items in there and you go to the
cash point you are not worried about
anything
if you got one of those really big I
can't bag so when you're shopping you
can just put the stuff in there and not
have to worry about everyone house it's
gonna make a huge difference for you
the worst thing you want to be is that
person fighting over a basket it's not a
good look just walk in with your own
stuff but be careful you don't get done
first shoplifting or walking out with
that bag and my next hack is to consider
having a pain and this is for those of
you who are in the position to pay off
credit cards and you know you have the
money and you can afford their vehicle
to their money you can't afford it then
stop pause it's not about using your
credit card for could just close it and
it's not that deep however if you have
the means and how to pay for something
on a credit card then it's a great way
to protect yourself when it comes to
shopping online and offline from further
discounting that you might have missed
or if there's an extra layer of
protection if something goes wrong the
great thing about credit cards is that
you do have fire protection in a lot of
circumstances but make sure you aim to
pay it off and you can afford to pay
everything off in full finally don't
panic I I know some people get excited
and they get carried away and it's a
Black Friday but do you know what you
can find clothes and shoes right they
come and they go and if you don't get
anything for no Black Friday you might
get something on Cyber Monday if you
don't get something in the Boxing Day
sales you'll get something in the
January self sales come and go and a lot
of it is just a marketing strategy to
get people to buy stuff that they don't
necessarily need to be smart about it
and try new conscientious when it comes
to your purchasing choices so guys those
are my top tips when it comes to getting
ready for the Black Friday season I hope
you find it really useful and happy
shopping I'm gonna have a link in the
description bar below of one my favorite
stores to go to as either some of my
tips and tricks and some of the key
things that I don't want to buy this
season so guys thank you for watching
and I'll see you later
