pregnancy snapback nanos isn't unhealthy
anything from walking to run into your
everyday activity hey guys welcome to my
channel today I'm going to do a health
and fitness video and I feel like I
haven't done one of these for a really
long time and obviously because I am
with a baby and I had so many questions
from people about how I company
maintained my weight and staff on this
journey but in general I've kind of been
asking myself like through the past few
years I really have been quite stable
and I do try to maintain a healthy
routine and I'm excited to go back to
just working out and being fit again and
toning up you know I want to have that
snapback so I'm going to share with you
some of my weight fitness and motivation
tips as well based on some of the
questions that you guys ask me so I've
got them on my snapchat and some have
already written down on my notebook
layered goal 19 says after the baby
comes how do you think you'll get back
to your pre-pregnancy weight so what
steps am I going to take for my
pregnancy snapback and mine are
basically going to be healthy eating I'm
going to be breastfeeding which helps of
uterus contractions and I'm going to do
lots of obliques as well to really get
my stomach back and get those muscles to
knit back again I'll start off with
walking daily walking will be my first
step and then when I'm feeling up to it
I will look at getting a personal
trainer to basically help me get fit and
toned because the bomber area is looking
all kinds of loose right about now and
the thighs are not as tight as normal so
yeah and I'll probably do weight
training as well because I find it
easier than cardio you lose way more
weight with that so yeah so what are my
tips to staying healthy and when I am
busy and I am definitely always busy /
tired and I'm not going to lie I'm not a
person who goes to the gym much and I
definitely kind of stopped going to the
gym so what I like to do is definitely
focus on what I eat that is a priority
and even while I've been pregnant
I have not eaten for two as people say
and what I tried to do is keep food as
close to its natural state as possible I
think it's better just to eat lots of
veg and I love vegetable so I have lots
of raw edge of salads and then I love
stir-fry as well and I eat loads of that
and I love myself you know some chicken
and I love myself some fish and I eat
those and I do have carbs and not anti
carbs at all but I try not to have carbs
that are over processed so next question
is how do I stay motivated when
following a fitness routine and I think
this is a really important question for
anybody who wants to be fair and I
always say it's not about focusing on a
particular goal but more about trying to
make lifestyle changes that are going to
better yourself and the one thing I love
to do to stay motivated is basically to
use apps they genuinely make a
difference and one of the apps that I
really like is earth miles if you don't
have earth miles definitely download it
it's obviously free to download and
basically what it does is track your
normal levels of activity so anything
from walking to running to your everyday
activity it basically connects to the
apps that you have on your phone so even
with Apple you have the kind of bigots
the free the Apple health which tracks
your steps and what you can see is how
much activity you have done but not only
that you're rewarded for the activity
that you do you get a discount on
healthy foods healthy snacks fitness
gear and also activities so I think it's
a really great way to stay motivated
when you use apps and tools like Earth
miles which reward you for that tivity
and you're also able to see what other
people are doing so I will share you
guys on mine I don't have lots of
followers on mine but you guys can check
it out our link in the description bar
below another question is how do I
maintain a healthy lifestyle while being
at university and I think this is an
excellent question because while I was
at uni I put on weight but I was
definitely more toned and I realized the
reason I was more toned is because I
used to walk everywhere I used to walk
to my
college campus for about 20 to 25
minutes and there and back because I was
being a cheapo and I didn't want to
catch the bus
it was great exercise but also be
careful of the health of the food
choices that you make I used to eat
Domino's pizza every day their use of
such amazing student deals it like
should I just get a Domino's with
barbecue base I do that all the time but
you can cook your own meals you can also
save some money and maintain a healthy
lifestyle while at university so how did
I manage to stay in shape while pregnant
and I think the key thing I've done is I
have been healthy when I've been eating
that concept of eating for two is a lie
don't eat for two or you will gain lots
and lots of weight but what I have done
is again it's just eating lots of whole
food a lot of vegetables I eat
vegetables that and I feel like the
vegetables you can eat as much as you
want without you can't you don't put on
weight with vegetables basically and
then the thing I've been doing is
walking so much you know I mentioned
earth miles like I've actually been able
to get lots of cool freebies and
discounts because I walk everywhere and
the reason why I decided to walk a lot
is because eventually I couldn't do I
couldn't do my workouts because I have
that I have pelvic girdle pain or SPD's
they call it and I found that you know
just walking was a great way for me to
just stay active it made me feel better
when I walk around the park it's made me
feel so much better just having that
walk I know that I can get rewards as
well from it and also I want to have a
quick labour and I don't want to be
overdue for too long walking really does
help to engage the baby's head into the
pelvis so I'm just like baby get down
there so you can come out real quick so
what are my thoughts on a waist training
I think I've mentioned this before waist
training I mean are you exercising fine
yes I think it's okay it does manipulate
your body in a way that isn't ideal I
think it does squish organs and I think
if you wear them for a short term or to
add some added pressure when you're
working out
I don't have a problem with doing it but
people who are just basically contouring
their fat you're just contouring the fat
it's going to move back or your
contouring your organs they're going to
move fat if you change on lifestyle and
you're using that to help you restrict
yourself and to add you know some
support why not this person said they're
suffering from a double chin and a
larger face how do they deal with that
welcome to my club I have a chubby face
I've always been called lollipop head
because I have like this pea head like
this and then that I always use have a
really skinny body and that doesn't
bother me at all to be honest but one
watching your weight is important
because you're going to gain weight in
your face
first probably and contouring is amazing
but also you can try doing facial
exercises as well that can help you to
slim down your face but you know what
when you get older the key thing that's
a sign of aging is that people's faces
become gone but if you've got a chubby
face you're always going to look young I
do like I said what do I put in my salad
okay I don't use salad dressing what I
do is a spoon of olive oil a spoon of
vinaigrette and squeeze of lemon juice
lots of salad dressings have so much
sugar and added fat in it there that you
don't need and if you don't know about
olive oil it's but basically a wonder
product the best benefit of olive oil or
when you eat it raw so I'll put like two
spoons of olive oil in a salad and then
vinaigrette salt and pepper and a lemon
and it tastes delicious so that's a
really good question would I ever
consider going vegan I feel like it's a
really sensitive topic because there's
lots of people who talk about it now and
everybody's like kind of on it on the
trend of veganism and I think that
there's some definite benefit to
increase in your fruit and vegetable
intake and reducing your animal fat
intake definitely right because I feel
like we live in the West where people
eat far too much of everything that they
don't actually need but to be honest I
like my meats and I like my fishes but
I'm cautious about where I get my meat
my fish from and I think it's important
to improve farming practices I consider
myself to be an omnivore through and
through and I feel like sometimes when
I've seen some concepts of veganism I'm
like it works for us here in the West
that principle does not work for someone
in the Serengeti so many people who are
dying from malnutrition and and there in
lands where they can't just eat a
vegetable diet they're people who have
to drink the blood of their cows to get
the nutrition that they need and so do I
say that I look down on them and tell
them you have to be vegan this man's out
here poked in the neck of a Carol to get
it to get fat I'm not going to tell him
go and eat that leaf it's not it's not
my place but I definitely see the
benefits to it so Michelle gullible says
what are your favorite foods to use into
movies and I love you you inspire me to
do YouTube thank you so much and I love
berries berries are quite low in sugar
and they are great to put in some movies
and they make things taste sweet and
delicious how do you get those pregnancy
abs or I don't have pregnancy abs and if
you don't know I have pop I have really
popped I have like literally no belly
for like 5 months to 5 to 6 months my
belly was small and then it was like oh
it's really big but the best way to
maintain abs is by doing obliques but I
wouldn't think about abs while you're
pregnant but to burn it if you've got
strong strong ab muscles it's not a bad
thing it's actually really good because
it helps you with your pushing you
actually push more from your abs in your
core than you do from your hoo-ha and
the tachi
Iko said what's my favorite time of the
day to work out I'm definitely a morning
workout kind of person because it kind
of invigorates me for the entire day
Chantal Milly says do I sometimes have
unhealthy food for sure obviously I am
human I love me some I mean a nose isn't
unhealthy but I do like food that
little bit fatty and stuff and I think
it's okay to treat yourself once in a
while especially if you eat lots of
whole foods all the time you know I'm
not going to kill myself over it so I'm
going to end up this question here from
girl gets real which is what have been
my pregnancy cravings and have they
mainly put on any weight and I haven't
had any cravings to be completely honest
with you the biggest thing is that I
just eat loads of fruit like I eat a lot
of fruit I probably about five pieces of
fruit a day which is probably too much
fruit there's a lots of sugar in it and
but I can't me am loving pineapple
because it's high oxygen I'm eating date
I don't like date but I'm eating them
because they're good for you at any
speed up labor and what other things
okay berries all things very
strawberries blueberries blackberries
all berries I like my thing but I've
been really lucky that I haven't craved
anything that's been too crazy but
sometimes I love me a chip shop chips if
you know what chips up chips are it's
like if you go to a proper chip shop
where it's like greasy and you get it in
the newspaper and they're like chunky
and it kind of oily but not too oily and
they're made from fresh cut potatoes yes
mmm
piece de resistance I love it
so guys that is the end of my health and
fitness routine I hope it gave you guys
a little bit of motivation and just
giving you guys some insight into where
I am I'm really excited to kind of get
back to really working on my my body and
it's not just about having that perfect
body but actually feeling good entirely
and the fact that I've been limited
physically based on pain and changes
it's kind of made me appreciate that
it's important to maintain and manage my
body because you don't have it acting
the same forever
so that's it for me but I hope you guys
enjoyed make sure you check it out there
earth miles at and add me as well so
guys thank you for watching and I'll
catch you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
