today's video is all about underwear and
I'm sharing my favourites in boobs bombs
and bodycon and I just basically have
got lots of different underwear styles
that I like to wear under different
clothing types especially if it's
clothing that's a little bit fitted or
revealing or if I want to do like some
shaping and some contouring and I feel
like videos like this are really useful
and helpful to practically give you guys
links to like things that you know you
can actually buy and actually wearing oh
my gosh that really made a big
difference in my life and there's some
items here that are actually really
really sick and and some of you guys
might be aware of it some of you guys
might not be aware of it but I hope you
guys enjoy and I just wanted to add I
have had close my tic surgery for those
of you who don't know if I had it
probably year and a half to two years
ago so I'm a little bit more
well-endowed on the top ha let's be
mature about it I will be addressing it
in the future but I've kind of avoided
doing it because it's just not that kind
of channel and I feel like I'm a grown
I'm a grown woman but and of course I
understand that lots of you guys want to
know about it so I'm sure in the near
future I will talk about it but just as
a caveat and the but you know hopefully
this applies to those of you you know
with big boobs medium boobs real boobs
fake boobs saggy boobs boobs and all the
above and in the middle so I guys get a
cup of tea if you want one I'm actually
drinking lemon and ginger it's like my
new favorite thing so um
get comfortable and I hope you enjoy
number one let's start in the boo boo
region and the first thing I'm going to
share with you is um the silicone boob
which is a really good stick on the
boobie brownie thing because you can
create some really nice cleavage you can
wear it under so many top and I think if
you're going to get any kind of you know
bra um you know a strapless ball that
kind of thing I think a silicone bra is
really really good one because it feels
really good it sticks on and if you clip
it in the middle you can give yourself
some nice cleavage depending on your
placement look at this hello
and the only thing is that sometimes the
sticky back can get a bit under Dickey
but titty tape is really really good but
you can get booby tape from lots of
different places and it really does make
a difference and this is great if you
wear something that is maybe backless as
well the only things I don't that you
get that much support from this but what
you do get is good nipple coverage and
just you know that nice squidgy feeling
and it comes in nude colors and like
pinkies I think you can even get in kind
of brownie versions as well so next up
are these amazing plunge bars these are
from fashion form I'm telling you that
if you're sewing you wear something
that's a bit low-cut and you want to
give yourself some oomph of cleavage oh
my gosh this is actually going to give
you the most amount of like I never
thought it would give me so much um and
down the middle for some reason but it
really did just bring the dolls together
and they're looking all kinds of excited
and it's really good if you have
something that's like they're teased or
is low at the front or is plunging but
you still want the boobs to look kind of
put together but you don't want the bra
strap to be seen in the middle because
it kind of goes down like this what it
really means is that you shouldn't
really see this bra strap here but you
get good support and push it this
genuinely provides so much push it it's
absolutely unbelievable and obviously it
has straps at the back you can get it in
different bra sizes and and it it's just
super super good for those you know
times that you want to show the girls
down the middle and you want to have a
bit of you know push and lift
I've actually got another one which is
great if you're wearing something that
is a low and backless now you know
that's a little bit much of skin to show
but you never know you might have that
special occasion dress and you might
want to wear it or top and so this one
has got the low-cut front and obviously
it's a bodysuit which is connected by
phone at the back just here so you get
full body support and then what you have
is kind of the sticky tape and stuff is
at the back so that will stick on to
your sides so to give you the support as
well as the support in the front but
keeping it backless so you I never knew
that things like this existed they do
and then
amazing on after this it is the secret
covers you don't have to buy expensive
new brands and stuff to get really good
support well I'm not necessarily good
support but really good coverage if
you're wearing no bra that kind of thing
but and these are really really good
these are nipple covers I've talked
about these quite a few times and these
are quite these are from secret cover I
think I bought these on Azores because
the last time I had these these were
actually quite small and it kind of
popped off but these are great if you
say you have like really big nipples or
something like that or they always like
say hello when you're trying to go
braless this is a great way to like kind
of disrupt those bad boys down and you
know look kind of demure so that no one
has to see them I've got them on
underneath here as well you probably
can't see them don't look too closely
people thank you very much but yeah
these are really really good it's kind
of sticky around the outside then it's
kind of a felt textured so your nipples
remain really comfortable and also if
you're having some bright issues it's
got a bit too big you don't have that
much money to buy something new these
are really good to just adjust your bra
to suit you if you need a bit more width
and or a bit more you know on the side I
think it's probably if you've regained a
bit away all your boobs are getting a
little bit bigger this is a great kind
of short term
tip if you can't go out and buy a new
bra straight away now if you also don't
have time and money to go ahead and buy
lots of new bras and stuff if you ever
want to change your bra or make it a bit
more strapless or suit safety or
something that's criss cross or
racerback these are really amazing for
that you can generally put in your
existing bra straps through the middle
and you're able to cause it your going
to kind of Mabel to make an X at the
back that will really bring your brass
tracks in and should mean that when
you're wearing something that's kind of
got that raised the shoulder you won't
see the straps and you don't need a new
bra or strapless bra to do that if
you've got say favorite bra that gives
you really good support these are a
great little way that you can just add
it on to an existing bra so moving on
we're going to work on the middle area
and the waist area are sadly for those
of you guys who don't know I am shaped
like a brick I have absolutely no way
I do not go in and out and I'm asking
I should have cars but sadly I do not in
the middle and you know what it's okay
you know not everyone is built like a
coca-cola bottles all of us I've just
built brick-shaped and but I have maybe
a bit more of a bun but just no way
since so so so annoying so for me as
well I've got like quite a bit of a
little pooch at the front as well it's
just the way I store fat so for me it's
all about trying to you know smooth it
out when I wear something that's body
corn and create and like a false bit of
waste you know tuck me in a little bit
so what I absolutely love is my
shapewear on my control pants so I
absolutely love my control pants Marks
and Spencers do the best control pants
like they are they are sturdy they are
made for the woman who wants the you
know suck everything in and they're
really pretty
as well and yes they can be considered
granny panties but when you're in your
body con dress and you look fly no one
has to see what's going on underneath
and I really love the fact that it kind
of just brings you in at the waist and
what you see is that there's these
panels and it's got this floral detail
on it and it really just causes
everything to curve in really really
nicely now sometimes I do find that they
can get a bit be a bit restrictive on
the fly so there are also the body con
and what's in spanks spanks they do the
like half skirt or the dress I have this
dress which is also for Marks and
Spencer so sometimes if I'm wearing like
I'd really tight dress that shorts
sometimes the shorts roll up but this
dress is really really good as well it
can be worn underneath the outfit and
this also just has panels that create
some amazing contouring I think you can
see the panel just there it really does
pull you in and create the just most
gorgeous waist ever the only thing I
don't like about this one is that you
can't wear your own bra with it so it
does bring the boobs in and you get some
just ultimate cleavage and support and
everything but sometimes with me is even
a bit much it's like roll there girls
and but no great so you can either go
for the short
shapewear or you can go for the dress as
well if you find that the shorts like
right up finally I've also got the waist
trainer now I'm going to caveat this I
don't really wear a waist trainer a lot
and then there's lots of girls who wear
these all the time and like they're
contouring their bodies and stuff now I
don't really vouch for it because I'm
not about moving my organs or name or of
having a snatch looking waist however
for some girls they've had so much
difference and impact wearing it you see
all the celebrities wearing them was
sponsored to wear them but and I won't
lie to you it does create a really nice
way shape I'm not even gonna lie to you
and but you can't wear anything that's
quite thin or really really body con
because what happens is that you can see
the ridges of of the body con thing but
if you're wearing like a t-shirt or
something that's a bit thicker material
it's really good and the one thing I
really like about it is that it's really
good at helping your posture and it
makes you kind of sit up more and a lot
the time when people look a bit
crouching a little bit horrible it's
because their posture is terrible and if
you can improve your posture you can
take off like pounds and you know lots
of grabby bits of yourself and I do like
the way it kind of gives me that good
support and makes them think about
engaging my muscles and finally people
to work to work out but I do have one
because I did get inspired by the
bandwagon I can't even lie and I will
say it does look good but I would not
recommend wearing it for like you know
to bed or for long hours or everyday
bring out for a special occasion in my
opinion but again I've seen girls have
really good results by contouring their
organs finally I didn't want to miss out
the bun area I wanted to do good buds
and body con and basically I have Bert
pads or padded underwear now and this is
that I don't actually own these well I
do own them now but I didn't have them
before I was thinking about doing this
video but I thought you know what you
know some girls need that added extra
cushion or some girls I'm inspired and
don't know how people get that cushion
and our girls who do wear padded
underwear and people be wearing padded
bras for years and years so why can't
you wear padded underwear
if you want to it's not something that I
wear a lot but I just want to show you
guys the option the only thing is my
opinion the padding is and actually that
padded and so it kind of gives you a
double bum effect so you have your own
little bit of bum and then you have a
bum on top with your bum so you've got
double bun just so it's kind of weird
and it's kind of flat so yeah I'm not
sure what I think but say if you someone
who's really really flat and you're just
pancaked at the back this could give you
just a little bit of you know baba boom
that could give you some added
confidence with when you're wearing a
body con dress or jeans on the air and
night out and I think they look actually
hilarious but you know what don't knock
it until you tried it so that is
basically it so guys I hoped you enjoyed
that video and I just wanted to share
some underwear ideas I've linked
everything in the description bar below
so you can check out these bras and see
them and all these good things and I
think it's quite fun to do videos like
this where I genuinely share some likes
girl secrets that are actually out there
and no one has to know okay don't worry
only you and your mare need to know
maybe your sister and your best friend
and all our friends and everyone on the
internet actually anyway guys I hope you
enjoyed that and I'll see you on Sunday
I should have a whole video like a
really big kind of like phone call
lookbook so just keep your eyes out I
should be doing it between 6 &amp;amp; 7 p.m.
and then yet College season is about to
begin
I've got my school story and my college
story coming up real soon so if you've
got any questions specifically about
that let me know in the comments and I
will definitely be addressed to them so
guys thank you for watching and I'll
catch you later bye
