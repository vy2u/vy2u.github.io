been in New York and I met up with my
weight and we're gonna do a fun video
today yay look at hasn't gone and seeing
as I'm British and you are East Coaster
we're going to have a little you know
game of words you know it's going to be
the is it me what is the challenge but I
don't think it's good I just made this
up it's likely right well there's other
people who've done it oh yeah I've just
written down some words here got like
proper British slang words exactly
proper British slang turban and I'm
gonna say if we're making guess what
they are and some of you guys are
probably not going to agree with some of
the terms that I put there but it
doesn't matter it doesn't matter and I
think you've got a fuse on my lipstick
let's see how where we go with it and
all my people if you know additional
work it's for the words that I've used
then yeah put them in the comments so
let's get started what do you think a
scram is a scram scram scram yeah oh I
got excited though you said scram a
scram yeah it sounds like a piece of
food I can biscuit or solo all right
close your really oh yeah oh very good
is it like a croissant or something no
it's not a piece of fish oh it's like
scratch like it's to eat like I want to
get some scram like I wanna get some
food is it me
no no good nothing it's what I just said
it's like getting food so slamming is
eating that's what it is
chirps chirps yeah does that mean you're
like trying to approach Oh
oh gosh how did you know that really
that's exactly what a guy goes I go
where are you doing it's chirping I'm
gonna win this but that's like a really
old term I bet that's not even really
tough but no one uses it anymore Baby
Doe what's hench edge um like a feeling
like another inch that's a bunch use it
in a sentence
um Oh Elvis he easy day okay yeah that's
some hench steak oh really good

whatever it sounds like and then I could
annoyed no I don't know tired so I'm so
knackered I wanted to say yeah good yes
that's a really good on it so I love
this sentence it's probably a bit cheeky
for YouTube but what is polishing a turd
now what I'm thinking this sounds like
going to the bathroom not going to the
bathroom
but number two no chance
okay the phrase is you called points but
what do you think that means
you can't like change a person or
something
