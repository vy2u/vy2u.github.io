back-to-school season so today I wanted
to give you guys some hats to help you
manage your money and I know what it's
like being a broke student whose student
loan comes in and within 10 seconds it's
gone and disappeared and you end up
living on a bread and beans for a period
of time we have all been there including
myself so I wanted to share some of my
hacks when it particularly comes to
managing and maximizing your money while
you at uni and I have partnered with
NatWest
on this video because they've got a
really cool amazing student accounts
with lots of benefits
so my first hack is basically to open up
a student bank account now most of you
guys probably already have a bank
account but not a student one and these
are absolutely great for a couple of
different reasons one you can obviously
put all your money together and focus it
for uni in one location but if you open
up a student bank account a lot of them
have little opportunities that you can
have such as discounts and offers but I
really think it's quite useful that you
can basically get an interest-free
overdraw so within that West one you can
actually get five hundred pounds in your
first term and two thousand pounds in
the other terms after that and I know
there were times where you know I just
needed to make ends meet before my
student loan dropped we have all been
there
and I felt like if you are someone who
is quite smart with money and you know
you can pay it back then having an
overdraft which is interest-free is
amazing interest free money is free
money you can actually do something
quite creative with that that might be
able to maximize your money and income
as well so my next tip is one that some
people really find quite boring and
stuff but me being than that I am I feel
like it's really cool and it's basically
to budget if you are not spending within
your means you are going to go broke
really quick and the best thing you can
do is basically work out how much you've
got coming in from things such as you
know work or student loan your parents
or interest or whatever you have
and how much you've got going out so
that is your food that is your student
fees your books all that kind of good
stuff you basically need to tally those
up and work out the difference between
the two and set a budget that you can
spend each week if you're not using
online banking it is definitely amazing
to be able to use an online banking tool
that will send you text alerts to tell
you when you're reaching your spending
limit because I'm the kind of person
that I genuinely need just a little bit
of a nudge to say you're kind of close
because we can all get a bit happy
clappy spending with our card especially
if it's interest free or it's student
loan and then we're like oh I didn't
realize that my balance was so much so
being able to receive text alert is
amazing and anything where you can
basically use your phone mobile banking
online banking to really support or help
you managing your money is a plus all
the way around so my next tip is
basically to look at what deals and
bargains you can get so that might be
the student discounts that offer to you
in-store if you use your student card
and buy a new computer or technology
equipment they often have really cool
student discounts and that kind of thing
but I think it's important for you to go
out there and see what's available to
you and as I mentioned with the NatWest
student account you actually get 1/3 of
national Express coach and I was a
person who used to basically get the
coach to London to Manchester every two
weeks to come back home and see my
family or maybe I left a mum for a time
sometimes but being able to get 1/3 of
my journey would have made my life so
much more like cheaper and amazing so
making sure you find the offers that are
available to you is really important so
yes cutting back is always great to kind
of help you maximize your money but
sometimes you need to make some extra
cash flow as well and if you don't have
a job and know it can be really really
hard to just make that extra money and
if you do have something like an
overdraft I think it's a really cool
idea to invest in yourself by using a
hundred pounds and making a thousand it
going to make a big difference to your
life and I say if you're someone who's
got skills or a gift via music be it art
beard hair styling then use some money
and invest in yourself to create
something that you can do while you're
at uni and if you do get something like
a student account with an overdraft
facility then you could potentially use
some of that money to create something
or make something and lots of you guys
know that I used to basically pay my way
through uni by doing hairdressing
through at my halls of residence and I'd
have lots of different clients and I had
everything they needed to basically get
their hair styled right and I was able
to make myself some money get some money
together invest in yourself and get
creative while focusing on your studies
as well of course now when it comes to
to food and eating I feel like as a
student I put on so much weight because
I just like ate everything I was eating
out it was dominoes because that
dominoes had to fall on Petes bed and if
they still do that and but I realize I
was getting fatter and grown broke at
the same time and I think it's a really
really good idea as a student to
actually try and milp it it really does
take some time but it's worth it in the
end because you're able to actually look
at how much money you spend on that set
of mills and how long it's going to take
you now I'm the kind of person I'd
prefer not to like have it all cooked
and I don't if you've watched a video
where I talked about meal prepping in
the past but I usually like to like just
chop everything up put them into
containers so that I can quickly make
stir fries or quick dishes every single
day and I know that right I've got
Monday's lunch dinner and breakfast
already and do that for the entire week
and then that way I end up spending so
much less money and it basically ends up
taking less time in the long term so my
next tip is to basically use your
friends and I know this sounds like kind
of bad but I don't mean it in a bad way
and I feel like basically when you get
together with your friends and you're
savvy with your money you can actually
do some great things I think like you
know creating a study group where you
end up sharing the books versus having
to buy your own books
is a great idea carpooling on might out
means that you save on petrol and taxi
fees planning to do things basically
together be be that going to a festival
where you can kind of do a group
discount or get group ticket it's a
really great way to basically make sure
that things don't cost so much if it's
just you having to pay for it on your
own if you've got a group of friends
that you really trust and you really
like you really get on and you're all
really transparent with each other get
together because more heads are better
than one and you're able to basically
use all your money and make something
and make your life a little bit easier
and share some of the load so when it
comes to spending which you eventually
have to do at least basically try and
spend smart obviously cell shopping is
great but I also believe that if you're
going to buy something buy good quality
items and I have this rule kind of one
in one out so if I'm gonna buy something
I'm Pro either gonna sell something or
something at depop or give it away or
make some money on it or give it to
younger cousin or something along those
lines to basically mean that you're not
going to just buy new stuff and keep
hoarding and gather in and whatever just
try not to do that and instead just
focus on getting one in and one out if
you are going to shop shop as savvy as
you can and don't waste money on things
that you don't really want or need when
it comes to uni you basically need a
really basic everyday almost like
uniform kind of look and then for your
night outs you can go on the cheapy and
find some items that are bargains here
and there sell stuff that you might not
wear regularly but you can pass through
to your friends and everybody share and
make what so my final words are
basically when you're going to uni you
know what I know that it's a big
investment so you really want to be
cautious with your money but not let it
get you down because I know that there's
lots of people who have money woes at
uni and it really doesn't help so just
being smart and savvy with your money is
going to be useful and if you do need
help please do you know speak to your
teachers or find some advice light
things online and make sure you look at
anything that is available to you
because there might be offers or
discount or student accounts or you know
allowances that might be available to
you that you don't even know or don't
actually find out about or grants that
you might be able to get that you didn't
realize and while you at uni make sure
you have lots of fun grow and hopefully
come out with a degree so guys I hope
you enjoyed that video and some of those
tips and tricks you'll use while you're
at uni and at least you will remember
