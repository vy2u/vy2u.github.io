going to do woke up in the morning it's
kind of quiet in the house eerily quiet
and I have this bag of stuff but I
bought from which right now let me be
honest this year was the year of wish I
didn't know about wish beforehand you

try a wish I wish and so I tried it and
I was like not sure about this place but
however I did it you guys love those
videos so I for I wanted to do a little
bit with Christmas special this is gonna
be my in my last order on wish I'm not a
huge fan but the one thing I heard you
guys say was that and there are loads of
other goodies on there like makeup I'm
not sure if I want to go blind iPhone
cases and Christmas goodies and little
trinkets and gifts so I decided you know
what
I'm gonna make an order and again I made
my order a good month and a half it's
not two months ago and I know that some
of the items still haven't arrived but
I'm not gonna break my neck or break my
back over there we're just gonna roll
with it as you can see when you order
from which you just get a ton of parcels
and your doorbell rings everyday and
your your postman thinks you're a
lunatic that's basically been happening
for the last couple of months I tried to
buy like nice Christmasy presents things
that I felt like I needed little things
so let's just open up let's just unbox
if you're not
subscribe make sure you'll follow me on
my Instagram or snapchat and what's
winner because you know that's why I can
interrupt me you guys the most but yes
Kay let's get into the video I'm excited
oh wish Christmas present clip me open
it wish Christmas presents Hey okay
false eyelashes so a lot of people did
say to me that they love going to wish
for things like eyelashes and makeup for
makeup brushes so let's just see what
these this tray of eyelashes isn't bad I
think things are pretty hot done oh hey
this is something I got for free from
wish let me just take this off so you
can see
so these are a free gift do you know
that it's kind of cute they're quite
similar to an Ardell wispy not bad not
bad at all I didn't have to pay for
these actually think they're quite cute
these are the kind of eyelashes I do
wear a little bit spy the rest can't
live but okay wish alright alright five
pack of free lashes not mad at that
okay I do not know what in the bin liner
hell this is is it you lied
you took the piss and you lied so I did
buy clothing this is literally a bin
liner that smells like a bin what the
hell is this was this meant to be a faux
leather dress let's just check the
internet we've got to see you know what
honestly they took the piss this is what
they call taking the actual piss this is
a literal bin liner and I'm actually
gonna show you what the dress was meant
to look like so far from reality and
this actually costs this bin line that
Axia that all the cities of cost 10
pounds listen I will show it to you guys
on just for your just for your own
entertainment this is a hundred percent
a shiny bin liner a shiny thin liner you
know what it's like people's like the
weddings and let you make a dress out of
random fabric this is like a really good
dress made out of a bin liner and maybe
some my chicken wire this is what this
looks like on it smells like plastic
although on it's kind of giving in
giving me a little something it makes
you looks like I made the dress out of a
bin liner and it looked
very far from how it looks like on the
website like I see the vision right the
image shows me the vision but in reality
the application is new one zero points
okay next up oh I hope this is cute
so this is a phone case like you know
what it's not bad it's not bad but I'm
not gonna lie it's a really really
flimsy AF I wanted something that was
super like kitchen cute and I sort the
phone case as well this is nice
oh this is one pound hold on you know
this is a little stocking filler you can
give this to little knees or something
this is cute you know what is yeah well
there's gonna be like 10 pounds oh
there's only one pound I'm not mad at my
one pound phone okay but hello yeah oh
my god oh my god only one pound
this isn't I'm not mad at that I love
this this is cute I'm not gonna lie it
doesn't feel very secure and I think
that if my phone dropped it would drop
out of the case in five seconds but I
love this I think it's cute yes so one
pound works button or another phone case
yes Oh hold on this was free hell
yes which Christmas this was free look
how cute that phone case is how nice is
that phone case and then what you can do
is over here over here you can slide it
that might actually be better than my
current case that's it
I'm sold and this didn't cost me
anything it was free so basically I
don't know why they've just got these
things where you can get it for free
when you buy other stuff
and this was free it's so good wish hey
didn't have to pay for the goody oh
what's this
twinkle lights well it's a bit late for
this now isn't it wish they sent me my
Christmas lights on the 23rd of December
Christmas lights
no it's actually not bad you know no
this could just spark can it be great
over here uh tonight I feel like wishes
actually just me won't you know my
Christmas weekend it was four pounds but
it's meant to be like stream lights and
yeah yeah sometimes I do think that the
the images are a little bit like a
little bit misleading but it's not a bad
product and it was four pounds
okay this is a big one I think I know
what I bought here this was 25 pounds
did I pay 25 after this I hope I didn't
this is a professional makeup organizer
travel case it's a professional makeup
travel case it does look kind of lip but
this looks more like a briefcase it's
very sturdy I'm not gonna lie it's you
know work very well formed hmm okay I
love the fact that it's got compartments
oh oh oh it's got this it is a treasure
trove that just keeps giving this is
really really nice actually really
really nice to makeup storage and like
taking it away it's actually a lot
bigger than I thought it was gonna be I
find this to be huge and I can imagine
by the time you fill it up with all the
makeup it's gonna be heavy and I love
having a really good sturdy makeup bag
like this but I wish it was a bit
smaller and cheaper for 25 pounds is a
lot but this is really good quality it's
really really sturdy I'm excited by that
okay what's in here there's two packages
together I just hope this isn't another
item of clothing because we've all
thought that the close in on the you're
so rude you're actually rude this dress
here is actually a hot mess it is crappy
material it's really low-quality it's
really thin it's really see through it
does not look like what it looks like in
the image and the reason why I bought
this is because I have a very similar
dress that I love and I thought this was
gonna look like that and it looks so it
looks so far from that
and it feels just awful but this is one
of those odds that you need to see on so
let's see what in a second I can't lift
it up it's more like a t-shirt right now
and everything is look like it was made
for a toddler I could tell as soon as I
took it out of the packet that this it
was just going to be skewed with like
look look at this I am one swoop away
from mooning you so I'm just gonna take
this dress off okay this is very round
oh it's a speed car oh oh it's cute
and it'll speak our outdoor Bluetooth
speaker let's see how good it is it
actually looks really good quality it's
really quite nice it's nice sometimes I
like to have a speaker that I attached
to my laptop because sometimes my laptop
doesn't output you know as loud as I
would like it to but I also thought this
would make like a nice little gift okay
so it's a wig it's a blonde wig it's a
20-pound wig
wow it's that kind of cute though I'm
gonna have to put a weak on my wig
because I'm just not dealing I stink
it really stinks it really stinks it
really stinks no one let me cut off the
lace because actually that's my bad you
know hold on hold on let's just lay this
I'm just gonna cut the lace and you guys
know I'm an avid week where oh why the
roots are jet-black I do not understand
this is not how you make a transition
sweetie it is actually doing the
uttermost
do you know what's crazy right
it isn't awful I think if someone was to
take the time to like customize the lace
from glue it down wear a hat on it it's
not the worst thing in the world if you
were like looking at changing your hair
color for a night then this is it's not
the worst thing in the world let me just
put a hat on yes I don't hate it I think
it's actually quite cute if I was ever
to just want to play and have some fun
with some color why not this is my
twenty pound wig I'm about to be a
Russian princess just call me a Nastasia
come on look at this Snow Queen Snow
Queen oh my gosh I love I'm loving this
I literally love this oh my gosh when I
want to go blonde I'm just gonna put my
19 pound wish wig on and just live my
best life obviously we need to cover
their hairline honestly I think with
this color to suit me as well I've been
fearful of the whole like blonde thing
for so long I have to share this on
snapchat like honestly my snapchat
friends are gonna be like yeah hold on I
want to see what Michael what do you
think what do I look like yeah it's
quite nice Danette Daenerys Targaryen
I'm so carried away and it's Christmas
I'm actually gonna do the rest of my
video in my synthetic wig tell me that
you don't think this wig is cute tell me
you don't you know filming videos is
long because it you end up getting
carried away I'm so carried away right
now you guys need to give me your name
you know what I haven't you look I need
a new name I need a new name right now
right let's see what else we have here
Oh what the hell is this Oh God another
gift that I bought for grace
[Laughter]
now that looks like a diamond
why does it look so white with a really
weird shape oh my who's that that's
that's a dick when they hey why are the
eyebrows orange oh hi
why is it so great why they turn out
shiny so basically there were dolls that
look like like real-life babies and I
thought okay let me get that that could
be quite cute not that Gracie's at the
age of playing with dolls yet for this
doll this doll our poor darling I'm so
sorry for laughing at you but your eyes
look like they have cataracts I can't
help but look at it quite closely like
sorry darling you're really great you
look really sick you know it's crazy I'm
going to love it actually kind of like
it now
I don't hate okay my disdain for it turn
to it's actually relatively cute it's
actually cute has it got a bunny but
it's got a belly button that looks like
a tiny penis
what is that why have they done that
what do they do this why do they do this
to the dolly why what is that tell me
that that doesn't look like a tiny penis
coming out of the stomach of the doll
why did they do this oh my god wish wish
you would never fail to amaze me oh this
is little cute little thing definitely
synthetic I just wanted a little gold
puff-puff-puff-puff
to put on bears or stuff like that it's
definitely synthetic because I know
there's some drama of actually you know
some stuff even though it says faux fur
is actually real fur and I do not
advocate that at all but you can kind of
tell like it's kind of hard and it
doesn't tape up it is fake but it's cute
I wanted something like this just to put
my little bags or something how much was
this this was another freebie
you know what they're not playing I
think you guys
search of free items on which and just
pay the shipping this is free crazy this
is quite dinky what's in here
I think I know what is yes so this is
one of these things ah yes so these are
one of these ring pools that you put on
the back of your phone but also it means
that you can kind of like balance it as
well this was free I've got so much free
stuff
yes wish okay hold on where's my phone
app so you put it on the back of your
phone oh it's not the exact colour but
it will do stick on the back of your
phone you have a nice ring pull at but
you also have something that you can
balance your phone and upwards so if I
want to do like something live and I
want to put my phone down it's able to
balance and this came free it's really
sturdy as well like this is a movie for
anyone wish you are the spot today has
been the day this has been Christmas
welcome to Patricia's Christmas sorry
but just a second guys do I not look
cute on my snapchat I just I just got to
say it like I feel really cute well you
know what you're allowed to tell
yourself that you look cute sometimes
there's nothing wrong with that I'm
having the best day right now I'm
getting kind of hot under this wig now
time ago okay we're back to the black
hair now last few packages are this is
cute is this a sweater is it a Christmas
sweater okay it's just the little knit
jumper I'm kind of shocked because it
looks really nice and it doesn't smell
and I'm looking I'm looking like there's
about to be something really bad on it
because the wish clothing has really
failed me but this is a nice little
jumper shop let's see what this looks
like on back on believe it I company
that's cute
this was five pounds and it looks like
the image shock horror amazing okay
let's get this on so guys this is the
jumper that I was surprisingly like
shocked by because it's actually really
nice unfortunately I put my hands in and
a
is quite sure but that isn't fried me
because it's such a nice jumper like
look how nice it is look at the detail
on that like look at it with these jeans
these are some River Island jeez I'll
bang in and just the top is actually
killing it I love the way that goes down
like this like I love it little
sweatshirt do you guys put a sweatshirt
I just call it a jumper but I don't
think in America you guys could a
jumpers but yeah look at this it's
really nice why it doesn't smell like
ass like it's really cute look at this
it is short though these Asian sizes are
real or my really long arms are just you
know you know my arms is just just not
made for normal clothing so it's fine so
we just you know we do the trick
but I think that's a genuinely really
nice jumper like genuinely honestly you
guys you have to see this up close how
good is this jumper like crazy I would
not expect this from wish Ellen that was
only 5 pounds but I've got more clothing
and it's looking like a mum's curtain
again it's just sequined and tasseled
and you know it's basically back to the
wish standard of just homemade it
literally looks homemade honestly like
someone just go excited and just glued
on some sequins onto some net curtain do
you know what I was like I'm not gonna
buy clothing on wish but I think
sometimes what happens is that you can
get a little bit carried away because
there's so much stuff and then it pops
up and you're like I'll just put that my
basket I just put that in my basket yeah
let's see what this looks like arms I
have a feeling it might look like kyon
but we'll see it's funny enough as a fit
as a fit it doesn't look awful right but
I have to stand like this because there
are sharp corners of sequins scratching
me all over there's no lighting or
anything you know it wouldn't have been
a bad Christmas all that party dress if
it was made you know in the with the ID
behind you need to be able to wear
clothing oh please be cute what is this
oh this was the first thing that I
wanted to purchase I wanted to purchase
a cute little look at this I just wanted
to get this like using a cool thing this
is a little unicorn onesie
they had adult sized ones as well I mean
it's a little shoddy but it isn't awful
and I think it's gonna look really
really cute on obviously this is it for
myself but this is a wish Christmas
present type of thing just wish
Christmas actually let me say so yeah
that is the bad this is one of those
also I've got to get Grace in it and
made me take a picture so you guys can
see okay guys that is me done there's
all the goodies that I got from wish and
I get it I get that people like you know
to to you know get bargains in that kind
of stuff but I am on the school of
thought of you do get what you pay for
but if you're willing to like try a
little bit you never know there might be
some gems I would not advise getting
clothing on which that's just my pure
piece of advice is don't bother doing it
there's any little trinkets that you
want to try out I've got a couple of
buck or quid or Euros available then I
don't see why not
just good thing is that I've always
received items even if they have taken
50 million weeks to arrive they always
end up coming and I'll be honest I am
too lazy to return stuff but to try not
but you can get returns as well I mean
I've got a little soft spot in my heart
for wish I probably won't do a wish
video next year so I wanted to end you
know the year with a little bit of
goodies Christmastime goodies from wish
and but yeah that's really it I hope you
guys enjoyed this video I'm actually
going to have a video hopefully on
Christmas Eve maybe the day after
Christmas and a few more before the end
of the year so make sure you have your
notifications on make sure you're
subscribed make sure you like make sure
you need comments I'm literally so
excited to like the year to come I
cannot wait get away okay guys thank you
