video is basically the beginning of my
back to school series and I know that a
lot of people going to college for the
first time or to university or just
going back I want to start the term or
the school year fresh and new and
startling you know I'd say today's it is
going to be kind of like a
back-to-school lookbook or five looks
for school and I thought to myself these
are great looks that you could basically
we're all one week and then mix it up
for the next week and then mix it up for
the week after and stuff like that so I
hope it's going to be really helpful and
I'm thinking like Scott the school is
obviously not about fashion or about
clothing I don't know I might do a video
of encouragement so for those of you who
might be feeling a bit nervous or just
want a bit of insight into
back-to-school then let me know if you
want to do something like that or I can
do my college story or my university
story or I can do them oh I'm not really
sure so let me know but I'll stop
rambling and letting you enjoy this
video and good luck of you guys getting
ready to go back to school don't feel
nervous just go in there feeling like
yes I can do this so thanks for watching
guys bye okay guys so here's the first
look it's literally just a throw on
pullover dress I'm just going to use a
belt to make it have a bit more shape I
just throw on another jacket like this
and I'm just wearing it with these boots
and the tights are like if it's
basically a little bit chilly where you
are if you don't like showing too much
leg then I think tights are a good idea
and a satchel bag like that really
really easy I'm not gonna accessorize
they're just don't wanna do too much for
this look and it's get you really simple
look
so guys this is the next look and it's
my favorite look and all I'm doing is
wearing that denim shirt and a black
skirt this is a racer skirt so it's kind
of round but denim shirts you can find
everywhere but I'll put a link in the
description box to every single outfit
I think the shirts are really good when
they are buttoned up to the very top and
then you add a bit of accessory or
jewelry like I am here so for those who
want to have a bit of height for school
but don't want to look like I'm wearing
stilettos the flat form or just like
some low wedges are a really good idea
so for the bad look I like to add a
backpack I think it's really cool really
quality but I think as a girl it looks a
bit odd or it looks a bit too trying too
hard when you wear it but both sleeves
so I like to wear just one once they let
it drape kind of almost like it's a
handbag so though this is my third look
and basically what we incorporated our
autumn colors so aubergine maroon is
like my favorite color for autumn and I
got really excited and it's a round neck
jumper that's another thing that's my
favorite like keeping up here or covered
no just a jumper I've got on and then
like a choke art and it goes just to add
a bit of pizzazz to the outfit and plain
black jeans as a jacket and love body
warm is right now especially quilted
ones they just add some common I think
green and aubergine go really well
they're really well together right now
so Footwear like Tennessee shoe pump
type things you can get the moves of
different colors I like it when they've
got the white sole that would definitely
die then I would just add the same bag
I'm Adam
so literally five days at college you
don't need to work more than three bags
a week to college in my opinion hey guys
so here is the next look and it's
basically just another jump off sweater
look but this is more of a back being
kind of drapey sweater so I quite like
this college or like a casual day out it
looks really nice and then if you put it
on with a pair of really really skinny
and slightly cropped jeans oh yeah
really really skinny jeans and I really
like that kind of cropped and cool look
so I just like followed my jeans up at
the bottom and these are getting another
pair of kind of tennis converse type
shoes these are kids and I bought these
ones because they're leather I love
these ones if you're not really into
wearing color but you want to a touches
of color then speckle looks really good
this is a speckle jumper from Topshop
and I don't if you can see but their
touches of yellow and pink blue and
everything inside it it's absolutely
gorgeous and it's mesh so this look is
another easy breezy casual look the
backpack looks quite nice with it as
well I think it's
at collegiate and just a little bit of a
tiny jewelry I love really little bits
of jewelry as well at the moment say yes
okay guys so this is my final duck and
it's basically the short look sound
girls like to wear shorts to college I
remember when I was at university I'd
see girls wearing shorts in snow it's
snowing and ghazal still growing denim
shorts I'm not gonna do that but you
know leather shorts are great they're
fairly warm and I think whether in black
tights it look quite cool and on top I'm
just wearing a white shirt buttoned up
to the top and my shirts got a bit of
detailing so my favourite type of shoes
are ballet pumps they are so easy to
wear and just throw them on with
absolutely and then just an oncology as
well just to make me look like I've got
some sense if it's cold and these were
cardigan
okay guys so that is my final outfit and
I hope to enjoy this video so see you
later guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
