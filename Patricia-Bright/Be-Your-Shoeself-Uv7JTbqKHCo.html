thought I would do a shoe collection
video because I've been asked about this
however when I was kind of putting it
together I realized that you know my
shoes brought back a lot of memories and
I thought I maybe go through them with
you as well so I'll show you my shirt my
shoes as well as tell you a few of the
stories behind some of them as well I
hope it's not too cheesy and I hope you
enjoy bye
okay guys so this is my first pair these
are from office these are my recent pair
of shoes and you guys have been asking
me loads and loads about them they're
platform
floral shoe and I bought them for 52
pounds but they've actually gone down to
37 pounds for anyone who was interested
in getting them they're from office and
you know all my new these are my recent
purchases they don't have that many
stories behind them yet but maybe I
could say that these a friend of mine
had them I was like oh my god I've got
to get those so you guys are probably
just seen these in my whole video and/or
are going to see them in a whole video
but these are my really sexy kind of
gladiator high heels and usually I hate
thin Hills but hmm these aren't too bad
so next they're my shoes
oh these so these shoes are also
purchased when I bought these shoes here
these are 20 pounds from office as well
so here I have more all those shoes
these are the curb black what's cool a
black ankle boot with a lovely bit of
stretch I thought these are really cool
really really kind of almost French
looking and they've got a platform and a
thick heel my favorite and I bought
those at Christmas
along with these and these you guys must
remember and I dunno shoe haul so these
are these gorgeous wedges that will be
going away with me on holiday they're
going to be so comfortable it can't wait
it's got the lovely nose the tassel
there as well and these are also kind of
a high-heeled loafer clearly you'll see
there's a trend
I do love my tan I do love my platform
and I do love my thick heel that's me
all over so these are recent purchases
as you can see these from where they
from Primark these are holiday shoes I
like them because they've got the rubber
base as well so it'll be really
comfortable and these are like the most
colorful shoes I own I really don't wear
colorful shoes at all but that keep
their very holiday ish I've also got
these sandals which are really cute and
they've got the gold detailing along
there these are from Primark as well
these are twelve pounds and they are
leather and these are from Urban
Outfitters actually and I found them in
the sale section they're really cute
because it's got this lace up detail
here the little cuts on the side are
really cute and they're kind of open
toward the back and they actually have
got a minor heel as well very very
comfortable I love them so here we are
with the shoes with more of a story
behind them and the shoes that I kind of
like the more of the history so these
are my wedged ankle boots in a black
suede and these are from Zara and I
remember when I got them basically I was
on the train on in Oxford Circus or
going to accessories and that's all this
gorgeous fabulous looking girl and she
had them on I said oh my god I love
these shoes were they braum and she's oh
they're from Zara literally I got off
the train I went to Zara I hope what the
shoes and that's how compulsive or
impulsive I can be at times so these
shoes yeah they look disgusting right
they do look disgusting they're a black
flat patent sandal which I bought from
primark years ago but I love them
because these have been to Portugal with
me they've been to New York to me with
me and they've been to Rome with me so
these are very much my traveling sandals
and they will be coming to Asia of me I
might try and wear these on every
continent in the world and just to say
that they've done that so I love these
because they remind me of the good times
that I've had in other countries so
these boots are like my rough my rough
and ready boots you know that can you
see the lovely lovely studying on them
it's got this really cute studying they
kind of look a bit cowboy a bit slouchy
I have no idea what no idea where I
bought them from I can't remember for
the life of me but I just love them
because they were the first kind of
Rocky boots I wore and my sister wears
stuff like that a lot more and we both
had kind of matching boots that we felt
really cool with them and I still love
them a lot even now so these are my
platform Topshop shoes with a really
wooden edge a wooden wedge these are
really cool they're not the most
comfortable pair of shoes but I do love
them and I love these because they
remind me out that my nights out in
London you know when I wasn't working
I'm employed I'm just going out you know
don't do that people don't just go out
but and I was going out with my lovely
friend Laura J we're spending in a lot
of time of the London scene and those
shoes and also these shoes here spent a
lot of time going out with me so you
guys should remember these shoes which I
really loved
very similar maybe I was going for a
phase kind of look like these boots but
in a high heel form kind of went up like
this studying all a nap around and he
imagined them with these kind of with
this outfit amazing and also these shoes
which are actually really ugly now that
I look at
as you know they're not that ugly we can
kind of see him like ankle boots and I
do like my high heels and I do like my
platforms and these spend a lot of time
on the street in the streets know these
I spent a lot of time here when I was
going out alone so finally I have like
that all these over here like the really
old old shoes and I love these boots
these boots I bought from Primark again
and these I've had since 2008 and they
were real leather off there were 30
pounds and I thought to myself oh my
gosh that's a lot of money to be
spending on boots in in Primark but they
oh my gosh when it was raining in
Manchester I just used to throw these on
so comfortable so warm throughout winter
whatever I still wear them wear them all
the time even now so these are something
I will always cherish
thank you Primark okay so these boots
which don't get as much love as they
used to these boots really don't get
that much anymore good but they're not
really what I'm into that much anymore
but I love them and I do bring them out
you know on occasion in winter and these
are like the first pair of boots that
Michael bought me they're from Topshop
back in 2000 2008 as well and I just
loved the color and my friend my friend
had the black pair in the ankle boots
and I was like I'm gonna go get the over
knee pair Michaels a fool here
yeah and they were from Topshop at the
time they were 120 pounds but I think we
bought them for 78 finally these are
like my club shoes in Manchester imagine
literally disgusting they are alder
though most of my shoes are outer office
primer huh these are Aldo they're you
know slingback Payton and I used to wear
these all the time in Manchester just
any dress these shoes and
these shoes and they were also something
that might brought me as well back in
the day you know and these 70 Queen King
am i doing 70 pounds well oh well I've
got an issue I don't even know where got
them here they're disgusting
it just steep but these are like one of
the first hit was I started wearing
where did I buy them from no ID and then
kind of ankle boot is in but no they're
just not comfortable they're horrible
in my trademark brand I also could only
find one of these here but I still for
I'll show you anyway
somewhere and these are like mine I
actually bought these last year from
Aldo and I was like oh these are gonna
be my work shoes my work shoes I was
gonna wear these in an office every
single day Patricia
are you crazy but I did take them out to
New York with me and I remember because
obviously we did all of our training in
in a hotel yeah we did training in a
hotel a fabulous hotel and I kind of
come tottering down the stairs and these
high heels my feet will be her to me and
by lunchtime I'll go back up to my room
and take them off and come down in like
a pair of flat shoes with like a suit or
like sandals as well so yeah that's what
I put these here and to be honest
they've only been in the office from
four times ever so these are 80 quid as
well always somebody but guys that is my
shoe collection and I hoped you liked it
and I hope that the stories were not too
cheesy or anything and it went too long
you could fast-forward through me
talking because I know I talk a lot but
yeah this is my shoes
hope you like them as much as I do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
