video today on wearing black and wearing
white because I found that really the
majority of my wardrobe is either black
or is either white and these are the
basic neutrals that everyone always
wears and sometimes you're like oh I
should put some color in blah blah blah
but I don't feel like you need to you
can just add pops of colors with your
outfit so I'll show you that outfit that
I'm wearing today and just how it's all
black and what I do to add a bit of
brightness to it so here's the outfit
I'm wearing and I'm wearing this on top
which is from american apparel which
i've had babies it's kind of see-through
not wearing anything on the inside but
you can't see that much and just a black
pencil skirt just mention him and this
flat belt which i bought from singapore
and the thing is is that i am wearing
all black so I've added like a bit of
jewelry which is from German from ages
ago which it has a touch of color on it
and then I would wear a collared
cardigan get right on with the cardigan
you can see how it really makes the
outfit look really bright and just even
though wearing all black I just look
really bright really shine it and I
could also wear like another bright
color like my red blazer oh here's the
outfit with the red blazer it's like
bright are and just look like since my
blazer which is from zara you can see
what this looks like it just makes it up
little Philip right up the next up will
show you how I leave a like an all-white
outfit all right way ok this is my all
white dress which is from one key and it
the thing about this is that it's got
legs so it adds a bit of color and
everything too well my color underneath
like oh I'm coming up a bit but it's a
lace dress and just add some accessories
as well because it is quite designed its
laces textured I don't like putting too
much with it and I still have the ankle
boots on where I think that just adds a
bit of edginess to really baby doll
white dress that can look a bit too
girly for my kin but it's really really
pretty but this and it's worth you're
wearing worldwide and wearing red
lipstick which was really really
with with the infrared just adds a bit
of pizzazz to it and I'll show you what
it looks like with a denim jacket voila
so I really like white and denim
together because I think it looks kind
of like what does it look I don't know
it looks kind of something or the other
that looks really nice about just
thinking that's cool and this jacket is
like 10 years old I bought this when i
was 16 i still wear it yes oh I think
it's kind of yellowish probably it needs
to be a bit more distress but like denim
shorts and denim jackets I'm like
everywhere right now so this is how I
wear black white I hope to know that
video bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
