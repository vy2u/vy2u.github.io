the most requested videos which is the
mic does my makeup and Mike looks a
little bit different right now because
June's given with reason why I'm growing
a moustache what messenger moustache was
for charity so no mean comments yeah do
we like it with Natasha I like you with
the Tash he looks quite suave and
sophisticated a little bit kind of
French no no no but it's all for charity
for Movember so leave off with me in
comments yeah thank you
okay so we're gonna get started and
Mike's going to do my makeup so I have
no makeup on right now I want to show
you guys the setup complete I basically
put everything out for him so he can
just go ahead and do that easily got who
well he got here
no idea Russia's coloring coloring
mascara says on the book on the ball
this is have some foundation powder know
that so just so you know I have no clue
this is disclaimer I have no clue when
it comes to makeup I know Patricia likes
it and enjoys taking time and doing
these things for putting videos out for
everyone well in all honesty I've
absolutely no clue what I'm doing so
this is literally I know the idea is I
hold on for your entertainment but when
the end product comes out if it's pretty
horrific then don't take it to heart
because it's just done for entertainment
purposes I know it'd make me look
beautiful
I'll try but I don't know what I'm gonna
clear what it what I'm doing
participants it they're watching her put
makeup on it and why would I know about
it I just don't okay not aunty well I'm
anti makeup - no I'm just saying I'm a
little pro you'd a little bit of an
introduction okay so basically I'm not
auntie it but I don't necessarily think
it should be slathered on all over the
place and we've already talked about
that anyway so should I go ahead and
start go ahead
okay so first thing that you want to do
when you put your makeup on I think is
for like a foundation layer on here like
a base coat kind of
so I think this one is going to be one
of these two it's maybe one of these two
brushes that you put it on with and I
don't know which one but I don't know I
will go with this one clicks got an
orange bit at the top so how orange Oh
Brown bit so you just want to put it in
there yeah I think and then go ahead and
start brushing on you put it on you okay
yeah sorry tell me your eyes close my
eyes in you're playing it to my forehead
there it goes
I don't know you should put it on a bit
arm just get a bit of a couple on
layering round
so that's your base coat how's it look
on the you can't see but anyway so make
sure you don't get in the eyes don't
poke the eyes yeah - I see oh mac studio
fine foundation brush Mac Studio Fix
okay next thing will go for maybe the
eyes so there's a few little pencils
down here and I just have got no idea
what I'm doing here
so this one says eyeliner so that's
going to go and I want to do something
for the eyebrows first I think go from
the top and work down and I said sounds
like a logical order to me so any of
these we got some things about me for
colour in Europe because you put
something I want here sometimes don't
you help me out come on which one goes
in your eyebrows there's so many
different things here well I hate poster
no Mike those are lipsticks I know they
don't go on glitter coloring here what
are this one no that could be okay do
you think that could go my eyebrows what
does it say crayon year something for
the eyes at French your waterproof brink
so you want to read the fret that could
be for the eyebrows that bit there that
said coach give that try eyeliner pencil
that won't go from the actual a little
bit filled over here okay do you wanna
show this is not right this is gonna
show them what you're using is that
right tell me that surely you can use
this on my eyebrows but I would suggest
putting color on my eyebrows before you
stop just brushing them okay so what
I'll put the color on with the other set
different specs okay carefully so we use
in this one go look at that she probably
can't could completely out of focus for
anyway it's pencil of some to the right
it's not coming oh sorry
maybe that really hurts
well it's not coming off is it you
either sharpener or something okay yeah
do even come out it does Michael you're
probably painting it on trying to get it
on breath not coming it is on okay oh
yeah bit darker records I'm sorry it's
okay should have color in there let
maybe use this end to kind of dulled it
around gals it might dousing flames okay
excelente so that's that bit done then
we come down to the eyes so need a
pencil for that and I'll add a pencil
and that's what I want so I've got a
sleek Kohl eyeliner pencil saying focus
or not probably not is it okay never
mind
sweet focused pencil so I'm going to try
and put a bit of line around here do you
think on the top but yeah this isn't it
I'm going to try and do some like twisty
bits at the end some people like though
isn't it so baby am I going too close
what's up moving living and with it
something even what's a matter
alright is it i doing it wrong tell me
from doing it one local stop
you wanted to do this video yeah you
asking me to this dumb video then you
wants to sell for two second trying to
put your eyeliner on that's way too much
I've gone over the edge
awesome comeback
that's gone too far
stop it stop it Sam if you weren't
moving around so much
I've gone way too deep oh I got black
guy now
I need him punished in the face so I
stopped it I said we need some cleaner
of Buddhism so tissues look I can see
popping oh my god what have I done
listen I need something to wipe this off
here that's that
why could you just line it on the inside
of the eyes not Rama what you mean just
underneath the island no baby don't
worry don't worry about this theme
eyeliner up and what not off cuz it's
gonna look a mess yeah I can't look in
there just to hold on we're just gonna
I'm gonna show you what we got going on
and then I'm gonna work it off there
went a bit overboard with the coloring
okay you gotta be gentle it's my eyes
sweetheart be on top okay are you happy
with it I don't know what you do okay
try again this is torture Gilly guys
freak my good ya know it's meant to be
like this
what bit is it meant to be really dark
um me I just ask you just a question
take out my eye stop anything it I'm
gonna forget the eyeliner because that's
just awkward it's easy to do it yourself
when someone else is doing it you can't
call you but you said you're gonna
forget yeah I want to try again
something moving
this is the first time I've ever put
makeup on anyone in my whole life so I
end the day think back to when you were
a little kid and you did it for the
first time and it was a bit of a sale
that's what this is going to be like
what do I need to do now eyelash a
mascara
what about colors are my eyes or
anything oh yeah okay uh what should we
go for today well looks good idea what
color looks good anew like a pink pepper
tightening try that it's gonna be one of
these ones isn't it is this the right
one tell me yeah hmm see you know all
these don't use dark purple me like that
one I try that one
why don't we go for gold so you go wear
this out the house gold on your eye okay
I want way too much eye on the camera go
there this dick
not going to top up the brush what
weights absolutely not for a minute I
put way too much time look you can just
you it comes off quite rightly so
ok dental this is like Halloween gone
wrong why did you tell you about gold is
oh look at that
anyway moving on the mascara or do I put
mascara room with need that push the
kingdom is there something here but most
power on see this is done because people
are gonna watch this I think oh I can't
believe he doesn't know what I've never
in my life okay so where's the mass
Carla
alright oh yeah one that says mascara
yeah okay I'll be the one I'm smashing
out okay you got Troy you guys please
oh it's painful it's just doing nothing
so glad I'm not woman with the worst
thing to have to do this okay so that's
made virtually no difference at all how
do you know it's lovely
are you taking the meat how it's not
working it's working it's fine I'm not
trying I'm trying and failing miserably
okay uh the other things that I hate
blusher yeah okay blush is going to go
on with this brush here chunky on making
a bit of a mess so we've got some
blusher here which is a pink blusher I'm
going to pop with a brush that's a bit
on the end
don't like doing this this is just
really out of my comfort zone
so what you'll be an expert soon I'll
teach you so far out my comfort zone
just like lovely see it's bringing up my
face it's way too orange looks Lee look
like you've been shot in the face this
is it it's an experiment gone wrong okay

me I only got gold over here you've got
gold lipstick okay go for this one here

it's fine this is no this is a freak
show this is a literal freak show it's
awful attempt so I'm just gonna um I did
not know time basically right so this is
this is an attempt okay
I know it's rubbish I don't know that
it's a this absolutely no the only
lesson to be learnt from today don't let
somebody hasn't got to and has no
interest not no interest but no
knowledge of make away okay yeah so as
you can see I'm no professional in this
game and I tried but this is really for
entertainment purposes so we're getting
