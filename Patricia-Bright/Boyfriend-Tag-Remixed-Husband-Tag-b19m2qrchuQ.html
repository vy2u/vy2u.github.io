perfectly - yeah so yeah we're going to
do the husband tag we're on vacation
right now this probably will get up got
Wilma back Cobra before Mike has got a
bit of a tan right now he wanted to show
his tag he's like Flugtag me on
YouTube is such a life you just make up
crap stories the time keep everyone
entertained Oh a position was like Mike
and where you doing put on this a video
that's his how it makes stuff up I did
make now I can fun okay good Amy hey
we're going to address the boyfriend tag
questions nothing is we found one that
he's not saying boyfriend I say the
husband
sorry the husband I crushed it I go
through all that hassle Peter
call me your boyfriend okay husband that
first and a hassle that wonderful happy
process Oh Mary hmm okay so we found
there are 30 questions 30 there's 30
questions and this one was it but yeah
30 so woodruf yeah these were kind of
similar to their boyfriend one yeah no
but there's no such thing as a husband
tag it's the boyfriend tag revisit let's
make one well what join them at what I
would you say let's make one now no no
they go this question will know this
right fine I'm gonna turn this off while
we come up with so-called shipping gonna
make some more make some more question
big attack I'll make the tag off as you
do this yeah I create your own Terry
your own tag like in the movie Brad is
loving it okay so we've come up with a
few questions just on the spot to deal
with this so we can both answer these so
what's the best thing about being
married Michael okay the best thing
about being married is that you get to
know
together all the time well that's why I
says it I said I was gonna say okay okay
yeah we get to as I say I get to see you
all the time and come home to you and
yeah that's right that's right yeah yeah
that's like when I get you know nothing
like mmm-hmm yeah that's the best thing
okay what do you think about weddings
and the whole wedding process I think is
I think it is the whole wedding process
and the whole flattening is good
actually
I know people some people say oh it's
just a ceremony doesn't mean anything
blah blah blah but I think there's a lot
of value in having big getting married
and having your friends and people you
care about around there to be together
and celebrate with you it's worth doing
it's a bit expensive though and there's
ways of making it a bit cheaper ways on
the whole it's going to be kind of
expensive but yes but if you can manage
it it's fun what did you enjoy the most
about your wedding
oh I enjoy the party with my friends and
what I enjoy most the end bit the going
home baby yeah I enjoyed yeah I enjoyed
that
and dancing for everyone that was cool I
hated that with everybody
just check it out my moves oh yes no
Michael I didn't like dumb yeah and what
what is different after being married I
think for us because we didn't live
together just being together the whole
time is different because it's quite a
bit more intense you say like I said
yeah that sounds bad I don't mean in
this really bad way but it's a lot more
we're together all the time now whereas
before obviously not during the day at
work but you know a lot more that's
amazing we do spend a lot more time
together which is a good thing and also
there's a lot more if it has to be a lot
more compromise because you're together
oh yeah and you have to really consider
your other person differently if I'm
gonna go out you know
I need to like Oh Mike I'm going out or
think I'd be home at this time and they
must call just to make sure Mike knows
where I am and vice-versa so there's a
lot you don't know you're in trouble big
trouble
thank you and I might get angry so we
got a new idea so Allah thank you got it
what's the favorite thing about your
wife it's very concentrated wife focused
yeah I'm gonna say MacGregor I think my
wife oh there's too many to answer we
need a whole video on that green house
is the lazy man's answer I was a bit
yeah favorite thing about my wife is um
just good fun to be with all right can
be sometimes not so fun I think you like
me most and I'm asleep not talking
everything about me gone I don't know no
folk thing about Michael is also the
mindless annoying thing about Michael
which is basically Michael is extremely
extremely persistent and we call him
push it or icon and push it to the limit
because Michael if she won't give up he
does not give up on anything which is
good you know when times are you need
someone who knows not how to give up but
dr. Owen Ethan then when it's time to
let it go he'll accept defeat
then he can accept defeat never which is
quite good yeah let's move on to these
questions now let's do this quick fire
round
get your seats making a funny noise
people are sleeping fighting okay yes
farting okay right where do we meet we
met in Manchester one night I was
working you're out with a friend
partying and me and my friend gave you
guys a lift on what was our first date
our first date was going out
we went out to play pool oh my god I
just remembered my outfit
we had I will I've put loads of effort
or what I was gonna wear because it was
like the first day thinking okay I'm
gonna make a good impression and she
never said anything at the time it went
okay and then a few years later I
thought we were talking about it and she
said I hated half it
that was awful those chains are
disgusting coffee three trousers and a
 eat green light and matching a
matching suit you're not in the army
with a yellow t-shirt no you know that
looked good hey-oh
and it worked cuz we got married sir
anyway well we didn't get rid because of
that outfit I literally had to revamp
your whole wardrobe or lack of it that's
a lie it's true
did you know that I was the one well on
our first date mm pretty mean in here
because I do now yeah I know yes the
moment I saw you the room just they did
away no I didn't know you're the one a
first impression
president pressure wasn't that great
actually but this America you know then
what was your first impression my first
impression with you a bit noisy a bit
loud well I didn't know your character
then so just with you a bit noise in
loud but fun okay final do you have a
tradition not really could take each
inning because this girl is obsessed
with eating specifically things that
involve meat and seafood and fish and
prawn energy and even she's not hungry
she would just like make a beeline
towards any restaurant or food outlet or
supermarket I didn't
the menus that I like mmm so our
tradition is going to restaurants
normally me progressively purchase your
wide-eyed long arm stretching for all
the fees and one of these days is gonna
start showing wellness no I think it's
absolute miracle amazing that she's not
huge but I like eating okay and eating
is our tradition and Michael makes a
mean stuff right now high five high five
Michael didn't used to cook but since he
become a husband he's cooked high five
yeah good times
what's our first road trip Liverpool uh
what do we argue about the most you know
uh nothing the most anymore we used to I
don't argue about time because we see
travel all the time I'm in love that's a
bonus it emo bonus yeah I get to see you
all the time I think on a very break
yeah going right into the Jim Bob who
wears the pants in the relationship I
should say I wear the pants by thought
it might wear the pants a little bit
more enough it depends what we're
talking about yeah exactly if it's the
parenting fashion then I wear the pants
and going to restaurants and stuff then
I wear the pants but if it's like let's
get somewhere and how do we get there
Mike wears the pants if it's a money
thing there's many things Michael wears
the pants oh yeah if it's like let's
make a big decision I don't want to make
any decisions I leave that to Mike okay
if you're sitting in from the TV what
are you watching I would say you don't
actually watch much TV you're more
likely to be sat in front of the
computer watching watching some form of
YouTube tutorial or video or vlog or
poor or something like that we go out to
eat what do I get to drink not much of
it not really much of an alcohol drink
no olive
we tried that where we fail I try to do
hey oh let's check if drinking it right
fail we don't drink it's really maybe
something just like a apple juice
apple juice or Fanta I think I'm it sir
that's how we go down sideways so an
embarrassment oh my gosh yet what size
shoe do I wear no are you allowed to say
there will you know seven is it bigger
than second half yeah that's it yeah
yeah first collecting anything what
would it be collecting um I can probably
think of something like jewelry no you
have any collections really I'm
developing a collection Oh mad perfume
okay something bags bags have backed an
expensive ones that we don't need that I
mean what would I eat every day if I
could
hmm meat what's my favorite cereal
chicken probably yeah that's true gotta
fry some chicken what's my favorite
cereal crunching up conflicts yeah I do
like crunchy not what's my favorite
music um normally some sort of soul R&amp;amp;B
and gospel what's her favorite sports
team fail nah he knows I'm sitting
nothing about sports okay what's my eye
color dark brown very dark brown yeah
who's my best friend um I see your
sister yeah whatever you think it's
gonna say me but then I thought it's not

Aker you're good cook no but you bake me
