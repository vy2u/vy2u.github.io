and boy boy boy do ish hit the fan it
hit the fan so hard and we were about to
revisit touch another one we're
revisiting fashion over and we're
revisiting it really really hard so you
guys are no doubt I get a fascinating
video probably that six six maybe
several weeks ago and what had happen I
didn't know much about the website I see
it as everybody's you know everybody
else Instagram their mom net on the door
everybody is wearing fashionable and I
was absolutely computer but who are
these guys in residence where they would
live my feet the video of Congress
website evite and of somehow the CEO and
team at fashion over happens a attach
the video Amelia and I'm going to be
totally honest it'd be guys although I
was acting a little bit dramatic
they were extremely extremely gracious
so basically the CEO at fashion over as
the team emailed me like a mature so
like oh there whatever I've done you
never know how it's gonna go but they
been think we'll actually like we
appreciate your constructive criticism
and what you have to say about fashion
over and they thought that I was invited
so that I gave an honest and kind of
clear opinion I wasn't swayed one way or
the other and you know for me being
honest is the best policy but you know
they have to disease a bit there that
was a bit like although this is so
awkward however they were very nice
about it so we don't know I was in LA
and you will know now if you see my last
blog of anime and I ended up
in too many regards our passion a virus
because I wasn't saying that they are
HIV website which they are I feel very
bad because I thought idea trying to
like put aside people's businesses or
anything I just want to give you guys
the real key when it comes to what
clothing is out there so actually I can
say that they are in LA business and to
have seven stores
I believe alone seven stores five to
seven stores that have been around
action for I think it was about seven
years and then they moved online in the
last couple of years and have blue own
heart slope and actually they do pride
ourselves in the quality of their
clothing and they're like not a Chinese
website they were not the same she and
we're not just bystanders wrongly so I'm
sorry I've got it right I got it wrong I
didn't know that I don't even knew that
let me know in the comments so they're
really nice a went into light there and
warehouse to see like their production
facility but it's a genuine show
lighting isn't you know as scary as I
thought it was gonna be basically you
know a lot of people saying that they
haven't received their orders my advice
was diversity with this what's happened
to me book orders and then they
basically favor
they've been grown so far they've
updated their website and there's some
technical changes going on but they have
sorted it so they have a backlog of
orders and processing and custom emails
that they haven't got from and they put
their hands up and said they just were
not prepared for how fast is it growing
and they're sorting out now so I'm
hoping at this point in time it is sort
it and the girls bodies are not
photoshopped
this is bad you know we are set like
Alice I was relying on Photoshop it is
because I love awesome up set up in that
Coast coca-cola body however there a
particular model her body is looking
that way
now whether if she's born of it maybe
it's amazing lean and don't know however
that's what I would look like in more
lies
and so beyond it nowadays a lot of
people in the states do have these
bodies that are shaped this way and so
they are quite particular in the kind of
mode
that they pick for they pick the girls
with that really curly shape and I know
there are tons of two completely and
utterly appreciate that like seeing
gauze or you know this thicker a little
bit of curbs and the big hips or
whatever because some people felt like
being you know never had anything that
catered to them that buy and then you
know people like me worship backup tooth
we're just hoping for no more to shape
models to come in to you know being
fashionable and feel like there may be
one being a trend no I don't actually
numbers again and when it comes to
celebrity endorsements I mean they seem
to know absolutely everyone that
everybody seems to know them and I don't
know whether there's some kind of
partnerships or their honor I didn't
really get clarification on that but I
think we all kind of know there's
different some kind of partnerships
going on between people and there ain't
nothing wrong with that I never shut
that down buzzing what we all want to
know is that will on is true was the tea
on the clothing to be honest even if
someone you know even if I do get
contacted by a CEO or a company the
whole point is that I give an impartial
view on a brand or a website and partly
vote or I need to be a little bit more
careful because people are watching this
but part of me is like most I'm gonna
tell it our is so we're about to do it
and I have got bags of clothing from
fashion over I'll be honest abused they
were like pick anything you want on the
backside basically sat down and got
comfortable my cup of tea as it's a
bunch of stuff so I'm going to show you
what I've got and we're going to review
fashionable tips so we are getting this
very strict this dress here all this on
the website and I thought okay I'm on my
life I felt like I have seen it before
and I have seen wow this dress is heavy
fitted aside small and it's 109 dollars
but I think if I check on the website
exactly fifty five dollars now so it's
gone down in price and you know what's
crazy
I wanted this dress last year or similar
dress today on how to C be and I
couldn't get it because to get so now
I'd like this to be the exact same dress
hmm oh wow I always feel like I've got a
Photoshop body yeah I think my business
like sagging any of it but I'm being
smashed all here I don't think other
with my colour but that is this right
the point this is a very thick material
dress very very thick it fits very very
well it's really nice
I can't new past vistas but it's a
really nice dress true or false but but
this is definitely it's not the exact
same dress extremely similar to a dress
that I wanted last year it's kind of
like similar to Balmain and similar to
how to see be the quality is nicer like
it is nice it's very thick
I'm not mad you know to be honest this
looks expensive
boonie okay off to a good start
okay this is a buttoned down kind of NIC
style dress still mine it's like a thick
cotton seems like a thick cotton so I
small visit $27.99 nicely it's curious
alright will you listen and it's nice
my only issue is that the buttons are
very shiny and normally when I've got
buttons that are too shiny it just has a
little a little bit of a a cheap look to
it so usually don't go for really really
gold buttons are really large like this
but but it's nice it fits nicely I'm not
angry at that at all okay so this dress
is called for your needs very similar
actually different this one is ripped
this one given rid this is $24.99 now
this dress makes me look like I'm
actually 7 months pregnant
Mac I'm not feeling that I mean if you
are completely snatched without a lump
or bump this is going to look
going to knew how they or not you're
potentially going to look like you are
with child or extremely bloated like you
know that much friendly it will come all
of the way through and it will just be
shaming we have time is to those imagine
foldable stomach contract that but that

them they're like sparkly they fit very
nicely these are a thicker pair of denim
and they've got really nice stretch in
them
obviously if you're 2002's more than
they're not going to fit but I would buy
these
I would definitely potentially try and
get an exchange the chemo jeans these
are the Alessa red jeans also a size
through it I don't know what it was but
that other pair was so damn tight they
didn't fit at all these are way better
yeah these look good they're not good
I picked up this this is the mini leaf

for me you know what it's just gathering
up my fanny you can get you see a V is
vagina ring saying hi vagina

like a chameleon hiding in the forest

need the print here it's not for me it
is not as a no for me for someone this
is a solemn invite you know if you go to
a beach party II and you know you want
to blend in with the palm trees so
you're just going to be like we say
funny to the wind through this it's so
ways I feel like I keep picking stuff up
that is the same material this is a
floral dress it's looking very strong
it's looking very floral because the
walk in the garden dress and it is 32 99
I was thinking it was about to do a
month curtain it was about to do a month
curtain until the mesh up here started
to come through the flowers are a bit
large come on
but I wish the flowers I love the top I
love the top of this dress I love the
fit but the flowers are huge this is a
dresser you have to be very confident of
yourself to walk in like if you walk in
in a dress like this you're like hi I've
arrived many pop in has entered the
golden little floral pop in Instagram
stars of 10 today I can't remember do it
over there cut I'm breaking your blimp
Rome this is the neon T in black $17.99
on and I'm going to try it on with some
jeans these are the perfectly classic
jeans they're $39.99 they have a tag
that says made in America
so I can see my kneecap novels in this
out to me acting that the denims our
little sin took because again I'm seeing
my knee pad mobile that you can really
see my knee cast just coming through to
say hello but the soir if you're someone
who needs a lot of stretching Eugene
these are these are stretchy jeans these
are very stretchy you are like my
husband and you do aerobics in jeans yes
but I like my jeans a little thicker the
t-shirt is just it's just the t-shirt is
$17 okay for a t-shirt I mean it's all
relative for me it's okay but it's a
nice car if anything it isn't too long a
tee and it is it too shorty all right at
all my brother all right the next is the
next flicks and chill sets but 34
dollars for just chilling no honey this
needs to be coming outside of me all
right yes I love the shape of the tee
it's cropped though it is cropped it
looks like a proper casual set but you
in looks like you could also go to bed
with it and this gives me like the
illusion of a flatter stomach it fits
well it's very good seamless again you
know I've got my sick panties and
grandma's phone today and you can't see
it so there's something very casual I
would be more about the 20 pounds mark
so last jeans this is a Donatella zipper
jeans
$34.99 these are these are more up my
street these actually feels thicker than
the classic pair and they've got the
stretch not as stretchy but they've got
the stretch but have a thicker denim
feel this is called the sign your name T
sub in it I don't like the material it's
just a cotton thing illness too though
it looks cute but it does it feel like
amazing how much is it 20 to 22 dollars
that is $22 but these are beautiful Wow
this this is a look this is very
Patricia this is a Patricia Monday to
Thursday these jeans are
killer they're awesome no these jeans
that rude because they're actually
awesome no look look I'm not going to
lie I really like them they fit really
well you can't see my kneecaps in them
listen you don't need to see my and
renal kidney cap and this top is giving
I love the curve and love the shape of
the curve but it's not great quality
material I mean it's kind of that's it
without a bra it's not it it seems like
it's too long a t-shirt like it's
dipping really low but I love when you
know t-shirts dips and curves like that
I'm going to wear this to the movies
tonight let's go we have a white dress
oh sorry for my crime I thought it would
be a lot more expensive than that it
looks nice and far but it is giving me a
bit of a around here is doing something
very strange and it goes up at the side
I think it is something like I love this
bit you guys know me sweetheart neckline
and off-the-shoulder patricia all day
but smell the flowers around here isn't
know yeah also you would not be going
for 99 I feel like it looks a little bit
schoolgirl for me it's Little House on
the Prairie meet Dancing with the Stars
alright so this dress here another set
is $32 and I remember the reason why I
bought this dress it looks exactly like
a dress from a brand I really like
called Misha collection alright this is
this dress on this is my I really like
it raised mmm
hi look at this dress do you ever do
roleplay when you put on an outfit
you've got talking to yourself resin in
scenarios that haven't happened excuse
me how good is this dress this is
exactly the same as the music collection
dress I'm not even going to lie because
actually boy it is gorgeous
oh my god and there's a little bit of
loose thread here that would need to be
cut off I just noticed that there but
come on now come on now do the
instagrams dance okay so this t-shirt is
$17.99
I love the stretching everything on it
and it has got this tie detail
unfortunately it looks like a little bit
of a good price penis because it's just
hanging down just kind of pitiful but I
don't understand why it's so long then I
bet the teacher and if I should untie it
but it looks like it's cut here
who's this just like that that's what
incidentally which I had in my head
depressed even the teachers achieve max
allows the distress look but why does
ever distress penis as well I think all
I need to do is like touch the penis in
would you touch with unison yeah I can
cut my penis and I can have a little
ball and then as a little ball is cute
okay guys I have done that was so long
there's so many pieces but you know I
want it to be a little bit more
extensive this time around and I will be
honest with you I was a little bit more
thoughtful with my picks this time and I
really wanted to just really pick items
that I would chain really where
genuinely like not have a problem with
and I also tried not to pick items that
are just the ones I've seen other people
wearing and I was looking for stuff that
was a bit more my style my overall
thoughts are this right so my idea of
fashion over is that it was similar to a
she inside a wrong way and a wish it's
not that
maybe that's me being completely wrong
it's not one of those websites and it's
more like a river island or a bit more
like a Topshop so the prices are higher
I notice that the things that I really
really like were on the higher end price
so they were setting for four dollars
and up I don't think anything was less
than $17.99 not at all so but the items
that were around that mark we're a bit
more like not really a fan but if it was
like 34 on a breath I was on it it's not
that kind of it's not a cheap bargain
website for short and I will say about
actually some of the items are a really
really good quality like really really
really good quality like really thick
bangies material quite heavy and
actually quite stylish and not all
thought where okay I think that I think
I said that loved them that you see you
like you see the prophets of God or the
classes of class girls wearing it I feel
like you might need to find something
there's a similar personal style and ask
them what they get from the website
versus maybe looking at some of the
celebrities who don't have the same
silages other good thing is that they
often have coupons and discounts on the
weekends and you can find coupons on
literature and get to look at
everybody's Instagram page you'll
probably find a 20% of 30% off as I
logged into the website today
there was a was I think it was a 20% off
today only but that was on the screen
with I use it and I believe they have
one every weekend so you need to keep
your eyes peeled for that they've got
two days shipping in the u.s. in the UK
however I don't believe that the
shipping the shipping is definitely not
that fast and I picked up my items when
I was in the US and I haven't been
charged import duties from the US which
is a good thing and since I made my last
order now they don't do refunds that I
can see so far so if you pick up
something and you're not sure about it
we're not confident in it then you only
have the options to do an exchange which
I know some people don't like I do
think that if you kind of wait around
you might be able to find something that
you like good they've got a lot a lot of
items on the side if anything slightly
too many so it took me a while to search
to really find the items that I actually
wanted because there's a lot of stuff
that isn't my style on there but then as
you can see there's some eise's there
that will really write out my sheet
finally the jeans so from what I've
heard everybody talks about the jeans
like literally the jeans are amazing and
the key reason why the jeans are amazing
is because they've got stretch in them
but actually the classic one I found in
a bit too stretchy and a bit too thin
but some of the other styles that were
actually affordable with rightly thick
heart not as stretchy but fit like a
girl for me and I must refer them to the
classic Jean which I thought was quite
interesting forget if the case is that
there was good amount of strips in the
jeans which I can totally see why sick
girls who have you know a bigger bun and
or more curves and a smaller waist but
isn't that the dream the dream both of
all jeans are very similar to a Topshop
jeans but actually more affordable so I
would definitely look at getting a jean
from net the dresses are really good the
more expensive dresses are really good
like at this $35 and above and here for
it so those are my overall thoughts and
I really hope that you were able to feel
like I kept it as impartial as possible
even though you know the team called me
in to have a look and naturally like see
what the brand in the company is about I
want this is all about you guys and what
you think and taking or feedback to
hopefully companies are seen if that
wasn't part of the plan but clearly they
are and but yeah I appreciate you guys
first and foremost and whatever you say
like you said it if here and the rest of
the world are seeing it so I feel like
it's so powerful that or YouTube and
like people might move based on what we
say can you believe it guys okay
believe that other guys I will see you
very very soon if you're not follow me
on my Instagram or my snapchat make sure
you follow me and on my Twitter as well
I post more outfits and stuff like that
there's been more insight into my
lifestyle a little bit in more insight
into what I'm thinking you know what I'm
figuring so check out my Instagram I
factored out my Twitter then the
meantime I'll catch you later
