know I look different you know I'm like
I changed my look all the time I've gone
back to short hair and I feel like for
me short hair is just the wine I feel
like the most comfortable with it I feel
like I look styled with it but yeah I'm
going to get into that another point in
time I know I've got so much to update
you guys on I am so sorry we're going to
get there been doing a lot of beauty
tutorials at the moment but now it's
time for a chatty video in time for me
to sit down and just share some thoughts
with you guys and it's taken me a while
to come about to doing this video
because sometimes it's quite hard to
think about what to have a chat about
what I wanted to talk about becoming a
woman
now that you know and obviously I've
always been female but it's you know
those things that happen I feel as you
get older that really make you feel like
you know what I'm one but now and I've
been doing some videos on the Lynette's
channel and it was all about you know
those embarrassing teenage questions and
all those things that you face as a
teenager and I'm going to link it all
the videos down below so you can check
them out there's going to be quite a few
videos and it was quite quite
interesting to reminisce and talk about
what things were like with me as a
teenager when it came to family my
appearance boys and all that kind of
stuff and now just comparing that to
these Bay's that I feel a little bit
more comfortable in my skin but I'm
basically going to address the same kind
of topics but now that I feel like I am
a woman or that I am a bit more mature
and I hope this is one ever do that
you know girls who are like me you can
connect with feeling certain ways as a
teenager to being different to how you
feel now and some of you guys who are
going through that phase are just trying
to like get out of that awkward stage or
feel like you need someone to talk to or
to connect with so that's what we're
going to do today let's get a cup of tea
and get comfortable
I'm feeling really sophisticated right
now you bet I feel like a woman so
number one when it came to my physical
appearance and and growing up and
growing into my body and stuff like that
and obviously as a teenager when I our
biggest issues was that I was very
skinny
I had no cars and I was ugly horrible
hairs just awful right
and for me it was the thing that
bothered me but to an extent I didn't
really think about it too much I was
quite confident on the inside and I've
relied on other things to be honest but
as I did grow older I then got to a
stage of feeling like oh my gosh you
know what Patricia you actually look
good you've grown up you've grown into
yourself and then kind of with the dawn
or social media there are times when I
definitely feel quite insecure I felt
quite insecure with the way I looking
and you know not feeling entirely
comfortable as my body changes as I get
older as well and there are things that
I feel like as I have got older have
changed about my physical appearance and
I always say to people you know what you
know a girl what will happen and and it
might come from the inside or from the
outside or physically you just change
and you grow into yourself which is what
I've done and I think that for me when
it's come to my physical appearance I'm
someone who's now you know played with
making changes and if there's something
I don't like I realize I can do
something about it and if I can't do
something about it then roll with it and
rock with it and another thing I've
really learnt when it comes to physical
appearance when you're older is that
actually it's really not that important
when you're younger when you feel like
I'm so ugly or whatever or I feel
horrible about the way I know is that
there's other skills that you develop
and I said this about the glow-up or
being the ugly friend there are so many
other skills that you develop and when
it comes to the real world
physical appearance is a nice element
but if you've got physical appearance
and you don't have anything else to
bring to the table it gets really boring
really quickly and developing you know
my mind my humor the way interact with
people my smarts has been something that
I've been I've tried to pride myself on
and even if I'm not you know mainstream
amazing there's other things about me
that make me a more beautiful person and
also when it came to clothing and style
as a teenager not honor I did not have
what my family didn't have lots of money
and they were not buying me
designer there were no Nike trainers for
me no and I you know I now I'm able to
buy those nice things but I also feel
like it's really important to be someone
who's a bit more willing to go against
the tide when it comes to style and Aldo
and actually when I started on YouTube
vintage shopping was what I was doing
later go to I was rich vintage in
Manchester and of thrifting and stuff
like that and I kind of forgot about
that and I fed up specially what the
bond so now I feel like I want to go
back to that and I feel like nowadays I
don't want to necessarily buy into like
really fast fashion anymore and that I
want to buy into more investment pieces
that fit my body verses are part of you
know just the trends and stuff like that
and I think that is something that
happens to you when you get older number
two my relationship with my families and
friends so why don't we go to family
growing up my family were very very
strict and I was at home and if you
watch a video with Lynette you will find
out more about that situation dealing
with strict parents was a real real
thing and I now reflect and think I'm so
grateful that my parents were quite
straight because they kind of protected
me from you know going into certain bad
things and I was probably quite
embarrassed about my parents as well
because they're foreign and they do not
care they trying to be cool they will
tell you about yourself in public and
you know what I was actually very
embarrassed
but now the other get the more that I
see my parents I I am literally in all
of them now and I'm like wow man and mum
you're kind of cool in your own weird
Nigerian mother way you are simply quite
cool and then the old I've got the more
built relationship with them but I
become more protective of my parents and
I nowadays my parents used to tell me
what to do I tell my parents what to do
that won't be disagree but I'm like no
mom you need to do this dad
I'm really thinking that you need to do
this right now and I now have reversed
the roles of my parents which is
actually quite funny and they really do
trust me and I think that if you're
having
bad relationships with your parents and
what some of you guys might have me and
my mom fought like cat and dog right I
told a story already and we were like
like that and then we got really really
close and then you get to a place of
maturity is that realistically as much
as you can try and respect your parents
or obey your parents in their face but
then do do that and you know people do
go through rough patches but avoid
trying to get into a position where
where you insult your parents or to a
place of no return and I have heard
comments and had comments where people
are like they are put down by their
family and you know I was never put down
for my from by my family I feel so
blessed that I've had such a positive
family but when you have that kind of
situation sometimes you kind of need to
take it out and then develop your
maturity and hopefully as you get older
you were able to go back to your parents
and be like well you know what this is
how I felt and they may feel like you
know some kind of regret but try not to
resent your parents and all that good
stuff so friends so I've always been a
floater when it comes to friends I do
have a core key group I don't see them
all the time I don't see them every day
but I do have a core key group and sadly
I feel like when it has come to friends
and friendships building and it's not
really changed for me I feel like I can
be the floater and I've been that and
there were people at my core friends are
the same friends that I've had from
college and we don't fight we don't
argue we're all very very different so
there's no there's no competition and I
really quite like that about my
friendship group but I don't have like
that hard core I call this girl every
day or whatever I don't have anyone that
like that besides my partner and the
reality when it come that come to
friendship is that they come and go
they're people who are in your life or
season for a reason
no the rest at centers I I can never
remember it and I appreciate the friends
that in my life but I've realized I
can't come to it come to rely on friends
whereas I know that when I was young
oh that's like y'all any friend or
movers favor being quite you know quite
concerned about not having you know lots
of friends or lots of close friends and
being this kind of nomad when it came to
a friendship good but you know what it
hasn't really changed me besides my
Corky frozen sister and and I've even if
I just sat here just said well Patricia
maybe that's just the way it is and some
people are built to have lots of friends
and all this kind of you know
connections of people and some people
are in and out of you know people's
lives and maybe that's where I stand
some love and relationships well
obviously I am now married and I what's
let me think all right number one I was
always awkward with boys I mentioned
this you know I did not like boys boys
did not like me I mean I liked boys I
liked boys from afar but no ain't no
boyfriend's in me so obviously I'd liked
boys but they didn't really like me and
I was quite sure I was shy quite awkward
and then I became that kind of the girl
who'd be boys friends but wouldn't
necessarily have boyfriends if that
makes any sense and then and that's one
because of the way I looked I was not
that physically attractive you know when
when I was younger and then obviously I
got kind of into the dating scene a
little bit and then I got hooked up and
quite quite early I got hooked up with
my husband now when I was like 19
so that was off the market real quick I
didn't get to really enjoy that kind of
life dating scene and having breakups
and well yeah I had heartbreak
definitely but I'm kind of looking at my
friends and the people that I know boy
this love game is a really real fighting
daveigh is really really real I think
number one it's um it's been really put
important and even with myself to really
be strong in who you are and not to
compromise and it's not about the hunt
it's all about this being thirsty and
the more independent and not in not like
independent women because I feel like
women need to you know need to be open
but the more a woman is kind of
confident in herself the more she's able
to attract a man and all or develop you
know develop those relationships I
thought guys do like women who are quite
quite powerful quite strong for for more
my like good friends and even given
myself all of the girls who have wrong
long-term relationships they are gods
who are like those fiery women and I
don't know a bit of a trait but it's all
about loving yourself first definitely
developing yourself and being confident
in yourself
and having something that is of you you
have there both bring something to the
table you know and not lean on each
other too much it is all about
equilibrium equilibrium that's a big
word Patricia and that's definitely
something I've seen about love and
relationships and I I do remember that
know being younger I thought that um you
know oh my god
my heart's moaning I die like I don't
like being so enamored by guys like when
I like them and then I just only ended
up in like just an awful situation so
girls don't be enamored ya have your own
lean on yourself and then when you do
have the opportunity to get into a
relationship you know you both bring
equal value to a table so the future is
this what I thought my future was going
to be the answer to that is definitely
not number one when I was younger I
don't think I was going to live to see
27 like I didn't think I would be alive
I couldn't really visualize it I thought
I'd get married at like 22 and have a
baby by of two babies by 26 and then I
couldn't see past that and but now it's
like you realize wow things are
different and in regards to jobs and
stuff like that I don't really have a
real clue of what I would be be doing
you know um but I knew that I was going
to be successful I always wanted to be
successful and I always visualized that
for myself and I never thought I never
saw myself in any other way but
successful and I feel like that has
helped me now my I would definitely say
if you are a young person even if you
ever got everything like
down to a tee just visualize yourself in
a positive positive environment I
couldn't you know and it's not because I
was delusional or something my first
likely am I just always had good hopes
for my future I was excited um but I
didn't know I'd been doing YouTube I
didn't know I'd be with Mike I didn't
know that I wouldn't have kids just yet
I didn't know that I would travel so
much I didn't know that I would love
speaking as much as I do because I loved
entertaining and talking to people but
not on a stage or anything like that but
the future I realized that the future is
not what you plan or what you expect but
it usually works out well
okay if you keep a positive perspective
your future will work out well and will
turn out right for you as it's meant to
be and I feel like everything kinds of
works everything kind of works out
together good you know if you have the
right attitude and you have love in your
hearts bit of a lover and you just treat
people well you know and bad things come
they come they go you love for them
that's what definitely something that
I've learned now so guys I hope you
enjoyed that video I just felt like
doing something that was a little bit
different and a little bit you know out
of my heart and I feel like I've not
really been as present as I was as I
would like to be so hopefully this is me
just coming back to you a little bit
mentally and I've got lots more good
stuff coming up in the next few weeks
and stuff I hope you like the regular
uploads
make sure you check out the new let's
videos on this line link them down below
they're really really good I share lots
of my stories growing up as a teenager
now it's very awkward and embarrassing
questions as well but hopefully that
gives you some inspiration about
womanhood for those of you who are there
you can probably high-five and grieve me
as some of you guys who you know
thinking about it hopefully it'll not
thinking about it you're on that way
there it gives you some inspiration that
things will you know be good in the end
so guys thank you so much for watching
and I'll catch you later bye this video
