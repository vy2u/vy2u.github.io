welcome to my channel today I'm doing a
video where I'm going to transform
myself on beach bum to beach babe and
I'm going to share with you what I do
for like my looks when I'm like on the
beach and stuff too a nice glamorous
evening look because you know you've got
out one night which is at least I'm
currently in a lovely island of
Mauritius I kind of needed a break and
it's our five year anniversary for me my
baby we all came out here and we've just
been enjoying the sunshine also this
video is going to be a chatty one
because I feel like I've got a lot to
just get off my chest and just to talk
to you guys about my channel and right
now I am just looking for the kind of
mosquito spray because I've already been
bitten up sitting out here and I'm
panicked
right lychee panics Michael is doing a
gentleman and spraying me up alright
amazing
okay so I'm not one of those seeds but I
don't wear makeup on the beach I wear
makeup on the beach realistically the
water doesn't go past here for me unless
I'm like snorkeling and I'll still be
wearing makeup anyway I said it I
confess I'm one of those people but all
about ensuring that this skincare is set
right and for me I'm loving this
LaRouche per say this is the it's a
anti-shine invisible freshness it's a
sunscreen in a myth and it's back to 50
uva/uvb look at this watch this people
watch this
I'm covered I'm actually covered it's
unbelievable so the lady in the store
who was demonstrating this and I thought
oh my god I have to have it like I went
to buy like 10 bottles of this it's
actually amazing and but then I also use
a sunscreen this is a more ad luminous
shield SPF 50 you'll notice like my body
is it's like a different skin tone to my
face so my face and up here is a lot
darker so it reacts quite a lot to the
Sun I'm just going to go ahead and
washed her eyes and I always try to get
my lips because these actually get burnt
and they already look a little bit burnt
up and crusty at the moment I really
wanted to talk about my channel and at
the moment and I know that some people
haven't liked some of the videos I've
done recently and I'm going to be honest
with you I actually totally a grin I've
had a lot of projects on recently and
sponsored work and I did some that were
a little bit out of my comfort zone and
you guys could all tell be honest truth
is sometimes I try to like push myself
and do stuff that sounds a bit different
just because I feel like it might be
nice and creative to bring something to
the table different but sometimes you do
it and you're like you know what this
wasn't the best thing for me to do and I
think my promise to you guys that will
never ever do anything that I don't
genuinely enjoy again right victory I
did something that I didn't enjoy that
much and you guys all knew like you guys
are like Georgia blink if you're being
held run to the rug like oh my god like
seriously okay so the pencil I just used
is the L'Oreal Paris brow artist shaper
this pencil is absolutely an entirely
like this is my best and favorite eye
brow product
look look house more like if it's you're
going to be in love very very soon this
is very very good okay so for my
concealer and using the NARS soft matte
peachy concealer I don't need to say
more this stays on like no man's
business it's so so so good I do have a
tutorial coming out
a partnership tutorial but honestly like
look this is the only conceal I have on
this holiday and it's been a life favor
I wanted to show you guys on my makeup
kit for when I'm on holiday I basically
have one makeup bag at this and I also
have one skincare bag snatching little
bit of a bit of primer on and the reason
I like to wear like makeup not not
full-blown a full-blown face but if I
just need to protect my skin
I mean I'm currently using benefits
professional just to help with the shine
because I will be glowing on the beach
like seriously and then I'm just going
to add some concealer just under my eyes
to see how that concealer literally just
elevated me and it's not liking where my
kevie makeup on anything it just makes
me looks a little bit bright throw a
little bit more away around my mouth I'm
going to put a little bit of Studio Fix
fluid for mac funny enough I don't wear
the matte foundation I think you guys
know this but I went to the airport
there's no particular reason
there's other foundations I just like me
and but we're to the airport and I
couldn't get any other foundation
besides Mac and it's been such a long
time but I've been really enjoying like
early enjoying this foundation I think I
want to add it to my main collection
again and honestly I pry it's just
really really lightly so I don't know
I've got this Bielema between wearing
lip gloss and the beach or not look at
all I've I've been bitten
okay heaven because you can actually end
up burning your lips so I put some lip
balm on on the side put some scarring on
I'm just literally or extra and do not
I'm going to go with Too Faced repeat
so what I like to do is actually to add
a little bit of highlight I mean you
don't really mean highlight when it is
like already just boiling but you know
what why not a little bit slow I'm
actually using this Kiko high pigment
it's not a highlighter but it really
does give you the Cologne which is just
going to be genuinely honest I actually
do wear mash in I'm not even a gene like
I actually do real lashes this is my
lash ball it's at cheats or BOTS and I
have lashes that I wear on the beach
because I'm like that and I know zones
without my bikini I'm actually on my
beach well because I want to be great
okay okay guys so that is my beach bum
look and I know it's not very bunny but
you know I mean that gives different to
Michael Abner and it just gives you a
nice Julie look for being on the beach
but not as tired look because sometimes
you can visit fo x like it's 29 degrees
out here so I think like 32 degrees so I
know if you're going to be like perfect
but if I do get sweating and stuff I can
just dab dab dab and it doesn't go all
patchy and I really like this oh and of
course it's important to finish off with
some sunscreen I cannot get enough of
this with that I mean it she cannot get
enough of this stuff
I just ate it though using SATCOM oh
yeah this might be so I'm not I'm going
to go and enjoy for a little bit and
then I will come at this evening oh not
in June I think I'll come back later on
I don't know if you guys want to see my
bikini or not but you see a little bit
of it this one is off my hair is why
hair currently I have to basically wash
it and condition it every day otherwise
it can end up looking like a bush which
happens if Crimea is all good but once
it's set listen this is laid okay so
this is my future purchase items I
always wear shorts dogs in the beach
until Omachi on the beach in my mind
then go what high-waisted bikini bottoms
on the beach we shall perform skaters
are tearing back now and actually just
wet my face I've wiped my face is my
simple words because I have to buy these
at the airport I didn't bring any other
wipes with me
I remember they'll actually alright
they're not my favorite works but they
work they're okay and crazies now clear
I'd rather still intact I'm going to get
my glam going there's this quad here
that I made up from different colors at
Matt there's got my favorite colors in
it which is basically orange gold and
brown these are colors I wear all the
time and are perfect on my holiday and I
just go in with a wash of orange on my
eyes and then I go ahead with the NARS
concealer just to help my gold that
you're going to put underneath or on top
pot and look really really nice so I
went in with the gold and that just gave
me some added drama because I was about
to be very extra for this evening after
that I went with Anastasia apparel eight
that collaboration mariota's color in
there called Valencia which is of my
favorite kind of like a purpley brown
and just gives me some added warmth in
my crease and just to give me a little
bit more dimension and then with my
concealer I went in and highlighted
under my eyes a pianist I'm living a lie
like I feel like my face looks
absolutely flawless because I've caught
a little bit of Sun which I actually
quite like but of course I've got to do
my dramatic highlighting contour routine
and I went ahead and blended that in
with a Beauty Blender and then after
that I went in with some foundation as
well I'm using more or less the same
product I use any other day because I
didn't bring this huge makeup kit with
me
oh this contour stick from Mac literally
as another favorite of mine
not sure why Mac is just popping up back
in my and collection but I like some of
the newer products go ahead and I am
baked with my special powder and I felt
like I really have to bake for ages
because the level of oil when he
needs to stick and be there the whole
night and then I went ahead with my
mascara and which is the L'Oreal since
car which is lychee afraid of mine as
well
I go ahead and bust that off as well and
I feel like you know I do needed to I
did need to add a bit more time to
mention to my face a go ahead with this
contour stick a bit of blush highlight
little powder and that was basically me
done and then I went in with my food a
beauty liquid lipstick in this color and
another one as well and that is
basically it my glam is now done and
I've had a bit quite well because it
gets so although it's quite a cool day
today but it does get really hot so I am
baked right let's get the glam on my
dress is from the sky did so this video
is in a perfect video but I just wanted
to give a quick get ready with me and
style video while I was away so I'll be
home this week and I'll catch you guys
