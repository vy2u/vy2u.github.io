today I am kind of doing get ready with
me or I'm kind of recreating the look
format of my most recent baby shower
slash birthday and this is the look that
I had but I didn't actually do my look
it was done by my makeup artist and my
hairstylist they came and they surprised
me my sister organized it all I wanted
it to be a chatty one but I basically
was waffling and I'm sorry I've
forgotten how to speak in front of the
camera if I don't do it for like two
weeks I'm like I don't even know what
I'm doing and I felt so ridiculous and
then they started talking again in it so
yeah we will see what we can possibly do
I have my hand is healing up nicely just
as a quick update so if you don't know I
had K wires ID two pins put in here
which is where I will see some ugly
scars and then I take this off if I want
to have got a brace my fing finger is
slightly bent but it is lifting up and
getting a lot better than it was so I'm
just having fizzy on it and hopefully I
should be able to straighten it out
eventually
I think that's it I will link everything
in the description bar below all the
details about my hair products I'm using
I like guys thank you for watching and I
will catch you later bye first thing I'm
starting off with is a primer and I'm
using the rimmel primer so I'm almost
thing they don't like this power but I'm
really quite like this time I think it's
really good so quick updates if you
don't know I had an amazing baby shower
if you guys followed me on snapchat and
Instagram organized by my sister and
then the morning of around 4 a.m. our
car was broken into and guess what they
stole the camera and the camera was my
filming camera so this is a new filming
camera and then I had transferred the
memory card from my robbed camera into
the big camera and so all the footage
from the morning
and the majority of my baby shower was
on the other camera everybody sent me
some footage which is really good so
that was just like you know we have one
bad thing after another happen is that
is so annoying but yeah foundation she
used was the NARS foundation in which is
my foundation I kind of put it aside for
a while I've been trying new foundations
but she used this on me because it's
good for like a long day I definitely
agree and the color is Banaras which is
super rich and warm and if you know me I
love a warm foundation I've gone from
gray to like rich then I'm gonna be
honest with you there are times where
you just don't feel like you look your
best okay I am currently going through
that stage and I it's okay to say I know
that people get really annoyed at me
like for saying that oh I don't feel my
best looking but it's true I'm not gonna
hide it and say that I don't
and so when I'm putting my makeup on and
stuff just the act of doing it makes me
feel better it's not the actual makeup
is the fact that I'm willing to take
some time for myself and just do that
because I haven't really done any of it
oh right yeah okay so I'm going to go
ahead and it concealed again the
concealer was that my concealer it's the
bare minerals bare skin concealer and I
do really really like this one I think
it is lovely and what is it moisturizing
if I call it moisturizing kind of
moisturizing and it really just makes my
face look so much more highlighted and
nice and it's so funny like my makeup
artist she takes so much time to do
makeup I get I'm not gonna lie Esther it
takes her and I were to do a face but
obviously when the face is done the face
is done like amazingly and I said this
in like a last video of mine that it's
all about taking your time when you do
makeup and really really thinking about
if she thinks really seriously about it
as well when she's doing my face I'm
going ahead and I'm using up my brow
pomade from Anastasia I'm using
the color chocolate which is a nice and
warm
I'm going to be honest with you I don't
know how to get my brows as amazing as
my makeup artist does but um she's a pro
on my eyes I'm using the Urban Decay
palette and I think this is the kind of
Gwen Stefani collaboration but basically
I'm just mixing some nice nudes and some
Purple's together I'm using stark and
zone on my lid and I'm using Punk in my
crease and I'm also using a Kiko color
as well setting powder she's is this
Sasha which I've heard loads about and
then you can get it on Amazon so I got
it on Amazon and I find it warmer than
the Ben Nye powder
this is the Loreal false eyelash sculpt
mascara I really do love the brush on
this it's not your normal mascara brush
is an excellent brush though I'm gonna
use my velour lashes because they are my
favorite lashes and they do give you the
most gorgeous effect and if you are
smart you can get them you can wear them
at ten twenty times whatever they are
expensive but they're so worth it
these lashes are literally my favorite
they're so glamorous and so nice
I find that she's so easy to put on at
the moment but that was not the case
back in the day okay so another product
that I don't normally use which my
artists use of me is the Milani and this
is the baked blush in coralina and I
have the baked bronzer in blue as well
so I'm going to go ahead and use these I
picked them up on Amazon they come
really quickly so that's what that looks
like
yeah I use this to like highlight me and
make medicine you know oh gosh it got
bit excited I always get excited anyway
put this on the tip of my nose and
bridge as well the highlight is nice but
it's actually quite so I usually use the
NARS which basically has me very much
like 3d highlight but yeah I like this
this is nice
personally I don't think this is a very
nice blush blush but it looks good on me
when she did it so I think it's a bit
cold it's alright
oh yeah but I'm sorry that I have
subjected you to having to have a look
at these lips for this whole time is she
used lip liner the whole time and she
used my tongue off on the outside and
she liked me she always does like kind
of what not afridi lip but i have to
have more of an ombre to give my lips
much more shape and definition
I added some pinky it's a pink line that
actually from Primark and she actually
left it there and I'm gonna go ahead and
go in with the Kiko brown liner just to
make it a little bit more brownie so
moving on to my hair
I had it on the baby shower I kind of
have like really loose waves I've
literally just sorted out my edges to
let you know what hair I have in I have
a full frontal so it goes from you know
here to here to about around here as
well I love a full frontal because it
gives you a much flatter look and for me
I find it a little bit easier some
people wear their frontals you know
really forward I don't I wear mine
slightly behind my hairline because I
have a short forehead and I've got a
really full hairline so whenever I wear
like a frontal really forward I just
look really really strange I just look
like an alien so for me that doesn't
work I know there's loads of people that
it looks really good on I'm gonna link
all my hair details in the description
bar so you can totally do that if you
want to but yeah my hair stylist did my
hair like she created this kind of Kim K
like Hollywood waves like that so I'm
gonna try and redo it she showed me how
she did it
I'm not a pro but we'll get there doing
my hair has literally been the hardest
thing because I have to like even to
hold my brush I've kind of got to push
the finger to hold the brush be really
careful when I'm doing it but I love it
the color I'm using is this color from w
a.m. I'm gonna say to you that this is
the best hair color ever because it's a
professional color and it works like so
well oh and it's got a really good
swivel head so you'll be able to see but
it turns here amazing and when I wear a
closure I always just use the heat to
kind of flatten it at the very top as
well that makes a difference to make
sure that your closure doesn't look so
high please bear with me
curling is quite hard for me to do by
myself at the moment
what she then did was from pinged these
and I'm totally not doing it anywhere
close to as well as she did it there's
your hairstylist when you need her but
hopefully I should be able to get the
right effect she basically was able to
create roles that made really flat all
along here so clearly I'm not as good as
a pro when it comes to curling but I
should be able to achieve the same
effect which is what she did say to me
cuz this is Jenny me like a skill so
while this cold I'm just going to do one
big go here this is not what she did
this is what you'll do if you're feeling
really really Maisie diminish I still
think it can still look quite nice that
still looks tidy just going to use a big
pin here right it all calls off women
I've put my outfit on that that I wore
as well yeah they won't like this so
I've got my outfit on my I wore and
please believe that I messed up the
whole thing while I was doing it it's
fine this is a good thing about pink I
think you can basically hold the pins in
place and they should look good if they
are cold so I'm just going to basically
release everything to see what I've got
going on and what it does it kind of
kind of holds the curl a lot deeper set
into the hair if that makes any sense
like it makes it like much more in it
and as messy as I did it you can still
see how they've really stayed in place
and how much of a pro I'm not but yeah
they look good
she basically brushed them and when you
brushed them they all kind of connect
together and create a gorgeous Hollywood
wave and obviously if I had done the
back that was kind of or follow through
all the way down and I was really scared
about brushing the curls out for
actually brushing them out creates a
really nice effect so that is my
finished look I love the way the hair
looks it's not exactly the
it was on the day mine had a bit more of
a proper Hollywood way but I think that
takes a little bit more practice but I
still like the way it looks and I didn't
even do the back I was being really
really lazy so I just recreated the look
from my baby shower and it's such a
lovely day it was my birthday as well
this is quite a low-cut top so I'm not
wearing no bra were there and I've got
quite large nipples at the moment but
this here is the bomb secret covers if
you want to go braless you need these I
love the way this girls just like hell
look there's a little bit of side boob
showing I love the way these work these
really do like hold the girls down or
the nipples down that if they you know
if it's a little bit chilly or you know
they might want to stand out a little
bit more so these are my secret so guys
I hoped you enjoyed this video you can
catch my vlog if you want to see what
has been happening in my actual life
recently so I'll link that in the
description bar below
I do have clips from my baby shower but
obviously as I had my camera robbed I've
kind of put on one tire of the clips we
could find from everyone he came I just

supportive and lovely and I will catch
