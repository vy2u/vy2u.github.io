one video that I absolutely love and I
did this last year and it was the
Christmas gift ideas for girls who are
fairly similar to me love beauty makeup
YouTube and all that kind of thing that
I'm sure many of you have friends who
are like this or guys who might be
thinking what can I do what can I get a
girl for Christmas hopefully this video
is helpful and I must say I am a living
proof you know last year I had an imac
on the top of my Christmas gifts from
guys all from my partner and hear the
testimony behind me so girls if you have
anything that you want I would just say
leave them in the comment put this on
your wall as a little hint hint you know
oh my god I love that handbag linky no
just do that okay and hopefully guys you
find this useful and it gives you a few
ideas on what to get girls for this
Christmas so the first thing on my list
I've written girls toys and I'm thinking
ipads ipods iphone 5 and tablets Kindles
so all of these kind of electrical
equipment which are on trend and are
really useful because women we love
useful things to be honest and we want
to be able to keep in contact with our
friends and families and that's why we
want these things so if you can afford
to go out and get these things great if
you can't cases for these things are
absolutely amazing I actually picked up
this laptop or even an ipad case from
Topshop and it's amazingly on trend it
has studied crosses all over it and I
think it's absolutely fabulous for a
girl who wants to just carry it almost
like a clutch bag but it's a laptop bag
and its really trendy and it's really
affordable at 22 pounds so actually I'm
going to give this away to someone who's
watching today if you want this then
just leave a comment below and we will
do a giveaway over this video I never
plan to do it but I'm going to do a
giveaway with this video so the second
item on my list isn't a tangible item
but it's about the thought that counts
it's the experience
I think taking a girl out to do an
activity it's just beautiful something
like the theater or on holiday if you
can afford that but if you're gonna go
to the theater I'm thinking Spice Girls
I'm thinking Viva laglam any guy out
there who is willing to take a go to
watch the Spice Girls you are amazing
okay and I think that you know for us
girls we would take each other out to
watch something like that as a Christmas
present it's just beautiful experience
and we all love the spice girls you know
if you wanna be my lover you gotta get
with my friends I'm a little down
running out of it sorry Lana Del Rio no
no ha ha how'd of you sing with me a lot
of you right yet a lot of your edibles
oh so not every girl right to make up
but I know quite a lot of girls who do
like makeup and I think makeup gift sets
are a great thing to get during the
Christmas time loads of companies are
selling them and I think it's about
getting what's useful and they'll use
again now for me I am a lip gloss in the
lipstick type of girl and Mack have an
amazing and lip gloss collection which
i'm going to show you and I think they
do these in like multiple colors but
they have from the lip gloss collection
which is really really gorgeous and it's
I think it's 25 pounds and and you get
full lip glosses we're usually one it
glosses about 15 pounds so it's an
absolute bragging and they do eyeshadow
collections and they have a brush
collection as well but this is what I
picked up and for those of you who are
fairly lazy with packaging it has got
its own really amazing packaging as well
and another thing that I would really
appreciate at Christmas is makeup
brushes so I have a collection here
which are from sigma and the sigma had
basically all the kind of professional
brushes would ever need and they last
forever i had my first set of Sigma
brushes over two years ago and I still
use them till I've just had this
collection and you know what i'm going
to do a giveaway on these as well so if
you're after brushes as well just leave
a comment and say i love the brushes and
i'll pick at random for the broad
collection from sigma just to add i'm
going to link everything below so you
can follow the links and hopefully find
some of the items that I've talked about
a great gift that girls love at
Christmastime is perfume because perfume
is usually a birthday gift or Christmas
gift and really want to go all out for
the perfumes that you pick at Christmas
I'm going to just give you a selection
of two that I'm loving the first one is
the flora botanical by Balenciaga Paris
and the packaging is just glorious and
it smells delicious I think if she's a
trendy girl and she loves new things
that are fashionable then this perfume
is absolutely fabulous you can find it
at Selfridges i believe and potentially
at Harrods as well and I'm sure there
are a few other places that silly the
next perfume set I'm recommending is the
Daisy by marc jacobs which i love
because one the packaging is so pretty
and bright and sturdy but also i can
open it so this is what it looks like on
the inside and you get the full-size
perfume bottle and also there's the mini
bottle which is what sold me on it
because i can just carry this in my
handbag as well as a moisturizer as well
which is really gorgeous so I think any
girl would like this and it's 60 pounds
so another great gift our product set so
creams and moisturizers that are a
little bit more high-end then maybe what
she may usually by and just to add to
her collection because she needs so much
more but you know we were we like
collecting things so more is more right
so I'm really loving origins at the
moment because I found that their stuff
to be paraben free fragrance free and
just really really nice and great for my
skin and they have got some of the most
amazing Christmas gift sets ever and and
they range from between 35 pounds 275
pounds and the people over there will
really help you and give you a
suggestion and what set to pick up but I
pick the make the different set which is
absolutely gorgeous and again the
packaging is really really easy to do so
you don't have to actually wrap this if
you didn't want to and you get our
full-size collection of their great
product so that's a good one so the next
gift again isn't a tangible product but
it's another experience and I think
taking a girl to a spa or paying for her
to go to a spa or get some beauty
treatment is absolutely lovely where she
can feel pampered like a princess and
I'm just trying to think of a few good
ones I do definitely know about the
urban sanctuary which is in the Herod
store and I actually have a magazine
from them and they literally do loads of
different pamper sessions and you've got
vary in prices so you're looking from 50
pounds to 150 pounds but you know they
might do hair for 30 pounds and I think
anything that makes a girl feel like a
princess it's really really valuables so
next on my list I've got accessories and
these are another thing you can't go
wrong with four gifts for girls just
because clothing sizing is such a
problem so accessories is definitely the
way to go and you can go for things such
as watches so I last year I recommended
the michael kors watch and I actually
love Michael cause but they can be a bit
on the pricey side and but there are
other alternatives from Aldo which are
just as gorgeous but for me it's all
about timeless classics of shoes and
handbags because you can just wear them
with everything and I am a style partner
actually with an accessory site which is
just fab calm and they'd have got a
bunch of bags that they've got on
lioness shoes whatever and I get to pick
some items monthly and I believe that i
picked this caper bag in October so I'm
actually going to give this away today
as well so if anyone wants this bad just
leave a comment and say you want the bag
as well but they've got a massive
selection of bags and shoes on the
website so for guys if you don't know
where to go to buy this kind of stuff
and online is a great place to start and
I can at least say I know the quality is
really good and they also put some shoes
which aren't my usual pick but when I
saw these I was like this is just
fabulous and these are foldable shoes
which I picked up from bershka calm
these are amazing flats you seen girls
on a night out and they're walking home
before well there's never a need for
that you can fold these shoes
fit them into your bag on the night out
and I was like yes I must have so I
think these are an amazing gift and I
believe there were only 25 pounds which
is really really affordable and this is
very very useful for a girl so the next
item on my list I don't have here but i
think is really really amazing and it
might sound boring to some of you but
it's not and it's storage I feel like
girls love storage especially if it
looks good last year i recommended i
believe it was the boxes where they from
again Mooji the Muji storage boxes but
and there's some other things that i've
seen online from ikea they have a nine
drawer storage box which is absolutely
stunning each layer is perfect for
makeup looking at about 80 pounds for
that but there are also jewelry boxes
that you can find on next com i'll put
those links below continuing on for like
random bits it's also home where i'm in
a position now where i am like obsessed
with homeware and trinkets and my
husband looks at me like trinkets like
what do you need those three voices for
Mike they look pretty together
coordinated so if you can just you know
appeal to her feminine and interior
decorator side things like fozzies
picture frames scented candles gallery
mirrors these are great things that
girls would absolutely love for
christmas and they keep forever and
always remember that you purchase them
for them and finally I say this every
year and I will probably always say but
it's a gift for someone else and people
will never you know be angry that you
didn't buy them something if you bought
something for someone else so there are
many charities out there and I'm going
to just list a few which I really like
where you can have the opportunity to
and you know pay for a child to go to
school pay for a family for a period of
time or give to the Red Cross or a
number of other charities to help apply
it in other countries or even in your
home country and I think you know they
fit you can get some gift certificates
for certain charities that you give back
to and I think people really do
appreciate that
anything especially if there's nothing
really want for christmas other than to
spread some Christmas cheer so guys I
hope you found that helpful and God as I
always say look just leave the comments
of the other gifts that you want below
I've already dropped a few hints in this
video and things that I want so it goes
do the same and do share the love so
thanks for watching guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
