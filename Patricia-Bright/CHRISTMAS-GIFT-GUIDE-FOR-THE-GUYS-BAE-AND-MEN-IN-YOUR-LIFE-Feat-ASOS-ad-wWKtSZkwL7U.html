have a gift guide video for you
obviously we are going into the party
season and christmas time and lots of
you guys are wanting inspiration so i'm
going to be doing loads of videos i'm
gonna try and do a video three times a
week fingers crossed I can be successful
so in Sundays Tuesdays and Thursdays
look books gift guides or the kind of
good stuff and just get everybody ready
for this season because I really like
December and you know I get really
excited with about it
but today I'm doing a men's gift guide
for 2016 and obviously I have a ram in
my life and you guys might not have at
my hand like how I have a man but you
might have brothers cousins you know
guys who you want to be the bear at some
point in time and you're thinking about
gifts that you want to get them so I'm
going to share with you affordable and
moving a bit more pricey gifts depending
on what your budget is I basically got
everything on ASOS calm because they
have amazing men's stuff and they also
have really good gifts and it's just
easier to just get everything from one
location I got my one delivery my one
thing that were you sitting here yeah
they've got really good stuffs I'm gonna
link everything in the description box
below and you can obviously check them
out but at least if this video just
gives you ideas and some of the things
that you can get the guy in your life
then I hope you enjoy and as I always
say get comfortable and get a cup of tea
or a nap in the paper please like let's
get serious about this
so the first gifts that you can get a
guy off books and I know that sounds
really boring but I find that books are
things that guys have forever and it
doesn't need to be like you know a
really complicated readin book or a
novel it could be something a book on
interest or a fun book so I've got three
books and I think I've got four bits
here that I really like one is a book on
travel this is the Lonely Planet best
Travel 2016 me and my happy we love love
love love love to travel and even if you
don't travel but you want inspiration I
think this is really good and let me
come it is great when you actually go
away to find out right spots to go to
and things to see and I've genuinely
used a Lonely Planet book in the past
and it's quite a good man book as a
woman book as well after that it's got
to be a cookery book and I know what
it's like in my home you know my husband
is not a big chef or anything like that
but um he likes it binky is I'm Jamie
Oliver at times and there's something
about either you can get homes in him
she like girly cooking book or you can
get like a man book and I really like
this book this is called the hot sauce
cookbook so about cooking the chilies
and spice and guys like to be in here
I can eat loads of chilies so I think
this is quite as good cookbook to get as
guys after that there are things like an
in spoke box so this is a dream cars
book which has got loads and loads of
like pictures of just it's basically car
porn
basically cardboard and it looks so good
and I think any guy who's either into
cars or in his spy by card and I think
young kids would really you know like a
book like this just because it's like
inspiration I think it's certain right
but you might have someone who's into
planes or someone who's into shoes or
into rap or into CDs or something like
that
you can get books based on all those
inspiration and then I just saw this
little book it's called stuff every man
should know and I select some of the
experts as well it was really funny and
really quite good it's kind of like a
little black book for guys so the next
thing you can get a guy is a fragrance
and there's so many fragrances out there
and to be honest I don't know how much
guys genuinely care about fragrance
versus the fact that they're just happy
to receive something that's gonna make
them smell nests
musky at times and I feel like guys in
there but by fragrances themselves
usually and Christmas and birthdays is
the time where they get them but I
thought that this Ted Baker one was
really nice I've smelt it in the past
and I really
the pathogen obviously my husband isn't
really thinking about the packaging but
I'm sure if we've seen this on his you
know but your marketing cabinet table
whatever helping all this looks nice but
there's an array of fragrances that are
out there for guys and took many
something it's great if you pick a
fragrance that smells good to you
because I shouldn't say this but lots of
the time guys want to smell good for
themselves but also smoke look for that
woman's and you like it you're believin
would like me to like it
so the next thing you can get a guy in
your life is a grooming set and I know
that all the boys that I know my family
they love receiving groomers says they
pretend that they don't but they do one
because a lot of the time they just
don't know where to start
it depends on the guys some guys I'm
really Metro the guys in my life are
really not that I either really know
what a moisturizer is I come on you need
to moisturize your skin and I've
actually my husband's did the skin age
test and his skin age test was 14 back
is actually unbelievable cause he
doesn't wear sunscreen
he doesn't wear moisturizer and he's
really pale and I read but a penis and
moisturize boy in science means but
everything that he needed and he really
appreciated the fact that he had
something that he could put together so
I really think it's really good if you
can get you know sex together this is
the scheme for skin care kits and men
from bulldog and it's got a moisturizer
a scrub and a wash I think it's great if
a guy can have a collection like this
that have everything all together
especially if it comes in like what you
would call it bag
what is that's called wash bag wash bag
like this I know my husband uses this
all the time or he will use the wash bag
all the time so it's basically got free
product it's got the moisturizer the
face scrub and the face wash as well I
do like Bulldog as a good man
screaming ground I think it's really
really nice and I also have this set
here and it's a travel set as well I
think this is super nice because it's
got different shampoos body wash shave
cream moisturizer moisturizers are
essential I don't know why guys forget
them but yeah it's got everything in it
really easy and if you want to travel a
lot then this is great but I think it's
not just the trouble but it's just for
everyday but they get a nice little kit
that looks really nice and I love lovely
like the packaging design of this brand
like it's so amazing that it is toys and
games and I think you can have games for
you know the kiddies you can have games
for the tees you can a schedule it and I
thought I can't Christmas time this is
the time where you're gonna play games
when you aren't open your present and
you get together after your turkey and
you play some kind of games again I
think it's really really worthwhile
having and obviously there aren't the
classics right you know general I love
love love Jenga there's ping pong
there's food tables at mini food tables
I wanted to bring one in this video but
they literally sold out but I can't get
the food table by link in the
description bar below
there's also sling shot I bought a sling
shot for my little nephew last year and
basically he was growing balls at every
Mondrian Christmas but I really like
games and there's two games I picked up
the IQ challenge test you're great
matter to the or limits and it's
basically like questions and answers
where you can see how smart you are
there during Christmas time we do get
very competitive and it's a lot of fun I
also like the game what is it called
articulate I love and I love what's the
game that we play I can't remember the
name we pray we get mad emotional like
its doors close and everybody is
screaming I think it's articulate I know
what it's like and Families guys and
girls they're all very competitive we
all fit with the smartest this is the
way to generally see if that is the case
and after that there's a game here
called gender Wars Mars and Venus
collide in the old
showdown and I another it's another kind
of competition game you know boys versus
girls
gender questions and during Christmas
this is when we love to do games like
this it gets emotional it gets
competitive in war but it's good-looking
it's Christmastime you know this is
always about love and it's a great way
to kill it and I think this is just a
great gift to get a guy / just to have
for the entire family you know so the
next category is photography and tech
and obviously it can be very expensive
you can go and buy tripods you can buy
cameras you can buy lenses you can buy
it really expensive things but I wanted
to keep this a little bit more
affordable and I wanted to give some
inspiration versus say go spend 400
pounds on a new camera or that I could
do that if you want to see my actual
camera recommendations but I wanted to
think of little things that you could do
that were affordable number one thing I
thought was really cool is obviously a
selfie lens now it's not just for you to
say selfie it's a lens you can actually
attach to your phone to basically expand
how much your phone can see and also the
quality of your pictures and you
basically clip it on you base it you
clip it on to your phone and it just has
a wider field of vision I think that
anyone who loves taking photos with
their cameras that you are ordering if
you can get these little attachments and
there's so many ones that you can buy to
put onto your phone and just give it
some extra pizzazz it's really welcomed
about having to spend a ton of money
after that I've got boombox
speakers these are portable speakers
that you're attached to your phone it
amplifies sound so you get more sound
out of your phone you don't need to plug
it in you don't need any electricity
it's just the battery and you can use it
for iPhones four and five this one but
I'm sure they have it for like sixes and
sevens but it depends you can buy it for
your different phone types and it's
basically a speaker dock there's loads
of different speaker dogs this is one I
found on the site I think it's a great
and affordable present to give to
someone
both of these are a bit more of stocking
fillers to be honest with you
but they're really good for anyone who's
a camera fan I have a younger cousin
actually he's probably 18 now he's
really into cameras he studies
photography and obviously I'm not going
to necessarily buy him a new camera
right now I'm gonna go and spend 800
pounds or something like that
instead I could get him a book all about
cameras to give him some inspiration
this book's called cover crazy and it's
basically all about different cameras or
silo cameras and again I think it's just
about a bit more inspiration so next up
we have the classics which is clothing
and accessories and do feel like it is a
little bit hard to get people clothing
unless you know specifically what they
want or you are the one who's bias or
they're all you have amazing style they
love everything you do and I think at
Christmas it's a little bit hard to do
that rather you get people gift vouchers
should they buy their own yet but I
think I was couple of things that you
can always buy for someone that they'll
genuinely like so number one it's
servant trainers now whoever's in your
life might know a specific pair of
trainers that they like or you might
like their style but I saw these on
Azoff and I thought they were amazing
I love Mikey I think you guys might know
that and these are the air max toy box
which I feel like a a kind of masculine
version of the air max fears and I love
the fact that it's kind of leather and
suede it's like a combo and the color is
absolutely gorgeous I had to pick these
up for Mike because I just thought they
were amazing and me and him complete
winning I've got my my blue air max ears
and he can wear these and we can be
twins is that really corny
yeah probably is really actually after
that you can't go wrong with a Christmas
jumper or a knitted sweater I know lots
of people's grandmas didn't it then
Michaels grandma is the pivot Natasha
she does hats scarves and gloves jumpers
take along
but we do usually get a knitted piece
from her and she's very excited to be
meeting some goodies for the baby coming
I think she really said she's got some
stuff but I love a knitted jumper oh my
god like this is so cute I'm probably
going to steal it from Mike anyway but I
do think a lovely Christmas jumper is
nice to get someone eyes open novelty
what I was like genuinely you need to
wear this on Christmas Day hello or
Boxing Day and knitted jumper like this
and ezel's has so many really really
nice words that are just gorgeous and
handsome or just lovely they make you
feel warm inside but if you want
something that someone can make me wear
all year round
obviously like February January really
cold so I also picked up this red dark
red or should say burgundy knitted
jumper which i think is absolutely
gorgeous and Michael really likes this
color and it suits him and I know that
absolutely loves it moving on to
accessories there are definitely some
key things that you can get the guys in
your life number one are socks and I
thought these stocks were super cool and
obviously I like things that are a bit
more dramatic clearly but you can get a
guy playing black spots playing red
starts patting soft creamy soft
Christmas off there's so many such
options check out the sock hot shot
little hard to say check out the stock
options in the description box but I
really liked the coloring because it's
kind of like mustard and a blue and I
think that these are things birthdays in
Christmas that guys genuine when you
actually need socks boxers they need
these in droves
please okay but also you can give a guys
something like this which is a woman and
belt set I think this is a gift that you
can give a guy over any age and
especially things like your belts and
well it's they're not something that
maybe a guy would get regularly I think
if you get a really high quality one
he'll really appreciate it they do have
designer ones on the site as well so
they've got you go boss then it got some
10th Baker's some other ones but this is
a Lowe's own brand and it's 40 pounds
for the belt and for the wallet
that's actually amazing I don't know if
this has got a coin section but who has
the coin section nowadays I don't know I
don't think anyone does and also things
are like necklace gloves especially if
you live in England it gets really
really cold nowadays so if you can get a
guy some really gorgeous gloves he would
definitely appreciate that so guys that
is the end of my men's gift guide I hope
you found it affordable and useful and
