probably tell might look a bit different
I am in a hotel room right now Mike and
I decided to go on in the old holiday
well we didn't just decide we booked a
holiday to LA we're in the USA and came
and we visited our friends ray and Eric
as well as just taking a little break
and also having a couple of meetings out
here as well but obviously I had to come
shopping I'm gonna do a us a haul I
actually didn't plan on doing this miles
decide man I've got shopping let me do a
quick call and you guys know that I love
doing video so I was like I've got all
this stuff it's gonna get packed in my
suitcases so while it's all fresh you
know I don't know what's gonna happen
I'm gonna show you the things I've got
cuz there's so many nice things out here
brands that we don't necessarily have at
home as well as I don't know it's just
nice to pick up things that you forget
about when you're back at home right
first things first is Victoria Secret
Victoria's Secret at home but I just
wanted to pick up some stuff here so I
just picked up a couple of brides you
don't really need to see all of them but
this is the multi way bra and it's a
plain bra
most of the bars that I get are usually
plain and black or nude just because I
got time for patterned and crazy
underwear but I really thought I needed
a really good multi way bra and I don't
really have one this one wasn't on the
special offer or anything like that so
it was $49 which I do think is expensive
for a bra but I think it's just a really
good high-quality bra and I've heard a
lot about it they do have the two for 49
so I obviously wanted to pick up a
couple more and I said I don't really
wear crazy underwear I don't like I just
decided to pick up just a purple one and
like a this kind of Aztec print here is
well they're both from the pink range
and they're and they're just really nice
they're like t-shirt bras and I love it
when there's nothing on it
so when you wear a tight top or
something you won't be able to see like
all the lace and do
on it as well and I bought like some
matching underwear to go that the purple
one I can imagine me wearing the purple
one all the time but yeah this is a lot
but the purple matches that it was
really nice I don't know it's cuz I'm in
LA it's making me feel like getting my
crazy colors and then a good thing is I
got a free Victoria's Secret umbrella
with my purchase and they say I've had
the really long ones but I was like I
can't take really no one in my suitcase
I was like I'll just go for a little one
and I thought that was really really
nice I'm not quite sure where I got it
but they said with your purchase today
you get free umbrella white American
accent so bad so I finally went to North
dreamer I know that sounds really sad
I've never been to know this room before
but I went in there it's basically like
Selfridges or has a Fraser it's just a
department store but and they had a
special offer on Mac and I don't have
the MAC eyeshadow warm neutrals palette
and I've always really really wanted
this and they had it for I believe it
was like $89 so it's cheaper than even
in the MAC store right probably about
ten to fifteen dollars but that's still
a bargain right and so I bought the warm
neutrals palette it's the 15 pieces it's
such a cool of gorgeous gorgeous palaces
lots of nice colors that I would wear
all the time if you guys know me you
know that I am a pallet kind of girl and
I don't really like wearing it or our
eyeshadow it's but I would definitely
wear every color that's in here so I was
like yes I need this I love this isn't
buff and in Nordstrom
it's cheaper than even in the MAC store
so that was a bargain I didn't actually
buy anything else in there
so I also went to Melrose Avenue and
there's an arse like Proust or there and
the lady said there's only six in the
USA so it was quite exciting that I was
able to go into this full-blown amazing
mass store it just had everything or the
women look gorgeous in there I won't
move ray as well and basically the
ladies in there are so nice they know
their stuff and there's so convincing I
basically ended up buying the contour
kabuki brush it's good that it talked of
the ITA or the
it's a kabuki brush and basically it's a
contouring brush I'd never heard about
this but Ray was like very excited like
oh my gosh nice brush it's amazing it's
basically a contour brush that means
that you don't even have to blend or
anything this brush is expensive I
didn't realize how expensive the
brushless till it went off at the till
and it was like you spend $98 that's
like I already put a brush in the
lipstick Oh
this brush is fifty five dollars and
that's a lot for a brush but supposedly
it's a magic brush and I was sold and
the women were so nice and this is a
really cool brush I bought it so this is
the brush here I will let you know how
it goes I'll probably do a tutorial
using it and I'll let you know if I
really think it's worth it look like
they were raving about this brush like
it is like your life changing the may
also bought a lipstick in the colour
called Dominique it is a gorgeous
gorgeous movie kind of violent Matt and
the color is exclusive to those pro
stores so I believe that they saw oh my
gosh it's so beautiful it's more
beautiful than I remember I'm gonna did
some blog pictures right now this is hot
oh my gosh I don't even want to use it
oh my gosh so this is an exclusive color
to those stores so I love it it's
gorgeous and I'm gonna let you know how
it goes I'll probably do like a full
face wearing something like this so
after that I went to Sephora obviously I
was so excited to go to Sephora why
don't we have a Sephora in England
somebody tell me why Sephora come on
hook us up it's so nice in there is
literally like yeah it's not that I just
bought things that we didn't have at
home it's just things that I felt like I
needed so I basically bought a new
beauty blender I think this is the
miniature one because this seems smaller
than my normal one although it's saying
original Beauty Blender I don't know
this seems smaller than mine but I
bought a beauty blender because
Marilyn's literally dead and these are
amazing I do really like them then I
finally picked up myself a Kat Von D
liquid lipstick
the color love which is kind of like a
vibrant vibrant purple it's beautiful
everybody's like an Instagram wearing it
there were a couple of other colors that
I wanted but literally they're sold out
in every store but this is a gorgeous
gorgeous color and it's my first cat 1d
piece and yeah I also picked up a
Sephora own brand nip stick I don't know
what this color is called it's got a
number it's got 5:04 e on it but it's
basically a lovely lovely brown and I
tried it on my hand I thought you know
this is gonna be really nice I'm trying
to make brown lips work for me but
they're it's hard out here you know when
you're already brown when you have brown
lips sometimes you look a little bit
like um well you look a bit sick but
we're gonna see if we can make this work
I also saw this brand it's tartars
Daley's essentials natural anti-aging
skin care discovery kit now I don't know
what it was but it was something to do
with like that I liked the ethos of this
brand I don't know who it is I don't
know who Titus is but maybe it's just
the packaging and everything maybe we
want to buy it I think it's an organic
and plant-based skincare range and I
really like plant-based skin care ranges
and when it says anti-aging I think it's
important to start using anti-aging
products and you don't start using them
when you have wrinkles or when you have
you know blemishes start using them well
before them if you're like 21 to 25 you
should definitely be using this kind of
stuff because it's gonna really help and
this was like miniatures of everything
in the range so I wanted to try it and
see what I thought about each of the
different products in has and then put
an Urban Decay gloss in the color called
rules 34 do you know I've had this
before I realize and I really like it
it's a nice brown gloss and magnet
glosses so I went to the nasty girl
store can you believe that nasty girl
has a store I never knew that they had
stores I knew that one line and stuff
and the only thing is I really felt like
it was really expensive I don't know why
whisperings they're not watching or
anything like that but I just felt like
it was expensive but clothing is curated
beautifully I love the collection and
the style of things that they have
in there but it is quite expensive
however you can find a good bargain and
if you're smart like me you know how to
find a bargain
so I'm realistically I'm a dress car I
will always be a dress car and a girly
girl sad to think that it suits my body
shape a lot more but this dress here
it's this gorgeous body corner polo neck
dress it is like MIDI all the way down
to the calf and all the way fitted I
picked up an extra small cuz I just
wanted them extra and it's just such a
pretty pretty dress
this was $34 this was like the cheapest
thing in the whole store okay and I know
how I found it like they hide their self
things or things are half-price like
they hide them in normal price clothes
so you would never know so I was sifting
through the world I thought oh this is
gorgeous and I thought it's gonna be
really expensive and it was not exciting
$4 I think that's actually a bargain I
then went to a place called Kitson and
it just has a lots of little pick kitsch
things and stuff like that but um I
basically bought the Mario Badescu
skincare I bought the acne facial
cleanser I don't have acne but I do have
pores that getting large you guys know
this and this contains salicylic acid in
it I've heard lots of reviews I've seen
Claire Marshall talk about this line and
some of these products so that's one of
the reasons why I really was like I'm
going to just try this stuff I feel
excited and motivated to try new things
so I bought the acne facial cleanser and
the seaweed night cream because I'm
obsessed with moisturizers my
collections getting flow big and then I
also got the drying lotion I've heard a
lot about this you shake it up for
whenever you get a blemish and I do get
blemishes from time to time I'm just
gonna pop this on it and see what
difference it makes
but finally I bought some cos lip balms
I bought these that a couple of years
back when I was in New York the last
time they're really really good they
smell delicious and make your lips feel
super moist I've got the watermelon and
passion fruit so yeah though I also
picked up some bits
American Apparel I know when last video
I moaned about how it's been since Merck
and the power is I still think it is I
wanna be on the beach and stuff like
that but I'll be honest with you I don't
feel that comfortable in a bikini I
don't have the flattest stomach in the
world and I don't know I've gotten a
little bit bigger since like January I
was working on being really fit and
stuff like that and so I just feel so
uncomfortable just with my belly out and
I was looking everywhere for swimsuits
literally no one sells full-body
swimsuits
everyone wants anyone to be rocking a
bikini it's not everyday bikini anyway
American Apparel toys really nice
Baywatch style swimsuits you know I see
it some people in a darkness anyway so I
decided that I wanted some swimsuits so
I picked up this really nice red one v
it is really flattering and if you've
got a bit more of a Billy honestly
swimsuit look really gorgeous we don't
have to always wear a bikini and I'm not
wearing bikinis anymore swimsuit every
day so I bought the swimsuit in the red
and then they had this one that was like
the American flag and I know it's a bit
cringy but I just felt like you know
what I'm just gonna buy it
it's nice I'm a tourist I'm allowed to
wear this and people really liked it on
Instagram and I felt really cool just
wearing this American flag I'm sorry
guys maybe on Labor Day I'm allowed to
bring it back out or something but I
just wore it took them a couple of
pictures but more or less I would more
wear you know this plain red one which
is totally Baywatch and I just like it
and it fits really well it's a little
bit high on the crease so you need to be
fully fully waxed you know fully fully
clear in that area otherwise you could
have a little bit of a shell of the bush
finally I went to pack Sun packs on is
not the store that we have and at home
and I walked in and I was like this cut
it gives me a brandy melville vibe it
really does and they sell brandy
melville there as well as some other
brands really nice basics really casual
and cool like ripped jeans and t-shirts
and what kind of style vests
perfect weenie nice and quite affordable
but depending on which brand you pick up
I picked up quite a few bits I just
basically bought lots of long line
t-shirt there are lots of these long
line t-shirts we've had which have the
split down the middle and I just tie in
the front I've already worn one of these
already I just love it when it's got the
split down the side and it just looks
great with jeans or shorts so this is
just it kind of and I just bought this
mess here what I love about this vest is
the neck kind it's a really nice
neckline this isn't that my favorite
kind of neckline it's kind of high but
it also comes in kind of like a racer
mask and then this is from PacSun but
the brand is called la hearts it is a
high neckline again comes in other
sleeves and it's also split as well so I
love this flip detail oh my gosh I think
everything split detail everything split
detail sorry guys and then I just picked
up this green tea I've been loving
wearing more color and then a bit color
girl from now on like it just makes me
feel better and feel happier and I think
it's pretty ok I may be not that cool
but I'm wearing color so I picked up
this pennant greeny tea as well this is
also a nice little green tea as well
it's curved at the bottom but if you
guys can see that it's nicely curved at
the bottom and it has some split detail
as well so it's really pretty and then I
bought this little vest which is Pat no
Lee brand and it's just like that it's
got a little tie on the front as well
you might see that I've got this little
gold detail tattoo thing on my arm I
actually bought this from Sephora as
well my guys that is my mini USA haul
it's really nice to just come here and
get some few extra bits that I wouldn't
normally get I never plan to do this
video and I was like I'm gonna edit this
upload this and put it out today so I
hope you guys enjoyed and I will catch
you soon I'm really sorry that I never
did a meet-up and I'm not actually
vlogging and because I just thought I'd
like to just enjoy my time with my loved
ones if I be completely honest with you
we worked really hard and I enjoy my
relate my relationships are so important
to me
be it my friendships with people and
obviously my husband and my family
see my sister who's staying in Florida
she's just having a new baby and stuff
like that so I didn't want to
necessarily vlog it all but I am putting
a lot of things on my snapchat and stuff
like that and you know my God's grace
I'll be able to do a proper meetup maybe
also with a brand because I just don't
know how to organize that stuff out here
and it's a little bit nerve-wracking if
I be honest with you but nevertheless I
love you all and thank you so much for
watching I'll catch you guys later bye
that people in a darkness afraid to come
into the light some people need I don't
know a way to help somebody that's gonna
be there I mean I know you fear No don't
