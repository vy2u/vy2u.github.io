on my face is particularly large today
because I've got an epic haul for you
today so you're going to need to sit
down and get yourself a cup of tea
because this is a good one and I love it
because they are coming into the autumn
season which means you can go ham on
like cozy things and jacket and I looked
at this collection that I have here and
I was like oh my gosh I've gone crazy on
jacket which is what I do every year cuz
jackets are my favorite thing especially
if you are wearing basic outfits like
make sure your jacket is on fleek and
then you're gonna look amazing
so yeah I feel like I've got loads here
to show you some great bits of Azar's
misguided and like a sneaky little
design a piece at the end I feel like
I'm gonna sneak a designer piece in
every single hole at the very end but
like I love it and everything I haven't
linked in the description bar below for
those asking me where's the item from I
get that where's the item from all the
time it's in the description box a lot
of the times but I know I'm bad as well
so I'm sorry I'm not even going to tell
anyone off but yeah I hope you guys
enjoyed this haul happy watching get
your notepad or your pen your notepad
your notepad and your pen and yeah I
hope you guys I love in this so first
things first I'm gonna start off with
the items that I have from a sauce so
I've got a ton of jackets here the first
one I have is this denim jacket and what
I love about it is that it's got
shearing on the inside now right now
it's a little bit too hot or too warm to
wear shearing but I know that a jacket
like this is going to sell out so fast
and you're not going to be able to get
it right later on in winter and last
year I was waiting for a coat with faux
shearing and they were so expensive
because I waited till it was like the
dead of winter to buy them and I'm not
going to do it this side this year and I
actually love the shape of this jacket
it's like an oversized denim jacket and
this shearing is like oh so so cool I
don't think I've actually shown this
jacket in a hole before but it isn't
actually new so I'm not going to pretend
that it's new in but I wanted to show it
to you because eggs do have it on their
website and it's basically a reclaimed
vintage
my jacket and this jacket has been my
everything and I'm absolutely loving it
for winter and I just realized I've
never shown it in a haul so I wanted to
show it to you anyway okay so another
one y'all know that I'm obsessed with my
leather jacket I love them I have a H&amp;amp;M
leather jacket that I've had for four
years and I bring it out every single
year best practice matching them ever
like I love it but you know you got to
change it up switch it out what's in the
world and I got this one and initially
when I opened it up I was like I'm not
sure about this one on everything on
life so nice and the sheering is well on
the collar it's not in the arms sadly
but it's good enough like to keep you
warm and cozy during the winter because
I know that sometimes leather jackets
are not that warm you have to layer them
up but this one is this one's gorgeous I
love it
and then as being a little north tee
this is a pink biker jacket style jacket
from Azores and this one is just badass
I love it as well I were on my snap my
snap is what's my snap what's my stuff
yeah my starts Patricia brightest I
always forget my snap but yeah I wore my
snap everyone was asking for links for
it so this is it he in a whole video and
it's just a little cheeky one that is
just gorgeous it's it's not made of
March it's quite thin but it's not you
know ridiculously expensive and I feel
like you can wear this as a transitional
piece I love it so also bought some tops
and stuff that are a little bit more
Ottoman or Forli and I didn't go for
like the purple colors but I went for
some of the styles that I'm really
loving right now
I bought this kind of polo next sweater
but what I absolutely love are the
sleeves these are super on trend the
kind of flutes Ybor the trumpet sleeve
and like the ruffles and I thought this
was super cute without overdoing the
trend and I bought it in the white as
well as the black as well and I was like
I always wear a polo neck like each
winter it's totally necessary and these
two were just gorgeous and then I bought
two basic vests one in black one in
white but I like the white one because
it had like the red and the blue um
detail on it and I know it's a probably
a little bit too summery to wear this
now but I mean it's one of those casual
pizzas that you can just throw on at any
point in time and
I love it I check these two hours play
oh and this one is the black one I don't
actually think they're from the same
range to be honest but this is from the
tall range so it actually fits a little
bit like a dress and what I like I don't
if you can see it's got these like black
shiny stripes as well it's very sports
luxe it's kind of really rich and I'm I
loved it I thought I looked a little bit
edgy you know all right
this t-shirt here I thought it was so
cute like wifey I wanted to teach it
with a logo in it and I was like well
some of them are really expensive like
40 pounds for a logo t-shirt no but this
all was like 15 pounds and had wifey on
it and I was like yeah I like this one
and I love the color and the fit is
really nice like I want to like refresh
my basic so having t-shirts and vests
and stuff is necessary once in a while
to get some new ones so I wanted just
that this item here is the most
beautiful dress and I wanted something
really nice and elegant and for one of
my looks for Fashion Week and this is a
self-portrait dress so it's on the
pricey side but I just thought that this
is just a beautiful piece and I really
am a big fan of self-portrait and what I
find is that yes it's more expensive but
the price point is definitely for that
goal who wants to buy herself something
a little bit extra special it's not
ridiculously out of her range but it's
you know a price point on that day where
you're like I'm gonna spoil myself a
little bit this is just the perfect one
and I love this color and the little
cutout details and my stomach's kind of
getting almost on the flat flat hay
which means I can have a little bit of
cutout detail as well but if you've got
a special occasion or wedding or
something that you want something pretty
for this dress here lovely and then just
a couple more basics I got this t-shirt
and it says new look because as us
actually sells new look and I really
loved the like t-shirt with the vest
over it kind of style and I wanted this
team because and then I've got other
shift dresses that I was gonna wear
underneath this is like the perfect
shape tee for that look and then I
bought this this top not you know what I
don't know if any of you guys for um
follow like Joanne the scammer
and I'm just like you know this is so
Joanne the scammer ish I feel like I
could just come a few old men in the
like with my Shivani shiny silky sleeves
that are kind of wide and gorgeous I
didn't have a plan for it but I was just
like kind of like it and the mink pink
is just my color and it just feels kind
of sexy but I think I'm gonna wear it
with like high-waisted trousers maybe
try and make her look for Fashion Week
I'm not sure but I thought like it was
the kind of piece I wanted to have in my
closet that was just you know sumptuous
yes and then this here is like oh my
gosh it's a naughty purchase because it
is expensive for what it is and it is a
standout piece and I might end up
returning it and not even sure but I
just wanted to show it to you guys
anyway this jacket here is just
beautiful
and I'm not someone who really follows
trends or anything but there's a massive
embroidery trend and I wanted a really
cool standout piece for Fashion Week and
I felt like this was genuinely it it's
so well made and like Topshop has one
which is like double the price I've seen
so many other places with like leather
jackets or or suede jackets with the
embroidery and they're very expensive
and this was probably the best price one
that is actually ever found so I mean it
is a bit of an extra piece but I'm
loving it
and I would like pair it with something
super cheap like super super cheap but I
love this but the next items I have are
from misguided and it's literally just
this dress and the camel dress here and
I don't really shop on misguided as much
as I used to for some odd reason because
I always used to find that items are
very hit-or-miss when it comes to the
quality and their price is going up and
up and the quality isn't necessary but
some days when they hit it they hit it
so good you have to buy the item in two
colors so I got the dress in the camel
this camel here and I put it like on my
Instagram it's like a button-down dress
I'm a also got in the black and I just
thought it was absolutely fun tabulous
like off the shoulder ribbed sexy made
my curves look good I was loving it so
I've got the black and the camel the
only thing I will say is that the
buttons pop open so you either need to
go I think you need to probably go a
size up and just be careful because
you'll be walking and the next thing
you'll notice that the button right by
your coach your crotch is just basically
boom wide open
your knickers are on show for everyone
yes that's already happened to me on a
number of occasions with this outfit but
still I'm not going to lie it's so
flattering and so many people ask me
about the link to this it was crazy and
this top isn't like new from my most
recent recent purchase but I don't think
I ever showed it in a hole and it's this
off the shoulder top that is cropped and
everybody asks me about this top over
and over and over again they wanted
links all links are in the description
bar below people every single link we
get purchasing please spend your money
but yeah this is in the description bar
below and I just wanted to show it with
to you guys
so basically cropped and like thrilled
and then off the shoulder as well which
is my dream style so next up I have this
gorgeous dress from glamorous and I feel
like I keep going to the glamorous site
to go and buy bits and bobs and whenever
I'm there I always find something that's
a little bit different to what you see
on everybody else's website and you'll
find that trends come and go but I do
feel like they have bits that are a bit
more unique which I really like and are
super affordable and then this dress
here was just a fan tabulous you can see
the through details at the bottom and
the neckline is just just fabulous
like honestly if you see this dress on
it's gorgeous so gorgeous I love all the
detail on it and I think it's going to
be really nice for like the party season
if you're looking for a cocktail dress
or special occasion this one here love
it right next up I've got some things on
my baby's all river I learned you guys
know I love me some river island and I
have this gorgeous kind of cocky blazer
with these gold buttons and I think it's
just a really nice blazer to throw on
like a black vest and black jeans and
what I really liked is that it has this
really cool split detail at the black
back here which is just really
flattering and just gorgeous and like
trendy and sexy and fabulous and oh so
chic and I just feel like this is such a
nice fitting blazer because it doesn't
have collars and often I don't like
colors because they look a little bit
bulky and then these genes have been
jeans that I've been living
and I think with our Islands got a new
collection of denim basically so they've
got lots of different styles of jeans
they've got jeans of like the
whatchamacallit like logos and bits and
bobs on it and then high-waisted jeans
different cuts of genes and different
styles of jeans and this is like a super
distressed pair of jeans and the
distressing on this is like my ideal
distressing you know sometimes you can
get distressed jeans and they didn't
quite get the distress right like it's
just one slit and it doesn't look quite
kosher this one here the distress on it
is so good it's perfect and then I have
this skirt which is just my favorite
it's this gorgeous camel knit skirt
which is long length with a split like
yes you're making me so so happy love
love love this skirt but the color is
just everything
I really wish there's a matching jumper
there is not a matching jumper so
annoying but I'm just gonna work with
like a white t-shirt or another jumper
but this here
this here is my autumn goals like autumn
style goals okay so next up I've got
some items from H&amp;amp;M and I actually
bought four things from H&amp;amp;M online gasps
I didn't even know that H&amp;amp;M you can
actually buy stuff online I thought you
could view online but I've never ever
ever ever bought anything from H&amp;amp;M
online just because I had heard bad
things about it as well or that it's
really slow or that half the suits not
on there so I'm always going to store
but there are some great bits that I
found such as this polo neck jumper here
in this beautiful burgundy color which
has got the flute sleeves that I'm
loving this season like absolutely
loving and it's a really nice quality
jumper out actually say it's better
quality than the UM azo swan but I'm the
massive fan and I love the neck detail
as well gorgeous and I'm just gonna say
get this jacket while it's still here I
don't even I don't know if it's going to
be here anymore look I told you first
link in the description box guys know
what there's no there's no words I'm
just I'm just gonna be silent
I shopped everywhere last year for a
shearing jacket ended up buying a crap
one from like China on my eBay and it
was just all for quality
I spent my hundred and thirty pounds on
it and it was just poor quality this one
on the other hand in the flesh I will
vouch and say people amazing so in love
guys I love this this was sent to me by
M &amp;amp; Co they sent grace a bunch of items
and then there's You cheeky bits I saw
NS like that I actually wanted and this
came over for me and it's a gorgeous
kind of Jala with a faux fur you know
color and I love a faux fur color and
this is just gorgeous to just throw on a
jeans outfit and a little white tee and
I think it's a really nice transitional
piece I want to say say thank you to
those guys for sending it to me and I
thought I'd just let you all know but
it's just absolutely gorgeous and this
is like a thick wall as well it's just
fabulous like I love it they also sent
me this black jacket as well which is
just a longline duster jacket with a
gorgeous belt so next up I bought just a
few bits from Topshop and I'm not gonna
lie I did like a whole massive horn
online and then I ended up keeping only
two things that I absolutely love I'm
not quite sure why I'm just that kind of
person like unless I love la blah blah
blah vit I'm not keeping it like I'm
just not wasting my money like that
being half and half about things but it
was this camel jumper it is so pretty it
is so pretty it's like a faux velvet and
then it's got just this really nice
neckline and it's really slouchy and I
love it and I think I'm gonna pair it
with that knit skirt that I had from
River Island but I just love the like
faux velvet I mean not for a little bit
did I say for velvet I don't even know
what that is is that such a thing but
yeah I like the velvet texture
I love the camel color this is a hundred
percent my casual style and Ike it's
gorgeous
would look good with like a slouchy
skirt as well as jeans as well and then
I bought myself this heels and I'm not
gonna lie
Topshop do amazing heels that copy like
designers
picked up these which look so much
better on than off they are gorgeous
these are just the best pair of thick
block heel sandals which I feel like I'm
going to wear every day during Fashion
Week
big fan for my splurge I ended up
picking up a JW Anderson bag and I've
been wanting one of these for the
absolute longest I think it's absolutely
beautiful and for a designer bag it's a
really nice entry price point and I feel
that I started to buy designer bags that
are a bit more you know on the smaller
side and less expensive side of the
scale so I can have a better collection
I remember when I like bought my Chanel
and my Celine and they were like I'm the
really high end of the price point but
you only get to buy a 1 1 signe or
something like that I feel like it's
much easier to buy designer when you go
for the smaller items in their
collection I think I'm going to do a
video on like how to dress expensive
like on a budget at some point in time
so if you like the idea of a video like
that then I'm happy to do it I'm in love
with this bag I've really been wanting
it for ages and you know I think it's
just gorgeous and elegant and will last
me for a very long time so guys that is
the end of my haul I hoped you enjoyed
that video I'm like in love with so many
items that I've got and I hope you guys
like them and you get inspired and maybe
you buy some links Agenor I realized
about haul videos sometimes they're a
little bit can constant about
consumerism but when I'm buying stuff
online I'm not gonna lie I might
thinking all my subscribers might like
that and I might think that items are
bargain that items so cool that I want
to buy the item so I can show you
so hopefully you get to buy it before it
sells out and stuff like that and it's
so crazy how my mind now work right when
I'm shopping I don't just shop for me
I'm like I'm shopping for all of us
girls I'm shopping for all of us and
everything is linked in the description
bar so you guys can have a happy
shopping experience that is so much
easier so I hope you guys like it and I
will catch you in my next video
