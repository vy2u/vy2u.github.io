today I'm about to do an epic oh yeah
this hole is about to be major and they
make sure for me because I nowadays do
holes that have a little bit smaller and
I wanted to do 25 pounds and under haul
but you know what I what it wasn't
possible because there are so many
amazing things that were just over the
fresh hole but everything is between the
price of 25 pounds and 45 pounds and
under 25 pounds as well so I've got yard
all covered over there and I'm gonna
call this like the last of summerhall
because it's August now and today it's
raining like who knows what tomorrow be
how stoning the day after that it will
be sunshine whatever you know up you
just have to roll with it when you live
in England or just go on holiday a lot
more and I hope you guys like some of
the items that I have I will have links
all in the description bar below if you
want to get buying and yeah as I always
say get comfortable and get a cup of tea
so the first items I'm quickly going to
show you are from boohoo and I'm not
gonna lie with you booth who is one of
those stores that is very much hid in a
Miss and so I will not really bite a bag
of tons of items and then most of it
just doesn't get kept all wrong because
I find that the quality is just a little
bit or it looks nice in the pictures but
you've received the item and it's not
all that and I really hope that they
work on that and changing it but they do
have some pieces that are amazing and
this set that I'm wearing is gorgeous
which is basically this top with the
tire along with the wide leg trousers
and I think these trousers are really
great for like the holiday time and
they're just a gorgeous pair they're
really loose they're really floating I
feel like they look absolutely great on
the beach I love them so much that I
actually break them in the black as well
so you can kinda see what the top
actually looks like it looks really nice
and really sexy and I think you can like
tie the top however you think suits your
body the most and then it also has the
oversize trousers as well so this top I
got as well it's basically an oversized
shirt in the pajama style and I'm loving
pajama style shirts and I think they're
nice oversized really great for the
summer and I think they look really
great with shorts as well so I bought
some items from Topshop as well and
funny thing I used to shop at Topshop
all the time and but I don't shop there
as much as I used to because I shop more
online and I for some reason I don't
like using top shop online and but I
will use Topshop online more because
whenever I do receive this stuff I
really do like it and I have this green
top here and I don't know I think this
top was 15 pounds and it is a bit
expensive but it's a really nice top
it's really flattering looks great in
the moobs just a casual piece to have in
your summer wardrobe to throw on with
denim and after that I bought more jeans
and I find that Topshop jeans are the
jeans that suit me the most and
particularly the Jamie jeans and the mum
jeans and all that kind of stuff they
look the best on me if I do say so
myself
but they're like my favorite fitting
jeans and I picked these they are kind
of in a nice like bright blue denim but
what I really liked was the ends and I
don't have you seen that people are
wearing like lots of free jeans at the
end and I really like those and I like
the fact that it had the kind of frayed
Fresno's or down the sign aside I think
that really suited me and there were
just a really nice flattering pair of
denim jeans the jeans are 40 pounds but
they are a little pricey and but they're
totally worth it I wear my Jamie jeans
for like three years like flat
standardly so um yeah this top here
loads of people who are loving the
detail at the front thank you it is a
Topshop top and it's more like a little
piece that goes around the body as well
so I next went to H&amp;amp;M and I stopped
shopping and H&amp;amp;M for so long and they
just went back and I was like H&amp;amp;M is
actually the boss like it's so good
really affordable and really um trendy
as well I've got this across the
shoulder top here and it's in blue and
white
white is currently a big favor of mine
and there's also another one that was
wearing in another video and people kept
asking me what was from that top is also
from H&amp;amp;M and this is just a ruched over
the shoulder top and it is $12.99 and
then I also bought these denim jeans and
again I never buy jeans from H&amp;amp;M but
these just look so good on me and I love
the extra detailing I find that my jeans
are so boring but these had just this
patch and stuff by the knee and leg area
and I just thought it was really cool
and really my style so next up I got
some items from ASOS and I'm sorry
they're not in the 25 pound range frilly
items are more than that because they're
from ASOS white and some of the other
brands but they're still really good and
I wanted to share them with you anyway
so I have this top here and it's from
let rare London I've really been liking
rare London because they just create
some items that are really nice quite
sexy quite form-fitting but maybe a bit
thicker than some of the other materials
that I've worn in the past and I love
the kind of floral detail across the
bust I think it's super sexy I seem to
be liking all things camel and I have
this crop swing top swing top I sort of
try to say that like five times I've got
this cropped swing top and it is a
coordinate in say that G got shorts with
it but I didn't get the shorts I wish I
did and I probably would pick them up
later anyway and this top is 15 pounds
and I really like swim tops because I
kind of hang off my boobies that are a
little bit larger and they're really
comfortable as well so as I said I'm
loving loose pajama restyled tops and
this one is gorgeous this is 34 pounds
it's a little bit pricey but the
material is on a 10 especially if you
wear something like this to work or to
college or something
it's like worth the money because it's
such good quality it's not like cheapy
awful material it's a gorgeous satin and
I love the color and the color blocking
as well now this top here is a splurge
is a splurge and it is from the 8th of
Wight collection but it is made of denim
really high quality and
it's amazing and it's one of those
pieces that will just be in your closet
it's this top here with this cutout
shoulder and I just love the shape it
just looks so elegant and it will look
gorgeous with the white pair of skinny
jeans it's just it's just bath it's just
amazing this is actually 45 pounds but
it's worth it because of the quality so
next up add some items from misguided
and they're willing the 25 pounds 245
pounds range the first thing I have are
these high-waisted suede trousers and I
was genuinely inspired by being on like
it sounds really corny but when I went
to her concert she wore a lot of Brown
and swathe and I loved the fact that it
was textured and I thought let me just
slip into into it by wearing one of
these that are a little bit cheaper than
actually going for a real suede
items and it feels really nice I don't
know how this is going to wash or look
so I will keep you informed but I think
it is buff after that I picked up this
white blazer and I thought is a really
good quality blazer it looks really nice
the shape is gorgeous and it's like a
long double-breasted blazer and this was
35 pounds and I feel like I'd wear this
with nothing underneath or even like um
what's it called a harness underneath
and then the sway trousers
that's brass that's gorgeous and then I
have this jumpsuit which is gorgeous
it's so summery it's so gorgeous and I
just feel like it's just the nicest
thing ever I love it for like my
holidays that are coming up and I've
always wanted to wear it but I never
find in Reds that I really like until I
found this piece here and it's basically
a tie front dress with just this detail
here I love the shape it's a little bit
of boo boo on show and I feel like this
red really really suits me and looks
good I love a short little fun play
dress to wear during this season I've
also got something similar in the gold
it's kind of tie front but this is a
jumpsuit and I felt like this gold would
just shoot my color like perfectly it's
so nice and I love the colors on it as
well so this jacket I have is from Zara
so many people asking about this I had
it
my on my Instagram this jacket is from
Zara and this jacket cost 40 pounds it
used to be I had 25 pounds and then they
put up the price - they realize how
popping it was and I just feel like it's
a really nice nice jacket and I like to
wear like all black or all one simple
color underneath or like a white t-shirt
throw this on it makes you look like
you're dressed up even if you're not so
next up I got some items from glamorous
and generous is a brand that has always
been around it's always with a source
and it's always in boutique but I never
ever shop on their website but for some
reason there was something that I wanted
that was from glamorous but I couldn't
find it on the asel site and I went to
the glamorous site and I found it and I
just kind of went through all the stuff
that they had and they had a ton of
amazing stuff and actually this does a
really good quality so it's like one of
those things you stumbled on and
remember oh I know glamorous but I never
buy anything from them until like now so
yeah first thing I have is this Swan
style skirt which is so form-fitting and
gorgeous and I love the detailing but it
has it gives me kind of a self-portrait
vibe but without obviously the
self-portrait and price tag it's super
form-fitting and you might need to get a
size up because there is no stretch in
this item but yeah I've got the size 10
and I just think it's so gorgeous after
that I got this white oversize and off
the shoulder top and it looks like I
basically have an obsession with
off-the-shoulder which I kind of
actually do I love the details and I
love all the layers that is on this and
I love the sleeve as well and again this
looks perfect with just blue denim I
also have this dress which is a really
form-fitting dress but it also has the
side cut out details that are really
nice and it really sexy it fits really
well and it goes over the knee and I
find that it's nice of a sexy dress that
shows just a little bit but not
everything finally I have this satin
bomber look at the zip the zip is world
rose gold the Bombers a little small for
me because this is extra small I do need
it in a small but I love satin and I
love
and this is so flattering and nice on
and I love kind of pulling up the seeds
as well to just look a little bit cooler
so finally I have some shoes and I don't
actually know where these shoes are from
because my friend Melissa got these for
me but how gorgeous are these and these
were actually 20 pounds she told me and
I spun and I saw a very similar if not
identical pair in office for 70 pounds
and so I'm going to try and find out
exactly where these are from but the 20
pounds and they look beautiful beautiful
beautiful on and they're actually really
comfortable I'm a massive fan and then I
also have these sandals which I was
wearing all the time when I went away to
Morocco and these are from Aldo and I
just love the simple design on them and
they're so so comfortable on finally I
have a little bit of a splurge item I
have bought myself a mini saline bag and
the reason I got this is that I feel
like I do have a bigger Chanel boy bag
but I feel like I just needed a little
bag I could wear that was a designer bag
like a little run around and this one is
the one that all the bloggers have but
it's so nifty put your phone in it your
card in it maybe your keys in it if you
need to it's just the smallest yo cutest
bag that looks amazing on every outfit
and it's actually really really really
good quality and for anyone who you know
what's the by designer I think this is a
great place to start
it's nice to buy entry level designer
items that aren't extremely expensive so
a normal saline bag it's almost two and
a half to three thousand pounds one of
these is about 600 pounds so for me it
is a snip of a bar pin if you want to
buy a saline item so guys that is the
end of my haul I hope you found it
helpful and useful and I've got all the
links below so do get buying I love it
with you back from my lips please girls
back and yeah hopefully you don't go mad
shopping but I like to share some of the
things that I'm really like in
especially cuz I do blogging and I do a
lot of travel and stuff like that
obviously normal people don't buy as
many items as
I do like let's be totally honest no one
owes as much makeup as a makeup artist
always cut as many clothes as a stylist
but I like to bring to the table some
things that I see in the shops that I
really like that you guys might also
want as well so guys thank you so much
for watching and I will catch you guys
later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
