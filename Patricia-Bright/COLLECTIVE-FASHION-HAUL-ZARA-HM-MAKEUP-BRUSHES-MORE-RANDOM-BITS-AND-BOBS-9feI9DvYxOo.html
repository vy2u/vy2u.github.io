got a haul for you is it forever since I
lost on the whole and stop because I
haven't bought anything I just don't
really like recording halls that much
but yeah I do have something I've got
loads of stuff and want to show you okay
so the first thing I want to show you is
this chain that I got here oh I got
multiple things to show you
so I've got this chain here it's a
really thin really thin you couldn't
even see it
silver chain and I don't know if you
guys know but I actually recently turned
25 and me and my friends like I've got
like four or five best friends close
friends please excuse my nose they're
discussing right now me like we have
birthdays each two week and we like the
closest friends and stuff so I'm
basically but what's all these really
thin silver chain this I put it from hm
Samuel I just let you know I just want a
real silver chain that could be worn all
the time and it's really thin and then I
got this there I'll show you another
piece of jewelry so you guys might have
seen me wear this before but my
parents-in-law as if I was in my mother
and father-in-law to be or Mike's mom
and dad they weren't went to South
Africa over Christmas and they actually
bought me this back and it's this really
cool that traditional chain I don't know
where they got it from I feel they were
in Durban or I don't know one former
village out there and it's really pretty
and I love all the detail and stuff on
it hope you can see this it's like so
beautiful I got that to be honest I
don't get Mike that much stuff on my
birthday because I'm not really a stuff
person I'm more of an experienced person
and Mike took me to go and see Cirque de
Soleil for the totem show at the Royal
Albert Hall so for those of you who
understand what I did that's what I did
it was amazing and then that was a my it
snowed
I was really sweet and romantic and yeah
and we get on the hall oh I got this
from Sedona lace which was I in so
necessary it's the it's basically the
professional brush it with like there's
like 15 brushes in and it comes with
this zip pouch now this is essential for
me I'm so glad I got this because I can
just like look after my brushes and keep
them and I always lose my brushes and my
my other brushes are just looking a bit
rundown now but these are fresh they're
really soft I've been using this but
this goes to work with me on a daily
basis climate bad thing in my face if I
can be bothered to put any makeup on and
its really lovely extremely crazily
crazily soft I'll put a link in the
bottom for anyone who's after getting
like a proper makeup kit I think really
for starting off this is everything that
you could meet and then like this will
last me forever so thank you very much a
Donal ace so let's get onto the curl Vic
I'm always dancing on him let me stop
from Zara please look at this coat
please look at this coat now for those
of you who know I love black and I love
wearing leather and stuff like that and
I do have another coat but my leather
coat has just been like it's getting old
now and I love the quoted one this looks
so Chanel look at this gorgeous this is
from Zara and this was 89 pounds it's
real leather but it's so beautiful and I
got it in a medium it kind of looks like
a biker jacket I just love how quilted
it looks so I bought this dress all I'm
gonna wear this tomorrow to work
actually it's like this what is this
color this teal color dress don't you
could see that's really like cross over
that was 25 pounds and it's again this
season's trend colors are pastures and
baby colors and I love them so sticking
with it I ended up buying this kind of
till shrug top and it's like backbone
really low back and it's the same color
and it's such a lovely fabric material
as well I hope you can see all this
stuff because my camera is a bit crazy
you guys also know that I love you know
Browns and tans and I think this chat
tan jumper cardigan thing and it was
only 15 pounds for this and that's like
literally just throw it on with
something like a little dress or under
my little leather jack here I could just
wear it underneath that pop of color and
I also bought it in like the bright
yellow the lemon color lemons really
trendy and I I always wear muted colors
as
I just want to try something that is a
little bit more bright a little bit more
vibrant yeah I'm gonna try a vibrant
yellow it's neon oh this is amazing so I
got this top as well from Zara V my
store it's like a t-shirt like a really
low Sling t-shirt it's got leather
patches on the pocket on the pocket on
the shoulders and on the pocket here so
it's kind of got the whole baby colours
but with the touch of like lever for a
bit of paler to it and then I also got
that that slingback top or this thing
about I don't know what to call it like
the top of the low back I got it in a
cream color as well and it's really soft
like she could see the fabric I don't
know it's just this really thin soft
fabric and it looks so breathable and
expensive so from Zara I also ended up
buying two of these bags because I don't
know if you've seen the ones they're
hundred pounds from Zara and they're
like the big leather bags and they're
really quite heavy but they're really
really nice but I didn't want to spend a
hundred pounds in the bag I've got like
enough bags but I really wanted a new
everyday work bag so I picked these up
they're not roll ever but they more or
less are really really sturdy they look
like they're real level they look really
really good they're not bad quality in
there forty pounds and I got it in the
tan because I love tan and they also got
it in the black because this is a bit
more everyday I think but the thing of
the black I think it's a bit it may be a
bit too shiny I don't know what do you
think that's just the most random bits
to UM show you so I want the client that
I'm working for as a retailer at the
moment so that's what our project is
that and they do this thing called a
sale and like I was a sale and say
literally because they're quite a big
retailer they have loads of bits and
those are bobs and my hair's messy sorry
and I basically bought like bedsheets
and stuff and like this throw this
really
syllabus black and silver and fluids
striped throw I've got this for three
pounds and I think it's about 20 pounds
I also got like the this pillow case in
this gorgeous like purple I bought this
for 50 P so I got two of them for a
pound and I'm buying all these
pillowcases because by God's grace we
might we'll have our own house very very
soon so I was like oh let me get
decorating and I love pastels anyway I
know that I love pastels and I know that
I probably have cream sofas so any kind
of colored throw I put over it would
look nice like that pillow would look
nice and cream and I bought it in a teal
this striped one here until and I bought
this textured one as well so I also
ended up buying these pink wedge shoes I
hate showing my shoes on on the camera
because I have huge feet and some people
are like oh my gosh though she's a huge
yes they aren't huge okay fine but
they're from Primark and they were 16
pounds to be honest I thought there were
ten pound and I thought about about
they're sixteen pounds so yeah some like
pink wedges pinky wedges which I think
will go nice with like my leather coat
and all the other stuff that I bought I
then bought this shirt which I don't
like so much now well I do kind of like
it it's alright it's like quite there's
quite garish for me so I'm not sure what
I think but I do need like some pattern
tops Saatchi yeah quite like it might
keep that just somewhat pants like this
just something like pleats and crew one
with there's just sitting you down in
front and they're kind of high-waisted
and they're kind of crop so they're
still trendy but there's still quite a
very very smart as I need to be but I
bought this shirt people lot people
asked me for it
and I bought this shirt with the this
shirt with the collar that looks like
this
but the beads these are all beaded and
if you can see it and I bought this from
H&amp;amp;M for 30 pounds quite expensive so if
you can do the beating yourself I would
go ahead and do that
and then I bought these denim right
skinny legg in geni things jeggings for
15 pounds as well from H&amp;amp;M and finally I
thought I'll show you my American
Apparel leggings that I finally bought
these about two months ago maybe just
because I knew that I wanted them I've
got the leggings and because it was
getting cold I was just like I can't
wear the leggings so I'll just wear
these ones and they really call their 70
pounds but I think they were nervous and
my friends got a pair of these she's had
hers for like three years and she wears
them all the time at least once a week
they make an appearance for three years
so I think it's worth the investment
it's really good material and stuff like
that so guys that is my whole video it's
been ages since I did them I'm hopeful I
don't do too many because I'm trying to
save up so yeah I see you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
