for you guys but as I call it it's a new
in in my last video like last month I
said I'm not going to be doing like
really big hauls anymore and what I'm
going to do is share with you just a few
key pieces that I buy over the month
that are usually for a specific reason
so we are almost coming to the end of
summer I mean it's not the end of summer
but we basically got August left but we
basically got September after that which
is back-to-school time so for me this is
that the last bits of summer that I'm
gonna get to buy the kind of really
summery like beach wear items for and
I've got a holiday planned I'm going to
the Maldives
I've been on trips and they're more work
eat rips but Maldives is not a working
trip a little bit but not really a
working trip so I'm so so excited and I
wanted to share with you the last bits
of summers that I have got and I
basically went on to my favorite sites
which is misguided but I don't have my
misguided bitch yet they haven't come in
yet and azar River Island and I randomly
shot on boohoo and I don't really shop
on boohoo but their ad is very very
addictive and there's one dress on the
ad and I was like you know what I need
to get me this dress and I got it so
what I'm going to do I'm going to show
you the bits that I have and I want you
to help me choose which bits I should
keep because my concept of like know how
I shop now I don't need to buy like 4 to
5 key pieces so I've got like 5 summer
dresses I'm only allowed one or two of
them so what you guys say leave me a
comment and tell me what dress you think
should be my last of summer dress ok so
anyway I'm talking a lot get a cup of
tea get comfortable because this is
gonna be a good one and the other reason
why I was like you know I can't really
stop stop doing horses because I realize
that people love to see like what I like
in the stores and you know I feel like
when I do these videos it gives you guys
ideas of what to buy and how to style
things as I can't just stop doing that
so that ok fine we'll make it more
interactive like this so even though
I've got 5 dresses in them and you're
going to keep one of them and because I
haven't actually tried them on yet
you guys might think I'll do not that
one's more suitable for me or something
so
know that and this is at least
beneficial to y'all so let's get started
so my new favorite trend is anything
that's kind of gypsy I love showing my
shoulders and I love it like when it's
big and tasseled I just feel like
there's something really elegant and
girly and flirty and like sexy seniorita
about it and so I found this white dren
it's fitted it's from boo calm I think
this was like super cheap I think is
like 20 pounds and I won't like - boo
hoo is super affordable so this is one
of my first picks what I really like
about it is that the the frills is a
really big thrill and I find that a
really large frill is really really
flattering I really like the white I
think the white is great for the beaches
as well so let me know if you think I
should go with the white in the comments
afterwards I have this Navy oh my gosh
this Navy looks so rich on camera are so
amazing this navy dress now it's from
their night collection and I was like
you know I'm never gonna wear a dress
like this here so I don't want to spend
like loads and loads of money but on
holiday one night you know night out
with the hubby candlelit dinner
I might just find myself wearing this
little hook section number and I picked
this up in this navy color and it's
basically got slits through the legs and
it's got a bodysuit piece in the middle
which I thought was really really nice
and I really do like the Navy this was
the one that the dress that I saw on the
ad and I was like oh my gosh I want this
they had no more of the black left but
they did have the Navy and they do have
the sand so I've also picked up the
sandy color of the exact same dress as
well so let me know which one do you
think is maybe a bit more suitable for
me if I should go for the sandy one I
should go for the blue one
I mean dark colors is usually my like
security blanket but then I might should
I go for something a little bit lighter
as well let me know what you guys think
so basically on a tour site I only
bought one thing and it was this
gorgeous black jumpsuit again it has the
ruffled like kind of sleeves and
off-the-shoulder stuff what do they even
call that is it cool like the chips hit
can't remember what it's called but I
just thought this was such a beautiful
beautiful piece and because I know that
I really like that style I was like I
wanted to get something in that style so
I picked that out and I love the fact
that it's like a cat suit in style it's
quite tight it's quite sexy but I could
definitely see me this wearing this on a
night out while on holiday but I can
definitely see me wearing it here on an
evening out so I don't feel like it's
are going to be a piece that I'll never
wear again while my body looks like this
I'm aware that as you know do the other
two things I bought on ASIS for these
sandals and I have these black wrap ones
which I think are beautiful I love
anything that's like tie up in design
right now it's like really my thing my
thing but I also bought these sandals
which are kind of like Birkenstocks and
however Birkenstocks are really
expensive for what they are they're like
sixty pounds and I really wanted a pair
but I was like you know what I'm just
going to go find some black strappy
sandals with a really strong base so let
me know what one you think I should keep
if you think I should keep both not be
honest if you kind of want to keep both
because they are quite different but
seeing as I'm trying to be good and not
be such a hoarder of the same things let
me see which pair you guys think I do so
next up the place that I've been
absolutely loving is river island it's
kind of weird I shop there on and off on
and off on and off and I forget to shop
then I'm like oh you haven't bought some
bits from River Island that much and I
think I'll shop there more when I go out
to the shops versus when I just shop
online so I got number one this car key
draped top I'll show you it like that I
stand up and I really really like cocky
as a color on me and I love the suede
like 70s style and fashions gonna be so
so in it's going to keep going and I
love that kind of sweaty texture and
it's great for hiding the lunch baby
okay after that I bought this mustard
bodysuit and for me I love color and I
realized how much they actually do love
color and so I feel good when I wear
color this masterpiece is gorgeous I'm
gonna wear it when I am away with either
like a little like flirty skirt awesome
like denim shorts or something like that
and it is a little bit low but it's not
too bad on the boobies I think is
actually quite a nice piece and that is
that it's a bodysuit like that so it's
got pop
on the bottom so I've been needing a new
bag in my wardrobe I need a bunch of new
bags the one thing I never buy is bags
and accessories so I ended up buying
this bag here it is real leather and I
love the kind of suede II crocodile
design on the front of it and I love an
oversized bag like I have the somber one
that I've had for so long and I use it
all the time but it's just like worn and
just ugly and I was like you know what
let me get myself a new bag I basically
go with black bags or I go with designer
bags so I have a to designer box bags
but nothing I can wear like every single
day so I thought that this was a really
nice everyday bag I love the sluttiness
of it I'm gonna call something like this
and on purchase this is one of those
ones that might have to go back to the
store but the ones that you kind of
really really like and it's basically
this black drapey kind of waist coat
without sleeves I don't know why I
bought it
I saw it on a mannequin I was like I
love that and I'm not necessarily gonna
wear it that much right now but I just
really loved the way that it was cut and
the way it fit so I can just see me
wearing it over so many different little
things and I think if you're someone who
wears like you know vest tops and stuff
it's nice to wear something like this
over it if you're not that comfortable
with your shoulders and this is just
really nice and drapey and kind of loose
I can still wear it on like a summer
evening
so my necklace in fake jewelry
collection is just growing ever so large
it is becoming my massive thing and I'm
loving oversized necklaces I picked this
one up from River Island as well I just
love the silver and the blue I just feel
like it has a really nice beachy vibe
and if it was a really pretty piece they
had one that was super super chunky but
I didn't feel confident like wearing one
that was like hardcore chunky but I kind
of wish I bought it now but maybe I'll
get it later and then I love a necklace
that is like layered and stuff and lots
of the times especially in Topshop and
River Island you can get the sets of
necklaces and I do think they're really
quite nice to just get a bunch of
necklaces as well if you can't be
bothered to keep layering necklaces from
lots of different places just get one
really nice one so guys that is the
end of my whole video or my new in video
as you can see so little bit shorter
than what I used to do I'm sure you
still have a cup of tea with it though
and let me know which look you liked the
most and what things you think I should
definitely keep for my summer trip I
want your feedback guys and let me know
what you want to see next thank you so
much for all your you know comments and
things that you said on my last video I
really really appreciate just
interacting and everything that you say
like it makes so much difference to me
it makes you know just doing video so
worthwhile so guys thanks for watching
and I'll see you or later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
