today's video is going to be my asia
hall i actually didn't get that much
stuff because and it's been that much
time shopping a lot but i'll show you
the few bits and bobs that i did get so
i'll just talk about the accessories
that I've got um so I'm sure you can see
all these kind of Bengali bits and
Bobby's that I've got all over me and
the my necklace I've also gotten this
one as well and these I actually didn't
get in the store I got them from like a
street seller on Watchers on the beach
as a beach there but when i was in bali
and their loads of these people round
with all this stuff i don't know if they
make it themselves but it's just amazing
this really really trademark of like
beach girl and I was like what I'm going
to be a bit of a beach girl even though
i don't really surf and you know the
chain is really really cute i hope you
can see that the detailing on it and
stuff like this strap is made of leather
it's a really cool one this one's like
beads and that's stretchy like that
these are all made of cotton and
intertwined in the cotton I like bits of
wood bits of metal few coins and this
one as well as in to try and write more
metal and more stuff like that I got it
in the black the fluorescent green and
the brown with the beads and I just love
it kind of all together it really
doesn't look that you also got some
other accessories such as this really
cool watch and now it says Omega but
it's clearly not an omega watches like a
fake but I got this on the market or in
Trenton market in Malaysia and there's
so many people selling watches and stuff
like that and I just looked you know
this is a really classic-looking watch
and i love the face even though it's a
fake I just loved the way the face
looked was like all like even among all
the riffraff on my hand how cute does
that look Joe me with all of that drunk
on it it just looks so fabulous and as
I've got to get it actually did already
falling apart but you know I could
easily get that sorted
that's not a biggie i also bought this
chain in singapore i think it's in the
far east plaza I think and it's just
lovely who the brown and then it goes
down to the golden them back up to the
brand and it's kind of a choker ish type
necklace and also the Far East pods are
a book and you know the topshop scallop
tops right then literally it's just the
same as the top drop scallop tops but it
was in a see-through material and I was
like oh enough see-through see-through
so me and I just picked up one of these
as well my friend picked up one is what
is it smells really funny what sorry
it's not that I smell it smells kind of
curry yeah maybe that's from epitome
okay so okay my my splurges in Singapore
this is why I probably didn't buy that
much and stuff and basically there there
are these stores where you could buy
designer clothing but these are like
overstock of designer clothing so they
had DV they had govan she had sure now
addresses and they don't you there was
only like one or two pieces they won't
like loads and loads of those of them
but they won't they're not really
allowed to sell this stuff but I know
that they get it from warehouses with
their over stocks and they just get one
to what they can find and basically they
had herve leger dresses okay oh my god
hello and you know I don't think
everyone there or everyone really knew
what those dresses were so they could
tell they were higher quality dresses
but they didn't really understand the
brand so they were tipped like selling
and herve leger dresses like 800 pounds
but they were sending it for like 200
pounds so I like oh my dear and that
ended up buying make three curvalicious
like outfits so first thing I was I
don't know why this looks pink it is
coral it is a coral dress and it's
gorgeous you're seeing me a mac some
pictures wearing this dress and it's
just a little surprising one as well
this kind of one shouldered one with the
brown the blue are just the peach and
everything
and this is just another classic gee
you've just got to have one of these in
your wardrobe just like Cheryl Cole no
I'm not sure and i also bought a black
bodycon skirt from herve leger as well
but I come from up to bring it out but
you get the idea so I also went to in
Malaysia went to forever 21 oh my gosh
and actually really liked it shocked
because the last time I went though I
didn't like forever 21 but um I bought
this skirt and my sister was like come
on it reminds us of like these
old-school African short skirts that you
had to had to wear to church but i loved
it i but this is just so over-the-top
and so unnecessary but so necessary and
it's like got like shiny bits in it and
it's like a maxi skirt with a split down
the side and i've got this new thing of
just wearing unappropriate pieces about
unappropriate times and it's just so
appropriate so this is definitely one of
those my probably show you how I would
wear this like to the supermarket yeah
it's a Maxis girl likes shiny silvery
bits in it but who cares who cares so I
love that then I've got just like other
obsession now was like ethnic epicness
and prints and stuff like that and then
I got this picked up this shirt from
forever 21 as well and it's in the
recent stock as well so you can probably
pick this up and I just love the kind of
print that Aztec print on it as like yes
this is going to fit my current
obsession so that's cool and you know
what this looks really good with this
together so unnecessary but so necessary
and that's literally I'm gonna wear
clothes from now on this ring which is
like an another kind of ethnic II ethnic
style ring and that is just so cute on
especially if my nails paint
but we don't like it the wedding ring it
doesn't really appropriate the
engagement ring but oh god yeah and then
i also bought this um belt which has got
this cute tassili being here as well and
that is it that is my hall so I really
can get that much but they're nice
pieces and I couldn't have got them in
UK especially all this stuff like this
stuff is that ah and yet that's a hell
fence watching guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
