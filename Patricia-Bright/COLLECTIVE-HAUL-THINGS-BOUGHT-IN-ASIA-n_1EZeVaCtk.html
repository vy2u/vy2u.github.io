today's video is going to be my Asia
haul I actually didn't get that much
stuff because and it's been that much
time shopping a lot but I'll show you
the few bits and bobs that I did get so
I'll just talk about the accessories
that I've got um so I'm sure you can see
all these kind of bangles bits and
bobbies that I've got all over me and
the my necklace I've also gotten this
one as well and these I actually didn't
get in a store I got them from like a
street seller on watchos on the beaches
a beach Center when I was in Bali and
they're loads of these people around
with all this stuff I don't know if they
make it themselves but it's just amazing
this really really trademark of like
beach girl and I was like I'm gonna be a
bit of a beach girl even though I don't
really surf and you know the chain is
really really cute I hope you can see
that the detailing on it and stuff like
this strap is made of leather it's a
really cool one this one's like beads
and that's stretchy like that these are
all made of cotton and intertwined in
the cotton I like bits of wood bits of
metal a few coins this one as well as
into time the right more metal and more
stuff like that I got it in the black
the florescent green and the brown with
the beads and I just love it kind of all
together it really doesn't look that you
also got some other accessories such as
this really cool watch and now it says
Omega but it's clearly not an Omega
watch it's like a faith but I got this
on the market or in Trenton market in
Malaysia and there's so many people
selling watches and stuff like that and
I just looked you know this is a really
classic looking watch and I love the
face even though it's a fake I just
loved the way the face looked I was like
all like even among all the riffraff on
my hand how she does that look jomi with
all of that junk on it it just looks so
fabulous and as I gotta get it actually
did already falling apart but you know I
could easily get that sorted
that's not biggie I will support this
chain in Singapore I think it's in the
Far East Plaza I think and it's just
lovely who the brown and then it goes
down to the gold and then back up to the
brown and it's kind of a choker ish type
necklace and also the Far East paws are
a bought BAM you know the Topshop
scalloped tops right then literally it's
just the same as the Kitab drop
scalloped tops but it was in a
see-through material and as I always
loved see-through see-through sue me and
I just picked up one of these as well my
friend picked up one as well it's it
smells really funny it's what sorry it's
not that I smell it smells kind of curry
okay okay my my splurges in Singapore
this is what I probably didn't buy that
much stuff and basically though they're
leaf stores where you could buy designer
clothing but these are like overstock of
designer clothing so they had ddv they
had Givenchy they had shown our dresses
and they don't mean there was only like
one or two pieces they weren't like
loads and loads and loads of them but
they weren't they're not really allowed
to sell this stuff but I know that they
get it from warehouses with their
overstocks and they just get one to what
they can find
and basically they had her leisure
dresses okay oh my god
hello and you know I don't think
everyone there or ever really knew what
those dresses were so they could tell
they were higher quality dresses but
they didn't really understand the brand
so they were tip like selling in a Herve
Leger dress is like 800 pounds but they
were selling it for like 200 pounds so I
like oh my god and I ended up buying
like three like outfits so first thing I
was I don't know why this looks pink it
is coral it is a coral um dress and it's
gorgeous you're seeing me
some pigeons wearing this dress and it's
just a minister classy one as well this
kind of one-shouldered one with the
brown the blue and just the peach and
everything and this is just another
classic gee you've just got to have one
of these in your wardrobe just like
Cheryl Cole no I'm not sure and I also
bought a black body con skirt from her
villager as well but I come up to bring
it out but you get the idea so I also
went to in Malaysia went to forever 21
oh my gosh
and she really liked it shocked because
the last time I went no I didn't like
forever 21 but I bought this skirt and
my sister was like come on it reminds us
of like these old-school African short
skirts that you had soap had to wear to
church but I loved yeah but this is just
so over-the-top and so unnecessary
what's really necessary and it's like
got like shiny bits in here and it's
like a maxi skirt with a split down the
side and I've got this new thing of just
wearing
unappropriate place is about
unappropriate times and it's just so
appropriate so this is definitely one of
those and I probably show you how I
would wear this like to the supermarket
yeah it's a Maxis girl likes shiny
silvery bits in it but who cares who
cares so I love that then I've got just
like other obsession now there's like
ethnic epicness and prints and stuff
like that and I got this picked up this
shirt from forever 21 as well and it's
it's in the recent stock as well so you
can probably pick this up and I just
love the kind of print that Aztec print
on it as like yes this is going to fit
my current obsession so that's cool and
you know what this looks really good
with this together it's so unnecessary
but so
Cerie let's get you I'm gonna wear
clothes from now on this ring which is I
can remember the kind of ethnic II
ethnic style mean and that is just so
cute on especially if my nails paint it
but we don't like it with the wet I mean
it doesn't look really appropriate the
engagement ring but yeah and then I also
bought this um belt which has got this
cute tastily thing here as well and that
is it that is my haul so I've been
thinking that much but they're nice
pieces and I couldn't have got them in
UK especially all this stuff but this
stuff is that ah and yeah that's a
health fence watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
