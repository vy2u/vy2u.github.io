have a lovely hole for you spring is in
the air the Sun has been shining like
it's been crazy different to normal it's
felt so nice almost like summer and I've
just been like yes time for some color
some parents some text drama here and
I'm just not having a wardrobe we've had
but adding some springy a bit into my
closet and it's so so so much fun I'm
absolutely loving it and there's
something about wearing clothes that a
little bit more bright and fun that make
you feel a bit like more bright and fun
and stuff like that so I've got lots of
bits that I want to share with you guys
most of its online but there's a couple
of other bits um stores I don't normally
go to but this is going to be a long one
as I always say get a cup of tea and get
comfortable you know get your pen and
papers out as well just in case you want
to buy a few bits but I have everything
linked in the description bar below so I
hope you enjoy so the first thing I've
got is this really long kind of older
fro parka jacket from Zara I love the
color of this it's kind of like a muted
I don't know what color would you call
this it's like a burnt orange burnt
orange and obviously the whole seventies
trend and stuff is back in staff I
really do like the color palette of the
70s I think it looks really really nice
so I got myself a burn orange jacket
like this and the thing I've recently
been realizing when it comes to outfits
and styles it's all about the outerwear
if you have a nice piece of outerwear
especially if you live somewhere cold
like in the UK that if you have a nice
jacket you can literally be wearing like
underwear underneath but you'll look
great and put together so I've been
investing a bit more in just nicer
outerwear and then I just bought a
really big nice bucket bag I have the
black version of this which I wear all
all all the time but I felt like I just
needed something that was a little bit
more fun a little bit more springy as
well so from ASOS I went a little bit
crazy I got some really really nice bits
obviously I love azores and they've got
so many great items I wanted to share
with you so number one it's these pants
I love trousers as well a lot I find
them very flattering they make my butt
look great they hide the belly and they
just look really good and I thought that
this was a really nice kind of
- the green color trousers don't let the
camera fool you these look buff and they
fit amazingly I also decided to buy
basics I think these come in a pack of
two and it's like 20 pounds on the pack
of two but it's just a black and white
vest top I love this like this because
they're really easy to wear with maybe
like silly jeans or shorts you can
literally wear them with everything and
I think that you always need some basics
and I love this kind of material because
you can wash it so many times and it
won't go all bubbly and horrible these
just always look really fresh also I
bought a green t-shirt Green is
literally my color right now Patricia is
getting a bit carried away
I bought this green t-shirt and I love
t-shirts with like a really large pocket
on one of the boobs and I don't know I
had a t-shirt like this before that I
love again the materials really nice and
it's one of those materials that when
you wash it it won't go blah Blee
nowadays with my pickup clothes I'm
always looking for items that you know I
can wear over and over and over and
they're not just gonna look really tatty
another thing I like for this season is
the off-the-shoulder I'm sorry that when
it's white it goes really really bright
but I love that off-the-shoulder trend
and this is a gorgeous gorgeous
off-the-shoulder rush one and it's got
buttons just down the middle I think it
just feels like summer when you're
wearing it and it's a bit like kind of
festival II as well so I think it's a
really nice look the next I have this
jacket is actually from River Island but
azor sells river island and I just love
the tassels on it and I can imagine like
twirling in this and just looking
fabulous
so it was a really really nice piece it
was sixty pounds it is a little bit
pricey but it's just one of those kind
of unique things and I have this theory
now about dressing that it's okay to
have one or two out there pieces and you
just pair them with basics which is why
I bought those two basic vests and that
I could wear like literally every day
and then I can add you know a jacket
like this that's a little bit hello out
there and I've got a couple of bits of
shoes I've been loving loving sandals
these sandals are actually gorgeous and
know that I don't have the most
beautiful toes in the world that I
really don't they actually look like
fingers but I don't care I'm good
bring them out some days I must show my
toes these are really really cute
they're 20 pounds I thought that quite
affordable and then I also bought a
chunkier pair as well now these are not
the most sexiest but they're so
comfortable that I actually don't play
I'm going to wear these with skinny
jeans I'm gonna wear these with short
shorts and t-shirts and be like yes look
at my uncle's shoes but feel really good
wearing them finally I bought a pair of
really pretty Hills now they might look
a bit weird right on camera they're
gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous on their
really feminine and for me I've been
trying to get things that a little bit
more stand out that can wear with basics
as you can clearly see and I just
thought this was a really nice shoe so
next I bought lots and lots of items
from Topshop I've just been trying to
find a couple of extras that are really
nice to have in my wardrobe so next I
picked up these super torn jeans from
Topshop how amazing are these
I just thought yes these are really nice
and I love torn jeans sometimes I tried
to do it myself but it's never just as
good as when you buy them torn like
honestly or if they like naturally tear
so I don't know I bought this pair I
love the color I think it's nice great
for springtime as well and they fit if
it okay but I need to wear them with the
belt otherwise my crotch will be just
hanging really really low because
they're quite tight on my thigh but not
tight on my waist so that's a bit weird
they're Topshop but there are actually
from the brand glamorous next I also
picked up some skinny jeans I needed to
replace some with older ones that I have
and they're just a bit worn and a bit
washed out and the crotch is a bit
missing yeah so I bought two new pairs I
really like the fit of the Joanie and I
like the fit of the Jamie so I picked up
two pairs I've got this kind of like
grey colour slightly torn in the in the
Jamie and I've gone for more of a
classic normal Jean color in the Jamie
as well after that I bought this really
cute salmon pink waistcoat I'm loving
loving loving waistcoats at the moment I
just think they're so flattered and they
look so beautiful and this color was so
feminine actually did a blog post
wearing it and waistcoats I just think
they look nice for like the summer time
so I want to actually get a couple more
but I stick to this one right now it's a
really nice piece finally I picked up
this stripy piece as well I never really
buy pattern things as I Patricia
everything you have is that really
playing so I picked up this nice kind of
top it's kind of looks torn and stuff a
bit elf fish but it's actually really
really nice on blue and white I like
some of my favourite colours and you
look really nice on my skin tone so I
thought this is a nice piece to pick up
so moving on to misguided you guys know
that I absolutely love misguided so
number one this dress is a misguided you
can see the hams are hands all over it
it's so so lovely I love this kind of
neckline and it's got a criss cross back
as well it's just in another salmon pink
I think I really like pink as well
basically I'm loving color well again
we're hey hey and I just think it's a
nice designer I can imagine me in like
Santa Monica just wearing this dress
yeah dreaming about the holiday already
then bought myself another off the
shoulder top this is more of a plane off
the shoulder top and but I really like
it it fits so well it's like so fitted
and so sexy in bar and it's got this
little crochet detail at the bottom as
well so you can sort see a little bit of
flesh which is quite nice and finally I
got this really nice bomber jacket I am
I wearing it this way I love love love
bomber jacket I think they're so nice
and I've just no nice outerwear piece as
mentioned I love outerwear pieces I
think they really do add to your
wardrobe and this was quite affordable
and it's just nice it's a little bit
thin it's not like a thick one my jacket
people if you go and buy it don't you
know tell me off it's thin but it looks
great and finally I bought these tassel
shorts as well again these are the
summertime peas that I will wear on a
hotter location I'm not going to be
walking down
tooting High Street rarely okay but
these are very very nice and they have
that fit that I like it kind of comes up
at the side and versus being like a
really straight cut pair of shorts so
next I have some Nikes I think these are
the Ultron warrior I'm like yeah I think
these are the ultra Noir a men's and
these are so amazing the guys at Mikey
did give me a gift
laughter I've worked with them in the
past so I use the voucher to basically
buy these and they're like ID because
they've got PB at the back or give you
guys a closer so they're really really
nice and I just love the fit the ultra
mores are so light so flattering they're
not bulky and especially for a Bigfoot
girl like me so finally I got some
pieces from some other one-off store so
I'm just going to show you them all
together one I got this gorgeous bikini
set from American Apparel American
Apparel is so expensive who shops there
you guys ridiculous like will you go in
you're like getting three pieces you're
spending a hundred and eighty quid what
would I buy got is it gold lace so
expensive however if you're a good
bargain shopping like myself you can go
ahead and find this this was a gorgeous
bikini set so buff so hot but these are
the bottoms as well it's just a gorgeous
gorgeous beginni set this cost me 11
pounds Hey
originally it was literally like 42
browsers like and no if you check
through the sale rail they have some
great items on there that are at normal
prices but 11 pounds is a bargain for
such a nice bikini set I also went to
and other stories and I picked up a
couple of pieces sadly ended up taking a
couple of dresses and stuff back and one
thing I did keep was this really nice
chunky jumper 65 pounds originally let
this jump is actually heavy look it's
physically heavy it could break your
wrist it's so heavy really good quality
I then went to beyond retro because I
wanted to get myself a pair of shorts
and will need a pair of Levi's shorts
you have to go in from time to time and
see which ones they have they are
vintage and it just depends on what
they've got in stock they're 25 pounds
and the Levi's high-waisted shorts that
cut up and look very sexy it's 25 pounds
I do think that is quite expensive but
they're a classic piece like you can't
really go wrong with those I also need
an update to my belt collection so I
ended up buying to belt their belts on
all 10 pounds or 12 pounds very good
leather belts as well some are faux
leather but they're really good I'd
rather go for a vintage belt for 10
pounds then buy a new belt for 45 pounds
think it's ridiculous and I just bought
a brown one and a black one and actually
this brown one's a gap belt so hey then
I also bought this cutoff of the
shoulder and Hawaii kind of t-shirt
thingamabob here which I thought was
really nice and this might be my on my
favorite pieces of all this is this
really gorgeous gorgeous Adi - jacket go
I literally am in love with the fit
because it's kind of like oversized let
the sleeves are a little bit longer us
just it's just the one it's amazing
actually bought this on a very online I
do work with very it once in a while I
think I'm working with them really
really soon and I picked some stuff off
the site I just like this jacket is
amazing and I hadn't seen it anywhere
else so I was like yes yes I love it so
