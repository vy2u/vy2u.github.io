wanted to do something a little bit
different and I wanted to have a little
switch up on the traffic hall and I
wanted to do almost like a shop with me
when I go to the store and kind of bring
you guys along now I know it's kind of
hard with as you might see like to film
in shops in the UK but I might try and
get you know a little bit of footage
here and there but I kind of wanted to
bring you guys on the journey and
funnily enough I've always been someone
who shops online a lot but sometimes
it's really nice to just go in the store
once in a world so that's what I wanted
to do today and kind of show you what
I'm like when I'm in the store I'm not
entirely sure how this is going to pan
out I hope it goes well and for those of
you who are not subscribed to my channel
subscribe um I have all my details down
below but yeah let's go shopping
oh yeah let's go my gosh I just come up
to the shopping center I'm using my big
camera but I'm going to stop it out for
my vlog camera because I don't want any
security guards like chasing me down or
anything like that and the key places I
want to go to today or H&amp;amp;M and River
Island so yeah that's it oh right here
now I've got to work out where the
entrance is because I hate parking in
car parts because I have the worst
driver ever
so I basically go
way to the end to find the biggest car
part
pin space for myself because I'm that
bad
I'm done here hmm actually didn't get
any bits I tried on there's some other
things I got when I went out and the
kind of person that I have to kind of
shot twice the number ones you have
island what I really want is a really
nice jump out awesome knitwear this is
super cute I really like this right I am
done shopping if I got some fairly nice
bit I'm probably going to top it up with
shopping online Congrats
why would manly do but it's best it
works I'm going to do that my second
field right back I'm going to do it a
little bit differently because I'm going
to talk through the outfits rather than
hold them and what I have are these
skinny jeans which are from the river
island denim range and I'm not going to
lie I'm not lacking in jeans but I feel
like you can never have enough of the
perfect pair and what I really like is
the color of these jeans and they're not
ripped and I feel like all my jeans have
got rips on them so I decided to not go
for a ripped Jean and then I picked up
this t-shirt and what I really like this
t-shirt I'm going to come in and show
you is that it's got some really nice
lacy detailing which looks like a bra
but it's not a bra and I thought that's
a really nice look so next up I have
this jumper here and I am definitely an
it girl when it comes to autumn and I
love this color and I feel like it's
just the perfect fit I'm not going to
like it's really room as well this
detailing on the shoulder I really like
because it kind of don't know it just
switches up the knit pattern you know
and then I just found killer size for
skinny jeans like this and it kind of
just comes over the butt can you guys
see that like detail there it's cute
this jumper here I actually love I feel
like it's the perfect shape for those
days and you have a bunch of baby and
it's just a super comfortable jumper
it's kind of
kind of oversize and Heinz and then look
at the arm details I really like this
and then what I love is this fat the
detail on this is really gorgeous all
right guys I'm coming just in my bra and
I never recommend doing this but it's
buying pieces just to wear together
because hopefully you can wear them as
individuals but I'm not going to lie I
bought these to wear together
it's this white shirt and this brown lip
top which I feel like make the perfect
combination but I feel like the
oversized white shirt as women loads of
different bits and then the brown layer
I might be able to wear once in a while
if you guys are not loving the like
oversized shirt thing then me you are
not kindred spirits I'm living for a
really long shirt like this like I think
it looks really nice and then what I
really like about this river island one
is that it has these gold buttons down
the middle which is a little bit
different I feel like the cotton on this
is a little bit thicker than some of the
other ones I just think it's a really
nice piece and most people like layer it
with jumpers or you know a little bra
layer and I really write that look so
here is it with the river island pilot
which for those of you who are out there
you know with your girls out and your
belly out then I feel like it's a really
nice product but I feel like I'm not
going to be doing that anytime soon
actually I'm going to go to holiday
shortly so you might just see me with
the brawler and some high-waisted
panties panties another some
high-waisted trousers yeah you guys
might be looking at and thinking that
Patricia what are you thinking I just
feel like in a truly cold look it looks
really elegant and this can also be
folded up as well what do you guys think
again
this is just me being a bit extra but I
thought he looks good it's jacket here
live like I saw this jacket and I loved
it I bought it in a size 12 because I
wanted it to be oversize and it's just a
denim jacket and I really liked wash as
well and it says on the back this isn't
my first rodeo I just feel like it's a
really nice
I can like the fit of it he kind of went
off the shoulders Alec m'kay but I just
felt like it was a really nice color I
love the oversized thing and I'm always
buying stuff in my two sides is bigger
than me because it just looks really
nice but those of you who know me you
know I have a coat obsession like it is
a real thing I accept it my coat is my
outfit I can wear nothing I just give me
a coat and we're good to go
but in my wardrobe is just all coats I'm
like a level so this is a really nice
one they see if I could suede coat in
this kind of burnt bread which it feels
really nice for autumn and it's a bit
pricey it's like 80 pounds but I suppose
nice loving it that's it when it's on
properly and actually I bought this in a
size 12 as well because it was really
small so what I want to show you now is
this a longline Park are in khaki then
we just give you a minute and let me let
me just give you a minute because this
is all me like this is a hundred percent
me hundred times like a hundred I love
this park art and it's actually really
warm I think it was 39 pounds and I
don't normally shop on patronymic store
it's been a very long time since I've
done that but I really like this one and
I'm going to find all links that I can
like down below so don't my old I think
as much as I can but um I just felt like
it was really nice and I was doing out
of bombers but actually it's must have a
long lining on like this and then the
color is just right call me love it
right so next up is this jumper here
which is an absolute favorite of mine
and I'm not someone who wears a lot of
Cutler but if I do wear color I actually
feel like red really suits me like I
actually genuinely like read on and I
wore this jumper and people loved it on
my Instagram and my snapchat it look
really nice on the neckline is really
flattering as well and I'm not going to
like kind of shows and like a little bit
of you know Tom and stuff like that but
we can work on there you can just
squeeze in a little bit but I just
really like the color and the fit is
just perfect mostly from H&amp;amp;M I have this
shot here
I feel like it's my 7/8 or structure in
your collection and I really let the
kind of longer sleeves and the stripes
is art I just felt like it was really
nice and I'm like a loose baggy shirt
like this to wear under jumpers and
stuff but I feel like this one I'd wear
on its own it's just a casual piece and
for my working guys out there I feel
like this is a really nice like cool
shut to wear to work or something so
it's a little bit naughty and I bought
three items from misguided but I thought
are these are really nice items and I
really wanted to show them to you one is
this little cropped jumper here and what
I really like is again the larger
sleeves and then the black detailing I
feel that they look really really nice
and all those in a crop top is kind of
loose so it looks really nice with
really high-waisted jeans we are wearing
here and I find it to be kind of
flattering it's not too tight on the
body and I don't know there's something
about these 70 sleeves that I'm
literally living for right now and again
knitwear is ideal for the autumn time
this is another piece from misguided and
it's good for the bright yellow jumper
which it kind of is but I really like
the style of the crop on this it's not
too cropped knit kind of ham and then
the really long sleeves is like my thing
for autumn winter and then the thing I
like the most is the detailing on the
back PC that I don't know what it is I'm
like obsessive like back details it's
like the same way I'm obsessed with like
a bit of clavicle that details is really
sexy as well yeah I'm a big fan I love
it I don't know I feel like it's nice to
have one or two bright pieces of
knitwear and then leave it at that and
final piece is this little suede vodka
jacket and I clearly have a problem
because I'm obsessed with these I buy
them all the time and I think that
jackets are my ultimate vice but I
thought this is really nice
and I know I've got pinkish one and I
know got a blue one and I know got lots
of other biker jackets but I don't have
one in this kind of suede color and I
just am
really really nice piece and of the
silver hardware and it's just one of
those things you kind of throw on when
you're drivin and it looks really cute
and I felt like I will show this to you
guys I might end up taking this one back
if I'm going to be good
hey guys that is the end of my basically
come shop with me travel which I wanted
to do something a little bit different
so let me know what you think if you
guys enjoy a hauls a bit more like this
versus sitting down and showing the
product and then kind of showing you my
process when I'm in store so that's it
keep watching and I will have a video
for you up very soon so guys thank you
