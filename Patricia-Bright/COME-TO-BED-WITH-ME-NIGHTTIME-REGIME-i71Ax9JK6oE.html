I've got a get on ready with me video
which I've called come to bed with me
and I absolutely love watching these
because I'm a bit weird and today I'm
going to show you how I walk through an
evening and when I get ready for bed
so here I am looking raggedy as you can
tell I look very very tired
my eyes hurt and I just need to go to
bed firstly I will get changed though as
the weather has been so hot recently I
found this to be my most comfortable
outfit for bed so to start off I take my
makeup off for the day and I'm using the
LaRouche my cell makeup removal gel I do
find this product to be great at
removing just the first base layer of
makeup but I do still wash my face after
I've used it but it is really gentle on
the eyes and very moisturized so next I
find myself in the bathroom I brush my
teeth I wash my face and I have a shower
clearly I don't need to show you how I
do that so I've got the shower I focus
on three steps firstly it's my skin and
I work on basically reducing my pores
and just ensuring that my face is not
greasy and I'm using the skins product
and it's great because it contains
vitamin A which is great for skin when
you
next I add an eye cream as I used to
suffer from quite dry eyes and I love
dr. lips nipple balm which is great for
dry cracked lips I use this every night
so next is my baby and it's got to be
the cocoa butter the reason I actually
love this is because it smells delicious
and I smell like chocolate when I come
to bed I love this product this might be
really weird but I'm all about the
smells when I'm in bed and I just spray
a little body spray or something on so
that I smell good and finally you'll
find that I have to wrap my hair as I
hate having hair or weave in my face I
always tie my hair at night if I'm being
good some nights I will let it go free
but then it's just not the best night
ever
it's such a simple twist and wrap motion
although halfway through the night it
might be on the pillow so guys that's me
ready for bed
I am one of those people who keep
multiple pillows on my bed I usually
just throw those to the side and I try
to read something encouraging it before
I go to bed and that's it really so guys
thanks for watching and I'll see you in
my next video bye guy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
