video it's finally going to be another
video from the series that I started
when I did the getting my mojo back
video and basically I wanted to call it
guide to life but you guys are like it's
gym tan laundry from what's that show I
can't remember what the show's called
like that reality TV show which is on on
the States I was like ok I don't want to
be gym tan laundry and loads of you guys
suggested the brighter life and I
thought that sounds so beautiful so I
would definitely be going with that name
to do it I think this is going to be
like the first official video but it's
not really official but yet the first
video in this series and I wanted to
call it and it's all about confidence
and self-esteem because this is one of
the things that I get asked about the
absolute most on this channel and
especially when I do talking videos and
I tweet it out I think it was on Tuesday
I sent a tweet out on Monday I sent a
tweet out to you guys like what other
topics that you guys want me to discuss
on the topic of confidence and those of
you just came back I was absolutely
overwhelmed with the response from you
guys and like as a bit nervous because
I'm just a normal person and I'm so
happy that I have you guys and I had the
opportunity to share and I'm not a
professional or anything but I feel
sometimes you guys just like to hear
from normal people like myself and other
girls on YouTube just for our take on
things because we've probably been
through the exact same things that
you've been through so I'm so glad that
you guys respond in such a way and I
just hope that I can glaze just the
icing on the cake of some of these
topics so when it comes to confidence
and those of you guys talked about body
image being in situations and
self-esteem these were like different
situations and self-esteem so let's get
philosophical you know I've been
thinking about this a long time and I
was like what is confidence confidence
is not necessarily you know that person
who's the now
this the life and soul of the party
jumping on the table swinging their
underwear in the air that's not
necessarily confidence and actually
sometimes that is a sign of hidden
insecurity and and I feel like
confidence is the word that came to my
mind was truth and then I kind of had a
sentence you guys have to check my blog
out actually because I've been mulling
onwards and how I put star together but
the sentence was truth acceptance and
action and I don't know this means this
somewhere else but truth comes to the
acceptance of who you are how you've
been created and very big on being proud
of you as you are and that your
existence means that you're extremely
valuable because the effort it takes to
create a being is not it's not an easy
process so you're here you're valuable
now so if you are a quiet person like I
always give my example of my my sister
and my best friend
these girls are you know they're not
that I'm really loud and I'm a loud
person I talk a lot my sisters know very
quiet though you know gratified as we
call her a my best friend one of my best
friends natalie is very quiet as well
but these girls the internal confidence
that they have they might not say a lot
but when they speak they speak with
authority and integrity and they're very
happy with who they are as individuals
they never try to be loud they never try
to be different and that's the beauty of
quiet confident and again as I say it's
about truth so if you are that person
who's not the loudest person you are
someone who is very very thoughtful you
don't like going out and partying all
night you're not into drinking or you
like watching sci-fi films at home by
yourself in the evening that is fine
if that is the truth of who you are it's
about identifying that that is who you
are knowing who you are as a person
because everybody has a different nature
I'm not the coolest person
and I never have been so and I used to
try and be cool
but it doesn't work because I'm not cool
to the sense of being a uncool and Kumud
look like with the bird I used to try
but then I realized that's not even Who
I am so when you let that go like
accepting who you are your confidence
can soar like this is who I am I'm
Patricia I'm a little bit nerdy I'm
quite loud you're gonna have to accept
that but I'm very happy so this is my
truth and then acceptance means you
accept that that's who you are and
action means you walk in who you are you
put in any kind of end down any kind of
persona that you may have tried to build
or how you may have tried to cover your
nature you put that down and you walk in
in who you are so let's talk about body
image body image it really upsets me
this really upsets me when people are
upset about the way they look and I had
a girl you know she sent me a message
that she has tribal marks so she's got
scars on her faces personally I think
they're beautiful because they represent
something for those of you who have
scars and who have had accidents who've
lost limb whatever I feel like these are
beautiful because they're your story and
when you realize the thing that you have
that someone tries to use against you or
say oh look at your no no look at mine
it's amazing do you know what this means
and that will build your confidence
knowing what your scar means so those of
you who've got burns the fact that you
are alive after the burns is a testimony
of your worth of your destiny of your
future your scars tell a story and those
stories encourage and inspire people for
those of you who are a bigger size as
long as you're healthy
big gods are beautiful okay skinny girls
are beautiful stop trying to model
yourself on that standard of beauty
real like they try to make it and eyes I
say the media but they tried to push a
certain look the reality is when you
walk down the street nobody looks like
that certain look and I know we all
think especially for going those who are
concerned about guys I see guys dating
girls who are completely different all
the time this model in out there it's
not real
okay it's not real you are normal and
you are beautiful and you guys have
heard me say my previous videos girls
who are big rock that fact I seen big I
know I know big girls who take it guy
like guys love them and it's not because
you know they've got lots lots of booty
latina you know it go back that is bond
by the way not just cuz they've got all
of that but they've got a confidence
when they walk in it and you'll find
that about a lot of African women they
like slightly delusional about how good
they look but that is like a great way
to you know embracing what you have and
that confidence more men are attracted
to confidence then somebody's like I
don't like my my Winkle my or I didn't
like wait no no love everything about
those so the next thing was situations
okay lots of different situations
so from speaking in public - um you know
going to parties
- meeting new people - talking to guys
let's talk about talking to guys I was
not personally I was not big on talking
to guys and because I was awkward man
I'm really awkward so I was very much if
a guy spoke to me Abby Lee hello yeah I
don't really to say I never knew what to
say especially if I like the guy and
that is fine like you know not everyone
knows what to say he probably doesn't
know what he doesn't have to be lots of
pressure when it comes to guys and if
you want to learn to speak to a guy that
you like then sometimes you've just got
to do it like you'll feel that kind of
heart beating like
heart-racing that pain in your chest
sometimes you've just got to say I make
Naurang you heart and walk and go high
and then they'll give you the response
of hey and it's always that you can
breathe breathe a sigh of relief like
feel some of you guys mentioned like
public speaking as well that's a hard
one
and I always say in all of those kind of
situations is to act so sometimes I feel
like when I'm at at work I act I act
like I'm confident I act like I know
what I'm talking about sometimes I don't
like even right now I'm like making it
up as I go but it really does help and
the more you get better that do you know
what it doesn't really matter or I can
you know at at top of it or step out of
myself and do this you'll get better at
it and you'll be more confident in
speech so the final one is one again
that really upset me was a lot of people
had issues with their self-esteem and a
lot of people's self-esteem had been
broken because of things that have been
said to them words that have been used
against them people saying you're not
worth anything you're rubbish parents
putting their children down and
boyfriends putting you down friends
putting you down and making you feel
worthless and this is where my passion
really really lies and and I always say
this I say life and death is in the
power of the tongue so speak life if
people aren't saying nice words to you
you better learn to speak nice words to
yourself you need to learn to torture
yourself stand in that mirror and say
this is me I'm beautiful and wonderfully
made I'm funny I'm smart or I'm ditzy
but I don't mind and learn to talk to
yourself so that when anyone has
something bad to say about you you don't
accept it you don't have to accept the
words of someone you can make the choice
to say um no that's not true about me
this is what's true about me actually
and if you don't have anything nice to
say to me then that's fine but stop
talking
and I'll talk to myself and sometimes
it's that confidence one speaking to
yourself will build you up but it also
gives you that confidence to not allow
people to speak down to you and when you
tell people you learn to tell people and
it doesn't have to be rude and it's
almost got to be excuse me and I don't
accept that would you mind not saying
that because that's not true you know
and then you mumble to yourself well I
actually know that I am amazing people
may put you down because of their own
insecurities and actually that's when
you've got to exercise an element of
love well try and analyze their where
they're coming from when they're saying
bad things to you are they actually
confident do they have problems may
there be an element of Genesis ensure
that you fill your life your body your
mind your heart your spirit with
positive words that you can say to
yourself and I personally say like
you're beautiful I believe that
everybody is beautiful because everybody
is so uniquely made what you have to
offer nobody else has to offer the more
you talk about yourself and love
yourself the more confident you'll be so
guys I really hope you enjoyed that and
I know it's a bit different for me but I
love like talking you guys are rad or
giving people day you talk too much but
that's the way but like make sure you
follow me on Facebook and Twitter

a bit silly but any suggestions of what
