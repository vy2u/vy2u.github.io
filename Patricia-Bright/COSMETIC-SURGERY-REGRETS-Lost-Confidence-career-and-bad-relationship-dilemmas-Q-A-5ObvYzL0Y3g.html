the cosmetic surgery the way he loves me
oh gosh we're getting Safi here that
it's so cringe
hello beautiful people welcome back to
my channel I hope you are doing well
today
we are gonna just get into it we're just
gonna get into it on my Instagram and on
my snapchat I think it is one of my
Twitter I asked you guys to send me a
couple of questions we're gonna find out
a little bit more about me I'm gonna
share some truths and stuff and then I'm
also going to answer some of your
dilemmas darlings
your dilemmas I have got you I have I
mean I'm gonna try and have you based on
my slightly limited wisdom but you know
some of you wanted my opinion on
something real life issues and so I'm
gonna try and give that to you today if
you're not subscribed subscribe and you
can follow me on all my social and let's
get into this video this is this is
detail what age did you start your
period and what qualifications do you
have okay
what age was I when I started my period
I feel like that started late in
comparison to people now but I think I
started about 13 maybe 14 so maybe
that's average at the time but I feel
like it's getting younger and younger
for so many girls what qualifications do
I have well I have gtcys I have a levels
and I do have a degree if you don't know
I have a degree in accounting and
Finance yes Patricia do you plan on
having any other kids people love
worrying about my womb that is one of
the most popular questions and the
answers that question is a yes oh yeah I
wanna pop lots of babies out I actually
want to have free babies now but like
finally decided but I don't want to have
that any time soon and so I feel like
you know the pressure is off and I can
you know happen kids in a bit later if I
choose to have some more but yes I would
love to have like two more what are your
tips are being confident you seem like
such a very outgoing front and bubbly
person and I want to be more like that
you know it's easy from me sitting here
on the in
net to come across as bubbly and really
confident but I'm not gonna lie I'm
relatively confident and then I have
internal confidence but you know being
the bubbliest person in the room
actually probably isn't me only when I
get out of my shell only when I get out
my shell when I don't know people I like
this trust me I haven't like when I
first started working about ie if you
don't know I was a career girl I was a
mute I didn't say anything and I think
one of the reasons why I you know I got
made redundant I got you know I lost my
first job yeah I was fired it was
because I literally didn't talk I didn't
gel with the team I was very very
uncomfortable
I definitely look like I had no
confidence and I was mute so for me
learning to speak heart in environment
and that forcing questions in so I had
to ask people is something I have learnt
to do and has also taken practice I'm
ugly right now because I'm here but you
know I'm not like this or the diamond
but my advice is don't stress over it
don't panic and then practice making
yourself uncomfortable which might be
asking someone a question before they
ask you one but what you can do is
prepare yourself by having a list of
questions that you are strangers what do
you do when you're wearing an outfit of
clothing that you really like but they
tell you it doesn't suit you
and it doesn't look good on you I tell
them did you pay for this outfit I look
good I feel good so mind your business
and close your eyes it's not your
business what is it about fashion that
interests you so much I just like to
look good I like to make myself look
good
it sounds really shallow but put it on
your face putting a nice outfit can
always transform your look and I feel
like secretly because growing up we
didn't have loads of money or anything
like that and my you know my mum was not
going to let me I was not wearing trend
listen I will used to wear a church gown
my church gown had puffy sleeves and it
was itchy and I hated it my mom always
made me look like a princess and I did
tested that and so I forgot that one
side might a little bit of freedom all I
wanted to do was buy cool clothing even
though I couldn't afford it so I used to
shop at the markets and that kind of
stuff and just by the trends and I feel
like that's one of the things that I was
really really passionate about
based on just you know my childhood the
trauma of the princess dress what kind
of music do you listen to your favorite
artist song or album what kind of do you
know what you're never gonna believe
this I really I if y'all don't know I'm
a Christian I am and I pass in love with
gospel music another song I love Adele I
genuinely like calm chill out you know
guitar strumming you know happy happy
music the reason being is that I can be
quite hot as you can tell so if I was
listening to like doosh doosh
every day I would literally be like
bouncing off the walls I mean with it
that's virtually the opposite of me that
you know that I enjoy um in terms of
favorite artists I love Lauren Hill
she's on my favorite artist
I love B York a movie as well so like
you know that oldest still sisters that
from the 90s you know today's guys
what's your most use 3 skin products
well I do my night routine all the time
so I'm gonna say my DCL skin I keep
talking about this product it's so good
my DCO skin hydra is it hydraboost i
think it's called the Hydra beasts and
use that every single night I use my
glycolic cleanser from beer skin clinic
I use that almost every single day and I
always use my Mourad um sunscreen those
are three products I always use okay
this is a good question I don't want
that laughs I'm 20 and I haven't been in
a relationship I'm not laughing because
you haven't been in a relationship I
know many people haven't been in
relationships but my ambition is to be a
mother what should I do
I feel like this is a trolling question
but I love you and I know that some
people their ambition is to be a mother
I mean there's ways that you can just
get pregnant I mean this isn't that kind
of video but are you talking about being
in a relationship with someone and then
building a family I think what you've
got to do is bring something to the
table if you want to settle down with a
guy and build a family often you also
have to bring something to your table if
you're gonna spend your whole life
looking
for someone to make you be a mother or
be in relationship with your gonna be of
no value because you're not bringing
anything back so the focus is on focus
on yourself grow your self develop
yourself find your own interest and
practice being a mother maybe you can go
work in a daycare center work with
children see what you really think about
it and then hopefully because you're
focused on yourself and the bright
person will come in who will help you
fulfill your dreams of being a mother my
question is what advice would you give
to someone who's about to graduate
university but is also thinking about
starting at business I love getting all
my business questions I feel like I've
got followers who've got their heads
screwed on and if you ate this and learn
from them because they're really smart
okay I love that what is my advice well
congratulations just hurry up and
graduate there is no rush my little bit
of advice is to read lots of books on
business and learn from other people who
want businesses how do they do it that
way you can learn from their mistakes
I feel like books are basically Mentors
there's even a book I've got by Tim
Ferriss called the tribe of mentors and
it's just some of the you know stuff
that other business people have done and
their stories and stuff I'm reading a
book overnight success by the founder of
rodeo and she's just sharing her story
and how she built her own brand I'd love
to do that one day but the best thing I
can do is learn from other people and
find out how they made it you address
relationships Patricia specifically how
to keep the romance going and we want to
talk about romance now romance I mean I
ain't got the answers I don't have
answers no I'm shaking how to keep the
romance going is to make time for each
other and also to communicate I feel
like as girls well you know I'm a
slightly I'm a grown woman now but a lot
of the time and I'd like this I expect
that my partner can read my mind
so when he's not being romantic I'm
upset why are you not romantic but
actually if I tell him what my
definition of
romance isn't listen on Friday night we
need to do something special that's the
key that's a clear and obvious memo and
then it's in his court to do something
but it's also really good you know as
user guff there's something that you
want say it do it you know that's how
you keep the romance alive you need to
tell people what you want in all areas
I've got a massive dilemma a guy owes me
like four thousand pounds and doesn't
want to pay it back and because he lives
at the YMCA I'm not sure if they will
let the bailiff in why did you lend
someone four thousand pounds question
number one I'm sorry but my opinion is
this if you loan someone money
especially if they'll friend like you
should know money that you can afford to
learn don't know what you can't afford
assume that it's never coming back to
you I know it sounds really harsh one of
my biggest rules is that everyone will
fail you everyone can fail you so don't
be surprised if they do so listen you
might have to check out with the police
or with the court to see if you can get
a bailiff order in you need to google
that but just can't you're 4,000 pounds
I was lost and don't do it again can't
decide what to do as a career I'm
interested in hair and fashion but I
also want a job where I help people
I literally have the thought of being a
doctor a hairdresser an artist and actor
a youtuber a cafe owner all at the same
time girl that is so interesting I love
the fact that you've got big dreams and
big visions good on you and you know why
can't you okay you can't do all of that
but I would say try a little bit of
everything if you're young you have the
opportunity to try stuff and make
mistakes and you'll find out if you
start doing stuff and you actually like
you or not try it and see where it takes
you don't be scared
hi Patricia and the view of thank you
very much I feel like I've dealt with so
much crap in the past few years
especially because I wasted my so many
gap years after high school so I've been
depressed I've lost many friends due to
never wanting to leave my house and I
just generally feel negative all the
time I gained 20 pounds as a result how
can I regain positivity oh my dear I
just
a little hog babes just like darlin come
here darlin don't worry you're worried
about the time of you wasted it's gone
if the time is gone let it let it go let
it go it's gone don't think about that
what you now need to think of is what do
you want to do going forward depression
is one of those things that isn't just
that easy to get over I had to deal with
certain things myself I know it sounds
really hard to believe right but for me
talking to someone really really helped
I haven't seen a counselor but I have
seen an online counselor there's a
platform that I've signed up and used in
the past called better hell and I found
it to be really useful just to have an
online counselor who we could go back
and forth and talk about some of the
things that I was dealing with and I
feel like sometimes all you need is to
solution eyes
how can you regain your positivity I
think positivity is about hope and they
say that when hope is deferred the heart
grows weary so for those of us in
individuals who have got no hope they
can't see the future that is what often
causes depression so a little thing you
can do is set yourself a small goal to
kind of achieve or to look forward to
and that might be you know what today
I'm gonna get up I'm gonna dress up and
put on a little lipstick that's a tiny
goal and the more you're able to achieve
tiny goals the more confident you feel
and your brain feels about your ability
to achieve it oh my gosh this is a bit
of watching this one hi Patricia
I'd like to be anonymous please I'm a 20
year old girl that discovered this thing
called I'm not gonna say what it is
going on were you guys searching it
it's basically humiliating men and
controlling their money and some men
have that fetish with that I paid off a
lot of my loans and everything you can
say it's sex work even though I never
showed my naked body to anyone anyway my
boyfriend found out a couple of months
ago and flipped his obviously I stopped
doing this but now I have a lot of itch
to pay for and I just might lost my job
and it's not easy should I go back to
doing what I was doing should I break up
with my boyfriend just to secure
self and living sign me up
Samuel girl no J I'm actually joking I'm
joking
Christy I am joking oh my god listen
it's like you're not gang up to 20 years
old I got absolute you insult men and
get money what listen 2018 is really
real okay your dad memorize did you
break up with your your boyfriend so you
can get back to doing what you want to
do I think what you should try to do is
talk to him about it again explain to
him you know it's not sex work I can
totally see as to why though you know
your boyfriend might be upset you're
clearly doing something that entertains
or Tiffany to do late well it's the one
that titillates
men and so he might be upset by that
which I totally 100% get you have to
have a frank conversation with him and
ask him where he stands and then you've
got to decide what you want your man or
your money it's up to you
what's your boob job story why did you
get here and was it expensive and do you
have any regrets my boob jobs yes I get
these questions about my boobies oh they
don't really on show today but I get
question about my boobs all the time yes
they are fake they are big old fake
boobies they're not actually big I don't
know why they look big on me it's
because I have skinny arms and quite a
small top frame they're not actually big
boobs but they just look kind of big why
did I get them done because I had really
small boobs that I was really really
uncomfortable with I got to a stage that
was that all right and I was that you
know what I just felt like I look a lot
better and I would feel more
proportionate and more comfortable in my
body if I had a boob job did it about
four years ago I do have regrets I'll be
honest with you I do have regrets about
the cosmetic surgery and one of my
regrets is not doing earlier I wish I'd
done it before I had them done when I
was 25 also I think now I went in
knowing to thinking I knew what I wanted
but I didn't really so I would have
probably gone even smaller because on my
frame and because I didn't have much
breast tissue they kind of looked a
little bit fake baby I'm not gonna lie
because I don't have
fad above so if I'd done a bit more
research I would have gone a bit smaller
and then I would have had like fat put
on top so it looks less boot Robbie you
know I want to look a bit more natural
but we are it is what it is I'm excited
about your cause hey can you share more
info when will it start and how do I
make sure I get in will it be available
to your youth s fam ok if you guys don't
know I will be doing a course it's gonna
it's gonna be called the break because I
won't be the person who gives someone
who buys this course or is enrolled or
watches some of the content and it just
gives them that break that they need to
really step into their next stage in you
know making a business in the digital
space and it is can sound really boring
for some so you can just skip on but for
those of you are really interested I did
this because I found that there were
people who told me stuff that changed my
course in this space and the people who
do not know that they did it so this
course is about really giving providing
people with that you Rica moment that
that a piece of information that
knowledge that helps them getting on
there their next stage in building a
business especially in the social media
and influence a world this is very
specific now it is going to be available
fingers crossed on the 28th of April
we're still in build mode it will be a
paid for course but we are gonna have
some free content and modules as well
just so you can get a tester and then if
you want to buy the entire course you
can as well it's really exciting it's
really powerful and sometimes I don't
want to get too obviously I'm like
really fun and silly as well but I write
I'm a guide that I love business I love
work I love the opportunity of just
creating something and also giving
people that piece of insight to make
their own lives better I'm not a selfish
person I'll tell you all the dirty
secrets I will tell you all of the
secrets that is Who I am as a person and
so this is what this course is I'm just
sharing I'm just I'm just putting it all
out there because nobody wants anybody
to know anything but I've got you
Patricia Brite has got you
have you ever had any pets and if you
could have any pets what would you have
I've never had any pets
no no no no no no no no no no pets I
don't know why my mom was not an animal
person so yeah she wasn't gonna look
after them for me I was going to get a
whippet I really wanted a whip-it dog
because I kind of liked cats huh what is
the best advice I have ever been given
great question I feel like I say this
all the time but it's fail fast fail
fast was given to me by someone who I
don't know if you learned that much but
when he said it it really really stuck
with me and it's this concept of you
know what try everything and if you are
gonna fail just fell quickly and move on
to the next like just take your l1 move
on what do you like the most about your
husband that's a great question I
haven't asked myself that question for a
long time I'm actually I feel like it's
changed the things that used to really
really like about him I just love his
attitude
I love his strength I love his never
give up attitude
I love his he the way he loves me oh
gosh okay

so amazing just to see him be such a
good dad it's a really world what is
your favorite designer brand and why so
my favorite designer brand I can
actually say quite confidently now

connection and I realized that I have a
lot of Balenciaga very rags am i never
realized or thought to myself that
Balenciaga is my favorite designer brand

Balenciaga collection it's super cool
it's kind of street but kind of feminine
at the same time and I really like it
