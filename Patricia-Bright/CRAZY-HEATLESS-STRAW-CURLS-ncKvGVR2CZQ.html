kind of tired of our look and I was
getting really tired of mine so I
thought I would just do some crazy curls
I bought some straws from the shop I was
like you know I'm gonna try and curl my
hair in these and I was fairly
successful so I thought I'll show you
how I did that
so here's my before you guys are used to
seeing me like this long straight hair
really easy
so I just got some simple flexible
straws from the drugstore I have some
bobby pins and I also have just a spray
bottle of water so the process is quite
easy all you want to do is dampen your
hair the tricky bit is actually getting
your hair to stay on this draw and it
took me a while I will say with the
straws once in there fairly easy to
secure by folding but I'm going to show
you close-up how I do that so the trick
is to secure the end piece of your hair
is to get another piece of hair to go
over it and kind of hold it in place as
you can kind of see me doing here
so just squish that roll it around and
just flip the top and the bottom and you
can kind of loop it together the thing
the whole head took me probably about 20
to 30 minutes I would usually do this in
the evening or maybe if you've got it I
can pull off the Noonie you've got some
time to waste so that's me done I left
these in for about an hour overnight
would be ideal I will say so on taking
these down I was really quite surprised
at the way the colors turned out but the
great thing is that they're each unique
but you don't get really defined clothes
you get random pieces all depending on
you know how much hair you actually put
in in the first place so this side
wasn't totally drying so the curls on
this side ended up being a lot looser so
I must say absolutely love the finished
look I've got here it's very random it's
very messy but I just think it's fun
it's nice to have something a little bit
different I love the fact that I can
kind of pin the hair to the side to look
a little bit more professional a bit
more contained but if I want to I can
let it be wild and free so the true
question is the girls of curls have more
fun let me know in the comments and they
thank you for watching and if you guys
are not following me on Instagram make
sure that you do you can watch me
attempt to wink and the worst wing kit
in the world like I always look so
awkward but if you can teach me how to
do it well like tag me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
