to my channel so today I have a
favourites for you I'm very excited
because I don't do favourites all the
time I feel like I say that every single
time that I do a favorites but I don't
do them all the time and it's a great
way for me to share with you what I'm
currently really really loving and also
a great chance for me to have a chit
chat and so many of you guys have been
writing in my comment so I am close to a
million subscribers can y'all believe it
can y'all really believe it I have been
on YouTube for almost six years and I
mean it's kind of crazy to think about
it but we're gonna get there very soon
and I'm so excited about it it's kind of
crazy to Belize I really want to thank
you all and yeah just to know that I am
acknowledging this I am really excited
about it and like it's crazy anywho I'm
gonna go ahead and show you some of the
favorite things that I've got there's
actually quite a lot so as I used to say
get comfortable and get a cup of tea so
I really don't want to rush this one
because I feel like there's lots of
things I want to talk about and I got a
couple of things to say around the items
so it might be long because you know I
like to add lots of extra wording so
yeah let's get started so I'm going to
start off with items that are MIT more
fashion relative number one it is my
waist trainers and I think in my last
video I talked about waist trainers or
it was basically a postpartum band since
having baby grace so I've moved out of
that postpartum band as my belly
obviously went down after like a month
or so and then I moved on to kind of a
waist trainer and I know I was someone
who didn't talk positively about waist
trainers in the past but right about now
I have found it to be very necessary
especially if I have biases this and I
know so many say Patricia you look so
good so slim like the rest of my body is
really slim and then I have this like
mum pouch which is basically because of
my muscles have stretch and they're like
this so when I caught wear a corset it
kind of brings them all in and it
provides that support these are the
that I have and they I paid fifty pound
I literally just googled waist trainer
so it's not a particular one I try and
find the link and what it has is one
that you can wear everyday under
clothing and one that's a little bit
more sturdy and it's great for when
you're working out and I think fifty
quid is a bit much for these but I was
quite desperate and I found that like
when I wear these under my clothing it
really does make a big difference
because I really have this kind of poop
that kind of comes out and I'm really
working out to try and get it back to
normal and I don't want people to think
that oh wow like snapback game is strong
when we out here doing what we can do to
make it work so the next thing I want to
share with you is Dee pop and I am
working in partnership with Dee pop just
to let you guys know but I have
mentioned D pop about a thousand times
and I've talked about how to make money
online when I talk about selling the
stuff having clear out I always say
indie pop and if you guys don't know
about Dee pop it's basically an app
where you can buy and sell clothes on
line you can sell your clothes
accessories lots of different things
online and for me and someone who my
body has changed so much my style
changes all the time and I think it's
amazing I can upload my clothing and the
things that I don't need or don't suit
me anymore to the app so if you guys
don't have the app I've got a link in
the description bar below you guys can
download it and I put a ton of stuff out
there and I'm going to show you some of
the stuff that I put now I put my first
ever Chanel bag this has actually
already been sold so I'm about to post
it to you after the video don't worry
and I think this is this has already
sold and this was my first ever Chanel
but the reality is I don't really wear
this bag anymore and I really do like it
it was one of the footnote it was the
first nail bag that I ever bought and
lots of people say keeper for grace and
stuff but I'm the person I'm not
sentimental about things like my mom
never had any things to pass down to me
besides wisdom and information and I
don't see me being the kind of mom who
hands down physical things however it
was really nice while I had it I loved
it also got this Alexander one jumper
I don't know it might have been sold it
might be so by now
but this is a one jumper when I'm
Alexander Wang did the collaboration
with H&amp;amp;M and I went crazy buying stuff
in the store and I only wore this jumper
one time also got the Alexander Wang
dress as well that came up hmm I never
wore this it still has the label on it
and I knew that I always wanted to sell
it but I never had the chance because I
just didn't get the time to do it but I
recently just updated my Deepak put all
the stuff that I wanted on it and I've
got loads and loads and loads of items
and my page I think is Patricia bright
so it will all be linked in the
description bar below
so my next fashion favorite is a bit of
a price pricy item okay so I'm not going
to say that everybody should go out and
get these but I wanted these but
absolutely ages so these are the
Valentino rock studs and these are
absolutely beautiful I've always wanted
these what I've never bought them and
every time I try and go in store to buy
them that out will stop and I actually
ended up picking them from the website
Farfetch'd traffic is absolutely amazing
for designer items because they've got
some of the unique pieces and they also
stores all over the world so you can get
lots of different items in different
sizes because whenever I try to get my
size in these I just couldn't get them
and these are just the classic rock
stars and they're gorgeous
and they're extremely extremely
comfortable that these are fantabulous
my final fashion favorite are my crate
Austrailia glasses you guys may know
that I went tomorrow color I think it
was last week I will have a look book
that will come out very soon and I wore
these and everybody was asking me where
are these from yes yes yes darling yes
and I really wanted the desi clap I'm
just gonna talk in the glasses yeah
let's just do that I'm sorry that
they're bit grimy hold on and I'm not
gonna die I really wanted the desi and
collaboration of crane and they had all
sold out sadly but I saw these and I was
like these are fly like I love these so
they have it sold out
I think I'll link them in the
description bar below but can find
now I thought they're just a really cool
pair of glasses like sleigh hey Patricia
you're so silly so next I'm going to
talk about some of my beauty favorites
and actually I'm going to start off with
a bit of personal care and I take a lot
of care of my teeth
ever since having you know braces on all
clear braces on and I have a wire
permanently in the back of my mouth now
for me it's really important to maintain
my teeth and healthcare because you only
have these one time only and I am an
electric toothbrush fan and I've got the
Philips Sonicare DiamondClean toothbrush
and when I tell you that this toothbrush
is everything there are no words to
describe actually how amazing this
toothbrush is this toothbrush is very
expensive I'm not even going to lie but
the way it makes my teeth look feel and
my whole mouth feel is amazing it's got
so many different settings from clean
white polish gum care and sensitive that
you can really give yourself a really
good brush and I found that initially I
found it a little bit too like too
vigorous you know when I use I was like
wow that's that's intense but I got used
to it and I can also change the settings
this has I feel has made my teeth look
whiter and these other two items are
also part of the collection I've got the
air floss and I found that the air Frost
is great now that I have the wire
because I have the wire I can't and get
the floss all the way up to the top of
my gums and the wires across my first
four teeth so this is great because it
basically shoots out water and it goes
into the gaps between your teeth and if
you're someone who doesn't really like
using the floss or you can this is redic
and then this is the tongue care tool
which you basically put onto the main
body of the brush and you can use this
to clean your tongue and I thought why
not have all three that go as part of
the collection they're excellent
excellent quality products and if you
care about your dental hygiene it's
worthwhile having a look at this and
investing in your teeth because you know
once this tooth is gone it ain't coming
back and you're going to end up being a
denture Queen for
I had links in the description bar below
to all of these products as well because
they are super cool okay this is random
and it might look ghetto but what it is
here is shea butter and if you don't
know my older sister she lives in my
jariyah and she came and she visited and
she brings me the shea butter from the
village you know the village shea butter
where the woman have pounded the butter
she brought this for me and I am telling
you that this is amazing like please
Nigeria can I have more shea butter and
I'm sure you can find shea butter
anywhere but there's something about it
coming from the original source that
makes it extra special and she had like
a big tub and I basically took a bunch
of it and put it into cling film and and
Grace has got basically baby acne or had
baby acne and has like flakes and stuff
on her eyebrows and I started to use
this on her face and also for cradle cap
it has cleared her face up like nothing
I've ever seen that it is so smooth
right so amazing I couldn't believe it
and then my sister has got four boys so
I never really talked about her but
she's amazing she has four boys and she
has no stretch marks and she basically
says the power is in the shea butter and
so I started using it on my stomach as
well as on my boobies as well because
they've got stretch marks on them and so
far so good
I really feel like my stomach is not as
stretch Marky as it was before and that
I'm looking a lot smoother another
Beauty favorite is my Tudor Beauty
lashes in Giselle and I'm sorry this is
just the empty packet because I have
worn the lashes to death
and then looking like spiders that are
dead on the windowsill somewhere but I
can tell you that these lashes are
absolutely fantastically gorgeous why
they say gorgeous these are the Giselle
Giselle number one I got them from cult
beauty and I'm just like please can I
have some more they are so gorgeous and
you guys know I'm a velour lash girl
like I wear the lower lashes like they
are going on
I wear them all the time but there was
something about these that were
absolutely fluttery and sexy and
carefree and just ah just beautiful
however I will say they do not last as
long as the the lower lashes but for
special occasions I will get these out
and I will treat them right my babies
cuz they are gorgeous another product I
wanted to talk about was the Nivea
cleansing facial wipes and I did work
with Nivea on another video on a paid
for partnership and I'm telling you that
even if I do pay for partnerships is
because I love the product I do not have
to come and show you the face wipes in
this video I use the product and I'm
telling you these face wipes are so good
they are like ridiculously good
especially because I use another face
wipe or I used to use another face right
of another brand and I use that for so
long because it was just one of the
classic ones you just use that one and
then I use this and I was like this is
so much better than that face work that
I've been using it's really moisturizing
it really does get your makeup off but
your face feels like it's had a little
bit of a treatment afterwards and I will
definitely vouch for these and say there
they are an excellent product so go near
VR and everyone can get them but I'm
very impressed
finally I have got some goodies from
colour-pop and and as you guys don't
know colour-pop are now shipping to the
UK and I got very carried away and got a
lot of items and they have got their new
ultra glossy lip products I look so many
of these and wearing the color right now
on my lips the color I'm wearing is
called thoughtful but I didn't even know
the color is called thoughtful what yeah
it's called thoughtful it's looking kind
of fatty kind of that it that's my
finance that I did but to be honest
colour-pop is so affordable I've got an
affordable face makeup coming really
really soon they're so affordable and
the colors are just really good I think
they're doing a great job and I am a big
massive fan of color pop so guys that is
it for me and my favorites I love you
all and I love sometimes just doing
product videos like this because it
gives you a chance to also have a chat
as well I don't know if you guys feel
the same way because sometimes I do
videos that a little bit structured and
I want to give you points that useful
and hacky but sometimes like this I can
just waffle on for like 25 minutes I
never know how long this video is I'm
sorry guys I was waffling but I will
link everything in the description below
I'm really excited to share lots more
videos with you if there's anything else
you want to see please do let me know in
the comments and I will get those over
to you and also make sure you follow me
on my snapchat and on my Instagram and

forgetting anything I know guys thank
