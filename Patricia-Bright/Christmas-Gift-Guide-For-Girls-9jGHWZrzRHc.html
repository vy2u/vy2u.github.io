sure you can tell I thought when it's
the first of December I'm gonna bring my
Christmas Gladrags out got the tree out
and I thought I'm gonna do some seasonal
stuff for you guys for the period of
Christmas and you're gonna get a couple
of extra videos from me and I'm just
gonna brush them out and enjoy this time
before the new year today I'm going to
do a Christmas gift guide for her based
on gifts that I would either like myself
or have bought myself or will get for
others and to be honest I'm not a big
Christmas gift person like I don't
really get many gifts or arcs for many
gifts and you know I rather give out
hugs and kisses but for those of you who
want an idea of what could you get them
out there then hopefully this video is
helpful and I'm gonna try and give away
as much as I possibly can in this video
to you guys and I'm gonna tell you how
to do that later on in the video so
let's start with makeup I must say when
my favorite brands is clingy when it
comes to Christmas gifts it's they don't
mess about like I feel like growing up
my mom always had like the miniature set
because she'd buy the products and then
you get the set and they're such good
quality and perfectly formed I couldn't
like bypass Clooney in this Christmas
and I've got the party favors gift set
and what I love about this set is
obviously you get a makeup bag I always
need a new makeup bag every year because
you know when the infant gets all about
you know powdery and messy but also just
the colors within this aren't amazing
you get a moisturizer you get a chubby
stick you get a nail polish you get an
eyeshadow palette I think you'll also
get eyeliners you get a lot of bang for
your buck in this case as well as the
case as well and they've also got their
whole lot of candy these are look really
good if you want to give them to like
your younger cousins or the younger
ladies in your family and or if you
wanted to use them as stocking fillers
so my next favorite gift set is the
Charlotte Tilbury oh the gift set is
amazing like her makeup is just so
beautiful
and it stopped only I think it stopped
only in Selfridges but you might be able
to get it on the her website where she's
got loads of tutorials but the thing
that literally threw me when I saw these
gift sets was the fact that you could
buy a look and I've never seen any other
Brad do something where you basically
can buy a whole look basically ten
different looks from the doctor Vita the
golden goddess and you can buy
everything in that look but it's very
very pricey so I didn't buy a whole look
I did get a gift box but you can just
get for instance a palette and a gloss
which is what I got and I got the dr.
beter palette which is just gorgeous
and I think the packages are so you know
sexy another favorite you know you can't
go wrong with Mac and Mac have their own
special editions that they come out that
come out during Christmas and you get my
little purse now I'm so so on the purse
initially I liked it and then I thought
it's a bit garish so I got the stroke of
midnight gift set which is all about the
nips where you have a beautiful lip
liner a lipstick and a cream machine lip
gloss and I think it was about 35 pounds
I absolutely love this I'm gonna be sad
when I run out because this lip liner is
probably one of the best - I've used
it's in the color Calvino so this is so
random but I do like receiving books for
Christmas
and this is super random but if you are
a fan of reality TV and Made in Chelsea
or if you know you definitely never go
who is a fan of reality TV that may make
the Chelsea actually have a Life &amp;amp; Style
essentials book which is actually quite
cool it's got some really gorgeous
pictures and clips from the shows and
then I think they're just more insight
into the individuals on there it's a
little bit tacky but it's one of those
things that you'd get someone who you
know is a superfan now this is where I
get excited it's the cookbooks and this
is the great British break off winter
kitchen and I love the great British
break off I don't know who does in I
don't bake like
don't know how to bake I don't have the
facilities to bake baking is not my
forte but I'm sure if I had this book on
bakery and I saw all these cakes I'll be
baking honey honey I'll be baking for
you Oh moving on and this is a book
called the luminaries and it was a
winner of the Man Booker Prize this was
recommended to me by my sister-in-law
who is currently reading it it's a book
about think about an Australian
prostitute and I was like wow it sounds
really intense and sometimes you want to
read some fiction but some fiction that
kind of cuts the heart and I thought
this book would be a really really
interesting novel and she just said it
was amazing I want to move on to body
items so for the girls who you know who
don't like makeup I'd like to have that
smooth and sexy body and skin I would
really recommend the Clinique deep
comfort range these moisturizers are
just slowly like moisturizing but these
are amazing they're so thick and like
warm but not greasy they're absolutely
lovely you really want to like get the
set you can get from the wash to the
moisturizer to the lotion and you can
get their hand cream as well so
definitely the deep moisture cream is a
great set if you're thinking of ways to
get something for the body so guys I
must let you know that I'm absolutely in
love with heels oh my gosh and they have
their Christmas limited edition set and
there's a face cream and the creme de
corpse and I think there's a couple of
other items in it as well but I love
these these smells absolutely gorgeous
and I am literally akyüz convert so
definitely pick up some of these goodies
because limited edition you're not going
to find them again so if you are looking
for something for someone who's a little
bit matura an auntie your mother
grandmother but someone who really cares
about glow I'm obsessed with glowing and
Clarins
is one of those just well-known staple
Browns you know what you're going to get
and you're going to get good good
quality
and they have the vital light day Queen
and they have the vital right night
cream as well and I think these are in
like the illuminating gift set and I
just think that these are great like for
my mom this is definitely her gift
Mamdouh watch this video because it's
just quality and a name that you can
definitely trust seeing as we're moving
into a world where we all love to take
selfies I find that basically I've got
thousands of pictures for moments on my
camera that I never print off that I
never have anywhere tangible and I love
the thought of and that no one goes and
processes films like in the shop or in
whatever you go to to process your
pictures from your camera but I love the
Fuji film it's the max 8 because one it
looks really really cool but I'm at my
sister-in-law's wedding she had this to
keep the memories of all the guests who
attended her weddings so she made any
will take a photo write their names on
it and it was stuck into a book and I
just actually loved the concept of
having the tangible item to keep forever
okay guys okay okay now this this has
got my name written all over it the
reason being is that I like spotting I
like being warm you know and I found
this thing called the blanket you can
wear and I was like yes that sounds just
like me and I bought home very coat UK
I'm going to put a link in the
description bar and we're to link
everything in the description bar but
this is the blanket you can wear and I'm
gonna wear it for you
but one it comes with a nice slug
snuggly little pouch right this and it's
from Lipsy yeah that's where it was from
nipsey and it's
let fall asleep right now it's so
snuggly and it's so warm and I'm go to
live in this for weeks
no I'm going to live in this throughout
winter it's basically like a big massive
dressing-gown but it's more of a
dressing-gown that's kind of like a
blankie kind of like ooh blankie blankie
and it's like really long it covers your
legs and it's so snuggly I might do the
rest of the video in this actually so
another item that I absolutely love off
folding cases and and not just your
normal phone cases phone cases that are
different I think you can get phone
cases that kind of represent who you are
and I love a website called icon nieces
they do some of the most gorgeous
artistic phone cases you've ever seen
and they're so so beautiful and I'm
gonna have quite a few of these actually
to give away I've got multiple different
designs so yeah finally it's your trusty
perfume you don't want to mess about
with the perfume perfume is always a way
to go and I love Marc Jacobs I have a
quick little bit of a collection go when
it comes to Marc Jacobs
but the Marc Jacobs honey I know it
looks very summery and stuff but why I
liked it was because it's a very gentle
it's more of a fresh smell and that's
just my own preference I don't like
anything that's like too heavy as I
smell and I really like this one so that
was that so guys I hoped you enjoyed
that video and as I said I'm going to do
a little giveaway for you guys and give
away as much if not all of what it was
in this video today all you need to do
