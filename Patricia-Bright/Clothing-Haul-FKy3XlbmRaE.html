and like a quick wedding update and
stuff for you I tried to record this
video before but I had cut off half of
my face so very annoying but I finally
picked my wedding dresses and yes I just
said wedding dresses because I bought
two wedding dresses and I know that's
just so Kim K of me you know but I
couldn't decide between the two because
in my mind I always thought I wanted you
know the whole mermaid trumpet-style
dress with a really long train and butt
and it looked gorgeous it suited me so
well and then I was actually let me try
something B let me try something to say
he comes the bride right and I found
this dress which I'm going to show you a
snippet of
you get the idea and so when you when I
get married I will show you I'm sorry I
wasn't able to film but designers don't
let you take pictures or Fiona dresses
and because a lot of people try and copy
them and yes I tried on this thing I
said Maureen him that my cousin would
like just try it just try it and I tried
it on the day before and my friend was
out on my gosh that is just too much
it's just so Gypsy Wedding blah blah
blah and then I tried it on and I get
out and they were just like oh my god
they loved it they absolutely loved it
my mom was like yes this is do warn this
is the one you actually not it as well
so I decided that I kind of still wanted
to have the yes I'm getting married the
Big Fat Gypsy Wedding the Kim K was down
the aisle dress and then I also wanted a
nice Hollywood style dress that's what
they call it and it's might have fitted
and a beautiful setting so I've got two
dresses that I'll be wearing and then
I'll be wearing my traditional Nigerian
wear in the evening so yeah a little
snippet of what that looks like
so let's get on to the hata firstly I
got this jacket from H&amp;amp;M and I hope you
can see it it's this right kind of furry
woolly GP jacket and it's really ed well
for me is really elegant I love the fact
that it's got the gray under the lapels
and because winters come in I need a
pink jacket at me you know you know
gotta have something pimp in and this is
not like a fur jacket it's a bit more
contained it's a bit more structured
which I really like kind of try and show
you it on but it's like really
structured and I think it looks very
Parisian
for the cold we really need this stuff
in the UK and then went to a pop
boutique and I picked up this waist belt
looks like that and I just liked it
because I liked the kind of a teen vibe
of this belt so look at this bar on with
this outfit it's so gorgeous and this is
like a pleated maxi skirt which my
sister bought but I think I'm gonna
steal it so I'm adding it into my whole
video glamour and then these are these
kind of body con suits which are from
Primark and I was inspired again by
Shirley to get this and it's in this
really kind of pinky minke color I also
went into Urban Outfitters they had a
bit of a sale going on and I picked up
this really nice kind of aztec tribal
Native American type necklace which it's
really pretty
and it was 410 pounds in the sale again
from Urban Outfitters I bought this big
lovely slouchy jumper with the holes in
it like that
that's really really nice and then um I
should have told you guys but urban my
other half is American Apparel had this
two-day warehouse sale where they have
stuff for 70% off it was crowded it
wasn't a huge warehouse in Shoreditch
and its case my friend came and joined
me and Shirley and then you know yeah
let's go down there got a few bits and
bobs and well some nicely
but did get that much but did get this
cutoff sleeve top and I think they do
this every year think last year heard
you have those fights and they needed
the police it was that bad but the
cutoff shirts which are usually about 35
pounds 40 pounds or something like that
they got this 212 pounds and I got it in
a nice mint color just cause to switch
it up a bit
and then I bought this lace t-shirt as
well which a bit look nice cinched in
with something and it's got the holes
and stuff in that and I bought that for
10 pounds I have to be honest this
really isn't shouldn't meet my hole but
it is and I ended up being inspired by
so totally vlog she's getting married as
well in 2014
this girl is prepared but she is
prepared I've been engaged for like four
months
she has been engaged with mom she's got
all the magazines she's got a book she's
got cutout she's got stickers she's got
everything she's got wedding everything
and I just look at myself oh my gosh and
get some of this stuff so ended up
picking up cosmopolitan bride why don't
my disease no expensive these are like
four pounds but there's a few ideas in
there not that many oh my gosh the dress
but my dress was in that place not okay
and then this cosmopolitan Bride
Magazine came with it which has the
great escapes ideas of wedding locations
to go to and a lot of you guys have
mentioned Fiji and Bora Bora it's a
shame that that's on the other side of
the world and I'm not going to go on a
24 hour flights but it gives me some
good ideas the Maldives are looking good
to me my vow now and I also bought this
bridal magazine this is the best-selling
one by cond√© nast good right and then
finally from Topshop I bought this this
dress which is from Motel and it's like
some kind of like a ballerina dress but
I really that the lace of what the lace
is quite sexy you know
and then the bra roster at the bottom
it's quite short and I got it in an
extra small I'm not sure why but it fits
fine so it's that
so guys that is the end of my whole
there's not much there but I hope you
enjoyed it bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
