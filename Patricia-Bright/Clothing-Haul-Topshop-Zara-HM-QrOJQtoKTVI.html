going to do this anymore but i haven't
done one for like three months or
something like that I think it's been
that long and I have recently purchased
what is that it's a nice cool Oh
screaming so yeah wasn't meant to do a
whole but you know I've been hauling so
basic I'm just going to do the whole
anyway and it's kind of like a
collective haul just the things that i
purchased over the coming months and you
would have seen like the past month
sorry you've seen some of these features
so I'm just gonna go ahead and get
started so first of all is this bag but
I bought in monkey kind of neck and navy
bed you might have seen it in videos and
it's just really simple I've kind of
needed like a small bags I've got really
big bags but just something I can just
throw of my shoulder color like a mini
satchel type bag kind of pins like that
it was 18 pounds from monkey I kind of
had a little denim denim obsession of
late and I bought this denim kind of
waistcoat II Jacket thing from monkey
again and what I did have actually
bought it in the medium I think it's a
bit too big i'll probably go back and
get a small and it's just nice to kind
of throw on and add a bit of edge to a
few outfits that was 20 pounds monkeys
really good prize they found so i also
bought these trousers these kind of kind
of blue trousers i'm over like a denim
like a blue denim rather than normal
denim but they're really really nice the
really thick and they were 25 pounds
they fit quite well other than the fact
that they're not that skinny Oh at the
bottom kind of like Topshop jeans are
done really really well you want them
skinny at the ankle they're skinny at
the ankle these don't quite hit the mark
on that but that they would do they've
all right so i also bought this white
car d as well for monkey and it's kind
of like a long kind of drapey like i'm
just going to throw this on i really
like this top and i also bought this
lipid is this leopard cheetah cheetah
print that's so Pat butcher you know
path butcher and some of you and
probably looking at the coop a butcher
is google it Pat butcher very bad hi I
thought it's kind of nice just add a
little bit of flair to an outfit
sometimes and I need
I always wear block colours so I just
wanted something that was a bit
different so you guys have seen this top
featured at an absolute lot and it's
this lace top which is actually from the
H&amp;amp;M conscious connection and I just love
it like I just love it it's see-through
it's lacy it's really pretty someone
said they didn't like it I love it and
that was 25 pounds of H in him it's a
little bit steep I think it's worth it
you also bought these shorts which
you've probably seen everywhere the part
of the conscious collection again
they're kind of just a loose baggy pair
of shorts hopefully when the weather
improves I can wear them i also bought
this this kind of live is it line this
kind of I don't know what coloreds call
it let's just call it green baby green
it's baby green pencil skirt from H&amp;amp;M so
food was pretty and very very spring
very very pastel and the thing that was
just like 19 pounds so recently right
mean topshop I've been doing the rounds
we have become quite close and bought
these shoes above these shoes then they
kind of got gold at the front perspex at
the side and I don't know this is like a
suede at the back they were 28 pounds
they're extremely comfortable on I think
they're really really cute I am I don't
really wear heels it naturally that's a
lie I do wear heels but I want more
flats like nice pretty flat so i can
wear so that's why i bought them and i
will support these flats and i just
thought i had that these in the black
and but without the start i bought them
in the peach with the studs because i
thought there it's a lot more spring
summary and i want something a bit more
light i really want to get more lighter
clothes let alone the fact that i
haven't shopped for my new job so i'm
gonna do that very soon maybe i'll take
you along with me if you'll come with me
shopping for new clothes let me know he
also went to a brush bar and i bought
this skirt this pencil skirt I want to
do something which this watch will
feature this skirt in it at some point
but it's really pretty kind of as techy
as well I love that absolutely love it
and very springy
so um few accessories that purchase this
chain here this is from Topshop this was
in the sale it's really pretty it's got
like a cross on it a feather do some
little balls and it's like on a thin
chain and it's quite nice and short so I
really really like this chain and I
think there's only three pounds fifty
like it's going to do this out but not
gonna bother so also bought this bangle
bangle bracelet from how do you say is
it bangle bracelet leave let me know
leave a comment I don't know and this
bracelet from Topshop bites from the
gogo philip range and this was five
pounds or three pounds fifty on sale
really pretty looks really good with
like my watch r it together irene like
the way that looks and then i also
bought this kind of chunky metallic and
bracelet from leather Philip it's quite
nice kind of cherry but I quite liked it
so I bought this as well from Topshop I
don't know what it was about it it made
me feel like the sheriff and I said yes
I am the sheriff and you just kind of
pin it up to your shirt and that was
like three pounds fifty or something so
i bought this dress as well this kind of
oh gosh i'm really pat butcher on though
right now i bought this dress and it's
kind of in the cheetah print again and
it's like a bodycon dress and I really
really like it it reminds me something
of something that love and was wearing
in the only way is essex if you see like
last season or something and like not
that i would like to look like an essex
girl i think that this could really be
transformed into something really quite
elegant and really quite kid I don't
know laughter that was actually only 29
pounds so maybe 29 pounds from Topshop
that's actually really good so I'm
really trying to do more patterns and
stuff like that so I bought another
skirt here and it's kind of like weirdly
patented it's patterned from Topshop
there
i bought these genes from topshop i
bought these genes from topshop i love
them because i think they're perfectly
like perfect for for summer for
spring/summer kind of striped blue and I
think they're definitely a statement
piece I actually picked up in a size 12
because I couldn't get a smaller size
but they're the kind of Lee jeans are so
thin that actually it looks better you
don't like I don't like jeans that look
or tight up on my skin and then I bought
this like crop top and I don't like it
very much actually I probably going to
take it back it's quite choppy i don't
know why i bought it i was probably
still in a holiday mood I thought I
could wear this no I got worried it's
kind of got neon pink go around me I
don't know do you think it's wearable
what would I wear this with I don't know
we'll see I can't be bothered to take
you back to your nice so we'll see then
i also bought this gorgeous pretty
pretty dress it's it reminds us
something that kind of like I don't know
it's really asian to me delay is that a
bad thing to say now it's just kind of
pretty and like Kitsch and I think it
looks really cute and that's from top
then that was 55 pounds and i bought
this jeff forgot the stuff I bought you
know key imagine and this chain here
which kind of looks like a collar that
was 15 pounds that's really nice i don't
know i'm gonna wear it with yet but i
think it's got a lot of opportunity okay
