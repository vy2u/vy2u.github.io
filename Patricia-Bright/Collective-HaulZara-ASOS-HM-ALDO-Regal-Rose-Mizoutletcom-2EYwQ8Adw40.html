video is gonna be a quick haul I wanted
to say I've kind of chain use away my
approach to shopping and stuff like that
because YouTube can sometimes make you
feel like shopping like a mad person but
and I decided I'm gonna do monthly hauls
and what I'm gonna do I'm only gonna buy
it key pieces that I can definitely say
are worth having in my wardrobe I'm not
gonna buy things because they're trendy
or because I saw someone on YouTube with
it which does often happen so yeah just
key pieces I hope you guys can like join
me on this monthly whore thing where it
might only be four items a month it
could be eight items but it should never
be more than that other than today this
time but you know if you see me do more
than one haul in a month tell me off I'm
not good to do that so hopefully you can
see what I pick up monthly which I call
like a key or an essential right cuz of
you ask all my links are down below I've
got my Facebook page I've got my Twitter
page and do come over leave me questions
and video ideas because it really does
definitely help me so I'm just gonna get
started and show you some of the best
that I've gotten this I went to Primark
and I basically only picked up three
items there and for those of you who
don't know I'm going to Spain Oh
Spain so yes we decided on going on a
little city excursion to Spain so I
thought it's gonna be hot and I think
one of those like essentials I like what
do you call them one pieces so I bought
this and it was nice colors it suits me
really well and I think if I'm wearing a
costume I can just fling this over it
and that was only ten piece and it's got
ten pounds and it's like culottes like
that and it's really pretty I think this
will look lovely like on the beach and
just in a city where it's sunny and they
also picked up this like button things
that I think a really basic and really
classic now as well so I picked up this
shirt which has the this kind of collar
detail as well and it's like a chiffon
with pleats all the way down and what I
like about this is that it looks really
nice tucked in but also looks really
nice of just some plain leggings just
kind of hanging over as well with high
heels I love this so yes that was
I also went into Zara and I picked up a
few accessories and again it's all about
key items to me and all things that are
a statement you know that you can just
add to your wardrobe as classic pieces
so I picked up these yellow kind of
mustardy shoes and they're a peep toe
and what I like is that the peep toe
isn't at massive I hate where you can
literally see whole foot from the front
it just doesn't look good
I just might showing two little tiny
toenails like at the top and it's kind
of a platform and it's got this really
cool wraparound and cool thing as well
and it is suede so I wouldn't want to
wear them all the time but I did wear
them when I interviewed Whitney port
which you might see very soon so I felt
really good and like jeans and these
just a statement he'll to add to like a
plain outfit and they were about 45
pounds maybe or maybe 50 so guys an
absolute bargain I picked up and it's
this bag here this bag here was 20
pounds unbelievable price for Zara bag
it's basically a crossbody bag it
genuinely it looks like real leather
it's not shiny it's not plastic II it's
really really soft and really really mad
very very nice I love this bag and it's
got rose gold hardware can you imagine
can you see that I hope you can see it's
a rose girl people so with a Michael
Kors watch or another rose gold watch
absolutely gorgeous 20 pounds bro
basically I hate red but I did another
interview as well and I was like you
know what I want to be bright it's been
fairly grey recently and I thought if I
get a red jumper with some jewelry and
stuff like that it just adds a bit of
sunshine to like the gray atmosphere and
you guys say sweater so for the world
the guys in the States a sweater so I
mean a sweater and it's like a really
lovely soft kind of material and all of
a sudden I've got this night this thing
for higher necks and round necklines
like this and it really does have that
and that was only 15 pound and finally
you my amazing piece from Zara I was is
this crochet this croche this quilted
leather jacket it's not leather it's
pleather but it looks like it's actual
leather it's matte really really matte
really really well-made I bought one
before that was shiny but I took it back
because it was just a bit too shiny
whereas this is perfect I've worn this
like every day basically and it's got
this like ruching at the sides I'm not
sure if you can see that and it's got
the quilt in all throughout and I think
it makes it look so expensive if I want
to study it or put anything on it guys I
got some bits from Regal rose and I've
been eyeing up their stuff for ages I've
seen and reviews and other people get
their stuff about oh my garter Eagle
rose and I did get some stuff from there
and they're packaged in it is absolutely
is so cute and it's just so eco-friendly
I just love it and you know you get
these ones or you get the little gold
box this has got my earrings in it so
I'll show you the bits that I've got in
there
so I picked up this little oh if you
follow me on instagram you'll be able to
see my like tweets where it showed the
stuff that I've had on them so Instagram
and Twitter me you'll be able to see so
I picked up these earrings which are
peace sign earrings and I got them in
the gold in the silver I think they're
both you get both the gold and the
silver together and they're are so
absolutely cute I hate wearing earrings
quite regularly because as well they
make me look like very ghetto I don't
know what it is but those are just so
elegant normally I wear my hair up
absolutely perfect so I picked up this
chain it is a an antique kind of
metallic chain and it's got this is like
silver dirty old silver and then you
have the gold little bullets that are
hanging as well but if you can see how
cute it is session of the high neck top
and I definitely am loving the whole
layering of necklaces so got that they
also picked up this vintage link chain
as well that's really pretty and I'm
loving short chunky chains like so cute
and their prices are really good as well
I think and then I also bought this like
really random thing I want to do more
hair tutorials but I picked up herrings
they look kind of hobo ish when they're
on what you have
a messy braid and then you stick them in
the braid but they are so cute and so
unique and I think for a different kind
of hair is too accessory rather than
like floral hair accessories herrings
are definitely an amazing option if you
want me to I'll do a tutorial just leave
a comment below and I'll do that
I hope this haul is not too long sorry
so from a source I got a few bits this
lucky sent from a sauce that is so cute
to all to do with the whole galaxy
upgrade stuff and I think that I'm not
sure if they gave us all the same stuff
but it was really cool stuff so it was
this chain and basically that you wear
on a shirt and you kind of attach it to
your colors or something or underneath
there I thought that was so unique
because I wouldn't have picked up
something like this myself but having it
I'm like oh my gosh how cute is that
they also sent me a white shirt now I
understand why they sent me this because
everyone I was speaking to in the whole
like fashion world is like white shirts
white shirts white shirt and I can see
exactly why they're classic pieces that
you add things over it to look amazing
and when I interviewed Naomi Anderson
she literally picked up a white shirt
from one of the shops that sells school
uniform to get the perfectly fitting
white shirt so definitely go and check
it out on a zorse all your local school
shop for these bits I bought myself it's
this crop top here which is from yes
from a US and it's just plain white crop
top but it's really nice material I'm
gonna do a DIY on this like a bit
tie-dye or make me a dye something with
this so watch out for that will be very
interesting and if you guys are see me
tweeting tweeting on this a lot you'll
always see me kind of showing it I've
been in this alone and it's this Aztec
outfit which is from Motel and it was
like 11 pounds or 17 pounds or something
like that
and absolutely gorgeous absolutely
perfect for summer spring and things
like that and I also bought it in the
Striped as well and I
love it fits so well and I love Motel
because this stuff is so feminine but on
trend as well I think they do stuff that
really suit like women's figures they
also picked up this yellow bag as well
and I love it from a dolls it's so that
it doesn't I hate things that look like
fake liver it's not real never but it is
being like like crunch crunch like
scratch or something not scratch but
it's like embossed it feels really
really good
it looks really matte not shiny at all
and I think it's perfect for something
so I also bought these wedges from Aldo
but because I've got the Zara shoes I'm
like I'm probably not gonna keep these
anymore I'm probably gonna just take
these back because I don't really need
them now I bought them before the Zara
ones and they're wedges and the yellows
a bit stronger and the toe bits a bit
wider but I think it's quite good
sorry I'm a bit all over their boots
because there's someone in the garden
watching so final fashion item is this
little Chanel jacket that I picked up
from H&amp;amp;M and I'm calling it Chanel
jacket because I always find these Asian
girls who are always wearing these
little jackets all the time like where
do you guys get these jackets from but I
got one of these is it crochet I don't
know if it's crochet it's like
tweet-tweet material in pink and it's so
cute and it's got the black lining and
it's also got the pockets yes the
classic pockets absolutely perfect so
finally I got a ton of stuff from Miss
outlet calm a ton of stuff now false
eyelashes like I always wear false
eyelashes and wear false eyelashes now
they're expensive they're like iron law
eyelashes are like 5 pounds of pack and
it you know they don't last forever so I
just liked you know what let me find
something else and I found found miss
outlet calm it's based in the States but
they sent me loads of stuff like within
3 or 4 days I think it's definitely
worth it I tried a BAE lashes as well
they were crap they looked really
plasticky but these are the ones that
are human hair and they just come out
really nice and I
can't show you how many lashes I have I
have like loads loads no but I could
show you all the amount of lashes I
picked up but for me it's worth it like
getting a big load of lashes and then
trying to show you I've got more than
this I've got like four times this many
but a whole load of eyelashes that quite
good and the ones that I'm liking the
most of these the butterfly ones they're
one dollar seventy nine that's about
like 70 P maybe no yeah about 80 P for a
set of eyelashes okay they're amazing
they're really really soft they're not
shiny plastic and then the bar is really
really thin and this is from Miss outlet
calm I'll put all the links below as
well as also got a few bits from they've
got jewelry and stuff on there so I've
got this bracelet and also some like
packages to put my eyelashes in because
I got basically this box full of lashes
and stuff so yeah I'm gonna need a
pretty way to store them so guys I think
that's it
that is a very extensive haul I'll be
doing hauls monthly and they'll be good
holds okay they will be good hugs no
more bag or lay no more rubbish haulin
