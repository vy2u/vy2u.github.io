today's video is going to be a quick
hall I want to say I kind of changed
away at my approach to shopping and
stuff like that because YouTube can
sometimes make you feel like shopping
like a mad person but and I decided I'm
gonna do monthly halls and what i'm
gonna do i'm only gonna buy key pieces
that I can definitely say are worth
having in my wardrobe I'm not gonna buy
things because they're trendy or because
I saw someone on youtube with it which
does often happen so yeah just keep
pieces I hope you guys can join me on
this monthly whore thing where it might
only be four items a month it could be
eight items but it should never be more
than that other than today this time but
you know if you see me do more than one
haul in a month tell me off I'm not good
to do that so hopefully you can see what
I pick up monthly which I call like a
key or an essential like those of you
ask all my links are down below I've got
my facebook page I've got my Twitter
page and do come over leave me questions
and video ideas because it really does
definitely helped me so I'm just gonna
get started and show you some of the
bits that I've gotten this I went to
Primark and I basically only picked up
three items there and for those of you
who don't know I'm going to Spain Oh
Spain so yes and we decided on going on
a little city excursion to Spain so I
thought it's going to be hot and I think
one of those like essentials I like what
you call them one piece is and so I
bought this and it was nice colors it
suits me really well and I think if I'm
wearing a costume i can just fling this
over it and that was only ten peaks and
it's got 10 pounds and it's like
culottes like that and it's really
pretty I think this will look lovely
like on the beach and just in a city
where it's sunny they also picked up
this like I'm buying things that I think
a really basic and really classic now as
well so I picked up this shirt which has
the this kind of collar detail as well
and it's like a chiffon with pleats all
the way down and what I like about this
is that it looks really nice tucked in
but also looks really nice of just some
plain leggings just kind of hanging over
is well with high heels
love this so yes that was 10 pounds as
Waterloo I also went into czar bar and I
picked up a few accessories in again
it's all about key items to me and all
things that are a statement you know
that you can just add to your wardrobe
as classic pieces so I picked up these
yellow kind of mustardy shoes and
there's a Piton what I like is that the
peak tone isn't at massive I hate where
you can literally see whole foot from
the front it just doesn't look good I
just like showing two little tiny
toenails like at the top and it's kind
of a platform and it's got this really
cool wrap round and cool thing as well
and it is suede so I wouldn't wanna wear
them all the time but I did wear them
when i interviewed whitney port which
you might see very soon so i felt really
good and like jeans and these just a
statement hill to add to like a plain
outfit and they were about 45 pounds
maybe or maybe 50 so guys an absolute
bargain i picked up and it's this bag
here this bag here was twenty pound
unbelievable price for zara bag it's
basically a crossbody bag it genuinely
it looks like real leather it's not
shiny it's not plasticky it's really
really soft and really really mad very
very nice I love this bag and it's got
rose gold hardware can you imagine can
you see that I hope you can see it's a
rose girl people so with a michael kors
watch or another rose gold watch
absolutely gorgeous 20 pounds bro
basically i hate red but i did another
interview as well and I said you know
what I want to be bright it's been
fairly gray recently and I thought if I
get a red jumper with some jewelry and
stuff like that it just adds a bit of
sunshine to like the great atmosphere
and you guys say sweat out of all the
guys in the States a sweater so I mean a
sweater and it's like a really lovely
soft kind of material and all of a
sudden I've got this night this thing
for higher next and round neck lines
like this and it really does have that
and that was only 15 pound and finally
my amazing
these forms are I was is this crochet
this crochet this quilted leather jacket
it's not leather it's pleather but it
looks like it's actual leather it's matt
really really mad really really well
made i bought one before that was shiny
but i took it back because it was just a
bit too shiny whereas this is perfect
I've worn this like everyday basically
and it's got this like ruching at the
side I'm not sure if you can see that
and it's got the quilt in all throughout
and I think it makes it look so
expensive if I want to study it or put
anything on it sighs I got some bits
from regal rose and I've been eyeing up
their stuff for ages I've seen reviews
and other people getting stuff about all
my garter eagle road and I did get some
stuff from there and they're packaged in
it absolutely is so cute and it's just
so eco-friendly I just love it and you
know you get these ones or you get the
little gold box this has got my earrings
in it so i'll show you the bits that
I've got in there so i picked up this
little oh and if you follow me on
instagram you'll be able to see my like
tweets where showed the stuff I've had
on them so Instagram and Twitter me
you'll be able to see so I picked up
these earrings which are peace sign
earrings and I got them in the gold and
silver I think they're both you get both
the gold and the silver together and
there are so absolutely cute I hate
wearing earrings quite regularly because
that's what they make me look like very
ghetto I don't know what it is but those
are just so elegant normally I wear my
hair up absolutely perfect so I picked
up this chain it is a an antique kind of
metallic chain and it's got this is like
silver dirty old silver and then you
have the gold little bullets that are
hanging as well don't know if you can
see how cute it is socially the high
neck top and I definitely am loving the
whole layering of necklaces forgot that
they also picked up this vintage link
chain as well that's really pretty and
then I'm loving short chunky chains like
so cute and their prices are really good
as well I think and then I also bought
this like really random thing I want to
do more hair tutorials but I picked up
Herring's they look kind of hobo ish
when they're on might you have felt like
a messy braid and then you stick them in
the braid but they are so cute and so
unique and I think four different kind
of hair is to accessory rather than like
floral hair accessories herrings are
definitely an amazing option if you want
me to out do a tutorial just leave a
comment below and I'll do that I hope
this hauls not too long sorry so from a
source I got a few bits and this lucky
sent from a sauce that is so cute and to
alter do the whole galaxy upgrade stuff
and i think that i'm not sure if they
gave us all the same stuff but it was
really cool stuff so it was this chain
and basically that you wear on a shirt
and you kind of attach it to your colors
or something or underneath there i
thought that was so unique because i
wouldn't have picked up something like
this myself but having it I'm like oh my
gosh how cute is that they've also sent
me a white shirt now I understand why
they sent me this because everyone I'm
speaking to in the whole like fashion
world is like white shirts white shirts
white shirt and I can see exactly why
they're classic pieces that you add
things over it to look amazing and when
i interviewed leo me anderson she
literally picked up a white shirt from
one of the shops that sells school
uniform to get the perfectly fitting
white shirt so definitely go and check
it out on a zorse all your local school
shop for these bits i bought myself and
it's this crop top here which is from
yes from a dose and it's just plain
white crop top but it's really nice
material i'm gonna do a DIY on this like
a bit tired I or maybe a dye something
with this so watch out for that will be
very interesting and if you guys are see
me tweeting tweeting on this a lot you
always see me kind of showing it I've
been in this alone and it's this Aztec
outfit which is for motel and it was
like 11 pounds or 17 pounds or something
like that and absolutely gorgeous
absolutely perfect for summer spring and
things like that and I also bought it in
the striped as well
and i love it fits so well and i love
motel because this stuff is so feminine
but on trend as well I think they do
stuff that really suit like women's
figures they also picked up this yellow
bag as well and i love it from a dolls
it's so that it doesn't i hate things
that look like fake allah but it's not
real leather but it is being like like
crunch crunch like scratch or something
not scratch but it's like embossed it
feels really really good it looks really
mad not shiny at all and i think it's
perfect for summer so i also bought
these wedges from aldo but because I've
got the zara shoes and like i'm probably
not going to keep these anymore i'm
probably gonna just take these back
because i don't we need them now i
bought them before the zara one's a
little wedges and the yellows a bit
stronger and the toub it's a bit wider
but i think it's quite good like that
sorry I'm a bit all over there because
there's someone in the garden watching
so final fashion item is this little
Chanel jacket that I picked up from H&amp;amp;M
I'm i'm calling it Chanel jacket because
i always find these asian girls who are
always wearing these little jackets all
the time like where do you guys get
these jackets from but i got one of
these is it crochet i don't know if it's
crochet it's like twee twee type
material in pink and it's so cute and
it's got the black lining and it's also
got the pocket yes the classic pocket
absolutely perfect so finally i got a
ton of stuff from Miss outlet calm a ton
of stuff now false eyelashes like I
always wear false eyelashes and wear
false eyelashes now and they're
expensive they're like aisle or
eyelashes are like five pounds a pack
and it you know they don't last forever
so I just liked you know let me find
something else and I found found miss
outlet calm it's based in the States but
they sent me loads of stuff like within
three or four days I think it's
definitely worth it I tried ebay lashes
as well they were crap they look really
plasticky but these are the ones that
are human hair and they just come out
really nice and I can't show you how
many lashes I have
have like loads loads no like I could
show you all the amount of lashes I
picked up but for me it's worth it like
getting a big load lashes and then try
to show you I've got more than this I've
got like four times this many but a
whole load of eyelashes that quite good
and the ones that I'm liking the most of
these the butterfly one there one dollar
79 that's about like 70 p maybe know yet
about ATP for a set of eyelashes okay
they're amazing they're really really
soft and not shiny plastic and the bar
is really really thin and this is one
miss outlet calm I'll put all the links
below as well as also got a few bits but
they've got jewelry and stuff on there
so I've got this bracelet and also some
like packages to put my eyelashes in
because I got basically this box full of
lashes and stuff so yeah I'm going to
need a pretty way to store them so guys
I think that's it that is a very
extensive hall i'll be doing halls
monthly and they'll be good holds okay
they will be good hugs no more bad
horley no more rubbish hauling good
things do you think like picked up good
things this time not just random bits
