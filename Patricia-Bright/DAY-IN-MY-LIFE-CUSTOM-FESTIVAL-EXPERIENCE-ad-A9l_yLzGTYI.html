life video and I'm sharing with you my
festival experience I had the chance to
customize my festival experience with
Levi's and I just decided to share this
video with you guys I hope you enjoy so
when it comes to a festival look for me
I always go for a pair of cutoff jeans
these are a pair of Levi's 550's
I think every jeans before and they were
cut into a pair of shorts which I
totally love that look as I was going
with Levi's I decided to go to the store
to basically get some customization done
they have the Levi's tailor shop which
you can find across the country where
you can basically get lots of things
down to your old and new Levi's item
from rips to stud in to monogramming
there's so many different things you can
do to personalize your look and I'll be
honest it's super affordable and I ended
up picking up a new jacket as well and
getting some studs put onto it so the
morning I was very excited to make my
way to Bristol I was running a little
bit late and that's why I left basically
without any makeup on but my first
choice of my experience was whether not
to get a taxi or train to Paddington I
decided on the taxi because yeah I was
not feeling between that morning and I
chose Bristol because I just loved the
lineup and I heard it's a beautiful city
and I loved getting a train across like
England and I guess my makeup on the
train because you know what I'm like I'm
last-minute calm
so this is my first time in Bristol and
I must say I thought that this is she
was absolutely gorgeous I'm surprised
I've never been here before
and I had the choice to either get on
the love bus to the festival or to get
on the bike but I decided that I'd get
on the bike and I'm not you know the
most confident rider at all that's like
miles behind Michael but it's nice to
just taking the sights and the sounds
when I'm going somewhere that I've never
been before and I had so much fun so
when I got there there were so many
people I was just so excited to be there
and ended up seeing so many of you guys
and I had to say hello to everyone and
just setting in and have a good time
so you guys know that I absolutely love
my food and I was not disappointed there
were so many things to choose from it
was hard for me to make the right choice
until I saw the Caribbean jet chicken
and they have rice peas and plantain and
I know that that's what I had to go for
I always crave that good stuff so I have
to choose between stages or activities
to start off with I decided to go for
activities I found myself on this right
here and I feel like a big kid I was not
checked in the whole way and then roller
skating not that I'm any good at skating
but I just was nice having a little bit
of fun before seeing some of the act for
me festival style is such a personal
thing and I loved that I was able to
customize my outfit and add a little bit
of touches that were just me which is
quite simple and laid-back and it was so
inspiring just to see what everyone did
with their looks while we were there so
the one thing I couldn't wait to do was
actually to get my like face makeup done
I loved the way that everyone had kind
of chosen their Robin kind of facial
designs that met their personalities and
I was like gold purple all that kind of
good stuff
and I love what this lady did within
like five minutes I felt so gorgeous and
like best of all ready so there were
lots of stages to choose from but one
thing that you guys may not know about
me is that I love UK grime and dubstep
noon general was there and I was like I
have to definitely see those guys so I
made the choice to go to the cloud 10
and just see them at performed I loved d
EE but my favourite artist and yeah I
just had a really good time and then
made my way to like the drum and bass
stage and just partied away basically so
guys that is basically it for my custom
festive experience thank you to Levis
for bringing me out I had an amazing
time and I hope you guys enjoyed and I'm
getting ready for the festival season
anyway guys I'll see you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
