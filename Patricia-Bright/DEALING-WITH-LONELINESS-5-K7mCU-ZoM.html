talk on the topic of loneliness and I
wanted to talk about this because as
times where I feel lonely you know and
I've realized that we're living in a
world where sometimes you can feel very
very alone that you don't really have
friends that you don't really have
anyone like who do you confide in and
I'm lucky I'm married and but it doesn't
stop sometimes just a feeling of
loneliness and for those who don't have
partners and who don't have like big
families to turn to and stuff there's
this sense of oh my gosh like I'm so
alone sometimes you can feel really
secluded but you go home and you're
switching the TV or you watch YouTube
and that's just it for you you have no
one to pick up the phone to you go
somewhere and you're like no one's gonna
come with me I'm gonna go then I'm not
gonna go no anyone all right and you
just can get over well with this like
consumption of I'm not doing anything
and when we live in a world where
literally everyone parading their
amazing lifestyles on social media and
YouTube and the internet you can feel
like so so left out when I came today to
tell you girls that don't feel no way
about your loneliness it's okay to be
alone and I'm gonna teach you guys well
I'm gonna talk about how to actually
enjoy your own company and to be
confident and to be able to walk into a
room when you're by yourself or to do
something even if you're alone and just
feel confident in that there's no point
in being worried about how little few
friends that you do have whatever there
is no point in that you better learn to
love yourself so the first thing I
really want to tell you guys is about
learning to encourage yourself you have
to learn to encourage yourself
and when I say encourage yourself I mean
like it sounds creepy sounds a bit talk
to yourself and I always say this guy's
but when you talk to yourself and you
encourage yourself and you speak good
things about yourself he said I look
nice in this talk my hair looks nice
today you learn to speak to yourself and
you to encourage shorts off that you
don't need encouragement and someone
else to compliment you will tell you
about yourself so
learn to encourage yourself and I always
say as the song that logo sing it for
you
okay maybe not learn to encourage
yourself speak to yourself speak over
yourself and even when things aren't
going right you know try and use
positive words like positive words
really make you feel better so I'm going
to give you a moment right now in this
video to to stop and just give yourself
say five great things about yourself and
I'm sure there are five great things you
can find not just about the way you look
it might be the way you do something
might be the way cook something like the
way you smell something I don't know
what it is but take a little moment and
say a couple of great things about
yourself so the next thing you want to
do is to develop yourself rather than
wasting time in criticizing yourself or
moaning and saying I'm so alone whatever
like that you should invest in yourself
don't take away add to yourself choose
to do something you've never done before
learn a language cook a new dish go to a
regular exercise class or as knitting
class or or something that adds to you
read books read books that are positive
spend the time to invest in yourself and
learn a skill and if you feel lonely and
I'm confident in that skill that you
develop you're either going to meet
people while you're doing it or you're
going to be really proud and excited and
share with people and people going to
think you're super cool and if not oh
well you've got that skill do something
with yourself you know don't sit down
just wasting time and being mopey about
stuff just develop yourself rather than
taking away from yourself so I can talk
about me me me or you you you but one of
the best ways to deal with loneliness is
to basically be selfless invest in
others like do something for someone
else do something for a family friend do
something for your mom do something for
your dad do something for your school do
something like just do something for
someone else do something for a cat or a
dog literally but the time you are able
to focus your love and your energy on
something or someone else you will stop
thinking about how lonely you feel
another thing I say is stop observing
and start living I found I was doing
this lot and I found that I was
comparing myself to people and I feel
like you know can people people who are
doing such fun things and I'm not doing
anything in there having fun and blah
blah blah and I was like why am I
sitting here observing other people and
what they're doing but when you observe
you're not developing yourself you're
not doing anything for yourself
instead of observing and being worried
about other people's life start living
there's no point in dwelling on I
haven't got this I haven't done this I
haven't got those friends I love blah
blah blah don't bother with that start
for making making opportunities for
yourself start reading start doing
things for yourself and forget the
observation finally if you're not happy
with the loneliness get out there get
out there meet people do stuff get a job
you'll make friends at work go fly a
ring or campaigning or join a society or
join a group because there's a lot of
people out there you need to understand
that you're not alone work out what
you're interested in and find other
people are interested in the same things
as you from me I love mug games of
Thrones there are lots of games of
Thrones fans out there there are online
forums there's YouTube there's so many
things that can really help you and if
you ever feel lonely or you don't know
anyone because to be totally honest with
you there's a whole world out there of
people who feel just the way and they
probably need you to come and connect
with them so I really hoped you enjoyed
that video and I hope it encouraged you
I just felt like it's just time to just
share a little bit I'm so sorry about
the sunlight it's just you know I don't
own or control the Sun it's kind of
crazy like that I had to just close the
curtain there but if there are any other
topics so anything you want me to have a
little chat about please let me know

am i glowing now it's iridescent right
the Lord shine is light upon my face
sometimes you have to encourage you say
sometimes you got to speak victory
during the taste and no matter how it
feels speak a word over yourself and you
will be you speak over yourself
encourage yourself in the Lord
