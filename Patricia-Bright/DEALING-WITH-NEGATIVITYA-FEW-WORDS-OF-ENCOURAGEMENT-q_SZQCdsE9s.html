didn't necessarily know what I wanted to
do the vlog on but I knew it had to do
with staying positive or dealing with
negativity and I don't prepare my videos
in the van so I'm just going to talk as
I enjoy talking but I think this is
based on things that I've been facing
the recently given the time in my life
that I've been very very stressed out
and sometimes you can just feel really
really negative and I know there are
people out there who may feel negative
about this situation not know what's
gonna happen next what do I do next
oh my gosh this looks awful how do I
deal with this what do I do
where do I turn to and you know I've had
that feeling and even now I'm still
batting through that feeling of it's
almost like a feeling of dread of of
next it's like oh my gosh and I I see
that as being fearful or fearful of the
future and fearful of what's going to
happen and feeling like you're out of
control
and that can be a really nigga negative
place to be especially if people stay
there if you like long-term now a lot of
people who I feel that can stay in
negative positions for a very very long
time and it literally burdens them it's
like a weight on their shoulders and
like I feel that it's really I feel that
it's really important to not let
negative things get you down and it just
sounds so easy you know just don't let
it get to you and you'll hear people
saying that oh tap you on the shoulder
and it's really not that easy sometimes
and sometimes you need to work how do I
get out of this position so I'm gonna
give you a few tips that I feel that are
amazing for getting out of that place of
feeling despair and feeling I don't know
down and getting into a place of
positivity and hope and faith that the
things that are to come are for your
good and the situations that you face
now I'm not gonna be like that forever
and you will come out of it and come out
of it in a better way
so number one this is one thing I've
found to be effective for me is been
looking outside of myself
so sometimes we spend a lot of time
wallowing in my problem of this is going
wrong this isn't this isn't right this
isn't working for me
sometimes just step out of it step out
of it and just think to yourself do you
know what I'm not going to think about
me today I'm gonna think about something
I'm not saying you have to think about
the poor or the dying but think about
someone else think about your friend
think about your sister think about your
mom think about your dad think about
somebody besides yourself get out of the
box and the position of wallowing and
what your situation is and that will
help you really put into perspective and
gives you time away from the situation
that you're dealing with and often
helping others is an amazing way to
encourage yourself and this is one of
the reasons why I'm doing this now as I
come out to reach out to you it
encourages me in what I'm going through
I'm not going through anything poison
goes but it encourages me to feel strong
and to trust that the words I say are
true and trust that what I say will come
to be so that's number one number two
find your happy place and I've realized
for me is that sometimes when there's so
much noise so many people just around I
just need to get my own space and you
know when you live in their house and
like a million people it's hard to find
your place and your space so sometimes
just going on a walk going outside and
just collecting your thoughts and a lot
of us don't have enough time to actually
collect our thoughts and put them
together turn off the TV turn off the
YouTube turn off the music turn off the
radio turn off the noise and go to that
place that you can sit down and breathe
and think about your position and where
you want to get to next and not in there
like oh my god worries me think about
think thoughts of like okay this is
where I am and this is where I want to
be and how do I get there so the next
thing is try to I didn't rationalize
like what what is getting to you and why
it's getting to you or what's making you
feel negative
and when you've identified that it could
be certain people around you who are
just absolutely negative and make you
feel bad assert yourself make you feel
bad about your situation make you feel
that you're not good enough and
sometimes you don't realize that that's
all the negativity literally sitting on
your shoulders like a ton of bricks and
you don't need that and you don't want
that in your life and then when you've
identified that you can identify how are
you going to step out of this how are
you gonna work out of this and you have
to decide yourself how you're going to
do that finally I think when you've
identified your problems you don't
identified your issues make a plan and
make your plan in hope and make your
plan in faith and I always like I am
extremely positive person because if I
don't have faith and I don't have hope I
have nothing and I take joy and take
stock in the fact that whatever I'm in
now is not forever whatever I'm in now
is a stepping stone and a platform for
the future so if I'm going through
amazing good things I know that that's
just preparing me for more amazing good
things to come and to realize in that
position to humble myself and to take
stock of where I am now because oh my
gosh even more is come in and if I'm a
position where things are negative or
hard I take stock in the fact that
things will not be negative and hard
forever and if this is it and I can face
this I can face anything and that is
what you will realize when you kind of
identify where you are where you're
gonna be and learn from the situation
that you're in then and do not let it
get you know on top of you you can't you
can't you have to be strong you have to
hold faith if you have to identify your
what your issues are and you have to
just take steps and take joy in fact
than faith that what is going to come is
going to be amazing and listen to trust
me in the fact that I'm saying what will
come for you Nick tomorrow next week
next year the next five years will be
better than whatever go through a
situation that you're in now and when
you hold firm in that
tomorrow that there's opportunity there
for you you will be fine
work it out and then you can just have a
positive outlook and just joy and the
countenance that you know what things
will work out for me
I'm good I'm happy and you guys see me
like that because that is I hold fast
and I'm strong in the faith of what what
what I have now what goes on now isn't
forever and the future is going to be
beautiful and brighter so I hope that
was interval and helpful to some of you
out there you may feel negative and
giving me all right yes Patricia listen
to yokes a girlfriend and go start
talking love you all bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
