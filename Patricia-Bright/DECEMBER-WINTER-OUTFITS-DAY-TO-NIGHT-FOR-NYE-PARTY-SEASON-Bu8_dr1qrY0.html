December is in the air so I wanted to do
kind of like a wintery lookbook although
it's been so mild here it's been
literally amazing not obviously it still
remains gray but my old I'm enjoying and
but I wanted to share some of the looks
that I really like you know during the
winter season but also for the party
season as well and obviously I've got a
bump and my body is changing however I
still want to do me I still want to rock
my style in a way that I feel really
comfortable so hopefully this gives
girls of all shapes and all sizes and
inspiration for kind of like the winter
season I'm going to link everything in
the description bar below as well and I
I do link my products because people
have been asking me about this like why
don't you link stuff and but sometimes I
go and look for the item and it's like
gone or it's sold out I can't find it
happens all the time so as many of the
links I can find are down below and so
many people ask me about my eyelashes
they are from the law I've got a
discount code it's in a description bar
below as well my hair it's Ledger's on
for my own hair extensions line link
down below my hair and I also have a new
draw my life that was done for me on the
drama live channel and that is also
linked in the description box so guys I
hope you enjoyed this video and it gives
you some inspiration for more lookbook
so let me know in the comments let me
know what your favorite look is and give
it a thumbs up as well so my current
favorite daytime look is basically an
oversized top and skinny jeans and I
usually just throw on a leather or
jacket over it and I just like to add a
few little accessories and some booties
I'll break it down
after that I'm in love with an oversized
jumper it's so absolutely comfortable as
well as cozy and I usually like to pair
it with
over-the-knee boots why Chris you have a
sneaky little gap that looks a little
bit sexy but keep it really simple when
it's really cold I love my oversized
faux fur jacket this is from ASOS it
kind of reminds me of cookie Lyon but it
doesn't matter what you're wearing
underneath you really look put together
with something like this on the very top
even if you've got basics on
I
so for the party season I've been loving
getting my legs out it's hard to find
something I feel super comfortable in I
found that cool off work wonderful for
me I like getting the boobies out and
the legs out and I feel extra confident
so usually I love wearing black but I
saw this red jumpsuit and I just thought
it was gorgeous I love the kind of
keyhole detail at the net and these
boots make anyone a legs I look sexy
I'm in love with this outfit and it's
gonna be perfect for when I'm away
so guys I hope you enjoyed that and it
gave some inspiration I hope you have a
lovely new year and hopefully I catch
you before then thanks for watching guys
