a celebrity makeup look which I never do
but I've been loving X Factor you a it's
like I've been watching loads of X
hunting us and I love Demi Lovato
basically and I must be late but
honestly I didn't know who she what was
before X Factor but you know I've been
like reading up on her she's so gorgeous
and I really like her and I like her
song it's all girls I thought I really
wanted to do a Demi Lovato makeup look
and I saw like a picture from her from
the People's Choice Award and she just
looked so glorious and she was wearing
coral and so I thought I put on my coral
dress so that definitely inspired me to
do this a video guy so it's October
transformation month in my opinion so
there are any other celebrity looks of
like me to do then let me know below and
I'll do them and let me know your
thoughts on this cuz actually this is my
first ever I think yeah my first ever
one so be nice
I'll see you guys later and I hope you
enjoy this tutorial bye guy I'm starting
off with the eyebrows I've noticed that
Demi has really strong and quite precise
eyebrows that are quite dark so I'm
using a pencil by L'Oreal which I feel
is a perfect color for me and it's
really really pigmented when I use it
you'll notice that I brush my eyebrows
upwards as I know is she has a really
high arch that really opens up her eyes
so after that I just use a brush to make
it not look so harsh but again
concealing is really necessary to give
me those really defined really high
looking brows
so for the moment I don't bother blend
in too harshly and I'm gonna go ahead
and just use my primer this is by
benefit and it's absolutely amazing if
you want that kind of flawless celebrity
glow so my foundation is my usual which
is actually the match master than an 8.5
apologies I said it wrong a few times
but that's definitely what I'm using and
it might look a little bit light or a
bit orangey now but it's fine it
oxidizes really well so my next thing to
do to get that really celebrity
glamorous look it's basically to conceal
with a concealer which is two shades
lighter than my skin and I do it in kind
of a v-shape under my eye
terms of getting the right eye shadow
color I'm just gonna pry my eyes and
Demi is wearing a kind of burnt orange
coral and luckily for me I've got the
sleek respect palette which has quite a
few of the colors I think I'm really
useful so I'd go ahead and buy the light
orange on my eyelid which is a little
bit difficult to see but I need to
really layer that on and I go from the
dark orange right in my crease area so
for me I don't usually wear color so I
am just gonna add a bit of a darker
Brown to tone it down slightly and add a
bit of smokiness to it which is actually
similar to what demi was wearing in this
look anyway but what do you guys think
of me wearing color on my lids
so next up I'm gonna just highlight
under my brows just to really give me
those really defined eyebrows like daily
so I'd go ahead and start lining my eyes
on the top of the liquid eyeliner and on
the bottom of the pencil so I've done
done some false lashes that you can tell
here and I'm then adding some mascara
and I'm absolutely loving the mascara
from I think it's L'Oreal it's just
amazing it's gonna be my favorite six
months of love it so I'm gonna apply a
blush by sleep and the wonderful thing
about Demi is that she's got a gorgeous
baby face that's really bounce I'm not
even gonna bother with contouring so
next I'm gonna mute out my natural lip
color with the lip liner and this is a
drugstore product which is absolutely
amazing so then I'm using and love the
drugstore lip gloss which just gives me
that glamorous and nobody glow and this
is by L'Oreal again but I'll put
everything in the description box
voila that is me done do you think I
look like a celebrity a little bit like
a me and black person anyway I hope you
enjoyed that video and it was an easy
tutorial so thanks for watching guys
