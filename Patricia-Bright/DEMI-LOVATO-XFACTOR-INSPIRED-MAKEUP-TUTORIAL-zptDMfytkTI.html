sunday hey guys so today's video is
going to be a celebrity makeup look
which I never do but I've been loving X
Factor you a it's like I've been
watching loads of extracting us and I
love Demi Lovato basically and I must be
late but honestly I didn't know who she
was before x factor but you know I've
been like reading up on her she's so
gorgeous no really like her and I like
her song is what girls okay I thought I
really wanted to do a demi lovato makeup
look and I saw like a picture from her
from the People's Choice Award and she
just looked so glorious and she was
wearing coral and i thought i put my
coral dress so that definitely inspired
me to do this video guy so it's october
transformation month in my opinion so
there are any other celebrity looks at
like me to do then let me know below and
I'll do them and let me know your
thoughts on this cuz actually this is my
first ever I think yeah my first ever
one so be nice I'll see you guys later
and I hope you enjoyed this tutorial by
guy so starting off with the eyebrows
I've noticed that Demi has really strong
and quite precise eyebrows are quite
dark so I'm using a pencil by L'Oreal
which I feel is the perfect color for me
and it's really really pigmented when I
use it you'll notice that I brush my
eyebrows upwards as I know is she has a
really high arch that really opens up
her eyes so after that I just use a
brush to make it not look so harsh but
again concealing it's really necessary
to give me those really defined really
high looking brows
so for the moment I don't bother
blending too harshly and I'm going to go
ahead and just use my primer this is by
benefit and it's actually amazing if you
want that kind of flawless celebrity
globe so my foundation is my usual which
is actually the match master than an 8.5
apologies that said it wrong a few times
but that's definitely what I'm using and
it might look a little bit ly to a bit
orangi now but it's fine it oxidizes
really well so my next thing to do to
get that really celebrity glamorous look
it's basically to conceal with a
concealer which is two shades lighter
than my skin and I do it in kind of a
v-shape under my eye
terms of getting the right eye shadow
color I'm just going to prime my eyes
and Demi is wearing a kind of burnt
orange coral and luckily for me I've got
the sleek respect palette which has
quite a few of the colors I think I'm
really useful so I go ahead and apply
the light orange on my eyelid which is a
little bit difficult to see but I need
to really lay that on and then go from
the darker orange right in my crease
area so for me I don't usually wear
color so I am just going to add a bit of
a darker Brown to tone it down slightly
and add a bit of smokiness to it which
is actually similar to what Demi was
wearing in this look anyway but what do
you guys think of me wearing color on my
lids
so next up I'm going to just highlight
under my brows just to really give me
those really defined eyebrows like
they're with so I'd go ahead and start
lining my eyes on the top of the liquid
eyeliner and on the bottom with a pencil
so I dawned on some false lashes if you
can tell here and I'm then adding some
mascara and I'm absolutely loving the
mascara from I think it's lore'l it's
just amazing it's gonna be my favorite
six months of love it so I'm gonna apply
blush by Smith and the wonderful thing
about Demi is that she's got a gorgeous
baby face that's really round I'm not
even going to bother with contouring so
next I'm going to mute out my natural
lip color with the lip liner and this is
a drugstore product which is absolutely
amazing so then i'm using another drug
store lip gloss which just gives me that
glamorous celebrity glow and this is by
l'oreal again but i'll put everything in
the description box voila that is me
done do you think I look like a
celebrity a little bit like gummy the
black version anyway I hope you enjoyed
that video and it was an easy tutorial
