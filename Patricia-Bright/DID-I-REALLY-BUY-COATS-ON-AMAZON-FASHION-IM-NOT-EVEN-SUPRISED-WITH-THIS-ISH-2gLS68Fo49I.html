channel I hope you are doing well I'm
excited as I always am and today we've
done a little bit more exploration
online and we have gone to Amazon to
find what goodies we can find for the
autumn and winter season in the codis
department because you know we need to
keep ourselves warm up top looking fresh
looking comfortable while the ice
you know blazes a school here in the UK
anyway so yeah I wanted to see what
coats I could find on Amazon and I'll be
honest with you I'm a huge Amazon fan I
feel like I actually use Amazon like
every single day but for different
things so if you're looking for a
shoehorn it's on Amazon if you're
looking for a pencil holder it's on
Amazon the sharpen on Amazon memory card
Amazon everything I go to is literally
on Amazon and I feel like it's a really
good site that Amazon Prime means that
people's feet do not really need to
leave their house anymore
how can you do same-day delivery really
come on I love that I love Amazon Prime
I am a prime member but to be honest
with you I'm more of a random
miscellaneous stuff briar on Amazon
versus clothing so I've never bought
clothing on Amazon before says that ok
let me see what I could find in the coat
department look I've got some goodies
under some primary essence up see Next
Day Delivery
I definitely got some goodies in the
coat departments from all over and what
I will say is that one deliveries fast I
really trust
Amazon they do really good shipping and
all that kind of jazz and returns really
really easy and they'll pick up from
your home the clothing I noticed that
they had stuff from Levi's they stuff
from van there's stuff from new look a
cheap Monday they had Finders Keepers
that was actually quite a good range of
brand on the side but I don't think it
was their most up-to-date newest stuff
what I'll say that I didn't feel like it
was a bargain like things weren't like
much much cheaper but I feel like you
could search any style and you'll find
it so if you wanted a leather jala you
could type in leather Jala or for
jillee it would come up I really wanted
a faux fur Julie and I really wanted a
actual of just faux fur jacket found
those online I wanted to puffer jackets
all the kind of stuff that's gonna keep
me warm this winter and you type in the
style listen they all come up you can
find people in the UK you confront
people you know in Asia as well I just
decided to just you know do a little
shot up and do a little investigation to
see if we can find anything that was any
good also I'm gonna give you guys a
quick insight into like my hair my
makeup and my my outfit because my last
video it was like makeup do da Lian
foundation I'm wearing is the Sephora
ten our way if you watched my Sephora
video you'll see that I was wearing this
foundation the last time and I and I've
been wearing it ever since I did that
video it's actually sick my concealer is
the Bobbi Brown instant full coverage
concealer a shade golden I think it's
been out for like two or three months or
maybe it's on July or something it's the
sickest concealer of all time it's just
got that lovely yellowness and it's just
so full coverage it looks fantastic my
lip keys are also the Sephora and
lippies they look really good I love
them
whoo the beauty lashes I think eyebrows
Archie the L'Oreal is in the paradise
collection Brad made love it but a
little senti Beauty highlighter I look
my products in the description below
because you guys always arts these I'll
try and give you a little makeup segment
in each video just so you know but let's
get into this XO guys the first jacket I
have here is this jacket here it is a
denim jacket and it's from Wrangler
which is quite an old-school denim brand
okay yep proper Wrangler jacket it was a
trucker jacket
59 pounds 99 this came next day and for
me I love a good good good denim jacket
so let's try this on and see what it
looks like oh it's really oversized it's
really really really good quality I like
this I think it looks really cool can
wear over my shoulders would be very
Instagram cool isn't that it's a really
nice damage a key I'm not mad at it I
like it but I think it's very easy to
like pick up you know a brand name
Amazon and it'd be what you expect from
the brand I mean if I picked up a Levi
jacket I'm gonna expect it to be Levi's
quality so this is very well I'm feeling
this yeah you know 59 pounds it's pricey
it's the pricey jacket but it's good
quality and I always say I don't mind
paying a little bit more for you know
branded stuff or or stuff that's a
little bit higher quality
I like this there's a little denim
jacket yes okay this isn't my bad is
this mine
wow this is very puffery
it is Jesus didn't like the Sun it's a
lot more red and a lot more shiny than I
think I thought it was but you know the
shapes kind of nice on it and this is
not from a brand so the quality is nice
on this I'm gonna try it on what has he
so short though hold on it I'm just what
do I like this or do I not like this
it's really little bit stuff come on I
love the jacket what do you think of the
jacket mode it's such a cool I feel like
you won't miss me if I walk into the
room though right on top pull my system
oh hey hey so she can see me in my
Crawford puffer jacket it's a little bit
it's a little bit like Missy Elliott I
can't stand the rain do do is I know I
think it still may be it some of you
guys are too young even know that
sunlight I need to find the price of
this to see if I'm happy or not let me
just find me oh I found it oh okay right
it was 22 pounds 99
not bad and I thought like it's warm I
would wear this jacket out I'd be super
duper for I just you know do and get
smile and know I need to come in like
this I'm going to go to music video at
some point in time I felt like I can't
sing but we'll just stop doing music
video anyway against my I know I can't
stand how cute is that I mean it's not
for everyone
but it's just if you want to make a
little statement have a little fun I
like clothing that's fun as well and
homes down go oh okay this is a fur trim
faux fur drape trim oh very nice
so this was 13 pounds 99 faux fur trim I
love things like this on my denim
jackets or leather jacket Zara comes out
with one of these like every year but
they keep going up in price they've gone
up to like 25 pounds now this is $13.99
which i think it's quite nice it's a
bargain and look I'll show you it with
the denim jacket dude that looks like
with like a little denim jacket or a
little leather jacket it just adds that
extra bit of warmth and like expense I'm
rich darling it's from Amazon oh yes
okay so this is a padded winter jacket
this was 32 pounds what is about which
is it bad for a winter jacket it's
really really fat it really padded which
is quite nice the buttons are very gold
and you guys know I don't like gold
hardware when it's like literally
glistening like the Sun really bright
gold but it isn't bad and I feel like
like the year before last my sister
bought and I bought the the Zara of
really really padded jacket and that
ended up costing 99 pounds but I'm not
gonna lie these padded jackets they are
essential in the winter it's so cold so
it's like you know what why not
and I was looking for something almost
like a dupe of the zara winter jacket we
might have it here oh it's a bit short
on the arms though but the fit of this
is lit the way it's to go yeah Reese
matched
I am snatch Maureen hold on I'm gonna
keep them calling Waring in here cuz you
got my go through the got this is in the
size 10 why are they armed so sure how
nice is this jacket worry Maureen that's
the mid-back Antonio right now so we're
not going to show her but how nice is
this jacket
it looks like this up my jacket doesn't
it
it was guess how much it cost he said 25
pounds so I'm worrying really with the
volume oh yeah thumbs up if you guys
want to see a hole with Maureen in it or
don't go shopping with me together we'll
do a shopping chip together with me and
whirring give it a thumbs up if you want
to see that right now she's D wig so
yeah but this check here that's
everything this what then buttons at the
back
oh I don't even see that Morrie's bring
an extra do in here for you hello laughs
and you know it's the way the shape it
goes in and out yeah
do you know what
I live with my arms do you know what the
hood is a little bit depleted it's like
that it's it's the list a little bit
smooshed if you're gonna be a hood
you've got to be a hood like like this
is a bit of a sorry hood I think a
little bit of love a little bit of
nothing and it might be all right she
know us I'm here for this jacket
cuz when it's cold when it's cold what
you need is a puff up you need a puffer
it's cold outside
all these little flimsy outfits they're
not they're not gonna work because
you're cold you shivering you get unwell
and then you're sad oh you're in your
puffer jacket it's like being in a
blanket outdoors just giving me shape
love it Oh what's this the next up is
this faux fur jacket which that's a
beautiful color in do you know what it
is the beautiful colors and say that's a
beautiful camel color on camera but
actually it looks fly as well I love a
faux fur jacket during the winter season
and in store they're usually quite
expensive at this time of year but I do
always get one always ever
season this was 35 pounds 99 oh my lord
do you know what this is some nice but
the short arms are doing the most that
is actually I know it's a trend
sometimes but this is actually
ridiculous honestly the green on this is
beautiful absolutely beautiful look at
that wow it's so nice
ah million dollars just walked into the
room but do you know what I think I
might you gonna wear this tonight
because I really like it going to see
Little Mix tonight yeah
shout out to my ex mess already I'll
just stop hey I love the jacket it's a
really nice faux fur I do have longer
arms than most people but this is this
is this is a bit of a joke because
you're just gonna get a breeze up there
and it's probably going to hit your
kidneys because of the amount of space
that's over here I will let the short
arms slide because they look so good
I felt like I've been able to buy a lot
of winter jackets that I want for this
season just in one shop it was really
easy this is a kind of like a parka
jacket this was 40 powers 50 this is
more like a windbreaker material it's
not very thick it's not gonna keep you
warm but I do like this style of it do
you know the stuff it's really stylish
it doesn't smell I thought I could
before I got a whiff of something but
with final so it's a long line it says
Gallagher style jacket and I love that I
don't know how many of you guys were a
racist fans growing up but obviously
like but Liam got the Gallagher's had
that very unique style this is a very
much no Gallagher style jacket it's thin
a efforts really really thin this is a
jacket that's more for style over
substance which is that why I need I
need to be warm I need to be warm so let
me try this on and see you know what
it's nice it needs it needs an iron
clearly
just come up in the bag it's really long
it diphthongs at the bottom it's got the
drawstring and everything however it is
literally paper paper thing like
literally paper-thin so this is not
going to do anything for me from or to
winter season but if you're looking for
like a light jacket this isn't a bad
option if you like the parka style and
also I don't think it's even waterproof
given the material like imagine if it
started to rain you're wearing this
you'd be soaked through your kid needs
will be freezing and yeah I do quite
like it though so yeah this is
definitely enough for me okay so those
are all the jackets that ordered I did
order a waistcoat which hasn't come in
yet
unfortunately so might just save it for
another video but I'm gonna sit down I'm
gonna share with you my final thoughts
okay so those are the coats that I found
on Amazon and I am very very very very
very very very impressed and it's
actually quite good like how many good
items I was able to find and I felt like
the quality was good but there were a
lot of branded items as I mentioned in
the beginning there were Levi's I was
wrong okra there was cheap Monday's a
lot of branded stuff was there and then
even the stuff that wasn't branded
seemed to be quite good quality so I
wonder if they have like a vetting
process or something before they allow
people to put items on the website like
this is a lot different to like wish and
suddenly out of the website that I've
tried I felt like everything was quite
nice but you know some of the fits
weren't perfect for me which is normal
like when you go shopping not everything
fit we're gonna do a go shopping with me
video series do you guys want to see
that let me know in the comment thumbs
up if you want to see that but overall I
am impressed
yes Amazon like you litter slay my life
by allowing me time same-day delivery or
like memory cards and electronics and
just have every other random item I want
in my life and now you're actually quite
good in the clothing department that
isn't safe and I do love the fact that
you can type in a style like if you were
looking for a certain style of item you
could just type it in
and it would be there and you just have
to be like click click click and it was
alright but you know every single story
is different so you do need to check the
reviews on the store and what people say
about them before you purchase so you
don't end up with bum items because I
did see some reviews that people liked
this is a lot smaller the extra small or
the medium was more like an extra small
yeah the other yeah so do read people's
interviews but I'm gonna say now like
Amazon you're you're you're wonderful
every time a fad okay guys so that is
the end of today's video if there's
anything else you guys want me to see
websites you want me to review please do
let me know in the meantime make sure
you'll follow me on my Instagram because
that's where you'll see me wearing a lot
of items and on my Twitter so I can talk
to you guys and also my snapchat so you
can just see me like debate and casual
other than everyday ok guys thank you
for watching and I'll see you later bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
