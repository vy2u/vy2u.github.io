hate booties don't leave us to ruffle
okay hello hello beautiful people
welcome back to my channel
happy Thursday how are you doing not
right you can actually respond but I
just wanted to ask anyway today I'm very
excited which is most of the time but I
wanted to do a video reviewing eBay a
lot of you guys live comments for me to
check out eBay and Amazon and Aliexpress
and all these different kind of websites
and I get I'm getting through it but I
was like you know what I'm gonna try a
BAE right about now I wasn't willing to
go into the clothing straightaway but
there were some goodies that I actually
wanted personally and I was like right
let me see if I can find these items on
eBay so I was actually specifically
looking for a pair of cream Newsies is
the 350 and I actually went into like I
think it's called CREP something store
in like near Oxford Circus and I went
into the store and saw the creamy Z's
and I saw them for 750 pounds I was like
we're really selling that for 750 pounds
really I'm funny enough when I went into
store the guy said to me listen you can
probably get them online for slightly
cheaper or actually hundreds cheaper
however what you don't have is the
confidence of you know them being a
guaranteed seller or they've been
getting your item or being scammed and I
thought okay you are setting me up for a
challenge
challenge accepted I decided to buy some
goodies on the eBay again as I said I'm
specifically looking for Yeezys but that
is literally a treasure trove of shoes
we got we got a lot of shoes oh okay we
just we've just got some shoes we've got
some shoes on eBay and I bought
basically hopefully ruies ease I bought
some dupes of some other stuff and I'm
just gonna see are they any good
is it worth our coin ladies and
gentlemen
and I'll be honest with you it took
quite a while for some of the items to
come obviously they're all different
sellers some of the sellers were rude
those are seller who was so rude I was
just like you have to be kidding me
so you know when it came to purchasing
the item I mean prices varied so
obviously for Yeezys the price was 489
pounds but in store I saw them for 750
pounds and I thought that was a good
price if they are actually you know
genuine and kosher and then other shoes
are like 19 pounds or 30 pounds there
are a lot of shoes that are copies so a
lot of shoes that are copies they are
fakes and they say that these are not
originals these are copy and then or
they are dupes of a certain style anyway
I feel like I've talked enough I think
it's time to get in to this video okay
so this is pad number one I haven't
opened these at all oh I don't know if
they do refund you know I hope they do
because if somebody shoes or depth
listen I don't want them hence the song
these oh my gosh
hold on what size are these these are
size 42 my feet are big but they're not
that big cheese hold on that is a size
UK 9 I am NOT a size UK 9 ever size UK 8
I came size 41 why they sent me and not
these I literally look like a beak that
actually ridiculous these were 11 pounds
87 that's a very odd price okay let's
try it on and see what these look like
on I mean besides that the construction
seems really nice the red is a really
really nice color you can kind of see
the glue around here and I mean
obviously these are shoes that cost 11
pounds I'm not expecting the world but
overall they look they look okay they
look okay also like the inside is just
looking a little bit just a little bit
dodge anyway let's see what these look
like on these are on they look a bit
weird it looks like there's something
wrong with the with the suede it looks a
bit patchy they're far too long
obviously because the size isn't my size
and that the front is just too too thick
it's just
thick and to peaky these are just giving
me duck face vibe the front of them are
so beat it's actually insane I mean I
don't hate that but I'm not about having
that beak foot okay so these are the
next pair of shoes these are from the
same seller as well
these were 12 pounds 34 I don't know why
the pricing is so specific who knows uh
I think these have come from China
because there's like I mean I shouldn't
say Chinese it might not be China but
there is some oriental style writing on
here that I can't read but it got here
quite quickly so where this got here in
like six days that is really good it's
cottage there were little cottage
beauties but eh but they're alright I
don't think they're bad I've been there
cute we're into it oh I like these
and you can't see any glue these are the
size 41 that are my actual size 41 yes
hmm
like there's no glue hanging or anything
like that they seem a little bit
sturdier and they seem quite nicely 2012
99 okay hey this is this pad I'm going
to show you not too much time because my
toes are not pretty but these are cute
though I know my toes are coming over
the edge slightly they're bit small if I
push my foot okay if I push my foot all
the way to the back then they do go in a
lot better I think these are key I've
been they're super cute I love the way
these look and actually the funny thing
is I haven't seen any shoes like this
anywhere so I love that you know if
you've got an eBay you can find a unique
pair of shoes versus she's a copy of
something else
I actually genuine you haven't seen any
shoes like this so I'm feeling the
okay so these shoes here I know why I
bought them these are due of the
Balenciaga Roadrunners I have the actual
Balenciaga Roadrunners here these are my
black ones and I wanted to see if these
are actually any good in regards to how
they look they look very very similar in
tons of style however these are
literally made of crepe paper they're
really really nice they're like no made
of styrofoam the bottom is currently
styrofoam it's like AF they're not bad
though they are quite a good knockoff to
be honest they never tried to say these
are Balenciaga I just saw this file I
knew that was a knockoff of the
Balenciaga I mean there was 1699 they're
a nice look and they're an alternative
let's see what these look like on okay
go race runners I'm excited for these I
feel like they're all right
okay let's do it it looked okay on
donate they do very much look like the
race runners if there was this colorway
but they actually looked quite nice on
there a nice comfortable pair of
trainers not gonna lie the bottom mark
are quite slippery I can imagine that
have you wore these in the rain you
would sleep have you ever had a pair of
shoes like that there every time you
walk in you're literally like balancing
and holding on for dear life like you
might just lose your life in one move
cuz these are not they're not a good
grip on the bottom at all but terms of
the style I've been there alright
aha okay okay I have a feeling that
these are the easies now I'm slightly
confused because the box that these have
come in right now this is not the Yeezy
boost box this is an adidas box that has
been ripped apart but maybe this is the
person who made an order a big order on
a DDoS and they came in and added s box
I don't know if I'm just trying to do
all kinds of calculations in my head
right now let's just go in
okay easy boost 350 okay hello I mean
it's all looking quite legit right now
oh hey okay so these are the Yeezy boost
350s that I bought on eBay
these are definitely kosher because
obviously I have I looked in store I've
tried them on I knew which size I wanted
and here we go these are a fish wow
these are really nice as well I love
these these are the ones I've really
wanted I saw some lady wearing them and
they look really cute on her and I was
like you know what I need to get these
are they look fabulous they look how I
thought they would look I have tried
these on in store before and I get these
in a size seven and a half because achi
the eight was really big on me and these
do give I really like these I've been
running a pair of these for ever and
then legit cute literally why one I
wanted white trainers for casual running
around town and just looking cute I feel
quite comfortable enough that they are
official easy boots they've got the
boost on the bottom as well I don't know
what shoes it in oh I think I know
what's in here I bought some some over
the knee boots
this is says shoe geek and everything on
the front that smizes I'd like to see
official package in my face they smell
hey did she smell like burning foam
they're not bad though they're actually
kind of a cute oh is it over the knee
boot size 41 I mean yeah you can
definitely see quite a bit of glue on
this but the over the meanest is quite
nice I like the way that this is kind of
saggy and everything
the stitching looks okay obviously it is
a faux suede that isn't a real suede
clearly they literally smell like France
flames what is this I feel like also it
smells like chemicals that you could get
high but let's let me show you the
detailing clothes these cost 16 pounds
that's super cheap for so much fabric
I don't believe how much you know cheap
these are Tiffany's they do look like
cheap shoes let's try them on
even these boots on they match is super
cute I like them I like the fact that
they've got all of this kind of ruching
down them that actually really soft
leather they actually feel quite nice on
I actually like them they like really
really ride there up to the knee and
they are a bit big but I look quite
skinny legs anyway and then but there's
this drawstring to kind of tie them up
to make them stay all the way up like
where you might want them to stay which
is really quite nice I think they're
really cute
they're quite thin so I feel like I can
feel the hill there's no cushioning
inside the shoe literally no cushion
whatsoever they look nice no hey hello
what'd you guys think do you like them
would you okay these are the final pass
I think those are quite a few pairs in
here Oh always broken nails okay let's
go in these are a dupe of the
Valentino's but this is like you know
really high shoe version of it they
actually quite cute you know I'm not
gonna lie they're actually quite nice
and they were actually really good
quality obviously they're made of
plastic and these are shiny but these
are you know a way more affordable
option because these bad boys cost 21
pounds and they don't like that that
they were made they look well-made they
look very very nice they're not bad
they're not bad at all I'll show you all
three Wow Wow do you know what I was
gonna say don't like them but I do like
them I don't like the studying big it's
unnecessary for there to be studs I
don't know why oh yeah they have stubs
in the picture these are nine pounds
these are so pretty compared summer
shoes too bonus of you I actually have
this Chanel espadrilles clearly I love
my shoes but and I love espadrilles for
summer but these are actually pretty and
at least they're not they're not
actually copying anyone it's just an
espadrille oh my gosh how is the
glittery the good look at the glue and
the
looks like babysit look at that that
glue looks like actual baby sick if I
struggle so basically a lot of people
ask me about my Pumas these are the
Fanta Pumas these are from a couple of
collections ago I really like these that
people ask me about these a lot but
obviously because they're quite hard to
find at the moment I think and they may
be a little bit more pricey I was
looking for an alternative but I'm
telling you these are not an alternative
these are the struggle just don't don't
just don't do it just don't do it and
sometimes it's alright
sometimes it is worthwhile spending
money on the things that you want
because then you think you think you're
get you finger playing this and what you
get is this yeah look at this look at
this with the babysit glue what is that
I am different I am annoyed I'm
literally annoyed what is that and the
person was confident enough to pack this
in a box and send this to a customer
the glue is like it's all fully out this
is more glue this is the glue and I tell
you now it will take one we're in one
British reign for this as we like
disappear off okay so this is this pair
on and they are genuinely quite cute
although these are a mission to put on
they are quite cute the only thing I'll
say these are besides a but I do feel
like I've got half of my foot okay
that's a slight exaggeration but there's
a lot of foot coming up the back these
arches slightly nicer than way up to 110
hoods because I think the Keen is a
little bit higher I like them I actually
genuinely like them and for 21 pounds
these you know you can't go wrong with
these cute teddy these are the
espadrilles with some really small shoe
sizes I don't know what's going on but
they've really - I've got narrow feet so
why you can see if I like literal the
corner of my foot there I think that the
shoes are a little bit just on the
smaller size then of the worst
espadrilles I wear this you know want to
summer on it eh or something quite cute
my thoughts on these they're so fail I'm
just annoyed these are not a size 41
my toe is really
breaking inside my Tony's lychee like a
hook my toes it's like this on the
inside just the proper look they look
like clown shoes they're too small the
bow is lopsided and I'm offended so
we're just gonna these ever no these are
actually a note I think eyes that is me
done with my ebay shoe review what do
you guys think I am surprising with some
of the goodies that I've got I'm also
not surprised by the fact that some of
it just seemed a little bit smaller than
normal obviously I've got some Easy's
which were nice and they'll more
affordable than going into one of these
crepes doors or the stores that sew them
at a really really high premium there
are some shoes that they just gave me
kind of cheap market feel and to be
honest you know it's eBay you kind of
are taking a little bit of a risk and
you kind of do get what you pay for
which is in life in general if you're
trying to get bargains at you know
twelve pounds that's fine but you're
kind X necessarily expect like designer
and quality so yeah that is it I hope
you guys enjoyed in the meantime I will
catch you guys on Sunday I'm gonna try
and have something special for you guys
but yeah I will see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
