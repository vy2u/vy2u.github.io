about now today I'm going it with a DIY
which I never ever ever do I wanted to
do a kind of Christmas Java pal
some might say ugly Christmas general or
Christmas outfit video but yeah I did it
with me why couldn't grace my coming and
he's like entertaining grace behind the
camera cause they have it he's kind of
ill so I said give him a thumbs up for
kind of modeling for me in the ugly
Joker that I made him and I made this
skirt and the gentleman I'm currently
wearing is so easy and cool to do I
wanted to do something that was kind of
fun and Christmassy for the DIY season
if you guys haven't seen boys every year
for a while she said what's up what's up
everyone what she's saying or something
you guys and Michael's doing all kinds
of Magnus behind the camera right now if
actually hilarious but as I'm doing
right Merce and if you're not subscribed
but she's subscribe it is quick anything
to do and giving away laptop iPhone and
lots of little goodies for you guys as
well so make sure you give this video a
thumbs up let's try and get it to 10,000
lights do go say bye darling bye so
going straight into it I'm going to show
you how I made this gorgeous skirt for
little Gracie so quick and easy to do so
all I had was a roll of tulle which I
bought from Amazon some puffs also from
Amazon and a oversize headband I could
use on her waist
now the row I have is basically six
inches by 10 meters and what I did is I
cut long strips and folded these in half
to basically create the length of skirt
that I knew I wanted to grace and I did
this like 10 million times because I had
loads and loads of strips because I
wanted the skirt to be nice and puffy
now this was the longest part of the
whole making of the skirt
so once I had done that basically with
the headband I use this as a waistband
so if you can find yourself something
stretchy and then what you need to do is
get your tool fold it in half and kind
of squeeze it create a loop and tie that
around your waistband and it's one of
those really simple loops that you know
they don't take too much time and
they're not that tight and you can
adjust accordingly
I ended up doing is quite a few times to
create the perfect full skirt now with a
hot glue gun I basically got the puffs
that I bought online to basically just
cover the band on the outside and to
make it a little bit more Christmassy
so as easy as that I was able to make
this gorgeous skirt which consumed a
little one or an adult if you wanted
something dramatic right so I'm going to
go ahead and show you guys how I made my
little lazy light art pom-pom Christmas
jumper I basically bought a roll of
pom-poms which are really cheap and easy
to buy and I got this off the shoulder
jumper that I personally really liked
myself sometimes I find jumpers I just
don't think that they suit me and yes
the trusty hot glue gun came into play
and basically this is already on a roll
of ready-made pom-poms and I just lead
it along the scene now I could have even
run it on the inside and then flap them
over if I wanted to but you know it
wasn't too expensive a jumper and I
really like the style of it I thought it
was really cute I did it around the
neckline and around the arms with the
hot glue gun and so far all has stopped
in place but because it's clear I can
just take this off and it looks
absolutely fine now for the added light
up I basically bought these LED lights
which you could wear in clothing or
anything and I just wrapped it around
and under all of the pom-poms
and what I ended up with was a really
nice kind of stylish um Christmas jumper
that also lights up so for model Michael
I knew that I wanted to be a tasty and
nicely wrapped up present for me this
was so quick and easy to do and it
doesn't involve ruining clothing you
actually like while I use as pins and
label some ribbon and a Primark jumper
because he don't all have money to spend
on wasting good clothing so I basically
did a cross-section using ribbon and I
used the safety pin on the other side of
the jumper to make sure that the ribbons
were in place I did this on all corners
just to secure them after that I pulled
up the trusty hot glue gun just to
secure the center and then I created
myself a bow using the ribbon that I
have and I've never made one of these
before but it was so easy I just folded
folded and glued and then I attached a
Merry Christmas tag for the little candy
canes on the side I glue them together
use a safety pin for the ribbon and I
basically tied them to the very top and
that was it and of course when you try
to take the family photos something has
to go wrong
I don't think Christmas would work if
you didn't have a batter when it came to
taking a photo so unfortunately it's one
didn't happen because Michael had to
permanently sneeze so instead I'm gonna
leave you with a sandwich shot that Oki
of grace
and I'm aji cries of laughter but I'm
editing it so guys I hope you enjoyed
thank you so much for watching and I
will see you soon remember to give this
video a thumbs up make sure you
subscribe to this channel and there'll
be more videos for brightness so see you
guys later
guys welcome to my channel and happy
brightness I am feeling like a chocolaty
glow in a Christmassy Barbie right about
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
