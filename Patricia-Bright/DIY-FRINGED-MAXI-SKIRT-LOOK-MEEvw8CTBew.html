I'm gonna show you how I make a tassel
skirt all you need is a long fitted or
long blue skirt if you want depending on
the maxi school you're going to need is
either some chalk or some eyeshadow
silver eyeshadow which is what I use and
just an applicator so I'll quickly show
you how right you want to do is to wear
your skirt and draw turn it inside out
and then draw a line which I have done
here now it's really hard doing it
yourself as you can see the Batman
really awful but you're gonna have to do
something so you draw the line across
just so you don't go up to her high on
your skirt and you also need a pair of
fabric scissors as well to cut through
and all I'm going to do is just by I
draw some lines straight up and if you
have a flat surface this should be
fairly easy and you don't have to beat
you know - too smart or too nearby and
I'm going to start from the middle and
just cut alright as straight as I can
now cutting fabric is more of an art
rather than a science
I don't want me if you know the lines
are a big jaggedy or anything because
let me do the final step at the end it
kind of works out so I'm gonna do them
about an inch thick cuz I really don't
want to sit here for hours doing this
one thing I actually forgot to do was to
cut off the the hemming at the bottom
you don't need that it's gonna make your
tassel bits look strange so you can do
that at the very beginning or do on each
individual piece so I've now completed
one side pin and you can see that it's a
bit raggedy in everything from don't
worry if it looks a bit baggy too
because all you have to do is start to
pull you could pull them individually or
you can pull them all together but this
causes the fabric to curl and it makes
it look nice
so that is now finished and I've pulled
them I pulled them individually to make
it look a lot nicer and that's what you
end up having if there are a few jaggedy
bits you know you can just kind of cut
them off so I couldn't show you how I
might stop</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
