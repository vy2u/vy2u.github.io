channel today i feel like i'm coming to
you looking particularly ashy because
i've got my sunscreen on and my primer
on and nothing else on top and i feel
like those two mixed together are
literally a recipe for the queen of the
ash but it's all good summer is here is
getting so hot they're crazy and i
wanted to test out this makeup tips that
i have been seeing her like maybe ghost
makeup artist talked about it's worth I
think Jackie I know Jerry I think easy
home to it I've seen destiny machinery I
like this idea of putting on powder
before foundations are some people that
sounds absolutely crazy that why would
you do that
but supposedly for those of us who are
more prone to we need and are we will
seep through or both of us were prone
you know especially when it's tough to
just looking like a shiny disco ball
this is like the savior the savior of it
all so I'm going to go ahead and attempt
to do that right now we'll come on and
tell you guys what I think and then I'm
going to do my day today I've got quite
a busy day I'm out and about and I'll
come back in the evening and tell you
what I look like to be honest anything
you solid as a rock it needs to be
looking like concrete but I gorgeous
concrete not like awful concrete so
firstly I'm going to go in with my power
lines and use my next powder this is the
minimize set it goes right here is a
really affordable power you can find it
anywhere and then I'm using my Mac clay
skin clarifying foundation this is from
the body shop
I actually partnered with them get some
videos on their channel use this
foundation and really really really
liked it it's a mattifying foundation
and currently I'm actually a bit darker
because I've been seeing the Sun like
yeah like getting a young pan and my
face get a lot off really quickly it's
all good I still have my sunscreen so
I'm going to use the darkening shades
adjusting drops also from the body shop
as well these you can put in any
foundation to make it calm it's love it
for me it does seem
we're two on powder beforehand I don't
know why they're doing it or how some of
them is now so I'm using this powder for
next it's in the color knife and I'm
just going to dab it on so it's very
weird to just apply powder beforehand
but I feel kind of feel kind of nice
kind of like a treatment I really hope
this isn't too ashy for my skin but when
I've seen it some of the girls they put
on a light powder like this and then
when they put their noir foundation on
top it kind of blends perfectly so I
shouldn't be looking like a ghost
for too long for me my nose is the area
that it's just so shiny and here and
under my eyes like wow imagine if this
is a makeup trend that people ask you or
hashtag bleaching gone wrong hashtag
love myself actually the ash eNOS is
kind of disappearing and I can feel my
oil just being sucked up right now right
okay well that is my layer of parallel
so this was very very dry but I'm hoping
that my foundation is going to make it
feel a little bit better but the whole
point is I don't want to be shiny so yes
you're going to feel kind of dry right
now right so I'm going to go in with the
maknae skinny clarifying foundation from
the body shop the color I'm using is
this tentacle war not zero Semin they've
got a really good range of colors this
is really really nice and this one I
would normally use just on its clothes
but I understand it going with the shade
enhanced adopts because they make a huge
difference to the foundation but just
unlike the drop to just make it darker
it's not mix the two of these now my
Beauty Blender is wet so we're just
going to go in if you like the wet
Beauty Blender by sucking up the water
out of the powder but it's literally
applying as it normally would but I feel
like it's got a little bit more stick
than normal
this is literally crying like it
normally would however I feel like I can
see that it's just drying down now that
the water's coming out it's drying a bit
much up mmm
I've seen in that finish that's kind of
nice kind of money oh okay okay and on
the seat now that'sthat's right a bit
look at that I'm just doing a little bit
more like cheering around I was going to
be back why the hell would anyone do
this does this actually work but
honestly it's a looking kind of flawless
like more for us than normal
I'm telling you that is flawless it's
actually sawdust like yes so I'm ready
for you how's that a little bit worried
expert oh my god that looks flawless hmm
that looks beautiful now it does help
that the foundation is amazing and has a
matte finish like just up close can see
that it does look very matte because a
lot of times after I apply foundation it
can look quite shiny until I powder it
down but I feel like this one needed
pounded down so I'm going to go with my
la girl Pro concealer I'm just going to
highlight under my
I'm wondering if this is going to stop
me from having passed the base so like
no baking necessary that she just supply
my powder and go about my life this is
definitely looking less lonely than it
normally would our believer and actually
believe well it works really well that
looks beautiful
if I do say so myself I'm surprised I'm
really really surprised how everything
went on I thought it would go and I kind
of patchy it doesn't go on patchy and
then it's right you know just give it
give it a minute just a little bit of
patience and then just it comes through
looking stunning right so my foundation
of base they look flawless like honestly
flawless under my eyes looks a lot less
shiny than it normally would a lot less
however I will just add a splash or
powder to base but nothing intense to
contour I'm going to use the body shop
contour palette as well they even have
really nice contour palette really nice
dark shades as well and honestly I feel
like I don't even need to set this like
honestly but my face 100% does not need
to aim in terms of more powder under my
eyes just the touch get some light in
here though I'm actually feeling a
little bit flat now I'm going to use
this pinky color like the blush I feel
like it's going to see it any more in
the highlight okay come to room hi oh
that's pretty
I'm going to go with my favorite L'Oreal
lip paint this color is called red lips
it's like my favorite like nudey nude
I'm actually in the middle is stripped
brown on the outside
I'm deliberating if I even need to
powder onto my eyes deliberating heavily
because I feel like I've got that it's
really nice like flawless p.m. and then
natural jus under my eyes I quite like
the look hot and normally I baked quite
intensely but I'm not going to
definitely definitely not going to do
that I will do a super light wash right
literatures this that is all it needs
nowhere else though because honestly
that would be probably too drying so
like I need a brush
the anistar via blush duo Oh pure old
alright so that is my finished look
honestly I love it I think it really
worked
I mean it looks very different to my
normal application in terms of the matte
finish obviously I use the Maxie
Foundation which does have a matte
finish but this just seems a little bit
more messy and forgot about me you are
listen I can't get enough of matte but I
don't want to be dry and ashy and I'm
already quite dry and so this finish to
me is really pretty I think it looks
really nice really natural now we just
want to see if the date is going to go
well with this look but overall I'm a
huge fan
I think this technique definitely work
so I'll see you soon
eventually ok so this is the reality at
the end of the day I am back I am tired
I narada's match you know all it is
basically let's see what time to leave
it's almost 11:00 and unless you're
wearing makeup for almost 12 hours right
now I'm ready to go to bed this is what
the dressing room is on I'm tired
however I will tell you about it was the
hottest day of the year today it was so
hard it was my like 32 degree centigrade
which is you know hot for us in England
I have been on the train I've been for
lunch I've been for dinner I've been on
a rooftop I've been on a bus I thought
today was one of those days when I've
done it all and only my favorite just
melted into a pile of just pile would
have just been a melt on the floor
however this is a lot less oily than I
would normally be and obviously
something needs to be done about the
lips because they're just looking crusty
but that was my pizza
I gotta go just need to wear something
on and actually it could look maybe
going to make a night out so I am
thoroughly impressed with this whole
concept putting on powder before
foundation there for hot weather special
occasion I would do it and I think
tomorrow definitely going to be doing
this anyway I'm a huge fan and I'm
surprised at how well it actually works
for me this is a 7 to a 10 in 2
the technique so if you're thinking
about trying it it isn't a gimmick and
it works really well so if you do try it
let me know hit me up we like Patricia
made me try it like timing on Instagram
and I was completely utterly appreciate
that so yeah in the meantime I will see
you ready later if you are not
subscribed please do subscribe we'll be
doing more good stuff like this crash
and beauty master wrong we've got a bit
of everything over here but yeah I'll
catch you guys later
