my life you go to the heart for it and
apologies as I cannot draw but I thought
I'd share anyway so the story starts off
with my mum and dad who both met in the
UK at cover Junction actually but they
both originally from Nigeria and Evo but
met here and one year later I was born
we were very happy even though my head
was massive as you can see here and then
my system warming was born so this is my
dad here and you can see he's got a
gorgeous - I love his Tash and I was a
massive daddy's girl growing up and I
thought he was a smartest man in the
world because he was very academic and
published books and even published a
book for us sadly one day the mean
policeman came to my house forcibly
knocked over my mom pushed the kiddies
out of the way to come and take my
father away and we wondered what he'd
done he'd done nothing at all but he had
actually overstayed his visa obviously
he had come here as a student and
started alive and was still studying but
working and the two kids leaving my mum
myself and my sister here my mum did not
work and we did not see him for over
five years it was a very sad day so as
my mum didn't work we didn't have much
money well we didn't have any money so
we ended up moving into some council
flats and you know those high-rise
skyscraper box-room flats oh yeah we
were all living there great times
so women being nifty creatures my mum
obviously got a job as a cleaner and you
can see she is very jolly as a cleaner
but she couldn't leave us at home alone
so she used to bring us with her and
she'd start work about 5:00 a.m. we
would go with her with our sponges and
buckets and go and clean offices and
then we would go to school after that
so despite what was going on at home and
everything and the lack of sleep we
absolutely loved primary school I think
we went to the best primary school ever
people were so loving kind we were like
family and me and my sister always had
each other as a support system so not
much could get us down and we were very
happy slash delusional I would say so
you had quite wild imaginations and we
always wanted to be mermaids or
princesses but we always had our hair in
braids so we used to wear tights on our
head and skirts on our head and pretend
it was hair I might brush it and talk to
ourselves and swimming between duvet
covers and pretend it was the ocean it
was very odd but you know these are the
highlights when you didn't have Barbies
and I was definitely always the princess
so a few years later things started to
look up at home my mom was able to buy
her first council house by basically
working her butt off and we fought every
case we could for five years in court
and we were able to get my dad back to
the UK permanently and we were able to
be a proper family again which was so
wonderful so when I think of secondary
school the word that comes to mind is
Amer I really didn't know where I fitted
in I never really felt part of any group
really I was definitely a floater and
after a while got sick of one group and
moved to another group but one thing I
always was was funny and I always talked
as very loud and I was quite annoying
sometimes but I made people laugh the
teachers are tongue tshis but secretly
they love me I remembered reading
parents evening because I knew the
teachers were going to say I'm too loud
I talk too much and my mum was one of
those women who just did not care
she will shout at you and she gave me
one of the biggest slaps during parents
evening ever and she just told me to
shut her up as she just did not care and
I actually quite applaud her for that
that kind of confidence
and I really fixed my game up even
though the teacher was secretly laughing
I remember there being a turning point
for me when I was at secondary school
and it was when I made the decision to
not care anymore I decided I didn't care
what anybody thought about me I didn't
care if people thought I was gay key or
weird or odd I just did not care I
decided to work really hard and I got
moved up in all my subjects to hire
glass classes I also became a prefect
and that was after the whole prefect
round but I literally went to the head
teachers office every single day picked
up all the registers in the morning and
distributed them out to all the other
teachers for the year and that was just
cuz I wanted to get in the good books
but I was willing to work hard to just
stand out and I didn't want the
reputation of being bad or difficult or
destructive and I just stepped my game
up and it was really worth it and I
don't know how I got there but I'm glad
I did so closer to my final years at
secondary school I got bullied slightly
by the girls in the year above who just
didn't like me very much and obviously
you know they would bully me into me to
fight me off the school and once they
leave school I'd get beaten up and I
remember being quite mouthy and saying I
don't care you can't do anything to me
now I was definitely pretending I would
look very very scared but you know I
never wanted people to know I was weak
they had also threatened me on a
particular day and time that they were
going to get me I remember one of my
lovely friends Lima lending me her hijab
and I actually wore a hijab all the way
home so that they wouldn't recognize me
oh yeah guys that trickery I can't say
much else about College other than the
fact that I absolutely loved it I made
my best friends till this very day and I
actually went to sixth form but it's the
same as college but um like I found my
style there we were so comfortable happy
and free it was a beautiful beautiful
environment and these are just some of
my best friends till now and things are
getting even better at home
our stories definitely rags to riches my
mum and dad you know invested in
properties and we were able to buy
ourselves a beautiful detached house in
a gorgeous area with a massive garden
and you know I had to show off and I had
a house party in the nice area and it
got quite messy and I remember getting
in a lot of trouble but it was worth it
I've got my party story somewhere on my
vids and I did date one guy while I was
in college and I was quite smitten by
him it did affect my grade slightly but
that didn't last for very long as he
wasn't an Isis individual and yeah
that's it really so after college was
University and to be honest I didn't
know what I wanted to do so I ended up
doing fashion marketing because I liked
clothes big mistake because I absolutely
hated the course and I literally knew
nobody and would go in and not speak to
anyone but my social life was absolutely
great I was part of a society and I
partied a lot and had the most amount of
fun I had lots of friends and life was
great outside of uni I ended up changing
my course and I went on to do accounting
and finance so as I said I spent a lot
of time partying and Manchester's a
small place so you kind of end up going
to some of the same places and seeing
the same faces and I remember seeing
this guy with a skinhead and a muscly
body he was a bouncer and he would
always be at the Cubs that I'm I was at
I were working with friends and it was a
small group so I knew some of his
friends and I won my all groups kind of
collided and he ended up fireman lifting
me over his shoulder and stealing me at
this point we've never spoken before he
took my phone and he said if you want it
back you need to give me your number and
way that worked and we ended up dating
around that time I got my first flat and
it should have been a happy time but I
remember feeling very very lonely
know what it's like things change and a
lot of friends kind of left me and went
their own way and I didn't have many
friends at this point in time however I
always had my call by my side to
entertain me and he really helped me
keep my chin up and I also started doing
YouTube around here and it was so
entertaining that who needed friends
when he had the Internet
anyway uni was over and I graduated with
a 2:1 sadly I actually missed my
graduation because I began interning so
after uni I had to leave Manchester and
come down to London and it was a really
confusing time for me and Michael then
because we didn't know what we wanted to
do and we hadn't decided to be
long-distance so virtually broke up for
a period of time I kind of got caught up
in my internship which was at the bull
merrill lynch if you don't know what the
bull is it's a really horrible looking
bull right now but it was a great
experience the world was our oysters we
had money Network and we thought we were
amazing and it was an amazing experience
I made some great friends while I was
there and I got the offer at the end of
the day at this point in time I got
really tired of the lifestyle was living
I had the money I had the job but I was
missing God and I got baptized and I was
ready to just live a life that was
dedicated to more than myself and I felt
such a peace and Michael actually ended
up moving to London and a couple of
years later he finally proposed to me I
was a very happy woman and we had a
beautiful wedding with lots of guests we
could share a wonderful day with our
friends and family and we were so happy
we've also traveled as much as we could
over the past year from Mauritius to
Spain to Thailand and these are all the
other places we're dreaming of going to
very soon all across the world and most
recently we just bought our first home
together and must say it was blood sweat
and tears but it's absolute
be worth it and obviously through this
whole time I've worked one job lost it
had a new job and I'm currently starting
a new role but what has been consistent
is YouTube for the past three years and
the key part of that is you guys you
guys have been a wonderful support and
you don't know how you've encouraged me
in so many ways I'm so grateful I've
been able to share with you and that you
guys have actually helped me more than
you could ever know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
