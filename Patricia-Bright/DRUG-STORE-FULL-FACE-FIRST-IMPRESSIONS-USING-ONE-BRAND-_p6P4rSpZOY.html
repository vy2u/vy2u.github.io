of highlighter it's bubblegum hello
hey guys are welcome thousand times let
me just take it back to life I'd meet
you hey guys welcome to my channel
today's video is a drug store that I
think we need to do a video like this
for quite a while and I basically
whisper our version of the drug store I
went to a booth Bailey Bruce is like and
I like it's like Walgreens was it coming
like CVL I'm not from the US for all my
u.s. people tell me what boots is like
if you've been to the UK but yeah I went
to the drug store and I basically doing
a one brand thing I didn't make it eat
success I didn't make it easy for myself
this time I decided that the first one
as good as deuces was a restaurant for
13 we are like pretending to care and I
can cut six down as it goes through it I
just need to start
how's it going that every find easy you
know what so hard so coming together to
me that might give up for head low and
Reverend isn't known for life it's a
huge color range or anything like that
but I wanted to go in and have a look if
you watch it here you will see like a
little some moments where I was like oh
gosh like fully gasping and I thought my
my son's like oh this is really really
good but this is the overall look so
might be a shiaa than I would normally
go for I don't know what do you guys
think like it is working for me is it
not working for me that is basically it
so guys thanks for watching and
absolutely straight into the video okay
I'm going in with the Revlon brow
fantasy one end is a pencil one end is
the brow gel my only concern is that it
looks like it is really little bit gray
and I saw sometimes pencils like you're
actually pulling out eyebrows at the
same time right I feel that that's the
most I'm going to get with the ohm
pencil and I'm just going to go in now
with the gel she's kind of thinning it
out nicely and then that's a little bit
more sleek in these bad boys down the
kind of is good I really like the color
but I feel like I went excessive hundred
gel but in it feel like I was getting
kind of pale so I'm sorry I'm going to
put my baby with my tongue hold on I
look really hard for concealer that I
could use and I found a color called a
medium deep and this was the darkest
color that I could find on the stand
that I went into and I looked at this
color and I was like listen this is just
looking like one Becky over here like it
seriously it's just it's just not this
just not got a work of me I really hope
they have maybe like two shades darker
concealer but I don't know if they do
but the foundation this is the airbrush
effect foundation and this color is 11
and school cappuccinos I'm just going to
give
my brows and under my eyes with my
normal foundation which is from
bareMinerals you know what's funny now
that I've let that eyebrow at all they
look really nice they kind of look
glossies oh liking that okay I'm going
to go in with the airbrush a Fed
foundation this is the darkest color oil
free fragrance free edge get 20 broad
spectrum way way way way way too like oh
it's a simple my concealer people yeses
I think it might be settling in let's
let's just roll that let's just get it
all in and let's see I'm not going to
lie this reminds of when I was younger
when I couldn't find the foundation to
match my skin I just look like a ghost
hunter right now and let someone ante
she doesn't know where to find the right
foundation color
now I'm the hundred growth I'm actually
the hunted ghost oh Lord
but why and you know what's funny like
the foundation I can definitely see that
airbrush effect that it has an airbrush
effect but it's a great airbrush effect
on me so like as a woman of color I want
to look I want to look radiant I want to
grow I want to be a Sun beam I don't
want to be an ice queen and actually
like it just started to kind of settle
in but it isn't warm and and vibrant as
I would like like a foundation to be
it's colder one that why I was mainly
wet but it is settled in nicely
I like the madness it's an oily girl
it's nice so I got the photo ready
powder to use and this color is also
medium deep I just dropped it on the
floor and broke I feel like we combine
like using like powders to set this
works actually find that powder is
actually quite nice but so for my eyes
I'm going in with the eyeshadow college
quad and this is a privatized decadence
I really do like the eyeshadow quads
from Revlon I've used them in the past
they're really really nice this is what
this quad
like color payoff is major major major I
love it and I haven't actually put any
crime or anything on my eyes and nigga
with this color here this comes on so
nice so creamy color is so pretty funny
enough to color it in as dark as I
thought it would be I'm going to go in
with my Kat Von D shade and light
palette I'm just going to add a bit of
brown and Mars as well and I'm just
going to go in with the golden chi much
in my teaser it's not sparkly as I would
like it looks like it's not on that but
they kind of are matte they're not
really shimmers but they're not really
mad love love love these two colors nice
this color the color I'm just not going
to bother trying this was not as gold as
I would have liked it to be and what I
will say is I'm a huge huge advocate of
their liners pet lip liners eyeliners
and mascara they're really really good
at Revlon and this is the color stay
liquid I pen what I'm thinking though
it's really hard to get a really nice
smooth sleek nine do you know what for
how cat candy and I just did that the
eyeliner looked good because I actually
must have some little blame Revlon that
I am using the volume and let's
magnified mascara this is the blue one
and I anything up that sourness oh yeah
I like the brush on this and something
like the formula that makes me feel like
they're going to run out quite quickly
because it is it's quite a thick formula
but it doesn't seem like there's a lot
inside here but I really like the way it
kind of fill up my lashes but I'm still
going to put some lashes on mikkel
that's just what I do but I feel like
that powdered kind of been sucked or
going to my face
so I'm going to like wipe off my palate
and I've done a contour using Bare
Minerals because they didn't have a
color dark enough for me to contour so
yeah I'm just going to do all of that
stuff now but this is the photo-ready
insta-fix highlighting stick and I saw
this and I was like oh yes and actually
this is just going to help add a little
bit more
everything's really matte but even
though it's a cream stick you rub it and
then it's like Mack comes through now
highlighter that look kind of cute I
think this is just added a bit of just a
bit of glow to my face you know I think
my camera just stopped the hot pink
wasn't wasn't wasn't it was more like a
great pink on myself so I'm just going
to go back in with my max fever which is
a favorite and there's nothing wrong
with bright pink what they need to just
have pigment you know so like I feel
like I need all of this like I feel like
I need the color add some kind of buck
to me I feel like the blush is just warm
me up a bit I just needed that let's go
in with a lip now I know some of you
guys are looking at my lips and thinking
Patricia you're literature to look like
sandpaper
I'm going to sort it out right now and
this liner they've got really good
liners I went pop some it's really
creamy it's not as dark as I would like
but it's so creamy it's so creamy I love
it
I need ten very nice I could just use it
all over that wasn't part of my plan I
just felt like I could they have these
ultra HD magnets I just fell in love
with the packaging I looked at this as
innocent gorgeous and I swore shook my
hand and love the color
oh yeah it smells like bubblegum it
smells delicious the madness is awesome
the madness is awesome that little
convoy is actually nice that combo I
don't know if that's a good on camera
but it is it's so pretty
you know easy something you find
something special that you haven't had
before my face is now done and all
together an overall it works it looks
nice and reap because we're putting on
the foundation I'm looking at like what
is this sandpaper like it looked dry but
then with a blush with the highlight
with the knit with the eye or together
it worked really well
I'm quite surprised so like that is the
end of my drugstore - and my thought on
a Revlon a smoke face makeup tutorial
what do you guys get reviews of the
finished look does it suit me do I look
cute hey guys that was different

me a thumbs up if there were any other
brands you'd like to see please do let
me know as well and I would do I only
have like almost Platt lines up that I

thought bye guys thank you for watching
