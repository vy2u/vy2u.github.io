bear face because I'm about to do a
makeup tutorial it's gonna be an
affordable and it might be more than
everyday look but I know what I'm like
it can end up being quite heavy and you
guys can judge at the end if you think
it's an everyday look or not and but
I've done affordable makeup tutorials in
the past and people like Patricia that's
not affordable and then I've kind of
realized you know what you're right
because I end up mixing a lot of
products and sometimes I have struggled
to have like the perfect affordable
foundation and and it's hard you know in
the UK if you're a woman of color view
down there on a spectrum and black and
Asian or like really pale sometimes it's
just like they forget that you exist and
all that good stuff but I'm using the
new foundations the fresh nude
foundations from the body shop
you guys might absolutely love the body
shop I've got like two shades that are
really really good for me and they also
have their new shade address thing drops
as well hello you can make your
foundation a little bit lighter or you
can make your foundation a little bit
darker and actually like to use the
darker color to contour on its own
absolutely amazing I've seen lots of
girls using there's a brand in the US
and can't remember what it's called but
loads of girls we're using the drops and
I remember when I went to the US I
wanted to buy it and it was like $40 I
was like that's expensive just to make
my foundation a bit lighter or a little
bit darker but these are really good
there's ten pounds and everything else
should be affordable and if it's not
I'll let you know but I hope you guys
enjoyed this tutorial and it's really
easy to do and to follow therefore my
base color I'm going to go in with
Carribean mahogany and what I love about
foundations like this is that you can
make it work on the different areas of
the skin tone I've got a darker chin
area but then around the rest of my face
it's a little bit lighter so I'm
actually going to add the lighter shade
adjust and drop to use on the rest of my
face so just around my cheeks and my
forehead a lot lighter than my chin area
so just blend that in with a buffer
brush and actually adds a little bit
more of the base foundation and just
blended that on in so moving on to my
brows I'm going to speed up they'll feel
like I've done my brows a million times
I've said it a million times before I
love using a gel to do my brows I like a
small angled brush and I have brows the
art not thick so I just neaten them up
with concealer which is definitely the
way to get those perfect brows so after
that I go in with my normal concealing
routine and I usually use my ring finger
because it's nice and gentle and I like
my concealing to be relatively light so
obviously shades and Justin got drops
would be perfect for this and then I go
down the middle of my face to highlight
it as well
I go ahead and use my Beauty Blender to
neat in that all up and I like to bring
my concealer quite low down my face as
well
after blending I also tap a little bit
on my Cupid's bow I'm gonna go in
actually with the darker shade adjuster
and I'm going to mix it with my
foundation to create a perfect contour
color if you guys don't know I
absolutely love using foundation to
contour my nose and actually lots of my
face I find it less powdery and less
harsh and easier to blend and you get a
much neater line so I create a little
button at the end of my nose and then
use my fingers to blend everything in
but I feel like foundations the easiest
way to really create a nice contour so
I'm setting my face with my Ben Nye
powders now these are relatively
affordable and you can buy them online
but they're definitely not drugstore I
use it to set my like highlighted areas
of my face and then I just go ahead and
use a brush to just blend it all out on
my lids I am using an I coat creamy
eyeshadow liner which I really love
as a good base and then above that I'm
using the Maybelline nudes palette which
is drugstore and it's got really nice
Browns and bronzes which are just my
favorite thing like most of the time
I'm using a matte liquid lineup from
Topshop and tibialis I haven't mastered
the wing I actually takes me quite a
while to do it but I was just sped it up
and then I'm going and using a
Maybelline mascara and adding my Ardell
cheapy lashes which I love now my
contour lots of people have been asking
about is actually Bobby Brown and Max
fever mixed together because I've not
found the perfect kind of shade for me
and I love this mix at the moment on my
lips I am using L'Oreal and this is a I
think it's called good is a really dark
plum which I love to use on the outside
of my lips and then leave the inside
where I'm adding just a matte beige
color which is from Stila so guys that's
basically my everyday affordable makeup
look so guys that is my finished look I
feel like this is realistically the look
I've been wearing a lot recently people
have been asking me a lot about it but
it it's quite natural I mean it's a
little bit harsh on the blush but I've
been loving really really harsh brush
recently and it's really easy to do
again hopefully this is really
affordable everything is more or less
drugstore or affordable the foundations
I mentioned off on the body shop they
are absolutely amazing as you can see
that someone like me can get multiple
different tones especially with the
shade adjusting drops they make a big
difference so I'm going to like
everything I use in the description bar
below bar I'm matching a rush I need to
go and catch the train in like 6 minutes
from now so I will see you guys later
thanks for watching guys bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
