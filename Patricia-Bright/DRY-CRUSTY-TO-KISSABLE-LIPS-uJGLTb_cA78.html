something that's really been affecting
me recently which has been really dry
really crapped crusty lips and there's
literally nothing I could do to keep it
moisturized they were just really
cracked really sore and just are just
not good I'm still trying to deal with
it but I'm getting there and I've got a
few tips and stuff and I just want to
show you maybe a bit about my lip regime
to kind of improve this cracked feeling
and just horrible winter dry lips so the
first thing is to check the atmosphere
basically and I mean this in terms of
one you've got to understand that is
it's winter it's really really cold that
is really gonna affect your lips and
make them really dry and your skin in
general but I found that I've been using
heaters a lot so like fan heaters if I
want that boost of warm air when I walk
in the fan heaters and sometimes I put
them on at night and I really feel like
that fan heater is what's been drying in
my lips out because it's really really
dry in the atmosphere it's just sucking
all the moisture out and it could be
things like central heating as well so I
think in terms of the atmosphere I think
one of the good things to do is
potentially if you can get a humidifier
that is a great way to come and wash
your back into the air and hopefully
prevent the kind of dry lips and so my
next tip is to get scrubbing so I
thought rather than talk about what I do
I'll show you and I use a lip scrub at
night this is a sugar base lip scrub and
all I do is like wet my lips at night
and then I apply the scrub and as you
can see it's quite grainy but it's a
great way to get rid of all the dead
kind of skin and cells and just give me
a smooth finish for the night you can
also use a toothbrush as an alternative
for those of you who don't have a scrub
and you see it goes from quite crusty to
looking a lot more supple and smooth tip
number three is to come up with some
form of regime for the day and for the
night so for me in the night I'm
literally
I use Vaseline it's not Vaseline this is
land a baby fresh it's petroleum jelly
which is exactly the same and I'll
actually put the thickest layer on my
lips at night so that they just don't
dry out through the night and that's
become my night regime and in terms of
in the day again I put my Vaseline on
but I also apply a number of like lip
glosses and stuff and I'm trying to stop
myself from cracking my lips I find that
through the day I'm peeling spits on my
skin off like with my tea so one way
I've been doing that is by having just
really really glossy lips all the time
because it feels gross and gooey if you
went dark colored lipstick as well so
you stop thinking oh I don't want that
on my teeth so you won't crack your lips
as much finally I'm just following on
from the next step is just keep your
lips really really moisturize you've
really thick gloopy and I know it sounds
really bad some people don't like glossy
lips but I think you really need to go
for more gloss type products and really
avoid matte lipsticks they're going to
make the crusty Blitz bits looked even
more crusty and it will just dry out
your lips and I've been using this or
it's like 99p from super drug and it's
an MUA when I tell laughs anyway and
it's called out plumping lip gloss and
it's so thick and so gloopy but it feels
really really good on and when it's all
like it just doesn't come off so I love
that but those are just a few tips for
those of you who've been suffering from
really crusty lips and just weather's
just horrible so yeah hope that helps
guys thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
