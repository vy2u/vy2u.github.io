pretty
hello beautiful people welcome back to
my channel I hope you are doing well
today we're gonna test something new
because it's an excellent in the market
and I want to do something where I you
know I want to spread more positivity I
know a lot of us have got hyped because
you like complaining and cussing items
that aren't great buy this thing but
it's really important to come and be
like oh my gosh this is amazing so that
is what we're going to do and we're
trying something that is four pounds
honey four pounds six and a half if not
seven dollars for my u.s. followers and
it is the new makeup revolution
concealers I have seen these being
talked about everywhere I think Holly
Boone was the first person who I saw who
did a video about this and I think
Alissa a she has also done a video about
these and these are makeup revolution
now seeing as you know we are throwing
tart in the bin for the foreseeable
future we need alternatives and
supposedly this concealer is the new
alternative and I'm really really
excited to try because the shades are
actually popping they've got a ton of
shades and they're all in the drugstore
which is really hard to do so good on
you makeup revolution hello and then I
wanted to do a little bit of reverse it
is you know high versus low and there's
also the new Urban Decay these are the
or night concealers waterproof
concealers as well so I wanted to try
these out you know try out my little for
power ones try out my 20 pound ones and
see what I think about them and how I
look and how I feel in them so yeah you
know we're gonna get rid of the hey and
we're also coming back to the season of
love February is about to be here so I
want to share some love to you guys too
so I'm gonna be doing giveaways from now
until the end of February so you go to
make sure you subscribe obviously leave
comments and also follow me on my
Instagram and my snapchat and my Twitter
and be interactive leave comment and I
we'll be picking people at random I

comments even on snapchat I'm like
you're a winner you will hopefully be
one of my giveaway winners cuz I love
hearing from you guys you know and
connecting with you guys and that
interaction is very very valuable to me
so I think I've ruffled on enough let's
get in I'm gonna go in with my moist
oh Jesus so I'm gonna go in with this
moisturizer it's a fancy moisturizer
this is from do you guys know I love the
fancy skincare and I'm gonna share more
skincare stuff with you guys in the
future and if you don't know I went to
Shanghai with deal and I'm not gonna lie
they gave me a lot of free goodies and I
was like thank you thank you very much
and the products are amazing it's really
high-quality bit more pricey but you
know invest I did get mine for free but
you guys know I invest in skincare you
guys might know one of my biggest issues
is I actually have dry under eyes so the
can get quite wrinkly especially if I've
been itching them and so sometimes where
my concealers I can look like I've
attached a bag of gravel under my eyes
like sandpaper listen we will not have
gravel eyes in 2018 so a little
moisturizer goes a long way with me
I also feel like I need to start
bringing tea back to my videos I always
have a little tea but I just haven't
kept it in shot but you know what we're
gonna just bring a tea in I'm drinking
her ball it's um raspberry I'm using
like my 50 millimeter lens which I
rarely use because it makes me like a PI
but we're here now okay so rusty laughs
watch these concealers come in 18
different shades and in the drop store
like this is levels you know they must
be doing really well because it's really
not easy to do that so I've not gone for
the darker shade the darker shade is 18
so I've got 11 12 13 14 15 and 16 here
we go that is shade C 11 that is shade C
12 and I feel like that would be my
actual under-eye shade this is C 13 C 13
is beautiful his C 14 which is in a nice
dark neutral color
here's
fifteen I swear I would use that as a
contour shade and see 16 right here
I actually think C 16 is lighter than C
15 but it's a lot more red okay makeup
revolution you try so this is basically
just one two three four five six six of
the 18 shades the rest of the shades are
lighter but it's really interesting to
see how they're looking radiant darling
right let's see what it's like on okay
so looking at this I feel like I want to
go in with shade number twelve no shade
number twelve is looking too light for
me let's go in with C 13 then it's quite
yellow the coverage is full that
coverage is full and all ready to mingle
which creamy hello you don't need a lot
of this do you know I might add a touch
of 6c c12 just the touch just a touch
just to lighten it for me a little bit
what's that blending power looking like
listen any kind of pore that was under
there has just been dissipated it
evaporated such full coverage bags
begone bags be gone beautiful I mean
there's not much more I can say this is
beautiful
okay so I'm going to let that settle in
for a little bit and then we're gonna
try the urban decay on this eye as well
the one thing I feel that with concealer
you can apply but I feel like we could
finish the rest of your face and then
you might see one you know lizard dry
creasing eye happening so it's good to
just you know see what happens
afterwards so this eye looks airbrushed
like this looks like under-eye filler
now let's try the urban decay I'm gonna
swatch them and then we're gonna find my
shade and apply it so for the urban
decay this is the all nighter waterproof
a full coverage concealer waterproof is
very very interesting and basically
there are 14 shades and I've got four
shades here which I'm going to just give
you guys a little swatch off let's just
get into it
shade is medium dark neutral this shade
here is medium dark warm which is way
more up my street this is giving me
matte formula Matt Matt Matt Matt Matt
this shade here is dark golden dark is
beautiful this looks a lot more like the
shade 13 the next shape after that is
extra deep Wow
there was no gradient there so I don't
have all the shade so that shape there
in the middle is called dark golden and
then there's also a dark neutral and a
dark warm and then there's deep neutral
which I don't have and then I got extra
deep neutral so I feel like there's a
couple of shades that I don't have in
between I didn't get mm IPR and a couple
of shades in between that I think would
help there be more of a gradient because
that was a big step but I'm not mad that
is a really nice deep dark shade for
sure right so I'm just going to go in
with the shade dark golden because I
think that one looks the best on my hand
yeah that's full coverage you have to be
careful you need to not do too much I'm
just gonna press that in with my Beauty
Blender okay that isn't moving that is
not moving
whoa can compare that to that that is
coverage very very different aren't they
this is really warm I like a warm
coverage I feel like it's drying quite
quickly you've got a move yeah that's
really good as well but I'm just looking
real close Oh mmm really close this side
is a lot warmer actually I do really
like this side as well I really like the
warmth of this concealer it's definitely
a drier formulation so don't know how my
under eyes are gonna handle it I feel
like this is like blurred out my pores a
little bit more but this one does cost
20 pounds you know and this one's giving
me good it still looks amazing
so let's be and finish the rest of my
face come back and set and see what this
is gonna look like I'm just gonna go in
with my Kevin a Kwan this is at my
skin.skin illuminating foundation just
get that all in the skin so down the
bridge of my nose I'm gonna use them
make up a revolution one and on my chin
again it's still very full coverage you
cannot go wrong with that and then on my
forehead I'm gonna go in with the dark
golden from urban decay just to
double-check so the colors are actually
quite far from each other they're not
exactly the same this is a bit warmer
okay so my battery just died and I've
had to wait so I'm hoping that it's
still just as blendable and yes
concealer is doing good down here but
yeah that urban decay isn't moving you
know Oh Lord it's really just stiff as a
board up there I feel like that of decay
concealer it dries really quick you have
to move quickly on it there is no
waiting around but uh that's now blended
in really nicely it took a little what
just a little work
this coverage coverage on all sides I
know you guys like that the light
lighter coverage on me and that kind of
jazz but you know when I see like cement
face I'm very happy I like it
should we contour these then let's
contour with these because makeup
revolution as c16 yeah well it'll be
dark yeah Wow beautiful blends in really
nicely as well okay this is called extra
deep I think it's gonna be too dark
it's very rich not gonna light it's like
chocolate you dark like dark chocolate
you dark but you know I did I just
blended it as you can see it's on a
cooler tone than that contour but they
both still work really well again the
urban decay it's a much drier formula it
doesn't move as much as this one which
can be a good thing if you hate when
you're like concealer or your foundation
moves you know I like to have a little
bit more time to work with because I'm
leisurely when I do my makeup I have a
phone call I have a meal I have a
gourmet meal in the middle of doing my
makeup I'll be talking to Monique for
hours you know and then it's a new day I
look flawless on most fronts but what I
should do is show you how I like to set
them I guess I put on my lips now my
whole face is done to be honest I feel
like both sides look gorgeous
this side is warm art than this side but
this does not look ashy this is really
nice in terms of like crease in again I
would say that this side is creased more
but it's not crease more than normal and
I haven't set my under eyes so we're
about to set ourselves set ourselves
free with some powder I'm going to use
the matte Patrick Starr I've actually
been using this powder quite a lot and
really loving it just give them a little
pet pet I feel so pretty I feel pretty
oh so pretty
and you know you've got actually likes
the Wilder from glossier so I'm just
gonna use that I feel like it's a
perfect powder for my skin tone and I
love this brush from L'Oreal and I'm
just gonna go in with some mac
mineralize don't sleep on classics
people don't sleep on classics okay guys
so that is my finished look that is the
makeup revolution of us is the urban
decay oh I didn't even set let me just
do a little set you know face set
concealer amazing on both fronts on both
fronts they're both amazing I look
flawless I mean I've just got to say it
you know sometimes you gotta be like I'm
good like you know I'm so guest right
now I'm just gonna I'm just gonna pair
it back just a little bit so finish look
I love it
I think it's fabulous I think both
concealers performed excellently again I
think where's gonna be nice I'm gonna
try and get back to you guys and just
show you my finished look like at the
end of the day but I've got to say
they're both beautiful this one's a
little cooler but it's not actually it's
not great it's perfect but in comparison
to the urban decay one that is actually
quite more yellow and rich it's
different very different formulas this
dries very quickly it's more of a matte
and it's a full coverage this is full
coverage a little bit more creamy and
you've got a bit more time to work with
it I feel like this is more like daytime
slay and this is nighttime Queen but you
know there's two different sides that's
what it's giving me but I look fabulous
if I do say so myself like come on sir
come on somebody I'm a fan you don't
need straight tape anymore you know
there's options okay guys and thank you
