video is actually head of what's a ton
actually going to be on the topic of
heartbreak and backstab in and I thought
I would do this because I kind of you
know faced a situation recently where I
realized that there people who have
confided in and trusted in who have
literally gone back and almost ruined my
life
electri no not literally but um yeah
sometimes it's the people who are
closest to you that can really hurt you
a lot and people who trust and how'd you
get through it
how did you get over the pain of you
thinking that somebody cares about you
and they really don't and I kind of want
to help people to kind of get through
these situations and often it and it
always happens with gods don't know wait
it's about girls that you know you have
you know your best pray this is my best
friend and your best friend you confide
you provide in each other your best
friend goes out and something if you go
and tell them they go and tell everybody
else and all of a sudden you are
ostracized nobody talks to you anymore
they don't like you you're made to look
a certain way because of something that
somebody else has said and that is
really a really painful thing to go
through when you know the person who you
thought runchy the most your friends who
you thought was your closest friend
turns on you and also turns everybody
else against you and I'll say you know
I've been there I have been there and
been very down but you know I really
think it's important for those of you
who are facing that for the goal in in
the playground or the common room who
nobody talk to you anymore it was giving
me the side eye I was talking about you
you have to hold your head up high
you're still just walk with pride
because any other day today's news big
news to didn't no one's gonna care about
it soon you're not going to care about
it and you just learn you just learn
from your situation and one thing I
would definitely
is that you really work out who you can
trust and who you can't trust and its
people consistent people who are
consistent in your life and as much as
you convert the fighting them they can
confide in you
somebody's gonna tell you not that
you'll see their secret yeah and you
tell them your secrets don't trust them
because they're not giving up anything
they're not giving up any kind of
weaponry and that's something I've
definitely learned I have like three
wonderful wonderful best friends besides
my boyfriend and my sister who are my
closest best friends but um like three
best friends and they have been
consistent in my life they have been
I've known them for eight years they
have never this people have never
actually hurt me funny thing is we've
met I don't think we've had argument I
think we've had a few arguments like
three arguments in seven years okay
there's one in particular so I've never
argued refer there's no needs because we
love each other I could never imagine me
telling them something and they telling
everybody else about it they wouldn't do
that and what I will say that there are
definitely seasons in your life someone
who you think is your close friend now
may not be your close friend forever
okay and there's nothing wrong with that
that is life okay
you meet a load of interesting
characters along the way you pick up on
their beautiful facets and they will
remain with you forever but you know
when you feel like that person that's
been ostracized when you feel hurt by
the actions of others they've
backstabbed you and then part broken you
how do you respond and once a you then
you focus on me is not gonna get you
through it you have to think okay
dust your shoulders off and keep it
moving
okay you move and you hold your head up
high the person who's tried to damage
your life or damage your name or damage
your reputation if you let them see that
they have succeeded they're gonna feel
very happy with themselves but when they
see that you don't even care you're
walking with your head up and your life
is going just as you want it to they're
gonna be shocked okay they'll be shocked
and you can feel good in yourself you
are amazing and that you are getting on
with
and you're not affected by what people
say and in doing that also you shouldn't
go back and you know talk about people
behind their back or you know make snide
statements don't do it don't lower
yourself to that level say well she said
that well she told me that though then
no no keep my mouth closed be a positive
person
positive energy even in negative
situations because that light will
outshine the darkness and outshine the
situation and you will look better in it
and I'm telling you now the people
backstab you will come back and
apologize which is exactly what's
happened to me the people who come turn
about you make you look bad the other is
that I'm really sorry really sorry so
let them be sorry and accept their
apology graciously but never you know
not learn from that mistake</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
