how to do it like a dude and look sexy
what you're doing that and this is all
inspired by the whole androgynous trend
that is quite popular it's always quite
popular it comes and goes but I am quite
a feminine go I like to look quite girly
and quite female and I don't want to
look butch so sometimes you could look a
bit butch with the intro Jonah's style
but I'm gonna add the bit of glamour and
pizzazz to it so I'm gonna show you five
or six different ways that I do this so
first of all it's the cut off show this
is definitely a male trend more or less
a male trend from the 90s but male trend
nonetheless so this is kind of this
style here and I got this top from
American Apparel and I love it it's got
the collar it's got some shoulders which
is great and sexy but I think that you
know you can add some more to it so one
by wearing your jewelry pieces right up
the top that really makes a big
difference and makes you look a lot more
feminine and also if you show a little
bit of midriff right over there you know
letting the shirt just hang tight up a
little bit I think that's a really
feminine look
so the next guy trend that we love is
the white tee yeah
guys always wearing our t-shirts and
they just look so fresh and sharp in
them and we can look the same too
the thing is we shouldn't go for the
same shape that a guy would wear
otherwise we're just going to look butch
but instead if we go for something with
a bit more drape and everything you
cannot really call in a basic I would
also advise wearing something
high-waisted because t shirts can have
kind of that straight thing if you cinch
it in it gives you a gorgeous silhouette
and I have American Apparel leggings
which do that to me and make me look
gorgeous and just
so the high collared shirt this is
popular we love it we love that high
collared shirt right about now and
people have been studying the shirt and
alternatives to studying the shirts is
actually adding beads and pearls and
sequins things that are more on the
feminine side if you want to look more
feminine rather than looking quite hard
I think that's a cool way to do it
so den oh yes it's always been a guy's
best friend I think most guys always
wear denim and we also like to wear it
as well but I think we can wear a bit
different to the normal stone wash and
everything and we can wear colored denim
and I love that Navy jeans right now and
I bought a pair from hmm
guys I love hmm and yeah just always wet
with heels just a nice loose feminine
top showing it a bit of clavicle and
obviously lots of accessories and again
you can feminize up your denim finally
it's the jumper and shirt combo this is
really really popular right now we love
it we love it we love it it reminds me
of my school uniform because I had to
wear a jumper and a shirt underneath but
you know it's we've come a long way from
there again with this I think adding
accessories to definitely around your
neck area and just it's quite baggy on
the tops alone something fitted or a
skirt on the bottom will definitely
feminized the look
anyway guys I hope you enjoyed that
video and I will have a what how to and
how not to video up shortly or later and
I guys see you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
