upload a video every single day forgive
me this video's more lesser chitchat and
I have a whole update towards the end of
the video or halfway through the video
yet life happens and I just got really
really busy and I were just wasn't able
to do it so apologies to you guys for
that but I want to let you know that I
have a more consistent regime regime
regimen raging whatever of like video
uploads and stuff over the next few
weeks so i'll be uploading on wednesdays
and I should be uploaded in on Saturdays
and Sundays it's getting dark now you
can hear all of the British youtubers
saying that like I let you can only
record on the weekends really and so if
I can do two or three videos which I do
kind of in advance then yeah i can
upload and stuff like that so wednesday
saturdays and sundays and I've got a new
series that could get the entire look so
it's going to be from hair to make up to
the outfit so everything all together
and really quickly and that's it really
and we're also going to say oh yes okay
for those of you who don't know already
if you're not on my Twitter my Twitter's
patio it loves you but we've booked on
emu now actually going to the Indian
Ocean and we'll be going to Mauritius so
in order for my Russia's hit me up hit
me up you know because we're going to be
on like an island well an island off the
coast of mauritius and but we want to go
in and like explore the real the real
location the real is it a country and
even know if it's contrary I think it's
just an island but yeah we're going to
be like on our island hearts and stuff
like that but anyway yeah just figure
you guys he wanted to know thank you for
all the suggestions of other locations
as well so let's get to it and I'm going
to do my whole right now it's like the
smallest hall but yeah let me just show
you what I've got so first thing is this
sleek kit which is called the berry
collection it's for Christmas and stuff
like that and what I liked about this
kit was that it's literally really nice
cool tone very collection
so there's this NYX lip cook that comes
in it and I believe it's only 8 99 or
something like that this lips it's not
what I'm wearing now but I'm actually
wearing the liner that covered this kit
and this will suit all complexions so if
you're black you're white if you're
brown whatever this will really suit all
complexions and it comes with this lip
pencil as well which is really good I've
got it on under the ruby river i'm
wearing right now and the blush the
blush is lovely again it can suit all
skin tones and it's kind of a dark plum
am at plum as well and i think it will
especially see someone who's quite pale
skinned because it just adds that you
know that want from that depth and it
even is quite good for contouring I
think so that's a nice berry kit and I
think got make a really good Christmas
present as well actually for anyone
who's thinking of Christmas presents
it's like 899 give it to a girl that you
like all your friends or something like
that I don't know why I said that anywho
so all so much to H&amp;amp;M and I've got this
like weird obsession recently it's
anything with the third trim just confer
trim your virtue him on the arms can
refer to remember colors fur trim and it
is quite expensive to get a fur-trimmed
racket so I booked rooms instead and i
bought the both for matron and this is
like a light mousy brown I do have a
darker brown but I got the mousy brown
they also have it in the gray and white
I was going to get that by didn't well i
got that pick this one up here and it
just literally makes you look rich the
second you put it on your darlings like
I just love the way they look and then
they have a black white as well which i
bought which it's great on black but
it's a shorter hair it's a shorter hair
but it's really nice and its really soft
and it and it does really help you know
if you're cold it really does warm up
these are my new kind of style
obsessions for anything that I where I
just put fur trim on it any jacket any
blazer out fur trim it just is usually
two up straight away I also went to Zara
and this is kind of intimate
from like one of my friends he has this
gorgeous um to our blazer in a mustard
color I like this mustard I need to get
someone my stuff but it was a statement
blazer and she never called white dress
and I thought wow that having a nice
statement blazer really makes a big
difference so when in tazara and bought
myself a red blazer and I'm not a fan of
red light don't really have that many
Rick clothes I really don't like red but
as a statement blazer it's well tailored
this was like 40 pounds and it's got the
gold butters and everything it well it's
quite a nautical in a sense the style of
it it's really can't know if you I don't
know if you can tell but it's got this
really cool thick thick thick texture
perfectly on point this is lovely and
it's got pockets as well and it's well
tailored so it's worth worth its money
obviously you would wear this all the
time but you know it's necessary and
essential so sticking with the kind of
essential thing while article this the
essential at all oh but you know we all
wear jeans all the time but sometimes
they can be a bit boring so i bought
these gray skinny jeans are always wear
skinny jeans and it's like you know the
cool push-up I don't fit they do push-up
but I thought that no we don't really
wear gray jeans or kind of more rugged
looking jeans and I think they're an
essential piece to have in your wardrobe
and yes why does my phone always ring
when i'm recording videos so sorry back
to the jeans some nice light dirty genom
dirty denim jeans i think are essential
we should really have quite um regularly
and these are like kind of Rick but not
ripped enough so I think this is
something i could easily customize studs
stud up Oh make look cute like stunts
the pockets or something I've been
inspired by sunny she's always studying
everything and finally again another
essential i think is a designer handbag
i finally went and
took the plunge and bought a part of egg
basically i bought it in self which is
and you can go ahead and find out online
how much it costs but i'm not going to
say but as i said you've kind of seen it
before but for me i picked this up
because it was a very classic shape and
a few of my friends have this bag or
other proud of bags and i love the way
they look I've seen that they last for
ages a friend of mine wears it to work
every single day and it looks like news
new and I was just say yet this is
really worth investing in you have to
see something like this like an
investment if you're someone who can put
aside 20 quid a week literally within
you know 10 10 months but the end of the
year next Christmas you can go ahead and
buy yourself like any designer bag that
you wanted if you if you think like that
it's really an investment into the
future and they have like minds big
enough to put everything in it in it and
stuff like that so yes I like it and
it's black I'm not gonna go by like a
bright red expensive bad then I'm not
gonna wear it regularly this I can wear
all the time although recently i'll
sleep speaking to a subby who just went
war is traveling and literally if you
bite duty-free you can get twenty
percent off twenty percent of would
actually pay for a trip for me to like
um but to somewhere anyway so i may
actually because i'm going away to
France is it France a cotton um I'm
going away somewhere my sister's taking
me away from my hendu and so I might
just go ahead and do that thereby let
you know what I do anyway how about you
that's it anywho guys I can really
brabar on can't I am apologies I'm gonna
go now and I shall see you what I don't
know what day it is today but you should
see me on wednesdays saturdays and
sundays and yes follow me on twitter
patio loved you although i don't really
use it I don't know if there's any gain
in front of me but I do make a few
comments here and there so anyway no
