that I finally did an affordable makeup
tutorial I don't think I've done one of
these and it's not like I always buy
expensive makeup or anything like that
but I rarely go to the drugstore to buy
makeup just because it is quite hard as
a woman of color to find like some
really nice stuff and I love I get a lot
of cheaper things from abroad like from
like the US and all that good stuff
but I wanted to show you an affordable
makeup tutorial that can work for lots
of different people and I basically just
use some of my favorite products that I
have and as I am doing giveaways in
every video this month I have some nice
drugstore goodies for you guys to have
as well I've got my NYX matte bronzer
and NYX adorable neutral palette I also
have some goodies from Revlon and Urban
Decay all you need to do is make sure
you follow me on my Instagram which is
Patricia bright know yeah my Instagram
is the Patricia bright my snapchat is

these goodies just do the steps that are
outlined in my description bar below but
in the meantime I hope you guys enjoyed
this video
everything is linked in the description
bar below if I could find links you can
buy it if I couldn't I'm sorry I'm sorry
but yeah thanks for watching guys and
I'll see you all later bye so guys here
is my bear face and I am putting on the
NYX shine killer it is a really nice
primer now that it's summer I really
need something to keep me nice and matte
and moving on I am using a Revlon pencil
it's a photo ready a pencil but I'm
using this on my brows now I'll be
honest with you pencil is not my
favorite on the brows but sings I'm
trying to do it affordably this would be
a great option
so tonight amiss all up I'm using a
concealer sadly I haven't found my
ultimate affordable concealer so I'm
using the double wear from Estee Lauder
I mean this concealer is amazing and it
is one of my favorites and actually it's
lasted me a really long time so it's
still kind of count moving on I am using
the B even oil control foundation which
is from super Drive this foundation is
amazing it's so pigmented and they have
a great color selection they've got
darker than me and they've got lightest
to the lightest I think it's a really
good option I go ahead and use my
concealer around my face and I'm using
the real technique brushes I love this
foundation brush it's great for my
concealer so my new favorite thing is
contouring with foundation I am using
the Double Wear foundation because it is
just my favorite but I could always use
a cheaper foundation in a darker shade
as well and I'm using this brush it's a
new brush as well and to just add more
contour I am using the B'nai luxury
powder this is the banana powder this is
about 10 pounds and I wouldn't lie to
you people this stuff is the bomb I
don't know why I just decided not to use
this for so long
but I love it and I also use the toe
hairs around my face just because it's a
bit more warmer as well but during the
summer I find that obviously I'm getting
extra oily and this really does help I
might look a bit gray now but honestly
it wears beautifully so moving on to my
eyes I'm using this jumbo pencil from
eiko it is a shadow liner and it's super
pigmented and it's a great base but you
can also use it on its own so I'm going
ahead and I'm using my favorite palette
which is from Sigma is the warm neutral
palette it's not drugstore but it is a
food born you can buy it online and I
love these colors for the summer I mean
this is kind of my standard like beige
and a bit of purple
I know these colors suit me so I like to
wear them a lot and as you can see it
really does show up and it's really
pretty
so I'm going to use a combo on the sides
of my face to give myself some color and
some arena's I'm using the NYX matte
bronze on my cheeks I'm using Sleeps
fever all my tips as well and I'm using
these Glo domes from Topshop it's kind
of give you a strobing cheek effect I
think it's absolutely gorgeous
so my liner is also a Topshop goodie as
well it is actually a matte liner and I
do notice the difference by using this
but it's actually really nice and I've
kind of become a pro at lining my eyes
or should I say that I'm not sure and I
like to add like a little dot just at
the end I think it's secret festival and
then I'm going ahead using the party
proof intense line art from Topshop as
well so I add a little bit more
highlighter to the middle of my face and
to my cheeks and I go ahead and work on
my lips I'm using the Kiko liners I've
got two different colors that I use and
you guys know these are super affordable
and they're so good almost better than
Mac actually better than that I'll be
honest with you and I'm using these BH
Cosmetics news which are my favorite
right now and I ended up changing the
lip combo
but it's such a gorgeous and affordable
look so guys that that is my summary
look I hope you guys enjoy and if you
want to see more makeup tutorials of me

leave a thumbs up but in the meantime
have a gorgeous day and I'll see you or
later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
