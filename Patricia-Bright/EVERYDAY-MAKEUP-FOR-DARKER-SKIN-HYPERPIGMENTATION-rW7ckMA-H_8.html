right today I'm going to do my updated
kind of like everyday makeup routine and
and this is basically from a request for
several follow me on instagram who is
quite grumpy that haven't done one of
these so that you know what girl I'll do
it just for you so but I know that this
is something that you guys probably want
to see as well and you might be
wondering why I look a little bit blue I
am wearing sunscreen I do wear sunscreen
now and one thing that's really annoying
about my skin tone is I do get quite
strong hyperpigmentation in the fact
that my face and my neck get very dark
like as soon as it's exposed to the Sun
and but the rest of my body does not tan
it's so annoying that I feel often not
I'm wearing like a mask
and sometimes people think I'm wearing
the wrong foundation color and not I
just have a dark face quite
significantly than my body but I'm kind
of not doing something about that so I
will hopefully address that at some
point in time but for now I'm gonna roll
with it but I do like to keep my face
protected and the sunscreen I wear is
the shishito ultimate sun protection
balls Bachchan factor 50 I love this
sunscreen yes it leaves me looking very
very blue so I have to wear makeup when
I wear this sunscreen but I don't work
in the winter and so but it works really
well as a primer I use it kind of like a
primer before
Foundation and the foundation I'm
currently using is the Lancome it's
great for oily skin and I have found
that my skin has become a not oily or
late I'm not sure why but you getting
there
now my concealer I have been using for
years it is the Kevin acquire the
sensual skin enhancer and I use it in a
color 12 it is quite light it's probably
about 2 or 3 shades lighter than me
maybe before but I use it just to
highlight the main areas of my face
back to you so my eyebrows are tweezed a
little bit I really don't have much I
browse sadly mommy didn't give me those
genetics so I do pencil them in oh and I
try to use a sharp pencil this is the
Rimmel eyebrow pencil and it's in a dark
brown
baby
our sister's not twins and they're never
going to be perfectly matching this
eyebrows always higher than these
parallel it's just the way they are
naturally
back to you back to you back
so that is my brows done and I have been
using the same contour kit for a very
long time it is the sweet contour kit
I've not found a good alternative
contour so I will stick to using this
for my blush I'm going to use the
Charlotte Tilbury it's the cheek to
cheek swish and pop blush up and just
lay a bit of comments more of the
bronzer on me I think now I'm going to
have an oily day that I will put powder
on but I don't really like wearing
powder but I use the Mac deep dark I
don't know what powder this is this is
like a loose powder I don't know what
it's called I love this eyeshadow duo
it's called Tsuburaya it's from NARS and
it's just really nice bronzy Browns
which are almost quite ready as well
but if I'm not using that the Sigma
neutral palette is my favorite at it it
is my favorite palette and I usually
just use these two colors then perfect
the eyeliner I'm loving is from the new
collection from urban decay and this is
the ink for eye precision liner it's
very very good
so for my lips I would always line my
lips I either use burgundy for mac or a
color called chestnut but today I'm
gonna wet Burgundy
today I'm using exotic island it's a lip
gloss from actually tanning Birds
collection which I really like I wore it
all of last week so it's nice and bright
and pink so that's my everyday makeup
look now for the purpose of videos I
always wear eyelashes because they
really do make you look a lot better but
I don't wear eyelashes everyday I would
love to but too much hassle so guys that
is my everyday makeup with the addition
of eyelashes and it's super quick and
super easy for me to do I probably do my
makeup within 20 minutes ish and then I
really only switch up my lipsticks and
lipglosses and my eye shadow but give it
a thumbs up guys really do like
especially if you maybe want to see a
bit more makeup things I don't often do
makeup but you know it's quite fun when
you do do it okay guys thank you so much
watching and I'll see you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
