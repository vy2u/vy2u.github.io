whores
it is a Primark haul a Primark haul that
might change your life
I'm just playing with you guys I have a
Primark call for you today I am very
very proud or some of the goodies that I
got in Primark recently that were not
planned I literally got a suitcase load
literally a suitcase as of well because
of the amount of stuff that I got but I
was really really happy with it if you
don't go to Primark a lot then you're
like oh my gosh when you do go in this
like you try and get everything it's
actually really really good fun I'm
gonna do tips shopping in Primark video
or a blog post or something at some
point in time so you guys know I have a
little bit of a little obsession I
always have I think I always will
you can never find the perfect pair of
leather trousers until today
these are leather trousers I got them
they were Hampshire they they were 17
pounds and they're amazing they fit
really well they've got like knee detail
and you guys know I love little things
with detail that are in clothing
it's got just perfect detailing it's got
a little ankle zip and I'll be honest
with you I actually bought these in a
size tip m12 because the size 10 was
solid out and I was like I'm not letting
you go I'm gonna make these fit I'll
gain weight to make these fit but no
they actually fit okay I just need to
wear them with about I think the 10
would have been actually perfect if
anyone can get me a size 10 like
literally I'll pay you double for the
size 10 of these but I also bought some
skinny jeans as well um I saw a pair in
another store like really nice white
skinny jeans but went in to Primark
found these they fit absolutely
wonderfully and are great for the summer
they're exactly what I want for
spring/summer and I was I've got to buy
these and I think they were about
not sure how much they were actually
there about 12 pounds or 15 pounds I
then brought another pair of skinny
jeans they're skinny connection was
actually really good like you could get
little basics from black your white to
denim all sorts and I bought a light
blue skinny pair of denim jeans and what
I might about them is that they had a
bit of distressing and I get started it
off now if I want to put more
distressing into them I probably could
and I might do but and like these as
well okay guys these shoes these shoes
there's actually no words like I'm I'm
getting to that place where comfort is
really important to me these shoes are
like slight walking on clouds like like
you can take dance in the street in
these shoes they're so so comfortable
and they're so cute like they've got the
contrast color the blacks the black is
black the front is blue and I wear these
are skinnies I wear these with skirts I
wear these baggies I just wear these all
the time right the day I got them I
think I put them on like after I left
this dog like my feet are hurting me
these are six pounds I bought two pairs
because it was that good here's the
second pair that I bought these are in
the white with the black again I haven't
worn these ones but I know they're gonna
be really comfortable I'm going on
holiday and so I can't wait to wear
these while in Thailand and just being
comfortable no beach girl beach girl PF
comfort is the answer I feel really good
I've got a good spectrum I've got black
I've got Y I've got blue
I've got black again and it's these like
what would you call them they're no bit
like jogger pants but not jogger pants
they're really comfort slouchy pants in
my K a chiffon knit fabric and it's got
ruched ends and a ruched waist
I did buy these in a size 12 so I could
get a nice baggy look again work within
the old crop top or bikini and throw
this on the bottom they're really lovely
you guys are not believe I've got this
jacket it's probably getting a bit
Walmart to wear
something like this but something like
this would be a classic in a closet and
it was this leather jacket the thing is
is that this was actually on sale like
there were no words that this was on
sale people and literally hunting around
there and I was like getting in there
couldn't find my size but again I don't
mind buying exercise clothes that are a
bit oversized because you can stain it
in a really cool way and but I love the
jacket from the outside it looks like a
really worn old leather and it's got a
fleece on the inside so it would be
super warm this went from 25 pounds to
10 pounds to 10 pounds and while I was
hanging around the cell rail I found
another jacket this was also on sale I
don't know what it went down to actually
but it was originally 25 pounds and it's
this red biker jacket I did get this in
my size and seeing as I'm trying to be a
bit braver with color I feel like ready
the color that I do really like on me
and I'm sure I could sell this in a
really nice way next I really wanted an
oversized scarf and fooled the winter
and I could still probably wear it now
but who knows and I just have always
been looking for one found this one here
it's got mice bobbles and everything on
it and this was three pounds as well it
was in the sale it was eight pounds down
to three pounds but it's one of the
really big ones some of the ones I've
seen recently a really short but PC how
big and like cozy is it's really really
nice now I also bought a little right
that's kind of like a parka jacket but
not really a parka jacket it's more of a
like just a wet jacket and I think this
would be great for my holidays and also
when it's like I don't know a bit when
it's warmer weather but you might want
something like to wear and I just like
the way these and look versus their
practicality I lots of us love the
oversized jumper look I found this jump
it's got all these really cute little
bubbles on it
and it's nice and light
loose and floaty and really comfortable
it's the kind of thing you can lay out
with a lot if you want to or you can
just wear it on its own it's just a
really nice jumper I wish I'd got it in
more colors but it's the kind of thing I
would wear everyday like just throw it
on but I also bought this other jumper
and I just loved it it's like a nice
bright white but it's got this really
nice intricate triangle detail embossed
into it I've worn it already it's on a
blog post and I just love it like this
is my kind of fit in my kind of shape
for a top so I didn't stop myself I
bought myself a bikini um
I have quite a few from a couple of
other stores that I'll try and show you
but I really needed like a nice bando
black set so I can mix and blend between
different bikinis I don't like people in
bikinis I'm really really matching
matchy so hopefully I'll use these
bottoms for another set and use the top
for another set as well but their sets
of bikinis or six pounds
some places you go for bikini as you're
looking at you know 18 pounds for the
top put so yeah so moving on to
accessories I bought this really nice
chunky statement later necklace from
Primark I was just like this is such a
nice piece I actually styled it with
that job car and but I could wear on
anything that was really really simple
just throw this on to add that lots of
drama to it and sticking with drama
necklaces I also got this one it's got a
little bit of an Aztec print going on on
it and I just thought this is really me
like that's the kind of thing I love
triangles like I think I have an
obsession with triangles and like Aztec
style as you can see and I saw this and
I thought this is definitely calling my
name
so guys Primark has also got beauty and
someone mentioned this to me and they
sent back the beauty collections
actually really good so I was like okay
I'm going to go and try this and see
what's there and they had a whole bunch
of things there that I definitely want
it so I just got a nail buffer which was
I believe it was one pound I need one of
these take it away of me put it in my
bag you can never go wrong with a nail
buffer and they had a brow pencil as
well it looked like a nice dark brown
and it's got a spoolie at the end I'm
desperate for new Spoony so I'll see how
that goes
that was also one pound they also had a
nail art pens actually someone told me I
think that's Beca Rosie she was telling
me about the nail art pens that they're
really good so I was like okay I
definitely want to try those do a couple
of now designs they have black white and
this pink and black and white I would
definitely use to do some nail art and
this was two pounds of three male art
pens can't go wrong with that and then I
also bought a set of their PS love nail
polishes one of the connection is
actually called PS love and these are
just ink colors that I might like move
and golds and a little bit of glitter
because I'm a little bit glitter girl
now and I also bought this Sunkist
shimmer dust brush obviously on the
beach sunkissed Beauty I want to be
glowing you know glowing bronze black
flower bronze goddess so can't wait to
get this on the right parts of my body
and I also bought a facial water girl
they were selling all the miniatures
from different ranges with Nivea to to
vast me so this I'll probably take with
me on vacation finally as I said I
actually bought a suitcase
I bought this suitcase from Primark now
excuse this bit of goo that's down the
middle they had to put a sticky thing
over it but it's kind of left the mark
I'm going to wash it off but I bought
this suitcase which is kind of like a
snake skin of a mock snakeskin design
which I thought is really really cute
and it's cap in sizes so for my cabin
luggage I'm gonna take on something like
this on the plane of me and it was
really it's really big inside and I need
one
anyway so talk to you I literally bought
a suitcase full and I just put
everything in it after hoods so guys
that is my Primark haul I really hoped
you enjoyed it I might try to do them a
bit more regularly and see what gems I
can find and hopefully if I get the
video in time you guys will be able to
find some of the goodies as well but
good it's a bit of a hunt like if you
want to be serious about Prime what you
really need to take like an hour to
really go down every aisle like that's
what I did and then sometimes you'll go
in the queue and then you'll see a girl
and you're like what was that I didn't
see that item and I actually did that
with one of the tops class all ago and I
was like oh my gosh that's amazing was
that formally runs back downstairs so my
god dude tips for shopping in Primark
video or a blog post I shall definitely
do that and yeah that's about it and I
hope you enjoyed and make sure you check
