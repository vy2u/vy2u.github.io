can do that better than you
they go hey guys welcome to my channel
today I wanted to talk about something
that I have been reflecting on in my
life quite a lot recently
number one was I'm a little bit mental
not not even like I don't have that many
friends have a lot of quaint esteem but
I don't see friends on a daily basis or
anything like that and and number two
was that I reflected on the people who
have come in and out of my life and I
wanted to talk about friend versus
friend amis and if you guys don't know
what a friend of me is it's basically
your friend enemy and so much every
person has this kind of trajan in their
life you might even be the frenemy you
don't even realize you don't recognize
it but if this concept of you might have
that friend being online who actually
isn't an edifying to you and you know
you need a friend can actually be or you
yourself are not the most edifying
friend being your friend's life and I
think it's really important to get to
places you're like you know what I
almost need you do anymore
they're friendly number one the flaky
frenemy that friend who says they're
gonna do something cause be somewhere go
get something for you and they don't do
it last minute they floss so I'm going
to put my hand up and say you know what
I have been that friend I have
disappointed friends and not turned up
and it's not a nice person to do don't
be really excited yes of course I'm
definitely going to be there yet know
for sure for sure and if you can't wait
but when it actually hits the fan oh
really
did I did I did I say out doing that
yeah no something came up I hope it goes
well and when they really become a
friend of me is when I keep doing it
over and over again and it starts to
hurt you those kind of people now let's
make peace with it be oh what a lot a
snaky friend and me that's when a me
soon I'll give you all the teeth in the
world up in your face but behind your
back
is all kind of like and I think one of
the things that you can identify about a
snaky frenemy if they wanna talk about
other people a lot to you and the next
thing you see them with purses or all at
that point in time you need to learn
their ways are all kinds of glittery
they're the kind of people you need to
avoid and I think eventually making
people show their true colors they're
excellent at smiling in your face yes
girl oh my gosh you look amazing
oh my gosh you've done that so much
better than Rebecca like honestly
honestly nobody DCO and then what she
was thinking most make the friends
eventually you're going to eat at your
self esteem because you never feel quite
sure about them and I think it's really
important to have friends in your life
that you feel sure about that friend who
is always late this is nothing more
frustrating than the late friend it
sounded like a no I'm on my way I'm
coming baby I'll be there I'll be there
hey babe where are you some look she
just around the corner like just around
the corner there's nothing more
infuriating than the permanently late
friend it just makes you feel like you
know what my friend is it reliable
sometimes that friend you either learned
it fit that they're going to be late and
lie to them about the time and tell them
that you know what if it's an hour
earlier and that's not the kind of
friends that you want to have in your
life I always say a life and death is in
the power of become and if you have a
friend so they never have anything good
to say about something you're wearing
something you're doing something you're
excited about as soon as you say it
they're like that's not going to work
but where does he like you it's probably
going to go wrong in that I don't think
you should even bother I don't think
that's a good idea
so it's kind of Negative Nancy just
eventually eat at your self-esteem all
the time it is better to have friends
who will build you up with positivity a
positive response the right wording can
makes you feel good not that worthiness
going to make me feel like let crush
like every when you say something you
feel crushed because they just shut it
down you need those kind of people in
your life the compare different oh my
god
I thought you do such things this friend
like oh I've already done that
that's almost as good as mine I was
gonna do that let's go you look good but
Alec better shut that a little bit
healthy competition is a good thing
because I limit sharpens iron but if
your friend is constantly competing
against you they might have a slight
problem and actually maybe don't want
the best for you and maybe see you more
as a competition than a friend the use
of friends and it hurts because you kind
of like the user friends you give a lot
of yourself to that's when and then you
start to realize hmm it's slightly off
balance
they're usually there to get what they
can out of the friendship be it material
things I love that how bad you've got
can I take it be it not working got an
important event who's gonna be there
they're just any kind of for themselves
and not really to build the relationship
and I find that these kind of people
slide into your life a little bit later
it's not maybe when you have achieved
something we've got good at something or
you're kind of smart and when you're no
longer of value to them they go in
cutters in and and here's and then we
don't see them they've walked off
arm-in-arm with a new friends will help
they God their God they don't have to
cause they don't text back they're
nowhere to be seen
that frenemy was a user but you want to
know that the people in your life are
just there to take what they can to
undermine er this is a sad but true
taste friendship that friends who likes
to bring you down and like slide dances
like jokes especially in front of other
people you have to see Mary's veto look
at se her ankles are though it's like
them
Minto I have ever seen you need to see
machine looks like this out make up that
person who must always highlight what
you don't have or what you've got wrong
especially in front of people they're
bringing you down to make themselves
feel better
alright guys because those are some
examples of a frenemy that might be in
your life as much as there's an element
of liquid I want it to be kind of funny
or kind of a joke I'm saying Beth I
wanted them to be reflective it's
important to have friendships that are
true and deep and actually some of these
points you might want to reflect and I
think you know what is that me is that
the person I am in a friendship and it
made me something that you might want to
reflect on and change where you can so
guys I hope you enjoyed that video and
found it useful if there are any other
types you want me to have a little one -
