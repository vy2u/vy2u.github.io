so I thought I would put a little
lookbook together for you
so first things first it's a jacket I
love this jacket because to be honest
most of them are quite frumpy but you
have to wear your jacket listen here
it's really warm and I love the leather
sleeves that it's got I'm just pairing
this with a pair of skinny jeans that
you're from H&amp;amp;M and you guys all this in
my last haul video
so next it's all about that casual
caller I love nothing more than wearing
a pair of skinny jeans with a pair of
converses and putting on the jumper with
it
and I absolutely love this jumper cause
it's kind of Christmassy without being
like really cheesy and awkward
so who says you can't wear shorts in the
winter plenty of people but do you know
what I really don't mind I think if you
keep yourself wrapped up on the top like
I've got my leather jacket and the third
you Leigh I really feel fine on the
bottom half
I love these tights they're really old
but I love the kind of design on them
they really do stand out and as you can
see I just hang around in the
countryside and I've actually got a blog
post on this so make sure you check out
my blog moments or starcom
so next is all about the skinny jean
they are very very comfortable and you
can't go wrong I just pay with my
leather jacket that I've been wearing
for Oh almost over a year now which I
absolutely love and you guys will see I
have notified that I've got very chunky
fat hands but um yeah I'm just paying
the pair of boots which I absolutely
love therefore misguided as well
and let me tell you it was super windy
here like cold and windy but you know I
was absolutely fine
I wore my denim jacket from Urban
Outfitters and a pair of riding pants
which I'm probably gonna come to the
grave with me I love these so I just
planned this look man it's simple jumper
and a simple chain and I'm good to go so
guys let me tell you I was in feeling
myself on that beach I was mother Helene
so I got let me know if you would
actually wear shorts in this kind of
weather hey old lady
so guys thank you so much for watching
please remember to Like and subscribe
and if you haven't checked out my blog
for moments of style.com make sure you
do because I've got lots of stuff about
my trips and what I get up to in life so
thanks for watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
