like an autumn no not an autumn or just
a ball video and I basically decided I'm
gonna try and leave them more regular so
that I don't have a whole mass of things
to show you and I do have quite a few
bits here anyway so I'm just gonna go
through and go let you see what I got so
the first thing I have is basically an
autumn jacket and this jacket is from
pun and bear which is basically it's a
concession of Zara and I don't know if
you can see but it's kind of like a gray
white really lovely boyfriend blazer
style jacket and it's got these really
gorgeous slanted pockets and the lining
on the inside is like my favourite
colour which is this kind of maroon
color so it's absolutely gorgeous and
that only cost me 48 pounds and I bought
this out on the fashion night out in
London and I had never gone into Pulham
bear it before it's a component barrier
or Pullen bear anyway pull a bit I've
never been in there before
and if they had like music blazing and I
was with the girls and it was just so
fun somebody just enticed us in got in
there and as I come with gosh it's
amazing in here and then they had 20%
off so I think the jacket is a written
these 60 pounds but I got it for 48 and
it is so gorgeous and must show you this
kind of stuff on so I've worn this so it
may look a bit crusty but it's this
white blazer which is from H&amp;amp;M and if
you what do you guys follow me on
Instagram I hope we do I put my link
below and follow me on Twitter I wore
this to a wedding and I worked like a
purple corset dress which I'm going to
show you literally reach the popular
pages although my husband was in it and
he is kind of buff so you know yeah yeah
so I wore this and it's so gorgeous it's
so elegant I had to get a size 6 because
they didn't have any other sizes yet and
I can't button it up but it was worth it
was worth it on that outfit so the next
thing I got was this dress which is you
know maroon is really back up Aroon got
Purple's is really becoming my
and it's basically a corset dress and I
hope you can see the details it's got a
sweetheart neckline and it's just got a
ruching down here as well and just the
band there and this is the dress that I
wore to the wedding that time and it's
just so gorgeous and so lovely on and
this is from Oasis although I bought it
from Selfridges dot-com and that was 45
pounds so I also went to monkey and
basically the Persian babe made me go
there yeah she made me go there because
she has these like really nice casual
vests and t-shirts which she I think
she's just got the vest and she bought
them in Woking they were about five
pounds I'm headed up buying three
because they're just five pounds but
they're a really nice texture like I
could wear them to work so this is the
one I got in maroon and it just fits
really gorgeous you may have seen it in
my recent videos you might see me
wearing this color a lot so there's this
one here I also bought a white one this
is the white one and then you'll support
the gray one which looks like that so
these are really good basics and
classics to really have in your wardrobe
just to throw on and to use for layering
they're absolutely amazing
so from Zara I picked up this quilted
bag and it was only 19 pounds I bought
it about two weeks ago two or three
weeks ago but they still have it in
store and look at that how Chanel esque
is that and it's fairly large and then
the hardware is like a not too much of a
garish gold it's almost like a silvery
gold because it's really really nice
really really elegant I love that
because I'm not buying this you know red
now so I'm really into like Paisley
patterns or just patterns in general I
believe this is a paisley pattern and
these are some trousers which are from
Topshop really nice kind of cropped and
they remind me of my floral trouser as
well they have the same shape as the
floor chances that I have from warehouse
and I think as we're coming into autumn
I wanted to go for something a bit
darker but I could lay out like I could
wear this out
like a white shirt but I could also put
a sweater on with it and it would look
really gorgeous but as I saw someone do
it and these are 45 pounds so I ended up
buying these Jeffrey I don't even know
what they're called people always know
the name of shoes I don't know I just
buy what I like and um I bought these
shoes there Jeffrey Campbell's they're
not litres there's something with the
others what are they I don't know but
there's a warning in there saying watch
out lady are studded shoes are spiky
please be careful it's hilarious so yeah
here are the studded shoes and the
inside there's kind of a flex cards and
these are more Popo key stars okay but
they are absolutely gorgeous I wore them
in the fashion right pal and I just love
love love these they were there were 120
pounds but I got them for 85 I can't
remember why I got them for 85 but I've
got them for 85 not quite sure where I'm
gonna wear it to Michael thinks that
they look like some kind of Gothic like
I want to kill myself shoes like Michael
you just don't know fashion hmm and
actually it's quite funny like
everything I've bought recently I've
actually been wearing so I've really
been taking my shopping like I've really
consider what I'm buying now before I
just buy stuff and it's just sitting in
my wardrobe I've had a massive clear out
as well so yeah that's interesting okay
so this necklace here again I wore this
to the wedding and it's like ah it's
like a really chunky studied silver
necklace and I just love how chunky it
is let me show you that on how cute is
that how gorgeous is that you can wear
it really like a low neck like this you
can work with a t-shirt you can wear it
on a really casual outfit and it just
judges everything up you know you also
bought this necklace from forever 21 now
my sister laughed at me
she said why are you buying some granny
crystal looking necklace thing but do
you know what I've really developed a
love for crystal style stuff and I think
it's from when I met Whitney Whitney it
had like a massive chunky dye Monte
still chained and it looks so elegant
and I was like do you know what it just
depends on the way you wear it and this
is a bit bright I'll probably like make
it a bit more antique if you want to see
me antique this then leave a comment
below and I'll do a video on it I'm
definitely going to make it look more
antique and I think it's really really
chic with the right outfit finally I
wanted to UM I did get sent me stuff
right but I do get sent a decent get
sent quite what I get requested to
review a lot of things I just don't
review a lot of things just because I
don't often like the quality of some
stuff but I was contacted by romwe and
I'd seen them before and I'd seen them
on some other people's blogs I was like
yeah yeah I see some of your stuff it
took all what I won't like it took a
while for the stuff to get to me it took
like two weeks but when the stuff came I
was shocked I was like are you guys
joking me this stuff was so amazing and
they've got their trends like they're on
a trend if you want trend stuff they've
got it that they've got galaxy they had
galaxy clothing from two months ago now
two months ago people are just getting
on to it now they're so on point and so
and they stopped coming really amazingly
package and it is high-quality so I got
this jumper here right and I thought
this is gonna be lovely for winter and
it's got these shoulder thingy Bob's
here really cute and it's got like a
little dumb Monte stud here this is like
a really really nice quality I don't
know if it's cotton or wool I don't know
what texture is but it's lovely I also
picked up this show I think style Susie
or size this year I love this kind of
peachy color and I don't know if you can
see but the color is lace and how God oh
my I might put this on she'll just put
this nut up a little and lit up her own
layer and if you guys want me to like
show the stuff on when I hold them just
leave a comment and then I'll do like I
might be a little separate thing where I
showed the items on I just don't know if
it's worthwhile so let me know it's
really nice with you I love this show so
I also picked up this like Navy shirt
not quite sure I think I want it for
layering and put like a sweater over it
I think that's them
I had with it but it's a really nice
shot I can even wear this to work and oh
yes it's a very long shot to clean worn
as a dress I don't know if you can see
that and finally I picked up this gray
sweat are very much getting ready for
autumn I just love this it looks so cozy
but it's actually the weather's been
quite good recently you wouldn't think
it was September but um yeah this is a
cardi that I got also and finally I
picked up a fragrance from Zara and I
never buy this album radiance is
fragrances but I have heard a lot about
them and that they're really really nice
and my sister worked like I was at the
till and my sister just you know sprayed
this from about from well away and I
said hmm
what is that and it was this Zara black
pian I think it says peony and it was
only ten pounds and it smells so so so
good and I think the bottles actually
really cute so guys that is the end of
my haul video I should have another one
up do thumbs up if you like cause and
you want to see more do you want me to
spend more money and also if you want me
to do wearing out their items in the
hall then let me know and I'll start
doing that it might be nice up okay guys
