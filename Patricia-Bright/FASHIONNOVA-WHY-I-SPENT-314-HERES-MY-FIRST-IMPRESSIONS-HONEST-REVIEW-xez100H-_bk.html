not a good look
my booties popping a little bit and I
guys welcome to my channel today's video
is about to be a little bit different
it's a bit fun I've been thinking about
it for a while and we are about to do a
live unboxing from fashion over before
we dive into this treasure trove I
haven't actually opened anything I've
not seen it so I'm quite excited as you
can see in my face I've been like saving
this for this video it's almost like a
fashion over review I felt the need to
do this video because all of my feet I
see people talking about fashion over
wearing fashion over from the richest of
gangue girls - Fortius of pop girls
fashion OVA is all over the place and
the truth of the matter is that most
people are being quote sponsored or
being paid to wear the outfit style the
outfits and take pictures in them and I
have got no problem with doing that
because I obviously do sponsorship
myself this is not sponsored by fashion
/ but I if you guys have watched you for
long enough you will know that I were
marketers during i buy i watch info
commercials i watch QVC and i buy those
things and they have infiltrated me
enough to say you know what i'm gonna
buy some stuff from fashion oh god I
think I ended up spending about $400 and
that's because I wanted to try a little
bit of everything like I'm not gonna lie
I wanted to try even some jeans some
clothing I wouldn't normally wear but I
wanted to do a live unbox it since I
could give you the real deal the real
kind of tea on how good this stuff
actually is first things first shopping
on the website right I went on to the
website I felt not inferior but the
Builder bodies that I saw I was like wow
like I've never seen hip so wide sizes
thick bumsang Brown boobs so tight and I
just say how does any of this clothing
gonna look good on me because my body is
not set up that way my boy
is set up the shape of the tooth I do
not have weight so I want little waist a
little booty but nothing like the
coca-cola colours that the girls on the
fashion name of the website hide and so
that was the first thing that hit me
like these girls were and I found it a
little bit not disheartening but it just
made me feel like oh my gosh I don't
look like that all these clothes gonna
look good on me then the next thing I
noticed was that the craving was a
little bit raunchy and I love a bit of
want you know I've got a little bit
cleavage out today I have no problem
with that bunch of spite do I really
need to wear a see-through vest with my
nipples are like it wasn't it wasn't
necessary for me but if these kept
cooking there were actually some poor
pieces quite nice pieces very trendy
very Instagram and the prices were good
now when it came to delivery and also
I'm based in the UK I think this is
based in China I didn't pay any income
taxes or whether you know those import
duties I didn't end up having to pay
anything but you never know in three
weeks from now you can't get one of
those friends comfort your doors and
it's so irritating I bought some stuff
from Kylie Jenner calm and it ended up
being 17 pounds which was basically the
price of the items that I bought I was
like that's so rude so yeah and it took
about seven days to come so actually it
wasn't that bad so price-wise good
delivery wise good I will let you know
if I end up getting the tax or fine at
some point in time but that was my
thoughts so now let's get into this the
cream of this video which is actually
the clothing all just comes in the more
like plastic packaging and you know when
you forget what you actually bought
that's mean right now okay this is $32
we're gonna try and as we go okay okay
it fits nicely feels really fitted this
looks a bit cheap and a bit weird up
here but it fits and also I think even
if I took off my bra it would still look
kind of appropriate but sometimes you
get things that are really low V and
actually we get nipple exposure but this
one is covering their nipples
well I'm not mad at it this is a nice
little holiday piece oh and my booties
popping a little bit
there isn't much there so that's what
things I did okay I'm not mad at that
I'm not mad at that at all but let's
stop we are gonna get into some fashion
over jeans picked up a size seven oh I
did find the sizing and get a bit
confusing as well especially looking at
the models and thinking about what my
body shape looked like it did look a bit
boom but we'll see here are the jeans I
can tell they're gonna be too big so I'm
definitely not a size 7 I don't even
know what size 7 is they're very
stretchy they don't seem that bad it
says how many USA but let's try these on
anyway okay so here are the jeans on now
they are a bit big if I could really
have a lot more fit going on in there
can get my hand in there but overall
they're not actually that bad a jean
quite stretchy
they feel really comfortable I thought
the pockets are actually in a good
position to kind of give you a good
shape the top on the other hand I like
this style I like the fit however the
material is kind of a cotton and spandex
I feel like as soon as you wash this
it's gonna bubble up in the wash like
mad okay next up this car key bummer
something about it I really don't like
again it's like your choice of what I
made for me the rips in it are just
doing the ultimate most however how much
was this $32 hmm hmm think it's a touch
pricey because it it doesn't feel that
that fancy but I wonder if it was meant
to have short arms or do I just have
particularly long arms so over here we
have this camo jacket I love a bit of
camera if you guys know me I lost some
camo the arms are very short don't know
if they're meant to be like cropped and
rolled up which I can do however if
they're down
hmm not a good look I don't hate it but
I hate the arms like this is ridiculous
you need to be lal you need to be sure
okay oh my gosh okay so I got the
infamous suit this is the leggings and
it's got the top Kylie was wearing it
there's also a plus-size model who also
wears it let's see what I look like in
this okay let's say you can kiss I'm in
it this set is called the we should be
together set I wouldn't go out in this
but it isn't awful again the sleeves are
doing some kind of either cool thing on
me maybe I've just got ridiculously long
arms maybe it's meant maybe this is the
style I don't know let's just let's just
rock this hoodie people yes I mean who
knows who goes out in crop tops and
leggings it's not really my thing
however these are good leggings I want
them in black I've really liked these
let Megan's like they are flattering
they look nice and they're not giving
you like that camel toe fold exposure
thing that you sometimes get at the
crotch I set the crotch it just kind of
looks cool booty I mean telling that's
depressed but that's good I probably
need to do a bit more scoring the top
for me is a nonsensical ooh I have a
crop top with lace up and a hoodie
doesn't make any sense
leggings badass really like them this is
absolutely beautiful if you're going on
holiday or if you're going away however
it is doing the thing I said that when
you get kind of a really low V and I'm
telling you one wrong slip and it's over
it's completely and utterly over you are
just a nipple away from nudity but this
is gorgeous I had something like this
from Zara but it wasn't even as pretty
as this and actually the front isn't it
actually isn't too too bad a little bit
of booby tape and I'm set it's got
shorts on the inside
gosh I'm literally in love I'm in
shockingly in love that's Russian over
why why would you do this to me I what
I hate you I wanted to hit you oh my
gosh
okay so here's this dress here it's a
bit of a wear why do you have it dress
but again I will say that it is really
really gorgeous funnily enough it's also
got lining on the inside so this really
stops you from getting showing about
your underwear so have a look at that
that is really thoughtful it fits really
well it's kind of helping me like hide a
bit of the lumping and a little bit of
the bumping again I'm not mad at it and
I always want like something that's got
long sleeves and a round there and this
has that in space
yeh something I can have a actual
genuine gripe about this piece here no
bueno doesn't fit how it's meant to fit
is just hanging all kinds of low and
yeah it's probably to me should be like
that I've had to put the vest on
underneath just so that I can you know
I'm not showing you my entire breast
this entire time so it shouldn't fit
more like this and then the slits on the
side are just they're just a bit too
high actually the bats not bad it just
doesn't do the right thing all over
however if you're wearing something like
this to the beach it's kind of a seafood
dress in a way I doubt you care and for
me I would just kind of pull it up or
like tie it at the back and just wear it
beach wise but yeah the comments
fabulous the material is does what it
says on the tin but the fit isn't doing
what it's meant to be different so this
jumper I've already worn and I've
already got makeup on it I really like
it it is kind of the kind of sweatshirt
material but really thin so I don't
really know if it is a sweatshirt or
isn't but yeah it's kind of a thin
jumper it's not a jumper that's gonna
keep you warm but what I like about it
is that it's got it says antisocial
antisocial I'm not really the most
antisocial person as well but I want it
to be cool so I thought it was really
nice but it's got really long sleeves
which I'm fine so much more flattering
and I took a picture of this
it was mean Gracie yeah that works so
it's kind of cropped it's loose I love
the shape and fit of this however the
price is $24 and to me that is doing the
most pour a thin jumper it really needs
to be about $12 right like literally
half price right okay oh I felt kind of
out of breath now all right so my
overall thoughts when it comes to
fashion Ava and based on the items that
I picked is it really actually isn't
that bad and I don't know why in my mind
I thought some of these sites are a bit
dodgy you don't know much about them and
you see a lot of people being paid to
promote it that you're just like hmm
really
but the clove in that cane was actually
okay and in some circumstances really
nice and acting quite thoughtful the one
thing I will say is that I out using
that price wise it should be a little
bit cheaper because if you're looking at
$32 you know these are Zara prices and
actually you can get the same thing in
Zara and H&amp;amp;M so why not just go to H&amp;amp;M
which you can go to and you're like
local high street however if there's
something you've seen on fashion over
that you can't see anywhere else that
you really like then I would say go for
it I mean the items are quite cool quite
trendy so if you want a trendy look you
can definitely find that on fashion over
I didn't get scammed because that was
one of my fears like my money would be
taken and I wouldn't get anything I
don't know why I thought that but you
never know overall it was a pleasurable
experience so fashion over go okay guys
so I hoped you enjoyed that video and
that's the first time I've done kind of
like a clothing first impressions review
if you want to see more of those if
there any stores that you want me to try
out like she in or Zach four I'm gonna
give you guys the teal on that as f-4
actually cuz yep we're gonna save if you
want to see that give me a thumbs up and
we're gonna get right into it so guys
thank you so much for watching I will
have the items linked below and because
they're actually not that
and yeah in the meantime I will see you
guys in detail bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
