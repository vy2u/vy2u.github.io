hey guys welcome to my channel as you
can see I have a guest I have a meaning
she has coming and I visited us over
here we're basically going to do the
best of beauty on a budget for those of
you guys who potentially our Beauty
fanatics but don't have low suspend
we're going to share with you some of
our absolute favorite products and bits
and brands and all that kind of good
stuff to give you some inspiration and
probably get you shopping as well and
then we're gonna have a video on
Amelia's channel which is our style
staples all year round yeah things we
love no matter the season time day
anything you might have seen Amelia on
my channel before we definitely did a
video last year together which was
really good fun and you know she said
look not a local girl sounds so straight
no I local girl but it's nice to have
someone just to come and bribe oh we've
had lunch and everything and it just
makes well this a bit more fun so I hope
you guys enjoy this video so I'll go
first and I'm gonna do when it comes to
basically skincare and the brand that I
really like for skincare and I think
budget is it's kind of relative right
because some people might want to pounds
or 3 pounds and might be like 5 pounds
to 7 pounds but I genuinely think the
body shop are absolutely amazing right
now I'm loving the drops of the youth
range they've got really really good
products in there I love this um cream
which is like a day cream it's really
like moisturizing yeah I want a big
mouth
it doesn't really smell it's fresh it's
quite light and I think that the body
shop in general have got really good
skin care products like vitamin C range
is amazing they've got the white mask
where it's been arranged
amazing as well and it's super
affordable and I think that if you want
to start on skincare the body shop is a
good option to go with it they have such
a wide variety of things as well so much
amazing I've even got their foundation
is what also if anyone's looking for
those shoes yeah I use this they're
fresh news foundations which have got
like color drops as well yeah so you can
make it slightly darker or slightly
lighter so I love the body shop that
kind of
you just eat it too I know I put in too
but they are like one of my favorite
okay I'm gonna cheat as well I have two
foundations from L'Oreal Paris which I
love so I thought I'd like bring two
options because L'Oreal True Match is
one of my favorites when I want like a
dewy really fresh luminous look and
super long-lasting as well and then the
L'Oreal infallible Pro matte foundation
is when I want something like most long
lasting foundation I own it doesn't
oxidize on my skin it doesn't leave like
a too powdery or matte finish either you
do need to spend quite a bit of time
bending out there but yeah it's worth it
so these two are and also the thing of
loyal Paris that some people might not
know is that they've got such a color
range that ya got I think they've got
over 20 shades but sometimes they do
yeah they'll be stocks like in the shops
in my only sell five but if you go
online and I think if you buy it from
L'Oreal directly you can get all the
color ranges some women feel like
they're not included in the spectrum but
they create the product is just that
sometimes you can't find them in store
so just do your research but they're
excellent foundation so next up it is a
right shadow palette and and just I'm
gonna talk about the brands as well so
sleek sleek were one of the brands that
I first started out with when it came to
wearing makeup the wearing eye shadow
and stuff I don't know if you were ever
I really so blush by three the blastia
and the contour yeah amazing like sleek
were absolutely amazing they are
drugstore brand and they were the first
ones to really like the best ones to do
like I don't know a variety of a lovely
of pigmented eyeshadows and this is a
new one I think this one is called I
don't know it's called all night long
this one's called and what you have are
multiple different colors but they've
got palettes that are like super vibrant
like the electric highlight very fun and
they have matte and shimmers as well
matte and shimmer and I think they're
excellent so if you want to get really
nice eyes shadows yeah a nice base here
amazing and the quality is great and
another one that I really like for
eyeshadows is Kiko as well yeah I'm just
gonna keep dropping extra ones a little
bit but I've got favorites from there as
well but I'll show you guys that palette
then okay I'm gonna talk about my
favorite eyeshadow palettes I love sleek
but these are like a recent I'd say like
a year and a half ago discovery from you
or like I've loved sweet pages these are
from collection they're the eyes
uncovered oh my gosh you tried no I
never see like that's so buttery
oh yeah it's ready to paint but the
eyeshadows are so buttery
the shimmers are so beautiful I love
this one it has a matte black in it I
really find it hard to like get yellowed
quality matte blacks a really nice bone
shade as well and then they have they
honestly have so many different types of
I've never seen these so beautiful so
where are these soldiers SuperDrive
boots
I'm a nation that's so good
so I've never seen those before say
thank you that is anyone to add to my
collection
okay next up I'm going to show mascara I
mean I've got loads of favorites when it
comes to drugstore mascaras so I'm going
to show you Maybelline and also L'Oreal
I know I really am sorry
I just I'm looking at them here I'm like
oh I don't know how to choose between
them but um okay I'll go with L'Oreal
first and foremost I think they've got
really good mascara so there's so many
different ones they have but I feel like
everyone they come out with is good and
I found that sometimes these L'Oreal
ones are better than some of the
high-end ones I've had in the past and
we spend 6 pounds or 7 pounds and they
just come out amazing but maybe they
also have this new one their push-up
drama
I bury L'Oreal one today oh yeah oh this
one yeah these are absolutely amazing
and they they last forever so yeah
you're a fan I'm a fan I'm gonna keep
singing the theme these are my favorite
lashes ever yeah Adele Demi Macy's yeah
amazing
so so so good I'm wearing a cut like
half off and I'm wearing like caught
them on the corner today and I just love
them I love way like a full strip you
always the laughs you don't you know I
live for lashes yeah yeah so so so good
and they're really affordable as well so
it depends on where you buy them yeah so
if you buy them from boots I buy them
from boot like three five ninety five
under ten pounds for sure so I have a
secret if you go to certain areas you
can get them for $1.99 a pack so I buy
ten at a time like be good to like
Croydon if you go to Tooting there are
shops that sell these like because
before they became famous right yeah
they were likely to go to lashes and you
can layer them $1.99 and I can like
Vichy don't buy expense don't spend ten
five pounds on those I know
oh yeah they are amazing and definitely
affordable so moving on to the lips I'm
only gonna be good and stick with one
but it's the NYX butter gloss and I
bought this when I was in New York from
this random shop that everyone was
telling me that I should go to where you
can get like my ex and LA girl cuz my
tips and other brands and these are
amazing right their gross is but they're
really pigmented as well and I've got
all these neutrals and all these nudes
and I just throw them on like on days
when I'm not wearing makeup as well and
it just makes me look a little bit
fresher and put together I feel like I'm
moving to goss's right now and as well
like they're like Drita young very oh
yeah they're so so good and I love the
color range at they have in me so yeah
have you got these
and also I have different variations of
shades and one's a tiny whip yeah yeah
yes and how much are they I think one
five five oh five pounds I think they're
super affordable I think I spent it was
seven to nine dollars for those so I was
like yes I can have ten of these please
like amazing I ended up spending so much
money there because I kept buying those
make cheap things and I was like oh but
they are quite sure as well yeah so
they've got what they've got like a nice
skin yeah which I quite like
so yeah it doesn't just look shiny yeah
exactly I am obsessed with lip liner
there's not a day where I wear lipstick
without lip liner and yeah like I am
addicted to the stuff I'm just like over
lining my lips all the time so these are
my favorite - yeah yeah so good
exaggerated lip liners they have so many
new colors I haven't seen the whole kind
of course that's just really creamy they
last really long they put them all over
oh yeah yeah sometimes it depends but
I'm medium on lip liners I go for dark
and it - I can't give myself more shape
but these ones are very good okay so my
final product is I think I've mentioned
this a few times it's the LA girl Pro
concealer I always use Estee Lauder
Double Wear as my concealer it's like my
favorite concealer and then everyone was
asking for like alternatives and stuff
and this was an excellent one that kept
coming up I use a color fawn under my
eyes and to highlight and stuff I don't
know if you've used these before no I've
heard so much about them though I picked
these up in the US it's very easy to
blend them yes but don't let them dry so
the thing is I find that they're a
little bit draggy and they're not as
moist as some other ones but they're
still very very good and actually you
get a lot of coverage like a little can
go a very long way on these so it's very
pigmented and good but I would just keep
moisturized before you um put this on
but this is an excellent affordable
concealer for the guys out there who
can't necessarily afford getting you
know really expensive ones I love this
and you can try lots of different colors
as well and the coverage I think
trade rings yes massive I think there
were 30 colors or something's crazy and
they do other products as well okay this
is my last one
and I honestly have quite a few and this
is so hard like narrowing down to five
but this is my favorite powder ever ever
ever ever it's the Borah healthy balance
powder kind of reminds me if you tried
this chanel a beige if you're interested
in trying it this is a great alternative
for that because it's quite a light
powder it doesn't have a really heavy
coverage it's not cakey I'm someone that
likes to reapply my powder like a
hundred times you don't want to separate
so this is really really good for that
has a nice mirror in there as well and
it's Sophie yeah I never really buy
anything from beaugeois but I'll have a
look I've seen that so guys that is the
end of our budget Beauty favorites I
