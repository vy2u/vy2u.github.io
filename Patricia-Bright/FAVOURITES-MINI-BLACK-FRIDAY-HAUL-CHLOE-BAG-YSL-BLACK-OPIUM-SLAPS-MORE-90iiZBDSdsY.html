have a favorite and it's kind of got a
mini haul in it as well obviously it's
been Black Friday and Cyber weekend so I
actually had already shot this but I had
some issues of my fire and I was inside
okay fine I'm gonna reshoot this and
then put all the extra things that I've
got in at this video with you it's not
like there's absolutely loads and loads
of stuff because I don't really do huge
hauls anymore but I've got some really
nice stuff included then this dress to
show you and obviously none of my ever
changing finger and all that kind of
good stuff and kind of trying to change
things up but still maintain my like you
know my individuality my sexiness my
Flair and all that kind of good stuff so
I am very excited because I've got some
good news to share with you so get
comfortable and get a cup of tea like I
always say and I hope you guys enjoy the
first favorites I have has got to be my
slaps now a slap is basically a satin
lined hat now if you are like me you
might wrap your hair at night or you
might wear a scarf at night and
sometimes you might look like the lady
who's going to the laundry but you know
usually I crack my hair at night because
I love to keep my hair moisturize I
don't want to have any damage on it I
don't want it to rub against the pillow
and sometimes I'm trying to maintain my
hair style especially who I've got my
hair extensions in and even my natural
hair as well but basically this these
slaps satin blind hats had got satin on
the inside of the Hat and basically you
wear it to bed at night to one keep your
hair from you know drying out keeping
the moisture that you have in maintain
the hairstyle and just keeping
everything contained at night and what I
absolutely love about these is one they
don't get too hot too they do not go off
at night like you know what the
old-school head scarves I like sometimes
they might end up all the way over there
and you're here like what why is your
head and scarf in a completely different
location that happens to me all the time
because I am definitely a rough sleeper
I don't know if you're like that but I
see all kinds of angles but this Jen
when he stays on at night and also I
found that I sneaked these hats on in
like the minimum of the day like I'd
only put it on so that you've got a
minute to hair cell going on right and
also like it's the postman comes to the
door I don't want him to see me in my
head rap you know Ernie my man gets to
see those special occasions so I put on
the Hat and it's really really good
I would genuinely advise checking these
guys out because there are really good
products and I don't understand why no
one's thought of this before after that
it's got to be wire cells black opium I
don't think this is a new perfume but
this is the perfume that is new in my
life and it will remain in my life if
this perfume is literally like so sexy
eventually it's just sexy it's like warm
and rich and sultry and just get your
shoulder like shake it thinking about
Christmas presents this perfume smells
absolutely divine
it's very opulent a very feminine and I
don't know why I didn't know about this
and then when I googled it I realized
that other people were using it all the
time and I think like I don't think it's
not new but like people love it and I
can see why it's definitely worth
picking up it smells delicious
if I keep mentioning my ever-changing
freak figure pregnancy is really real
and my boobs have got huge they are so
big and so heavy and I'm like girls and
what is going on so I am living in a
sports bra this isn't my Nike dri-fit
sports bra and you can see it's racing
back but I'm not gonna lie to you I'm
wearing this at night I'm wearing this
at day and when it needs to work out I
wearing this the cord out wearing this
everywhere and I'm finding that having a
support bra is essential for me and you
know sometimes if your boobs hurt
because they're quite heavy and I was
getting a lot of booty pain which
obviously happens a lot but I found that
when I was wearing my support bra
regularly if my boobs didn't hurt as
much
and if anything like the sensitivity has
reduced I thought that just wait
that really does cause sensitivity so
it's really important to wear a really
good supporting bra specially if you
just have bigger boobs
in general this has been a lifesaver
there's no answer way up but it feels
like an underwire bar because it's so so
so supporting is it like padding in it
but it just makes you feel so snug this
is such a great bra like put this on I
was like yeah hello it gives me really
nice cleavage as well after that it's
got to be the new color pop collection
from my girl it's my rain break
she is collaborating with the guys at
color pop and I didn't have color pop
here in the UK but the guys emailed me
and turn it over to me and I absolutely
love it this is what I'm wearing on my
lips now there's a 9r there's a lipstick
and it's girls
I've already a matte gloss I've already
lost the lid of this because I clearly
been using it a lot and then this I were
combined I think it's absolutely amazing
and I'm not just saying that because I
am friends with rain but I just think
it's really good and you guys know she's
like queen of lippies and Nick products
and these are very affordable and they
look great and they last all day well
done it's a really really really good
formulation like unbelievably is working
for something that so you know low in
price I was like oh hello my next
favorites have to be these products from
Mourad and it's the oil control
mattifier and the time-release pens are
now I don't know if you guys now I've
had a facial with me right in the past
and I remember like coming out of that
facial and looks really good my skin was
glowing and then I got these products
because I've obviously been having you
know breakups in my skin is clear ah
thank you I know those of you guys have
noticed that hormones have a lot to do
that but when I do have breakouts
they're more like quite they're a bit
more like intense breakouts and that's
like one or two really big spots like in
the middle of my head or on the side of
this cheek all the time I always get
those but I've been using this blemish
cleanser I really like it it really does
make
of space for kind of tingly and clean
and I'm also loving the oil control
mattifier SPF and what I like about this
is that it I don't know if it's a
moisture I think I need to moisturize oh
no it is it moisturizes and protects I
use SPF all year round but I find that
this is a really good primer before I
put my makeup on as well because it
really does keep me nice and matte
sticking with product it's also got to
be Palmer's cocoa butter cocoa butter
smells so good I especially like a man
who uses his cocoa butter I'm not even
gonna lie to you this smells so
delicious and again I mentioned in my
last video that I had been suffering
from eczema I've been suffering from
extremely dry and itchy skin right so
many things happen with your hormones so
things change and like all my neck was
that had like a dry rash I had it all on
my arms as well it was very very intense
and very very light I don't know what
it's like when you have intense X my
used to have it as a kid but imagine
constantly feeling itchy it's very
uncomfortable I basically put in a
routine of intense moisturization I use
some medical products like kool-aid him
and stuff but um I actually have really
been using the Palmers collection the
tummy butter which is great for stretch
marks and also the therapy oil it's the
spray which is great when you just have
your ashy moments like between your
hands I don't know whether a spray-on
like oil has been all my life but I just
use it to seal everything in so my next
two favorites are non beauty or product
related number one is a show called last
Kingdom oh my gosh I don't know if you
have been watching it the BBC has done
so well so well with this series if you
watched Game of Thrones and you loved it
you're not this if you love Pillars of
the Earth you'd love this if you love a
bit of a historical drama bit of
masculine abyss sex a little bit you
know a little bit of that kind of stuff
you guys have this
this and it's actually based on when the
Dutch in were invading the Brits and the
Saxons and the Britain isn't that kind
of good stuff and it's just so good like
I was so happy to stumble across this
series and I've watched everything I
just couldn't believe how good it's been
going forward I'm gonna always highlight
the tracks that I use in a video
especially if it's in their favorite
this track is called drive by Alex
Maxwell and it's a really really good
track with a really good vibe and I'm
all about finding music that you
wouldn't necessarily find on the
mainstream radio or that you know you
finally YouTube and you're like wow this
song is really good the guys sent this
over to me and I might check out this
song and I was like I love it thank you
so much for sending it to me I'm putting
it in this video and if I can highlight
you know music that I'm finding I'm
listening to I know lots of creators and
people are just looking for new things
to listen to so this song is absolutely
amazing and I will link it in the
description bar below so you guys can
check out the video just send some love
and support and hopefully if you guys
also have tracks as well do send them on
to me I really love just finding new
things and finding new music that sounds
really good like this one so for this
part I am combining and my horn and my
favorite and the first thing I want to
show you you guys would have seen this
last week is my suede jacket from
exhaust
so it's this jacket here which you guys
thought on me last week it was so
popular on my social media this jacket
was absolutely gorgeous I love it I saw
it on the site it kind of reminds me of
them RJ jacket and that was just perfect
for me I know it's getting cold but
usually I Drive a lot or I would jump
from the inside a scarf and skinny jeans
and personal boots to keep me nice and
warm but this is that menu everyday
jacket any of this perhaps that I know
what I'm gonna put in the description
bar below is also doing discounts or
cyber weekend so on misguided so I put
little things so ah nice and and
Jennings so many guys so if you want to
buy something all right I'll put it in
this video you should get shopping after
that I just picked up two bits from
misguided number one is this Baby Doe
dress and hopefully I'll stand up or
take a picture so you guys can see what
it looks like but it's got this kind of
mesh floor or wee bit that's just on
here and I think it's really really cute
I just went with the strapless bar I
really think this is so nice and then it
comes out at the bottom at the moment
I'm not liking anything that clings too
much to my middle region because the
funny thing is that I don't look that
big but I don't look that small so it's
a bit like is she bloated or is she
carrying a child it's the latter so this
is this gorgeous gorgeous baby don't
dress and then love the I'm really
hoping you're gonna be able to see this
after I've got this one-piece top here
it is white we've like mesh and holes in
it and I think it was just a really nice
classic piece now I'm gonna have a vest
or maybe a big bikini underneath because
I am going to Barbados on holiday so
I've been picking up nice things that
are gonna make me feel great while I am
away and I just feel like this is gonna
be a perfect piece it does have a hole
in the back area or a thing that's nice
to give me some extra stretch I don't
know how I've left this so long it's got
to be my Chloe but and yes this is a
designer bag yes this isn't bit more of
a pricey bag I'm not expecting anyone to
go out and buy a bag that looks like
this
however Christmas time is coming so if
you did want inspiration or the way I'm
gonna be doing a gift guide and this is
gonna be in the gift guide because I
think this is amazing yet but my
climbing bag is something that I'm a
really really excited about now the last
time I've been looking for really
comfortable but nice flat shoes that
don't just look really ugly I picked up
these I know these are gonna be hit or
miss with some people but I love these
okay my last I bought the pointy red
ones and my
just dissing me and you guys dissed me
so I kind of actually took them back but
I picked these up as an alternative and
I really like them and I've warned them
now so they're not going anywhere
I locked the leopard print and I love
the tassel on them I just think it's
really cute and they're very comfortable
frankly I don't know how well you're
gonna be able to see this but this is a
white dress which is from pretty little
things it's got really nice kind of mesh
detailing on it it's floral and it's a
really comfortable fit at the moment
Comfort it's like a hundred percent
important to me so I'm really focusing
on wearing things that make me feel good
when I am wearing them and aren't too
clingy so guys that is my favorites
video for you of all so I've got all the
details for discounts and links in my
description bar below so make sure you
guys you know have a good peek over
there and happy shopping I will catch
