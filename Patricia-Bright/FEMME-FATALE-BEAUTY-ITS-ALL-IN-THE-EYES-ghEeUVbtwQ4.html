you I have been feeling super feminine
and gorgeous with my change of look and
you guys have noticed when you makeup so
I'm finally going to share that with you
there's also an amazing competition that
I'm part of so I'm gonna tell you all
about that at the end so stay tuned now
before I even think about putting on
makeup I always try to get the face and
the canvas looking right which means no
stray hairs and these eyebrows and my
top lip are looking a little bit from so
I am using the facial precision wax care
from vite which I love basically you use
hot water put the wax in it heats up
after about two minutes and there is a
precision applicator to basically use on
those tricky areas and honestly it
doesn't hurt as much as it looks like it
hurt and have that kind of satisfied
feeling at the end of it after that I go
ahead and wash my face and then I apply
step two which is actually the aftercare
creme which is great to keep my skin sue
after it's been waxed and make sure
there's no redness how keeping in line
when having a great base I go ahead and
moisturize my face gently and obviously
there's no room for dry lips now for
foundation I found that I actually love
using my hands to basically apply it it
gives me a really smooth and natural
finish now for my love of this whole
femme fatale look I know it's all about
framing your face with your eyes and I
think the brows are the first place to
start with it that's why they need a
good wax to make sure everything's in
place and I basically just use a brow
powder and I conceal under my eyes to
give me some extra brightness now that
I'm wearing a fringe I find that I just
really need to
attract light to that kind of top area
of my face for my eyes I keep it simple
and I basically stick to two colors
matte beige on my lid and for the moment
I'm going for my combos in my crease but
I often use a dark brown as well I just
think these are such feminine and sexy
colors to use now I totally go on
overkill on the eyeliner as much as I
hate doing eyeliner because it makes my
eyes water but I find that a little
winged eyeliner just gives your eyes
that most attractive look especially
with some flirting lashes and then go
ahead and blend everything in just so
that my face looks flawless and I'm
loving highlighting again I think it
just attracts more light to my eyes and
just gives my fat head a little bit more
shape I use my contour as well for
shaping and defining totally femme
fatale right
guys I need to let you know that I'm
obsessed with lipliner I feel like that
I had really shapeless lips but you can
create so much definition and shape and
make lips look so sexy I love using a
dark lip liner and a bright pink on the
inside I find it gives me gorgeous
feminine and shaking lips I love it
finally I just like to put my hair up
and brush this fringe down to really
make the eyes pop but guys that's
basically my look I think it is a very
feminine and gorgeous and it's so easy
to do I wanted to let you know about an
absolutely amazing opportunity guys and
it is the beat and it's all about
feelings and fit-outs hence the look and
you guys will have an opportunity to win
a trip to guess where oh yeah show that
