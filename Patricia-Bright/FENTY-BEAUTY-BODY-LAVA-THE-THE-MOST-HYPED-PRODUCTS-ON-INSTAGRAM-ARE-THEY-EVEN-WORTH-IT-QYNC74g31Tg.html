today's video is about I've kind of been
like on a like a make up the height

of hype around to make up at the moment
so I wanted to try something like the
most hyped makeup especially on
Instagram and give you guys my first
impressions full face trying it out I've
got some other fancy Beauty goodies as
well as Anastasio darling some brett
moon rocks and just a full face of
everything new and i want to share with
you what i think about these and the
funny thing is i know that i have
followers who are like I'm not really
into makeup and stuff like that listen
babe alright let me tell you something
and I was never makeup artist like I was
wearing Vaseline until the age of 21
okay I was like Vaseline and goes I'm
not makeup lace I just like to look good
you know that's what it's about
alright in everyday go he's like what
can I use what's gonna look good on me
and then I like to share with you guys
if that's what it is I'm not out here
trying to give you lot Pro tips
no we need makeup we need to look good
we need to go
that is what Patricia is about so for
those of you who are on that don't worry
if you're not a makeup aficionado that's
fine just get comfortable get a cup of
tea and let's just get into this video
so first except obviously we have to get
into the Fenty beauty goodies I'm not
gonna lie I was excited I've seen
Rihanna oiling herself up she's been
glistening like the sunshine
she'd been getting up for
so I'm everyday rubbing that showed off
her Andhra dude the most I said okay
well here we go
so in the connection I believe this is
the whole Beach collection there is the
body lava there is the face and body
kabuki brush and then there is also a
shimmer puff like we're bringing it back
to the classics which I quite like let's
not let's be both the packaging itself
is dying like it's so so amazing you
know fence here you don't miss around I
mean my initial thoughts on the product
is do we really need it like let's be
world do you really need it but it is
fenty and it is Rihanna so yes also I
realize first of all season has come in
summers come in let's not be ashy let's
always be moist so I get it oh my that
is the biggest problem I've ever seen is
this stuff already on the path no is it
you know what the puff has something on
it not much but it already has something
on it oh okay my first impression is
this puff is so gorgeous do you even
want to use it this is more like for
decoration and actual use salmon oh this
is the main goodie this is a really big
bottle who needs clothes yes I agree
okay this is the body lover this shape
is good who needs clothes do you just
see that iridescent nurse and then oh my
gosh is soft and soberness
I'm not gonna lie the Fenty beauty
brushes are some of my regular everyday
go to brushes the foundation brush is
flawless and also the highlight brush is
very ingenious and works really well so
I have a feat on this is really really
nice it's really dense and a really soft
this is gorgeous so I'm just gonna go
ahead and just you know my shoulders
sure my clever cook you know I always
say if you don't have boobies
you always have clavicle listen this is
all the cleavage you need oh no that's
pretty Wow
smells really nice is what smells really
nice okay okay can you guys see that
okay I just wanted to bring you guys in
a little closer just just look at that
gorgeousness the gorgeousness the Kabuki
is delivering the product itself is
delivering and it isn't just the
lighting and bearing in mind that I'm
often an ashy girl like I can't lie my
skin is quite dry so stuff like this is
nice this isn't a greasy oil is works
more like a dry oil that is a she's
gonna sing this song God why does we
wanna keep doing this to me like come on
that is nice it's a really nice product
it works really really well I mean the
pump itself to me it's a give or take
but it's pretty and if you're becoming a
bit of a collector then go ahead but the
Kabuki brush yes the body lava yes it's
really a yes I like that
the puppies just for decoration thank
you
okay next onto my face I'm gonna go in
with this this is like calling my name
this is from Becca I'll be honest I
don't use a lot of Becca I have of
course you champagne pot and one of the
other blushes and highlighters they
basically sent me a whole PR box use the
foundation absolutely love the
foundation really really good and then
this is a shimmering skin perfecter the
shade is topaz and it's like a cream
that I can use as a makeup base so I'm
going to use this as my makeup base I
really do like the packaging I love when
a brand uses Brown not a lot of brands
to use that dark brown and chocolate in
their packaging and I find it to be such
an elegant thing this is so cute
let's use this on
it's really gold but it's weird it's
like a gold that's my skintone okay if I
was gold this is the color I would be I
would even mind being gold and this is
just I can have a more illuminated
finish okay nice it's not actually that
like okay if you build it up it's quite
gold you can wear this like I mean my
skin is relatively clear it's not the
most even skin but like if I just wanted
like illuminated look this would be
actually look slightly like a statue
like a bronze statue as a base it feels
really nice on it is illuminating
without having like the gold flecks in
it I'm gonna go ahead and fill in my
brows with my favorite my benefit
precisely in my brow since I've had my
micro blade in this is not become my
favorite so I always use goof proof from
benefit but now I'm using precisely
because I don't know I feel like it
gives me really nice individual straight
looking brows now this one I've seen
everywhere if you haven't seen this I
don't know where you've been it's on
Instagram I've seen it in people's
videos and this is from Beauty bakery
which is an American brand and I'm not
gonna lie I think it's so so so cute I
think they come up with like foundations
but they also have powders which I've
always tried to buy on beautybay I can
never get it can never get it always
sold out the one I want is always sold
out it's really really annoying I cannot
wait to go to the state I'm going to
shop for all the brands I could just
never get when I'm here in England the
packaging for this is so ingenious cake
mix Demi matte foundation there's got
like directions on the back as well
they've got a bacon oil flour blend in
egg and bakeware oh come on
so creative look at this though how cute
is this like is the little egg box and
the sponges the makeup sponges are in
here okay right anyway let's go in let's
try these foundations
that's a cute shade number 17 number 11
whoo okay free very different this is
more yellow this is really neutral and
then this is more red actually feel like
I'm going to mix two of them together
because I think I need to go a little
bit darker of your nice on first
impression I don't like this sponge I
don't know it's a bit hard it's not it's
not my users but in all honesty the
sponge wasn't my favorite but the
foundation is quite nice I like the way
it's going on it's nice coverage so wait
it's okay it's actually very matte it's
dried in really mad what I will say is
that it kind of oxidizes and goes a
little red up that's what I've just
noticed like it's going a little bit red
on me
am I going slightly and palapa
I actually feel like I am it looks a bit
strange but let's let's let's see what
we can do but the finish of the
foundation is beautiful sake Matt and
like like it wouldn't transfer okay so
next I have the bare minerals the new
bear Pro concealers listen Instagram has
been selling me these I feel like
Instagram must be selling me everything
I keep seeing it everywhere I've
received emails about it whenever I go
on Instagram I see something about it
this is the bareMinerals bear Pro
concealers and it's 16 hour wear full
coverage crease proof waterproof it's a
lot of claims oh okay
dark neutral that's that's actually an
okay shade it's very matte and looks
like it does it this isn't moving me
tell you that for free it doesn't dry
down quickly I want to say it's drying
down quickly but it doesn't want to move
it doesn't want to budge at all this
concealer that's kind of a good thing
this concealer doesn't need baking as
well it's not the kind of concealer that
means baking there ain't going anywhere
me I like
applicator of the consumer it's handy
it's dandy it doesn't move it isn't
gonna Niek everywhere I do like that and
it looks pretty on it's nice I wonder if
the crease proof nurse works so I feel
like I have to use the beauty bakery
setting powders so there's translucent
and there's yellow I'm gonna use the
yellow because I like yellow it's yellow
but it's not like it's not that yellow
I've used yellow ah
for sure I like the way that finished I
like the way that finished that's really
nice have you seen people setting their
eyebrows I saw this on Instagram and I
said bit like why are we doing this but
I get it because that she sometimes
around your brows can look super shiny
so we're just gonna say I brows right
now because Instagram told me to I feel
like it's given me a snatch arul snatch
of roll so this is very popular I'm a
little bit late on it but it is the
Anastasia soft glam is it me or do I
feel like I said that but I feel like
it's not getting as much hype or
Anastasia Beverly Hills isn't getting as
much height as it used to get but it's
just so pretty I'm gonna go in with
orange soda this orange is definitely
not looking like an orange to me it
might be due to my chocolate skin this
is no there is no orange here honey but
it's a really nice little base I'm just
gonna go in with a soft orange as well
okay we're getting a bit more from soft
orange I mean overall to be honest the
colors don't speak to me that that much
of the Maria palette which I absolutely
love and a few others but this palette
doesn't really speak to me okay I've
just gone in with Sienna
Sienna's give me some pups
I'm using some of this sultry right
there which is really nice I thought I
would need to wet my brush but I didn't
it's sitting on my lid nice City
Beautiful gotta say that those
eyeshadows just pulled me back in to
really being interested in this palette
cuz for a second there was a bit like
meow has made your room bit bored but
that just pulled me back in nicely I
just love the way that goes on my lids
hmm okay okay we're gonna put some
mascara on I haven't used this before
this is the top lights camera lashes
mascara I've used some of that other
mascaras before but not this one I've
been using the benefit bad girl bang
since it came out
however I really use any others besides
the L'Oreal parrot paradise mascara so
yeah okay my baby lashes are still
looking kind of weedy the thing is that
if you like me I don't have a lot of
lash you know I just wasn't gifted in
the lash department and so I feel like I
need more it's not it's not giving me
much I just want to show you in
comparison to when I use my bad girl
bang like that you should can see a huge
difference and it's not just that that
would lay it like this is what it does
okay yes we have the Brethren rocks babe
in Paradise this is his highlighter I
was gonna say quad but actually it's got
six different highlighters which is a
lot oh it's oh it's creamy its creamy
yeah the box have a fan brush I didn't
even realize that I love that I didn't
expect a little brush it's actually
quite chunky came with a brush shady
bitch I'm gonna use shady bitch the
names are very Redmond that's nice
that's really gold
I'd love in the brush I'm loving the
brush son fan brush can give you like a
line like it's like they're just that
where's this is kind of diffusing and
spreading it my eye like it's popping
that's really nice
down my yet nose I'm going to use
vacation yes okay nice very nice I love
the color of that is it's gorgeous I
mean my mother my I'm at the stage that
like highlighters highlight enough
actually no that's not true because some
are really chunky and glittery and
they're just but this is a soft it's
move it's rich in color we like it time
to get rid of some of this of baked it
came off so nicely but only things I
feel a bit dry
let recently I've been liking a more
like moisturized like chewy look you
know just more luscious in the skin but
I feel a bit sandy next I'm gonna try it
a little something from NARS
this is Hot Tin Roof liquid blush I
don't really wear brush as much as I
used to and I've never ever ever tried
lick Oh God oh okay a little goes a long
ways and let's all go the long way
Oh God I thought that that was just
gonna be you know really liquidy a flow
is gonna be a bit like a tent but you
know like glossy a cloud pain I also
thought it would like mess up my
foundation underneath but it just went
just into my skin I mean yeah okay what
you're gonna have to do Patricia is just
be gentle don't go to Han this is
amazing this is for those of you are
like inner ass and you just want to like
be like put some blush on and go but a
little goes a long way I love that blush
I love the way you apply it and I love
the way it finish it okay so with
lippies I feel like there's new lippies
all the time what I wanted to try it was
these from NYX these are basically a
powder lippy I know exciting right a
power of the lipid and I think I saw
maybe nikkietutorials doing a video on
this Oh powder puff lippy I love the
packaging oh just a flash look okay
let's see I'm squeezing
and squeezing I love it
are you crazy I don't know what that
looks like on camera it looks a little
bit at City but this is reminding me of
Patricia like circle 2011 12 like when I
thought I was like I don't know I used
to have a lot of like pink lipstick
and something I was a doll I really like
that though it's so soft and so pretty
okay
let me try a slightly darker shade like
on the outside I don't even have the
word liner with that or do I don't look
um well love the way you guys squeeze it
and then the color comes in and I don't
know what it is but I love love love the
application of that and I love the way
it looks and I haven't put on a lip
liner which for me is extremely
extremely extremely rare because the way
my lips are shaped like lip liner
usually helps you know put some
definition in but I'm gonna tell you
right now what this image looks like is
not anything like what the product looks
like I feel like I know innocent like
like innocence maybe on my shoulders
shining as well I need to dirty put some
of that on my hands cuz they look like
sand I feel like everything came
together really well right I'm going to
finish off with a makeup setting spray
from YSL top secret I actually use the
primer so I'm gonna try this out now
what we're not gonna do is spray
directly onto my face because I have a
video where I once did a beautiful like
full face and I put on a finishing spray
that I had never used before
why why what why
I look like I've got white freckles I'm
really pissed and it just ruined ruin
the whole look so what we're gonna do is
just spray on my hand first and just
check that is my tip to you never spray
something you've never sprayed from
before directly to your face oh I like
that that has just brought back some
life and some moisture to my face making
my skin look a bit more skin Mike I just
love the way my body is glistening like
these sun like rays of sun pill oh my
gosh no I'm I'm feeling this what'd you
guys think
I mean I didn't like the fact that he
looked a bit dryer before but with a
little bit of a really nice setting
spray I'm good this is a really nice
look the goodies here were nice
definitely if you were interested in
trying I would go ahead I'll just
exercise a bit of caution with the
foundation and the concealer if you have
drier skin but if you are oily that is
going to settle in nicely and actually I
know I complained about it being a bit
red but as you can see all together I
feel like it looks really really really
good I'm not mad I'm not mad at that
people I can't lie the way that the body
lava is just okay guys that is it for me
a full face of first impressions or some
majorly popular goodies what do you guys
think again as I say I'm not makeup
artist I'm just an everyday go who just
likes to make herself look good and I
know a lot of you guys are like not
makeup pros or anything but you want to
know what the tears so hopefully I
delivered that in the meantime I will
cut you soon bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
