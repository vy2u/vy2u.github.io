tutorial and as you can see I'm super
excited because I'm up to my first
festival ever
I am off to Glastonbury and this is my
love child look that I wanted to share
with you guys I hope you enjoy so to
start off with I always look crazy but
I'm gonna put my base and my brows on
and I'm just going to show you the eyes
and the lips so I'm gonna start off with
this amazing products from Revlon it's
for color stain and basically it's the
quad of golds and browns if you're super
simple like me this is the corner of all
quads I put gold on my lid I put a
little bit of gold in my tear duct and
brown in my crease I know that I want to
keep my vids looking super simple but at
least done now the thing I really want
to stand out is a my liquid liner and I
am using this liner it is amazing it
gives me such good position but as you
can see I'm taking my time to do this
properly and I'm doing my winged liner a
little bit thicker than usual I think it
just gives me that festival glam
the next I'm gonna use the 3d volume
mascara and I always do my mascara going
downwards because I have really curly
lashes and they always look really short
I don't know if you guys have any tips
for me but I do find that this gives me
really nice for you and definitely
stretches them out and as you can see I
made a little error there but I kind of
liked it so my new thing is basically
layering my lip balms
I love these matte lip balms from Revlon
and I use the colorful shameless
basically on the outside like an ombre
lip and it just gives my lips such a
nice shape and then I use of color for
showing on the inside and it's gonna go
back to D effect which I actually love
finally I'm just going to add a splash
of color by adding a bit of blush which
is in a color called why not which kind
of goes with my pink things for the
lovechild look and that's basically it
so my hair is looking all kinds of crazy
and I know when I'm at a festival it
probably will look crazy
there's not going to be much access to
showers so this has been my favorite
trick of late which is basically doing a
braid across the front to kind of just
make it look like the messy look is what
I was going for and I just kind of braid
it across brush it forward and braid it
down and as you can see my brain really
isn't that neat but you know I really
like this look so guys that is me
festive already all of the items that
I've used I'm going to put in the
description bar below so make sure you
check it out as you can see I'm ready to
get my dance on so hopefully when I am
at the festival I will vlog there and
show you guys what I get up to but I
hoped you enjoyed and thumbs up if you
want to see a bit more beauty because
I'm getting a lot more confident do
but I will see you guys later in my next
video bye
love you all
by the time when our 360 pounded us in a
week that's a hundred and fifty pounds
you'll spend a one feel coming on the
other</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
