video is going to be a wedding update
video as you guys are up to find out
what's going on and where I am with
things that I quite like doing these are
intermittently because it reminds me
where I'm at so as it currently stands
I'll be getting married in ten weeks
from now and it's unbelievable I don't
know where I'm gonna upload this video
so it could be even less than that so
I'm gonna be getting married at the end
of March the last week of March and then
I'll be flying out to Mauritius so it is
really creeping us up on us really
really quickly and I'm really excited
about it for those of you who've asked
me and Mike don't live together we
haven't lived together but he does come
to my house on the weekend and it's a
little bit difficult just managing our
time tables but it's better than being
long-distance which you were for a very
very long time so as it stands we've got
the venue booked I've got the caterer
booked I've got the equipment and stuff
like that cookbook and you guys would
not believe things like linen plates and
knives and all that kind of stuff that
cost like a thousand pounds it was it's
shocking to see how much of weddings
cost it was ridiculous but that's all
sorted out I've sorted out we've got the
groom suit and we've got the groom's
winces they're gonna look absolutely
stunningly gorgeous they're wearing
these beautiful we're going for the
really traditional kind of English thing
with it they've got tails but no top
hats and they're just gonna look
gorgeous for their cuts and everything
like lovely lovely lovely lovely and
might look gorgeous in his groom sit
very handsome dashing young man and what
else have we got the bridesmaids dresses
have come back in so we obviously we get
they got made so made to order so
they've just arrived back and we will be
doing it girls a bridesmaids fitting
just to make sure everything's right and
my other dress has come back so my
second dress I'll be wearing for the
wedding has come back that's amazing if
you guys want to see you won't be seeing
my dress but if you want to see my the
bridesmaid girl dresses just leave
and thumbs up is all like and then I
will just go and film when we go and do
the trial and with the bridle the bridle
guards and stuff like that that could be
fun actually
so we've booked the honeymoon which you
guys know we've got a photographer yes
we got a photographer
we got dog fur so I should do one little
dance but I have and but we've got the
photographer
and I'm going to be doing an engagement
shoot which is a that's a bit weird like
this whole engagement shoot thing but it
should be fun just to try it out so I'll
do the engagement shoot again if you
would like to I have a see footage from
it or see the pictures from it actually
you probably would then leave a comment
and stuff like that below as well what
else is there my dress needs to be
adjusted so it's not being completely
adjusted but that's fine food the menu
we've not decided on the menu I cannot
decide between either having a seated
dinner with a fixed menu or a buffet and
in my opinion people like a greater
variety versus just you know sit down
and you have this it's either meet this
chef fish dish or vegetarian dish but
it's an easy way to kind of do things
but I don't know I just want like loads
and loads of food there I've got my
invitations done I've send up sent out
my invitations to most people I've got
my friends the girls who I interned with
well girls who I went to training with
in New York who are coming down to
London and one of the guys as well so
that's just amazing to have like people
who I love being there that's it cake is
sorted out that's best I'd know what I
have um no one game so that should be
sorted out I do need to organize the
next steps but that's all been sorted
out I did have a quote for flowers and
the quote for flowers was like whoa but
I know that flowers cost a lot of money
but for me I'm gonna have to do
something different and I'm gonna have
to get creative and go to a florist
myself and try and start putting some
bouquets ago because I know what flowers
I want it's called a chrysanthemum bloom
so yes I'm gonna do that and sort that
out myself probably or with the
bridesmaids and
so don't have my centerpiece decorations
yet so I don't know if I want to go to
four can candelabras they're really big
things with the candles in them I might
go for that if not I might go for some
something that's got to do with lights
and stuff like that and I don't talk too
much about it boys and girls you know we
have to get married first and yeah that
is it whoa that's a lot done but you
guys have been asking me you know how's
it going things are moving really really
well thank God that I kind of started
addressing them quite early so I don't
feel too stressed about it now and
because I'm working in everything and
trying to combine the two it's quite
difficult to kind of wedding plan and
work at the same time but more most of
it is done I'm wondering if there's
anything I've missed out my video up
there isn't you guys will remind me if I
have missed something out
oh yeah actually we haven't sorted out
our music and our deejay and our order
or service yet and it's so weird because
like if you think about it you know
we're quite a young couple and
everything and like we from both
different cultures so you know he's got
we've got people from his side who are
90 years old who are in World War 2 you
know I mean like really lovely lovely
people
these are very that's nice and then
you've got you know apps as in Nigerians
from the village who want to hear
talking drums and you I don't you guys
won't know but you know they're just
gonna want this kind of dramatic Oh big
parade big I don't know if you're not
spraying it but there'll be a lot of
spraying lots of money like being poor
Dave and people just like hey we got
what is this so we're trying to work out
with the DJ what kind of music we're
gonna have because some people when I
listen to afro beats somebody whoop some
people want to listen to 70s classic
some people want to listen to some
French too much what some people want to
listen to I don't know like it's just
that's the issues I need a DJ who can
understand the combination of cultural
differences and
age differences because you got from 90
year old to 13 year olds so you could
have a bit of Justin Bieber on that end
and then we gonna have a bit of Frank
Sinatra on that end
whoops so that's the next step and also
what music I'm gonna play down that but
we've got we know our first dance but
this is it's been our song for four
years so we always knew you're gonna do
a first not to this song but we may have
to get a bit of training you know cuz my
cousin is I'm not that good but yeah
what's up very excited to tell you guys
all about it a bit later on but that is
my wedding update and I keep you in the
loop if you want to hear any more you
know just leave comments of anything
else that you have wanna know about and
like and I'll see you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
