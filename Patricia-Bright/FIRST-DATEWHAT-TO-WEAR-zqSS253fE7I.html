first date outfit and I know there are
so many girls I'm like what should I
wear I'm going up this guy you may not
know them that well or you might know
him really well so you don't want to
look like you're trying too hard and
there's so many decisions and the last
thing you want to worry about on the
first day is your outfit and you know
how uncomfortable you're feeling in it
so I thought I'd give you three
different ideas depending on three
different situations and ask for is
actually jeans and a t-shirt and I think
a great way to look on a date is really
casual but like sheep and sophisticated
at the same time so skinny jeans as well
as some high-heeled boots I think will
put you in a great position where you
feel really comfortable with yourself
that you don't look like really slouchy
and rubbish but you're feeling like yeah
I look good but I don't look like I've
tried too hard and I think that's what a
jeans and t-shirt gives you
the second outfit is if you want to
basically look a bit more dressed up or
you want to get your legs out wear a
skirt I love Scott looks most of the
time to be totally honest and I do love
short skirts because of my figure so I
feel that these are absolutely fine to
wear in the first day but I would
definitely you know where some tights
and cover up on the top and make me not
wear such a really fitted tight body con
skirt maybe something a bit more a line
and a bit more flirty and fun
the funding if you find that you're
going out and like a really nice dinner
day or to an event or something where
you need to get a bit more dressed up
definitely go for the dress and you can
definitely choose a black dress for me I
would probably go in color because I
like to shine but you know for me it's
all about drape and just looking really
elegant on that first kind of date
I hope that gave you a few different
ideas on things you can wear on a first
date and fingers crossed that everything
goes well if you've got any other
scenarios that they'd love to work out
what outfit could you air for then leave
a comment below I'm hoping on doing a
few more videos like this I'm like
meeting his parents or first job or
interview or something like that so
leave comments below and I will get
these rolling that's watching guys make
sure you like and subscribe as well bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
