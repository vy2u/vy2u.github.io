video and almost like a combination of
what I got for Christmas as well not but
I have very much to show you because the
lot of it is like more house staff and I
got things like rice cookers and things
like that and like lots of money and
stuff like that but I got loads of home
decor stuff so I really hope you don't
mind I'll get all the fashion stuff done
first
fashion and beauty first and then I'll
show you guys the home decor stuff as
well but I've got loads to show you so
I'll get started almost forgot I did do
that get Christmas gift ideas for girls
and there are few things I said that
people could have so in the bottom bar I
have left the names of the winners so
the first thing I want to show you is
these boots that I've got and they look
to mungus they're not that humongous I'm
not showing like them because you guys
know I've got this foot complex thing
and my feet are massive then they know
they're massive for my height my feet
massive I'm a size 8 basically and these
make them look really good they're like
Chelsea boots and I've been looking for
Chelsea boots for ages but every Chelsea
boot I ever find makes me look like a
boat for literally it's just so long so
I have to get one of the heel but this
has got a really chunky heel and a
really chunky platform they look
fabulous on and I've been wearing the
DEF at them already and these were from
office but the office in Topshop look
long side that I bought another pair of
leather trousers and I have this issue
with leather trousers I often but I've
had like two pairs in the past but they
always split on me
I found that I don't know why they split
but they always play so this is the
Topshop pair which are kind of a
snakeskin and they're in a size 10 but I
found them to be a bit funny here and
there when it comes to like sizing and
stuff but I really like them because
they're skinny and I love the texture on
them so I'm hoping these don't fail me
like this
I bought this MIDI it's like a midi
skirt and it's a really fitted one I put
in the size 8 but it's actually in tall
so it comes to really awkward length by
quite like the nips that comes to this
actually like a teal green which looks
quite blue and camera no idea why I also
got a few bits from Zara and it has to
be
I love these and I think my favorite
perches and it's these little Payton
like what do you call these like donate
shoes or ballerina shoes which are
absolutely fabulous I wish you could see
the front I'm gonna zoom in city folk
this is what they look like here
and they're absolutely so cute little
Payton shoes and there those are more or
less than a be for work but they were
only 20 pounds so I was like oh my gosh
that is amazing this I've realized like
this cameras making things that really
weird because these look blue but well
they are kind of blue but they're like a
grey blue actually it does look a bit
grey blue but these are skinny jegging
leggings and I really love this kind of
distressed gray and looks really nice
and like slouchy clothes and stuff like
that but I love these these are again
only 20 pounds as well from Zara this
bag was might descend the pic with
JustFab and I'll put a link below I
absolutely love this bag when this bag
came through but my old work bag I'd
bend it over this is my new work bag
like I love this and like it's really
big and it's got loads of different
compartments on the inside and it's like
great I can fit my laptop in it as well
remember I've got a really mini laptop
for work and I just love this and can
you guys see the quilt detail so that's
the crook toe detail they're really
really cute I love this bag so the urban
retreat boutique and I think they're
based in Harrods they basically sent me
a massive box and like beauty stuff and
I just pulled up some of the main things
I was really happy to receive I was
really happy to receive everything but
the key things I was like yes
so first of all it's this you can't
really see very well but it's this
devout argon bronzing oil and you think
what am I using
1:04 girlf that's how I get my glow and
I love this because in the winter I can
get very sallow and it adds really nice
texture and everything to me so I love
that and I got to OPI nail polishes and
I've never had an API before I've never
felt inclined to buy them I've got a
topcoat and I've got the red one here as
well it's good vodka and caviar it's
absolutely gorgeous I also got the NARS
super orgasm Luminator this stuff is the
bomb someone who loves a glow and this
really really gives me a girl I love
this so I also bought from lash on this
popcorn lip scrub because we ended up
getting loads of people products from
lush because the last got some great
stuff looks like Mike's sister and stuff
but I've been suffering from really dry
lips recently over the winter it's just
been absolutely nuts dry so I bought the
lip scrub to basically use and then turn
moisturize and hopefully come up with a
new lip regime to get mine it was
perfect again if you guys want to see
anything like a hit regime let me know
because I could probably do a video on
that okay so I'm going to move on to all
the kind of home staff and the Christmas
gifts by Igor as well so yay I got the
MacBook Pro this was the gift from the
hubby so I didn't get much else besides
this but I never thought I'd be one of
these mad people like only I might be a
zani know that that but like I got the
iMac last year and I really Mike I
mean I really thought that I needed the
pill but I really felt like I needed a
laptop just because when the iron Mac
it's got great processing and it can
hold know as well if I need to move
about when there I can't do that so
Hobby bought me this and said that this
will be useful means that I can sit with
my laptop in bed rather than sitting in
a room of this thing so yay for my
sister she got me these really and I'm
showing you
because they can be like you can see
them but she also got me a rice cooker
because she knows I didn't have one and
my love right but I got these as well
these little lotion tubs I don't know if
you can see I'm gonna have to zoom in
again can you see that how is that
purple purple I was also given this mug
from Mike's on and it says keep calm and
carry on the shopping and what how cute
is that obviously she knows we fed it
well so she put me pick me in this
really cute Cup which nobody is allowed
to use in my house but me again I think
most people got me power stuff because
they knew that we just moved in and
there's loads of bits and bobs that we
need but we've got this little wood
plaque here which says and then if you
can see it says friends welcome and then
they also got this one here which is
live well live well laugh often and love
much so cute
can you see that it's live well laugh
often not much they also got one of
these which says home sweet home so I'm
just hanging this off my door now it's
really cute actually got that from my
boss what my money joined the project
that one really nice to be totally
honest with you that's actually it for
this that I can kind of come and show
you as I say that we didn't get much
like barely get much physical gifts but
I'm gonna take some of that other
Homestuck dive holds as well over the
past few weeks so firstly I've got these
little heart stones which say love no
luck happiness and peace and this is
from that shop called tiger it's a bit
like I care but smaller and I've only
ever seen it two or three times but I
love these they just look really nice on
my windowsill or in a table and they
were only thinking about a pound each
and they're really heavy these are the
great paperweights and stuff like that I
went into IKEA as well and I kind of
went trinket as I call it from kit crazy
and I've bought about three of
these candleholders so don't know if you
can see my candles over there
I've got two of the short ones and one
of the long one and it's and if you
could see that and if you can see how
pretty it looks and oh it's really
bright but I also bought a number of
candles as well this is a polka dot one
and I've also got a striped one and I
think this is again $1.99 and I also
uncas the outside I also bought this
really nice Miller for my King and it
was I think this is actually only five
pounds and this is absolutely fabulous
and love this but also bought another
mirror for my kid which you might be
able to see behind me but it's too heavy
for me to bring over sir you get the
idea that's over there but not the piece
of Homer thing I wanted to show you is
this mammoth Cup great if you like tea
no I'm joking it's not fatigue it's for
putting plants in and I don't know who
got me this actually generally don't
know if you've got minutes but I was
like this needs to be shown in a haul
it's like Mad Hatter's Tea Party how
cute is this
I love it I love the color and of
everything that I love having plants in
my room so I'm really glad that someone
got me this so some other random things
I've got a things like hangers and
basically I've got my new wardrobe like
I'm gonna keep my wardrobe really clean
and a massive clean-out and I decided I
wanted all the same hangers and I hate
like Clippy hangers and ideas that just
fell basically and my stuff always falls
off so I found out about these flock
velvet hangers and I bought a bunch of
them from eBay and Amazon and I put the
links below and I think initially I
bought them in Tesco and I got twelve
twelve for twenty pounds or something
like that or so it was quite expensive
about 20 pounds and there weren't that
many then I went online and literally
found better quality ones and it was 25
pounds for 50 so I will achieve apace
most of my
with these hangers and they're like a
flock velvet and they look really nice
and basically they all your clothes
stick onto this so it doesn't fall out
so I love those again probably if you
watched my vlog channel you would have
seen me talk about those before but I'm
also doing a lot of decorating and some
of you might know and like we tried to
not buy everything new and everything
from my care and we bought some like
solid word dresses from a local guy and
I have not dresses bedside cabinets and
I didn't like the handles so I went
online and found these draw knobs and
they're in like a gorgeous crystal and
they were I think I got these for 11
pounds for eight and literally I went
into Zara home Zara had one of these for
$4.99 so I had an absolute bargain then
lovely I might show you what it looks
like when I do a room tour one day they
also bought another set of doorknobs
which you probably can't see but this is
white with chrome around it and this is
from my room in here for those of you
who would like just trying to spruce up
their room all you need to do is buy
little things here and there get your
dad's drill or screwdriver and just like
put replace like knobs and handles and
like things were just little things that
I'm really cheap rather than buying a
whole new dress up a whole new wardrobe
just buy a new hat indoors and give it a
coat of paint or something like that and
I also bought this handler as well to
add on to my shoe cupboard which is
absolutely cute and it's again it's just
to make it look a bit more unique versus
looking right the same stuff that you
find everywhere and finally guys I went
into Matlin I never go into Mac man
litchi Michael went to like screw fix
like some build a man shop and Matlock
was the only thing
and I went in there and I like oh my
gosh what is this flip it I've raised
him right
so I bought these storage boxes and then
we could see them this massive box for
basically hats belt extra shoes and
extra bags that I don't have a place for
and I bought three of these and they're
massive right they're massive and
already you could see some fur hats and
belts in there but I bought that and
that was five-pound and I've got them I
have to show you I've got them just
above my shoe shoe dresser thingy Bob
and it looks really cute and it means
that you can put all your junk in there
if you've got extra makeup or or junk
you don't want this thing is amazing for
that and they also bought this welcome
mat from there as well and this was five
pounds again I was just like what so
this is why pound it's a welcome mat for
downstairs and we'll just so it was
really pretty and really homely so this
is my final amazing bit from land and
this is 20 pounds and it's more like
it's couldn't ottoman it's like a seat /
box / storage / everything I love it
I'll move back because it will wear
because it could be hard to see you but
so it's like this you can sit on it and
it's got storage over the inside 20
pounds guys if you don't want to buy new
cupboards you don't want to buy new
dresses this is amazing basically I've
really put all my like electrical stuff
in there rollers and closed it up put it
under a table it was absolutely fabulous
you could get a whole load in there I'm
actually going to buy another one of the
because it's absolutely so guys that's
it for the horn I know it's a bit random
a bit hey buddy pick a deeper if you
guys want to see more like holmes deck
or type stuff but i'm definitely in the
process of buying a lot more stuff for
the house and if you don't like it sorry
and we'll be done soon so don't worry
make sure if you're gonna check out my
vlog channel as well because it's a lot
more fun over there oh no it's not it's
