jumper pajama but a Christmassy one and
I told the guys that that's what I was

how I make it work for me and of course

excited and I I don't really do makeup
tutorials as much as I would like to but
I think I will cuz I might do them I'm
like in the mood we've just had like a
90s right back I've been getting
emotional over here you know love in it
but I'm going to leave you guys to enjoy
the video and make sure you stay tuned
for the bloopers as well because there's
some funny movement alright catch you
guys soon so first things first I am
starting off with my eyebrows and I'm
using my Tom Ford eyebrow kit to fill in
my brows and I'm using my bare minerals
concealer as my eyebrows are slightly
struggle right now I move on to use my
concealer under my eyes tile at my face
and my nose and I'm using my artiste
brush to blend that in I'm going ahead
with my wire sell foundation I've not
used this in quite a while but I brought
it back out because I run out my Lancome
and I actually remember I love this one
I'm just going to set my eyes with the
Sasha so these are the two quads from
the collection and the quad I'm using is
called it's everything and this has got
more cooler colors it's got the more of
ammo and Silver's and I found these to
be really nice and pigmented on my eyes
and I don't normally wear these colors
but they looked a really nice on I went
in for the more of a movie grey on my
eyes and then I went in with the purpley
color in my crease these are more of a
shimmer but they're not too glittery
they're very
very pretty
and then when in a with the darkest
shade just to add a little bit of depth
to my eye as well after that I went
ahead and just got rid of my powder and
blended everything out and then I'm
going in with the liner also from the
collection and I noticed that this clip
blind that isn't actually a black it's
more of dark brown but it still worked
on me anyway and I thought it was very
nice I'm just going ahead and putting
some mascara on my eyes as well the
lashes I have are from backstage lashes
and they're really glamorous spot kind
of fluttery as well this is like a
really nice shape for someone with my
eyes and have a look at the highlight
that is this highlight not like it is so
gorgeous and I love the way it looks on
the inside like I was just enjoying some
Moriah and I went ahead and added the
blush as well which although I thought
was quite nice it looked lovely on me
now honestly most of the lip colors are
very light and very pale so I must line
them with a darker color I'm using
bittersweet from Matt this is a nice
warm brown and I can go in with the
liner on the inside then the lipstick
I'm using is called darling which is
quite light but when I go ahead and
apply the gloss on top
this is draping lava it all blends in
seamlessly I think I actually ended up
singing a song and it just looks really
fabulous and diva-ish and gorgeous I
love it so there's also a loose powder
called touch me butter which is so nice
like with this puff and everything and I
just decided to go home and put it on my
face but when I blended that all in all
my gosh it was kind of popping I also
put it on my body and as you can see I'm
shimmering I also went ahead and just
added a little bit more blush just to
blend everything in because my highlight
was popping and I had to strike my
biggest a diva pose because I really
felt like just that girl and it's just
such a nice and a fun look it's very
glamorous as well and I had to put my
unit on this is hair from white hair
