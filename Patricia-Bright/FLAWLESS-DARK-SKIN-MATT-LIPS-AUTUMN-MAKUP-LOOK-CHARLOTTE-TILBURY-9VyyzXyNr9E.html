hey guys welcome to my channel today I
have a beauty tutorial for you as you
can probably tell as the face is
absolutely bare to start off with but
today I wanted to show you kind of how I
might just get a beautiful even glowy
skin tone and like just highlight and
everything you guys know that I'm
obviously chocolate I am very very
cheerful Deanna's milky as they come and
I'm using the retoucher from Charlotte
Tilbury
she's extended the range for darker skin
tones girls for darker skin tones out
along will you guys or you know the
lightest skin tones but it's hard out
here for some of us alright you guys
know it is especially when you want like
the high-end luxury star sometimes it's
like excuse me get me my stuff well
she's extended the range and it is
absolutely gorgeous so I'm going to show
you how I kind of create a look and I'm
also using her Mac revolution lipsticks
as well I'm going to do this video as a
chatty video as I go along so first
things first I am using the magic cream
from Charlotte Tilbury and everyone
talks about this cream like it is the
cream of like the gods it really is like
it genuinely really it's like a facial
it's like a primer as well so it's great
just before makeup
so next I'm using the retouch art and
I'm using the color 8 it's a deep medium
I didn't think this color was going to
suit me but it's literally perfect and
got such easy application I'll use this
to highlight underneath for my eyes
and I'm just going to use my hand to
blend everything and I probably put on a
little bit too much to be honest I might
have meant is perfect if you can see how
warm this color is it's so long I'm just
going to blend that a little bit more
with my foundation brush and I'm just
going to put a little bit of a darker
color just around the rest of my face
because obviously that's just to
highlight
now you can kind of see how soft that
looks and it's so mad especially for
those of you who have read an oily I
found that like I don't get any creasing
or anything underneath here and it's so
just beautiful so I'm just going to fill
in my brows slightly now my brows took a
really long time to do so I just use an
angle brush and a cream gel to kind of
make them look kind of neat and I always
say eyebrows our sisters not twins
because mine don't even naturally look
the same so when I fill them in they're
not going to
I'm going to use another color in the
retoucher just to highlight around my
brows as well I'm using the ten dark in
the retoucher which is just a bit more
Walmart and I'm going to use that around
my brows
so I'm just going to use one quad to do
my look I'm going to use the vintage
vamp quad which is gold and Purple's my
favorite you guys have been saying to me
Oh Patricia you need to wear a bit more
color the most I'm going to wear is
purple and this is it and then I'm going
to add the purple which is just a nice
rich purple that looks so pretty oh my
gosh I didn't even need to put a lot on
and it's like just so strong
and I've added a bit of the dark brown
and gold from the golden goddess squad
as well just because I really like that
color so let's add some drama to this
ladies I am going to use the rockin Kohl
eyeliner and I'm just going to get it in
there
it's good mascara as well
so I added some lashes and a little bit
more line as you can see added a bit
more drama to my eye and I was thinking
that you know what I'm going to
highlight a little bit more I feel like
that color was so natural with me but
I'm going to do a bit more drama and I'm
gonna go for the that was eight medium
but I'm actually going to go for
something a little bit lighter let's go
for the seven I'm going to use the beach
stick it's in a color called Ibiza which
is kind of like a gold and it's just
gorgeous I just like roll it on here
it's gorgeous and I just blend it and it
smells delicious oh my gosh what so good
so actually that purple that I used on
my eyes I'm going to use it on my cheeks
I have a feeling it's going to look
really nice I learnt that from my makeup
artist who did my wedding makeup she
used purple and it looks so nice
that is gorgeous okay let's move on to
the lips I am using the Mac revolution
lipsticks they are amazing I have a
whole collection of them so if you want
to see more check out my blog as
Patricia brighten up code at UK will
have a post and swatches with everything
but I'm going to show you two looks
because then I couldn't decide between
like a dark berry look or nude let's go
for the new first let's go for the new
first I'm just going to line my lips a
little bit I'm using this Carlisle
called very Victoria oh this is
everything this is definitely that kind
of Kylie Jenner nude very 90s
next color I'm going to use is this kind
of berry it's called lovely Liberty Oh
PC this berry how gorgeous it is and I
can even make it stand out a little bit
more
I just concealer on it so guys I hope
you enjoyed my tutorial and I really
want to say thank you to the guys at
Charlotte Tilbury who gave me all the
products that I used in this video let
alone the fact that they have extended
the range of the retoucher which is so
amazing I feel like I'm glowing and the
