first video in my you know kind of more
wearable looks so today is gonna be the
first look which is just how I do my
kind of foundation for you know darker
skin and those who don't want to look
too cakey and just too heavy in their
face or like they're wearing a lot of
makeup which is what I don't like to
look like so I hope you enjoyed this
video and yeah watch out guys so I'm
gonna like partially talk through this
and partially speed up all I need for
that my full natural-looking face is my
Mac concealer which is in the NC 15 and
my Mac mineralize sometimes I might use
this tone what do they call it
select cover-up as well sometimes it
just depends on what kind of coverage
I'm going for sometimes I use that one
and that's also in insulin I probably
would use 2 to 3 brushes if that really
if I'm just being extra and these are
all my Sigma brushes I use the ss190 to
apply concealer to my dark areas I use
the Sigma whatever it is called because
this isn't my brush mum okay so anyway I
use my brush like that for applying
their mineralized and stifling brush
also just to blend it all in
so first thing I do is apply a concealer
to all my dark areas so what you can see
is that I've got like lots of little
ones
I'm currently working on it with them
what do they call it the they call it
the Clinique would you actually just dot
it on to on top of the dark spots
and then I apply it under my eyes to
give me a juvie look
okay then I'm gonna try to surprise it
the dark areas around here but not too
much because it ends up just looking a
bit blotchy because this is my darker
area and then I will apply my
mineralized lightly just all over
my focus is well in the dock area
and voila that is ritual how I do kind
of my natural looking foundation look
and you know I look kinda chewy and not
cakey either so um if you want to keep
watching the video I'm going to go ahead
and just complete my entire face</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
