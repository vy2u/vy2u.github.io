to my channel today I am bad face and
feel a little beautiful however my
eyebrows are not leaking I hate when
people say eyebrows on fleek actually
we're not going to say my eyebrows are
undone so today I wanted to do a brow
tutorial because I actually haven't done
one before you and I feel like I really
stepped up my eyebrow game and I'm very
happy with the way that they are
currently looking I don't take too much
time when it comes to doing eyebrows
because you know my life is not set up
that way I don't have 20 minutes for
eyebrows so I'm going to show you what
I'd like to do to do it quick and easy
hopefully you guys enjoy I have the
product listed in the description bar
below but right now I'm going to come in
and we're going to get up close and
personal
all right people we are up close and
personal please ignore the spots tatted
on my head skin color perfect all the
time so yeah here are my brows in their
natural form as a company stands and
more of an eyebrow pencil kind of girl
versus a gel I like to have one tool
unless it's like a special occasion so
normally I used to use the Loreal brow
artist shape up which is a pencil and it
has white on the other end but they have
the new brow artist expert love love
love this and this is basically got a
spoolie on one end and the color on the
other end and it has a tapered tip which
is so good
means that you can do your eyebrows
really quickly and you can really get a
perfect shape courses and the kind of
girl who's doing my eyebrows and a full
beat on the train I have a lot of time
to message three different tools not ah
I got everything I need in a one only at
the front I like to brush it upwards and
at the end I like to brush it downwards
and it's so that I have that kind of
evil watch if that makes any sense I
don't like that so I like to bring it
down to give me a stalactite eyebrow I
like to draw a line at the bottom and
the line at the top and then I like to
fill it out with lines on the inside and
why I love this is it's super Krete
creamy and you get a lot of payoff I
like to kind of take
smash me down and also slightly forward
just in case you're wondering my shade
is ebony which is really nice start and
warm shade then I use the spoon II but
also just brush some of the pigment
through
I'll see that I'm telling you that you
took like a minute and a half you see I
have some flyaways and whisks up here
I'm not about to start cutting pressure
ever I don't have though we're just kind
of connected then let's go ahead and I
can seal this is my favorite favorite
favorite brush I think it's on backstage
Beauty it's got this kind of flat tip
this is so ridiculous I love it to apply
concealer and flexible when it comes to
which concealer I use and I'm gonna go
ahead Bernard soft matte complete
concealer why I love of statute is
because I can just create a really nice
and tidy line
and make me see how sharp that line is
you could cook
hey eyebrow very good and then normally
when I've done this I'll kind of brush
it through and see I'll create a bit
more fluff at the front of it as well
my eyebrows are completely different
shapes naturally I'm trying to make them
what the same but this one wants to go
all the way up to here listen I'm down
with darling come down well ok you don't
have to run
okay so this is my brown done the
offices and octagons if I have to get
them exactly the same at least I get
them tidy I'm going to finish my face
I'm sure you must commissioner so guys
that is my finished look at photo just
to give it to my feet with the red lips
and everything as you can see I feel
like my eyebrows look good and you know
they can go from zero to hundred very
easily very quickly and yes that is it
guys so in the meantime I'll catch you
later more videos on the weekend so yeah
I will see you guys soon hi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
