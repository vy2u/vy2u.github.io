gold hello beautiful people welcome to
my channel I hope you are doing well I'm
excited and I always have people and if
you don't know I have just come back
from beautiful party and I'm inspired
and I am feeling extra feminine and
wonderful wonderful I went with the
L'Oreal Paris team and we did all kinds
of goodness and it's just lovely to be
around just fabulous women just doing
their thing and they had this amazing
epic show of all women's of all shapes
of all sizes of all ages it's just been
great so while I was there I was a
naughty girl but I regret nothing I
decided to spend some money at Sephora
Sephora is actually from Paris the
first-ever store is in Paris so I had to
go I had to spend some money I spent 391
euros it had to be done I had to get
some goodies lingos with me as well and
she loves love of beauty so me and her
we basically did like a supermarket
sweet - in Sephora we had like an hour
we were like do you like to double a
Hello
it has an amazing Instagram ah she's a
beauty girl and I'm stealing her because
we are in Paris and we are going to go
to support and I want her to tell me
what I should get
so yeah we're about to spend some money
in Sephora the first flora ever was came
in from Sephora is a French press don't
do that so we are in Paris I need all of
them your God polo I was just looking at
concealer from bite every it looks
really creaming it looks really nice and
then links for it it was 34 dollars
yes I got some skincare goodies cuz I
love me some skincare I got some freebie
this is a full face of the Sephora
goodie so as you watch this video you
can see me create a full face of all the
goodies and then I'll just show you some
of the other bits and bobs I've got as
well okay so one of the first pieces of
skincare that I got was from dr. jar and
these are rubber masks I saw these I was
like what the hell are these I want to
go with the firm lover because you know
I'll show you go with bright love I do I
want a glow do I wanna know glow let's
do it go let's see if I've got a glow
after I use this all right step one this
is the bread and lover you put this over
your face first oh ok hello cream 10
euros 50 I would expect you'd like
multiple mars-like not just one mark oh
it's cold
I'm putting this on my face first and
they said click Lots on me oh you know
what I was gonna say something really
unsavory and I'm not I'm not gonna do it
today is not the day I'm a Chris yeah
but this is looking this is look it this
is looking no it's really cool though
there's nice how I'll do you guys
watching I need to know before I start
cracking no jokes that are for people
who are slightly immature much like
Jenny's oh yes come through masks how
does this fit my face so well Lich's
you're right exactly at my nose and
stuff no this one's scary this is a
really nice mask
this isn't like those paper sheet masks
this is one different kind of mass made
and you know what they've done they've
made this in a way even if have you if
you have an extra large head I some of
you guys if those head thus extra large
there's room I'm just gonna I'm just
going to enjoy this and I'll come
Teela okay I'm gonna slap you guys
aren't follow me on snapchat make sure
you follow me on snapchat or no
Instagram I'm not you gonna do an
Instagram stories as well okay if that
is my time up my face is tingling
definitely very rub all that is giving
me free Nelly
please don't look like that although ma
that's do you know what track Romania is
a good track Romania or something at the
other sphere of small holes this right
here it's making my skin crawl like the
fact that there are little holes and
stuff I can't handle it I don't like it
I'm gonna take this off my face right
now it's a natural thing if you have
like a fear of textures and I don't like
little holes or so can each don't like
little holes and like I don't like tree
bark and stuff like that
I don't even know how I'm gonna edit
this I'm not gonna listen I'm not going
to edit this section because I can't
look at those okay you meant to Pat it
in okay I do not think you need to put
anyone near as much as I put on just
then oh but my skin looks are really
nice I love this nice to be honest I
feel like that's what kind of Moss that
you put on before you go to bed but I do
look bright up but I am bitchy glowing
hello I'm actually going and the
products are sitting on my skin I can
see what my skin looks like and it's not
like I love this when I grow like this
oh yes listen I'm not mad at that at all
okay next I saw this on display and this
is the zoeva rose gold luxury set it's
eight brushes and it was on display and
they looked for norm in all it was 75
euros for the zoeva brush there and it
will say
came with this there's not actually
foundation brush a foot of your
foundation brush ok so next up I'm
trying the Sephora this is their own
brand foundation this is the ten I will
wear perfection foundation and the shade
I got was 56 but to be honest I feel
like my actress age is yeah I feel like
my actual shade was 57 but there was
none in stock
okay so it isn't so bad up here but it's
probably a little bit light for my
darker area but we're just gonna go in
okay that was one pun oh okay no this
could work this kind of work is quite
full coverage it's full coverage oh I'm
not mad at that
and it's it's more the yellow which I
really like oh that's nice oh oh it is
full coverage I wonder if it's Matt okay
medium coverage and buildable
I feel like potentially you need two and
a half to three full pumps for this
listen I am living for the foundation
I'm gonna go with my brow gel this is
from L'Oreal Paris this is my like
regular go-to badge epic gel I love it
okay so my next item is from by Terry
and this is a corrective concealer I
feel like I was really inspired by the
guys I was with Lydia's a huge fan if
you don't know look Lydia should check
her out she's absolutely lovely and she
is a huge fan of by Terry and she's like
you have to try that concealers and she
just loves the whole range she was right
right let me pick up a concealer and the
shade I picked up is 12 and it's called
warm copper that might tear drop shape
okay oh it's creamy it's really really
creamy their shades a little salmony for
me I like a light concealer but I like
it can see that with a little bit more
of a yellow okay maybe
chez down might have worked let me blend
that in and see what that's looking like
form is really nice actually it blends
in beautifully it's really smooth and
really creamy okay do you I feel like
that is blending in but it's a it's a
lot more of a colder color than I'd
normally go for so I'm just gonna go in
with my trusty Kevin a Quan can never do
me wrong says you see that's really
yellow
let's conceal these eyebrows because
they're looking a little bit mm-hmm this
brush is not working for my eyebrows
it's giving me it's giving me stress
real stress this is my favorite kind of
eyebrow brush
and I'm just contouring with this matte
stick for Mac just blending that in the
next thing I bought was this set this is
an eyeshadow set from a brand called
black heart which is a brand that is
focused towards dark skin so like for
you know for the black or the chocolate
sisters for their Asian sisters it's
caters to darker skin tones and I think
it's also a French brand as well they
have these eyeshadow palettes they had
this one that was gorgeous like electric
and amazing and I was like Patricia the
way your makeup skills are set up is
that potentially you should just stick
to nude with a little bit of gold so
this palette is called the brown palette
always pretty ah there's a lot of
beautiful colors here anyway let me
swatch this let's swatch nice it's in
the shade I thought it was going to be
there flu it's gonna be a bit more
orange let's try the gold let's try the
gold
okay gold
okay guards the Gold's nice the Gold's
really nice I'm just I was just
expecting a little okay that Browns nice
they're just quite they're quite dry
they're actually quite dry anyway let's
go in let's see what we can make work
with our eyes I'm going to go in with
this luxe soft definer brush and I'm
gonna go in with the like this is like
an oh okay nice picking up nicely on the
brush and going in above this I'm gonna
take it back then always go with my
swatches but it was looking like
struggle but my eye however would the
brush we've got color pale
I try and go this brown and then maybe
this this one over here you know I feel
like I feel like the brushes are like in
like a really fluffy brush that's why I
feel like I'm missing here
but this luxe petite crease brush is
really nice so like the colors kind of
smooshed into one this is like an orange
before and now it's like a burn mmm that
set the brush set is not giving me
everything I need when it comes to and
like creating a really nice eye but it's
I picked up two other brushes these are
from Marc Jacobs can you see them and
you see this one here this is what I'm
talking about I need a brush like this
and this is called the shadow brush and
then there's also definer brush that set
is lacking this you need this in every
like essential brush set let's go for
the gold that was just giving us all
life hmm
okay well that's nice gold quite layers
to it as well a little bit of a darker
gold
oh just added the darker gold on the
outside and I like that and they said
Marc Jacobs brush um I could tell though
when you feel the weight of it it just
felt like it was gonna be good this
palette was 49 euros that's really
expensive for that pack for this palette
it's way too expensive way too expensive
that is expensive AF why is it so
expensive my thoughts on this palette is
overall is that it's actually really
nice and really pigmented it could
definitely have had more Maps more
browns more burnt orange is to be a real
real nude but it's not bad but $49 is
too expensive
it's too expensive I'm sorry Wow like No
okay so lashes unknown on eyes and I'm
done
next I need to set with powder and I
don't know I picked up this powder again
it's a for own brand I feel like I
should call this almost a full faith of
Sephora own brand and then some other
bits and bobs
this is the smoothing and brightening
powder Ling said to me that this will
not make me look ashy in gray so I'm
gonna trust her but I run away from
white powders I run for my life I'm
going to go in with the powder brush
here oh no we're great but gray they're
gray
we're gray we're not the greatest but
we're great I can see it in me that I
just look grayish no and this is why my
powder of choice remains Sascha yellow
and Laura Mercier and I love the Laura
Mercier one in the brown so yeah I need
to look rich in color and in life you
know what's crazy what I feel is like
whatever I did with the makeup combo I
just did is that it didn't need powder
but hopefully when I use a setting spray
we'll bring it back because now I look
great
alright so next I'm gonna go in with
some fenty Beauty and the shade I'm
gonna go in with is actually ginger
binge and Moscow Mule on a more everyday
basis this is actually the shade by wet
I wear and I find that it's a really
nice highlight color for every day and
although it's a pink on me it's just
like just the perfect highlight shade
and I need it cuz I look great right now
okay so next I am gonna use a sephora
own brand lip liner oh it's spinning
amazing sigh hate sharpening this is
nice okay so for our own brand lip liner
my favorite shade is kind of bittersweet
for Mac love Mac bitter see it's a
really nice dark brown oh I feel
inspired to do a dark lip now we're
gonna do you know Tbilisi just kind of
went a bit south so I was getting a bit
upset don't know if you guys feel when
I'm like my energy goes oh this is
another lip color from Sephora's own
brand
and the shade is number 26 pretty urban
and then I'm gonna mix that with a shade
here called pink latte that lip is
drying down into something really
beautiful for the face I have the
Sephora this is the set and refresh
brain I'm hoping this is just gonna give
me back a little life like the girl
needs a little bit more growth and I'm
gonna shape this very well alright guys
that is that my fall face done
yeah I feel like we were able to bring
it back it was looking a little bit
Ghost Face killer there but yeah we're
alright I like it the lip for me I'm
surprised at how this has just dried
down into something fabulous now that my
face is done should we get into some of
the skincare I've got going on here you
guys know I'm obsessed of skincare and
then you guys who haven't seen you do so
much skincare stuff on here but for
those of you who watch me for really
long you know like having the ultimate
skin care is essential for me and I saw
this
anytime anything says peeling I'm on it
because I live for like my acids and all
that jazz and then this comes up like a
micro pads and this peeling milk and
this is from a Korean skincare brand and
they had this whole section that had all
this Korean skincare that looked
fabulous and this looks right up my
string and it's from dr. jart after that
I picked up this fresh deep hydration
facial toner and we saw this and we like
it's just so pretty do you ever buy
stuff just because it's pretty oh this
is from fresh if you can see the light
on it facial toner look those are rose
petals right on the inside that smell
this I can smell the rose coming through
oh okay
feel like I went kind of Korean skincare
crazy but this is a brand that I know
and love this is a Boreum a few months
back I told you about some goodies that
I've got from AB or AB or Ian that
laughs and this is a black cleansing oil
purifying cleansing oil with charcoal
it's got charcoal in it I'm here for it
black cleansing or I wonder if it's
actually black let's see are you black
oh look guys the cleansing oil is black
oh my gosh oh that's sick oh it went
from black to just creamy okay so this
is my free gift that I got for spending
money oh and I'm seeing some great items
in here it's this is so for a makeup
remover this is the shade Lolita from
Kat Von D this is the advanced night
repair from Estee Lauder and then I got
this Dior eye primer oh and I also got
this as a free sample I didn't see this
this is from Givenchy give me free stuff
Oh what the hell is that what is that is
that black oh sucking but if you guys
can see that grace is that that is
amazing I think I'm gonna call this
