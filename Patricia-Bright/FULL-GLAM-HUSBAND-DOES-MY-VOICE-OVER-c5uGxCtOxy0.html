different it's Mike here and I am taking
over we'll be doing the voiceover for
this video hope you guys enjoy
okay so in today's makeup tutorial I'm
going to be using some products how this
lovely golden box from look fantastic
and doesn't she look fantastic ladies oh
she's gonna look even more fantastic by
the end of this process so we just put
on some like moisturizer or primer maybe
and to start off with and then we're now
quickly moving on to the eye brows which
are a little bit sparse naturally so I'm
just gonna thicken them out a bit you
know give them a little bit more umph
give a little more depth give a little
bit more Vavoom
and just you know shouldn't some love
alright so now I have a thin brush and
some kind of eyebrow definer kind of
thing and she made that out but anyway
yeah what you want to do is just use
like a smooth kind of swooping motion
around the eyebrow give it that sharp
defined look that everybody will be
going nuts for making a more flaky get
this bit right guys and you will be
winning so yeah that is what we are
doing right now and good job good job
Patricia very smooth and coordinated and
there what that okay right now that
funny line down the nose looks a little
bit strange at the moment but I'm sure
it will all make sense in the end so
bear with us now we've got a sponge and
I'm gonna dab on some guesses and some
foundation or some sort of highlight or
contour maybe I'm just throwing words
out there now don't really think I'm
using the right ones but I think it's
foundation anyway maybe not maybe okay
this sponge thing is actually totally
badass though ladies if you haven't got
one get yourself one of these pretty
cheap essential in your makeup tool kit
saves you having to use your thumb just
going to suck my cheeks in now and give
the
cheekbone check your line a little bit
of a swoop little adapt a bit more
dabbing dab dab dab dab dab dab dab dab
dab all around the nose we're looking a
little bit funny at the moment but then
we're all get there in the end so don't
forget to do around the hairline as well
make sure you cover everywhere and okay
fine so we're still going on with the
gabbie sponge the blender having a bit
of a dance always helps just smoothing
all over make it all nice and even and
blend it together oh yeah looking good
good job Patricia good job okay zoomed
in a little bit get more singing fit
more funny faces and now oh gosh Sasha
powder don't get me started with this
stuff it might be good for makeup but
this flippin powder gets everywhere it
just covers every surface it spills out
guaranteed when you screwing it off it
flies out everywhere it don't get me
started
okay anyway I just missed a step there I
think we've got some soft palate which
okay yeah there's a pallet in Illamasqua
palette that we're now going over the
eyelids with going for a bit and a ready
tone today a little bit different but
you know nice and warm for the winter
season and also gonna maybe use some
beige in there as well Lister give it a
little accent cool face showroom
everybody pull some really funky looking
faces when they're doing makeup it's all
the concentration of going on but yeah
okay right so we've got a nice Tarte
palette here that we're going to be
using to add some more more eyelid
effect with the brush
Oh going for another color as well
what's this now what would have you done
this bit you're doing it again
right maybe we're adding a little bit
more God knows okay right oh this bit is
important do you need a smooth and
steady hand here ladies no shaking on
this point we've got the eye
this is eyeliner that we're using now
and we are going to be going for a
winged eyeliner which is just lovely
okay so we've got a thing that much yet
mascara okay so we're going to just pick
them up those eyelashes so when you
really slept it has to full effect
no flutter so we're going to be
thickening them out top and don't fit at
the bottom you'll never get the bottom
eyelash either want to poke your eye out
while you're doing it and then we are
going to then smoothing out all that
powder okay right on with the falsies on
with the falsies this is a yeah and I
never quite know how he does this
because you have to stick glue on it and
then stick it on your eyelash but it
seems to work and then yeah looks great
look at them look at them look at that
look at that look at our looks great
doesn't it okay so now we're gonna add
in a little bit of red warmth to the
corner for this look today guys not
something we do too often but yeah look
kind of cool isn't it and then indeed
teared up the area we're just gonna
apply some gold stuff some gold eye
stuff yeah that's what it is
gold eye stuff good job Mike
alright so now we are onto the nose I
think yeah this is contouring what we're
doing here so we're just giving it some
so I don't know I guess shape and
definition of some sort oh now this is I
believe the Mariah Carey range and we
are just dabbing on some highlighter I
think yeah pretty confident I've got
that bit right as well good job Mike
good a highlight a bit of blusher going
on there little Rouge ink and onto the
lips so you want to make sure you line
those lips ladies get them line first of
all and then I apply a little bit of
gloss nobody likes a dry crumbly
crackling looking set of lips they'll
get a bit of gloss on them give them a
little bit of a pout it's all coming
together now you want a bit of a life of
one in there just just because that
looks nice good job okay so oh there we
go all done just like that just like
magic but not magic because you saw how
we did it that is my look for today
thank you guys for watching doesn't she
look stunning give this video a thumbs
up for my kind of feeble attempts at
doing a voiceover kind of fun actually
have a great day and we'll see you next
time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
