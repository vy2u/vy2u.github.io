what's not person it's the second video
of my week of daily videos and it's
going to be the highly requested and
what's in my bag video I have never done
this video in the whole two years that
I've been on YouTube I don't know why I
just thought they were it was a bit
boring but I think it gives you guys
insight into someone's life and what
they are like as a person and I think
that's why do you guys enjoy these so
I'm gonna do this really you want to see
what bad I'm gonna be showing and it's
actually my Prada bag which I bought
recently you're either gonna see in a
hole or have seen it in the hole I
haven't put it up yet I don't know at
this point of time and it's a real point
about I bought this in itself it is and
what I do like about this is its shape
and it's it's big enough you can't even
see it entirely on the screen it's kind
of still classic at the same time but
sorry I'm looking at my screen over
there you can fit loads and loads inside
it but yeah genuine though the black
goes with everything
classic shape but trendy shape as well
blah blah blah let's go ahead and see
what's inside so the first thing that's
in there is my makeup bag and you guys
probably want to know what I carry in my
makeup bag that I take out with me and
I'm not one for doing my makeup outside
I'm one of those people who when I put
my makeup on I'm done I am done done
done but just in case I'm going out or
something like that I have my
mineralized skinfinish in a deep dark
and that's so easy it just Shh sweep it
over my face when I need to and then
I've got my Studio Fix and NW 45 and
again that's the case of if I just have
to touch up for some odd reason I have
these to touch up with I carry just one
brush with me because I can use this for
those powders as well as my blush and
it's from Sigma I don't even know what
it is but whatever I've got my sleek
Santorini blush which you got I wear all
the time I just love it and it looks
good on my skin and you can see what it
looks like that really easy to apply and
blend in and make you look quite
glamorous even if you just look ashy
talking about she my most favorite thing
in the makeup bag is lip gloss and if
I'm form of lip gloss or lip balm or
something is it's essential you dry lips
of the worst looking thing and it is
frustrating and I've got my sleek
palette polish in Montecarlo which is
kind of a pinky color which looks like
that it doesn't come up to you pinky
it's actually quite natural that just
gives that added lift and my concealer
on my Mac I don't know if it's a studio
fix concealer it's in an in WNC 50 and
again that gives you an added lift if
you look a little bit crusty it's
Siddeley but sounds really really bad
okay I'm gonna discuss the important
things I'm inside my bag the first thing
is my word for the day I keep this in my
bag because when I'm on the train or I'm
a bit bored oh I don't know what I'm
doing I'm just lazing about it's lunch I
like to like get something out to Rees
just to kind of encourage myself
throughout the day because you know what
days are like and for you guys who don't
know I'm a Christian so I like to fill
myself with these things and they just
like strong encouraging words one
sentence here or there and the
testimonies of other people who have
gone through similar situations in life
so I find it very very encouraging for
me and having that there as a backup is
really really good and I really really
glad that I can get one of these through
my bag so the next thing that is
genuinely important to me in my bag is
my diary
I don't play when it comes to
organization when it comes to structure
I'm an extremely organized and person
and without a diary I don't know I would
be a madwoman or ripping out my hair
I'll just become a fuse like in a desert
like where am i where am i without my
diary
so you guys can see it like I have what
I call the TTD which means things to do
and I like literally list things out 9
by Ryan I wish you could see things and
I separated so wedding job business
YouTube you know I planned the week
ahead and check off things I need to do
on Monday and check out the things
neuqu√©n at Tuesday and then I got like
a titi be full of the day and yeah guys
you guys do not understand so yeah
you've seen enough of my diary and
enough that you know but I'm in a little
bit crazy
another thing obviously is my wallet I
don't carry cash with me I only have the
cards I only have one card which is my
debit card I do have a credit card but I
never use there so I've got my debit
card or a bank of Santander and yeah but
you know let me tell you what the actual
essential in this all it is it's
actually the Nando's card guys guys guys
I need this like do you know for those
of you don't know Nando's Nando's is a
Portuguese restaurant chain where you
get grilled chicken corn chips rice
mashed potato peas but so many gurus
spits of food and if you have a Nando's
loyalty card its get stamped each time
you go and you get free chicken and I
can't say no to free chicken and I've
got like 12 of these cars stamped like I
just go numbers yeah and so I always
carry one of these with me to make sure
that they get a stamped a few other
things that are really important to me
and kind of random is obviously in my
travel card as you guys know now that I
can't drive so I used the train a lot I
live out in zone six so I just kind of
get into central London either London
Bridge or Victoria whichever one I feel
like going into and yet my oyster card
and and for anyone who doesn't have one
who's under the age of 25 get yourself a
young person's rail card and it gives
you a quarter off travel so for me when
I go up to Manchester it's really really
good and I can use it on every journey
so a standard day travel card is eight
pounds whereas when my young person's
rail card I get it for five pounds 30 so
I get discounts with my YP I always
carry around nail polish remover because
you guys know I really am not that fast
I'm quite laid-back and so I figure well
you know I painted my nails pretty like
three months ago and this little chip in
each it chip and yeah if I have to meet
a client or something like that
I realize that sugar I need to make sure
that my nails are in order if I have
meetings or or whatever I just like get
this out and get my nails looking nice
and fabulous
okay pouty Thermal sometimes because I
may need to have a dick or something and
my iPhone obviously you guys are
mannered I felt like the fact that I can
read documents on here and write notes
and write voice memos those are the kind
of things I use my iPhone for you guys
are going to be so embarrassed but I
actually have no apps
I think the app that I had one app which
was something to do with file files and
documents the the Bible app and that was
it really
I don't have Angry Bird I don't have
anything like okay so my camera decided
to stop recording but as you can tell my
phone is essential to me but not for the
same reason that is for other people I
use it for calls Texas and dogs finally
I'll just show you the most random bits
that I have which is a torch which is
really good in like a dark bag on a dark
night if you're looking for things on
the inside and my pens
I always have pens and moisturizer BAE
45 or another moisturizer I get quite
dry quite easily slowly you don't know
as Sheehan's and stuff like that so I
carry this out with me I hope I've not
missed anything I think that's it so I
hope you enjoyed that and I shall have
more videos this week I don't know
what's gonna be on there but we should
see that's what you guys bye
