obviously I'm looking extremely
glamorous right about now
prom season is in the air if you've been
watching long enough you will know that
I never had a frog that times like when
I was in school they weren't really a
big thing in the UK but now I know
they're becoming like nothing and I love
to do prom video so I can relive those
moments and today it's gonna be extra
special because we've got Mike in here
come along back up here he comes he's
sliding this is an extra-special prom
video because it is in collaboration
with River I learned have got an amazing
competition for you guys to win your
ultimate from experience is one of you
guys will be able to win 250 pounds to
spend at River Island not only that
you're gonna get a makeup grooming and
chauffeur-driven experience to go to
your prom how amazing is that like I
would love that
honey why did you get me that for valya
we didn't actually know each other down
of those days all right so guys it
sounds like a great opportunity doesn't
it so all you need to do is click on the
link in the description bar down below
and enter the competition yeah and good
luck and other than that enjoy this
video we're gonna get our styling on so
guys thanks for watching
so my first look is the little black
dress this is a great look for prom and
I think a great look for any night out
it's something that's very smooth and
elegant about a black dress and you can
dress it up with lots of different
accessories everything I'm wearing is
from River Island so you can find it all
in the description bar below so I'm
wearing a good quality fitted suit here
right for prom you can't really go wrong
with it and you can also add a little
detail with the pocket handkerchief or
square just to give it a little bit of
life
so my next look is a little bit
rebellious and definitely different but
if you go to a school where you can wear
things a little bit more left-field I
love this look I'm especially love this
top because of this detailing if you
don't want to be that proper princess
then you can definitely be the rebel in
a look like this
so my necklace is more of a traditional
prom look and I am wearing a baby doll
dress with gorgeous beading detail on it
and these strappy heels and what I love
about a dress like this though is that
it is a little bit shorter than your
long prom dress and it means that you
can show your legs off but still look
cute and sweet so this look is more of a
smart casual style what I love about
this is that all the pieces could be
worn separately at an another occasion
not only to a prom and I'm wearing it
with a pair of black skinny jeans and
some blue boots
so this next look it's a two-piece look
and this is my favorite out of all of
them I love the detail of this pastel
skirt and I think that if you want to
look smart and pretty and put together
this is a great option and it's got some
lovely detailing and will be flattering
on lots of different body types so
finally I'm wearing the classic prom
dress I absolutely love this look it's
got all the detail beading it's in a
gorgeous light pink color and is
obviously flawless this dress is such
good quality and is so affordable for
such a lovely piece so guys that's it
from Mike and I hope you enjoyed and
you're gonna have an amazing prom or the
details are in the description bar below
and make sure you enter the competition
so today I wanted to talk about adult
versus teenage life just because it's
something that the older I get</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
