video here I hope you don't mind and I
was going to weddings I thought I'd show
you you know I always start off with
moisturizer and a primer you guys also
know I'm a massive fan of the concealer
under the eyes and just as a great way
to highlight for growing up a foundation
is the Bobbi Brown that I've been using
everything's in the description box and
I just love it because it's really
really dewy but I wouldn't recommend it
if you have oily skin so I always fill
my eyebrows in with a pencil and this
has got a hint of purple I'm not sure
what I think of that for now but I love
the finish it gives me
so for special occasions I don't mind
doing a little bit of contouring I'm not
a massive contour uh but here and there
I don't mind you guys know I'm not big
on eye makeup so I just keep it really
really neutral with a gold and some
Browns and some liquid eyeliner for my
lips are lined with a cherry color and
just add a really flirty pink set my
face with some fix me up and let that
dry so for my hair it's just got to be
loose wavy curls I always do with a
straightener really easy to do and it
doesn't matter if they look a little bit
messy
she really gorgeous
I let leather dress from H&amp;amp;M and I just
loved it and I thought it was really
wedding appropriate so you guys might
see my Christian Louboutins a few on
Instagram so I finally have the chance
to wear them and obviously to a wedding
and finally I just topped it off with a
studded bag which is also from H&amp;amp;M
because I hoped you enjoyed and I'll see
you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
