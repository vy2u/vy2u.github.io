see them feel very happy with myself and
this is going to be another get ready
with me video I actually love doing
these and lucky to have a couple of
opportunities to be able to go to and
show you that I'm going to them today is
going to be a get ready with me premiere
I was so lucky to have the opportunity
to go to my first ever movie premiere
and be on the red carpet which was
actually white but it was amazing I went
to the premiere of The Lone Ranger movie
and I went with a number of other
youtubers it was so cool to be able to
go I felt like a superstar on the red
carpet oh that was very very nervous and
stuff and seeing you like people like
Johnny Depp and some of the other actors
there it was just amazing
on the actual day I actually didn't have
any time to show you guys me actually
getting ready because I was in and mad
pandemonium rush and so I recreated the
same look that I had if you want to find
out more on this then check out my blog
which is moment of sterile calm
hopefully it will come up so you guys
make sure you follow me on Instagram as
well
I share loads more pictures over there
this was over a week ago and you know
the pic went on popular page and
everything so if you want to know what's
going on and be up-to-date make sure you
were checking me out over there so guys
anyway I'm not gonna bore you any longer
and I'm gonna let you enjoy this game
so I'll see you guys later bye guys
here goes and I've got clear face and
I'm going to start off with putting on
the dress I'm wearing first this dress
is a hassle to get into I made the
mistake of putting it on the last time
after my makeup and I'm just going to
throw this on to protect myself so start
off with priming my face I rarely ever
Prime but when I'm going out for a big
night definitely near primers
necessaries I then go ahead and apply my
foundation which is my mac matchmaster
in an 8.5 it's my favorite because it's
very mattifying so I've got to fill in
my eyebrows and I just use a pencil and
I brush them and I use a concealer which
isn't too light around the brows just to
define them a little further so on my
eyes I went for a kind of silvery purple
violet it is quite light and then in the
crease I used a darker Brown and this is
from NARS but I put everything in the
description box I really wanted to get
quite a fairly dramatic dark eye in the
crease and I always line my eyes
obviously and add mascara and eyelashes
then go in with some concealer to
basically neaten everything up and
really add some brightness to my eyes I
really want to have that celebrity glow
when I'm going to a premiere so that's
what I did and then I went used a
concealer that was a little darker to
basically highlight the bridge of my
nose and just my forehead and I did
blend that in so ended up using this
banana powder which I found to be
absolutely amazing it really did mattify
my makeup and along with my powder I
really did have a nice finish so finally
I contoured and added a blush and these
are both from sleek but I will put
everything in the description bar so I
lined with my favorite liner which is
from sleek and then I use my Y cell
lipstick but that's not actually what I
used on the day but I thought this was a
nice nude alternative so you guys always
actually about my hair extensions all be
reviewed very very soon but for that
celebrity look I wanted to wear my hair
or to one side to basically show off the
detail on the back of my dress and I
think it's a really cute way to a hair
so I used my favorite method of coiling
which is using straighteners actually
and I just did these all the way down so
that's what it looks like when it's all
done so on the other side I just used
one or two hair pins just to strap it
down slightly and you can see my
peppercorns don't worry I brushed them
away with a little bit of gel so I
definitely felt like this is the
hairspray type of day and I always spray
a little bit on my face it's a great way
to set your makeup although it can be a
bit gross to absorb so I teased out the
curls just a little bit with my hands
and that's me done yay
I'm wearing earrings I hate wearing
earrings but I felt like I definitely
needed some for this day and this
necklace basically set off this dress it
is an amazing piece of art which I
bought from Aldo and I must say I did
buy a new pair of shoes these are from
Steve Madden but I really thought they
were red carpet worthy they were sparkly
and I'll definitely wear them again to a
really nice event because my jewelry was
so chunky I left everything else to a
minimum so guys this is the dress and it
is from Topshop
absolutely love it and I thought I
wasn't going to spend you know hundreds
100 pounds or a new dress but if I could
get something from the high street that
was classy this definitely worked
- cute maxi dress with a lovely high
but that's it guys I hope you enjoyed
that video and I will see you guys later
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
