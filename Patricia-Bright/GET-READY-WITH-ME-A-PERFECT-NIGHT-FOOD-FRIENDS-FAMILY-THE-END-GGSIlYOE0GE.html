and it is inspired by the end of the
world of a work of you me and the
apocalypse a new show that's coming out
on sky1 and it got me thinking if I knew
the end of the world was coming what
would I actually do what we were
favorite foods my favorite people what
would be my last look and who would I
want to spend my last moments list so
today that's exactly what I am sharing
with you and hopefully inspires you to
ask yourself those questions you know
what would you do if you need the end of
the world was coming number while
foundation would have to be their home
10 Idol 24-hour it's an oldie but a
favorite of mine I don't use it that
much but I know I love it after that it
will be the Kevin acquire and concealer
you guys know I've used this for a very
long time and it is very good for a
glamorous and intense look I'm moving on
to my brows I think a gel is always
going to be the best I mean really and I
love Matt dick down to make my brows pop
and then go ahead and use my normal
concealer which more public the Estee
Lauder Double Wear to just make that
nice and neat my favorite eyeshadow is
always something gold brown or bronze
and i love the mac warm neutral palette
to achieve this look and I feel like
this palette you can basically do
everything from highlighting to
sculpting to everything with this
palette you don't need that many I just
blend all my powder in I will always do
a winged eyeliner look because it is my
trademark and sometimes I just add a
little dot I think my favorite mascara I
don't have one I'll go even like my
ultimate eyelashes have to be the ideal
I love to layer them up and they are
cheap and cheerful and looking gorgeous
we're blast should be max fever and I
would go ahead and use Estee Lauder
Double Wear to contour as well but lip
liner will be max chestnut or night moth
and the lipstick would have to be Ruby
woo as well with a gorgeous gloss over
it yeah this would be my trademark final
look if I had to do it moving on to my
hair my favorite hairstyle happens to be
my husband's favorite
tell me which is any time my hair is out
of my face so right now I love just
doing our half up bun and I basically
where hair extensions all the time till
the end of time definitely but I wear
them like just half way past my hair so
I have the front of my hair out which
makes it easier for me to do these kind
of half up hairdos and I use a headband
kind of slick it down and create cars
with the ghd which is a favor of mine as
well I took the bun down but i feel like
i should have kind of left it in but i
do really like this look at the moment i
feel kind of cute and yeah that is my
finished a lot so moving on to perfume
it old favorite is britney spears
fantasy I can't stand the smell of it
now but it always was something I liked
when I was younger and my favorite dress
is this i had this dress about three to
four years now and it still fits me
lovely and it was like my first like
really expensive kind of designer
purchase bought it in singapore and it's
got great memories and i love the way it
fits its always fit like a glove and i
pair with my noobs i love a pair of
boobs and this trusty leather jacket if
you've been watching me long enough
you'll know that I've had this jacket
for like five years and you never know
if I ever needed to run for my life I
need a leather jacket and my Nike
trainers of course this is not the most
fashionable look but if I knew it was
the end of the world then this is what
I'd wear whatever I felt like and
obviously I mentioned I've been inspired
by the new show you me and the
apocalypse coming out on sky1 and it
just made me think like who would I want
to be it would be my friends and my
family and my loved ones and if there's
anything I love doing is actually
cooking I find cooking the funnest thing
and I don't do it as much as I used to
so I would get my friends together and I
would bake them like the best cake ever
and I'm not a baker but if push comes to
shove i'll bake it and i actually ended
up baking this amazing ok maybe not get
carried away but it was a really good
chocolate cake okay um it was really
nice the first time about you made the
chocolate cake and it was good it tasted
great
I would dead and prepare my favorite
meal which is basically okra stew with
lots of other things like onions and
mushrooms and tomatoes and chicken and
all of that good stuff this makes my
mouth water I don't know how many of you
guys love opera but I do this would
easily be on my end of the world foods
to have alongside a rice dish and I
absolutely love red Thai curry because
it reminds of time and which is when my
favorite places to go to and I for so
nostalgic about it and I love the
flavors and I can kind of cook up a mean
red Thai curry with some coconut milk
and all that good stuff tastes delicious
and I would love to just prepare the
meal of all meals with all my friends
and all my family and just bring them
round as we watch you know the end the
world come and reminisce on good times
so check out my cake like it looks
amazing okay kind of falling apart but
the melted chocolate just holds
everything together I know so serving my
friends and family is like the best
feeling in the world there's nothing
like giving of yourself to people and at
the end this is what i could do you know
nothing like just having fun times of
other people that you love so i hope
this video inspires you but also got you
thinking if you knew you had your last
few days to spend on the earth what
would you do what would be your look
well who would you spend time with and
what would you try to change before
those final hours arrived definitely
