and it is inspired by the end of the
world
of a work review me and the apocalypse a
new show that's coming out on sky1
and it got me thinking if I knew the end
of the world was coming
what would I actually do what were my
favorite foods my favorite people what
would be my last look and who would I
want to spend my last moments list so
today that's exactly what I am sharing
with you and hopefully it inspires you
to ask yourself those questions you know
what would you do if you need the end of
the world was coming
number one foundation would have to be
their home 10 Idol 24-hour it's an oldie
but a favorite of mine I don't use it
that much but I know I love it after
that it will be the Kevin acquire and
concealer you guys know I've used this
for a very long time and it is very good
for a glamorous and intense look I'm
moving on to my brows I think a gel is
always gonna be the best I mean really
and I love Matt's Nick down to make my
brows pop and then go ahead and use my
normal concealer which will probably be
Estee Lauder Double Wear to just make
that nice and neat my favorite eyeshadow
is always something gold brown or bronze
and I love the mac warm neutrals palette
to achieve this look and I feel like
this palette you can basically do
everything from highlighting to Saul
King to everything with this palette you
don't need that many
and I just blend all my powder in I will
always do a winged eyeliner look because
it is my trademark and sometimes I just
add a little dot I think my favorite
mascara I don't have one I won't even
like my ultimate eyelashes have to be
the ideal I love to layer them up and
they are cheap and cheerful and looking
gorgeous my blush should be max fever
and I would go ahead and use Estee
Lauder Double Wear to contour as well
but lipliner will be Mac's chestnut or
night mauve and the lipstick would have
to be Ruby woo as well with a gorgeous
gloss over it yeah this would be my
trademark final look if I had to do it
moving on to my hair my favorite
hairstyle happens to be my husband's
favorite
tell me which is anytime my hair is out
of my face so right now I love just
doing our half up bun and I basically
wear hair extensions all the time till
the end of time definitely but I wear
them like just half way past my hair so
I have the front of my hair out which
makes it easier for me to do these kind
of half up hairdos and I use a headband
to kind of sleek it down and create cars
with the GHD which is a favor of mine as
well I took the bun down but I feel like
I should have kind of left it in but I
do really like this look at the moment I
feel kind of cute and yeah that is my
finished look so moving on to perfume it
old favorite is Britney Spears fantasy I
can't stand the smell of it now but it
always was something I liked when I was
younger and my favorite dress is this I
had this dress about 3 to 4 years now
and it still fits me lovely and it was
like my first like really expensive kind
of designer purchase bought it in
Singapore it's got great memories and I
love the way it fits it's always fit
like a glove and I paired with my lubes
I love a pair of boobs and this trusty
leather jacket you've been watching me
long enough you'll know that I've had
this jacket for like five years and you
never know if I ever needed to run for
my life
I need a leather jacket and my Nike
trainers of course this is not the most
fashionable look but if I knew it was
the end of the world then this is what
I'd wear whatever I felt like and
obviously I mentioned I've been inspired
by the new show you me and the
apocalypse coming out on sky1
and it just made me think like who would
I want to be it would be my friends and
my family and my loved ones and if
there's anything I love doing is
actually cooking I find cooking the
funnest thing and I don't do it as much
as I used to so I would get my friends
together and I would bake them like the
best cake ever and I'm not a baker but
if push comes to shove I'll bake it and
I actually ended up baking this amazing
okay let me not get carried away but it
was a really good chocolate cake okay it
was really nice the first time I've
actually made the chocolate cake and it
was good it tasted great
I would deaden prepare my favorite meal
which is basically okra stew with lots
of other things like onions and
mushrooms and tomatoes and chicken and
all that good stuff this makes my mouth
water I don't know how many of you guys
love opera
but I do this would easily be on my end
of the world foods to have a long side
of rice dish and I absolutely love red
Thai curry because it reminds her Thai
man which is one of my favorite places
to go to and I feel so nostalgic about
it and I love the flavors and I can kind
of cook up a mean red Thai curry with
some coconut milk in what about good
stuff tastes delicious
and I would love to just prepare the
meal of all meals with all my friends
and all my family and just bring them
around as we watch you know the end of
the world come and reminisce some good
times so check out my cake like it looks
amazing it's kind of falling apart but
the melted chocolate just holds
everything together so serving my
friends and family is like the best
feeling in the world there's nothing
like giving of yourself to people and at
the end this is what I would do you know
like just having fun times of other
people that you love so I hope this
video inspired you but also got you
thinking if you knew you had your last
few days to spend on the earth what
would you do what would be your look
well who would you spend time with and
what would you try to change before
those final hours arrived definitely
