thought I'd do a get ready with me video
to show you how I get ready to go to the
airport carrying little makeup bags with
me and I basically moisturize my face
purse as always and prime just started
using a new foundation which is this
Bobbi Brown and I absolutely love
applying this especially with a sponge
because it's really light and I feel
like the color is perfect and it's
actually more of a juvie foundation
which is a nice change for me
I conceal with the lighter concealer as
always just give me that nice and bright
eye effect I've got to groom these
eyebrows throw them in and just give
them a nice shape for eye shadow I know
quite basic and just go with the bond
and a bit of a brown you know me super
neutral a lot of the time
I do surprise them brush and I'm using a
sleep brush here and I use a line art
and a really neutral Nick shade as well
you guys know it's rare to see me with
my own hair as I do like hair extensions
but when I go on holiday I can't really
bear them so I stick with a clip-on pony
pony like you see here super useful to
create like a nice cute hairstyle with
just a little bit of a pouf at the front
and everything slicked back this is like
my trademark holiday look
my hair is quite fine so to get some
volume
I just fluff it around with my fingers
and push up this central pouf which
gives me a bit more shapes I've got
quite a small head so here's the look
without the phony Pony but I like a bit
of drama and here it gets clipped on and
you'll see how much of a difference it
makes you can see ad total glamour to
the look it's really cute um hair clip
which kind of add some metal and I
thought that looked really nice with the
pony for my Airport look it's really
simple I go for some big jewelry but
it's always a white tee and black jeans
just to be really comfortable so just to
add some color I'm carrying my red bag
which is from JustFab and it's a
humungous I can get everything into it
that I want on the plane and I'm also
wearing some coloured wedges so to top
it off I'm just wearing a jacket which
is from romwe comm it's absolutely
amazing and what I love about it is is
that it's so warm and I'm always worried
about being cold on the plane
guys that's my finish get ready with me
airport style video and if you guys want
to see more get ready with me videos
then let me know but for now I'm gonna
say bye from Chiang Mai and I will have
a what's in my airport bag video for you
guys in a few days see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
