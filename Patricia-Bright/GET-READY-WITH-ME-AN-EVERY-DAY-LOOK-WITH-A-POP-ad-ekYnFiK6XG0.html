had this again ready with me and when i
did this look i was like i feeling
myself I was really really fitting
myself because I feel like I've won not
warm red lipstick in a really long time
and sometimes there's nothing like going
back to your simple like your simple
look I kind of came back to like my
London edgy look you know a bit a little
bit of white bit of red BAM Bob's your
uncle but what I really wanted to let
you know is about the most amazing
opportunity that is happening thanks to
Rimmel London who I am working in
collaboration with and they have opened
up this amazing opportunity and when I
heard about it I wanted to be involved
so that my subscribers had the
opportunity to basically be part of this
they are looking for the next biggest
blogger blogger who's got a passion for
beauty and makeup and I know there are
so many of you out there who don't
necessarily get the chance to be seen or
have that experience or that exposure
and that's basically what they want to
do there's a three day trip to London
obviously all expenses are paid you'll
get to see some iconic attractions and
what you'll be doing is creating a video
you will be coming to work with YouTube
experts the Rimmel London team and
you'll get to meet and hang with a
retailer who will probably be giving you
some amazing inspiration and I don't
know if you are not excited by that but
I'm excited at thought that it sounds
absolutely amazing and I'm not gonna lie
it's so easy to enter that I know that
competition can be fierce but I know my
guys can definitely you know potentially
be the winners I know how hard you guys
work out then how passionate you are as
well all you basically have to do is
create a look good okay look that's
iconic a London look or whatever you
feel good upload it to your Instagram in
your Twitter just use the hashtag the
London look UK and you can also upload
your image
to the room one month and website as
well and then they'll be or we're not
fit to just get this opportunity so I
don't know about you but if you are
passionate about UT make up may be
trying to get some more exposure also
would love to meet and work with Rita
Ora this is definitely for you so I like
all the details in the description bar
below make sure you do check it out I
would love for one of my subscribers to
win this opportunity there's a few other
people talking about it but come on girl
but and I hope you guys enter and I hope
you enjoy this video as well a lot of
feeling as friend you know this new year
and I'll flag in already so guys thanks
for watching I'll see you later bye I'm
starting off with the remote
makeup primer and I loved it it's got
SPF in it and gives me a really matte
finish for my makeup I might go ahead
and do my brows and you guys know I
actually love a gel over a pencil to
fill my brows in after that I'm going in
with a la girl Pro concealer which is a
cheapy concealer I really like it the
way it defines at my brows and also can
be used to highlight I have been using
this foundation as of late I really do
like the color and I find that it blends
in nicely apologies for the color grade
it's just that my filming was really
bright so I just had to kind of adjust
it but it'll sort itself out later I'll
go ahead and conceal again and highlight
and I like to do this just to create
lots of different shape for my face and
make me look a little bit more defined
so I go ahead and use a darker
foundation to contour this is my
favorite way definitely to contour and
then for my eyes I've been loving this I
love a bronzy and gold color I feel like
it really does suit me and it just pops
especially moving a little bit of gold
on the lid as well as in my tear duct
just to shine
this quad is another really amazing
remark on and it just adds some warmth
I love the Browns and the purples just
to you know just make me pop a little
more
and I'm actually in love with this
liquid eyeliner that she gives you the
most defined line and it comes out super
dark and it's easy to use this is
literally a favorite of mine at the
moment I then go ahead with a black
waterproof eyeliner as well she says
some definition and I'm using this
wonderfulness pirate as well just to
curb them in and just make them myself
I've got this illuminator which just
adds a touch of jus and brightness to my
face and kind of just highlights and
then go ahead and add my lashes I add a
liner and I'm using this gorgeous bright
red which has an orange tin and that is
basically my finished look quick and
easy moving on to my hair you know I
keep it simple I've got these light
highlights at the end I'm just using a
chunky wand to just give me some loose
curls which is my go-to hairstyle which
I really feel is like my everyday look
which I really like and who doesn't like
a little bit of glitter to my existing
nail polish add some glitter and it just
adds a little bit of freshness I've got
my leather jacket on a bit of perfume
and that is amazing ready look so guys I
hope you enjoyed that and I will catch
you later welcome back to my channel and
Happy New Year this is my first video of
the year and I wanted to make it a
poignant one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
