wedding edition I went to Italy to
celebrate my cousin's wedding I thought
I'd share with you my limit so starting
off I am using a primer and this is
professional for benefit this is great
if you have like oily skin like I do and
if you've maybe got an event to go to
for a long time and then move on to
using my NARS foundation which I've been
using so so much like it's in my main
foundation set right about now and then
I go ahead and do my brows and I always
use a gel to do my brows this is max sit
down which I really like to give me a
nice sharp finish to make sure my brows
are nice and long I always use the
concealer around them to me in the mouth
and this is one from Bobby Brown my
concealer always remains the same and it
is the double wear same place concealer
I love it so it's just so easy to apply
and really does conceal everything I use
it to highlight as well I also like to
contour with a liquid foundation and
this is also the Double Wear in just a
dark color and then I go ahead and kind
of bake my makeup I'm gonna do a video
on makeup baking very very soon but I'm
using the bare my powders just to set
everything and I have this gorgeous quad
from Tarte and it's lychee my favorite
kind of caramel screen anything bronzy
and burnt red is gorgeous which is what
I chose to wear on my eyes go ahead I'm
lining my eyes with the ICO liners
I love these they're very vain and it
give you a really strong and dark line
and then using my NARS and mascara just
on my little - no lashes so I highlight
actually with an eyeshadow and this is
just the gold from the neutral pirate
from Sephora and I'm using flushed from
sneak on my Chi
line my lips this is actually a Kiko
liner in 513 not 9-ball I really like
this liner and I just use this kind of
cheapy gloss on top of it but I think I
ended up changing economy actual day but
this is still pretty look my velour
lashes are my absolute favorites I have
a discount code in the description box
for you all these lashes are so sexy and
so flirty in a lasts for so long I go
ahead and brush my hair you guys see
every wearing this long barb or love as
people call it and it is straight but I
just go ahead and add curls in and I do
them really really messing me because I
don't want perfect card and I am using a
new me one here which is a nice little
color long I really like the size of
this attachment I've got here probably
takes me ages and I get really lazy when
going to the back as you can see and it
doesn't matter they're like imperfect
because I'm really just going to finger
them out so I always end up messing up
the back is always great to in this help
from a younger sister I still ended up
missing bits but you know I was able to
redo those a little bit later but that
is basically the finished look and I use
my fingers just to loosen everything out
so I'm trying to grow my nails back off
the damage from all the acrylics and I
love this product for little own being
is kind of new but it has no smell yet
there's no damage to your nails and it
can peel off and it dries in like a
minute this product is amazing I have a
coupon code in the description bar below
so you guys can check it out but I love
the finish and navies let my favorite
color at the moment as you can see my
jutsu is this gorgeous Navy jumpsuit it
is from warehouse and it was a
last-minute practice like the day before
I went to an event and I just love the
way this look I felt very like European
and stuff and it's just a really nice
relaxed fit this bag is some Azores it
can barely bit of bone in it but you
know what you don't need that much in
your bag at a wedding I took a really
beautiful I also have this necklace
which is also well and I just wore my
berry bear sandal which are from Topshop
that is my finished look guys but any of
you guys are looking for some wedding
inspiration I hope this gives you some
ideas so thanks for watching bye hi
