Beach Edition some of you guys know that
Ireland and I thought I just share with
you basically how I get ready to meet
there's nothing special but it might
just give you guys some ideas so here I
am their face and I find that it's
really dusty and humid everywhere so I
really give my face a good cleanse and I
have the clinic anti blemish solution
they basically cleanse my face I use the
clarifying lotion to basically just get
all the grime out of my pores and I also
use their moisturiser which is all free
because really you can look very greasy
on the beach so next is my sunscreen
it's imperative and I'm using the
Neutrogena it's actually like back to 85
and it's really really good but it can
be a bit oily and make you look a little
bit blue so to combat that I do use a
loose mineral powder and I literally
just give myself a light dusting so
nobody wants ashy blue lips on the beach
so I use my EOS lip-balm and I just put
that on I do like my lips sometimes
I'm doing but I just put this on to is
just protect my lips and then I add a
little I love this one from naked it is
the rules of Bursa fog they just give me
a nice natural look they know what's
going on with my eyes where and yeah I
feel it my brows yeah you know it
doesn't matter and it just gives me that
kind of finished look without having to
put on foundation and a full face and
this might be if I know that I'm not
going in the water and I will do a light
really light touches often see that
under my eyes to make them look brighter
and when I do wear mascara I try to keep
it waterproof obviously so guys that is
my super quick beach face that's done so
moving on to my hair I am wearing curly
hair extensions which up from Mercy's
hair I will actually put a link in the
description bar below but I wanted
something a little bit different mid
words in my holiday because I knew that
no effortless curls look great on the
beach and that's what I have with Z but
I can get really dry on the beach and
exposed to the Sun so I always put some
leave-in conditioner on my hair
extension or even just straight-up
conditioner which I rinse when I get
back in from the beach and actually it's
kind of like the treatment but that's my
finished red hair look finger detangle
and that's basically it
so my bikini is from River Island and I
usually just wear shorts if I know that
I'm not going for a swim but I keep the
bikini top on so to avoid burning
obviously sunscreen is the mass I just
use one from amber so layer I believe
it's like factor 30 I also tried to use
some insect repellent as well and
I just cover up with the kimonos and if
I'm gonna be around loads of people and
I'm just carrying my JustFab sidedness
did bring a beach bag but this has been
really really cool and easy to carry
along there guys I really hope you
enjoyed and make sure you are following
me on my Instagram and Twitter Facebook
I have done so many postings from my
holidays over there and even on my blog
which is your bright dot co dot uk' so
guys I really hope to see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
