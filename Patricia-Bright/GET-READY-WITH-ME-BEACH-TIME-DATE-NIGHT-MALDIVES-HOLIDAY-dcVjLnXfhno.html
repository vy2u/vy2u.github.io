and it's kind of Beach Holiday Edition I
stayed on the most gorgeous Rigali
island and I think it was literally
paradise from you know seeing dolphins
in the world to like the most gorgeous
food I had the most amazing time and I
just wanted to share some bit and
obviously do it getting at me I kind of
got a day-and-night look for you so
obviously on the beach sunscreen is
essential I'm using my Paula's Choice
fluid M sunscreen I love this it's a
really nice sheer sunscreen and then you
know to avoid oiliness I am putting a
primer on but I'm not gonna really wear
makeup especially not in the day I like
to conceal because I do have dark
circles and I feel like concealing is
that the least you should be doing like
when you're leaving the house and then
if you haven't noticed I actually have
individual false eyelash extensions I
did this just before I went so that I
wouldn't have to wear falsies I
absolutely love these I'll link where I
did it in the description bar below and
for me my brows have to be done
especially because they are just on
crafts right now and they just need
taming and I just did my brows as
you
when I wear very little makeup like this
I like to go board on my lips I'm using
my cloth and I'm using a color I think
it's called naked vomit buxom finally
I'm just dusting off with a bit of
translucent powder that's a bit white
but it definitely just melts in
wavy hair extensions are crazy in
humidity like this so I just leave it
and just add a serum to tame it so he
stayed in this most amazing over the
water
Villa I would definitely recommend this
place if you guys are living on
honeymoon or just wanted a taste of
paradise and white outfit I think the
majority of it was misguided the top in
a short misguided my beau is actually
from other Outfitters and my sandals I
know I bought them somewhere online as
well as am I do not mean that makes me
very happy
so guys this is an evening look and it's
so hot but I know that it gets a little
bit cooler when you come around maybe
six seven so I'm just gonna prime my
face as normal as you're going for a
really nice dinner and just brush out my
eyelashes and do my brows as per usual
I'm concealing and highlighting with my
double legs and celo which I always use
and basically I got quite lazy and only
wanted to use my fingers while doing
makeup I actually kind of like the
results I get from doing that I applied
my foundation which is my NARS
foundation with my hand and just got it
blended all over my face
so I definitely found baking my makeup
was a must I used my bed my powders to
do that and I am using the really
gorgeous Tarte quad to just create a
kind of purple and bronzy look finally I
just use a liquid liner on my eyes as
always and then I just blend away or the
powders and add a little bit of contour
to my nose this is the S Lauder Double
Wear in a darker color and even on the
eyelash extensions I can wear mascara
but I regret doing that now I probably
wouldn't do that again so I'm just
highlighting with a gold from map and
then I'm adding on my flushed blush
which is a favor of mine so my lips I'm
using a combination of charlotte
Aubrey's unleash me and sweet the letter
which are really gorgeous glosses and it
just makes my lips look extra party that
is my finished look actually you had to
struggle to straighten out this hair but
obviously it's very humid and honestly
straight hair just wouldn't last being
out there but I did like these finish
results so this is just a view of my
over the water Villa from my outfit I
wore this one piece from MBD which I got
from evolved clothing I hope to love it
it's just a gorgeous one piece you don't
have to wear with a bra and then I wore
the same sandals
so guys that is my get ready with me
holiday edition I'm going to lick
everything in the description bar below
videos are back to normal
from hopefully Tuesday I'm going to be
uploading on Tuesdays Thursdays and
Sundays to keep an eye out but in the
meantime you can catch me on my social
media so thanks for watching guys bye
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
