different
my hair is number one long again and
it's looking a little bit pink I got
really bored of the short hair I'm sorry
guys I hope I haven't found you but
today I have a year's eve slash like
holiday season glamorous look and I was
really inspired by the Beyonce pretty
hearts videos she had the side parts at
the loose waves nude lips and a smoky
eye and I was like she looks so gorgeous
and I would absolutely love to just
recreate that look and I wanna just
share a quick like thing with you guys I
don't know if you guys realize but I've
been feeling quite self-conscious
actually if the past few weeks just
about myself about how I looked and how
I felt and I just didn't feel very good
about myself and I wanted to share that
you know what I think it happens to
everyone and you know I want to say we
all go through these kind of things and
I really felt motivated honestly by
Beyonce cuz when she's like I wake up
flowers know you guys sometimes have
that confidence and this feel like you
know what I'm amazing I'm beautiful and
I'm amazing despite not you know meeting
a particular standard you wake up and
you're beautiful and I just felt like
saying and sharing how I've been going
for and maybe it helped some of you guys
out there who may also go through that
stage or just not feeling very good
about yourself but remember your
flawless I hope you have an amazing
Christmas period don't eat too much and
while you're opening your presents and
just spending time with your friends and
family do think on those who may not
have that opportunity and just send some
love into the universe so guys thank you
for watching and I'll see you later bye
so let's get started so first things
that I start off with moisturizing my
face
and it's getting a bit cooler at my
skin's a little drier I'm filling in my
brows with the Charlotte Tilbury rock
and coal liner it's in the dark brown
and I just love it it's not meant to be
for brows but it looks so good
especially this and concealer and when
it's shaped perfectly so next I am
concealing under my eyes and I'm using
the hevener Quan skin enhancer in a
color 12 for those of you who are and I
love it because it's a great highlighter
under my eyes on the bridge of my nose
and on my forehead so the foundation I'm
using is the Make Up For Ever HD
foundation and I've said this a million
times but this is an amazing foundation
great color I'm just using my Mac
mineralized powder to set this so I'm
contouring with the sleek contour kit in
the dark I have been using it for
absolutely years and I'm also using a
sleek blush in hardline I think to add a
bit of color so on my eyes I'm using an
adult revita quad from Charlotte Tilbury
you guys know this is the favorite of
mine it's so easy there are four simple
steps from prime to enhance and smoke
and pop for those who aren't interesting
about with loads of different makeups
this is just a super easy
I'm also using the rockin Kohl pencil in
the dark brown just to smoke it out a
little bit more so I had a little
champagne to my inner tear duct and
highlight above my brow bone and because
I want like some really dark sexy smoky
eyes I'm going to add a black liner like
this and some liquid liner on the top as
well they also had a little bit more
black and smudge it out with my finger
and then to conceal anywhere where it's
a little bit messy
finally I top up with some mascara and
I'm gonna add some lashes which is a
process that used to hate but it's not
too bad now next I'm just going to line
my lips and I'm using the Mac in its
color called chestnut and then I'm using
the Charlotte Tilbury and seduction I
love this gloss it's so cute
so let's move on to the hair so as I'm
wearing a side part I basically want to
brush everything over to one side and
get it as neat as possible and I want to
try and sleep those energy is downed so
I'm adding some gel and I'm using my
slick brush to just smooth everything
looking quite sleek and trying to get
some volume at the top is quite
important so next I'm curling it I'm
sorry that I'm in a really awkward
position as my straightness don't
stretch much further than where they're
going but I just do some loose cars on
the side as you can see they're super
easy and I probably should put some
hairspray on that lifted bit but yeah
that's it
so I'm gonna go and get a change and
there you can see my hair is curly and
I'm just going to think of curl it out
and I found these hair chokes I went to
Westfield and they were selling them as
oh my gosh these are so cool it was
about 15 pounds but I really liked the
finish I got with it so I put these in
anything I noticed is that the chalk
gets everywhere please look at the
disgust on my face when I realize that
it was all over me so I've gone for my
broom bodycon dress which is from
misguided I love the shape of it and as
I have small boobies the top doesn't fit
me as well as it should but I'm sure his
palette Brown could be useful but guys
that is my quick holiday look and I hope
you enjoy it and have a Merry Christmas
I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
