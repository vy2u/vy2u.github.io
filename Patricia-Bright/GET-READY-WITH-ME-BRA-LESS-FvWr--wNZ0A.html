ready with me and it was just dinner
with the girls but I thought it was
quite cool I went braless and I really
wanted to show you how I did this this
hair I already have a tutorial on it so
do check out the video that I'm going to
link in the top bar so going on I just
apply my foundation as normal so this
many a time but I really do like this
foundation it is for Mac now you always
use a concealer which is two shades
lighter than my skin tone under my eyes
just to give me that lovely glow so many
people have been asking me to do eyebrow
tutorials but just watch I just use a
pencil and a spoolie and some concealer
and that's all I do and the great thing
about the concealer basically looks like
my eyebrows have been freshly tweezed
when they really haven't so I'm going
for a fairly pale eyeshadow and this is
called rice paper by Mac but I
absolutely love the way it looks
especially when I go in my crease of a
really dark brown and this is embarq
so the winged liner can never be missed
out I love it it just makes my eyes look
so much bigger and so much more sensual
get excited with the blush as always it
makes my fat head look a lot slimmer and
I just use a highlighting powder and
contour in a kind of C shape again it
kind of makes my face look a lot slimmer
so for some reason whenever I wear my
hair up I love going for red lipstick
obviously some lashes for some extra
drama and mascara to blend that all in
and my trusty blue eyeliner
and that is my finished makeup look so
now we're gonna move on to my outfit so
guys I used this product here to
basically give me the broadest look
because I'm wearing a backwards top and
it's really amazing some of you may have
seen this kind of thing before but today
this I had done so I was quite excited
like oh how's this gonna work of me so
they're really easy you basically pull
the plastic off and stick them on your
boobs and that's all you actually need
to do so this was outfit number 1 by I
thought I was gonna wear but I didn't
actually go for this but the whole
braless ring went really well with this
outfit and ended up choosing this really
gorgeous blacklist top which is Rosanna
and if you're not someone who's really
into showing your cleavage or your legs
the back is a really elegant part of the
body to feature just as Yugi Olaf I
added a few bits of accessories and a
black pleather skirt
and that is my finished look it's
flawless but I feel comfortable I must
say and you can see that you can't see
anything underneath this and it looks so
elegant without so many stripes at the
back so guys thanks for watching and
thank you so much for liking my previous
get ready with me videos keep liking and
I'll keep doing them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
