I've got a get ready with me it's
carnival edition because I went to the
carnival on Monday and I wanted to share
the beauty look that I did I got
everything online at very and it was
free next day delivery by the collect
class service so I really hope you enjoy
and I'm gonna be giving everything away
in this video so I really hope you tune
in to find out the details so the first
thing I applied was this illamasqua
matte primer which i've never used
before and trust me this was so great
like even though it was rainy and I was
kind of sweaty my makeup lasted the
whole day I also used the real technique
brushes to apply my foundation these are
on the site and you know what everyone
loves these they're very good brushes
and they really just give me a nice like
buff foundation look and I love the
angle brush as well it's great for
concealing
I
so next I found this NYX Naturals
palette I love it NYX is quite hard to
come across so when I found it I was
super excited its golds and browns and
neutrals and I just applied the gold
with my finger so simple and as you can
see it's kind of iridescent and I just
used a little bit of the brown in my
crease for a mild smokey eye but this
literally took me like ten seconds to do
it and that's how I love to do my makeup
to finish off the eyes I'm using a
liquid liner this is from Illamasqua
this is so jet black and too shiny it's
perfect and I'm also using the YSL
shocking mascara where I was like my
first mascara ever and it just gives me
such a false lash effect it's so
gorgeous
and when I link everything in the
description bar below so make sure you
check it out as well so something else
from NYX it's the setting mineral powder
this powder actually saved my makeup in
the rain and everything I still look for
us and I think it's due to this it's
nice and mattifying for the lips I'm
going for a bright red so I'm just
lining it first if like a brown liner
and then I'm just gonna go in with
another product from Illamasqua which is
this really nice bright red it's even
got a hint of orange in it as well which
I thought was perfect for Carnival and
then I'm just layering some gloss over
it
so as you can see we are very excited
but that is my finished makeup look very
simple very easy next I'm moving on to
the hair you guys know that I love GHD
and these mini straighteners are the one
like they're literally the one for those
of you who have short hair and or are
trying to blend your hair with hair
extensions like myself these just get my
little edgy is I'm a little peppercorns
perfectly and make straighten them out
and get everything to blend really
really well I just go around the
perimeter of my hair and then just brush
it in to blend and I knew it was raining
but I decided to put in a couple of cars
as well just around the edges really
lazily just a symmetric volume and sass
but that is basically my finished hair
so guys as mentioned I'm going to be
giving away everything in this video I
want you to let me know what your
carnival look would be and the one
that's most creative and inspiring is
gonna be my winner so I can't wait to
see what you do you can also enter on
Twitter by hashtagging my carnival look
and accent very as well so guys thanks
for watching and I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
