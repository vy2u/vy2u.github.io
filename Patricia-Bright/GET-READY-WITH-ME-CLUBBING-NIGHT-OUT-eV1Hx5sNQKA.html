get ready with me and this is a clubbing
look and outfit Oh
I start off with my foundation which is
the mac matchmaster in an 8.5 and I'm
using my Real Techniques brushes which
are amazing and I just dab this on my
face I love this foundation for a night
out because I don't really need to add
powder it's really mattifying I'm then
using a Mac Pro Longwear foundation in
an NW 40 as a concealer again I'm using
my Real Techniques brushes and this is a
smaller one which is great for applying
a smaller patch of the foundation
so when that's blended I just go ahead
and work on my brows I'm doing them a
little bit thinner than I used to do
them and I'm not using it as like a
concealer and I really prefer my
eyebrows like this they're a lot more
refined it's a foundation sorry a
concealer which is in NW 45 so new to my
skin tone so I just blend blend blend
and sometimes the fingers are the best
way so next I'm just going to contour
with my sleep dark kit and I just do
that the sides of my face and kind of in
a cset shape so at my temples as well
I'm also at my Bobbi Brown brush which
is in the nectar and I'm then adding my
Mac powder just because I'm going out so
it will be hot and this is a great way
to set everything so moving on to my
eyes I'm just going to prime using the
Urban Decay primer potion and on my lids
I'm going to use the NARS duo eyeshadow
and it's in the surabaya basically it's
kind of a burnt red Brown I really like
this you guys know I'm totally into my
neutrals
I'm then gonna use nas's Coconut Grove
in the quiz just kind of make it a
slightly smoky eye and spend some time
blending that ending on the line of the
liquid liner and then gonna use a gold
in my inner tear ducts just to add some
brightness to my eyes and that's me done
so moving on to the lips I'm going to
use a color called raisin by sleep I use
this all the time and it blends with
everything then I'm gonna move on to
using Revlon's lipstick which is in
sweet tart I love this and I'm just
topping out with some gloss so let's
move on to the hair and as you'll see
I've got a new weave and it's straight
it's not layered so it needs some
layering so what I do is basically cut
the section that I want a bit shorter
and I start snipping away Bailey I try
to do this at an angle I've been cutting
my hair for the longest so it might look
a bit haphazard but it always has a
great finish
I decided that I wanted the layers a
little bit shorter a little bit heavier
on the fringe so I go ahead and
feathered it a little bit further and
yes I did do this on my way out so
that's the finished result it's a bit
emo a bit choppy but I like that and
when it's got colors in it is perfect I
usually like to add loose curls and
layers with a straightener and it just
gives me a really nice finish so that's
what I'm doing here I just spend ages
teasing out with my fingers and that is
the finished look basically so orange is
fast becoming my favorite color and I
got this bodycon dress from style me
celeb I absolutely love this especially
for like a clubbing tonight it makes you
feel really silly you know
at the end of this video and because I
love you I'm going to leave you as some
awkward dance moves if you can spot your
signature move do let me know in the
