up and do a little get ready with me
video and as we're in the season of love
so I just start off by just giving my
face a little bit of moisture before I
apply my foundation which is the Make Up
For Ever HD foundation in the color 180
I love this because it basically matches
my skin tone perfectly it really doesn't
oxidize too much I'm sure some of you
know about my own favorite concealer is
the Kevin O Quan skin enhancer which is
a great concealer I use a color 12 under
my eyes and just to highlight some areas
of my face for my brows I use a dark
liner for mechanic I'm actually running
out of this I love this so much please
give me the perfect colored brows but I
brushed these in and I just conceal and
I use my finger to spread around so I
love glam eyes and the dolce vita set
from Charlotte Tilbury is my favorite
and it's so easy to apply it's got the
four steps it's kind of at the base it's
got pop and smoke there's just
everything that you need to get right
perfect
dramatic eye
they use the Loreal Superliner
to just do a nice winged cat eye which
is perfect for a night out
and I love using this matte finishing
powder it really does give you a great
matte finish on your foundation and
helps it last a lot longer as you can
see my contour kit from sleep gets a lot
of use I love it but I want to find an
alternative and border using the same
thing and I have this really nice loose
pigment powder which is for Mac which is
great for just highlighting you needs a
bit more I love this sleek palette it's
got some great pinks in it that I can
use as a blush oh your text only black
like you also in the master came up with
their own the one Valentine's collection
and I'm using the liner and lipstick
it's a beautiful bright red I have a
blog post on it so make sure you check
out my blog but I love it it's very
sensual and it's kind of a little bit
orange E as well I love it I also
finished off of the little bit of a
darker liner just to give my lips a
little bit more shape as well and then
I'm using their glass
so moving on to the hair I keep it
simple I'm wearing wavy hair extensions
I can't wait to tell you guys about that
but I love a side part I think it's like
the most flattering thing ever for me
and you know I use my lip brush make
those edges look good and my hair is
washed like just about a couple of hours
off also it's a little bit damp and I'm
just gonna move it to the side so that's
my hair and makeup done so for my outfit
as always I like to keep it really
simple I'm going for this really nice
strappy black dress which is from Zara
and I just love the back of it it's got
like a great crisscross and it's really
sexy and I'm just learning to be happy
with the body that I have
I am boobless basically and that's okay
sometimes I don't need to wear a bra
with this look do I and obviously you
got a smile right I'm using my Marc
Jacobs perfume and I put on this kimono
which is from a Topshop I just love the
blue I think it goes really well with
the red lipstick and my shoes are a new
pair of heels from office I love them
they're so sexy they've got so much toe
cleavage and love it and I'm wearing it
with my Chanel bag as well
so guys that is my finished look a
little back dress and a kimono but extra
coverage and one thing I learned from
doing this video or wearing this outfit
is just learning to embrace the body you
have and just wearing it with confidence
and if I would encourage anyone to do
anything it's to do just that so guys I
hope you enjoy and I will see you guys
later but make sure you check out my
blog Patricia bright code or ek I'll see
you guys later bye like you oh your text
