right now quite glamorous but I thought
I would do a video on the prom a prom
look I get rid of me imaginary prom and
told me you guys may not have known but
I never had a prom prom fee and I never
really had a prom I don't think I did
and I went to a classical as well and I
never kind of got dressed up or anything
like that so and I know it's prom season
I had a few and people come to me taking
do prom lot so this is a prom look for
you guys who hopefully prom hasn't
happened yet but this is an idea what my
dream from look would be I hope you
enjoyed this video and it's a bit weird
me doing it because no promise gone but
no I love this dress but absolutely love
this dress I wish I had the problem just
so I could wear it I might like crash my
cousin's from or something and just walk
in this you know just second come to the
brown dad it's a middle upper out oh
this dress I bought from a source it's
actually a forever unique dress it was
quite expensive
I know people spend money on their prom
outfit and my hair I recently had my
hair done at honey hand and it's really
gorgeous it's hair that I purchased
myself and it's there that I'll be
selling hopefully one day soon and they
just beautifully blow-dry the it gave it
that bouncy feeling so curling it like
this was so simple and yeah that's it
guys so I hope you enjoyed this video
and I'll see you later bye so guys first
of all if I was getting ready for prom
I'll get comfy and get my bestest
dressing gown on and get comfortable
I would then prime my face in
preparation of applying any makeup
next come my eyebrows and all I do is
use a spoolie and like a chocolate brown
pencil and add a little bit of concealer
to basically shape than that so I'm
using a pigment powder format because
they give a gorgeous glamorous
reflective glow and I have all the
details of what I'm using in the
description bar
so next I'm using this palette which is
from snoot and there's a gorgeous dark
purple which I would use in the crease
just to kind of give me that depth and
smokey eye without it being too smoky so
next I just add a bit of embark right in
the very corner just to add a bit more
depth so next is some gel eyeliner just
to give me a really defined line and
this is from Maybelline I'm using
another pigment which is actually from
Mac and it's called vanilla and it's
great on the inside corner and just
under the brow to highlight you guys
know I love blue eyeliner it's a great
way to add a bit of pop so next it's a
foundation I'm using under my eyes to
conceal which is a few shades lighter
than me but it's a great way to kind of
highlight all over and give myself that
slammer celebrity glow
so I know I look strange but all ideas
get my actual skin tone Foundation which
is a mac matchmaster z' in an 8.5 and
blend it all in setting with powder just
kind of ties it all in as well I do a
tad bit of contouring just round the
corners and on the cheek and I just add
a blush as well and obviously for prom
you've got to be glowing this is a
gorgeous highlighter from NARS lining
the lips makes such a difference on me
because I've got quite large lips that
are they need a bit more definition but
lining them and a gorgeous pink if the
gloss over it is just so prami I love it
and that's my makeup look
you guys know I'm really quite hair lazy
and this is a really quick way to get
glamorous curls in without having to
keep flexi rods in overnight I just use
my straighteners to kind of heat up my
hair add a little curl at the end and
then cut it with the flexi one by the
time they've cooled on one side the
other side is probably ready for you
while they're cooling you can get
changed like I did here I didn't end up
wearing this dress but you will see what
I wear in a moment but you can see that
the curly hair looks really glamorous
and it initially took less than 15
minutes so you guys know promised all
about the dress as well and I found this
gorgeous dress and lying on easels and
I've got some chicken billets as well to
just add a little boost you know Bob you
kind of need a quick tip if you want to
avoid getting makeup on at your new
dress then a t-shirt or a vest over your
head first hand is a great way to stop
any makeup getting on your dress so guys
this is my final look and obviously I
don't have you know much boobs or
anything so I think I can kind of get
away with a dress like this but
obviously if you need a bit more support
it might
suitable but I love it it's really
flattering and it's quite elegant at the
same time the deepest shades of crimson
guys I hope she enjoyed that video and
you get an idea of what my dream prom
look would be I honestly felt so
fabulous in this it was ridiculous but
thanks for watching and if you want more
get ready with me videos and thumbs up
so I have a few of mine I'm having the
most amount of fun right now so sad I
wish to add my out Brown problem in my
room you know Michael take me the brown
what's your prom dance deep deep doo-doo
think you guys are all right you have it
right yay did okay I got to go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
