today I'm gonna do a get ready with me
autumn edition this is actually a look
that I've been wearing a lot the dress
I'm wearing is a dress that I was super
super love and just fine super
flattering and I've not been afraid to
wear a dress twice on the internet thing
imagine but um you know I'm just gonna
go ahead and show you my look you guys
know I'm not a pro makeup artist or
anything but I am an avid fan of the
good stuff so I'm going to just get
started oh and it's gonna be a chit chat
video as well because it might as well
be you know my phone always goes off
when I when I start filming no one calls
me Oh Texas me and then as soon as I put
the camera on is that Michaels actually
sending me his lunch because kids have
sandwiches today because I didn't make
him anything and he's calling it
struggle lunch if I ever show you the
picture this foundation was supposedly
the one-pump foundation but I'm gonna be
honest with you I don't really agree
with it it's an amazing and gorgeous
foundation but I generally use about
three pumps now maybe that's just kind
of a big head or maybe I like my
foundation a bit heavier but it's
definitely not a one pump wonder so I'm
just looking at my eyebrows and thinking
that they're looking as picky as ever so
much you're just gonna tweeze their
heads I've got underneath and then I'm
gonna do them and then come back to you
because I was a sight Patricia why do
your eyebrows look so overgrown
seriously and I don't use to get them
like threaded and stuff I don't do that
anymore I've been trying to grow them
out but you don't want them looking like
wild beasts like honestly like this is
disrespectful so I'll be back for my
eyebrow gel I'm using Mac's a dip down
and I always use this I do love to use a
gel when I'm doing my brows
then go ahead and use my concealer which
is the double wear from Estee Lauder I'm
just going to neaten up my brows
actually just timed how long my brows
just took me they actually took me four
minutes which on the scheme of things is
isn't that long but it's kind of a long
time to spend on just the brows and I'm
gonna go ahead with my concealer I've
tried to get a little bit neater when it
comes to applying my makeup so that I
get better results and of course I'm not
a pro but I'm someone who you know likes
to improve and develop myself and I'm
just contouring with my Estee Lauder
Double Wear stay in place and this is
the rich mahogany its foundation and I
really like contouring the foundation I
feel like it just looks more natural and
could be blending in a lot better so
that's quite a strong contour for me
usually but I just thought why not go in
and do that one of the things I've told
you I really love to use is actually
it's my Bobbi Brown eyebrow kit I love
the color mahogany and I find it's a
really nice contour powder and I blend
that with my with my blush which is from
Mac I'm also going to use my Bobbi Brown
brightening kit as well which it's got
some really nice like highlights and
stuff to give me a nice strobe you look
I'm gonna just put a little bit powder
on I'm gonna use my Ben Nye powders and
oh gosh it just went a little bit wild
but why I love this is you can just dash
it it will just disintegrate and I think
and put that on underneath my eyes a
little bit just to set it
and I do like this I know some people
think it comes out a bit wide but if you
want it to look less white you just have
to dust off more and I'm also going to
use my Mac loose powder in deep dark so
on my eyes I've been using my Kat Von D
eye contour palette it's a matte palette
and I really really like it
and I don't usually wear eyeshadow
primers but I am going to use the Urban
Decay primer because it really just
helped it will to show or to show up a
little bit more and I'd love to know
what kind of videos you guys would love
to see more on this channel I know
people really do enjoy vlogs and stuff
but I'm actually quite a private person
I say that but I put myself on the
Internet
but I'm relatively a private person I'm
just going to use this side of the
palette on my eyes I love this on my lid
and then I use this in my crease yeah
I'm actually quite a private person so I
finally log in nowadays a little bit
hard because I feel like you could give
so much but I don't want to give
everything away but I love watching
people's logs I feel like you know it's
quite hard you have to just have that
balance of how much more can you give
then I'm going to go in with this color
it's kind of like a purple I don't
really like this brush this is also
either the lux definer brush but it's
actually quite spiky I'm just gonna
change my brush and go for something a
little bit smaller to add the darker
Brown
and I'm just going to use a fluffy brush
to just make it all look a little bit
more blended so that's a super matte
look but what I usually use is my Mac
palette if I can find it my Mac worn
niche was palette and I just add a
little bit of gold and stuff into my
tinder just to make it look a little bit
brighter does this warm neutrals palette
which is like fave and I just add that
along my waterline then I'm just going
to line my eyes with my matte liquid
liner which is from Topshop from the
scarf that I'm really loving at the
moment is the old ultra length mascara
from Tom Ford it's actually really
really good and I don't really talk
about mascara that much but this one
just makes such a big difference to my
eyelashes honestly I love it so moving
onto my lips lots of people ask me about
what I was wearing and it's this color
from in the mascot I don't actually know
what this color is it's gonna be it
wasn't my favorite so I still don't know
what the color is and it's kind of my
cup burn all right and for me cuz of the
shape of my lips I usually use more than
one color I never just go with one color
ever
so in the middle I went for Charlotte
Tilbury is very Victoria which is
actually like a map nudey pink and then
I've got the Illamasqua color and then
I've used black ops dark brown liner of
the outside to make the lips finally I'm
going to put on my eyelashes now what I
wanted to show you guys is you know this
is our doll lashes demi whispies for
2.29 this is our doll lashes demi
whispies for $5.99 so from if you go to
booths they sell them for like double
the price then if you go to say like the
corner shop if you go to about the shops
in light you have the ghetto so I go and
I basically not the necessary get it but
if you go to like the ends of you go to
like the Asian shops and stuff you're
able to get the odds-on lashes for much
cheaper because I've been buying our
doll lashes for like four years
there were $1.99 ok this is my look
without lashes and then I put my lashes
on and then you'll be able to see so
guys that is my makeup part of this get
ready with me I'm gonna do my hair and I
always tell people that I am hair lazy
I'm not something to like to spend hours
and hours on fixing my weave and all
that kind of stuff I'm all about hair
that you can make look good in five
minutes like I don't need an hour and a
half to do my hair okay I tried to do
that so I'm just gonna plug in my
curling wand here I kind of on my ghd's
I'm just gonna add some loose waves to
my hair and it should usually take me
about five minutes
and I will say these hair extensions on
exactly knew I've had these for coming
onto a year I didn't oh all on and off
for over a year now
so I know they don't look perfect but I
really love it
they're older my hair extensions go they
kind of get nicer in my opinion so
that's it it's a little bit bouffant a
it's a little bit Buffon but I kind of
like it when it like settles down and
goes down a little low and stuff but can
I have a look gladly YouTube right then
put my dress on so you can see my full
look so this is an outfit that I've been
wanting to show you guys two ages you've
may have seen it on my Instagram as well
I'm just loving this kind of color as
well for this season I feel like it
looks so so so nice I feel like it
really suits me and it's just kind of a
little bit of fun I am wearing a vest
but usually I'll just work with a bra
but it is looking all kinds of let's
boobie ish right now but I'm going to
stand up so you guys can see what this
whole outfit looks like and I do have to
wear like control pants and stuff to
just suck everything in and make it look
nice and tight because it is very very
fitted but it's got this mesh bit on the
top here and then it's got just this
panel bit so I'm gonna stand back so
that you guys can see the whole outfit
yes it is a little bit boobie it is very
sexy but I do really really like this is
what it looks like from the front and
from the side I think there's something
about the mesh that just looks super
super cute and it kind of makes me look
like I've got always for those of you
who don't know I don't really have a
waist full stop I'm definitely quite
boxy when it comes to the front but yeah
that's super cute
hey guys welcome to my channel I am a
bare-faced because I'm about to do a
makeup tutorial it's gonna be an
affordable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
