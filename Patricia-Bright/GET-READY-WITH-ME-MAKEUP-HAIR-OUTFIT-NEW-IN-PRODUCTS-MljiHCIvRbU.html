going to do a quick get ready of me it's
basically this look that I've got here
and what I've done is I've used products
that I haven't used before the
foundation I have used before but
basically everything else is a little
bit new and I thought like I wanted to
start doing I can new in get ready with
me because I receive so many products
but half of them I just don't use or
they just get left for a really long
time until I need something new I feel
like it's kind of nice to just show you
guys what I do have and what I actually
think of them and when they're on my
face so that's what I've done today and
I do have a full blown outfit but I'll
show you that in a lookbook I'm going to
do like next week or the week after so
keep your eyes peeled for that but in
the meantime just enjoy the video I've
got everything for my hair details to my
clothing details to everything details
listed in the description bar below and
I will catch you guys later again I just
wanted to say thank you so much for the
love on my last video everyone's been so
supportive recently I'm just like word
up in emotion but thank you guys so much
I truly appreciate it so guys I will
catch you on the flipside if we're not
throwing me on my Instagram all did if
you're not following me on my Instagram
and my Twitter I don't really use
Facebook involve in order to do but I do
use my snapchat everyday then make sure
you do and I will see you later thanks
for watching guys bye the first thing
I'm using is the mask foundation this
isn't new and I've been using this for a
very long time because I love it but the
brush is new in don't you love the way a
fresh new brush looks how amazing is
that this brush is the perfecting
polishing brush from YSL it's kind of
like amazing to just dip a brush into a
foundation and it goes from beautiful
white to make brown sad times and I love
this foundation especially in the winter
because I find that it's a little warmer
and it adds a lot more color to my skin
kind of just makes it look a little bit
more Julie and golden so my brow pencil
isn't new it's a Tarte pencil I can't
remember what
because all the details of have rubbed
off but if I can find it I'll link it
and I absolutely love this pencil and
note loads of people have noticed my
brows and how different they look thank
you guys for making them effort I'm
going to go ahead and conceal with a new
concealer this is from Urban Decay and
it is the weightless complete coverage
concealer in the color dark golden I'm
Sonya's really funny about trying new
concealers especially because I'm trying
it for the first time on camera the kind
of looks good a bit different to normal
but let's see how it goes I'm firstly
going to do my brows then I'm going to
put it under my eyes and under my brows
it looks good a little lighter than I'd
normally go for and a little cooler
what also is that this concealer dries
quite quickly so you don't have a lot of
time to blend down that's the first
thing I've noticed but for the color I
like the color it works with my skin
tone actually I think this will make a
very nice summer concealer so this isn't
as yellow as my normal concealers it's a
bit more red but I'm kind of in the
middle so I can kind of go with this and
what I'll say is that this concealer is
a much more natural concealer than I'd
normally wear my kit really isn't giving
me that hardcore pop but it's probably
great for everyday or someone who
doesn't like a to xtreamer highlight but
because I do I'm just gonna apply a
little bit more I'm going to go ahead
and just use my Sacha powder which isn't
any powder but it's the one I use all
the time and really do like
now for my eyes I'm going to go ahead
and use this cord it's from Illamasqua
the annoying thing about illamasqua is
that they never put the details of the
product on the on the packaging it's so
annoying but this is this quad here it's
really nice neutrals it's a great bits
of Browns which you guys know I love I
haven't put a primer on because I've
just been lazy but I already feel like
the color is really good and I'm going
to go ahead with the darker Brown as a
bridge color I thought that wasn't going
to be dark enough but actually it is
interpret for an everyday basis and more
of a two color kind of go if I can just
use one cord I am good to go versus
using loads of different colors and
because I'm going to do glossy lips I
want to keep my eyes quite simple and
neutral I'm gonna go ahead and dust this
off now so the scar I'm going to use is
the false lash effect mascara from YSL
if you guys have watched me long enough
you know that this is the one of my
favorite mascaras from when I was like a
team because I used to steal it from my
mom like I still love this mascara and
this is a new and improved formula it
still has that smell that I used to have
which I should probably say fit but it
smells so good that's an expensive one I
remember thinking and I actually
remember buying this when I was like 18
like my first paycheck or do you guys
think of just the mascara alone
obviously I'm a lash gloss I do have to
put my lashes on
next I'm going to use this blush by free
palette which is from sleek and I love
sleek it's a drugstore product and this
colors at one of my favorites anyway
from right back in the day and I think
these are just really nice highlights
and everything as well we're not go too
heavy because my outfits all pink as
well and I'm going to go ahead and use
this one in the middle which is kind of
pinky but we'll juice the touch of
highlight next I'm going to go in with
these new lip paints which are from
Tarte they're really nice they're glossy
I'm loving goss's right now so yeah so I
usually apply my lip products as a
two-tone because I find that for my lip
shape it suits me a lot more so dark on
the outside and lighter on the inside so
that's basically my finish beauty look
now I'm going to go ahead and show you
how I revive my curly hair extension so
for my hair I usually just wet it and I
go ahead and apply a conditioner and I
leave the conditioner in and that gives
me a lot more curl definition and I just
use my fingers I don't really need to
use a brush and I will probably do this
every other day to really get cars that
look really nice and defined so guys
that's basically what it looks like when
I basically run water and conditioner
for it really easy to do you kind of
have to do it probably every other day
and then it kind of looks a little bit
solo but once it dries it won't look
like that so I really like wearing curly
hair at the moment I'm going to go ahead
and put my outfit on as well so guys
that is my complete and finished look as
mentioned I'm actually going to share
with you my look in a lookbook that's
coming but on my blog you'll probably be
able to see the pictures of this outfit
anyway so keep your eyes peeled for that
I'll link it in the description bar
below I really hoped you guys enjoyed
that video and I'll catch you on
Thursday M see you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
