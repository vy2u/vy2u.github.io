so yes I look different I've gone for
the Bob on my snapchat you guys have
been loving this look and I appreciate
all the love and sometimes it's nice
just to switch it off I took a little
bit of a weekend break and I felt like a
new person and it's crazy so I wanted to
do a get ready with me because everybody
was loving it and I mean it's one of my
favorite looks as well but I've ever
done I never ever ever done and I've
used products that are new and poppin
and I feel like there's so many products
that come on the market sometimes and
you never know if it's actually going to
be suitable if it's even worth any of
the height so I've got some of the items
from Anastasia Beverly Hills I've got
the modern renascence palette and
they've got the glow kit so a row knows
I'm going to show you how I use those
next up I have the new cushion
foundation from Lancome is the ten idol
in a cushion foundation it's a long
wearing formula and the coverage is
amazing and the shades work for me so
that is amazing I use color five and
just to highlight and stuff and I can
also use kind of six and I love it
because it also has these really good in
fills as well and finally I've got the
huda beauty liquid lipsticks which are
so popular right now and I'm going to be
changing my upload schedule as well so
I'll be uploading on Saturday mornings
on Tuesdays and sometimes on a Thursday
so guys that that is it I'm going to
stop waffling on and I'm going to show
you my outfit at the very end of the
video as well in the meantime enjoy and
I will catch you on Saturday morning
what the first thing I'm going to start
off with is the Lancome ten idol ultra
24 hour foundation and I think if you
guys have been watching me for long
enough you know that this foundation has
been one of my favorites for for
literally two two to three years ever
since they have the Lupita campaign as
like yes Thank You Lancome they've got
so many colors and this is color 13 this
at color is actually beautiful and
actually love the smell of this
foundation for my brows I am going in
with the NYX brow gel and I'm not going
to lie I'm not a huge fan of it
I've really been struggling to find
products I really like when it comes to
my eyebrows so any suggestions are
welcome I will say with eyebrows it's
all in the technique as well next I'm
just going to go in and conceal these
brows because they are looking kind of
crazy right now and I'm not even going
to lie my eyebrows need a lot of help at
the moment because I've been trying to
grow them out to get my perfect shape
and they're just they're just wild
they're just worldlings right now but
I've actually kind of been changing the
shape of my brows I feel like I'm always
changing the shape of my brows somebody
said that actually on my channel but
again
eyebrows frame the face and when your
eyebrows are rough you just need to make
them work with some concealer and two
product and make it look right alright
so this product is a new product and I'm
so excited about it
it is the new ten Idol cushion
foundation from Lancome so obviously I
love the normal foundation but this is
the cushion foundation and it comes in I
believe it comes in nine or nine shades
and for me I'm like oh because I've been
wanting to try cushion foundations for
the absolute longest and as you can see
it comes like this and another good
thing is that it also has got refillable
inserts so you don't need to get a whole
new one you can just get an infield I am
using color 5 right now but I'm going to
use this to basically highlight it's
super full coverage and it's also really
long wearing so I'm going to use it
under my eye to give me basically a
highlight and if you guys can see the
level of coverage is insane like the
color is like a really nice warm yellow
and I hate yellows that look ashy
this doesn't look ashy and I feel like
that's with the whole Lancome raid
especially when it comes to the the
darker color flawless didn't I'm going
to go in with some contour and I'm using
this color from bare minerals in called
cacoa I'm just going to do that down the
side of my nose and this is just a
really nice dark brown contour color
so that's going in my Sasha
to set under my eyes I don't feel like I
need lots of setting but I want to be
quite glamorous today all right so next
I am going in with the modern renascence
palette from Anastasia Beverly Hills
I believe this came out about a month
ago I used it quite a few times but I've
never done any tutorial on it and I'm a
big massive fan and I definitely think
it's worth the height I'm going to go
for a little bit of a glamorous orange
look today
you know when Patricia starts wearing
colour its own I will say the brush that
comes inside the eyeshadow palette isn't
it's not all that but I just use it for
now I'm being lazy I then went in with
the dark brown in the palette as well as
lined my eyes and added my lashes but
for some reason my camera cut that day
out like my lashes are on I feel like my
eyes are lacking a little bit of gold
I'm going to go back in with the modern
renascence palette and I'm going to use
this color here which is like a gold
called
Primavera I'm just gonna do it on the
inner corner of my eye which I basically
do with every makeup look okay so we're
sticking with Anastasia Beverly Hills
I'm gonna go in with the glow kit this
is the Sun dipped and go care I realized
that my highlights got to be a little
bit different to other people's because
when I highlight too high it doesn't
look good because I've got quite high
cheekbones it doesn't really suit me but
yeah I'm going to go with moonstone
mixes a bit of bronze
yeah definitely I need to highlight a
lot lower than lots of people and that
suits me so much more and as you can see
that glows that is genuinely glowing for
my blush I'm just going to go in with
sneaks palette which is a favorite of
mine for ages the color is demo rammer
and this is a morphe brush that you also
got from cult beauty but I really like I
feel like I can really pull this color
on without it looking crazy I'm not
going to lie I'm in love with the
highlight like it's it's just it's
pretty so finally I'm going to finish
off my face with the huge Beauty ups and
these are the liquid lipsticks and I
have about six of the colors I'm going
to give you my honest truth you really
don't need all of them because they're
very samey the darker colors such as
trophy wife famous and some of the ones
spice glow I'm nice and different but
the rest I feel like are just a same hue
of basically nude and I'm going to go in
with this nude called flirt which I
thought would look a lot lighter on my
skin but it actually doesn't so my women
of color out there you will definitely
be able to find a color that will suit
you
but for me I have to line my lips after
I put on colours like this otherwise I
feel like I look a little bit hmm
so I'm just going to go in with chestnut
and do that and I'm just going to go
ahead and turn it up a little bit more
and I'm actually going to go back in
with my cushion Foundation and an angle
brush they were doing this just gives my
lips a bit more of a 3d effect oh right
I'm not loving that
so next for my hair as you can see I
have this new like really short bob and
I'm loving it it's at Ju part with a
frontal but yeah because my hair is so
simple it's so easy to do and this is
why short hair is life like every time I
do short hair I'm like why do I ever go
back to long but you guys know what I'm
like I like to change it up all the time
but I basically just a brush and go and
just to like slip down my edges I use
this got to be spiking glue gel I'm
going to show you guys all about it if
you guys are ready to see my hair
secrets video give me a thumbs up and
I'll show you exactly what I do and
because I just have you know a bob and a
weave in I'm just gonna run the
straightness for it just one more time
just to give it a little bit more of a
bump in so those of you who are asking
about what extensions I wear think I've
said this a hundred times I wear why
hair which is my own brand of hair
extensions I just switch it up a lot but
this is basically the satin that was cut
into this hairstyle alongside a frontal
but yeah I wish I wore like short hair
more often I forget how easy is to live
my life so guys that is my finished look
using some of these hot and popping new
items I hope you guys like it
I feel like I'm so much more confident
in like knowing what look I like for
myself like I'm loving it when new
things do come out I'm usually going to
be drawn to the things that I know that
are going to suit me so yeah I'm
literally in love with this I'll show
you my outfit at the
and as well and yeah I will catch you
later as I mentioned I will be uploading
on Tuesdays Thursdays and Saturdays so
keep that in your schedule and be ready
so guys thank you for watching and I'll
see you later
