doing a New York style get ready of me I
was in New York for a couple of days
sadly I wasn't able to do the meetup
like I thought because I just didn't
have enough time and it was freezing
cold so hopefully I'll come back one day
and do like a proper one with a brand
but I thought I'd share the look that I
had over the weekend starting off with a
bare face thank you guys so much for all
the nice comments you have said about my
skin recently I'm glad you can see the
fruits of my labor but I use my Lancome
foundation it is in a color 13 I'd try
not to bring that much makeup with me
when I go away but this is like a staple
in my makeup collection
next I'm using my Bobbi Brown Casillas
the kulluk is called chestnut and I
mentioned that this is super super nice
I love the fact that it's just so easy
to blend and it really doesn't crease I
then go ahead and use a kabuki brush to
basically blend everything in moving
onto my brows my favorite trick is to
use a gel the gel that I'm using is from
Sigma but there are other gels and I use
an angle brush to basically fill them in
and give me a lot chunkier of a brow and
then I go ahead and add a little bit
more concealer to make that look a
little bit more new to us next I'm using
the lapel it nude which is from L'Oreal
this is a new planet which is absolutely
gorgeous I'm using the matte and brown
on my nips and then I'm using the darker
Brown in my crease and I went ahead and
just line my eyes with a liquid liner to
give me like a nice cat eye which is you
guys know it's my trademark look mascara
I'm using it's also from L'Oreal it's
the volume minion lash and my blush are
not actually added a bit of contour
which is just some dark brown and my
brush is called flamingo from smooth
it's a really nice pink that sits really
well and finally I'm lining my lips with
a brown pencil and I'm going in with
this gorgeous color it's called
persistence which is from Kevin a qualm
and my naked lip gloss so guys that is
my basic New York makeup look sadly I
forgot my straighteners at home sad to
do the hair that I had so moving on to
my first outfit I had a lot of meetings
I wanted to be really smart
my usual smart look is a polo neck and
some trousers these are for Sainsbury's
to what I loved about the trousers is
that they are a perfect fit and even
gorgeous
checked pattern on them
I also picked up this fleece-lined
jacket also from Sainsbury's - and it is
perfect in the New York cold however I
opted for a little bit of a warmer
outfit in the end so I went with jeans
kept on the polar net and this oversize
cocoon coat and it was so good and
protected me from that New York breeze
if you know about that let me know
because it's some arctic weather for
real but guys I hope you enjoyed that
little get reading with me
make sure you guys check out my blog
we've got more features on this look as
well as an amazing competition with
Sainsbury's - so I was catch you guys
later and thank you so much for watching
bye guys
hey guys so uh your head spinning face
technique of how much my head changes my
head changes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
