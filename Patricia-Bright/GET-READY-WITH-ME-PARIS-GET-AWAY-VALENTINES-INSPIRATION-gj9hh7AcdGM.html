getaway get ready with me I was in Paris
for a couple of days and I know that
it's the Valentine seasons I thought you
guys might enjoy this
so obviously I'm staying in a hotel and
I'm one of those people that you may I
wear this dressing gown I wear this in
the purse I love everything that they
give me in the hotel and I start with
just kind of giving my face a wash
give my teeth the brush and I will then
jump into the shower so moving on to my
face I don't bring all my products with
me but I do bring some key ones I'm
using my doctor not some moisturizer you
can see my brows aren't completely off
and I'm using my Giorgio Armani even a
silk foundation you guys know how I feel
about this foundation I'm just gonna
call it my second skin it's so so good
and gives me chewy finished and I'm
using my Bobbi Brown concealer this
isn't a color called chestnut and this
is not like the brightest concealer for
really dramatic look but it's just a
really good one that sets really well
and I can use that to kind of highlight
my entire face as well
so I then said that with a loose powder
this is one form of tart
I'll link it in the description bar
below but that just helps mattify
everything up for me and next it's on to
my brows I'm going to just fill them in
I do feel like brows take a really long
time now a day so I kind of rush you it
but you guys know I like to use a Mac
gel and an angle brush to kind of apply
air and like do some brush strokes as
well and I go ahead and conceal around
with the same Bobbi brow concealer so
usually I go a report this is the Dolce
Vita quad from and Charlotte Tilbury
it's one of my favorite ever and it's so
easy to just quickly apply the and the
colors are so nice and it's just a
really nice natural look in the hint of
birds
and I just do a winged liner because
that is like a trademark for me and
mascara I'm going for a bold red lip so
I'm using this dark brown liner first
and then I'm gonna go in with my red I
just like to use the liner to kind of
add a bit in shape to my lips and this
is the cut sake this is Ruby woo giving
me a nice red lip I love the finish of
this and then going in with a brown
contour powder just to give myself a
little bit more shape and definition I'm
doing that along my nose as well and
then my hair I have got a side part at
the moment and I'm basically going to
stick it all back because I haven't got
everything to make my hair perfect so
I'm like you know what pony tail it is
and I'm just taking the hair from the
side and just going to put it back in
one and I'm gonna leave a section at the
front out and that I will curl
but this is a super simple hairstyle
when I don't have the time to basically
turn all over or straighten all over I
just do this brush out the ponytail and
add one color in the site you guys know
I love to gel down these front hairs
nowadays I'm just using my normal gel
which is dark and lovely and a slick
brush to just smooth that all in and
around to make it a little bit neater so
that is my finished look really simple
and then I've got this two-piece outfit
from River Island I will link it in the
description bar below and I love all
these little chains and like Urban
Outfitters they do the best metal
jewelry I just paired it with my Chanel
bag as well now I'll be honest with you
it was ice-cold so I definitely needed a
coat but I wanted to wear this look just
so you guys can see it and I just felt
feminine and girly in it so honestly I
just wanted to make you guys a little
bit hungry with all these pastries
they're so good like Paris is amazing
for this kind of stuff and it is
definitely the city of romance I had a
great time just enjoying the sights and
the music right back
I talked through the look but because it
was ice-cold this is my oversized monkey
jacket but I put on just to make me feel
a little bit more comfortable but again
I put all my outfit details in the
description bar below and you can also

Patricia Bry and I have more pictures
and full coats so thank you so much for
watching and I'll see you guys later bye
today I am finally addressing all things
