sure some of us are thinking oh my gosh
what more than where for New Year's so I
thought I put together a few New Year's
outfits that I would be wearing and what
what I would wear this New Year's just
from some curves that I've got here so
I've been finding interesting at least
there's one or two things that you think
walk wear that outfit based on where you
might be going to for the New Year's
party so guys I hope you enjoy it and
I'll see you later bye there guys a
quick warning there's a lots of dancing
and prancing around this video I was
feeling myself like every girl does and
they get ready to go out to a party so
I'll get on and let you know more about
this outfit
what I'm wearing here is a white shirt
which is from H&amp;amp;M tucked in to a pair of
really glamorous sparkly glittery
sequiny leggings which are from Topshop
which I think are absolutely perfect for
New Year's party and wearing them with a
pair of ankle boots which are also from
Topshop which have these gorgeous cutout
on the sides
I was going to a more elegant affair I'd
probably wear like a nice maxi dress
that I've got here which is fun miss
Selfridges and I love the fact that it's
got this gorgeous cutout detailing in
the back just because that adds a little
flavor but it's gorgeous it's textured
and I absolutely love this dress
so this outfit here is a little bit more
dangerous a little bit more rocky and
I'm wearing this leather corset which is
from wrong neucom and I paired it with a
maxi knitted skirt and just to cover up
a little bit more also our most spoke
Jeffrey Campbell Hills just to add a bit
more edge to the look to make it a bit
more elegant I've added some downward
teasing cuz I don't like showing too
much as well I've just shown that this
is how I would wear it probably with a
Jackie or little throw underneath
so my next few looks are my favorite and
it's got to be a black dress every time
with some jewelry with some leather this
dress here it's prob Sawa and I actually
love the gold detailing on it I just
love this in a way it's great for my
figure
I think this look is a great party that
but also great for a dinner and a night
out another black dress which I
absolutely love it's from love clothing
comp and wearing it with a chunky chain
and I just love the rock style and how
elegant the back looks
enough body confidence great for the
figure but you could do some control
pounds so just hold in that stomach and
the behind and I'm just wearing it with
the nice Airport Hills
so here's a numbered black dress which
is absolutely covered in glitter
it's from Topshop you can see glitter
all over me it's so 80s I love this
again it's body con and I think it looks
great
so guys this is my final piece and my
absolute favorite and it's from Anna
Selfridges calm
so as you can see I'm definitely feeling
myself in this one but on a serious note
I think black dresses are so flattering
for all the rim of all sizes but just
some added sequins in the right place
can be creating the illusion of a
curvier figure or even a slimmer figure
like this dress this here Fitness dress
has got so much going on I just paired
it with a nice simple pair of heels so
guys I hope you enjoyed this video and I
really just wanted to get you into the
party spirit I like to have an amazing
New Year's keep it safe and have fun
