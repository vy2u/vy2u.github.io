ready with me video you guys know I love
doing these so I start off with using my
moisturizer and using the kills facial
moisturizer I love it and I've got this
really cool sunscreen which is kind of a
liquid I'm going to tell you all about
it and my favorites will soon but I
actually use a bit it doesn't leave a
blue cast or anything and then I finally
top off with a primer for Mac so I'm
applying my Lancome foundation and
actually I've become a big fan of
applying my foundation with just my hand
now those of my hands are clean and
washed obviously I feel that I get a
really smooth finish and it means that I
don't have to keep washing my brushes
basically I love it I also do the same
and I apply my concealer with my fingers
as well just under my eyes now let's
deal with these eyebrows of mine eye
pencil them in I do like my eyebrows to
look quite thick as of my eyebrows are
really naturally quite thin so I just
kind of pencil them in and can see as
well to make them look nice and defined
they had a bit of sleep contour kit just
at the corner of my nose and I do these
on my temples and my the shocks as well
so afters I'm just gonna set under my
eyes with some powder and just set the
rest of my makeup as well so on my eyes
I am using a bronze color from a
Maybelline quote that I have I'll try
and link it in the description bar below
but in my crease I'm using it nauseas Co
not grow I think this is a really nice
crease color and for deep skin tones
so after I've done that I line my eyes
with my lipid lineup this is one from an
urban decay I love it because it's kind
of like a flirt felt tip pen and it
works really really well and then go
ahead and add some mascara I'm also
having lashes as well but I'm not going
to show you how I do that because it
takes me apart next I'm lining my lips
with a dark red called V no it's for Mac
I love this as a lip color I'm using my
new Tom for lipstick finally it's a
really really pretty pretty nude I love
it and I am watching scandal and I think
I was just watching hot and what's her
name get it oh look at the confusion of
my face I couldn't believe it so some of
you might be thinking what the hell is
that your hair Patricia it's basically a
car pair of tights and I use it to
smooth my edges down at night and it
keeps it nice and fresh in the morning
as I really don't like using heat on my
hair but I do do it once
I don't really know what to do with my
hair
besides kind of brush it and it's just
the sides room so just make that work
and this is such a simple hair but in
the morning it's like thrush and go I
ever decide to put it behind my ears or
in fact and not be literally the biggest
decision so let this outfit pick in and
the web is getting quite nice you know
spring is in the air so I'm gonna go for
a little crop top and these amazing
jeans that I love I bought these in
Topshop and I think they're just so in
trend right now then this really cool
line only if it's palm tree in print or
like floral print but I love it it's
kind of a nice high waist as well
God knows what's on my elbows guys I'm
really sorry about that but then I'm
kind of feeling myself you can tell hey
check that ass secondhand embarrassment
I'm sure we all dogs home your feet
anyway yeah these are the trousers and I
put on this little like see-through
short as well so guys that is one get
ready give me video at you have a blog
post up on my blog for Tricia pride coat
