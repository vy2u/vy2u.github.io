doing a get ready with me videos summer
time edition we are on our summer
holiday and we've gone to the south of
France wearing the beautiful knees at an
amazing hotel and I really wanted to
share just a summer
get ready lovely video so I really hope
you enjoy so first things first all that
glitters is not gold and I do look crazy
in the mornings and yes I do bring my
turban on holiday with me yes but what I
do not doing it in the morning is
basically proving that fresh air and
just taking in where I am I must say
this place is absolutely gorgeous and
I'm so glad I finally made it and boo
jewel to all my friends and skarner's so
when it comes to my hotel room I tried
to keep it me I'm not always successful
but it's much easier to do everything I
also try to pull out my shoes and my
clothing it just makes it easy to get
ready in the morning
so only usually being a really small
makeup bag of me and sunscreen is
definitely essential for me as well as
my husband Mike but I love this one it's
from Craig Austin and it's a liquid
sunscreen but what I love is that is no
gray card and it doesn't get oily next I
like to use the makeup forever
it's the face and body foundation which
I just bought at Sephora in Paris it's
amazing it's so cool to proof and last
for the day if you guys want to see
Sephora one let me know I'm also just
adding a little bit of concealer which
is a font Kevin a corn and I just keep
my makeup super light when I'm on
holiday my brows I use the Bobbi Brown
kit and I love this again it's really
simple but you can build it up if you
want to
under my eyes I also add a touch more
concealer now don't worry about the
patchiness because I'm then going to use
my foundation brush to basically buff
everything in and then I'm gonna add
some powder as well to stop me from
getting all you I love this only cake
from Bobbi Brown again it's a great
illuminator I'm using this to highlight
but I'm also actually gonna put it on my
lids as well it's that good and it just
gives me an amazing glow and I'm just
using some blush from sleek as well I've
got a little bit of eczema on my eyelid
and the side of my mouth at the moment I
have no idea why but add some
moisturizer and they might go ahead and
use that gold highlighter and just a
touch of it or my need increase and then
I add a little bit of mascara I'm hungry
so before I do my nips I'm gonna have a
cross on because I'm oh so French and
this amazing movie I don't know where
it's wrong but it's delicious
I then fill in my lips with my brow
pencil over my brow bone so when it
pencil and it's from Mac and on my lips
I use the Charlotte Tilbury gloss in
seduction and it is my favorite nude
color lips but that is my finished
makeup look
for my hair I keep it super simple as
always you guys know me on my holidays I
just like a loose wave and just kind of
catch those edges there I actually
forgot my gel and stuff so I'm actually
using vo5 it's like for my husband's
hair but you know it actually no works
alright I then used my DHT straighteners
just to give me a little bit of a car
but it's stung so lazily and I just
brush it out with my fingers to give me
like a beachy wave that's my finished
makeup and hair we're now onto the
clothes I love to wear white when I'm
away and maxi dresses are so easy this
dress is from shee inside you might have
seen it in my last haul what I love
about it is the lace on the chest area
as well as the fact that it's all
creased so for those of you who don't
have an iron on holiday yeah you don't
need to iron this bad boy just wear
those creases with confidence yeah it's
so easy and it's just so flattering I
love it although it looks a little bit
like a pregnancy dress I am not pregnant
so guys that is my finished look it's a
look that I would wear probably just to
brunch or to get another class on than
the coffee somewhere but I absolutely
love this I hope you're having an
amazing summer and I'll see you very
soon I'm uploading every Sunday and
every Wednesday so make sure you tune in
I'll see you guys later and thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
