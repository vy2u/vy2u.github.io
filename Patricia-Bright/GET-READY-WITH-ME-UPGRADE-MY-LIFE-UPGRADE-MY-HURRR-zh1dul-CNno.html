Kraus delicious yeah I'm tired of it so
I'm going to show you exactly how I
might self upgrade my life so I'll be
honest with you it doesn't all start off
looking fabulous I look crazy sometimes
and I found that it was the way my
Christmas jumper up mid-july and that's
got to go the first thing I like to do
is get healthy and I've gotta say
goodbye to the Lindell chocolates and
hello to the salads and the healthy
eating and it no more carbs you all know
it a healthy lifestyle and then happy
lifestyle start from within so exercise
and healthy eating are basically the
obvious next steps
now we've upgraded in my life I'm
getting out there and doing what it is
they actually want to do I had the
chance to be on set I went to the shoot
the ghd's new launch of the former it
was such an amazing atmosphere the model
was gorgeous and for me I want to be in
the creative environment and I got to do
just that and finally it's out with the
old if it's old clothes it's old hair
tools it's old jewelry and old
boyfriends just get rid of that right
you're not crazy girl I'm gonna get rid
of all the old stuff and just start
afresh
now for my makeup I'm gonna try and keep
it as simple as I always do you guys
know that I love just gooey skin that
looks really really natural and
highlighting under my eyes
to kind of just make me look more awake
I keep my brows and my eyelids really
simple with a bit of chocolate brown in
the crease and a winged eyeliner as a
light dusting or bronzer some contour
and some blush to give me a bit more
shape and you know I love love lining my
lips now and that's me done now I know
that I wanted to achieve body and a
volume with my hair I love this look the
model on set was actually flawless and
they used an aura obviously this is the
new blow-dryer that's being launched and
I was like okay can I can I get this can
I get this down right the stylist and I
must say it's absolutely amazing
now the hairdryer isn't actually in
stores just yet but dhdx created a
really cool app that you guys can get an
exclusive waiting list and you
definitely want to get that because the
results are amazing

absolutely loving and it also makes me

bit and add a few curly flakes to add a
little effeminate but guys that is me a
basically done I literally love the
result and yeah I felt totally brand-new
and operated
