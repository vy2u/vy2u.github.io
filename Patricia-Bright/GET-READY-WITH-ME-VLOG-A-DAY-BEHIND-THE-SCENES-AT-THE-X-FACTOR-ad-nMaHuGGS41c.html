behind the scenes at x-factor get ready
with me thanks so very I was able to
basically spend the day there it was
amazing so first things first let me
show you what I did for my makeup and I
know what it's like behind the scenes
it's usually quite rush rush and it's
not about me being glamorous I basically
did my basic makeup with a little bit of
a touch so I've had my foundation and I
always focus on my brows if I know I'm
not gonna be doing anything majorly I go
ahead and conceal my face like a crazy
woman and I basically have concealer
absolutely everywhere after that I go
ahead and just blend that all in with a
sponge and I know sometimes it looks
concealer crazy but with my finger and
sponge it all blends nicely and if you
guys know me my favorite way to contour
is by using a liquid foundation I feel
like it looks a lot less harsh I go
ahead and set with my powder messily
because I was kind of rushing and then
I'm going for kind of like a gold and
smoky eye again I don't want my makeup
to be too heavy but I do my simple
liquid liner just to give myself a nice
look that kind of stands out as I had a
lot on my eyes I went for just a basic
nude lip gloss this is what I normally
do if I know that I'm gonna be wearing
heavier makeup
I added some lashes because you know I
don't go any of that lashes and that is
basically my finished look it's very
simple and casual because it's not about
me today
I thought I'd quickly show you my hair
I've been wearing this longer Bob which
you guys have seen and it's now a side
part by basically brush it out and just
bump the ends which is super simple so
for my outfit I've got a mini online
unboxing for you I got some items from
very KOAT UK obviously they are sending
me to the x-factor but I genuinely love
these guys check out these boots and
another thing that's amazing is that
they have free next day delivery by
their collector service and that's great
because you don't even have to wait to
collect your parcel you can even pick it
up from the local store so basically
pick my just casual daytime outfit as
well as some extra bits as well you guys
know I love an oversized jumper and like
some leather jeans and boots and I knew
that this is what I was just gonna wear
while I was there so moving on I found
myself at the x-factor studio feenin all
kinds of special and it felt very
surreal being in the judges hallway
this is basically where they do
behind-the-scenes stuff with the judges
and I got to see each and every one of
their rooms I also got to watch the
rehearsals of the different girls and
performers and again being in that
studio was kind of crazy because it's
much smaller than I thought and
obviously I was actually in the crowd
when no one was there after I went to
the styling area and you will not
believe what it actually looks like it
is actually crazy but there's so much
clothes there the guys gave me a chance
to basically pick some stuff off the
rail and take for myself so I decided
that I might as well change into
something a little bit nicer and I love
this I let detail jumper again it's from
Barry as well and I paired it with the
over-the-knee boots that I got so I had
a little bit of quiet time but everyone
does end up coming in the trailer and I
had a really great chance to chat to
Jemma who is the head stylist so Jemma
showed me around all the pieces that
they had showed me how they customized
items to make them a little bit more
standout and how they kind of come up
with creative briefs that are different
each week which I thought was amazing
also the trailer can get so packed just
all the contestants come in they're
always like vote for me use the app and
it's just absolutely amazing these guys
are so cool make sure you do check them
out and then going back into the hallway
when there isn't enough room in the
trailer people are getting changed
literally in the hallway it is crazy
people are singing and rehearsing but
it's such good fun the great thing is
you'll never know who you're gonna meet
and then I bumped into Harry hello and
then after that I basically went into
makeup which is why I feel the most
comfortable and there were so many
amazing products and people in there I
got to speak to the head makeup artist
as well just to get an idea what they
were doing so guys that was my mini get
ready with me and behind the scenes at
The X Factor I had an amazing time and
I'm very grateful to very for let me
have this experience so guys I hope you
enjoyed watching and I'll catch you
later I try and do these once or twice a
year and I haven't done one for a long</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
