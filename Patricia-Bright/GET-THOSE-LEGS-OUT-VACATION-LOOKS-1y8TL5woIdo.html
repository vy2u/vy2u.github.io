with you how I like to put my athletes
together for when I go on a vacation and
I'm off to Thailand I know I'm off to
Thailand again I loved it there and
we're going to Hong Kong as well but I
thought we need some sun sea and sand
and it's really close by and I really
can't wait to let you get my legs out
get the son of them and just yeah yeah
just enjoy it's been so rainy here and
the colors are really annoying and I am
working in collaboration with Venus on
this video because the first thing I
always want to do is get my legs looking
at perfect and I use the sugar very
sensitive razor is amazing it smells
great exponents and locks in moisture
via the moisture bars you actually don't
even need any shaving foam off anything
with it and it leaves you with silky
smooth legs love it the key items I
always have with me on holiday are
repelled denim shorts especially if
they're high-waisted because they look
great with a bikini like if you don't
want to walk around with your you know
bikini bottom or your bottom out you can
just find a pair of shorts and when
they're denim they look extra
fashionable but if you're gonna leave
your resort and you want to go out and
about or market on something thinking
that you throw on a t-shirt and you look
really good together
so the next thing is a jumpsuit I love a
jumpsuit especially a short one it
really does show off your legs and it's
so so flattering but they're great again
if you're going out and about and might
be on a bike or you might be going to do
some activities and the last thing you
want is like your skirt like then you up
in here
so jumpsuit is a great way to show off
your legs and keep your dignity
if you know you're going to be doing
anything crazy then
rarrrr pleat sky is my friend I
love pleated skirts they are so
flattering so you've got hit or behind
it kind of just has it all but makes you
look really feminine at the same time
and makes your legs look absolutely
gorgeous
then when it comes to the evening I love
to wear freakin dress you guys know this
I am a body corner Queen I love there
can't get enough especially when they're
just over the knee and you have just a
little bit of your sexy leg and you look
really classy
but if it's gonna be a crazy night and
you're gonna be dancing the night away
the last thing you want to think about
is dressy so tailored shorts are
beautiful and they're really on trend
you can dress them up with Hills or boy
you can dress them down with sandals
which is what I always do on holiday
so though I just wanted to share with
you how I think about preparing for us
going away on a vacation and I can't
wait I'm going to try and share as many
pictures and I'll try and vlog if I
possibly can and it's Venus also have a
really cool competition for you guys if
you want to win 500 pounds worth of
shopping vouchers then have a look in my
description bar below and all the
details will be there so good luck so
guys thank you so much watching and I'll
see you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
