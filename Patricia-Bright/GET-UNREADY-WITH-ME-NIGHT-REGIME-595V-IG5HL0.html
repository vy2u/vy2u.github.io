with me lots of you guys have been
asking me about my skincare and stuff so
I thought I'd show you in this video
right first thing I do when I get in is
basically get comfortable which means
taking off the shirt and just putting on
a house t-shirt we've all got one right
don't act like you don't and as you can
see face is full of makeup look at me a
crusty we'll need to get it all off I
take off my eyelashes
sometimes I check if I've lost them in
the process as well and I'd love to use
cleansing oil as quick easy but they
also prevent me from like having my skin
dried out too much but this is like just
when I get in on a weekday evening I
want very easy food so preheating the
oven are we gonna do like me old fish
and veggies but for now I'm snacking on
like watermelon and fruit it's a great
way to get a nice little sugar rush and
throw a little bit full in a healthy way
I love watermelon people I love it so
don't for Cod but dinner but basically
most times I just grow some chicken and
grill some meat quill some fish and put
some seasoning on it garlic ginger
parsley they're like my staples it's so
quick on the weekend and I just hung it
in the oven and then along side I might
cut up some vegetables and stuff and do
a quick stir fry again this is one of
the things as we help me to kind of trim
down lose a little bit my tummy in like
a really lazy way
I like to add a little bit of soy sauce
I can do reduce salt but I don't like
the taste of muscle it goes like this
and that's me done when it comes I'm at
dinner in the evenings so my recent skin
miracle is gonna come as a surprise you
guys have been asking me and the secret
is papaya see I've been using this for a
few months now and I found that it has
literally cleared my skin made it look
so much more even it's kind of
exfoliating it's a natural skin evening
now and it's so cheap I buy on eBay but
you can also get it from like Asian
supermarkets as well I need it on for
five minutes while I brush my teeth and
then I give it a rinse off and it gives
me such a good glow this is like the
cheapest product ever but yeah I love it
so I am using a ceramic but sometimes I
use my all those this is from Beauty I
love this because it is non oily
sometimes my skin's been so only this
summer but yeah that's great
I tried to keep my makeup organized and
my creams just so it's just quick and
easy to go to bed right and I'm wearing
an eye cream out yes
ain't nobody got time for wrinkles not
armed so yeah this is from Bobbi Brown I
love it and just some farm from the NYX
no one wants crusty lips in bed either
so finally I might wear my dressing-gown
and I always wear a head scarf because I
don't like hair in my face and it just
makes my hair look a lot neater in the
morning you should all wear a head scarf
you all want to look like this before we
go to it come on guys
and finally if I'm feeling fancy I might
read a book this is Malcolm Gladwell's
david-and-goliath but probably within
about 5-10 minutes
I'm yawning and it's time for bed but
that is my night time regime and
my favorite skincare product at the
moment so I hoped you enjoyed yes I did
come on it's still think about blood
money though I always say ski for girls
he seemed to know a lot of boys we did
know a couple of boys outside school
because right near our girls school
there was on a boys school yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
