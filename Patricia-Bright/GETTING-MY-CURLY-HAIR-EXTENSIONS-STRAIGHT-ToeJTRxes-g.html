on how to achieve poker straight hair so
you guys know that I've got patio
extensions which I actually straightened
out this week however you know
throughout the week it starts to wave
back up and stuff because it is you know
naturally curly hair but um you know
achieving straight hair with Korea is
really quite difficult unless you've got
the technique so all you need is a pair
of you know thin straight nerves or
you've got chunky ones you'll be okay
but thin straighteners are the best okay
you don't need you know a brush to just
brush through your hair and the most
essential tool is the thin tooth comb
because what we're gonna do is the comb
chase method which is the way to achieve
silky straight hair you can use any kind
of leave-in or you know hair
straightening serum I'm using Kerastase
elixir this is really really good if you
want like really good and shiny gorgeous
ends and it seems to help with the
straightening process however you don't
want to use too much as it is quite
expensive well I don't want you to much
cause it's really expensive and it can
be a bit thick so I just use like that
much wrap it together and I actually
just focus on the ends so you can see
that my hair is still kind of brownie
golden don't know if I still like the
color anymore we should work it out so
what you want to do is just brush your
hair out
let's see you can see that this has
started wave back up it was poker
straight originally sorry about the
lighting
this hair really does not shed at all
there's literally one hearing it I love
this hair any but that's not what I'm
talking about
right so what you want to do is take a
small section on what you're going to do
is you're going to use those thin tooth
comb and comb through then you're going
to hold that section of hair you're
going to get the brush the comb sorry
and as you go down you're going to hold
the comb and the straightness together
and go down Salone and make sure that
the straighteners are tight
I might as a poem chase method to get
silky straight hair with a lot of
movement you don't want to put a lot of
product any otherwise that will make it
heavy and streaky also you don't want to
use the comb after after the
straightness because it actually caused
your comb to over here and probably melt
so I'm going to keep doing this and show
you the rest
see start to see what it starts to look
like now you can compare that side to
that side so I'll go ahead and do that
and show you it looks like it there so
now I have nothing
both sides focus straight still with
lots of movement and body lovely and
then my fringe I do a little differently
because I want it to have a bit of a
kick to it so I do the comb chase method
once
Oh hmm just burnt myself out and then I
have a little curve to the straightness
you can see that
can you keep up with a poke straight
look I can calm it down just like that
and do my little you know one eye Aliya
impression which you can see like that
and it does look really pretty like that
but if you don't really like that kind
of really really sleek straight look
with the fringe the whole hair you want
to be sweet but you want more volume in
the top all you have to do is get your
comb and brush backwards into that
fringe
so now it doesn't look so you know
straight and sleek and it kind of looks
like you've got a lot more volume in the
front like that blows the wind yeah but
that's the way I would wear this kind of
focused rate hairstyle so guys that is
my tutorial and I hope you liked it bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
