Valentine's Day and romance period I
thought I would do a video on love and
like the cycle of not and apologies for
the lighting I'm sure it's going in and
out the Sun is cray-cray but I wanted to
like I worked through some of my old
videos and I worked at some of the
questions that I've been asked about
love and relationships and it seems that
there's definitely a cycle to love from
the beginning to the end to after so I
thought I would talk about the cycle of
love and the steps in between so the
first step is one how to tell if a guy
likes you and also if there's a guy new
that I can't get him to like you and
these are two parts if you want to tell
if a guy likes you there is this kind of
age-old tell that you know he'll be mean
to you and I think in the youngest ages
that's definitely the case that guys do
this kind of mean thing but I actually
realized growing older you're fine map
there I've got this is so obvious when
the guy likes you they want to be around
you they want to spend time with you
especially if you're not sure about it
and you're a bit standoffish you'll find
that guys just want to be around you and
let me tell you that guy's there for I
think personally think guys don't like
being around women who like on a regular
basis so if they really want to be with
you and hang on with you and go to the
shops with you come on the hint is
definitely there about his keen and it's
interested definitely if you want to get
a guy to like you I think you need to
get under the you know get out of the
box that you can do this this this and
this these steps to make him like you to
make him realize that he wants you but I
think that you'd be in a position where
there's an underlying feeling but maybe
there's never been an
move and I think that if you have been
someone who has been around a lot with
the guy then what you can do is to kind
of step out of the box if not step out
what's what step away from the
relationship or friendship and that will
give him the opportunity to realize that
he misses you and when they realize that
they miss you it's like doing like this
girl and I definitely feel like that
always happens but also some key things
is look your best but not in a false way
if you can't maintain it go be your self
and yeah that's definitely a key thing
be yourself because there is no way that
you can maintain the false personality
for the duration of a relationship and
you might find that relationships break
down and you cannot maintain that kind
of persona you've created like me
I'm cray-cray I'm weird which you would
and you know I just met people don't
move from the reunion you like it Alaska
yeah see you later so the next step is
basically when you realize you guys are
kind of you both like each other it's
always like that
okay so what happens next and some
people there's this whole kind of game
playing element like almost is hard to
get in the men and I just think that
games do not work do not try to play
games with a guy don't give everything
away but you know being false or trying
to be tricky tricky and not answering
these calls if you didn't answer your
call and once in a while but also be
easy as well it's not like where you
been either answer my phone calls
what are you living like it's cool chill
out be relaxed and just let things flow
and also don't lose yourself in the
process if it's only days like really do
spend time with your friends and do
separate things but also work out what
your joint fun activities are together
and just get to know each other a lot
more and that kind of stage when you
just want to kind of set up the
relationship
Byam you know
not more to dinner conversations I
remember when I least like when I
started dating right it was those five
our conversations you people know about
those with you could young people don't
talk anymore but phone calls were the
one phone bills what high the phone
bills are highly know that you know
there's getting to know each other and
just do that level of getting to know
each other and more than just from a
physical perspective and like the
butterflies perspective what you will
definitely have when you see the phone
ringing yeah you'll be like that so just
enjoy that and let that begin to happen
and just don't play let's just be real
and be so I'm presuming the next step is
you're after you've kind of been real
been easy learning how to work with each
other and got together that you're in
the fresh and new relationship which is
really fun really romantic doing nice
things for each other on a regular basis
but after maybe a few years or a year or
you know you could be two weeks that
kind of gets a bit dry or a bit lonely
or something like that and some people
thought how do you keep a relationship
fresh and all right women I think we
know in our mature relationship where
it's not I know there's this kind of
element of oh it's getting boring and I
really don't believe in a relationship
that's basically loves and being boring
because I believe love is actually a
choice so if I made a choice to love
then boredom will not bore them I love
but that's how I think so if you're
looking to keep the relationships
they're fresh
I really believe that love is the
foundation for for all of this and if
think if you make the choice to love
then your relationship will grow it may
not be as exciting or as giddy as it was
before but as long as love is there then
you'll be absolutely fine but you can
make special efforts for like special
nights out dinner
dressing up but not all the time if you
dress up all the time then it gets old
but you know here in their life that
kind of effort is really really good but
I think even sometimes it's just the the
saying I love you though is there
anything you want it's kind of catering
to the needs of your partner is a great
way to kind of keep that love and that
relationship fresh and alive so
unfortunately the next step in a lot of
relationships is the whole breaking up
and I do get marks a lot about how would
you deal with breakups and um yeah kinda
kind by having breakups but you know
they usually say you need to get
everyone relationship get under another
I do not agree with that if you do then
maybe that works for you but I think
it's a case of investing in yourself and
at that point in time trying to identify
what went wrong and why it didn't work
but they're not dwelling on that too
much okay yeah he was wrong or yeah you
were wrong
like get over it that's also mean but um
you can actually reflect on that but
reflecting is great because you pick up
your lessons and you take them into your
next relationship but dwelling on it is
not going to be useful the hurt the pain
and just try and let it go that if
something happened in that situation but
also kind of just try to forgive and
resting in the hope that something
better is literally always promised you
is always in store for you and actually
you're come to appreciate relationships
you've been in in the past in terms of
how much you grew and what you learnt
from them and what you actually want
from a relationship that is suitable for
you so that is what you should take it's
likely to endure
lessons of life to take from the
break-up for situations and that will
really help you in your next
relationship and always try to avoid
bringing your hang up to your
misconceptions and your negative
thoughts from a previous relationship
into a new relationship because it isn't
helpful and it isn't useful to your new
partner and just talking about things
and the friends and people will help as
well so finally the cycle begins again
and it's all about moving on moving on
and getting up getting yourself a new
man you don't necessarily need to rush
into doing this it's not right they've
got broken up with one guy on to the
next when you've found out who you are
and you're comfortable in yourself and
you're loving yourself and you feel like
you're ready I don't actually think
there's an active church you should be
doing I think all of a sudden things
when you're getting on with things will
fall into place like the more tivities
you're doing social event you're
attending someone kind of waters in is
that who has it so I wouldn't worry too
much about that but the more engaged you
are in life and living great to back to
knit there is that you're going to find
someone else who's living their life
just as hard as you're living yours and
you connect in your world tonight so
guys I hope you enjoyed this video it
was random but I thought you know it's
the season of love and I really wanted
to just kind of share my thoughts based
on what you guys have also requested or
for those of you who are in the cycle
who maybe haven't got anyone or on in
the relationship I wouldn't worry about
that too much darlings as I say when you
live in your life and being yourself
literally worlds will collide so get
excited at the thought of that and
having great valid
