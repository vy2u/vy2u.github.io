ready with me outfit of the night and
it's been a while since I've gone out as
a married woman I was like I'm gonna
dress up today gonna enjoy myself and be
fabulous it was my sister's birthday
and I thought I'll show you how I got
ready and what I did now first insert
like I like to use a face wife or
something on my face just to add that
moisture on again and like I had to go
off the works out no time for another
shower I'm a fan of the scout's brow the
scows brow is that chunky brow yes I
can't lie but I do blend it in and use a
concealer as well to kind of help make
them pop I list everything I'm using in
the description bar also I do have
periods of madness while doing my makeup
so then I apply my foundation which is
as matte foundation and I would just
kind of slather that on my face the
thicker the better it will sort itself
out a little later on now for my eye
shadow I always go from gold with a
brown in the crease to make my eyes look
a little bigger we've lost some of the
shots here as Widow up but I also like
adding blue eyeliner so I feel like it
makes my eyes pop and liquid liner as
well for that kind of a Cleopatra look
so I've only just got the gist of using
false eyelashes look at the
concentration on my face like it's
really hard to get on but once they are
on I think they make so much difference
to the eyes and as you can see and the
glue bore dry nice and clear then I add
my blush then I add my concealer my
contour and my highlight in the next
three steps
I love the Barbie pink look for the lips
some of you might hate it but I love it
and I use a lip pencil and then I use
Mac's Lady Gaga viva la glam and just
blend it in with my finger and then you
can see it kind of suits me more so now
my hair is kind of crazy kind of bushy
and I just need to brush it and
straighten it out layer by layer and get
the sections and decide what I'm gonna
do
for going out I'm definitely a fan of
black as I find it slimming and I just
find it elegant and this dress is from
ASOS and like I'm a fan of this new kind
of neckline I don't know what they call
it but I love it with some jewelry some
silver accessories some arm casts and I
think like it's a perfect look for me
for a night out so guys this is the
completed look I know I look a bit
awkward I'm not sure why my sister's
fills it with me and I've got some
sparkly shoes on as well just to add a
bit of pizzazz and this dress it's MIDI
if I didn't want to show too much so
guys let me know if you'd want to see
any more get ready with me videos and I
can look at doing some more because I'm
trying to get out of my house a lot more
so thanks for watching and don't forget
to check out my other videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
