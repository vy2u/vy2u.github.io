today's video is going to be a
combination of just a little channel
update and a mini vlog and I'm also
going to be hosting a giveaway on this
channel because it's about bloody time
I've done one again so I'm just going to
give you a quick update and let you know
what's happening on my channel so i
don't know if you guys remember from
previous videos I kind of seemed like i
have lost I've lost my mojo and i might
go video mataji let me know leave a
comment below if you want a video on
losing a mojo and getting it back and I
just felt like I just didn't feel like
myself I felt like I'd lost a lot of
personality and other like things are
just a bit drab with me but I'm building
that bekaert let new wardrobe and
everything and I've actually decided
shock horror to change my channel name
it will no longer be britpopprincess
because I feel like and coming to a
level of maturity well I am an old lady
basically but I just didn't feel like
princess in bodies who I am and you know
I'm like married with a home and a job
and all that kind of ritual stuff so I
really thought I'm going to just change
it to the name Patricia bright now my
real surname isn't bright or Oh bright
but I have an affinity to sunlight and
sunshine and brightness and going so I
thought Patricia bright would be ideal
please let me know if you guys and like
that i'll be doing a lot more videos
that are I don't know that just got a
bit more personality a bit more me in
them and my whole wardrobe is being
overhauled as we speak so that could be
a process but i will be doing a lot more
look books and stuff and going forward
because this is what i like passion on
this channel and i think that's about it
really and i'm going to have a video up
with my holiday stuff as well at some
point in time so on to the giveaway so
in light of my new channel my newfound
personality in mood I thought I would do
a giveaway to you guys and it's about
time that I've done one to be totally
honest with you and the first item I've
got is my ism is my is a michael kors
watch am I giving away one of these
before and you guys know I
two of these and I do love them I think
they're a staple watch in your watch
closet if you have a watch because it I
don't even have one but an for instance
I've got the gold I've got the one
that's rose gold silver and gold and I
gave away rose gold one previously so
this time i'm giving away a silver
michael kors watch and the links are not
taking out at this point in time this
isn't a designer bag or anything but I
believe that this is probably one of the
most popular bags I've ever had and it's
a zara bag and it's so popular because
its massive now what's not massive it's
a large enough bag and it's got three 3
zip compartments and two non zip
compartment and every time I carry this
bag people like oh my gosh where is that
bad from like literally every single
time and I've seen a few girls on
youtube with it Islam I just thought you
know this is classic and i love the
etching is 0 because it reminds me of my
Prada bag and it's such good quality
such good quality and when I saw this
one I knew instantly that this is what I
wanted to give away so there really
aren't any rules to this giveaway and
just leave a comment any comment you
