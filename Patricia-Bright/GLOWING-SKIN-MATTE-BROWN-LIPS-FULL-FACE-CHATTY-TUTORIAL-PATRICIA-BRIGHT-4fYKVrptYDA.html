back from a lovely holiday enjoying
myself in the sunshine I've caught
myself a little bit of a tan I'm feeling
very well rested and happy to be here
but today I wanted to do my current
favorite face which isn't what I was
wearing while I was away but prior to me
being way this was basically the look I
was sporting and everyone was so like
loving it and so nice and I would say
I'm not a makeup pro but and makeup
fanatic and you know I was I've always
been dissed on YouTube about like my
makeup not being very good and you know
what it's not been the best but it's
getting there okay time and patience
honey's time and patience so I'm going
to kind of do a current favorite face
and I'm going to try and do these
regularly because I don't you know
change up my look that much but when I
do it's like okay I'm going to show you
what I'm using I kind of got a different
set up is why I feel like I want a more
serene but a little bit more glamorous
set up for my makeup videos here and
there and it's a little bit easier for
me if I'll be honest with you I think
everything in the description bar below
so you know exactly what I'm using and I
think that's about it I'm looking at
changing my upload schedule as well so
I'm going to start uploading in the
morning on the weekend so it's either
gonna be Saturday or Sunday morning at
10:00 let me know what you guys think is
best and I'm going to stick to my
Thursday uploads as well but I know what
I like like on the weekend I like chill
in the morning you know get my laptop
much sit in my bed might be let what's
been going on on the inner webs and so
so if that's what you do let me know if
you do something completely different
I'd love to know but that's it really
I'm sorry that I'm talking so long this
videos going to be kind of like a chatty
one as well
and thank you so much for all the love
and support on my last video I had to be
a little bit real Lib it candid and I
keep saying I kind of like closed up for
a period of time because I got slightly
overwhelmed you but I feel like my
hormones are right now and I'm feeling
like myself so
yeah anyway I'm gonna shut up now and
enjoy the tutorial thanks for watching
guys now at the moment I'm loving all
kinds of luminosity my hands are really
dry real dry what I'm using on my face
is the jaw the light masters Prime art
from Giorgio Armani and this is just a
nice light reflecting and primer and you
can see it's kind of got some a luminous
Ness a luminosity to it before I put my
foundation and stuff on and I feel like
I'm loving foundations with a bit more
of a glow right now because when I was
on holiday I was glowing eyes that glow
glow so I've got new brushes and which
were sent to me from AM B rose which is
actually a brush line created by another
youtuber coach Chanel they're amazing
and soft and there's nothing like having
new and fresh brushes to use so I'm
going to go ahead and just drop my
foundation on and I'm finding that I'm
liking a warmer color right now and this
brush is super soft and amazing it's
giving me all kinds of airbrushed effect
loving this so as I was saying I really
haven't been loving the like kind of
weight loss and what weight gain and
water attention that you get and I'm
just being really honest with it you
know seeing yourself change so much it
can be a little bit distressing but in
the same breath obviously you know why
it's happening and it kind of balances
everything out but it's still something
that I'm adapting to but not long to go
I put a little bit more around my chin
area because the chin area is my darker
area and we are halfway through the
first month of the new year how are you
guys doing have you broken any
resolutions yet is it going as you fall
have you had any you know pitfalls
happen yet I know what it's like not
everything's perfect but we'll get there
there's nothing like using fresh brushes
you know you've been using old brushes
for a while so for my concealer I'm
going to stick with the double ware
which is from Estee Lauder and I was
using the LA girl like in my most recent
looks but I'm finding it just
who dragging and like quite draggy and a
little bit ashy so I'm going to just let
that one sit for the moment and I'm just
going to go ahead and apply it under my
eyes and this was definitely my
concealer of the year probably might be
this the same for this year but I am
looking at just trying to switch out my
makeup a little bit more so if you've
got any recommendations please let me
know I honestly don't really like
highlighting this area of my face that
much I feel like it doesn't actually
suit me it's funny there are so many
like trends like beauty trends that are
you know really popular and stuff online
and then when you do them you're like
you know what this doesn't actually look
good on me I feel like I've got quite a
broad forehead I have a short forehead
but it's broad I don't need to broaden
it by adding more attention to it in my
opinion I'm just going to let that sit
and I'm gonna go ahead and do my brows
this is the double brow brush from Estee
Lauder and I'm going to use the
anastasia dipbrow pomade in dark brown
and i'm going to be honest I don't think
this pomade is all that I actually think
that the Mac one is my site and I know
that's literally sacrilege to say
because obviously it's you know the best
product and everybody loves it I think
it's a bit gray for my skin and I think
I need something warm art however the
the eyebrow gel is really really good
I'm going to go in with my mini beauty
blender this is called the mini booty
blend I'm waiting for sure
I'm just going to tap in my concealer
around my eye and everything okay I had
to get something I've got the Loreal
infallible fixing mist and that's just
going to dampen it but also it helps the
makeup to last as well and I was going
to use this at the very end
lovely jubbly now when it comes to my
brows obviously putting concealer on
them is amazing but I'm kind of not
feeling that overly highlighted look so
I usually would use my foundation color
as well as combining it with a concealer
as well just so it's not so bright you
know and I've been loving all these
videos about like you know the trends to
leave behind in 2015 lots of people have
been putting them out and there's some I
totally agree with and someone that I
really like that but definitely the over
highlighted halo brow is a one to go and
actually what I should have done for us
is put my brow gel on so this is the
brow gel in expresso which it just warms
up a little bit and you're not thinking
about bleaching my brows like going a
light brown on the brows I saw it
recently from a makeup artist and I was
like that looks so nice even on some of
my skintone and it wasn't like bleach
like blonde but it was like more of a
softer Brown then a harsh black and I
think it looks really really nice I
think that's what I'm den genuinely
going to do I just need a pro to like
help me do it and it sounds like my
husband has come bearing gifts is that
across and I smell
now this one's looking all kinds of thin
at the end so I'm gonna just fill that
out when it comes to the baking or just
powdering I'm still using the BEM I'd
powders I do find that they asked in a
little heavy and I'm combining banana
and topaz together to get my perfect
color personally I don't like the over
overly overly baked look that makes any
sense while that sets I'm just going to
go ahead and do my eyes I'm using the
Urban Decay eyeshadow primer says
anti-aging Lee I didn't know that but it
can have a cross on please mmm I
literally love questions mm-hmm I always
say I hate when people hum when they eat
like it's not even a joke so for my eyes
I'm using the Kat Von D shade and light
palette I saw Jaclyn hills and favorites
and this was if one of them are spilling
all kinds of special because I was like
this is my favorites and last year I
basically use this for most every look
and this is literally been my most
favorite look because it is just a
gorgeous cool warm and neutrals palette
it's got everything you need in it I'm
going to go ahead and just tap that I'm
going to tap that on my brow on my brow
on my eyelid hello and this kind of just
lightens up my eyelids cuz I've got
really dark eyelids
basically I'm gonna go ahead and use
this color here and I just use that in
my kind of bridgie area I don't know if
you can see but it's kind of like a warm
purple it just warms everything up and
then the brown that is there and I love
when I can just do a whole look with one
palette I'm just going to use that here
to could just cut my crease lightly that
is just crumbs everywhere
I'm just every moment I'm just stopping
and just eating loving it and it does a
pallet I say that everyone needs to have
it's basically the max eyeshadow 15 and
15 colors palette in the warm neutrals I
can do an look every single day with
just this palette and I'm gonna go ahead
and just add some gold and stuff into my
tear duct areas because it's a really
matte look I like to just you know I
don't look a bit of twinkle in my eye
or I should just dust this off the job
let's get rid of all the baking because
I'm feeling very well very well bait
okay so I'm going to go ahead and just I
go for these three kind of Goldy colors
I just tap between them and I just add
gold into my tear duct and I just like
the way it just gives me a little bit
more brightness when I'm wearing a matte
look I'm going to go ahead with a black
eyeliner this is a black eyeliner from
the body shop and I usually close my
eyes I'm trying not to do that because
when I close my eyes it kind of goes
down there but if I can try and keep my
eyes open it's not so bad by luck a
crazy one more I'm doing it so don't
laugh at me oopsie and then and go to
liquid line at the top what am I going
to liquid line and wet the top of my
eyelid aha I'm going to use the Rimmel
scandalous eye this is a really good
liquid liner it gives me a nice dark
defined line I always struggle with
getting my eyeliner matching hopefully
they kind of are look alright
I'm going to go ahead and use the
wonderful mascara as well from Rimmel
then I'm going to put my false rice
lashes on the difference that lashes
make to like a look is ridiculous and
I'm not going to lie I'm definitely a
full time lash girl and that's why I
love having the false lash extension but
my novel aw I've got a discount code I
believe in the description bar below so
check it out and the ones that I'm
wearing what are these called cannot
remember for the life of me these have
become my new favorite ones as well but
I will link the details as well oh yeah
Michael's literally the provider of food
loving it
and literally I shouldn't show off but
I'm literally the most spoiled girl ever
my husband knows that the way to my
heart is from my belly
I don't do gifts but I do do food lashes
are on why haven't done is one to
contour and a little bit of highlight
you know you guys know I love to contour
with foundation and I just basically use
a foundation that is darker than my skin
tone and I do it around my nose and
slightly around my cheeks I don't do too
heavy a contour just to narrow my bridge
and then I do a line there just to give
me a little bit of a button nose a tip
but blending is essential and it's so
funny lo something people have been
commenting
in on like this my face looking
different and stuff and obviously I
think it looks a bit different but maybe
you guys are noticing it more but I am
you know contouring a little bit and
I've got a new camera I've got these
sony a5100 havein asking me about what i
use for like my Instagram photos which
everybody uses I'll link it in the
description bar below but I do find that
it changes the shape of my face no word
of a lie
it definitely makes my face look
different to the iPhone camera and
initially I didn't like what it was
doing but I've kind of warmed to it and
I might show you I've been loving the
NARS Stephen Klein this is a
highlighting contour kit it's called
vengeful the glow on this is ridiculous
so I put a tip a bit on the tip of my
nose and down my bridge and then just to
this part of my cheek now you can
sometimes over glow and I said that /
glow can look kind of greasy but do you
know what I'm sound kissed right now so
I'm just going to enjoy it I just need
to blend my nose contour a little bit
more looking a little harsh now my lips
I feel stole the show on my snapchat
when I showed what I was wearing my lips
people were like loving it it's this
color from la splash called untamed and
I bought it when I was in New York I
haven't seen it here or anything and
it's kind of like a matte Brown and it
dries just really matte and really nice
and then I've been combining that with
stingray from colour-pop cosmetics which
is the collaboration with it's my
ray-ray and I've been combining the two
now this product it was about 14 dollars
so I don't know I think that's kind of
kind of cheap but kind of not cheap but
it smells funny and it dries your lips
out but it looks amazing so you kind of
got to balance it up I'm not even gonna
lie it kind of make sure it looks kind
of crusty
so I'm wish to rise beforehand and then
afterwards I just make sure I get it all
off but I have to be really careful with
application and the other thing I've
been doing is I'm just careful the way I
shape my lips because I've got very much
lips that look just like they're just
there there
Ginger's there was I want to try and
create more of a shape to it like more
of a Cupid's bow
now I'm not someone who clearly needs to
overdraw my lips if anything they kind
of need to be under drawn because
they're quite big but I let this dry a
little bit because the color changes
completely when it's dry and I'm going
to add a stingray into the middle I'm
going to highlight just a little bit
above my Cupid's bow as well so that is
what it looks like dried it's kind of
like a movi Brown
I feel so sophisticated like this I'm
going to go ahead and add sting right in
the middle and that's what the lips look
like when it's done so I kind of have to
blend them together to really make it
work but I feel like I usually have to
wear two tones to make my lips look good
because they don't have much shape to
them but when I wear the two-tone it
kind of makes them look a little bit
more shapely and pretty but that is my
current favorite go-to look and I just
been loving it that's it really if you'd
like to see more of like a current
favorite face kind of thing regularly
then let me know in the comments if
there's anything else you want to see
let me know I'll be willing to share
with y'all and that's basically it
i'ma catch em later and thank you for
