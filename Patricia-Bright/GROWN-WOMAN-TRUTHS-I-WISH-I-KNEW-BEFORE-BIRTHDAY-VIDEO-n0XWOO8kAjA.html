wanted to do a video sharing some of the
things that I've learned now that I'm a
little bit older and wiser and some of
you guys might not know February is my
birthday month and I have a big
milestone birthday I had a huge epic
Casino Royale being party it was
dramatic it was extra
over-the-top but I'll let you know what
I don't get to do this regularly and I
filmed a birthday video I'm going to
share in this video but I thought it'd
be nice for me to come before I share
that and kind of do some learnings now
that I'm a big grown woman because at
this point in time if I haven't learned
anything in my life then you know it
would be a huge pity but I definitely
feel like I had and the whole point in
me doing youtube videos is to share that
with you guys and so that's what I'm
going to do before you get to see the
epic you know costing are way out there
and party and all that kind of good
stuff so yeah let's get into this so the
number one thing that I have known
either an order is that life is about
love and I know that sounds really corny
and cringy but it really is if you are
able to give of yourself to other people
be in a romantic relationship in
friendship in good deeds in selfless
acts honestly these are the things that
are generally going to make cheese truly
happy not going to life I love me a
material thing I love me a shoes a
handbag and I shadow a designer I love
it it's nice but it does not bring
long-term happiness so for me if it was
all about making sure that I interact
with my friends my family and also a
meet and connect with new people because
it's the most amazing thing that gives
you true and ultimate joy someone is
always going to have something negative
to say so let them it's not your
business to worry about what other
people think about you yawn yawn yawn it
doesn't wasn't about you you need to be
bothered about you because there's a lot
of energy
wasted if you're one of those lucky
girls to avoid skinny yes the body isn't
gonna sit right forever you know if you
don't use it you're gonna lose it like
things are not as tight and as plus as
they used to be and so exercise is
actually necessary sometimes it might
appear that people had it all laid out
for them or that they're lucky or that
there's an excuse but the reality is
that there are years of grind and focus
and dedication and that is actually what
makes people successful don't hate the
player hate the game I know this is
another cliche but it is not to be
afraid of failure and I definitely say
fail far you've got to be confident
enough to try something and not be
embarrassed you think doesn't work if I
gather what we drop it and move all the
way along a lot of people never start
anything because they're like you know
what it's not going to work what people
going to think but all of that do what
you need to do and if it doesn't work
move on it's definitely easier to be
yourself then trying to be somebody else
at some point in time you have to be
other shaming you and embracing all the
things that you have about yourself that
making yourself and I know it's this
about older people they really don't
care and they do themselves so that when
you're younger you either try to
minimize yourself or you try to be extra
or you do a bit of both to kind of
please people but actually the best way
to be long term happy is just to do what
makes you happy and do yourself you
might never feel like you've maybe I
realized that life isn't about reaching
a point but it's actually about the
process and the journey and for me my
point is just keep moving up and up and
up and up and up and so what I have
learned to do is kind of just realize
that your ever process of whatever I'm
working towards I've got to ensure that
I'm learning growing sharing and
enjoying that process I've learnt that
hope and faith in Jesus Christ for me is
an absolute essential to true happiness
and sharing that with people it's
something that I want to make a priority
for myself even though I'm older I feel
exactly the same but with just a little
bit more sense you have to spend money
to make money
another thing I've realized is that you
might not fit in anywhere and I think
this has been one of the things that I
feel I've ever always struggled with
never quite fitting in to any kind of
group kind of thing like where do where
do you place me where do I place myself
and it doesn't matter I don't need to be
placed anywhere I'm here I am where I am
and I will create my own hole to fit my
square peg into yes all right so those
are some of the quick things that I have
learned now that I'm a little bit older
and wiser for those of you who know
about what age you are I would love to
know what the key things that you have
learned in your life over the last few
years please leave a comment because
people absolutely love them and I read
them because I know I've definitely
missed out some on some but this is
what's in my head right now in the
meantime this is my epic epic video and
I think I think because it was so much
fun for me
this is a bit indulgence but I still
thought it'd be nice and you guys to see
it it was filmed by Jessie's amazing our
linking down below
I had my cake done but a great couple
they have an amazing cake business I'll
link them down below and my table was
just stunning all my confectionery alter

you enjoy and I'll see you later

moving out and winning</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
