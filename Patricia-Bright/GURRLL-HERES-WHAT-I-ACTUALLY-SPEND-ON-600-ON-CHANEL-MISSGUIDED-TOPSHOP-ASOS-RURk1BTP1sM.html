okay like a cardboard DHL box hello
beautiful people welcome to my channel I
hope you are doing well today darlings I
am coming to you with the ice but it's
not really a nice manner is the goodies
that I have spent on myself that I
genuinely like them really excited about
that I want you guys to see and know is
really really good and of course I do my
series where I'm actually reviewing
websites but you know I like this stuff
there that I don't really like I'm like
what is this I go in certain websites
that aren't really my style but for you
guys I will check it out I'll review it
and give you my honest unbiased opinion
about it so you can buy in purchase in
peace if you want to come to your
golfers I would tell you the truth
however today I wanted to do the goodies
that man honestly for me they are so
amazing I love the way they look on
they're great they're forms on my
favorite website and just to show you
what I've actually been spending my coin
in this season so if you're not already
subscribed to subscribe turn on the
notifications follow me on my social and
all that good stuff but yeah let's just
get into this video okay guys so this is
like my first favorite piece this is for
my misguided love it I've been wearing
it all the time like this is my new
favorite dress
I love the splits and like just I don't
know the way it's got stripes on it and
I loved it so much but I also bought the
grey it's like a bodycon dress like this
and terminus I have to wear it when I
haven't had any lunch and hole eyes but
I think it looks fantastic on it's super
flattering this is this bodycon dress on
it's kind of cute you can see you know
the little bit of very fat going on but
I am sucking in for dear life so if it's
okay but feel like it gives me a little
bit of you know little contour and I
just think it's a really nice dress I
love this color it's like oh is it a
mole or like a musty dusty pink and then
look at the sleeves I love it it's a
little bit cold to wear this right now
but it's just it's really nice I think
it's cute and I would wear this with
trainers or heels as well because I feel
like it's liking that
casual tennis dress which I love this
might not look cute like it looks a bit
a weird kind of dirty sick in color but
it's not it's really nice I prefer to
wear this is something black but it's
this little croc trucker denim jacket
I'm feeling crop jacket I know I know it
doesn't make any logical sense but so
far I just love the way it looks on I
find it really flattering with an
all-black outfit it actually when you
wear cropped jackets like this I feel
like it makes your waist look a little
bit slimmer so this is what this little
number looks like slightly cropped I'm
trying to move away from wearing black
all the time like this was like a really
nice little jacket I'm not gonna lie
your kidneys are probably getting a
little bit cold in this but you know
this is for styling this isn't for
keeping warm and being comfortable this
is just to look cute and I feel like the
only way I can really wear this is a
rockin all-black outfit but again that's
cute little trucker jacket love it so I
know I just said I'm gonna be wearing
this back but I did pick up this black
little jacket with these tassels and
everything so I am going to Coachella
you got is going to Coachella and I'm
actually gonna be going to LA for like 3
or 4 weeks so I want to go to a jacket
that I could just pass it around and
look fantastic in and I feel like this
is like the perfect jacket is so cute
and it's got that kind of you know
cowboy s vibe going on you know so you
know I want to be a cowboy in back ok
guys so here's my little festival fringe
jacket number swear down I've never had
a fringe jacket before I think I can
honestly say that and I've always wanted
one by voice shied away and I just
thought this one was cute especially as
I like to spread my wings but you just
see me coming I think it's a really nice
jacket
well I everyone is a fringe jacket in
their life like if you don't have one
get a frigid jacket people get a friend
jacket just sit just so you can do this
so when I buy for myself I actually
don't buy too much I only buy stuff that
I love love love so that is all I have
for misguided so three four pieces and
she's not that crazy when it comes to
shopping for myself when I'm reviewing
stuff however you know we we go out so
next up I went to Topshop and I feel
like I haven't really said this right I
feel like Topshop is actually one of my
favorite stores still there's still some
pieces that I do like in there and I
always feel quite confident about the
quality so I bought a few pieces in
there also if you guys want to see you
like a proper I spent err on Topshop let
me know cuz I'll be able to sit through
buying some goodies and share my opinion
you know Patricia you might need to just
take a step back because this is another
cropped jacket but it's a cropped denim
jacket and it's got this like floral and
bleach wash into it how adorable is this
how adorable I'm not gonna lie I love
cropped denim jackets it's a disease
we're gonna stop right now we're
actually gonna start but this is the
last one
how about is this okay guys so this is
the Topshop denim jacket nice and thick
nice and not warm but let me not lie
it's not warm but it's cute it's really
nice to lay on top of an outfit and the
fit is like the perfect perfect fit like
the drop sleeves I love the floral kind
of pattern on it as well this is just
it's just it's just cute sorry
the thing is I hate to come across as
like I'm feeling myself but you know
when you're feeling yourself you gotta
say this is my kind of jacket really
nice and long sleeves as well you just
 over on this is why I love Topshop
guys is this cute always it's not you I
don't think it I like it
so I've also got this orange jumper this
looks very grandma right now but on it's
gorgeous
it's not grandma it's not it's really
nice and like I said alright my new
thing is color rich in color rich in
life my new thing is color so is this
top not one of my at all love it just
feel like detail key the color is right
on my street and it's really really
comfortable I know I love me a sweater I
love me a bright colored sweater - OMG
or little squaw or something this right
here is just just just the nice little
jungle like I like casual stuff like
this as well it's like a cute little
dress but this wasn't that kind of all
this was just some spring basics that I
really wanted to have and this is just
one of the kind of things I would always
wear just everyday nice and oh nice and
orange
I don't interview and it to be nice an
orange bra it's bright it's fun it's
easy to wear guys I mean I'm really
upset because I wish I had much that was
like this but it says darling darling
then you beat me to it Topshop this is
buff how cute is this
yes darlings darlings this is so mean
just because of the statement and also I
love zipper tops like this and actually
all of my zip up kind of and they could
track tops they're all from Topshop I
have three different track tops from
Topshop so this is lovely
this is like the trial and elements so
important I feel at least look cute but
it looks boxy a F or me no in this
videos not all of the stuff right I did
love this I really picked this up and I
really love it but I look really boxy in
it I don't like it sorry on retrying you
on I look boxy as heck and like a
cardboard DHL box no look I would have
to do a lot of like you know angles for
this to look cool but if you're not
standing like this unflattering oh yeah
sometimes I get really annoyed at myself
like always by block color I don't know
why I don't like flower and pattern too
too much it always is a bit overbearing
however I picked up some stripes and
what I like about this is that it's low
but not too low it's kind of insane
arrests top I love the contrasting
sleeves how they're a different strike
pattern it's cute it's not too crop that
kind of crop I can wear this with like
lower jeans
why is everything crop people why this
is I have to go to the gym you know this
is what I have to be careful of my eatin
because everything is crop and I look
and pi if I'm wearing them you know I'm
gonna be the person who wears the the
crop with my belly hanging all the way
out can we make that a trend I think
that if bellies out was a trend and big
bellies are popular I'll be the hottest
girl ever you know how many of us would
be the hottest girls if like people was
a trend but she you know what's crazy
that could happen
there was a time where big buns were
gross right people didn't like them well
you know Africans always like big
problems but there's a peak time where
people didn't like big bumps not big
bumps yes everyone wants a big bump what
happens when everyone wants a big baby
whoa no one a big Whitney I'm done
I am down look let's cut paying for it
big Vinny truck okay so here is this top
hit with the strikes and the slight crop
if I was to wear be wearing trousers it
would probably have a little bit of a
gap but not major one and I usually wear
high-waisted jeans anyway but how cute
is this I feel like a little sailor's
wife as you can see like I don't my
low-cut tops or anything but I said when
I want my V and my like low-cut it
doesn't have to be all the way up my
areolar let let's let me assess this so
if you like touch what really does have
the kind of neck right really really
down but I love love love love the to
waist strikes about this this is very
spring/summer no all I now need is my
own yacht
or you know someone to drag the yacht
for me that's what I need in Santorini
your life this is how this stock makes
you feel okay this I'm so excited about
I don't even know where I'm going I
haven't got any koala days books but
this is this gorgeous and bright yellow
swimsuit from Topshop it's the most
gorgeous shape you know not too much
fans but just a little bit cuz it's
slightly higher raised it's gonna fit
perfectly
honestly I love a bright yellow swim to
this makes me want to book holiday Jim
if I buy some shooting you like 90 the
holiday just to wear this one suit this
is that swimsuit and it's actually quite
thick in material it's gonna like hold
you in and that's why I really liked
about it
and the fact that it was just this
really nice color and it's just really
nice look at that bad boy
okay guys so here is this yellow Topshop
swimsuit
I always feel a bit weird coming here in
swimwear but you know we do it for you
guys
this is such a nice women costume I
can't like low back quite open up the
side but it doesn't bother me I love the
fit of this it's high but not too high
and I don't know it's just really
flattering I feel like it's really
flattering I don't have the sock in load
as I wear it I feel like for those of
you who like to cover up a little bit
more in the saloon Department this is a
great option for me someday let's have
it all now but some days I might know I
just want to throw in a swimsuit that I
feel really comfortable in and just look
at the back of that that's so so nice
okay and this is also another swimsuit
that I picked up I've got a thing for
like blinds right about now or I don't
know what they call this like it's not
many stripes but like ruching we're just
gonna call it ruching I've got a thing
for it this room suits really nice I
love the fact that it's flat across the
top and I know it says from a costume
but I would wear this as a top as well
Topshop you did me well okay so I also
hear a Czar's a favorite of mine I
bought a few pieces from Azoff of number
one I bought a blazer another blazer but
this is a chest blazer this is actually
from mango this blazer so exhaust of
ously sells mango and other places and
this blazer was right up my street I've
been seeing as fair few girls wearing
like check blazer there's like you know
what this is really a look because I can
be bougie but I can also be stop all in
the same day like just by unbuttoning a
few of the holes here is this like
blazer jacket tea dressing I'm just
gonna call it long blazer I really like
this I love the color of it I feel like
I can wear like a mini dress underneath
it I can wear something like shorts and
this kind of thing underneath it but at
the same breath kind of you know still
look kind of cool the only thing I'm
wishing is that it had a bell like it
doesn't have a bell but it'll be nice
and then I'm festival ready so I also
picked up this dress from Azoff but it's
actually a boohoo dress and it's very
like you know I don't know it's a hippie
s festival s it's a long dress with this
floral detail I know it's slightly
Little House on the Prairie sliding or
it seems to be a thing that I always
talk about but I thought this was just
so so so nice and I feel like I can at
least all this to look really nice and I
feel like spring summer comes if I'm
gonna be in the desert or whatever you
know I want something that looks you
know very hard like floating cool love
this
okay so here's money or Little House on
the Prairie dress oh it's cute right it
is cute we've got a little bit of
cleavage on show but it isn't bad or
anything it isn't too wide
and I I've got this because I wanted to
have a little you know moment in the
desert and I feel like this dress is
gonna give me that moment in it dresser
desert while I'm being you know a hippie
fairy at Coachella thought dizzy what
I'm being a hippie family at Coachella
it's nice like that again I wouldn't be
wearing this here but I would wear on
holiday I would run holiday I would wear
to a festival I feel like I should be
just singing with daisies in my hair
darlings I quite like it it's not my
normal normal style but it is my kind of
holiday style so I like this I think
it's pretty so this is super cute it's
the super simple slightly cropped
t-shirt with the female symbol right in
the middle and it was just nice I love a
little t-shirt that says something
without saying too much and this was
just super cute kind of cropped but
loose like not doing the most crop I
think this is really nice it's just a
casual t-shirt spring/summer love it I
haven't got so many t-shirts in my
wardrobe and I feel like you can always
add a few more so this is this t-shirt I
know it looks really simple but it's so
cute it's so cute it's slightly cropped
but it's got that wide crop this wine
cup is my favorite kind of crop because
from the side it gives you way more
vol it's really good for lunch frames
but it also makes your waist look
smaller which is what this is my favor
cut of a t-shirt or a crop top look at
that it's so nice but this is right up
my street even with these shorts this is
like the perfect look they look really
really good together and such and such a
fan I'm a fan
finally from Azoff I picked up some
trainers they're actually plimsolls I
didn't know these were plimsoll if I've
been completely a hundred percent on
most of you I thought they were trainer
I don't know let me put them on and
decide if I like them here's me trying
on the a D - clip soles I don't like
them very much because actually I
already have vans and these are giving
me van Phibes already so I don't really
need them they're not an essential for
me so they're gonna go back to the shop
as well it's an either you love or you
hate but don't be a hater okay I kind of
stopped showing my design their
collection some of the designers stuff
that by I'm not I'm acting like I
brought a lot I don't and so I've been
wanting to try some of the like the
trainers that are really chunky but
whenever I'm gone I went to go try the
Balenciaga at Alexander McQueen's but
they just make my foot look like a house
- not my house is a condo on my ankle an
actual condo this so big and I you know
cried with a like I would have be cool I
want to wear the chunky trainers and
these are achieved from the newest
season from Chanel and I was like wow
these are actually really nice and I
could wear them tried them on I was sold
I was sort of like yeah these are
beautiful and they're really really
comfortable as well and some people like
this is an ugly trade but there's just a
big CC on it no no don't be a hater you
didn't pay for them okay actually allows
your opinion whatever but I just really
like the style of these trainers that
the chunky trainers that don't look
cray-cray on me and I love you now I
can't lie I've got you know two
our pieces but you know they're what
worth it and valuable to me and this is
just a stunning shoe okay so these are
the there are trainers on I mean I
know some people gonna look like them
but for me when it comes to the chunky
trainer trend these are the best I've
found that suit me and look absolutely
amazing I really like them on I really
love the colorway because they're white
but they've got the black on it and the
blue on the inside they are perfect and
I'm a huge huge huge huge fan okay guys
that is it for me that's me showing some
of the stuff I actually like that I
actually want to spend my coin on and I
mean obviously through the high spenders
there's some pieces I'm like though this
comes into my main closet you guys know
about that it might come into my make of
it not all the time but these are some
of the stuff that I bought for myself
this season I'm really really excited
about that I'm gonna be wearing so you
guys should make sure you'll follow me
on my social but yeah guys I think that
is it for me so in the meantime I will
catch you all later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
