video is gonna be a general questions
video so what I'm gonna do is answer all
the questions that you guys have written
quite regularly and then just get
through them so you can find out a bit
more about me if you do have any
additional questions that I haven't
answered leave a comment below and make
sure you read the other comments that
have been left so we don't start
duplication and I don't have to go
through loads and loads and loads of
comments so first question I got Ark so
much about my hair so let me just
address it now the hair you seen up the
same hair okay I've had this hair for
about the past
nine weeks the same have not changed it
I might you know take it out put it back
in to get out put back in change to the
part the direction or anything like that
but it's really just the same way and
this is now my hair for life because it
blends so well with my real hair and
it's called its remy hair
it's mangonia remy hair however it's
called a light yaki and i'd get it um
I've had it well it's kind of made to
this texture for me and I kind of tell
him the guy who makes it for me the
degree I want it done by now I get so
much questions about this I decided to
get a lot of this hair so I've got about
10 to 20 packs coming down and if you're
interested in getting the send me a
message and be first come first for
those of you who want to try it out and
just buy it it's really not that what's
not that expensive compared to other
Brazilian hair that's on the market and
stuff like that and I do do my hair
myself so I don't go to a hairdressers
I've done my hair and all I've done here
since I was 13 so it's something that
I'm really really passionate about
really really enjoy doing and we'll see
what happens in the future regarding me
and her so regards to my makeup I get
asked a lot about what lipstick I'm
wearing so I'm either wearing one of two
lipsticks okay
other than today so I'm usually wearing
Lady gaga
viva la Glam lipstick that is what I'm
wearing most of the time and then
a little bit of lip gloss over it is my
staple and also this one I think it's by
Maybelline I can't remember who who
makes this one and it's it's this kind
of color and it's called vintage pink I
really do like this one these you can
see that they're run down and I will
purchase them again if I'm wearing a
nude it's gonna be Mac Jubilee that's
the color I always wear but today I'm
actually wearing papaya punch by sleek
and it's kind of like a matte lipstick
which I really really like get up still
about Maureen Maureen will be coming
into a video at some point in fact I
will probably do a cyst attack everyone
felt like leave a message but we wanna
see Maureen and because she she does
she's not really one of these you to be
glamour people when she's not into it at
all but that and anyone who doesn't know
the Maureen is more and it's my younger
sister who's often behind the camera
even comments you know or not even
comments about making comments at the
back of the video and it's quite funny
when she is around but not a few time to
do videos on what I wear to work but to
be honest I do not dress up for what at
all it is a shame I'm glitchy I'm in
gray with a black suit what I'm not
black see but a black suit jacket with a
skirt there's really nothing fancy and
it's way too early for me to even care
about why I like in the morning and also
I've been asked about workout videos now
to be honest I don't work out if
anything I'm trying to hold on to the
little bit of weight that I do have but
um you know probably the only issues I
do have is I had a bit of a potbelly but
yeah I'm not that fast to be honest so I
doubt I'll be doing one of those I
wouldn't really give advice to people or
things I don't actually do myself I've
also been asked where do I live still
live at home with my parents I'm in
London for those of you who don't know
I've graduated from the University like
a year ago like over a year ago and I'm
working full time in London but still
live at home I'm saving you know Island
by house I'm not going to move out and
start paying rent I think it's a waste
of money
yes that's what I am I think I'm done
really but as I said leave some more of
your questions down below and I'll
definitely start looking at them and
start answering them for you guys and if
you have anything else you want to know
about people so thanks for watching bye
by the way I ended up eating some toasts
through this M film so if it looks like
got crumbs around my mouth it probably
do from talking funny it's probably the
peanut butter I apologize in Thai they
said good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
