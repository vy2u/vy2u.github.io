this is part of my diet coke break
series ever I'm a diet coke and today I
am just gonna get Graham with you all
hello beautiful people welcome to my
channel I hope you are doing well little
bit of a difference that I just wanted
to do again I deal with me a bonus of
you I'm about to go somewhere very nice
this evening and I'm taking some time to
have a full-blown clan like a metallic
inspired glam so I wanted to just you
just do it get ready with me
from start to finish I've just had a
shower I've just moisturized and we're
gonna go through the whole process
probably gonna do voiceover because it
will be a little bit easier but yeah
let's get into it okay so the first step
is all about the hair guys obviously I
have my bright cherry red hair that I
absolutely love but one of my favorite
ways to maintain and make this hairstyle
look extra Graham is by using pin curls
I found that this hair it doesn't hold a
curl as much as I would like it to so I
like to give it a nice little brush out
use a curling wand to create the initial
pearls along with either a blow dryer or
a straightener and I just you know get
my hair nice and flat using the curling
Tong to really get some heat into there
and I'll create a curl and then pin
those bad boys up
so pink curling is quite an old-school
method which I used to use back in the
day to really kind of hold my calls or
even create codes before I had a
straightener but you know I kind of
forgot about it until I went to the
hairdresser's who actually did this on
me the last time and I love the way it
look I let these sit and the magic
happens once it cause the curl should be
popping but while I'm doing that I'm
going to do my face time for a beat so a
little story this is my makeup bag full
of life like I literally have that with
me all the time and it's got all my
favorites in particularly my brow
products my face products anything that
I need to create the perfect look for a
regular basis I've also decided to put a
bit of powder on my face beforehand
because I need my makeup to last all day
and I find that is the best way to
really have long-lasting makeup and then
I go ahead and finish off my brows I
feel like you guys do know the drill
when it comes to my you know normal glam
makeup routine I'm going in with my
favorite concealer just to brighten up
underneath my eyes on the bridge of my
nose and on my forehead and of course
blending is always essential to really
make sure everything settles in nicely I
might go ahead and apply it my contour
stick because I want to have some
definition and look nice and snatched
Burgundy's and red seem to be my current
favorite colors so I'm go ahead and
applying that in to my eyes but I'm
gonna add a little bit of just and I did
cry mob because I wanted to do a kind of
cut crease you guys know I am NOT a
makeup throat listen let's not pretend
like I am I just enjoy putting it on so
I wanted to do something that was a
little bit creative and I went for a cut
crease but priming my eyelids burst is
essential before going in with a lid
color I also decided to take that out a
little bit and almost create a little
bit of
wing along with some shading and then I
went in with something quite fancy using
my fingers I priced a metallic a kind of
Goldy silver on my lid and then I just
tried to keep blending everything out
and to be honest this is the first time
I've ever done a like a cut crease like
this so just give me five please give me
a high five for that and then I'm
applying some powder just to set under
my eyes and around my face just so I'm
extra matte and for that extra touch of
glam I decided to go in with a Goldy
silver liner to create a really defined
cut crease that had a little bit of
metallic sparkle to it
and obviously mascara and lashes that is
the way to tie everything all in I think
with a very light lid like this I
definitely need to go in with lashes and
everything to make you guys see and of
course the highlighter has to pop and
I've gone in with a highlighter that I
really think just brings the whole look
together for my lips lining just with a
nice regular brown and then going on
with almost like this kind of gray Brown
just like that like had a lot of color
and drama going on I wanted to keep my
lips really muted but glam at the same
time okay that is the beet done and I'm
feeling myself and now the curls have
cooled and it's time to take them down
and it's so funny how Pinker is kind of
look you're like oh what's my hair gonna
look like but you just kind of have to
be patient and what you'll see is like
curls they're just really really stay in
place they look really really tight but
the whole power and glam happens when
you pull them out and you give them that
brush down so they're those curls are
big and bouncy they can look a little
bit too kindly so the whole point is to
really brush those out really elongate
and stretch them out and honestly when I
do this these cars last for so long
often I do find my curls drop but I love
the fact that you know when I do this
hairstyle they really do last clearly I
am feeling myself so we've got to finish
it off with the look honey's metallic
glam silver I am here for it's party
season and I feel like this dress really
does genuinely embody that perfectly
yeah guys that is it I am glam and I
hope that gave you a little bit of
inspiration in the meantime make sure

inspired video as well so guys thanks
