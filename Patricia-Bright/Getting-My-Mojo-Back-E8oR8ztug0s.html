weeks ago on my all my past few videos I
said I was going to address the topic of
getting your mojo back but this has
actually inspired me to kind of do more
than just an ad-hoc video him there I
plan on having like a video like this
maybe once a week or once every two
weeks depending on what works for you
guys and I did the girl problem series
but I really felt like I wanted to do
more than just goal problems and just
address life problems that anyone can be
affected by young old or whatever
because there's one thing I like doing
it's one talking I absolutely love
talking to I give myself a headache but
I also like sharing and using my words
in a positive way that can make a
difference in people's lives per inch
whether to razor my middle names
actually Theresa by the way so in the
nose anyway so I thought I would start
at maybe series I'm thinking of calling
it guide to life but if you think
there's anything better than leave a
comment below maybe a title of the
series of how I should do them and I'm
thinking of doing one video once a week
maybe every other week or something like
that so again write that in the comments
below and I'm gonna be addressing your
topics like your issues that you have
and I've had some emails of late well I
always get emails and I was like let me
just really address these because I get
quite a few of the same one so dealing
with a broken heart and bringing a guy
home how would you do that and
confidence is a massive one I get so I'm
going to address these topics but if you
have any topics you want me to answer or
discuss then literally and follow me on
Facebook and Twitter
and is it hashtag yet no acne patio
loves you and then hashtag and g TL so
guide to life and then with your
question on your query but if you don't
want to make it public then just do it
on facebook as well so let's get to the
topic of losing your mojo and i think
some of you might ask
is a mojo well I see is kind of that
spark that unique thing about you that
gives you joy peace confidence it's just
that that groove you know that groove is
your mojo and I definitely felt like I
had lost my mojo for a period of time
but I've kind of been getting it back
and I'm gonna tell you how I do that
there are too many ways I think that you
lose your mojo one of them is by words
and I know people don't you know
everything that sways but words the
things that people say about you the
things that you say about yourself the
things that you are now to come in to
your being can impact you and I always
believe the term life and death is in
the power of the tongue so to speak life
and then after that is situations so it
could be your job situation it could be
your home situation it could be the fact
that you're in a negative environment
and you don't realize that that's kind
of putting kind of clouds all over you
and is actually impacting your mojo for
me my mojo was that I used to be someone
who no matter the situation I was fairly
positive that things would always turn
out good and I thought while I was
almost adamant like delusionally adamant
that all things will work out for my
good so yeah even if you know I lost my
legs I would believe that my legs would
be growing back in a year or two but
then I started to kind of quite doubt
alot doubt myself a lot doubt um what
good I could receive and just you know I
allowed my situations to get over me and
get quite negative and it kind of made
me much like maybe you feel quite down
and stuff I'm sure many of you have been
there where you're quite outgoing
confident people and then for that you
kind of retreat and you don't know why
you've retreated or you used to be quite
sure of yourself and then all of a
sudden you're not very sure of yourself
anymore
and that is really not a good place to
be getting it back I think the most
important thing is to know who you are
and a lot of people don't actually know
who they are in terms of you don't know
your value and they don't know your
importance and some people define their
importance but is by who loves them
who's their friend who talks to them how
popular they
how many followers that they have on
Facebook or Twitter or whatever and this
is how they define how important they
are and I actually love to say that
you're me existence you're may being put
together means that you're so valuable
the fact that you are able to live to
breathe the work that it takes
yourselves to get together is literally
a miracle so your life means that you
are valuable and if you have nobody you
have life and breath in your bones and
lungs and that means you are valuable
you're valuable today and you're
valuable for the future and it's really
important to walk in that confidence of
your value and not define your value by
I don't have many friends I have any
followers not very popular not very
successful that doesn't defined
somebody's value your existence defines
value and once you get that into your
head and are able to say that while I'm
alive and I exist and I've been created
and you're valuable once you embrace
that it kind of fills you with the
confidence of your life and despite what
is going on so secondly is now to work
on the words okay so I always believe in
speaking to yourself you might seem
crazy but you if nobody's going to tell
you anything you need to tell yourself
okay so if it's a case of what I'm
beautiful I'm wonderful I was smart and
courageous relay all the things that you
are back to yourself because as he
speaker upon yourself it's all right
charge does but not I'm truly meanness
as you speak things good things to
yourself it starts to push the negative
things away and it always triggers
something in your mind where you
remember your worth you remember your
value and you get excited and that kind
of lifts you up brings your mojo back
and I would say to myself you know
Patricia you know things work together
well for you you know that this listen
this has happened but
you've come out and this and this and
this way Patricia and I'm like oh yeah
oh yeah and then that slowly builds me
back up into remembering my value and my
wife also when there are people around
you for negative or people who are
around you who say things about you to
you whatever and as they speak it as
they speak it these things can kind of
it's almost like a little
it's like stamping on you it's like
pushing you down now when words that are
said to you are negative I like that no
I'll be like I repeat that you cannot
tell me nothing right and you've got to
learn to do that you have to get
yourself out of the situation where
people might say bad things to you or
say bad things about you you don't take
those on board you don't accept them as
they come in you reject them well I'm
sorry I don't accept that simple as that
and that will help you build your
confidence and you will be able to stand
firm in who you are as a person so I am
that whole section is proclaiming the
truth of who you are so the next thing
is to work out the situations and they
send negative situations environments
these are the things that can trigger
you losing your mojo and actually it's a
very slow process and you might not
realize slowly but surely you're in the
same situation you get more and more
down there this could be at work this
could be at home you just realize slowly
but surely is kind of eating you it's
eating your personality is eating who
you are you need to identify that and
you need to either work how to change
that environment or how to get that
environment if it could be as simple as
rearranging your room and getting some
flowers in and some candles it could be
as simple as that it could be a place
where you actually have to get up and
leave your job and do what you want to
do to get your mojo back or you might
have the new home if it's not a
conducive environment for you to be in
but you've got to identify that that
situation could be triggering you losing
your mojo and then once you
identify that choose to change it make
an active decision to change it or
choose to get out of it so the final
thing I think there is to remember is
that this is just a part of life
losing your mojo and getting it back can
happen all the time anything can trigger
you kind of being down about yourself so
finally you've got to remember that this
is an ongoing process and that it's not
just one BAM do these two things or
three things and you're very you're
wonderfully confident and you've got all
your mojo back but it's an ongoing
process and it's a part of life and then
many times when you're down there's
gonna be times where you lose yourself
but what you need to do is ensure that
those times don't last for too long that
you lose yourself for far too long and
you can't come back so remember these
things so remember to speak to yourself
I know you might look crazy walking down
the street but at least you've got your
mojo so guys I hoped you enjoyed that
video and it gave you some ideas and how
to get your mojo back any other topic
