another girl problem and it's not gonna
be a beauty one but it's gonna be on the
topic of money money money and this
isn't just a girl program I think this
isn't everybody problem but I think that
this is something that you know we
should address as women as girls to
really get our game up and we like
pretty things we like designer clothes
we like good food like makeup and all
this cost money and I get our skin asked
a lot about you know how do I manage my
money what do I do with it how do I make
it how do I keep it and I feel like I'm
in a position to really talk about this
subject because I find it it's really
important subject to me and I've been
blessed enough to be able to buy a home
alongside my husband with a house in
London and a house in London is not
cheap but I really feel that it's
possible for everybody and I decided
that I must talk about the principles of
money and really just kind of managing
it well and preparing for the future
anyway so let's just you know start a
little blurb so let's find the problem I
find that there are people who they get
money in but literally it's out of their
hands like sad it just like where's the
money man and know what my money's gone
but they get it in and it's just gone
and then you've got people who just
never get enough money and they just
can't seem to ever make the ends meet
and when they're dealing with it the
first things first is just address your
intentions now I always have a bigger
plan like when I get money money is not
just about all that means I can buy a
new shoe or I can buy a new badly what
is my bigger plan if I talk about my
bigger plan my bigger plan is to own
property
my bigger plan is to be able to put my
kids in a good school my bigger plan is
to be able to give to people who don't
necessarily have as much as they would
like my bigger plan is also from a
Christian perspective to give back into
the kingdom and ensure that I can help
the kingdom grow that is for me
personally
and where I have that vision and that
thought of money I have I do not take my
money lightly I don't think it's a case
of oh I've got money spend it on myself
and um just you know waste money because
when you have that bigger plan and that
bigger focus of your finances you are
going to be a lot more respectful the
money that you receive and a lot of
people don't have any respect for money
and you know they Kabat spend on beers
and then broke at the end of the month I
know so many people were like that so
develop your bigger picture your bigger
picture could be I want to pay to go to
university for myself without getting
the student loan I want to buy a car and
in the next two years I want to be able
to travel two times a year and whatever
so develop that bigger picture and that
gives you a goal to manage your money my
next piece of advice is to work out
every single source of income if you've
got a job the natural source of income
if you do like an online business that's
your sort of source of income if you've
got your parents that's your source of
income work out what your sources of
income are and actually how can you
increase your sources of income and this
does not matter your age I remember that
I got my first job when I was about you
know 15 16 oh yeah about 15 16 but I
also did this thing I used to give away
better wear catalogs when I was young
and the next-door neighbor used to let
pay loads of us kids but used to get
like 20 pounds 50 pounds to basically
put these catalogues through people's
door knobs doorknobs people's doors so I
was working and I was doing that thing
and I also used to do hair at school and
in every lunch time I'd have a queue of
girls who wanted their hair braided and
I would be charging yet menial or
celebrating people's hair and charging
five pounds every time I did girls hair
and I had like regular customers for two
three years that was the way I had
multiple different sources of income and
I think if you've got a skill if you
bake cakes if you make clothes or
accessories or jewelry you use that and
you maximize that and make it a source
of income as well as a source of fun
my next piece of advice is about bending
beyond your means and credit now I am
somebody who like I haven't I don't like
credit and I don't like expenses I know
that it is really an enemy of progress
which is one my favorite terms and I
know so many people have got themselves
into positions where they just owe so
much money that every time they've got
money it's just disappearing they've got
credit cards they've got bills they've
got loans where you can avoid getting
credit basically live within your means
live below your means not that you live
in poverty but for instance if you have
the choice between the really expensive
watch or the nice watch when it's
cheaper
choose that one in the mean time and
think about your bigger picture so
whenever you feel that you havin to
compromise think about your bigger
picture and that will really really help
don't get into the cycle of credit and
debt all in the name of shoes bag and
clothes no no no so once you have your
sources of income the next thing to do
is to spread it and like I literally
mean physically spread it don't keep it
in one account keep it in different
locations in terms of how you spread it
apart and for me I always feel that it's
really important to separate certain
money not for yourself get into the
habit of either giving to a charity or
giving to a family member or sacrificing
a little bit of what you have without
expecting it back and giving it out also
in terms of shredding on money what you
need to do is have a what I call my
disposable income that's the amount I'm
allowed to spend on clothes and shoes
and random crap every month versus the
stuff that goes towards my deposit for
my poverty the stuff that goes towards
me giving to somebody else my money that
goes towards and all my expenses my
phone bill my internet bill all that
kind of stuff separate that out and then
you'll see what you've got left to work
with for the month when you've got what
you've got left to the work with for the
month you can work out okay each week I
spend 50
pounds each week I spent 10 pounds you
know who knows what you got it depends
next piece of ice is always watch your
money and how you spend some of us we
just get our cards out and we're like oh
dude oh dude put that card in by that by
that we're just spending spending
spending and we don't realize how much
we're actually spending and how our
balance is going low low low that you
really enjoy your overdraft and then
you're all gosh fines here and there
like no no no watch your money online
banking telephone banking check that
account I checked my bank account I
don't check my bank account that much
but do check your bank account regularly
another great thing to do actually is to
take out cash take out certain amount
per week or per month I see this is my
cash back card fling that card away put
that on the side don't use that card
until next month comes or next payment
comes and ensure that that cash amount
that you've got is all you spend don't
spend over there unless you need to my
final piece of advice when it comes to
money is a little bit fluffy but it is
really a principle that I I truly live
by and it's this principle of you know
not to live in fear and that fear is
what I call false evidence appearing
real as Joyce Meyer her politic and it's
a case of sometimes because you don't
have your you're so scared you're so
tight with your money but you still
never have I sometimes think if you just
sometimes release like give to somebody
else even when maybe you have to
sacrifice yourself for a little bit or
invest in yourself buy that thing for
yourself that you're gonna use to I
don't know build something and some
people won't invest in their businesses
or their ideas because they're scared of
losing the money no no no invest in it
and if you invest and you so you were
also really so obviously you don't go
and start gambling and hopeful you know
it's a double up by 50 million times but
definitely invest in your own life and
you will reap financially for sure
so guys I hope you enjoyed that girl
problems it's very very different for me
doing that one actually but I really
wanted to share from my heart what I
truly believe I think is really really
important life principles and for
whatever you want to see next put a
comment below and we'll do that in the
next girl problems so thanks for
watching guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
