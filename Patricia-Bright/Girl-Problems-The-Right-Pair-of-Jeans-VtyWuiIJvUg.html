video is going to be another gob Pablo's
video and it's gonna be all about
finding the right pair of jeans online
you guys know what it's like when you're
looking for jeans and they come back and
they're too long they're too short
they're too baggy and they're just not
flattering at all and today's girl
problems gonna be a little different to
usual because I've involved some guys
from online I've sent a tweet out
recently and the guys from New Look have
also got involved so this is gonna be
really guys you've got Michelle I'm sure
you've got your girl problems when it
comes to jeans that you love to share
with my followers because I'm a little
bit more curvier so I've got wider hip
and a little bit of foam I find that
when I'm trying on jeans skinny jeans I
tend to go for a ski at the bloom and
then I get here and I get a bit stuck
all right okay if I do find the right
size there always be sure in the waist
and they don't at the bottom but shape
of jeans are like a great alternative if
you want that tightly tucked off
so guys we've got Evelina here who's
come all the way from Portsmouth and I'm
sure you guys can tell but she is lovely
and petite even smaller than myself my
DS are always hard too long for me baggy
and long flat or the match whole time so
I think for you a boyfriend Jean in a
slim cut would be absolutely gorgeous
not too overwhelming or swap you and
usually they've got turnips on them
already so you wouldn't have to do that
so guys here we have LR he's an
hourglass shape so basically my problems
with jeans tend to be that my family
gets very snacky
but not my father gets how you wear the
jeans getting saggy right and I want
them to fit nicely and to emphasize the
junk in the trunk
every girl wants good nice curve okay
yeah the highways are absolutely perfect
in creating that kind of an hourglass
figure and just accentuating the cars
that you've got already
so you've got candies here today whose
I'm sure you can tell is lovely and tall
and you could probably list off the
number of God problems you have she's
come all the way from nothing home as
well so really appreciate you being here
today I can never ever ever get the
right level and just because they always
come up too small because of my legs and
I have to roll them up and kind of like
make them look good and still try to
stay on trying these super skinnies
would look absolutely gorgeous on you
and I know that new looks have longer
lengths that would be absolutely perfect
for you
and not be too short
so guys we've got Gabrielle here he's
coming from Peterborough and I'm sure
you have some girl problems that the
girls online would love to hear
well basically whenever I look the jeans
they never fit me right on the top and
sometimes I don't look flattering on my
waist or on my thighs and sometimes
they're too long as well go for like a
bootcut which is kind of like if you
want to balance yourself out a pear
shape so my problem is usually when I
wear skinny jeans I find that they fit
perfectly on me when it is at the ankle
but the waist is just way too big and
it's just not flattering so I would look
for genes that are more fitted up top or
I'm gonna try boyfriend jeans and see
what they look like home
so guys thanks so much for watching I
know it's completely different but I
hoped you enjoyed it and you've got to
thank the girls who've come all over the
UK to be involved in this video and
share the love leave a comment below and
also let me know what pair were your
favorite jeans</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
