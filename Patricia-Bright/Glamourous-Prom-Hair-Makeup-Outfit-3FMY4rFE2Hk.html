you guys and lots of you guys have been
asking me about prom looks like my prom
season is in the air if you've been
watching me long enough you know that I
never had a frog and I get emotional
about it a lot of the times wanted to do
kind of like a prom get reading of me
like as if I was gonna be going to a
prom and just show you a nice makeup
look and a hair look it's a little bit
more glamorous than I would usually do
clearly if you're going to a prom you're
going to get your glamorous honest on
and I have got these gorgeous Hollywood
ways I've always wanted to like recreate
this hairstyle but I've never been able
to do it all the products and my outfit
details will be in the description bar
below but I'm excited for y'all and
feeling extra glamorous leather belt now
I'm gonna dance but myself in my room
from dreams I know guys yeah I hope you
enjoyed this video and I'll catch you
later bye so I'm starting off with a
bare face as you can see here I've got
quite dark eyes because I've run
eyeliner so usually I would just get rid
of any excessive eyeliner and I'm gonna
go ahead and use benefit Porefessional
just to smooth out my skin before I add
any foundation I'm using the Double Wear
concealer from Estee Lauder it's one of
my favorites and it's a nice good
coverage concealer I go ahead and use my
fingers to blend that in and then I'll
go ahead and put my foundation on as
well I'm using the tent identi for our
foundation from Lancome you guys know
this is one of my faves also I do like
other foundations I feel that this one's
gonna give me really good coverage for
say a special event like the prom so
moving on I'm going to work on these
brows that look very picky right about
now I'm using my brow gel in dick down
which is from Mac and I love an eyebrow
gel I think it just gives me really nice
defined eye brows and then I go ahead
and use a creamy concealer to neaten
those all up so I family filed a perfect
contour and the matcher using basic
needs the doubler foundation in a color
that is a bit darker than my skin tone I
literally love the way this finishes off
and it never leaves me with really harsh
lines and I've got on my nose and just
on my cheekbones as well it looks very
very natural so I'm just using a palette
which is actually from Sephora I think
it's Sephora's own brand and it just has
some really nice gold Browns and quite
neutral colors which are my favorite I'm
going in with a darker Brown in at my
crease just to give my eyes lots of
definition and kind of smoke it out I'm
also lining my eyes with an eye liner
pencil not my favorite thing in the
world to do but I really feel like for
prom your eyes need to stand out and I'm
using my liquid liner this is from
Illamasqua it's a really nice thin gel
liner and it gives me a really nice
defined line and then go ahead and use
the Estee Lauder mascara
I started to fill up my eyes were
looking a little dark so I added a
little bit more of the Double Wear
concealer just to brighten up underneath
my eyes and just neaten up any patches
that might be looking a bit hmm I'm
using these gorgeous lashes from a law
and they're a bit thicker than I would
normally wear but they just give me a
nice effect
finally I'm lining my lips with a key
coat liner in 516 and it's just a berry
and I just kind of blend that in and I'm
using my charlotte tilbury lip gloss
introduction which is just my favorite
for really like glossy sexy lips but
that is basically my face completes so
next I'm moving on to my hair as you can
see it's quite messy and I've liked
yesterday's waves in the funny thing is
that when I brush them they do look
quite neat so what I want to do is
recreate this but make it a little bit
tighter so next I'm using a new me want
to create some lovely waves I finally
got my hands on one of these and I will
be honest it's absolutely amazing you
have lots of different heads which means
you can create lots of different way
styles I did this over five days ago and
it's still wavy and it heats up very
quickly and it just gives you a really
defying curl well you don't even need
some hairspray so it also comes with the
heat proof glove which I forgot to put
on and I've got an extra special spring
discount just for you guys you can get
$100 off this set as well as 50% off
everything on the new me site using the
codes given all the details on the
description bar below so make sure you
guys check that out
so I finally end up doing the last bit
and adding a little bit of argan oil
this and she comes with the new McKay
along with the glove and rub that
through my hair can you see the waves
they look absolutely gorgeous and they
really do stay in place I don't even
need to setting spray I rub the oil all
the way through and just brush it out to
just stretch it all out and get them all
to connect so the best way to do this is
do want to carve in the same direction I
go ahead and do the other side of my
hair it's my favorite hair style
basically gel down my edges and meeting
them all up and that is basically my
look done and dusted so here's my outfit
it's a dress from River Island but that
is basically my prom not fun survive I
hope you enjoy in fact watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
