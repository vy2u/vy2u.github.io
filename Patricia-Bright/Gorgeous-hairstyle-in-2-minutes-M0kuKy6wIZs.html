I'm gonna do a quick hair tutorial and
it's like one of the hairstyles I've
been in my favorite hairstyles of late
and it's literally the two braids at the
front and it's because like my hair is
in desperate need of a relaxer and it's
really grown now and I don't like
straightening my hair but I put on the
top too much so this is a great way for
me to kind of hide the fact that my hair
is a little bit messy on the top and
just avoid braiding it and straighten it
loads and it's just a quick basket I
think they call it the basket braid or
something like that
but all I do is I grab a braid from the
front or some hair from the front and I
braid it and I braid it inwards a great
alternative is to do the French braid as
well
they braid it all the way down
and it doesn't have to be neat or
anything because this isn't any
hairstyle I'll take you from the other
side as well
and then I just decide you know I can
either wear it down or I can pin it back
but now I do next is that tree get
another pin make sure I push these bits
down to where I want them
get right like that
pin it back I'm on the other side pick
it back like that and then I just pin
them together at the back just so that
it doesn't loosen and one like that is
literally a really quick five minute
hairstyle it braids on the side so I
hoped you do that by</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
