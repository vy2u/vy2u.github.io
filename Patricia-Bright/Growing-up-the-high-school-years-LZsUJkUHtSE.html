different it's gonna be a book more of a
talking video and I thought to myself
that's why I keep flipping my hair
because it's like been freshly washed
she's like but yes sorry I was basically
thinking that I'm what I'm like
at that point in my life I've done
school I've done University I've got
married buying a house and doing all
those things and I get you know a lot of
people ask me Oh Patricia how did you
get here but I Brian I was like you know
what I would love to run through like
the early years or just life really like
growing up basically as a girl in London
like just that growing up and I hope
it's something that you guys can relate
to like I'm a bloody your kind of
growing up stories so let me know number
one if you think it's a good idea if you
would want me to carry on with doing
this and number two like I don't know if
I should do it like you know first
school first boyfriend first day or
first something or the other at
university all those kind of things or
whether or not it should be like you
know school University first job I don't
know think of it you guys tell me
because I'm not really sure what's the
best way to approach this kind of just
given the whole kind of story and I know
that some of you are like you know 13 14
you know just in secondary school now
and some of you are like same ages me or
even older than me and you've done all
the things that I've done and you can
kind of look back nostalgically at your
school years like I am and just kind of
enjoy it but some of you who want to
know how I worked out to the next steps
in life then hopefully this should be
good enough for you couldn't I feel
about good to watch also I don't I'm
gonna look at live broadcast with
Michael on this before so I'll put all
the links below but you can find me on
my facebook my Twitter and my conduit is
where I do live vlogs or you can ask me
questions and talk to me like laughs so
let's get started so I think I'm gonna
just a dress like secondary school or
just kind of growing up and then
secondary school so to be honest I I
grew up in a very like not a very shop
to talk about a fairly shelter tone and
I really I didn't go out like I didn't
really go out I went to school and I
went home I did go to play centre for
like an hour
two after school and that was it it was
home time you know there were some kids
like mom will go down going out no there
was no mom I'm going out anyway my mum
would just decide my ideas hey Luke sit
down I read your book
like there was no going out or anything
literally up until 1617 I really didn't
go out and something will think it's
like a bad a bad thing but I really
appreciate being raised the way what my
mom knew where I was I was at school I
was at home we do my book so yeah that's
kind of how I grew up so I was fairly
sheltered I did have my sister and we
have a own little fantasy and that's
probably why were so close because there
was no playing up for us we never had
friends like on our street or on our
road or in our area but we did a bit
later and I'll tell you about that maybe
in another video and then like friends
at school and our cousins so that was
kind of our main exposure and so that
was our main exposure to people outside
really so you can kind of tell what we
were like I was quite no no I'm just
gonna night I wasn't quite visitor so
the figures at school I was always a
very loud person like just funny that
nice always talk a lot like kids you
could tell I talk a lot and the report
that I always got was Patricia talks too
much she talks too much she talks to us
or she's disruptive because maybe I'll
be talking or doing some form of
entertainment in the classroom but
really actually being quiet and not
disturbing the whole class so I had I
started off in one second to school and
it was a really bad secondary school to
be honest and then my mum moved me out
into another secondary school and I
ended up joining with my sister seems
like a few schools my sister another
thing that's really weird when you join
in like the year after you didn't join
when everyone else joined and you get
into schools actually knew something
there which was kind of a friend of the
family I would say my cousin and she was
kind of part of the background so I kind
of ended up in that that kind of group
and you know everyone was really really
nice and everything obviously they're
going to be nice to their friends but
you know probably not as focused on that
let's do well Afeni fit they were
focused on let's be really really bad
let's bump class let's be really rude
and really really disruptive but that
wasn't I wasn't like that like I wasn't
in actually like that
and the thing is that if my mom caught
me I could just wait to get home and
find some tea
ready for me so I would be like I was
like kind of like almost like at school
who I was a bit like attitude II and
then a homeless really is for me and
then but afterwards just like this is
ridiculous that I don't want to be like
not in her way these people and you know
a lot of my friends got expelled from
school they a lot of them did not make
it to the age of 16 they didn't make it
to their GCSEs they did not make it and
I was looking at these people dropping
off like flies I was like hey I do not
want this for my life so I just like I
just did some reason and maybe this was
when I was about 15 14 15 I was like nah
not gonna live like this and I just said
do you know what if I seem a bit weird I
seem a bit awkward then I don't care
like if I'm a nerd I'm a nerd I don't
care I'm smart because they didn't know
like what my academic capability was
they put me in all the lower classes
because they just kind of dump you in
the lower classes as I'd come from a
previous school and literally within
like a few months I basically on all of
my subjects I moved to the top set or
the second to the top set and that was
just sheer determination and natural
ability to get up to those groups I
wasn't that good in math I was in the
third set in mass but everything else
was Group one or group two for schools
so I did talk to those guys and
everything but after a while I just kind
of started hanging over the different
group I would hang around with their
Asian girls that my friend was Fatima
like I didn't care I don't care if it
looks weird likewise a black guy hanging
on with Asian girls or like the hippie
group or whatever I didn't care I was at
you know I'm not trying to be a waste
goal and sometimes you just got to be
different than people actually
appreciate you like they know that
you're kind of weird or you're kind of
different yeah that's just Patricia now
I ended up getting kind of bullied if
you want to call it I couldn't really be
bullied because the way I am now is the
way I was I was just a mouthy and that
you couldn't intimidate me I was very
very skinny very very scrawny but for
some reason I was just extremely
confident and you can't you can't make
me feel small there's no way
got me into like problems so the girls
in the year's year above who who didn't
like me and they didn't like me because
I've been friends with the other girls
I've been friendly and I remember like
every time the blood we're gonna get you
and get you when we finished before I'll
still finish on GCSEs we're gonna get
you and every time they saw me they
tormented me comment me but me I'd be
like whatever I don't care if you're
gonna do something do something I don't
care and that's I had that attitude but
inside I was I was scheduled to give
these girls are going to beat me up I
was really really really scared but they
would have never known I was scared
because I was still I'll still argue
with you I was still at like I don't
care that don't get rude to me and I
thought but what I remember saying
what's your problem with me what's your
problem with me and they'll be like oh
you're friends or not so like what is
your your issue and I remember one time
after school one of the girls on the way
home one of the girls attacked me
and so yeah this evil really wanted to
get me and she attacked me in like in
and I was getting off on the bus
and she like pulled me she was pulling
me off but she really wanted to fight me
but for somehow my sister saved me and
like I stayed on the bus and the door
got close and the bus went and she never
attacked me and I remember on their last
day of school
I had a lot of friends who like Muslims
and they wore his jabs and everything I
took one of my friends hid jab put it up
these girls are not recognized and that
I was really really scared but again I
never wanted anyone to know me that was
a scare but obviously you know that
d-day came and I thought you know I
might get pummeled it but and I didn't
and I never saw them again and you know
and it's a day to tell you the tell in
general like the secondary school was
one of those things where you don't
really know who you are and sometimes
you're like following people but really
you just have to be yourself and if
you're awkward which is what I was then
be awkward people will appreciate you
for being awkward and if you're friendly
and if you don't want to fit into the
stereotype that people say you have to
be like that
you can't talk to these people oh no we
don't do that forget that that is all
all right nice and that's what I
realized I said you know what I'm gonna
be a rebel I'm gonna talk to who I want
to talk to I'm gonna hang over who I
want to hang around with that was like
my secondary school experience so I
could demo I could actually then do my
next what I won't it now but shouldn't
talk about college I like my experience
in like the first oh yes oh no woody
that again fun the first guy who I like
Nitin
but yeah and if those of you who wanted
to know what I got like at GCSE these I
had about two A's six B's and twosies
yeah I did try again but I wasn't the
best but I did make prefect like after
prefect rounds had gone because I was
still in that stage of being a little
bit rebellious and the teachers weren't
too sure about me but then after I did
this thing I was like you know what I'm
gonna show all the teachers who don't
think that I'm serious how serious I am
and got to the point that by the end of
the year I was a prefect and I was
awarded like you know most transformed
student because I just made that
decision I don't want to be ten ended up
