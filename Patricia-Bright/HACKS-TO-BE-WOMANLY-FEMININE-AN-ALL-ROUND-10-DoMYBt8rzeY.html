welcome to my channel today I'm feeling
it a bit prim a little bit proper
because I wanted to talk about the
subject of how to be wonderfully darling
how would you be warm innate trust me
don't go to Google to answer that
question because they're not so that it
comes up with most of us are completely
and utterly slipping when it comes to
being womanly because what I read on
Google was become a makeup expert learn
to be shy that's not going to happen and
smell good be outspoken pay attention to
the little thing avoid arguments and
never swear like it's not very nice
please when I read Google definition of
what it means to be feminine I'm a
little bit confused because I will show
a hundred percent of the time I'm going
to be a little bit on his hair I've
always backward the fact that I never
feel like I'm feminine enough or women
in another color not the most sweet and
demure woman like I am kind of loud
I'm opinionated and not that shy of a
flower and there's nothing wrong with
being that person however I mean all of
us are women Lee in our own special and
unique ways however I do think there are
a couple of things that every woman
could do to be a better them and to be a
better woman and you know represent for
that female demographic you know we're
out here we're great and we're popping
hello yes I'm going to show you exactly
what I think you can just add a little
bit of salt and pepper on top of your
amazingness okay another one learning
how to take a compliment and I noticed
some slightly random and slightly crazy
but I feel like a lot of us don't
actually know how to take a compliment
silences you look nice
I love your shoes and love something and
I don't want alright I am the worst
corporate for this and I'm the first one
to go okay I look awful don't don't look
at me and I don't know what it is it's
like fake modesty or not necessarily big
modesty but it's just that lack of
ability to take a compliment don't tell
me I'm the only one who does this I know
loads of people do this but it's a very
feminine trait to be able to take a
do it for man woman child or animal who
ever tell you you look good you like I
know thank you
so I genuinely feel the more you are
able to accept the nice things that
people have to say about you those
traits that you have that other people
appreciate the more you're going to be
able to see them in someone else and
give them a compliment and make their
day and the next thing I've got to say
is to educate yourself honey and I'm not
just going to talk about academia but
academia is so important in the day in
age where beauty is very important but
also what you have between your ears is
so important as well if you are able to
hold a conversation about something
solve a problem for somewhere be someone
who provides them input into changing
the world and making it better place it
is very important there's nothing worse
than someone who knows nothing about
nothing and you're just looking at them
like like just crickets try and grow
your brain grow your mind grow what your
interests are don't be boring you know
something about something and that might
be academia it might be beauty it might
be a good culture it might be aerospace
engineering who cares just have an
interest and learn to be better at it
they say that it takes someone 10,000
hours to be excellent at something so
you might as well start putting in the
work right now this is a great way to be
womanly it's a practical option here
honey practical and it's to wear the
right underwear honestly when your
underwear if it's correct the struggle
is so absolutely unreal it's very
annoying
and a lot of us are actually going
around wearing the wrong size bra wrong
size underwear just ill-fitting just
you've got extra over these hanging or
your bra too big just rag them what you
need to do is find yourself in a
Victoria Secret or where they sell
underwear nowadays and get yourself
properly fitted up honestly a good
fitting bra and good 15 knickers is
really going to change your life you're
going to throw like a new one honey when
you got that underwear that just fits
right right nicely those girls are
sitting you're comfortable you can run
you feel free oh my god the breezes
hitting you in the
places trust me and I like wanna lie to
you I swear it's been on while since I
got the right fitting bra and I have my
boots change here and there and a baby
and then I got that right - in blood you
can't tell me anything when my bra fits
right you cannot tell me a single thing
so ladies get yourself one of those
shots sort out and it must make you feel
really good next point is to know your
body and as a woman you probably know
the impact that your remotes have on you
is actually kind of crazy and PMS is
real PMT and real but it's actually
where people can change that
personalities based on their cycle and
I've talked about this before the fact
that I actually stopped hormonal
contraception because I felt like it
wasn't the right option for me and the
reality is that a lot of us don't even
know how our bodies are working how our
bodies are functioning so when we're
feeling a bit down or bit grumpy all
these different things that happen to us
a lot of the times they happen not just
a little as outward things but they also
happen because of what is going on on
the inside
commonly I use an app called natural
cycles which is the world's first and
only certified contraceptive app and
basically what I do is I take my
temperature every morning and I plug
that into the app and the whole way it
works is that your body changes ever so
slightly specifically in temperature and
also in like the nucleus and that kind
of stuff it changes throughout the month
and I have quite a steady and consistent
size for so it is quite easy for me
however what I found is that it really
helped me to just stay on top of what my
body is doing and what's happening I
know that I have three days I like happy
to go in with the hubby you know just
dive in there my green days my red days
I have may need some additional
protection and a certain day certain
people know talk to me and they know
don't part something like today is not
the dick today and not the day okay but
you know we have to give up on that
finals like the almost is very real and
I don't want to make light of it because
the reality is that almost do play such
a big role in women's life
deception played such a big role in
woman's life and it is important to take
control and work out what is best for
you to do you may find an option that
works for you but if you do purchase the
one-year subscription you can also get
the thermometer for free okay this one's
very important and it is to take control
of your time now I raise my hand I am
the kind of girl who when my cell
friends call me
I play every six down a stretch out and
I will knock her away for an hour like I
don't have anything to do and I always
thought people call me don't text me I
don't respond to Texas and I'll school
like that I love to have a chinwag
however you need to take control of your
time it's not everything that you have
to do it's not every phone call yes the
answer it's not every event you've got
to go to and also you have no order when
it comes to your day I've had to learn
this I need to have my fish or not and
what I actually do is I do
almost like an hour-by-hour plan of my
say I do it on a Sunday and I actually
just break down the key tasks that I
have to do and I literally put a time
box in to make sure that I've achieved
those tasks and it might sound really
sad but look at the end of the day when
I'm unable to take it off I feel amazing
now when I didn't do that I realized
that my day would run away with me I
wouldn't really know what I was doing a
little overwhelmed I feel like women we
have our houses in order and if we don't
we need to okay my little bit of advice
is to take control of your time plan
your hours plan your week splat low life
and I feel like there's so much more you
are able to achieve when you take
control of your time another random one
but what I think is really important and
this is around music and I realized that
when I listen to music by strong women I
feel more like a woman like it's not
good and I really don't listen to any
music that I found this empowering to
women or judgmental or winning or
defining women how they should behave
like I'm just not here for any of it but
I love me some obviously Beyonce of a
sea Vienna I love me some girly pop
music I would be doubling in the shower
I would die in my room while I get my
stuff done
I don't by the time I've finished listen
to that music I strap
on my house like I'm actually God's gift
to this up and it's all good there is
nothing wrong with that I don't know
like what you listen to them what you
take on board especially as a woman has
such a strong impact so make sure you're
trying to listen to something that
positive towards women makes you feel
warm on the inside also if you have a
date you know this into that right music
is going to set the pace perfectly for
you you never know I feel like you kind
of emit a better feminine energy which
mine you know
bag the boys are too much worn you know
hey my last tip is in regards to your
body language and your posture and just
your body and how you use it in general
right and my husband is a
physiotherapist so he tells me this is
the right thing to say and it is really
to look at how to hold and how you carry
yourself and I've mentioned this before
when it comes to power posing literally
if you're going to have rounded
shoulders you're going to be down like
this often you're going to feel a bit
crappy right you're not going to be like
in your best move however just literally
lifting up your shoulders lifting up
your posture embodying yourself on that
Court is really going to make you feel
more empowered most women feel a bit
more sexy I always do this sexy shoulder
roll this shoulder here listen this is a
shoulder with all the power in it like
yeah well over a little toss me the shot
is going in the shoulder it's all in the
back of the shoulder okay you don't need
a bar me don't you boobs you just need a
shoulder no I'm innocent just let's do
what Patricia does but yeah honestly the
way you carry yourself
makes such a huge difference from how
you feel as a woman hey guys those are
some of my tips when it comes to being
you know more womanly
and here we are repeat womanhood is
defined by separate women as so many
different ways so I want you guys to
share me down below what does womanhood
look like to you because I don't want to
say it's just these things there's so
many beautiful multi-dimensional factors
that make a woman a woman and the more
we share the more we care so yeah thank
you for watching and I'll see you later
