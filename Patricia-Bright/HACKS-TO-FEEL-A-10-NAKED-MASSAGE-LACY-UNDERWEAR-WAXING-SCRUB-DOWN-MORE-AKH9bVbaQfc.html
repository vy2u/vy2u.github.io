like it's been a hot minute since I last
did a virgin journals but I kind of
needed some inspiration and I feel like
the last few weeks I have got my mojo
back got a little inspiration back and
felt ready to finally do another one and
I wanted to share some hats on how to
basically feel like a hundred percent
like if you're feeling like a - right
now how do you feel like an eleven and I
got to this day because I'm not gonna
lie I'm quite proud to say it I am
feeling like a twelve right about now
you know and sometimes people don't feel
like they can be boastful or say that
they feel good about themselves or that
they look great or that they're there at
the top of their game but I have no
qualms in saying when I look dusty or
like you know just like sandpaper or
when I feel like I'm at my very best and
I feel like there are a couple of things
that every girl can do to actually get
themselves feed in like their a game so
I'm going to show you how I like to do
that so number one I don't know why this
work but it does work get a pedicure now
you don't necessarily have to go to the
salon or something but I'm telling you
if you've got dusty looking toad you're
never going to feel great about yourself
and there were certain moments when I
look down and I looked at my feet
especially when it was like it was
really hot and I wanted to wear my
sandals out and I put my foot in my
sandal and I look down and I just felt
just this sense of Patricia why come on
now darling it's not necessary something
about just having somebody wash your
feet and you know get rid of all that
callus and dryness and paint your
toenails that don't get a lot of love
makes a hundred percent difference to
your well-being and I'm never really
someone who likes to show my feet but
when I have a pedicure yes everybody
needs to see my toes I genuinely say
getting your toes done or even your
nails done makes a massive massive
difference to your self-esteem so my
second hack is actually to exfoliate
your body lots of us obviously wash
every single day some of us even twice a
day but sometimes you need to go in with
a hard-core exfoliation and actually I
had one of these exfoliating massages
when I was in Morocco and I believe that
you can go to a Korean spa and also have
this massage where basically a naked
woman rubs you down and they like
basically put you in a steam room and
then they scrub all your skin like
there's no tomorrow I can't remember
what this massage is called but what I
remember is that I was stripped down by
some lady who was also naked and she
just kind of took everything off and I
was like right so it's scrubbing me down
but after I had done that I felt
absolutely amazing it's like all the
dirt and sorrows and bad times I had
just fallen off my body
and I think that if you take the time to
like have a little soak in your bath get
a big flat mate and just rub it all down
it's like nothing you've ever done
before it's so so good and I think
everybody needs to do that at least once
a week so my next hat is to get a little
shape up and I mean a little shape up
down below and you guys are probably
gonna think I'm obsessed with taking
care of your vagina but I basically am I
like to look after mine and I suggest
that all you ladies should look after
yours and I feel like when you're not in
your right state you don't you take care
of bits and bobs or you get a little bit
slack and I think it's time to go for
either a clean shave or a fresh wax or a
trim or a shape-up or whatever it is
that you like to do down below but if
you stop right now and you take a little
look down and you think to yourself oh
actually milady God is not looking as
you know fresh as it normally does you
know what it's time to get it sorted and
so I must let weeks go by before we have
a wax until we've got a 5 o'clock shadow
and it's not a good look but you
instantly want to feel like you're
getting on your a-game get that done it
makes all the difference
so another hack that I can't believe
really works and it's actually to switch
up your perfume if you're someone who
wears perfume daily you probably end up
reaching for the same one regularly but
a great thing that you can do is
actually change your perfume to either
an old perfume that you've got positive
memories of
out or a completely new perfume and
associated with something good
eventually when you use the perfume so
much you don't actually smell it anymore
you kind of become desensitized to it
but if you get a new one or an old one
you're going to smell it all around you
and when you like spray it it smells
good and then when you're on like the
train or something you give your like
body or wear for your clothing a whiff
and you kind of get that sense of just
feeling a little bit better and I find
that when I switch out my perfume well
it's just it's just such a really nice
feeling I just feel great about it and I
think it's something that everyone
should do like every month or so and it
never saying buy new perfumes every
month but if you've got an old one or
wanna go mum's one or one of your
friends one there's probably going to be
some really nice positive memories
associated with a new scent
so my next hack is to keep your
underwear beautifully tantalizing and
nobody needs to know what's going on
down below or underneath but you need to
know and I found that when I get myself
one when I go underwear shopping it it
feels kind of like it feels like not
naughty but it feels like because I'm
worth it and I think every girl should
go to them summers or Victoria's Secret
or the Senza and I know most of these
shots always have a two for two for the
price of three or two for one bargain I
was one of those girls who always end up
with like eight pairs of fresh like
underwear because they always have the
discount on well I feel like it makes a
little bit of a difference if you've got
really nice underwear that makes you
feel good when you put on your own your
everyday clothing you're going to feel
fantastic another way to feel really
good is to switch up your hair which is
what I did recently if you haven't seen
it I've gone for a nice blunt bob but
you guys know me I switch up my hair
every single time and every time I feel
like something isn't quite right with my
life I change my hair like when things
aren't right I'm like notes time for
short hair long hair curly hair brave
there's something about changing up your
hair that changes up your mindset and I
know loads of girls when they go through
breakups they get their hair cut some
girls when they really want to change
they cut in a fringe or something
like that but if you're feeling a little
bit stagnant and a little bit hmm go for
a crazy little haircut even if it's a
change of color or something like that
and be careful though go to professional
mortgage actually I say go to a
professional but sometimes professionals
can jack up your hair so definitely get
an idea of your face shape and the kind
of hair style that will suit you but
there's nothing wrong with being a bit
daring and just giving yourself the chop
my final hatful feeling on a hundred is
basically to switch out your lip color
as well and I know this might sound
really strange I'm the kind of girl who
likes to switch out my lip color all the
time and I feel like I go for a stage of
doing really boring lit and then if I'm
feeling really good
I'll go dramatic I'll go really glossy
I'll go really bright I'll go metallic
I'll do something that's gonna really
change up my face and I think you know
what make up more or less days to sing
especially when it comes to your bases
and stuff and for me I'm having a
dramatic eye shadow wherever and it
doesn't actually suit everyone but I
think everyone can do something to their
lips and look like a million dollars so
guys there's a couple of hats that I
like to do to basically make me feel
like 100 make me feel like I'm an A and
I'm not gonna lie I have just been I
just been in that place right now and
it's nice it feels great to feel good
about yourself and I hope this video
motivate some of you guys to I would do
a couple of things that I've just
suggested that you can feel right you
are great and amazing and to business
and you always are but you know there's
a couple of things you can do that make
you feel that extra bit special so guys
thank you for watching and I will catch
you later bye
hey guys welcome to my channel I hope
you all do well so yes I'm looking a
little bit different because I'm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
