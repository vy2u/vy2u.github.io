and tasty sugar bear here to share you
my hair routine and some of my favorite
tips and hats when it's come to grow my
hair back since having a baby and of
course it is giveaway season so make
sure you are subscribed give this video
a thumbs up let's get it to 20k like
leave a comment and check out the
description box for all the details hey
guys so today's video is going to be all
about hair and you guys have been asking
me so much about my hair I wanted to
show you some really good and cool tips
when it comes to growing hair strong and
longer and healthy and I have partnered
with sugar bear hair and this product
has been absolutely amazing especially
when it's come to my hair journey for
those of you who don't know I had a baby
about seven months ago and as amazing as
having a baby is sometimes it takes a
toll on you and there's a thing called
postpartum shedding which I suffered
from badly and I lost all the front of
my hair it really thinned out my head
like a patch here and a patch there and
my hair was shedding and it was getting
a lot thinner but this has been so good
on my road to recovery as well as some
of the tips that I'm going to talk about
in this video and I've also got my hair
routine at the end so you guys can see
exactly what I do to kind of look after
my hair so I would really love it if we
could try and get this video into 10000
lighter because to be honest I was
someone who was quite embarrassed about
showing my hair right the whole process
because I don't have the thickest or the
fullest hair and I'm not going to
pretend that this ponytail is real
because it's not but I'm going to kind
of like work with what I've got you know
some of us have thinner hair right here
so for the some of us within a hair we
kind of want to maintain it grow it as
full as you possibly can and look
fabulous while we're doing it also if
you're not already subscribed to this
channel make sure you subscribe it is
free all you have to do is press the red
button and in the mean time I will catch
you later thanks watching I was good on
that's the way so as they say you are
what you eat and of course having a
really good diet and nutrition is going
to make a difference in the way you look
and also of course your hair I
definitely had to take a look at what I
was eating and how much nutrients I was
taking once I noticed my hair was
shedding a lot and that is one of the
reasons why I tried out the sugar bear
hair supplements now these are packed
full of vitamins so many vitamins and
particularly biotin which is well known
to be in the hair growth supplement I
really found that this has reduced my
shedding significantly and I have all my
edges back which decided to disappear on
me and these are gluten free they are
vegan and they are so tasty and easy to
eat and you know what's best they
actually work and I can totally vouch
for them but of course your diet is
really important and it will improve
your hair if you focus on it
so for me I love my bed especially when
it comes to sleeping and other things
but a great thing that can be done which
is a little bit of a weird hat is
actually something called the inversion
method now if you haven't had a bout of
the inversion method it sounds more
complicated than it is all it is is
basically about tipping your head upside
down for extended period of time about
10 or so minutes and allowing blood flow
to go all the way to your scalp while
giving it a run it's well known that
stimulated blood flow can increase hair
growth and improve your hair quality but
be careful because you could end up
feeling a little bit dizzy for me who
has quite dry and curly hair that really
needs moisture cling film has literally
been my answer I basically do this every
time I wash and deep condition my hair
deep moisture is essential and as much
as I look like a little bit of an
egghead
the softness I have after is amazing so
another thing I've been doing has been
massage and I've been doing this
religiously again it's all about
stimulating blood flow to the scalp
which is going to help promote hair
growth and honestly it was so good and
if you can find some kind of tool that's
going to make sure that you really reach
every point you can do I found this tool
in Sephora and I thought it was perfect
to use as a head massager especially if
you are a lazy girl like I am so you
probably know this by now and I'm not
probably hiding any secrets but my hair
isn't exactly the thickest or the
longest just yet but what I like to do
is to fake it until I make it
I am currently really loving rocking a
faux pony and I think for anyone on the
hair growth journey things like this I'm
really good it just has two clips and
then it'll mesh for my bun and I flip it
in and pin it on it is so easy to do and
gives me some extra length and
glamour which is something that I quite
like and I don't naturally have it I
will fake it until I make it now it's
not exactly perfect but personally I
love it and when I have my ponytail in
you cannot tell me anything like I'm
Beyonce I'm Rihanna
I am everyone all-in-one and fabulous
and I love it so this is my secret to
avoiding breakage and I know lots of
people know this but they probably don't
do it as much as they should and it is
wearing a satin and silk scarf I have
mine in my bag with me on a regular
basis so four times and I'm on trains or
falling asleep I always make sure I have
a sateen scar it's something about the
setting that really stops moisture being
drawn out of your hair especially at
night and it prevents that rubbing that
causes breakage it's so easy to do to
just fold in a triangle and just clunk
on your head and they're really nice and
cool ways to wear it
but I choose to wear it just like this
really easy so moving on to my personal
routine and my hair is that natural so
meaning it doesn't have any chemical
relaxers in it so it's quite coarse but
although it looks quite thick it's
actually quite soft and bouncy and curly
and I really like to use sulfate free
conditioners to avoid stripping my hair
of moisture so my hair is prone to
dryness and obviously using products
that prevent that happening is really
important and my edges I try to
moisturize as much as possible because
they're very examined when I rinse up my
hair I go ahead and put a deep
conditioner in and I find that this is
just for that extra moisture and makes a
huge difference and as I mentioned
before cling film is like my favorite
after that I normally find that my hair
shrinks up a lot but it's usually
because it's really moist and a feeling
ready and once it dries and they're dry
for about five minutes and as you see it
shrinks up even more and I use a ton of
products to get the results that I want
but the whole thing to me is making sure
that I've got moisture in my hair when
it comes to styling my hair creating
small sections is essential as
mentioned my hair shrinks a lot so I'd
like to stretch it out using a
blow-dryer I normally use my DHD blow
dryers on call just to give it a nice
little stretch and I like to use a boar
bristle brush this is also from GHD for
me they've got like the best hair tools
and it works with all hair types so when
I'm able to do this I'm able to
basically stretch out my hair and it
makes it much easier if I want a
straight hair style so my hair is
natural but I like to wear it pressed if
I'm going to wear it out
just because I feel like it avoid
tangling on the ends and it's I don't
know it's just the hair style that I
like to wear I try to avoid heat and I
do it about once a month so if I'm not
wearing it straight it will be in a
ponytail as I'm wearing a faux paux knee
I wanted it nice and sneak I've actually
really don't have to kind of straighten
my hair myself and it's taking a long
time
normally this whole process takes about
two hours so it is quite long and I try
and do one pass now once my hair is
straightened I've been really loving
wearing it up in this style and I try to
put a little bit of edge control on the
very front as I do have a couple of
flyaways because this is the area that's
just growing back but I'm so happy with
there and everything and I feel like you
can bobby see that my hair looks just a
lot thicker and healthier than it's been
in the past and I use a little tooth
brush just to soften the edges and here
is my faux Pony which is literally my
favorite ever so I just click that in
and I am done and this is like the look
I've been rocking and absolutely nothing
so simple and easy and that is my hair
routine so I hope you enjoyed that and
