today's video is finally going to be
about the hair for those of you who
don't know I had a get did a video a few
few weeks ago in regards to the hair
that I wear and yes I've got some new
hair right now as you can see this is my
new holiday hair so sorry
if I get exciting with myself yes I did
a video a few weeks back about having
some hair and I've received over 120
messages I had so many messages I just
sent out a generic mail to everyone
giving them the details on the hair and
I ended up just sending back you know
that very day so I just um made another
order because I thought to myself okay
people really want this so many people
didn't get any or you know didn't get
back in time before the hair sold out so
I bought some more because I made
another order I was ordering my own hair
so it makes it cheaper if I just get
loads all at one time or something like
that so I've got some hair now as you
can see and I've got about 30 to 40
packs of hair so anyone who wants some
it's going to be first come first serve
as it was the last time and this is not
the best way to sell it
I probably I'm gonna do a website at
some point in time when I can get myself
together and do it and but for now I'll
just do it like this I may not do it
that regularly because I don't know
we'll see we'll see how it goes and so
people wanted big list questions they
asked was how many packets of hair do I
need what limits took can I get it in
how much is it and what colors is it in
okay so I am wearing one and a half
packs on my head right now so this is
act as the packs are very very full but
I don't like mine too thick and I've got
12 inches on the top and 16 inches on
the bottom so I could get more of a
layered look okay and but I would say
definitely you need two packs for those
who like really big hair then I'd say
you could go for three packs or two and
a half packs and then save the other
half for another time
right now I've only got 12 inches 14
inches and 16 inches and I did so I did
have 18 inches but I sold them
and when when I wanted to make a new
order the guy didn't have any more 18 at
the time so I just said okay forget
about it let me just get the ones that
we've got now okay 12 inches is 32
pounds 14 inches is 37 pounds 16 inches
is 47 pounds and 18 inches is 62 pounds
usually okay
but I don't have any 18 inches you can
find out how much that is in US dollars
if you just copy this currency
conversion tools online and I will ship
to everywhere in the world so to the UK
it's about three to six pounds depending
on what I use to do us I think I said it
was $12 I think it's $12 to ship to the
u.s. to Europe will be about eight euro
and then anywhere else will be about
twelve to fifteen dollars I will tell
you at the time maybe it's cheaper to
ship to some countries and that's what I
would do from now on the hair only comes
in this color okay this is a natural
black so some some very so some are a
bit lighter so a bit darker and just say
if you want something that's a bit
lighter or bit darker but really it
always looks like it like this and this
is because this ham is not colored or
processed in that way as usually
coloring and everything actually dries
the hair out and that's why hair becomes
very frizzy and France orders okay so
this is like the natural processing
sometimes you may find a few gray hairs
I can't deny it maybe two or three in a
packet of hair I don't bother about it
and just pull it out and this is what
you're going to get with the natural
product like that and the packs are
quite full take you can see this is a
pack here and it just does just take us
lightly at the ends just to give it more
of a natural natural look it's kind of
how it's being created is there anything
else I need to tell you no limps price
transfer well delivery costs Conner's
yep I've done it all so alright okay so
how will you go about um paying for this
well just send me a miss
search and I will be taking payment my
paypal as PayPal is the safest way to
transfer money obviously if you have any
issues then you can put it get it
straight back into your PayPal account
you wouldn't have any issues but you
know I'm not going to give out any
account details and I don't want anybody
else's account details so yeah it will
just be via PayPal in the meantime as I
said I probably may you know try and
sell this on to a website at some point
inside but you know let me just get my
bearings first you know that's it so if
you are interested in purchasing there
you can send me a message I don't think
there's anything else you may need to
ask me about it really I hope not
because some people asking me the same
questions over and over so yeah I hope
I've addressed everything and yet just
send me a message if you want it and
it's gonna be first come first serve
there's thirty to forty packs so you
know you do the math and just get back
to me as soon as if you want it so
thanks watching bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
