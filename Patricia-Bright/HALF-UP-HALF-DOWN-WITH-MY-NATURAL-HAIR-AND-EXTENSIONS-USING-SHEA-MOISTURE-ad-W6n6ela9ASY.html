I'm going to do a tutorial a hair
tutorial I feel like I do a hair
tutorial basically once a year I wish I
did them more but I never really get my
natural hair out which i think is really
strange will Comanche started on YouTube
by sharing like haircare like I'm
obsessed I still am obsessed with hair I
just don't do it as much as I do
beauty on my channel but I wanted to do
a hair tutorial today and show you how I
create this look here which has been
literally a favorite of mine I'm loving
wearing like curly hair loving wearing
my hair just off my face it kind of
gives you like a mini facelift and like
makes everything look a bit extra tight
and I'm literally loving it and I know
so many people know that I wear weaves
and extensions all the time but
underneath I'm not actually bald-headed
as I'm sure some of you might have
thought and I actually have a relatively
full head of natural hair that like
sistering can do all the things that
naturally likes to do and I love to
switch it up with weaves and extensions
and I feel like you know hair is to have
fun with you know do whatever you want
to do embrace it it kind of is reflected
with your start and that's why I play
around with so many different hairstyles
but I wanted to basically show you what
I do to like wash and condition my
natural hair as well as just throw on
this one piece I'm telling you if you
know how quick this hairstyle is it's
unbelievable ladies and gentlemen and
I'm also using the products on the Shea
Moisture range hey the reason why I'm
excited is because they are now here in
the UK they are massive in the u.s. like
I knew all about Shea Moisture because
of all the gods on YouTube and to hear
that they're here like got me excited
and they are being sold in super drug
now so I will have links in the
description bar below and if you don't
know about the brand get to know it's
sulfate free for your parabens mineral
oil or the nasty stuff it's not tested
on animals and it's got a really great
ethos it's a family-run business and I
just think that's absolutely amazing
and the products are just excellent so
I'm using the range from the Jamaican
black castor oil range and it's
basically the strengthening and
restoring got the edge treatment I've
got the shampoo I've got the Mars and
I've got the conditioner as well so I'm
going to just go ahead and show you guys
what I do to create this look and my
little piece that I just throw on at the
back here I kind of brushed it out to
give it a little bit more volume but I
just let this tutorial give you guys a
lot more insight and I will say please
do check out shea moisture in the bottom
because the here girl they are here get
a buy in ladies and gentlemen because
their products are excellent and it's
nice to see brands that are great for
natural hair but also you know you can
put it in your weave to make it have a
little bit of an extra evolve our boom
and you can put it in relaxed play or
chemically treated hair
I think that's lovely so guys thank you
so much for watching and I will catch
you later bye so the first thing I like
to do is to give my hair as shampoo and
I'm using the strengthening and
restoring shampoo from Shea Moisture and
at the beginning of a wash I usually
keep my hair in twists because it means
I can get to my scalp nice and easily
but also avoid tangling for my hair I
love to use shampoos that are gentle but
make me feel like my hair super cleanse
so I avoid things with parabens and any
nasties and this shampoo is absolutely
perfect after that I'm going in with the
treatment mask and this is really cool
because it's got sheer butter minute and
keratin which is great for strengthening
week care and I do sometimes have a
phone breakage so I like to give myself
a treatment here and there I kind of
slather it all through my hair and then
I leave it on for like 10 to 15 minutes
and I just stay in the shower so after I
rinse off my hair feels super moisturize
but also strong and because of my hair
type I really do have to keep it as
moist as possible and it makes styling
much easier so sticking with the
moisture theme I'm using the leave-in
conditioner as well and I use this just
before blow-drying or styling and as you
can see the shrinkage is so real
all with my hair type but this makes my
hair nice and easy to blow-dry so
blow-drying usually takes me about half
an hour and I'm doing it in an upwards
motion because I want to do a half up
hairstyle you can see that blow-drying
will just stretch out my hair nicely so
I actually ended up finishing this look
the next day and I braided the back
section of my hair and just segmented a
section at the front I put in the edge
control treatment which is great for
kind of strengthening and looking after
the edges and sneaking them down and I
also use my sleek brush which really is
necessary to get a smooth finish for my
hair type and I'm just going to use a
bubble to basically making it open and
I've got different hair styles where I
do either one bun or two buns but this
time I've just done the one bun but the
principle remains exactly the same I
know lots of people asking me on my
snapchat so I tried to make the pouf a
little bit you know round so I can
secure my hair extensions around it now
this right here is the piece de la
resistance and this is my white hair I
think the texture is called Y cup I have
a link in the bottom but what I have is
a basically a 1/2 unit and if you guys
remember when I was wearing curly hair
about a month or two ago this is the
exact same piece and hair extensions and
what I do is I just flip it and attach
it to the back and pin it down and then
from the top I take two sections and
wrap them around the bun so if I'm doing
a middle bun it works even if I'm doing
two buns I do the exact same thing and I
just use pins to hide any tracks or
anything but I'm telling you this
hairstyle takes like five minutes I go
ahead and add some gel at the front as
well to create the baby hairs and just
to kind of make my edges not look so
random so I just end up poofing out my
hair extensions a little bit more using
my hands and that is my quick and easy
half up and half down hairdo
so guys I hope you guys enjoy and I will
see you in my next video bye guys
today we are talking about how not to
give a now I am NOT someone who swears
but I feel like this was the word that
had to be used for this and I'm not
going to use the word throughout this
video because it's just not ladylike</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
