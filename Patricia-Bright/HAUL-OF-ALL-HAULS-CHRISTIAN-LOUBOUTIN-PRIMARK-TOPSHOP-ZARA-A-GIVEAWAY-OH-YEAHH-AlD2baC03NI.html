a massive haul like my biggest and best
this haul ever so as I always say get a
cup of tea and get comfortable put the
video on pause and just find this or
somewhere in that so first of all I
wanted to let you guys in on a website
called want worthy calm and for those of
you who are online shoppers and haulers
like I am like it is the best fight ever
you basically are able to save items
clothing from other websites into your
want worthy account I'm gonna come I
want worthy account below and a lot of
the items that I have gotten my who are
from I want worthy and for instance say
that item sold out or it's not payday
yet you can save it in your account and
when you've got the cash or they're back
in stock you can go back and purchase
and I have an amazing giveaway but I'm
gonna tell you the details about that at
the end of the video and we're gonna go
ahead and show you my goodies first so
the first thing I wanted to show you
guys was this necklace and I think I
showed it in a video before but me being
really absent-minded
I completely forgot to mention where
it's from and I've Instagram this piss
necklace quite a few times and
everyone's always asking me where is
this from it's from regal rose calm and
I feel so bad that I completely forgot
to mention it previously and it was sent
to me so thank you guys from regrowth
and apologies that I hadn't mentioned it
previously so now you guys all know so I
know what a lot of you guys are excited
to see is my Christian Louboutins and I
know my pronunciation is terrible but
I'm very excited that I finally bought a
pair I did not want to know anything and
I decided that I was gonna buy a pair
I've been saving up for a while for
something and I wasn't quite sure what I
was saving up for but I knew that I
didn't want a pair of these and I
thought you know I've got the cash let
me do it and you guys know I'm doing my
whole wardrobe transformation and I've
got a bunch of money that I've put aside
to do that and this was
the first things that I wanted to add to
the collection and these are the the
Bianca's in the 114th and I actually
went for obviously the duffel bag
everything's I actually went for a new
pair because I have so many black shoes
that are very similar that I just
thought I'm not gonna buy another black
pair so here they got and they're just
the really classic style they've got the
platform and obviously the red so and
it's like a really nice nude and I think
nude is one of those colors you can wear
with everything I'll probably buy back
pair you know in two years so or
something so I'm really glad that I
bought these and they are quite
expensive but see them as an investment
that's what I tell my husband they're an
investment you know darling so sticking
with shoes I've also got my JustFab pair
which I picked for March and their
moccasins I absolutely love moccasins
they remind me of my childhood oh that
my teenagers my my good good friends
always used to wear my fault she's so
cool wearing them and I'm wearing a lot
more trousers now and they look lovely
with trousers so that's these so next
I've got some items from H&amp;amp;M and I
bought this what is this cold brother at
the broiler and this really gorgeous
Navy and I was inspired to get a
bralette because of the Persian babe she
got a brand up from River Island that's
like oh my god that's so cute and then I
saw this one and I wouldn't have usually
picked something like this but because
of her I definitely picked one up this
dress this dress is amazing just look at
that oh yeah just look at that babies
it's got this gorgeous either leather
detail it's like a long bodycon dress
and I'm going to a wedding so I'm
probably gonna wear this with the the
Christian Louboutin shoes to the wedding
and I just love it
it's so flattering one of my best
friends has this dress and that's why I
was like yes I must be in astray it
looks so hot on her and finally from H&amp;amp;M
I picked up this necklace it's like a
really nice slim necklace but it's got
this chunky curved bit here so it's
and you're gonna be like a touch of edge
kinda that I must say guys this process
of filling my wardrobe has been like a
plan for a while so I put money aside to
do this and I probably won't be shopping
a lot for a farewell but it's a process
right so I'm also Primark Yalie I went
and bought a few bits in there they're
absolutely amazing you're gonna love
them
so guys this is really different for me
but it's actually a pair of heeled
trainers like Hill trainers Patricia oh
yeah I would never have bought these
right I'm really inspired by other
people it's really weird but one of my
friends had a pair from Zara and there's
our repair are 70 pounds and I saw them
in the box she was like showed me her
stuff I thought oh my gosh it is amazing
I knew them and then I saw them in
Primark for like 12 pounds I was like oh
my gosh Wow had to get them along with
that something else that's different in
these glasses
I bought these I'm in love with them
there were only 1 pounds if you don't
like them that's fine I really like them
even if I never wear them outside that
they can wear them at home like sit at
the table and like right so I feel
really small but Mike hates them I don't
know what do you guys think I really
like them and then these shoes is well I
bought from Primark again they're an
exact same Jeep from Zara and which is a
bit worrying Primark but we got a
luscious stuff it's so well priced these
are 10 pounds yeah there are 10 pounds
and I just love these they're just
really feminine and cute and great for
like spring/summer and stuff so yeah and
I like the red I'm trying to change it
up a bit you guys have to follow me on
Facebook Twitter and Instagram because
you will see me in my stuff a lot more
and these shorts were really popular
everyone was asking about these shorts
and they've got this really cool Aztec
print here and these are actually from
Primark as well they're about 10 pounds
I wore them on
holiday they're playing it in the back
but they're just so unique because of
that detail there and it's on that
pocket as well so they're really cool
so next I went to my beloved Zara and I
actually ended up buying a pair of
leather leggings or leather trousers I
don't know if you guys know my history
with leather trousers but they always
split for me I've had four pairs in the
past but I've got another pair from Zara
and these are absolutely gorgeous I had
to buy them they've got those pockets
here but then they've got real pockets
on the back and I have to wear pockets
on the back of like leather trousers
because if not it makes your palm look
humongous might just like big and then
it's shiny like a glowing ball of balm
night oh my gosh if you don't have
pockets what pockets that kind of reduce
it slightly you say that's great and
they're like skinny all the way down to
the bottom and they've got a zip at the
ankle and I like the fact that they're
not too shiny they're actually quite
matte and obviously they're not real
another trousers so next I've just got a
jumper from wrong way you guys know
wrong he's one of my favorite online
stores they've got some really unique
pieces and I got this fairy jumper it's
like a batwing jumper slightly cropped
nice big and cozy and I don't know how
springy is but I love it in your purse
or whatever now only thing I don't like
is that these shoulders are studded but
luckily enough they're on like thread so
I can just literally cut them off I will
take them off because of a stunt fan
anymore but yeah that is really cute and
it's the softest material ever then I
went to misguided calm this is now
becoming one of my favorite sites and
they have like really good quality
well this that's ok quality it's not my
crap basically and I just love it I got
this um midi skirt dress
yeah midi skirt yessum it's not midi
skirt dress midi dress and it's like
expect chord I hope you guys can see
nice it's speckled and it just looks
really really gorgeous and it's like got
an extra panel in the boobs so it's a
bit thicker but the rest of it it's
really really tight and just pretty and
that is like 12 pounds
like wow online I bought these trousers
from aqua now aqua is fairly expensive
depending on what you like shopping out
these chances were 120 pounds I did pay
hundred and twenty pounds I got them on
sale for 63 pounds that's my most
expensive pair of trousers ever but the
quality is absolutely like untouchable
this is like butter it's amazing and
that I don't know if you can see the
pattern is so unique on them and I was
like okay I'm gonna get them so next I
went to Topshop and I went on the
personal shopping experience and guys
did you know this is free this is a free
service so I when I find out about that
I think I watch someone's video about it
and then that made me want to do it so
first things first of these trousers
some of you guys might be like what
oh those Patricia because they are very
very bright I know but I love them their
pattern trousers as you can see I've
kind of got a thing for pattern trousers
now but these fits so gorgeously and
yeah pretty I also bought these leggings
I hope you can see the detail on it yeah
they're like an Aztec leg in these are
28 pounds and a kind of like a flop
slash velvet material and I write
emphasis it black in it kind of
understated but still quite nice it's a
bit bright and really sorry guys I
bought this salmon shirt and I don't
know if you can see it's got a pan look
like a boobie panel and then below it's
a little bit more sheer this is really
really nice and I just like shirts
nowadays and like salmon is like one of
my favorite colors so so then I bought
this blazer because I felt like I could
do with the new blazer in my wardrobe
and what I love about it is that the
style is so just the really classic
drapey blazer but the gray is like a
warm grey it's not a cold grey I find
that these kind of grays and shoot me
more hopefully this is not too bright as
well but it's a hi-low jumper and it's
in a nice gorgeous near
it's in a pastel blue I know great with
leggings or a miniskirt and they've got
loads of these really nice drapey vests
and I bought one in this fuchsia pink
hopefully it's not too washed out
because the sun's coming out but it's in
this fuchsia pick pink and I think I'm
going to get the cream one is wrong and
this tops really different for me
because it's a t-shirt and I don't
really like wearing around neck t-shirts
but I love this because I thought that
it was still really feminine it's got
the colors and like the materials like a
really nice chiffon material much more
she could tell but and it's got the bank
detail in the back this was quite
expensive but I thought it was quite
unique so next I've just got some beauty
products that I had bought recent news
I'm afraid a but you haven't seen them
yet you have wants me about them so
firstly if my new foundation it's from
Bobby Brown
and it's in a warm or not 7.5 and this
is skin foundation it's a really nice
foundation and if you've got wavy skin I
don't think this would be suitable
because even I have to put powder on and
I got quite dry skin but I really like
it because it's really dewy and this is
a foundation I'm wearing now I've been
wearing of late it's like my favorite
and the color is literally perfect for
me and then I also bought the blush and
it's a net 211 and I thought initially
that this was going to be too light for
me when the makeup artist and put it on
but it's just glorious I've got it on a
now and I love it it's so natural and
pretty so duty free I just bought one
lipstick from Mac and it's called plum
full and you guys know that I'm just
trying to let's get it out I'm just
trying to get a bit more kind of into my
regime and this is it here it's like her
a nice pretty mouth color it's yeah it's
really pretty and then it's a Victoria's
Secret duty-free and I've seen those of
people with these scents so I picked up
a red a red plum and strawberry one and
it smells gorgeous but it's quite sweet
but I like to eat smells a few pencils
that I bought in super drought super
drug is like amazing I think when it's
not going a lot more but
I bought the MUA blue line are some
people hate this but I absolutely love
blue iron right now and it's at one
pound but it's the most vibrant blue
I've ever used ever like it makes your
eyes pop and it's called royal blue and
then I bought two pencils one is called
raisin and one school cacoa and they're
from sleek this one is great on my
eyebrows and that's what I've been using
recently it's kind of a chocolatey Brown
and the plum fall I've been using my
nips as well so that is the end of that
Hall I know it was massive I hope you
