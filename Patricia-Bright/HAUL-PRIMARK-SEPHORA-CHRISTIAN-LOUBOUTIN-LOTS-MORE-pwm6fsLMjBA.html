safe
what happened around okay hey guys today
I have a whole video for you I'm very
excited I'm usually very excited when
there's a whole video to be completely
honest with you I have so many goodies
to show you from Primark to Sephora to
Christian Louboutin I've got literally
everything here for you so get
comfortable I always say this get
comfortable get a cup of tea and yeah
this is gonna be a good one Garth it's
gonna be a good one Joe that always a
good one in my opinion I love a haul so
enjoy first things first is Primark and
everyone loves a bit of a Primark haul
you guys might have seen this in the
last lookbook video I did these are a
pair of shorts and they kind of like
have this like they have like a flap
over at the very front they're
absolutely gorgeous I love the pattern
that's on them and they fit really
really well
and I think on on it there was a label
that was like wow five pounds I think oh
seven pounds actually and yeah I think
they're definitely a bargain but I
really feel like these the kind of
shorts that will last a really long time
even though they're Primark seven pounds
Hey oh wow oh no it's this this was the
Wow
Wow five pounds guys Wow five pounds
it's look it the leg was still open it
yes yes I'm actually wear this in my
next video it's such a little cute
bodycon dress with like really nice pad
pattern on it it fits really well I
picked up like a sighs yes size eight in
this and I'm actually probably about a
size 10 especially in like body conv
it's quite stretchy and it goes just
above the knees again if you're looking
for a convenient dress I like to throw
these ons when I'm running to the shop
or like I just want to go out somewhere
with a pair of trainers these are the
kind of dress dresses I love wearing and
it makes the body look quite sexy you
know girls who you know you know might
wanna hide that away from your guys okay
this piece I literally fell in love with
I saw and I liked
if she ran over there this has given me
completely not to John Wayne like hello
hello cut off sneeze or roll up sleeves
denim shirt yes yes next I found this
shirt I hope you can see the detail of
it kind of like this see-through like
long sleeve I love how floaty and like
loose it is and I don't know if you
could see it but it's got really cool
like the bottom of its really really
cool and then I bought another like long
vesti thing as well so now you can see
I'll see through it is on the black this
is exactly what the white looks like and
I love these kind of cutoff sleeves that
are low like that and it's got a really
high neckline again I think this is just
another nice summer and transitional
layering piece and this is four pounds
and then I found this maxi skirt again
as this is eight pounds and I really
wanted like a really long long black
maxi skirt and I found this one and it's
got two slits just down the side which
was really really cool mix it a little
bit more stand out I only spent 37
pounds I like what usually I can spend
so much running in like on a one shot
but no gonna do that this time it was
really really good so let's move on to
Sephora next yay
I've always wanted to do Sephora or I
see them all the time and I'm like good
have fun but I've got the Sephora today
hello
yeah it was in Paris Paris has got
Sephora everywhere yes so the first
things I got were from makeup forever
and one is this kind of like it's an
aqua Rouge it's a waterproof lipstick
lip gloss and it's got two sides it's
got the pink on this side pink I'm
wearing and a gloss on the other side I
absolutely love this I love the fact
that I wear it with just this side it's
a map and it's genuinely waterproof like
it doesn't come off but the only thing
is that your lips are really dry
unless you use the clear gloss over it
but I like the matte look so
now I'm gonna leave it and I'm
Instagrammer I did a picture wearing
this and everyone loved it I loved it
what color is it it's a color 16 okay
but I'll put all the details in the
description bar below
next is the make up for ever face and
body I saw the color and I said yes I
have a feeling this is going to be my
ideal absolutely perfect color award the
foundation a lot on holiday it's such a
good foundation next are these nail art
thingamabobs right a little bit
disappointed because I did buy three
different ones and I tried on one of
them already and I'm telling you that I
put them on within 4 hours they were
like fraying at the tips I was like what
is this but this one was made of fabric
so I'm hoping that this one isn't gonna
do the same but you know they were
absolutely gorgeous this has got like a
galaxy effects on it this is like gold
snakeskin but this is definitely very
ratchet I love it so fingers crossed
that these ones are okay so I also
bought the soothing cleansing milk for
face and eyes I used this while I was
away it's it smells really nice I love
it my face felt like it had been through
a spa and the night before when I use
this so this is really really good and
I'm like obsessed with cleansing gels
cleansing milk cleansing oils they're
like my favorite thing to have so I
bought this one I also bought this
triple action cleansing water and then I
also bought another one which is the
two-in-one waterproof eye makeup gel
remover oh I bought this lipstick for
makeup forever it's gorgeous it's like a
dark it's really dark you guys don't
really see me wearing dark lipstick but
sometimes when I'm feeling like you know
wanna be badass I wear like dark brown
to dark you know dark red lipstick I
just love the way they look and they
make me feel cool like do if that makes
any sense to you it's Rouge Arty's
intense and it's a color of 48 okay guys
okay guys this this is the bad boy this
is the thing that everyone needs I'm
obsessive nude and this is the Sephora
it's palette this palette is just
at this pallet just look at the colors
it's got mattes it's got brown say it's
got my pinky gold there it's got bronzes
it's got everything you want in a
pennant and then I was a brand there but
I haven't seen before which was called
black up which I feel isn't like a brand
that's a bit more for women of color and
I had picked up some nip crayons and
like jumbo lip crayons they're 2 1 and I
don't know what colors these are called
I'm really sorry I will find out and put
it in the description bar below but and
I got this really nice and over I'm
obsessed with lining my lips now like I
always line them and I line them quite
thickly because I found that it just
gives me a lot more shape I love these
and this isn't like a move and then this
is a dark brown so next I've got my foot
where I'm gonna start with the Nikes
first because yeah these are like my
first like really really nice pair of
Nikes and I don't know and I don't know
how to say it Mike's Nikes everyone says
it different but you know growing up
like we didn't have a lot of money right
I'm gonna tell you a little bit of story
and I don't know if you guys know about
Mercury's but my mom never I never had
Mike's I never had a d/deaf and I've had
a real book although I wanted them they
were my dreams but no no no I had
mercury and so did my sister Oh actually
I might share this in another video to
tell you one of the stories that I
haven't actually told my mom about this
but yeah but yeah my mom was not paying
seventy eighty pounds no trainers for a
twelve year old kids and I Jimmy I don't
think I've ever really had Nikes that
you can wear that I like stylish I've
only have two pairs which are actually
don't gym kit but I wanted like a nice
pair that could also be worn at the gym
but also many fashionable and here they
are no I was seeing making up songs like
I'm so sorry okay here they are they are
so cute I don't know what they're called
they are Air Max oh my MX's
this is the ghetto chick coming out
right excited about a pair of air bags
like air max 90
I'm literally having childhood memories
right now I'm sorry if none of you guys
get why I'm laughing like it's just in
my head I'm sorry everything and they
are black with a white soul and I've got
a little air bubble and there's a bit of
gray in it and they're so so so so
comfortable you guys know that I have
like a real big problem of actually
having really huge feet yeah my feet are
massive but I got these in a size 7 and
thank God my feet do not let my boat so
yeah that and that was another thing
growing up like because my feet were
really big as as an 11 year old girl I
could wear my mom's shoes like that's
how deep it was and there are times
where I did wear mom's shoes to school
look at me now I will need to show you
oh no I'm so down so I'm a Christian
Louboutins I have my second pair and I
bought a pair probably 10 years ago met
yeah maybe a year and a half or two
years ago and it's time for another
treat to myself I saw this pen I thought
that they were really unique and really
nice what I loved was the mesh so these
are see-through the back is suede and
the other ones I have are nude and
they're the round toe so I didn't have a
pointy pair and I wanted a pointy pair
like this so next I bought some bits
from Topshop you guys are gonna look at
me like why on earth would you buy a
leather jacket in the summer look can I
get too many leather jackets okay okay
I bought this leather jacket from
Topshop I love it the hardware so
minimal it's not like silver or gold
it's not bright
my sister has this leather jacket she
looks so cool in it I just want to be
like my sister so I bought this jacket
while it's still relatively cheap it's
58 pounds now when my sister bought it
it was 45 pounds it's not real leather
but it really looks really good it's
really thick now I don't think you're
gonna be able to see the detail of these
but I bought these white culottes from
Topshop these are absolutely gorgeous
they've got like a snakeskin print on
them but not like a garish one is coming
like
techstop gorgeous I have a blog post on
it check out my blog it's Patricia
bright : UK
wearing this it's so so gorgeous I love
it culottes
I love you and then I bought the
matching white blazer to go with it it's
such a gorgeous and a flattering shape
on so you guys would have seen this in
my last video it was the lookbook
and it's this absolutely gorgeous
sequined crap top from Topshop isn't
this gorgeous and the color light
changes its kind of iridescent pink I
love it I then also bought this crop top
it's got this nice like detail at the
bottom I love it you would have seen it
in my lookbook as well
it's another crop top but it's a longer
crop top for the days that I'm like I'm
not trying to add my time like 15 like
got my whole stomach on show this one's
a lot more demure from the mature ladies
like myself so you know what some is
like it's totally wedding season and I
got this dress from a virgos lounge who
do amazing amazing dresses and this
dress is so gorgeous look at the
neckline it's on their new line which is
the V label which is a lot more
affordable gorgeous I have one more
wedding to go to at the end of August so
I'm definitely going to wear this dress
there but it's so so pretty I love all
the detail on it and it's even got like
a split just down the middle or please
check out the site this stuff is amazing
they did send this to me as a freebie
and just to let you guys know the next
are these high-waisted wide leg trousers
from aqua aqua which I think are called
a qaq now and just take a peek at these
these are giving me seventies life but I
just wanted wide leg trousers but the
only difficulty I'm finding is I have no
idea what footwear to wear these and
everything I've worn looks stupid like
look so so stupid like especially when
you've got like these wide leg trousers
and then you elect some Pinto issue
coming out so any advice for any of hips
on how to wear like wide leg trousers
and what footwear to wear would be true

few bits as well from Oasis because I
saw them I said these are gorgeous

everything made of a really nice
material as well what's even more
amazing is that it has a matching top

scalloped hem on the bottom I'm not sure
if you can entirely see that but it's
got scalloped a scalloped hem and what I
love is like this the black piping
around the top as well I'm not buying
