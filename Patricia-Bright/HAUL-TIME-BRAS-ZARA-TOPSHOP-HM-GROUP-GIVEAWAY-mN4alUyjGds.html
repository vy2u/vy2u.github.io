it really hasn't been a long time but I
was gonna say that I don't know if I
said I'm hoarse now i think i'm fairly
recovered i had laryngitis and yeah it
was horrible i couldn't speak at all I
couldn't get words out and for someone
like me that's really really frustrating
but I am feeling a lot better and I
thought I would record a whole video for
you I usually do a whole video at the
end of the mumps and this is about right
for a halt but I wanted to let you guys
know that I'm also part of a group
YouTube girly giveaway and a few other
girls in youtube that contacted me and
let me know that they were organizing a
giveaway if I definitely want to be part
of it there are seven winners and
there's one grand prize winner and then
another couple of winners who will win
$100
I think it's gift cards but I think it's
toward anything you want so I'll get to
pick my extra-special winner who we will
discuss what you can get you know and
I'll link below all you need to do is
subscribe to all of our channels and I
think that's it there's a website below
that will allow you to do that but I was
like yes giveaway will give with the
know you guys do like them so anyway I'm
gonna do this haul and I hope you enjoy
it the first thing I wanted to show you
is this rail behind me and I've got a
blog now which is called murmur to stir
calm but I created this ray called new
things because I find that you know I
think I do shop a lot honestly and I'll
see you tubers we do shop a lot because
it's kind of like part of the process
and getting new things and showing you
guys what's out there but I was just
like I really want to be able to look at
what I've had or look at what I've
purchased over the past month and
hopefully it's not too much and you've
never seen a lot of these items because
I have been wearing them loads so we'll
get started
let us start off with wrong way actually
because I've been shopping a lot on
wrong way so first things first is
actually this dress this dress is
actually for me and it's absolutely
beautiful it's got fruit and leaves and
everything and like grapes on it I think
it's called a great dress and it's a
gorgeous shift dress however the
only thing about it is that if you are
curvy this is not for you because the
dress comes in one size and I kind of
curly slim and it kind of gets caught on
the butt and go ahead and right Rises
but if you're quite slim with a boyish
shape this dress will be absolutely
perfect on you and I just like how ripen
it is and whether is improving at the
moment so this is the first bit next bit
is this bangle and I love this I thought
it was really Chanel and I don't know
really elegant and very what's that that
show is it dynasty or something I don't
know that's what it reminded me of and
then I also bought this bracelet here
but you can't see the detail if you go
on my blog you'll be able to see a
close-up shot of this somewhere but it's
really cute it's got a little violet
stone in the middle so I bought this
waist belt as well it's like a chunky
waist belt with like this central piece
there you guys have already seen these
leggings which are from romwe and I love
them they have loads of really crazy
leggings out there and I was a bit brave
to get these but I'm glad I did I'm not
sure if I'm gonna wear them every day
clearly but they're nice and I bought
this sparkly top and I loved it because
it has this mesh here and then this
better the bottom this is great for
going out would look really nice if you
like leather leggings and stuff and yeah
that's that and then I got this virgin a
you guys have seen me wearing this all
the time I am wearing it all the time I
love it
trust me on top of a leather jacket it's
so amazing and it keeps you so warm I'm
so glad I finally got like a perfect
chilly I had one from Primark but I
didn't like it I think gave that away
actually as well and that's that they're
gorgeous and I know we're getting to
spring but when I saw this jacket as I
look even come off um autumn winter you
need this jacket so I bought this fairy
jacket it's a so cool I'm just hoping it
rains and gets a little bit chilly just
so I can wear it but if it doesn't then
I wait so next thing is this purse I
just bought this purse from Michael Kors
and
just needed a new purse basically and I
liked the fact that it had a zip section
and it's quite wide as well so I could
put notes coins everything cards the
card section is really good and I've not
had a decent purse for ages and I
realize I just desperately need one oh
this is a bit random for me but it's
actually um like bras and knickers and
stuff but I'm free all have a new I
don't know if you guys know who favorite
they are a lingerie brand I believe it
they French or Italian I think they're
French but and obviously they do like
bra sizes for like all sizes basically
and they're very good at what they do
and they have a new collection called
the deco collection and I find that
they've got basically really low a low
dip but really good support basically
and I bought the black one here's a gray
one as well you can like you can really
see what that dip looks like so if you
want that hardcore cleavage you can get
that cleavage from a brand like this but
if you have not very if you haven't got
much there's not much padding in these
if you have the cleavage and it's great
so that looks like that if you're
looking for a low dip and it's quite
seamless as well so for t-shirts they'll
be perfect don't watch my hair looks
crazy isn't it I didn't do it today Oh
from Topshop you guys would have seen
knees in my trousers video it's the wool
me young trousers these are these neon
trousers which we've got a really nice
pattern on them I absolutely love these
when I got them I was wearing them
straight away they are fabulous and they
fit so well so well and then I bought
this just the best really not not the
best the t-shirt here and you can see
it's got like lines in the stuff through
it and I thought that was quite and then
randomly I picked up some accessories
some neon accessories I think I was
inspired by the trousers so if the Sun
keeps coming in and now I can't really
do much about that but that's what they
look like but I bought some of their
makeup and this is the lip cream which
is called witty it's really nice it's
really really pretty I don't have it on
Nile but it's like a real
nice pinky color I'm so sorry that it's
a brat but yeah bats gorgeous
and I also picked up this kind of corny
orange lipstick called infrared from
Topshop and I haven't tried it on yet
hopefully I will and it looks good but
that's it there I love it
you guys know that I get my monthly pic
from JustFab and this is the bag that I
picked for um April and I thought it was
gonna be quite a deep tan but it isn't a
deep tan a it's actually more of an
orange tan but I think it's quite nice
and a lot more springy so if you're
looking for something a bit more
colorful that's it but it's a really
nice big bag and I love the shape of it
and yeah that's that there that was my
pick I love that and you guys would have
seen this actually in my get ready with
me morning routine and I bought my first
wire sell a little stick and the color
is number 10 and it's kind of a nude
color actually it's kind of a nude I
love the packaging and the packaging is
obviously well known fabulous and it's
just beautiful and it looks like a
really nice great nude for black skin
I'm hoping that it would it will go well
so it's more of a brown nude so next
guys is some stuff from misguided that
was actually sent to me and I was so
happy
well I actually picked the stuff and
they sent it over you guys know I've
been shopping on Miss go I did quite a
bit of late so I'm so glad that they
contacted me and like doing some base I
was like yeah yeah thank you
and I think some bits actually bought
myself this is when I bought myself and
then these are the ones the ones that I
um got sent i was sent so first of all
is this chiffon drake cape and again
this is in another blog post i put up I
absolutely love this when I saw this I
like I need this in my life because it's
like
that's weird I thought it was so
gorgeous and you could just drape her
over anything and I was just like yes
that's what I need and
basically for like a matador and I can
make shimmy it around and I was sent
this dress I love this dress it's like
such a cute schoolgirl dress and that's
that you can see the fabric and
everything and it's got little leather
cuffs and another color there and this
dress is so pretty it's such a girly
dress that's it that it's got these cut
out sections here which I love and it's
like pleated and it's such a pretty
corally pink this color is great for
like brown skin dark skin I don't know
what it is I think it just makes you
look so much more vibrant I just love
this but I almost forgot to show you
this bit from romwe you guys would have
seen this in the video this is from
wrong.we and it's so pretty so unique
and I was sort of surprised that the
color suited me because I'm very
hit-or-miss of blues and purples but it
actually looked alright I was happy than
that so next is hmm
and these trousers they're only nine
pounds 99 that is a bargain literally
look how good they are I love them
they're so pretty and I love the color
blue like down there down there that
makes me move it smoothly it's making
the camera do something weird as well
but yet those are those trousers they
look gorgeous
I love them and then I just bought this
white chiffon top just I like what like
basic tops it's really hanging and
drapey and I'm hoping I'm going on
holiday soon I know we've just come back
but you know but yeah this is this top
here which is really gorgeous I know
let's glow in the dark right now but I
love this and this jacket everybody's
been asking me about this jacket this
leather jacket is the jacket that dreams
are made of yeah I love it I love the
quilt on the shoulders I love the
pockets I love the shape I just love the
zips
I love everything about this jacket and
it's got these IPPs here now the only
problem with the jacket is that I've got
long arms so it's a little bit short on
my arms but that's fine I can live I can
survive and to be honest
was 99 pounds which is quite expensive
H&amp;amp;M but it is real leather and it's
really heavy it's really good quality
and I know it's the kind of jacket that
I will have for years my old leather
jacket I've had for six years and it was
like torn and everything is like time
for a new one so I bought this white top
from Primark you guys have seen it in a
previous video and it's just really nice
really good materials almost this it's
actually the same material as this is
our top which looks full of resin right
now I had to turn it really down so you
can see it without it glaring so this is
the zara top pick and it's lovely isn't
it it's kind of cropped and it's just
really flattering and then this is the
prime up top which is virtually the same
material so guys that is it for my haul
I hope you enjoyed do you make sure that
you do enter the giveaway you never know

grand prizes which I'm going to show
some pics of at the end of this video
