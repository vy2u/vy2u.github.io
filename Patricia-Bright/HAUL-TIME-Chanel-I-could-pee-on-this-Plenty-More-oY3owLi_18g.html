good language like yeah hey guys how you
all doing
so today I'm going to do a whole slash
favorites video because I don't really
do favorite and this hauls going to be
smaller they might use your halls and I
want them to get even more smaller
because I'm trying to save my money
so the first thing I want to show you
guys is my Chanel bag and I don't want
to show off or anything but obviously
I'm quite proud of myself for finally
buying one and I've always wanted one
but I'm the kind of person that I have
everything else if I start spending
money on like quite an expensive bag but
I've got a home I've got mortgage you
know I'm good to go really and I don't
have any kids
so I bought myself this bag and I bought
it duty-free so when I went away to New
York Duty 3 means you get about 20% off
versus getting in the store so I decided
all right has to bite the bullet and
it's in the lambskin no it's in the
lambskin and it's but it's in a large
size as well and I loved it it's got
this really cool shame there and this
has to be one of my favorites I've
actually worn it quite a lot but
initially I was like really like Oh
Precious about it but my it's a bag a
bag the bag it's gonna last forever I
just want to look after it and look
after it well so that's that next is
this jacket which I bought from
misguided absolutely loved it
the gray and the leather is just all me
and now that it's getting cooler but the
weather's actually been really good so I
can totally see me wearing this with
like skinny jeans and wearing it all
year round so I absolutely love that and
then these boots these boots have been
my boots and I wasn't so sure on the
quality when I saw on the website but
when they actually came I was so
surprised
you know how sturdy they are they're not
real leather but they're really cool I
love the design on them kind of like a
cowboy boot but not a cowboy bit and
this top I'm also owned is from
misguided
I love off-the-shoulder cut-off tops
because I don't really have much in the
boobie the boobage department but I
think that if I can try keep cleavage or
just so shoulder
oh yeah I've also got this necklace
which is from distressed UK and anyone
who knows me knows that I love feathers
and my things that are kind of feathery
which that makes sense like feathered
jewelry is so pretty and I found this on
there and it's so reasoning price I'll
put a link in the description box of
everything basically but this website
where I got this necklace from so this
is just one piece but I went on to the
motel website and I met I rarely show
in motel I don't know why I used to shop
motel but it's call most like it like
left my memory but I went on to motel
and I found a top that I've been wanting
which is I wanted something mesh and
cropped but with like a baby bit and I
found that just that I think it's a bit
too expensive it was 35 pounds but I've
been wearing it all the time and it's
just an item that I wanted so open
outfit is I went when I was away in New
York I just went and got one bit and it
was just this top here it's leather and
it's got a quilted design on it you guys
know I have a level obsession like I've
accepted it I love everything in leather
and my beautiful sister Marian she also
brought me these shots I'm gonna show
you them I hope you can see it looks
like she's off to Thailand and so she's
been buying all this stuff and I've told
her moring when he shot always shut for
me so she actually bought me those
shorts which are on sale on Urban
Outfitters website so anka darling why
we appreciate you so you guys know that
I do go on to she inside quite regularly
and lots of other online stores to buy
some stuff and I do get some queries
that people asking about the quality of
the fabric and stuff and I do think that
with a lot of these online stores is
that they can be hit or miss but it all
depends on the price if you're paying $7
99
you're not gonna expect you know Zara
material you're getting kind of what you
pay for so the more expensive it is
usually the thicker it is but sometimes
when you're taking and sometimes when
it's pictures you can't really tell but
for instance this jacket here I
absolutely love this jacket here it's in
the trend the pastels trend and I
decided not to go for pink went for
green that's kind of the thing I do and
it's like really warm really really cozy
really really thick as well so I know I
can wear this all winter and actually
this was fairly reasonable in price and
it's got lovely pockets so nice length
and I have so many black jackets that I
realized I really do need something that
just adds a bit of you know prettiness
in my jacket wardrobe so this blazer I
also bought
from she inside which is definitely more
for style I'm not gonna wear it outside
when it's cold but you know if I'm going
out and a night out or something I would
definitely wear this but it was really
pretty and just wanted to try something
that's a little bit bolder I bought this
jacket as well and what I saw was I can
had the furry bits on the inside now I
thought it would have been all the way
through but it's not it's just from the
collar but this will be a great jacket
for layering but I wouldn't wear it on
its own because it isn't you know that
thick besides the leather arms they are
really thick and you guys probably can't
see it because it's bit bright but I
love like drapey shirts in the high-low
shirts and this is like a really cool
high-low shirt in my classic white or
cream it's got a little fake bottom
pocket there but I love that and then
it's cross over you guys should check
out my blog which is mom and sister calm
I've got lots more fashion e things
there like outfit post when I've been
out and about if you want to see more
style things so another store that I've
been loving recently is a mango like I'm
very here and there with mango but boy
number one is the tartan skirt I love
this tartan skirt and like run I like my
blacks I like my whites I like my mana
tones and but I wanted to add some
pattern so this got was absolutely
perfect for me and a blue tottered
jacket as well now I'm not gonna wear
them together guys I'm not going to wear
them all maybe I am maybe not but this
Thompson jacket again you can see I've
got kind of obsession with wanting to
put something a bit different in my
wardrobe and I love that it's quite
expensive
this was 89 pounds so guys these are my
JustFab picks JustFab you guys though is
a monthly subscription service and I get
shoes or bats and their monthly and
these are my pick and I absolutely love
them they're much better than I thought
they were like when I had to pick them
on the website and it's got this kind of
never effect detail here and then he is
suede and then it also has like the
ankle strap and I think an ankle strap
it's just so sexy so you guys saw these
in my last video oh my
outfit video it's riding pants ladies
and gentlemen boys and girls I can't get
enough of riding pants because you just
throw them on I would actually wear
these every day like I have a blue pair
but I think the black pair for me are
just much easier to wear regularly I
absolutely love them I don't know what
I've been doing without them so I went
to age and then I D I have not been in
hating him for a very long time so it
was really nice to go in again and I
found this jumper which really did feel
quite Christmasy without being cheesy
and Christmassy because I have the stars
on there and the stripes top American
stars and stripes
there's no red I know there's no red
dyes I love this jump art it's really
cool I've got a blog post worm this as
well I think I've got a blog post
wearing this anyway and then these jeans
these jeans the camera's not doing them
justice
they're nice skinny fit them good make
your legs look like like yams I love
them they're so comfortable as well and
I love the fact that it's got this extra
detail here because sometimes jeans can
look a bit boring and this just adds
some flavor
moving on I wanted to show my iPhone
I've got fun you got the iPhone 5s and
but I wanted to show you this case which
I bought which is so it's so so handy I
was just looking for random cases online
and I found this and I was like this is
gonna be really really useful and for
taking selfies girls it's like selfie
selfie and it was $2.99 on eBay and it's
plastic but you know it's decent
something you guys know that Birchbox
sent me out to New York on a project and
we went to go and see some stuff from
the designers the ruffians and they were
wonderful enough to gift us with some
amazing jewelry and this is like
beautiful pieces that I like worthwhile
having I don't know world Verity because
it's quite glamorous but obviously it's
Christmas and party season I can imagine
me in like a little black dress and this
necklace but it's so beautiful I've got
two books that I wanted to show you
there's one called instant happy and
there's one called I could pee on this
now I like this stage in my life where
I'm just like I don't care if people
think I'm silly I just do what makes me
feel good and makes me laugh and yeah
yeah this isn't a book that's going to
expand your academic ability but this is
a book that is stories Kat stories and
all the cat pitches are so cute in there
it's just got this I know I'm so corny
what this cat book is just I like this
one it says I lick your nose I lick your
nose I lick your nose again I drag my
claw down your eyelids oh you're up feed
me this one but this cat book is just an
absolute favorite that just makes you
smell and there's also a dog book if you
are a dog person and this book is called
instant happy and it uses like visual
stimulus to make you feel happier and
again it's just got motivational words
it's kind of like the whole tumblr thing
but I like it in book form so don't let
a bad day make you feel like you're
having a better
life and the visual imagery is meant to
stick into your head so you remember the
phrases couple of other favourites is
the Loreal new skin perfection is the 15
second miracle cleansing oil now I know
about this year the Shiro Umar cleansing
oil which I must say is absolutely
amazing but it's expensive really like
60 70 pounds expensive and I had this
sample and I started using it and it's
the most amazing thing for makeup
removal in the evening but I love this
because you that all was quite warm when
you put it on oily turn the tap warm it
off and it just rinses off and your face
feels so moisturized afterwards
especially now as it gets colder I
always get dry skin also another thing
you guys know as I've just said it's all
about having that moisturized face and
feeling like more plump and not dry and
this is the heel gel face firm replenish
moon and this is really like I love the
consistency it's really thick but it's
not greasy it's not like oily but you
really feel like your face is
moisturized when you use this I've been
using it at night and I love it final
couple of favorites are the L'Oreal True
Match and I use the color
cappuccino you guys don't really ever
see me using drugstore makeup but it's
because I'm lazy and it's like okay Mac
works yeah Mac but somehow I had this
and I tried it and I absolutely loved it
like it's really good it reminds me of
my match masters and it's not so red
because sometimes I feel that their
match masters gets very very red in
color but this is really not red at all
and I'm impressed
finally it's this palette here that is
frumble it looks like a Western world
palette but it's actually from black
opal I just saw it and I thought oh let
me try this and it was $1.99 it was
really really cheap and I thought that
you know if it's cheap it's probably
useless but I cannot believe the color
payoff on this I like to use a little
bit of the purple in my crease not today
but another day and it was amazing and I
was like wow this is actually a really
good palette that was so cheap and
drugstore so
I thought I'd show you that so guys
thank you so much for watching if you
guys like it when they show the clothes
and stuff then I'm gonna keep doing that
but just leave me a thumbs up and yeah
and any comments finally I wanted to
announce the winner in my autumn trend
video I said that I would just give away
something randomly I have picked someone
called green I believe it channels
called Green Street Green shoot but I'm
going to send you a message and you can
win that item and we can work out how
you get it so guys thanks for watching
and I'll probably do more giveaways in
the future but they'll be super casual
like that and I know guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
