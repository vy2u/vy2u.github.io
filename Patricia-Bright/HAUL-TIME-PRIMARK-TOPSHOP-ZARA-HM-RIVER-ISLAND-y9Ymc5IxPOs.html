big one again you guys know I've been on
this massive water it clear out and
stuff and trying to buy new things and
I've been on this for about three months
I've probably offloaded about eight bin
liners worth of clothes and I still have
another four left and I also wanted to
let you guys know that I have finally
decided to do a meet-up and I've never
really done a meet-up
before but yeah I'm gonna do what I'm
gonna do on on home territory so here in
London I will be doing a meet-up the
21st of this month and I'll be at
Selfridges who have agreed or have
disgusted me about holding up a meet up
there in Bond Street but I will give you
a bit more detail in their near future
so let me get on to my goodies that I've
got in my haul the first things first
let me just go ahead and show all the
things that I picked up in Primark I
picked up this and floral floaty skirt
and it's in a white with like blue it's
got blue flowers and I've noticed that I
love like the white and blue kind of
nautical theme a lot I've got another
dress on aids or switches like that and
it looks just like this and it's got
this cute little brown belt as well I
picked up this and cream skirt and you
might not be able to see but it's got
these little bubbles and textures on it
and it's like an a-line skirt I love
this kind of stuff for work just because
I can just throw it on over like a shirt
or a smart top but it's quite floaty and
airy I love that and it comes again with
another little belt and this was ten
pounds they also bought the same skirt
in a size 10 as well because I just
thought I've got the Queen let me get
the navy and it's only temper
of this top and I'm going to I'm not a
big Primark shopper and I'm a fairly
smart shopper so this top does this top
look like it's from Primark no it does
not right the material I bought this one
in the white about two months ago
washes like a dream but it washes like
new I let you in and bought three of
them because they're actually really
good fabric really nice is it's a
polyester but it washes and always comes
out looking the same
it's got this really nice applique
necklace necklace neckline and then it's
just a t-shirt shape shape but it's a
really flattering t-shirt shape and it
looks likes like just over jeans over
trousers or tucked in under a skirt so I
put it in this kind of movie color and
then I also bought it's a slightly
different shape on this one but it's got
again a detailed neckline and if I got
bored of this one day I can always um
stitch it but it's again that same
really nice material and I bought it in
the pink so this is like basics that I
would wear to work everyday and I also
bought this top which has got this
really cute pattern detail on it and
it's got these like little bubbles on
the sleeve and on the very bottom and I
thought this would be really nice for
like some shorts or over my bikini on
holiday and it's got a sheer back as
well finally I just picked up some shoes
that I could wear to work and they're
just little flash you what I did like is
that it's got this little chain here and
then it's the chain across there so it's
just like that and that's what these are
really cute they are quite you know
cheaping material rubber sole but these
are grateful working in walking into
work and maybe if you don't want to
change into heels then you can like I'm
just wear these around the office and
still look under decent so okay just
look how creepy that bag looks Topshop
man that cat is ugly and I like cats
because you guys have seen my cat
calendar in the past anyway yeah I only
bought one thing from Topshop it's
really cool cropped in your vest and I
think it would be perfect for when I go
on holiday and again just with a pair of
shorts and this was 15 pounds
I think the backs really cute and it's
just really nice and floaty so guys I
want to show you my JustFab pick this is
my pick for May and it's this
this satchel it's so gorgeous it's so
bright and it's great for like you know
spring summer and just it carries so
much stuff in it and it's from the
JustFab site you guys might get a
monthly pic from there I think this is
one of my favorite pics and along with
another black bag that I have got over
there and I'm excited to see what I've
got for this month I've got some wedges
coming in so yay but this is this bag
and I'll put the link to everything that
I can find in the description below
moving on to hmm and some of its that I
bought from there and I went and bought
this miniskirt I've just been looking
for a few basics that I can just throw
on here and there and they've got this
miniskirt for 399 four pounds and it's
just a nice Jersey material the one
thing I found with this skirt is I
bought it in the past but it comes up
really really short and really really
tight so I actually ended up getting a
size 14 when I'm actually about a size
10 also in preparation of my holiday I
picked up this maxi dress it's just a
really basic Wester maxi dress and it's
got this really cute little pocket I
thought we've really nice when you've
got like a bikini on are you coming back
on the beach it's just really nice and
relaxed and that was $9.99 and you guys
know I love my muted colors I also
bought this neon jumper as well from H&amp;amp;M
it's a fairly light material but it's
not as if it's kind of a chilly day but
you can still wear it on a day where
it's kind of warm because it's got like
short sleeves and they're really cute
and rolled up and I believe that was
that was $14.99 it's kind of washing out
the color because of the window but you
get the idea it's really nice if you
want to see a lot of these items I've
already worn make sure you check out my
blog which is moments or style.com out
there and then this jacket guys this
jacket has been given me life yeah it's
been giving me life just because and
it's like a really nice cute little
blazer I wear this to work almost every
day and if I'm wearing an all-black
outfit this just spruces it up from wear
with something really
just because it's striped and it's got a
pattern to it it just adds a bit more
pizzazz to it I'm not so if you saw
their like style video me and Sammy did
together but she actually picked me a
pair of trousers from H&amp;amp;M and I love the
Petraeus's she picked for me so much
they actually had to go out and buy them
I was like Sammy where did you get those
they're from H&amp;amp;M she's like this still
kind of new so I went in and I and I
found them a needs are gonna be great on
a holiday I think they're just a
gorgeous pair of trousers and the next I
wanted to show you was a little this
makeup case yeah you guys have any good
look and I'm just gonna talk about it
okay yeah it is really really heavy and
it was sent to me but I my it was gold
from my Marcus l.com I believe I now
have two of these in my room I love them
I think they're really really useful for
anyone who is asking about where I got
my storage boxes from I also went to the
river island I rarely go to river island
I'm so glad that I'm here because I've
been looking for a dream pair of denim
shorts like just a dream pair of denim
shorts and I find it really hard to find
often shorts are so short that there's
bum cheek on show or their bit too low
on the waist and I like high waist and
then I found these
I found these shorts that the perfect
color for me I love this color of denim
they're like kind of cutout rolled up
they're high-waisted they came with this
really like nice chunky belt which is
exactly how I wanted to wear I race the
denim shorts they've got these gorgeous
pockets at the back they're not too
tight not too short that absolutely
dream denim shorts dream and they were
actually 30 pounds which i think is a
lot but if they last forever because you
know if I'm away I would wear the same
pair of denim shorts just every day I'd
be really crusty and just wear them all
the time let's talk about my beloved
Zara's been looking after me in terms of
footwear these are just a holiday pair
these are just some sandals these are 22
pounds I believe and I just loved the
metallic um cuff on it right there I
love like metallic cuffs on shoes and
then I also bought these slingbacks now
I don't know why I - lien max you know
I'm asked to rethink this at some point
in time but I thought these are really
cute the heels really petite but it's
not - though it's not kidding you know
but it's not too high and there is some
amazing toe cleavage on these shoes that
you know that little line that Cleo
this shoe gives you the most amount of
toe cleavage I love it I love these
shoes and on the complete opposite of
the spectrum
I bought these as you can see they look
mammoth these chunky wedges as well
which are from Zara and I love the the
cut that weights come like a platform
chunky heel thing it's just got a lot
going on you guys have also seen this
jacket which I bought I bought four in
that video in the video that means Sammy
did and I kept her I love this jacket
like it's kind of got that grandma's
shape but I love grandma's shape that
especially if you're wearing things that
are quite sexy underneath I love this
shape of this jacket and it's got this
gorgeous quilting pattern I'm not sure
if you'll be able to see it and I have
worn it in a blog post before I love
this jacket it's kind of hi-low as well
and finally from Zara I picked up this
sheer top I love this top I absolutely
love this top I love the detailing that
is on the cuffs there hopefully you can
see that I actually love it so moving on
to a sauce and this dress this dress
gives me alive again I love this dress
it's just so cute I love the floral
pattern on it and I wore it in like an
Instagram post and it was a you know I
just took a picture of me trying it on
and it went to the popular pages so I'm
sure there's lots of people who always
think who also thought that this dress
is a really
cute dress and it's got tune and like
netting underneath if you want that kind
of girliness there it's just so girly I
can't wait to wear this okay and
sticking with another online store it's
misguided and misguided has become one
of my most favorite like stores to shop
online in terms of fast fashion and
things that are right on trend they are
all great and they were kind enough to
send me over just a few bits and I
picked a few items from the site so
firstly it was this floral dress and you
can't really see exactly how me on this
dress is but it is a neon orange and I
was like wow I thought it was gonna be
like some I don't know a thin material
or something this material is not a joke
it's like really thick and thick almost
like linen but not linen really good
material I also picked this monochrome
bodycon dress and it's got you know all
the right shapes in the right places and
it's this kind of cool pattern at the
front but it's black at the back and I
absolutely love that kind of monochrome
and look it's gorgeous
and again this high neckline has kind of
become a thing that I really like and I
must show you these look at these
glasses family is happen to me right in
front of Muffy and just can't describe
it I think these I picked them because
they look so unique I suspect you know
what I like having fun new my glasses
and Mike hasn't quite warmed to them yet
but you know this time there is time
finally I picked up another bikini you
guys know I've already got the beige one
of this I picked it up in the white
anyone who's asking in my thailand
videos where I got this bikini with the
tassels here it is I love it and because
I again I don't have very much in the
booby department but the tassels kind of
detract away from that so I absolutely
love this so guys that is my haul video
