video is going to be a haul video the
first part is going to be my eyes of
Stockholm Hall which is an association
with my shop with me ageless calm video
if you want to check that out you can
check out the link here so let's go
ahead and show you kind of the trends
and stuff that I'm currently buying and
so being this I've had this thing
recently where I just hate everything I
have that I want to just throw
everything away and start again
and I don't know if I'm the only one who
ever feels like that but I just say oh
just take all my clothes so just trynna
I'm trying to cleanse my palate you know
right put some lime lime lime sorbet
into my wardrobe and just start again
so the first trends that I'm kind of
into right now is the whole fetish trend
and I've always been a fan of leather
and black so I'm like you know you like
in the black you like liver go ahead and
purchase it so I'm also getting more and
more into shorts especially because I
know that you can combine them with
tights depending on what kind of shorts
you get and I bought these shorts here
from a source calm and the thing is
these were I do for they're overpriced
there's fifty pounds but they're all
right there like a felt material but I
do love the leather pocket detailing
there and the kind of tailored miss of
the shorts and it also has another 11
leg layer down there these are all
recent you could probably find them on a
sitcom so this item here is not really
part of the whole wardrobe cleansing
because it's like bright green and it's
very very very on trend in terms of
being an oversized clutch so I don't
know what I think but I do I do really
really like it so whether or not it's on
trend on or I just picked it up but it's
the kind of thing do I see myself
carrying this in a year from now or do I
think oh my god why the hell did I buy
that but for now I like it so then I
bought this piece that is definitely a
classic it's a tweed jacket is kind of
cropped which really suits my body shape
because I'm quite
p'tee and anything too long kind of
drowns me and anything to shoulders a
bit tacky I love the kind of tweed look
is very heritage and that's a trend that
is really big now but not because it's
just a trend I have always loved Browns
and tans and stuff and that's just me so
the fact that this is on trend is high
luxury for me and I love it because it's
got the suede pockets at the back as
well and I'm not going to talk about but
his dad like will love this this is so
Mike's dad that might kiss family so
okay I can wear this when we go on a
picnic or something finally from Asus
comm I picked up this leotard and it's
the kind of sweetheart neckline with the
kind of mesh on the top but this is a
bit different because it has the polka
dots on it this was 25 pounds the one
issue I do have is that for the
sweetheart neckline it does have go down
as much as I would like it to but it's a
great piece it's it's well made so as
calm as I've said ain't it so Topshop
has been amazing as of late and I picked
up loads and loads of this eBook they've
had this pail on and stuff like that so
first of all I bought this much top it's
in a navy blue and I don't really suit
blue but because it's mesh you get to
see my coloring as well so I think it
makes it actually is quite flattering to
me I love the fact that the detailing at
the bottom is you know really intend to
as the pop the top which is quite knit
and if it's cool just to a pair of
high-waisted shorts I'm into colored
jeans at the moment and not all college
eens I like the kind of movi colored
jeans
reminds of my school uniform and I
initially have these in the back star
but the backs are not as skinny so what
I ended up getting was it in the the Li
delay or the leo web they call it and
that's super skinny and super soft and
it's in this gorgeou code of movi dark
premier Reds but I'd like a really
garish red that is just so one season I
think you can wear this more than one
season winter summer I got this I got
this bargain in the sell these like
lime-green high-waisted tailored shorts
yeah yeah you jealous these aha and
they're in a size 6 and I said why are
they size 6 and why do they fit me but
they fit so well they're gorgeous like
really high waisted but they're not too
short or too tight and I just love the
tailoring on them they're fabulous and
even when I took it to the till then he
was like oh my gosh I just let a good
thing cut my some indeed I've decided
that you know the what amazing thing
about clothing and fashion is you don't
have to always buy something in your
size so those shorts are size 6 and I
just bought this jumper ok this jumpers
this size 14 but you can't really see
the detail but this jumper is amazing it
just straight gorgeously and sometimes I
do like buying beer bigger clothes just
for the drape just look at that is so
cute and knit I was really gonna be in
for the winter I'm already in autumn
mode anyway right everyone's still
wearing like bright colors I like bright
my woody jumpers in my punch folks but
that's what I'm like I'm like this is
lovely once again with the pair of
high-waisted trousers or high-waisted
jeans
just slouching over your shoulder I love
it so I'll show you the stuff - that's
not that much it's actually this top
here and it's in the sale again it was
$5.99 and I know it's just looks like a
plain t-shirt but I love it because it's
so soft it's I don't know if you can see
the detailing on it I hope you can but
um it's just cute because you can kind
of wear it off the shoulder if you want
to or you know really high neck or
really known it as well so it's one of
these kind of jumpers that are bigger
size again I love it and in whites like
whites my new thing as well you know
I've got so many new things and then I
bought this dress which you would have
seen me in already once again in the
sale it's the pleated skirt roar Oscar
gorgeous for work or for dinner and I
wore this to work and everyone was at
them and yeah and loved it
this is my color people brown once again
well not brown but you know this lovely
tan color and it's such a thick fabric
but it's been worn recently and I've
been able to wear it and not be too hot
and I've definitely be wearing this a
lot
the winter and finally I bought this
Roscoe and it was ten pounds in the cell
I love the black is high waisted and
this band that makes your stomach look
really thin and slim and then the kind
of the stripes as well in the kind of
browns and my kind of hues it's all
perfect for me oh I forgot to mention
the shoes I bought the slippers the
Hefner's that's what I'm calling them
the hips
I bought these from Topshop yes my feet
are massive you can see this but I love
this but anyone who's got big feet these
are made in such a way that it actually
decreases that's right it makes your
feet look smaller trust me I'm an expert
in that that's why I always wear heels
heels give you a higher arch which makes
your feet appear smaller you know I
can't wear triangle-shaped shoes because
they make my foot look like boats and
these are just wonderful for anyone who
has quite long ceiling fee and the thing
is I bought the plain black ones in the
suede but recently I saw the standard
ones I was like Janet
should I bought these loans from sure
would have got this ugly ones I'm
probably going to invest in another pair
of slippers anyway but I'm hoping to be
getting a colored pair as well but those
are these from Topshop 28 pounds quite
good so I guys at the end of my haul I
hope you enjoyed it bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
