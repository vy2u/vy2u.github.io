video is going to be a whole video but
before I get onto it I want you guys to
the I'm going to say hey - hey June I
checked out her channel this wall no
I've been subscribed to her for a while
actually but then I woke up this morning
yes I arise with my laptop like I open
my eyes and they're from my laptop I
became into YouTube and like I watched
like five or six other videos this
morning it was really really nice and
refreshing you know freshing and she's
got a few videos that are you know I
don't long you know 8 minutes 16 minutes
and nowadays we don't have much of an
attention span but I watched all of them
through beginning to end so when I watch
a video beginning to end it means I
really really like I'm someone and how I
was really cool God send her some love
you know and she's got great style and
she's got great hair beautiful so let me
get on with my hope so this is like a
mini haul cuz I I kind of just went out
recently and got a few bits so first of
all let me show you this gorgeous bag
that I picked up from the Zara now Zara
bags are usually very very expensive
they're really nice well not very very
so to know about 70 to 80 pounds and but
they usually very good quality leather
and you know whatever films are most of
stuff rooms aren't quite good quality
item but I thought this was really nice
because it's got obviously the sleeve so
you can make wear it over the shoulder
satchel but also you can take off those
and wear it is just a little arm pops
bag and that was only thirty pounds and
an edge of it was really nice and it
says Arabic kind of realized I can't be
ashamed to the fact that I like pink I
like pink
I like muted colors I like pastels they
suit me okay I can't get over that so
I'm not going to
shamed anymore not ashamed so I bought a
pink bellezza not a bright pink not like
a baby pink it's like a milky pink this
is not so garish Lee oh my god you're in
pink pink this is this pink long blazing
I like that you know the rolled up arms
and I love the fact that it was quite a
muted thing so that's that which I'm
going to throw over everything probably
gonna wear it out tonight
this is shirt that is also in a pink but
a very very muted pink and I love the
the black button going down the middle
and the detailing on the side and
obviously it's in my favorite which is
like chiffon and then the arms kind of
bag down like this as well so it's
really loose it's really free but still
quite girly and famous so finally I just
got a few pairs of shoes and from office
I don't go to office regularly why don't
I go to office regularly because their
stuff is to overprice seriously but
their cell staff is very good so I
bought a pair of shoes like this flat
dolly shoes W shoes maybe that's what we
used to glue them and you're back in the
day and they've got a bow on them and I
really like them and these actually
gonna be my work shoes or my runaround
shoes because I don't I don't really
wear flats that regularly but you know
there are times that you do need them
just throw them all over so you got
offset the flats with some killer heels
I saw these another must have and these
were so so the flat shoes were just 20
pounds or 21 pounds or something like
that and these were only 30 35 pounds I
think from 80 pounds and I loved it like
the bondage effect
these are very very more with the parent
like leggings or high-waisted trousers
this this guy's that is it got into my
whole I don't really get that much it's
not like a a major or massive haul but
it's a mini haul and I hope you enjoyed
watching bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
