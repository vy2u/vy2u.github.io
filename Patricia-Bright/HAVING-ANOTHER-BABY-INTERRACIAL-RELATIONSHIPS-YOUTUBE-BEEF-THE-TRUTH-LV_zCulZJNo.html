intervention relationship I'll be
genuinely honest with you I've never
felt like I was pretty be confidence the
first time you get naked with someone
near hello beautiful people welcome back
to my channel I hope you are doing well
today I'm excited as I always am because
you're about to get comfortable and sit
down and have a chitchat it has been a
hot minute since I just sat down and
have a talk with you
and I'll see you guys on my Twitter my
Instagram or snapchat to send me your
questions and I did the hashtag oz PB so
I wanted all your questions and we're
just gonna answer them right here right
now this one is gonna be a long one so
just accept it if you like long videos
then you know get comfortable get
yourself a cup of tea listen I have a
tea right here you guys know the teas
they kind of left the YouTube they never
left my life like I drink a English
breakfast tea like every single day so
you guys like ask me a ton of questions
on snapchat on Twitter and from
relationship advice to who do you
believe on the Internet - what's my
favorite foundation and yeah there's
some awkward questions in there but I
don't mind no we try to keep it very raw
on this channel yeah so let's get into
it so what do you do with the clothes
from the large halls I don't know if you
like me but when I shop online if it
looks good on the model I'm like put it
in the basket put it in the basket I'm
like a crazy person and I've seen my
boss give you like 1,000 items a 1,000
puzzle I heard I don't have 1,000 that
pounds to spend on clothing oh yeah I
often take a lot of stuff out my basket
but when I do my videos and basically
buying everything right and then we're
trying it on and we're seeing if it's
any good a lot of the items if they're
crap on me I'll just do refunds as
simple as that
how many times do you buy 15 items from
a source and you only keep one of them I
think it happens so almost every single
girl it looks great on the model but you
know like a toenail when you're wearing
it so why would I keep an item when I
look like crap right how do you deal
with keeping up with the latest fashion
trends and by the way I really love you
you make me and my whole family laugh
love you too darling
like what's a fashion trend I don't even
even fashion trends I believe in
clothing that you wear that makes you
feel good and you look good when you
wear it and you kind of and it fits your
body well that's really really important
to me because I mean right now I've got
the shiny shining shining shining
shining and we put the shiny like latex
what these called trousers or I have
these these are from Topshop and they
are a trend item but I saw them out
there kind of shiny they kind of make
fire so I bought them because I felt
like I could connect to it rather than
me feeling like I'm buying items to
trends but I like to feel good when I
wear them like I like to feel like yes
I'm frightened I look good you know
that's a goal ignored friends what's the
trend like and I'm not I'm not that fast
okay this is a question I got ups a lot
grace in the QT do you plan on having
any more children but one of those
you're like you look pregnant you're
glowing I'm not now I'm not pregnant
darling has a new foundation and I've
been eating a lot of cake so yeah I put
on a couple of pounds and I'm not
pregnant and do I plan on having any
more kids yes I would love to have
another three now that's nice I love to
have two and I wouldn't mind having
three what are my thoughts on getting
married young if you are comfortable and
confident and mature I know that the
person is right for you I don't see
anything wrong with it but you need to
be mature the person ISA mature be
mature and you need to not be rushing
into a marriage just because you want to
be married I got married when I was like
23 24 I was engaged when I was 23 and I
knew that I needed to get married
married early because one we'd been
together for like five years already and
two I'm crazy so I was like that I need
to be settled down let's settle down so
I can get on with life that was
something that was really at what I knew
that whoever I'm gonna be with we're
gonna grow together and so that was you
know I knew that I was gonna be that
kind of person well this is the skincare
question I'm gonna do skincare video
that might actually be in my next video
but this one is a good one
it's chemical exfoliation better than
physical exfoliation and because it's
important to exfoliate
personally I'm a chemical queen I live
for my acids hyaluronic acid eh-eh-eh-eh
it's vitamin C but I I love acids and I
love chemicals and I love anything
that's got to do the science about
actually changing the way your skin
works and improving it now I know a lot
of people like physical scrubs but I
find them personally a bit too you know
dangerous on my face and I react badly
to those this is one of the biggest
questions throughout my whole youtube
life that I've been asked about and I
always avoided the topic and it's to do
with interracial relationships and I've
got I'm not gonna lie it kind of makes
me cringe like and you know this is
probably why I haven't ever broach this
topic before but here let speak on it
let's speak on interracial relationship
so I happen to be an interracial
relationship
my husband is Caucasian he is white I
have not always opted to be in
interracial relationships however I feel
like I've dated I've always been very
fluid with the kind of guys I've dated
so my first crush was Filipino my second
crush was some Italian guy that I met in
Italy while I was a kid and my third
crush was a strong guy me in and at uni
I dated like Geryon guys and black guys
and I date mixed-race guys and then I
settled with a white guy so I feel like
I've always been someone who's been open
to all kinds of races of men and I like
who likes me I'm not I'm not I'm the
kind of girl that if the guy is
attracted because I see attractiveness
in all different all different kinds of
people if he's attractive and he finds
me attractive I'm here I'm not going to
beg someone who doesn't find me
attractive to find me attractive by feel
not interested I'm not here for it
but if you're interested and I think
you're good-looking you have that
attraction to me I am I'm here for it
and I did I don't actively or I didn't
actively search out a white sky to UM
date with pride to date and micro is
dating Nigerian guys black guys prior to
that was a Ghanian guys I'd gone down my
African brother
I had gone
that route but then I ended up meeting
and connecting with Michael and then we
do up getting married I feel like I'm
finally getting this off my chest so how
have other people reacted to me being in
an interracial relationship and never
had any problems with being in an
interracial relationship or whatever
being a thing until I came on YouTube so
I realized that it was a thing to people
because of people in the Internet and I
think it's because you have people who
come from all over the world who are not
used to seeing certain things so the
fact that I feel like me and Mike have
quite had quite similar upbringings
being that we are in our city kids
similar demographic in terms of parents
wealth status in terms of the schooling
that we went through in terms of some of
our experiences here's a slightly
different because he's from up north in
Manchester - slightly different because
I'm a London I'm a South London half not
really looked at our side ways it wasn't
a thing even in London London such a
multicultural City that nobody cares but
on the internet people seem to make a
thing out of it and I and I think it's
because of a lot of people come from
maybe areas where there was a bit more
racial tension and it's it's weird but
it wasn't weird another question I
always get is what did your parents
think my parents are cool as long as you
have respect
so Michael need the words very early
your frettin moment was auntie and uncle
that's it auntie uncle we did a lot to
try and help out he was very respectful
my family and that's all that matters
you know and I think maybe have they're
very sick we have the same belief system
and we have the same foundation and that
is why I feel like we could connect how
would I deal with people looking at me
nobody I don't feel like anybody looks
at me and if they're looking at me let
them look look that is some popcorn
let's share it together and not that
fast if people stare at me so yeah that
is of my thoughts and interracial
relationships what is the best and worst
thing about YouTube and the best thing
is honestly um you guys it sounds really
cliche but it genuinely is I read
everything
comment in the middle of the night I'm
just packing into myself reading what
you love right I'm like just sitting in
my bed with the light beaming at me just
cackling away and then also the thing I
always say this I'd love to create so
the ability to come up with an idea
write it down it's a really good
I find it like therapy I might again I
did I've done this or a hobby for so
long and then obviously it's not a job
but it feels really good to just come
here and be like a little really they're
like talk and if you don't like my
talking you can just skip or switch off
until you do something else the worst
thing about YouTube is it's the scrutiny
and I think it's the people criticizing
you about about every move you make I'm
a confrontational person as in let's
have a discussion like I will get you
into a room and let's talk and because
my side of the story has to be you have
to understand whereas you I don't get
the opportunity to do that I can't
defend myself there's no way to defend
yourself work against people who want to
believe a certain thing about you so
it's almost like you have to be in a
position where you're like well I'm just
gonna not say anything you have to
humble yourself and accept that not
everybody likes you and yeah they're
gonna say crap and they're gonna make up
stuff and you're just gonna have to be
like okay well here we are
how do you find life in the limelight
and do you ever get days where you just
want to shut it down I will honestly say
I don't I'm not in the limelight all the
time I mean I'm moving home the
limelight when I'm filming videos cuz in
reality I'm in my bedroom you know I
mean I'm in a room I'm in my house I got
my tea I'm chilled I feel relaxed so I
only feel like I'm in the nine-nine say
like on Twitter when because whenever
you speak that's it's like a public
forum and then like maybe when I go out
very very rarely like I do get stopped
all the time but it's only for a split
second so it's like oh hi I took a
picture and they were all gone I do find
just for having to be careful about what
I say difficult because I'm a human
being and I'm emotional and I feel like
sometimes people want you to be a
certain way and if you're not that way
they're like why do not like this you
should be like this and I might know
so it's a little bit difficult in that
sense but I shut down all the time I do
social media trends is all the time to
be this when I get home my phone is
thrown on the side I don't see my phone
yeah I'm chilling on the sofa and I'm
chilled all the way out this is quite a
specific question but what advice would
you give an individual who wants to
start a podcast that helps people
suffering with mental health but they're
scared of the results not being
successful and their self doubts that
they might not be the right individual
to take on this challenge
okay I mean if you want to start a
podcast or a YouTube channel I got a lot
of questions like this so what's my
advice right I think everybody is
looking at numbers right now stop
looking at numbers and focus on creating
something good for yourself right when I
first started YouTube my first video you
had one of you I was like well it's got
one view had two views three of these
and fourth years at five years five
years 67 views I didn't realize that it
was my views cuz I was the one who was
kicking on and clicking off and checking
every single time I checked it was going
up it was me who was watching my own
video okay fail I don't know even know
right I didn't know I was watching my
own videos and I was adding my views but
I enjoyed my own videos yes the start of
would be creating something that you're
confident that you know about that you
want to share you just wanna have some
fun it doesn't have to be serious if
you're just enjoying yourself enjoy
whatever comes will come if you have a
specific strategy my opinion is look at
what's trending and emulate what's
trending if there are people that you
like other than is anything wrong with
taking an idea and developing it do what
you do in your own way simple as that
do you have a favorite lotion for your
body yes I think I said this in my last
video it is the body shot body butters I
used to coconut one and then because I'm
so dry I like to top that off with a
body oil so like Palmer's they have this
coconut body oil I don't do all the time
but if I'm going out and my legs need to
be shiny I'll top it up with the body
oil so how do I jungle adult
responsibilities I don't drug on it I
don't get a lot of sleep I love I love
my diary I love my Excel I love
notebooks and I write everything down
every dream every vision every idea
every video I did every thing I've got
to do personally in terms of braid braid
Grace's hair Monday night because I wash
your hair on Sunday do the food shop
because you got to do the meal prep on
the Sunday because you're not even able
to cook in a week you have this meeting
on this day you gotta shoot this by this
day so I'm someone who I have a diary
for everything I've got an excel here
which has got all my video ideas in it
I've got my calendar for all my meetings
and all that kind of stuff so balancing
it is about being organized if you've
got it all in your head the likelihood
of you being able to actually deliver is
knit is ridiculous like you I don't I
didn't I don't sleep at night when my
head is buzzing buzzing so I wake up and
I write stuff with my notepad right I've
done my notepad and I'm good to go
if I ever feel like I want to go back to
a certain age if say what age and wine
so I hated secondary school I really
didn't have a good time at secondary
school now I look back on it I was
bullied quite a lot but I didn't really
care
wasn't hurt by being bullied I just
accepted it as part of my life
University was again I'd wasn't great I
think those around 21 21 22 23 I had
once I was on my internship at an
amazing time I made some amazing friends
partied so hard but that was a really
good period of time but to bonus now I
feel like I'm living my best life like
literally do I find it challenging
having motherhood and having a career
not now it was challenging earlier on I
think it
took me quite a while to really set into
the swing of things and I think I have
an aspect of postpartum depression which
I think a lot of people have but they
don't really know that they have and it
really took me about four to six months
to really be to really get back to being
me when I look back I realized wow I
really wasn't me
in those early stages I was a lot more
down and I could tell that there was a
hormonal difference it was almost like a
light switch in the difference of how I
was but around the five five six months
stage and we had I had a baby set up
meaning that I would take her so I'd go
to my meetings I'd go do jobs because
I'm a working mom at the end of the day
and so was my husband and then now my
little ones in nursery now she's there
four days a week and she's going to go
into preschool so this is really good I
mean I'm all about education and I've
seen her development like lychee leaps
and bounds and I think I think she's
developed for her okay how many days of
the week do you work out I mean at the
moment it's like one to two I'm trying
but a hunk I'm try and try again but
food it's so good and then I get so
tired I need to I genuinely need to work
out more the my goal is so I cut more
than one company working out like
seriously when do we as people someone
don't have body positivity okay
I'll be genuinely honest with you I've
never felt like I was pretty I even till
now I'm like no six yeah and I feel like
I kind of get to got to this place of I
accepted that I didn't think that was
pretty so and I did this video before
called the ugly friends right so I
didn't I do not I do not hold much
esteem or much power in my physical
appearance okay isn't the most important
thing to me I'd rather be funny
I'd rather be loving I'd rather be with
you I'd rather be smart I rather be err
be elegant I'd rather be a nice person
than P it'd be beautiful if you're like
it it's just a case of accepting and
then you know developing other areas if
you want to be a bit more body positive
and just liking those things about you
but feel like that's a bit of a cop-out
I'm not gonna sit everything I like
my belly and I don't like it it looks
dusty but is there and you know I'm
alive and well I've got a family I'm not
gonna I'm not gonna I'm not gonna die
over it so yeah how do you do with body
confidence the first time you get naked
with someone year especially when you
really like them I mean my opinion is
turn the lights off haha but it is dark
you can't see everything you can feel
and it always feels good so that's why I
just turn the lights off and then
you know eventually you get more
comfortable you get more confident you
just like lay or hang out do i watch
YouTube and if so who is my favorite
youtuber yes I do what I live and I
watch a lot of YouTube funnily enough I
don't watch that many like beauty videos
or fashion videos my favorite youtubers
I hate free hate free love ela and Ethan
I think they're actually hilarious
hilarious I die and then I watch a lot
of what's this guy called he doesn't
like news is his name he's been around
for ages but I've only just like
watching it I like put his name right
here I don't watch a lot of videos
within this space it's crazy but I like
watching comedy videos and new chant new
news videos because they allow me to
just get out of my everyday norm if I
could describe my my style in one word
we've had this discussion is bougie
thought we've had this discussion I made
up the word it's my own word and that's
my style where do I see myself in five
years I see myself building brands now
that's the number one thing that I want
to do and I'm working on I've got a lot
of stuff coming forward and I want to
employ people I think I've said this to
your hunt like many times before that I
just want to give people jobs I want
them to be able to work in the
environment that feels fun and relaxed
and enjoyable but creative and
disciplined and focus and was just color
and vibrance you know that's really
important to me because I feel like when
I was working it just felt so black and
white and I felt like I wanted vibrance
in an environment and I want to make
sure that I can do that for people as
well hi Patricia how long did it take
you to reach 1,000
Viper's I think it took me at least a
year to reach 1,000 subscribers at least
a year and two years to get to 10,000
subscribers I remember I've got a video
on video where I was like thank you for
my 10,000 subscribers I just wanted to
say thank you to all my subscribers I've
now got over a hundred subscribers I
just don't have the time to make a video
and during the week I'm really really
happy so this is going to be more or
less because I reached my hundred videos
my last idea was my Huntress video which
I'm really excited about and also I want
to get to 10,000 subscribers now I'm
almost on 7,000 and it is a feat like
really big aim to get to 10,000 but
before you know 2011 I'd really like to
do that and yeah that was like a year
and a half to two years into the first
starting on YouTube and then kind of
just went crazy from there this is a
good question are there any other
youtubers that I don't go on with like a
lot of people ask me if I've got beef
with other youtubers I do not have beef
with any other youtubers I will say that
I'm not like I'm not best friends with
most of them the person that encloses
two on YouTube out of YouTube is Shirley
and an array me and we've gone on
holiday with each other and their other
gods that I've met who are so nice that
they're very nice but personalities I'm
a lot for some people 90% 95% of the
people I've met all the on YouTube are
exactly as they are on YouTube in the
real life I don't think anyone's fake I
hate when people say that they're so
fake what does that mean what does that
mean this is their fake I just think
that people are who they are and some
people get on with each other and some
people are gonna be best friends and
some people are going to be
acquaintances I think that's a really
really normal but you're sure are you
planning on staying in the UK are you
gonna um end your days in another
country well Indian days is some big
talk but I plan on spending half of my
time here and half of my time in LA so
I'm looking at making moves to go
stateside do I ever feel like I have to
compromise myself the more successful
I'd get in order to maintain
success and I do not feel like I have to
compromise myself because I'm not a
compromising person I'm a rebel so if
I'm out to do something one way or I
have to be a certain way I usually go
the other way because I'm not going to
do that I think the best thing in in in
this kind of industry as a youtuber and
in life is to be really really firm in
who you are be really really
strong-willed and I think whoever likes
you will like you and it doesn't like
you won't so they can piss off what's
your favorite quote and why it's feel
the fear and do it anyway I think that
that has really helped me achieve a lot
of success in life I am NOT the most
confident person but what I am is a
fearless person I just do stuff and I
hope for the best and a lot of the time
it actually worked so for the feeling do
it anyway the worst most embarrassing
moment as a mother I mean I would say I
mean I've had a lot of like when I was
breastfeeding I had a lot of breast
leakages it's a bit like know like I'll
be in a taxi and when you had the but I
had a breast pump and I'd be sitting in
the back of the taxi and I'd be going
burnt black man
I like milking myself like in the middle
of a taxi and I I had actually had
opportunity to come on BBC Radio and I'm
like you know I just had a baby it
wasn't too long and then I cut me in
it's fine so I was milking in the taxi
right had a very much a bit of a milk
spill and then when I arrived at BBC I
had these two bottles of breast milk I
was like do you have a fridge I need to
put my breast milk in the fridge and it
was just like really it's not
embarrassing this mother would you have
to kind of you grind you'd be a mum like
my baby need you to have breast milk got
to save it for later on my partners if I
could wear one brand for the less rest
of my life what would it be it would
actually be a dose because eggs isn't
even a brand but it means I can try lots
of different brands all the time and if
it comes to like facial products it's a
really hard one would be poppy L'Oreal
Paris genuinely because the foundation
is great the concealer is great and it's
affordable so if I go broke a second
afford oil pair
where would I say my inspiration in life
comes from like my attitude to
everything my inspiration genuinely
comes from my mom my mom is a go-getter
my mom doesn't believe that anything can
go wrong she's slightly delusional but
the delusion has got her far so she's
very much like it's fine
it will work out I'll sure just try
anything and she'll see how it goes and
should be very firm that that thing will
work out for her that she doesn't she
doesn't have a negative thoughts towards
herself or towards her situation she
could be sitting in a ditch and she'll
be like it's amazing this ditch is
amazing like my situation is amazing if
the might sound crazy but having that
attitude and that no fear is something
that I want to have more on because and
also being able to see what you see
around you in a pinup in the right way
and also I was taught life and death is
in the power of the tongue so speak life
is it's a but as the bible scripture and
i believe that you speak that speak
those things that are not as there they
are so and that's the attitude that my
mom is and I remember one time as it
cleared where I said to myself I think I
was I was having a strop and I said oh
I'm so stupid or I'm so I'm such an
idiot
oh I said oh I said something bad about
myself right my mom slapped me she's
like never you said that about yourself
so as a kid my mom would never call me a
bad kid she'd be like I'm strong-willed
so that kind of positivity around myself
and my lifestyle and seeing that I feel
like has helped me I have flaws but I
don't focus on them you know I focus on
what can be what what's great about me
and what I can achieve and I would
employ I pull anyone out there see the
things that are great about yourself and
be like yes look at me I'm fly tell my
sauce that okay guys I think that is me
done I don't know how long this video is
about to be it's a Q&amp;amp;A
like it was time to have a chat it's
