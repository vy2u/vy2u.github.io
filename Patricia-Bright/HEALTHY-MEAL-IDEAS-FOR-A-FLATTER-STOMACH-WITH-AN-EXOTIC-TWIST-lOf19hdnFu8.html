hey guys so today we've got a video
that's a little bit different for you
guys I wanted to do kind of like a
foodie kind of video don't we have it
ever done like Papa foodie video like
this before but I'm having to get
serious about my health and fitness
routine you gotta at the beginning of
the year I was on it and I don't know I
just dropped off so hard and I like to
be honest with you we are all human and
sometimes you know it's hard to keep it
up and I'm really really dropped off
like I was just eating what I wanted to
and I kind of developed a bit of a sugar
addiction like I'd have a bit of
chocolate everyday I'm still kinda
having a chocolate if you don't even lie
I'd have I could cross on each day and I
just build up all these really bad
eating habits and you don't realize that
when you're doing it you're just kind of
adding more sugar and carbohydrate into
your diet which is going to kind of make
you feel more lethargic and obviously
it's not gonna make you look that good
when you're doing that so I really
wanted to take a grip on what I was
eating and how I'm eating it so I wanted
to do this video and share with you some
kind of healthy breakfast lunch and
dinner ideas and that I like and I have
it's got a bit of an exotic twist and
it's not everyday salad nko like I like
to have plantain and I like to have yams
and I like to have okra and I like to
have really good healthy stuff that is
exotic so yeah so guys I hope you
enjoyed this video so as they say abs
are made in the kitchen I definitely
don't have abs yet but I have been
working on changing my diet just to give
me a flatter stomach and to make me feel
better
and breakfast is the first part of the
day so I'd like to start off with some
fruit because I am still a sugar Fein
and working on it
but through is really good for you so
I'm going with some strawberries and
blueberries just because I like them and
they make my porridge taste extra sweet
so I just give them a wash and it
chopped them up nicely
now my favorite kind of oats are
basically still caught oats and they're
so cheap to buy and so easy to make I
basically put a good portion inside a
bowl I boil a kettle because I like to
do it in the bowl and I just go probably
just over the top of it give it a stir
and I put it in the microwave and it
really cooks in about a minute and a
half you just have to watch it because
sometimes it can bubble over but it's
super quick and easy in the meantime I'd
go ahead and just cut all my fruit just
to go inside my bowl now as mentioned I
don't really add any sugar or anything
to my porridge I've got used to eating
it quite explain me but if I want to add
something sweet or add Algarve let tart
which is a natural sweetener which is
quite good and how I like my porridge is
with a splash of milk and water and the
fruit on top but that is a quick and
easy healthy breakfast idea by moving on
to lunch with a bit of an exotic twist
is planting and scrambled eggs this is
one of my favorite and some of you
probably know what planting is but some
people don't it's basically the cousin
of a banana but it's a little bit more
starchy and more thinning and I just cut
off the skin which I like mine to be
medium right I don't like like the green
plantain but I like them when they're a
bit hard and not too sugary because they
can get quite sweet when they're very
ripe and I chop these up at an angle and
then I make a set of scrambled eggs
basically and this is not just for me so
that's why I've got four eggs but
usually I'd have two or one and a half
of myself and I chopped in some spring
onions and some onions some tomatoes and
add some salt and pepper and maybe some
seasoning and it's just a lovely way to
make eggs taste a little bit more sexy
so no one wants to eat too much oil of
course but I add probably about two to
three tablespoons and one tablespoon of
vegetable oil is usually about a 90
calories I know what I'm doing with it
and I just cover the pan and I just fry
these it can be grilled but I just think
they look a lot nicer when they are
fries because you get a nice brownie
over all of them and touching the
outside and just highlight them in the
meantime for my scrambled eggs
I just whisk them up nicely and they'll
go into a pan now parting only takes
about 10 to 15 minutes before they brown
very nicely on one side and then I flip
them over there's no risk of eating
planting or anything like that so for me
it's all about getting the perfect color
after that I put all my onions and my
tomatoes and any other seasoning
I could have garlic and ginger sometimes
if I want to but I don't really do that
they add those into a pan and let them
cook a little bit so after their
vegetables are cooked I will go ahead
and add in my scrambled eggs as normal
and this is like a weird version of an
omelet basically and I just whisk it up
and it cooks from the bottom around the
tops I need to kind of stay on top of it
so I don't have you know weird cooked
bits and non cooked bits of egg which
isn't very tasty so usually we're
planting is finished by the time we're
XR done I usually like to lay them on a
napkin to get rid of any excess oil or
anything and these are just how I like
them a little bit brown and a little bit
firm with my scrambled eggs on the side
this is a really nice dish I just add
some salt and some pepper and I'm good
to go
so here comes dinner and it's black eye
peas and sea bream
I don't mind heavier dinners as long as
they're healthy black eye beans are one
of my favorite kinds of beans they take
quite a while to cook but they're
absolutely delicious they've got such a
nice natural taste and they're so good
for you so I give them a wash and drain
them out they don't really need a wash
but I can boil a kettle again a kettle
so handy for me I add some salt and some
seasoning to my beans and then I pour in
the water they take a really long time
to cook over an hour because they are
quite firm but you can just put a lid on
it and let it do what it does and you
don't have to watch it maybe add a
little bit of water here and there so in
the meantime it gives me time to prepare
my fish I'm not squeamish at all I can
gut the head and descale my fish all by
myself
and I go ahead and season with some fish
seasoning some salt some pepper and some
herbs that would just make it taste
extra nice and then I pop that into the
oven
I always see need some vegetables and I
love courgettes and carrots and sugar
snap peas so I'll just chop these up and
they will go on the grill in the last
five minutes so as you can see my peas
do change color once they get cooked
they get a lot softer and a bit more
squidgy and then I add a stew or a sauce
that I made earlier I'll show you one
day how I make my stews but um it just
adds so much flavor and depth to it and
I wasn't sure of my ratio so I did it
bit by bit
I left list for another five to ten
minutes just to cook off as well so I
had to replace my old school George
Foreman it did me so well but I got this
new one which is from cuisine art and it
really does just do a really good jobs
on vegetables and paninis I love this so
I add my sugar snap peas and my
courgette and my carrots nice and simply
and then it literally needs about five
minutes to grill on there and it gets
gives you some nice Brown lines which I
always love
so basically after that it's all done
and all I need to do is dish up my beans
on the side with my veggies and I go
ahead and add my grilled fish which
looks extra tasty to me so that is
basically how I make some healthy meals
to help with a flatter stomach and just
to get back on the ball so neither hope
you enjoyed that video and it gave you
some healthy lunch and dinner ideas and
if you ever do do them please let me
know and send me pictures and Instagram
and all that good stuff but in the
meantime I'll catch you in my next video
thanks for watching guys bye
