phenomenal guy walk past me smelliness
I'd be like putty in his hand well hello
beautiful people welcome to my channel
as you can see I'm surrounded by
unmounting RPL baggages I'm sweating if
it's so hot it's just so hot this so
much stuff it and today I'm going to do
a PR unboxing so I want to show you what
I've got here today and I want with them
I'm so grateful for all the stuff I
receive is an odd combo this is their
penis together darlings this is going to
go like a cup of tea let's get
comfortable and let's see what we got
here if you haven't watched one of these
videos before basically as someone who
does YouTube videos we get sent a lot of
items I and it is a real privilege to
receive a lot of these items often what
it is is that brands will send you stars
I mean you're not paid it's not
sponsored but have we like that people
want to know what's pop it and they want
to know what car so I'm going to try and
show you what I has more regularly this
is over like the last two or three
months since the last time I done an
unboxing so yeah let's just get straight
into it okay so we have this huge box
here let's see what since it is from NYX
I feel like Nick's a very generous they
do send me separately a lot of the time
it says getting ready to strengthen your
brow game so it's like this month is
betting here a lot of rare products in
it I've never used any brow products
from Nick there's a ton of brow pencils
here this is a micro brow pencil crayon
and then this I think is just a pencil
and these are like Browns and colors I
would never normally pick hearts so if I
can ash brown there's a brunette there's
an espresso and there's a black I mean
if you're still wearing black brows in
2017 the struggle is very real for you
wear a black brows shout out to you nice
that is the expresso
an expresso isn't as dark as I thought
it would be that's expressed though of
the honest of you it feels a little bit
dry I really like a like it has to be
creamy like I like a creamy eyebrow
pencil I was I feel like my brother's
disappearing on the pencil but let's try
this like wow ash Franz really does look
ashy on me and literally that's like
gray on me to the other one it's an
expresso ooh
expresso there nice that is my kind of
Express oh this is more prominent look
at this Nick these cases are like
absolutely edgy look at this hey Patrick
I've met Patrick I know him and he's
really nice basically inside are all of
these total control drop foundations and
there is every shade here I think there
are 30 shades it says it says find your
map also come with the little glorious
finish blending sponge and brush okay
let me pick one I think might be my
shade let's do that but check these are
they do look quite similar don't like I
feel like I could easily wear all three
of these but then look at this I love
the fact they've got all of the spectrum
I check out how white these are so truth
is how why is that that is so cool when
the same dress like how cool is this
love it okay let me let me try let me
swatch okay oh look at that that is
beautiful oh yes oh wow and it is full
coverage you know has just covered that
up in an instant
Wow and that color is the Norman all I
was thinking it was a bit small but the
way that this is full coverage I feel
like it could easily easily like do your
whole face and last the world and very
excited there's so many different colors
in which all should come out as keen
come in okay can I see Alice has my
benchmark for the lighter skin what
shade you think you are like that shade
she's actually quite she's that cocktail
this was a part
the plan but thing is really right this
shape here is light over it she's not
gonna forget anything again no this is
no you're not used to Vicky cut no
Eileen oh but no that's not for you my
friend
no think I could kind of etch Alice
better than she could color match
herself I knew it I knew that hold on
look see yes well I'll see I color much
better and I'm is kind of much myself
girl looking a bit beige oh I didn't
know that the right go struggle is also
real oh I've hidden that shade was quite
nice in here let me try one that's much
you don't put that one look we mix
together not exactly that one it for you
isn't it yeah how cool is that well
Thank You Alice thank you for your hand

Norden or okay so I put it under water

you can see like a soapy texture but
it's not beads actual definitely not be
and it's a larger ring up nicely

nice I don't think a lot of people talk
about their brushes but if I'm looking
for a brush I will always draw for my

record so whenever they give me a brush
in like a pack on my yeah even if I

nourishing brow oil
Wow corrector it's like in a razor I can
a razor but under your brows it's got
like a liquid or something in it okay

nourish and keep your browser looking
good things glossy with our innovative

of talent okay
BH Cosmetics are used to bribe speech
cosmetics back here back in the early
you tuesdays and i was like obsessed
with like finding new palettes like on
ebay and amazon they've come a long way
that's like highlight six color palette
sculpt and glow that looks Donnie V hate
Studio Pro ultimate brow palette back in
the day they just used to do eyeshadows
cream contour palette for your eyes 28 i
shadow colors lavish elegant 15 teeth
brush set and a highlight limit actually
do a little swatch so you guys can see i
love watching people do this they're
very very creamy I'm surprised okay nice
and supple look at the brush is because
I know people love to find a good brush
deal so I don't know what these cost so
often when I get stuck into what PR they
don't necessarily show what the price is
but it comes with this case they are
quite soft little bit alright alright
they're not like a tart brush but they
seem okay they're all fluffy brushes
those what they're missing is that goes
around like flat brush in here and they
seem quite similar but in different
sizes so I so don't feel like this could
be your essential brush set but there's
some good brushes in here but not an
essential set this is vibrant and
missing my reds and oranges though I
love reds and oranges if I don't see
resin oranges in a palette I'm not happy
I'm impressed I'm impressed maybe
because I just have been out of the loop
for a while but I don't remember them
being amazing but all I know they
stepped up their grades
oh nice how does a brow sculpting pillow
contour and highlight and blush palette
it better be cute this is not for me
this is not this I will be contouring
with this whether the cream contour
palette is looking amazing the dark one
is just about dark enough for me to
contour with that's the dark one this is
the one in the middle it's super creamy
and I'm sure I could highlight with that
color there by Clinique they're very
generous mice Moisture Surge you don't
know about Moisture Surge get to know I
think I use it in my blog that's coming
up so I will be definitely mentioning it
really really good moisture without the
oiliness all skin needs moisture chubby
plump and shine all pets are so crazy I
recognize the the product by the color
and the branding so this is like their
vitamin C range which is really really
good watch this and I'm getting a good
time I'll go but look so all of this so
thank you for me if there's another
block pick it's got to WT they know I
love the lashes these are all huda
beauty lashes the Giselle Lodge is my
favorite quite like the Samantha as well
I'm actually wearing the Samantha lashes
today funny enough this is my own pair
that I bought but I've got some fresh
ones Samantha harmony looks quite
special I feel like I'd wear a harmony
then this boxes with a beauty all new
this is her 3d highlighter palette again
I've heard about it full Zanzibar
gorgeous so Zanzibar looks like it's
really pink but it isn't more like a
warm I love that stunning yeah
and then I have this feel like I should
know what's in here but I actually don't
if you look I've seen ISM some people
snap my gosh a that phenomenal i'm
swatching mystical and funny enough it
was the first kind of that appealed to
me that is beautiful
the issue is how wearable are they like
how regularly are you going to go out

honest in this day and age I feel like
everyone wears holographic lips so you
can definitely do it if you want to so

this little bear from Tom for private
blended minerals so I think that might
be inside here I've never heard of that
