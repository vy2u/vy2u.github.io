hello lovely people today I look a bit
crazy because we've got the eyes done
and not the face for today I'm doing a
full coverage high-end highlight and
contour routine because I so much it's
about time I've done one of these and I
feel like I've learnt so much when it
comes to beating my own face and makeup
that you know what let me talk it
through and share with you what I've
learnt what I like to do and hopefully
some you guys may find it useful so
let's get straight into this okay so
let's get into the foundation
I actually message of my friend Esther
makeup artist always makes me look the
mayor what foundation is she always use
on me and she uses the all day luminous
weightless foundation and I'm not going
to lie like when I first use it effect
why is it so liquidy so bit watery
however the finish is always flawless on
me so you know what I trust her the
color is really saturated and that Brown
which I really like and one of the key
trips obviously is to press foundation
into your skin okay well I am luminous
okay so fully covered but you see that
my face is lacking all kinds of
dimension so I'm going to go ahead with
the new knob soft matte complete
concealer if you don't know about this
you should get to know I've seen so many
people talking about it and it's a full
coverage concealer which has a kind of
mattifying effect and kind of gives you
a blur without feeling cakey and I use
this so much on my everyday makeup I
really really like this
my only main quite with it is the fact
that it's in a pot but I understand why
because it's quite a thick formula and
so trying to squeeze that out is going
to be ridiculous I always wash my hands
put on the back of my hand and go in
with my fingers because once you warm
this up like it's literally life like
really life I'm just going to go in with
my fingers and I also like to go in
slightly at the side of my nose as kind
of part of the highlights and contour
routine
it just takes everything in a bit and
also as my face is white like kind of a
little pie head I do not take the
concealer all the way out there cuz it
just makes it look broader so I bring it
down versus wide so the shade I'm using
in the soft matte complete concealer is
a Monday I've kind of gone away from
going ridiculously bright when it comes
to highlighter because that's just not a
good look
well good luck man somedays looks human
I'm just going to highlight the bridge
of my nose or just this flat brush and
some people do they're like kind of star
thing here but I've got a wide forehead
and it just makes it look wider
so I've actually stopped doing that the
thing is this not everything that you
see on the internet that actually suits
you so it's really important to just
look at yourself
test and try it and then work out what
actually genuinely works for you okay
and then what I like to do is kind of
let it sit for a minute I don't know why
I just feel like when you start like
blending it away you're just blending
all the product off just let it sit for
a little bit more every day remove it
you pay good money for it
so next I go in with my powder I do
baked kind of but not excessively I'm
going in with the Sascha powder because
it's my favorite one it's like I've got
loads on doesn't it but I don't feel
like I do I like to also get my creases
here because they like to do a creasing
throughout the day like no and then let
that sit for a minute before I kind of
brush it all off all right so now I'm
going to go in with my contour I do like
using a powder contour this is the bear
Pro from bare minerals and the color I'm
using is kokoa I'm going to go a bit
darker just say that you guys can see
everything and then I'm going to go in
with the same powder and I'm going to
just contour I like to focus on my chin
area because that's where I'm having a
bit of excess excess chin for highlight
and going in with the new uh Nastasia
palette I'm going to go in with globe
let-up pepper because this color I know
looks good on me honestly that really
does have a really nice like Sunbeam
glow oh my gosh I love that okay guys I
ever completely done now I went with a
grey lippy I was probably inspired by
the background but I kind of like this
like it's a little bit different for me
however I really wanted to share with
you mainly on the kind of highlighting
contouring and foundation routine so you
guys can see exactly what I like to do I
kind of sort look like me and I feel
like my face doesn't really transform
that much of makeup but you know what I
want my face to look good when I'm
putting on makeup and to feel
comfortable all day wearing it okay so
I'm going to do something a little bit
different in this video and I'm going to
show you the exact time right now and
I'm going to come back to you at the end
of the days you can see what I look like
it's 11 it's 11 a.m. right now 11 a.m.
so I'll catch you at the end of the day
okay guys I am back I'm exhausted I am
to go to bed right now all I want to do
is take my makeup off snatch this unit
off and go to bed
12 hours Oh 12 hours and that 15 minutes
later 23 15 right now cooking being out
doing errands looking after ababy
having friends over that's what today is
consisted of however I still feel like I
look relatively okay obviously I'm an
oily person associates all over the
stove I cook a lot and I cook for like
an hour and a half today so I find that
obviously the oil seeps through but you
know this isn't mad mad oily but what I
will say about the concealer is that
like lychee where the concealer was is
glitchy super matte and no no creasing
the only thing is that I find as well
that when I rub my face a lot I kind of
touch my face a lot that I find that I'm
losing weight come off of it but
disappearing from around here but
overall I feel like I look virtually the
same and in general I'm just feeling
this look would you guys think all right
guys I'm jabbering on because I'm tired
and I need to go to bed so I will catch
you later bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
