the wind going on like where's Janice
good morning how are you doing welcome
back to the vlogs interesting fact I've
done my makeup today and I did test it
with a capital D I'm about to bravely
wipe it off
no about to do my makeup again and
coming up that school of thought that
less is genuinely more I don't like how
I look with loads of makeup on I like it
clown like an actual crown and I feel
very abnormal so taking off gonna start
again that's how we're starting is rock
today I love asking you guys questions
like we're actually together but yeah
how are you doing I feel actually feel
better looking without makeup on and
that's a that's actually quite a good
thing to say not stuck up or anything I
just look more like myself do I not look
better without makeup on I'm one of I
think I'm one of those weird people who
I don't look good too much they with
heavy makeup I look ridiculous okay get
ready for the day got this little jump
on you guys probably so it for my
ageless haul I have just got in a parcel
that I'm so excited about I have to show
you like documents include this I got an
email that I received something from I
think it was like the Netherlands it was
like oh what is that this has come in
from clues clues watches if you guys
don't know clues is a watch brand and I
am a huge fan of negging Megan is a
blogger Instagram art she also has a
youtube and she has a watch
collaboration with clues hold on
oh sorry I had to make the sound oh I
didn't know it came like this okay guys
this is what they sent me this is the
box these are the straps and this is the
classic watch so nice how gorgeous is
the packaging so so so gorgeous I love a
nice rose gold watch it's so classic and
simple in design to be honest I knew
they were sending this to me they have
sent it to me and they wanted me to let
you guys know about the collaboration oh
there's even an extra watch I thought I
was just getting the negging watch
so yeah the negging watch comes like
this and it's the rose gold watch along
with the suede dress but also they sent
me another clue swatch okay nice you've
got some texture going on here
I am definitely becoming more of a
watched girl the rose gold is about to
be me today hey guys I said this in my
last vlog that I'm gonna try and show
you my outfits every day and a lot of
people asked how do I actually wear some
of the clothes that I buy well here you
can see I love today's outfit I forget
in my legs out quite a lot recently
this is this jumper from Miss from a
Zoe's but it's from Miss Selfridges of
course I have this clues watch on though
it's rose gold it looks really nice too
like my gold stuff of my bags gold and
then I think this cut was actually
wrongly and these are the shoes that
were from public design but here's
today's outfit yes I should be wearing a
jacket but I'm not gonna wear a jacket
because I'm gonna get in the car so this
room is about to be kitted out for
Christmas we know exactly how we want to
decorate this room now I've got to
console tables going in there we're
getting this floor sanded and then it's
also going to get a wash on it so it
won't be so yellow got a big rug and you
get a coffee table kind of get rid of
the blinds it's got it's gonna be
amazing so I feel like it's taking nine
months
to get this house to like really be
where we want it to be but we're getting
there and I think everything happens at
its own time don't rush life okay don't
much life it happens
somehow I sneaked in and all t treat no
still go to eat it's all I don't even
like it eats the whole thing doesn't
share it I took one bite she goes oh let
me have a bit I don't even like it
consumes the entire doughnut this is
quite a nice little coffee table 700
pounds
Jesus expensive we just bought
I just bought some furniture my mind
they do like me but I bought some
furniture we were banging things about
me like my approval yeah how dare you
John I decided that too many cooks
having a very good day right now I
basically realize too many cooks for the
block trying to get my husband and me to
agree on design doesn't quite work say I
just do it by myself
we're gonna try to make over home now
good pick up grace yeah not really
I want Matt Delmont I was like guys
coming tonight I'm gonna have a snack
before dinner
cuz I'm starving so tonight we're having
guests round we're cooking together
cooking is my compactions
he's done my training I'm basically head
chef yeah so I'm like Gordon Ramsay you
are kind of like Michaels dessert sets
out
what Michael said he was gonna serve I
was like he'll die coming please scrap
that inside again so cooking forget now
slots one it's spicy I do enjoy the fact
that my spiralizer comes out when we
have guests see the one did I'm gonna
try I'm not having any rice I'm just
gonna have a minimal rice so instead I'm
gonna round oh wow it's actually quite
cool have you ever seen me spiralizing
before no it's kind of like looks like
spaghetti or something it's my cuts cuts
courgette courgette spaghetti whoa look
at that
my mind is blown are you being sarcastic
no have you never seen a spiralizer
why doesn't got that chode thing coming
at the middle they've seen me I've seen
it I don't think most people have seen a
spiralizer before I have nay what an
action yes babe
no no I think this is I don't think
everybody no I don't think most people
use a spiralizer if you're a cooking for
a cooking enthusiast maybe
being race are going to have you Jetson
Italy that's pretty cool we cook the
penis that ever ends up at the end of it
that isn't what you do with that I like
where Jonas burns good when you can
entertain yourself and get yourself
happy but funny they're your best ones

you guys to join in is yet snatched get
snatch for winter not get snatched your
summer gotta be prepared now cuz I you
know you guys know what I'm like have a
nice I'm quite honestly the fact that

straight up and down in a washer tooth
shaped and what tooth shapes which to
yeah working out part of the part of
routine think also rice makes me
extremely bloated like literally drives
the other day and I looked five months

about what their hell that you're making
announcement
definitely not pregnant you were
pregnant with the rice baby
today's been a while how could a picture
of grace she's exodia today's been a
workday you'll be completely honest with
you my reality is that I work every day
so I spend a lot of time on my laptop I
spend a lot of time on phone calls or
emails and then after I'll pick up the
camera I really pick up the camera while
I'm just sitting at my desk not doing
very much but it's about three o'clock
canal and I just realized it's time to
get Christmassy we're gonna get two
Christmas trees because obviously we
have a kitchen and dining area and we
also have a living room area as well so
let me go pick up some Christmas trees I
want like a seven-foot Christmas tree
how it's also good for like that's what
Christmas tree doesn't actually for that
big but when we go pick up a Christmas
tree and I'm gonna go get my eyelashes
done today at a lush bar
I do have falsies on today but bitchy
just the ones at the very essays at the
very edges that's my house she quite
quiet when no one's and my cousin around
grace is at nursery so I tried to do is
like try and do everything before she's
back what you guys know so I'm gonna go
ahead and bring you along Christmas tree
shopping this is the earliest I've ever
been this prepared but I feel pressure
I feel like internet pressure to be like
Christmas ready like dry first week of
December and I didn't think I'd give in
but yeah now I'm right now I need to be
Christmas ready I'm gonna be the person
who goes wow they all sit in here okay
let's see what they got this is a tree
that I want I want one that's already
got snow on it and yes I like a fake
tree makes my life easier I want
everything this is the tree a one I
think it's really cute but it's really
heavy I'm gonna get Mike to come in and
pick them up and I'm probably gonna get
something like that outside my house
I'm gonna be that person I've just taken
with my eye makeup but is to go in I
mean nothing lady tell me what I'm gonna
do I didn't tell me on camera 13 okay
yeah I don't know what any of that means
though it's like on mid-weight set so
yeah not too natural but not too
dramatic that's how we're going now
that's amazingly nuts but I suppose hey
guys I'm done I thought my lashes done
he even tell well yes you can but how
nice they look was so easy I got back in
it didn't actually take that long it
took like an hour and a half and then
I've just been cheating with the family

you guys know I take my skin curve
relatively seriously this is like
today's a detox day so what I do a clean
mask as well but you've seen that my
nightstand if you follow me on snapchat
