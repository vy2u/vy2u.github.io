winter lookbook and after we did the TK
Maxx style identity survey we thought
why not put this together finally enough
when I did my survey again with the
times
I was actually romance with a hint of
retro it sounds a little bit more like
me so first things first is denim you
can't go wrong with denim at all and I
love this pair because they're a little
bit different they're not something I
would normally do but why not be braver
and go for something that's ripped like
these even in the winter
so in this outfit I've got
denim-on-denim which is okay actually
because one is a lot darker than the
other and I like it it's kind of relaxed
and casual but it also looks neat but
without having made too much effort here
so next is the jumper or cardigan in
this case and in the past I never would
have worn anything like this but I'm
much more used to it now much more
comfortable and I've drained it up with
a casual t-shirt and some dark jeans and
yeah it's kind of relax and be like me
so next I'm wearing like oversized
sweatshirt and I actually love this
super casual super warm and you guys
know that I love my leather leggings and
another thing I actually love to wear as
an essential is a beanie hat can't go
wrong with one of these
so you really do need to have something
a little bit more dressy in your
wardrobe as well so little black dress
is a wardrobe essential even in the
winter because you've got lots of
Christmas parties and New Year's parties
to attend I love this one because it's
kind of a line but I also love body con
dresses as well
so this outfit is all about the black
blazer basically you can put a blazer
with anything and it will smile up a
little bit I've got just a casual white
shirt and some dark jeans on this outfit
I'm having a great time and yeah it just
makes a normal outfit look sharp and
check out my clothes
so next is all about the outerwear and I
must say I love an oversized camel
jacket
I saw this in TK Maxx and I think it
went perfectly with my romantic style
and I'm just wearing this tweed style
jacket which cause my retro style
so guys I hope you enjoyed that video
and it gave you a couple of ideas for
the festive season now make sure you
guys take this style identity survey
like we did and I put it in the
description bar below</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
