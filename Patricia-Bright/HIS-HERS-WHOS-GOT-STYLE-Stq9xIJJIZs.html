a good song hey guys to my channel and
look who I have here with me hi guys and
so we are getting into the Christmas
season and I thought I would do cover
little specials
I brought Mike in he's gonna do two
videos with me this month what is
November and December he's very excited
about last I don't the camera baby we're
actually gonna do a video on like style
which is very very cool and this is
going to be like a teapot and hopefully
we're gonna do like a little style look
but but we're trying to be a bit braver
and do things that we wouldn't normally
do so we're going to be doing a style
test which is in association with TK
Maxx and the times going to work out our
style identities but first I thought we
would basically talk about what our
spell was like and what it's currently
like today and then we're gonna take the
test and then see what our actual
identity is when I first met you you
were still a student and you're still
quite young and excitable even more
excitable that she is now when you
believe it so I would say that you had
more like a street style thing going on
so you had kind of like what's a pedal
pusher and you had them like shiny thing
with like deterrence by a curved plastic
is it like PVC what did that that was
PVC not that but maybe I'm exaggerating
a bit here but it was all very kind of
almost garish but wonderful but I think
was a bit more kind of Street part a
disco raver type so I'm gonna describe
my which was know stuff
just like this right that was virtually
like if you can finally go easy no you
can find it in the Teresa come on
it fits you get to go and sportswear
because Michael is very sporty them you
all lot of sportswear and I think it's
definitely developed through the years
and you've got a bit more sophisticated
as well and I find a bit more refined a
bit more sharp and at least he wears
stuff that picked him because Michael
used to hate wearing clothes I wear
medium I don't that you always go for
large or extra-large every single time
these was I was buff back then so I had
to wear bigger things the other wise
it's two tasks I can't have a tight
crotch grabbing trash I mean every time
I'm aware at top that was medium my arms
would just be blowing out the side my
chest to be sticking out I just look
like one of those guys is just desperate
for attention so should we do this style
and identity test I know this I'm gonna
put a link to this test in the
description box so I really want you
guys to do it as well and let me know in
the comments what your spy that IPS are
are we gonna find out other than that so
basically people are able to discover
their style identity and transform your
shopping habits so you have four or five
different ones which is retro glamour
romance bold or Street tip chick I think
I would be glamour
what would you be do think I I think you
would be glamour crossed with street
chick what would you be and I think I
would be quiet well yes retro granddad
style especially with that - maybe retro
that definitely wet-dry be romance Thank
You romanza
how I dress for my wife
it's
it's a good song yeah like you guys made
sure you do the test and let me know
what your style IDs are so we're just
gonna go ahead and do this now question
number one your dress style is mainly
inspired by celebs what you see in shops
are to culture the catwalk people you've
met places you'll be you think -
definitely people I've met so which of
these images resonates most with you
mine's going to be always the Tiger the
tiger resonates of me definitely yeah
I'm gonna go for the Tigers well you
can't keep going for the same a week I
like the tiger okay fine Tiger my my
Sonya the most stylish couple is Gwen
Stefani Gavin rotten Dale Prince William
Kate Middleton victoria and David
Beckham Elizabeth Taylor and Richard
Burton and Elton John and David Furnish
I'm gonna have to say Elton but I'm
gonna say you even said I'm gonna say
becomes I'm gonna say the back end which
of these environments immediately
appealed to you oh this is a hard one
I'm gonna pick the beach which I'm gonna
pick them no I'm not gonna pick the
beach oh yeah pick it pick it as well
when it comes to your wardrobe habit
you're most likely to hang onto clothes
that have an emotional meaning to you
throw away old to make way for new and
exciting things try to create new looks
with what you have quickly get rid of
anything that looks dated and cherish
quality garments that are hard to obtain
I know you're one mine is out throw away
ultimate need for exciting looks you
also be cherish that oh this thing yeah
hold on hold on let me explain if you
have something that's good quality okay
and it's got a bit history behind it
you're gonna keep it yeah
so why are you picking I'm gonna pick
cherish Christie comments which I agree
with it but I woman like you said I have
like water clear out sand okay gone
they're gone so which color block most
reflects your wardrobe Oh
for me it's like this these two on the
end I think mines gonna go I'm gonna go
for the creams Browns and I think mine's
gonna be the one in the end if you find
yourself a party your dress completely
different to everybody else what do you
do okay
so enjoy the chunks enjoy it as a chance
to stand out
don't worry and you rarely notice what
others wear hang around people that look
most like you see it's a chance to get
noticed or find an excuse to leave mine
will be not worry
I rarely notice what other no I actually
noticed what other people were I
wouldn't be worried about what I'm
wearing based on what other people wear
I think I might enjoy this down to
heaven I thank you all stand a halter
give it a chance to go on a perfect date
you would opt for a date a music
festival I trip to the Orient Express a
day at a theme park a shopping trip to
Paris I think that might go well it or a
country walk and a picnic by the river I
like shopping trip to Paris but I love a
walk you can't pick through you've got
to pick one I'm always taking me to
Paris I'm gonna read it - no thank you
so on that note I'm going to have to be
honest which is actually a country walk
and a picnic by the river
your romantic hi oh my gosh we have
different style identities I was going
to be the same no okay mine is Street
trick I said this though no accent of
glamour that's exactly what I said
oh yes my girls shoots this was how done
yeah Mika's retro did we not say retro
with a hint his accent
style is bold and I said bold but I
think that fair enough that it's fair
enough
actually what that was really cool well
done TK Maxx and the times of creating
that Stein identity testy should
actually do it with your partner if you
can or like with a friend as he for the
same would you date with your friends I
think make sure you do I'm going to link
it in the description bar below so you
guys can check it out as well and we are
actually gonna do a style video lookbook
featuring me featured Michael yes thanks
Kay a dream my modelling it may be very
sarcastic right now but I will do that
and based on it so we're gonna try
something we wouldn't normally do and
we're gonna try and be a little bit
braver and we'll see what we can have
the year in the next few weeks so all
right we'll see you later and enjoy the
Christmas season</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
