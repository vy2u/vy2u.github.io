video for you and I've got um stuff from
H&amp;amp;M Primark and some vintage stuff as
well so I hope you like it
I'm gonna make it really I had this cute
lace top crop top which is from H&amp;amp;M and
I love it it's black lace and it's floor
of like a floral pattern it's cute and
it's a crop top but my aim is actually
to wear it with high-waisted trousers so
you shouldn't really be seeing any flip
also bought this red dress from H&amp;amp;M and
it comes with the waist belt and all of
a sudden got into red so I think I'll
probably be wearing more of it and this
is something that I want to wear to work
or you know for dinner or something like
that it's still corporate but still nice
at the same time I've also bought this
lovely lovely shirt and it's got rolled
sleeves like that I just love and yet I
love monochrome I love black and I love
white so you can get it both with one
shirt but it's a really nice fabric as
well it's really soft on the skin so
I've also bought another thing that's
really big this season is like animal
prints so I've got this cheetah print
dress which is it is Q okay I'm not
gonna look like Pat butcher but this is
really really cute I really like this
dress
and it's a really nice 55 mark I've
bought another snowed or stood I don't
know how to say it look my sister always
tells me off but bought another one of
these and do you know what I just love
it it's so warm and cute on looks just
like this you know and once it starts
snowing you guys are going to be jealous
of me in this you know also bought a
jumpsuit from Primark and this jumpsuit
is so nice I love the fabric I love the
pattern on it
it's monochrome again I love my kind of
black and whites as I said before and it
looks just like this and I've got a
video and how to wear jumpsuit dress it
down and dress it up and you should be
able to see that in that video okay so
those are the two prime Martin the
vintage items I have one thing I've
wanted recently was a quilted jacket and
I've been here thinking should I get a
barber Jack here or something different
and I went into benardos in it down Bond
Street and I actually went on like a
vintage shop mission trying to find all
the secret ones around London and I came
across this quilted quilted jacket in
tan in camel which was really in this
season and it's had to buy em I only
paid 25 pounds for that is this changing
color yeah I only paid 20 pounds of that
so that is definitely a bargain I've
also got this shirt which is also
vintage I just love the blue I love the
pattern and love the shoulder pads and I
love the rap over on this show and I
just had to get it and I know how I'm
gonna wear that this is cute I love it I
know guys I hoped you liked that video
and I shall see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
