video is gonna be an absolutely huge
horde well huge in my opinion you know
holiday season his hair I like to you
know dress up and really when going out
during this season so I went to forever
21 H&amp;amp;M Zara divided metas are neither
thicker winters are actually and Topshop
and I was there too like 10 o'clock at
night I also wanted to do a holidays and
black outfits so gummed up and leave
comments if you'd want to see um the
video which were features from the bits
and bobbies from this cool so let me go
ahead and get started so first of all I
bought this kind of crop sixty swing top
from Topshop and I loved it because the
pea size and everything and the fit of
it is so 60s and I'm not so new likes to
wear skulls and all that jazz but I
wanted something that had lots of motifs
as before so that's from Topshop so I
have a lot of session with like camel
and mustard and stuff like that and
there's someone who's 10 I watched her
name is spell emphasis I believe and she
is on of my channel you can see kind of
the people that I'm subscribed to at the
top she's at the very top she's amazing
right and she has bizarre magical and I
believe Shirley also has but I couldn't
find that jacket which I was wanted to
get so I went into Topshop and I found
this alternative jacket and it's like in
that lovely camel color and it was from
the vintage section I'm happy news from
oh my love concession and there was only
fifty fifty pounds and I got Kempson off
as well so for five pounds it's a
beautiful wall it's really really thick
it's got really cool pockets and it's
really unique it's not like it's not a
chain I think there's only like ten or
these
it's there so I hope you can see it and
it's kind of got a really big fit I love
this and I think it's a bargain for
woollen Jackie so you guys it's partly
season so I've got Sparkle and that one
tears and glitter crazy and I ended up
picking up this dress which is from I
just looked at about the screen I look
like a Christmas tree this is one of t f
NZ and a concession in Topshop and I
used to hate that brand but this stuff
has really improved and I love this God
dress and it will really suit my body
shape really well because I like fitted
dresses and this black one yeah oh yeah
oh yeah
New Year's Eve you thinking like I'm
thinking yeah this is really really cute
and again this suits my body shades and
I was thinking you know when I'm on the
beach in Mauritius we get a candlelit
dinner on the beach and but yes this
would be the dress that I wear this
sorry guys I'm so excited like for
myself forgive me right so yeah give her
sequins and shorts so I picked up these
shorts I wear them with ties again I'm
gonna do a party outfits video if you
guys like this and leave comments I'll
definitely do one and I'll show you how
I wear these shorts another pair as well
today's I'm probably only going to keep
one of these I want it to decide between
the black or the green which one do you
prefer black or green I've bought this
shirt as well this is again from TNF
the concession and it's like a bright
cobalt blue it's looking a bit different
but it's got this really nice um
detailing on the front and it's got hole
in the back like that and it's long at
the back and short at the front
beautiful finally I picked up this
necklace there's spikes and the bit bits
of diamante skiner and it's got kind of
suede gray straps here okay bouquets go
from hey Chinna my book knows when hmm
first I've got this red bag this kind of
satchel bag and I really wanted a
satchel and you guys not hate leather
that isn't real but I've just spent like
a lot of money on another bags come on
hey let's get some faux leather and in a
bright red and it's really pretty it's
got lots of room so this would be like
an everyday bag for me and they bought
this really cute dress again I don't
know where I think I'm going you know
boy this dress and it's velvet and I
think I started having a little bit of
an obsession with velvet because I mean
ER she's always wearing felt with it all
the time and as I said blue velvet the
other teeth and it's that got pointy
baby bits I love that
and I bought this shirt which is creased
it but it's not meant to be closed like
that but um it's been in the bag and
it's again it's short at the front and
long at the top I wish you could see it
a bit better than that I'll show it to
you on it's a really nice fabric but it
looks like it's going to take a lot of
effort to iron and I bought 2 Peter Pan
collars worn in a black so for those of
you who just want to change up any shirt
this is a really good idea I don't think
it was more than six pounds
it's like that and then I bought one in
gold gold in sequins for the festivities
and that goes around right there
and then you try it not not with your
hair obviously I had an obsession for
these rings these like mini rings I wish
you could see the detailing I know my
camera doesn't focus at one hand so if
anyone's looking for a cheap pair of
Chelsea boots I bought these in a hmm
for 30 pounds they're really nice they
fit really well
only thing I hate is this bloody Hill so
I might sequin it up like starts with it
and I've decided I like them and they
don't make my feet look big for those of
you who don't know my feet are huge and
I have a problem you're wearing low
heels yeah they're really nice like that
so these are something I really wanted
to show you and brings again I bought
these rings which I love love love love
they look so expensive but her like
$5.99 I love those and those combined
with these so I got these in the goal
this all one of these which have got a
mixture of gold and silver when you can
imagine it like everything about looking
fabulous sticking with accessories
almost a god I also got some bits and
bobs from fabbi
on lining comm which I was actually sent
but I've been having these pieces like
all the time one of them is this feather
ring which you've seen me wear in all
those My Week in my water of videos I've
been wearing
all the time it's a party and I also got
a pair of these
owl earrings I'm not much of an earring
wearer to be honest but I thought that
these were I picked these ones and I
thought these are really nice they're
just pretty and I love the fact that
they've got the blue eyes there and this
being my favorite piece is this climbing
van which is mini but literally is like
a aircraft but it looks like a man is
climbing up your ear basically they have
it gross but very cool and chic so maybe
when I do an updo hairstyle I'll show
you what that looks like
let's go on to forever 21 so I bought
this sequin the snow there's kind of
forties got out a like 40 styles there
and I love the fact that it's got these
this beading on the bottom this is all
beading and just the way it looks it
looks more expensive than it is it was
20 pounds but it looks quite elegant and
actually the fabric is not too about her
to have to say clap your hands forever
21
clap for yourself they also bought this
book this shirt from forever 21 which is
beautiful because I love anything we've
kind of as techie prints anything with
squares and triangles put together don't
know what my problem is I could just
love this stuff so this is perfect and
it's kind of a sheer fabric
but yeah I love that and I bought this
shirt with all these this beef cats on
here and it's really cool because it has
a hole in the sleeves and it's so long
to be shot like that and finally I
bought these sequin leggings but I think
that's quite big I will definitely say
for those of you who are looking for
outfits for New Year's or parties that
you want to go to
Topshop had an amazing selection
especially in that concession area if
you want some sparkle and since patent
go you know you want to be dad's up
everywhere yeah again if you want to see
