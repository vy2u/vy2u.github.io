hello gorgeous fantastic beautiful
amazing people welcome to my channel I
hope you are doing well today I'm
excited I'm excited again and today
we're about to get back into fancy
beauty okay we're about to get back into
printing beauty my last joy basically
did I mean two million views yeah it's a
lot it's a lot especially as my makeup
looks particularly unblended and like No
and I didn't realize at the time of like
filming and editing but I'm watching bad
I know like it was a little bit like my
eyebrows are doing one kind of halo
effect because I had gone in with the
foundation that was a little bit darker
than my skin and I was all kind of
carried away I'm always excited anyway
it's fun but you guys love me and I love
you but we're revisiting one because
when TBT has released the new galaxy
collection and I have a couple of items
from the galaxy collection hello and if
you don't know the collection basically
consists of new cosmic gloss glitters
starlight hyper glitz lipstick and of
course a new 14 piece eyeshadow palette
now I'm going to keep it a hundred a
hundred a hundred thousand percent rule
with you guys I saw their eyeshadow
palette and I was like some of these
shades they were to be honest it wasn't
my favorite kind of eyeshadow palette
because there was a lot of glitz and
glam and glitter and shine and sparkle
and there weren't any maps and I'm like
am I gonna just have a disco ball eyelid
like I don't really know how I'm gonna
make this work and I watch some of the
tutorials there's lots of greens and
blues and grays which are shades that I
personally don't like how I look in them
but overall I wasn't like yeah this is
gonna be my go-to palette this is like
you know it was shiny in a shiny shiny
shiny engine no so I'm not going to
relieve the palate because I don't have
it but I had to show you the new goodies
that I got in front of NT Beauty the
team were kind enough to send me they
sent me an edit of the kitchen just for
me I'm so excited
I'm so happy but I'm kind of mad because
I've already bought all of these I have
all of these I own all of them already I
use my own coin to buy them so I'm gonna
give some away and if you keep watching
the video I'll tell you exactly how I'm
gonna give just a big selection of Fenty
PT items away they've also got the lip
peas and the line up from the new galaxy
connection but never fear I've got
something else extra new as well got I
received from Anastasia Beverly Hills
can we just look at the greatness look
at this the prism palette the blush kit
the grow kit lippies and a liquid
lipsticks and just everything I'm so
excited so we're going to get into we've
got all we need
okay so the first item in the collection
is the fenty beauty primer and to be
honest with you I'm not going to use the
primer I use the primer a few very few
times and I found it to be more of a
primer that is great if you have drier
skin but if you really want that
blurring effect this is more like a
moisturizing primer I like something a
little bit more heavy duty so I'm gonna
go in with the white cell all ours
primer this primer gives me heavy duty
so when it came to the foundation I
picked up the shade 450 and not gonna
lie it did oxidize it did go darker so i
rectified this situation okay we've had
to rectify it so I tried to get 440
which is the shade I think I am and
honestly I just couldn't find it
anywhere it was always sold out so I've
got 4:30 and then I'm gonna mix it with
my 450 we're just gonna make it work
make it work it's a little redder than I
remember mm-hmm let's just keep going
I'm not scared when I see a foundation
that's like kind of red or a bit
oversaturated because it can look a
little bit orange sometimes but
eventually kind of blends and cools down
and again this does go a bit darker that
is on it dries really matte I'm looking
at my I feel like it looks a little bit
orange I think there's a little bit more
red undertones in this one and I've got
more yellow undertones but the way it
makes my space look and I'd listen I
look like a porcelain doll if I do this
in myself I do like the way it makes my
skin look but the shade is a little
Oompa Loompa so the next item in Fenty
beauty is which I reviewed the last time
is the matchsticks and I used Lotte and
what I found was was that it was a
little cold for me and also a little dry
so I need a little bit more moisture
I've got like Exmark it can get a little
bit wrinkly so I like something a little
bit more creamy and you guys I swear you
see me with this every other day it's
the Kevin Lacroix answer to enhancer
which is very creamy and very yellow
but we've discussed this I'm not scared
of yellow I like yellow
however the match tip that I did really
really like and have been using time and
time again is this one in espresso this
is such a nice contour actually genuine
like it's really nice and chocolate and
dark like look at that
listen that is just giving me angles
complete angles I'm still eating the pie
so I do need to contour because the chin
is growing and then it's great around my
nose I'm just gonna blend that all in oh
I never have this the last time this is
the portable touch-up brush oh I love it
it's so dinky look at this it does this
so cute right so next up I'm gonna go
ahead and I'm going to try the invisible
blotting powder I didn't get the chance
to try this the last time okay so
normally I'm very very cautious about
using you know Universal or translucent
powders because often they have me
looking great I look casket ready
however as I'm using this it's not doing
that that's wonderful it's really nicely
mattifying everything as well mmm
wow that's not bad that's really good
yes check that out I don't look great I
do not look casket ready yes no Casper
the Friendly Ghost here face is done
we're gonna go in with the prison
palette from Anastasia Beverly Hills and
then I'm gonna act like some unicorn and
stuff like that just to give me that
current galaxy Fenty where I'm in a way
that works for me listen it looks like
sex like at yours it's it's smooth and
dark and gold and oh my god this is
black and gold black and gold black
there's a lot of Blues in in here as
well but there's the pinks and the
oranges but I need and maps to just
balance it out if you're not really he I
don't wanna I wanna be next to you come
on there I can go back and go it for
every moment in my life there is a song
black and gold what should we do
I've got this parallel parallel huh
firstly I'm gonna go in with this kind
of orange shades pick up pick up that
just was an instant pickup and a lot of
people had some issues with the fallout
and the last one but this is this is
just giving me pickhardt and no fallout
for me I'm a brown gold orange Pink's
kind of go know I might I might actually
do a little blue something go in with
learn me in now let me in it's so pretty
that's beautiful maybe I should not run
away from these kind of colors maybe I
should just live a little
then I'm gonna go in with this brown
hair cord parallel and needs a blend ah
die menschen for you guys I'm going to
clear it so we're gonna be glitz I need
to swatch I'm gonna swatch that shade is
called dimension a shade here is called
throne and what I did notice on the
galaxy palette that there weren't any
matte shades so every time I've seen
their tutorial people have had to use
another palette to create a look because
you can't create a look if entire
glitters I'm gonna go in with dimension
on my lid I'm just gonna do a little bit
here because me and glitter or dimension
okay I'm not scared I'm scared I am
scared Goethe literally and sparkle I'm
facing my fears one eyeshadow stroke at
a time there's a there's a dark green
here could threaten I'm gonna use that
underneath
we're just gonna we're just gonna roll
and then I'm gonna go in with this
gorgeous gold called pyramid just in my
inner tear duct so next I'm going to go
with Eclipse this is one of the two in
one liners I don't know how it's two in
one I think it's because it's black but
also shiny is it even black though it's
kind of like a green it's green but like
dark like da da dark emerald green get
turnt the shade is called Neptune
Neptune Wow
okay let's go in not gonna lie how how
sick is this package in though how sick
is that emerald green eyeliner okay fine
net turn here we go so that liner is
really really creamy really really
creamy the applicator is really really
really good really really easy to use
and even though it's a kind of greeny
colour it's a subtle green it's not like
green eyeliner it's like a really dark
rich next I'm gonna go in with the
matchstick whoa I haven't actually seen
this in person like oh wow
have you seen a lot of their looks that
man has done recently I went to an event
she was wearing this shade it was like
this it looks grey on me oh I heard this
was the shade she was wearing this
doesn't look what she was wearing this
doesn't look like it this is not giving
me unicorn this is giving me sand dunes
let us go in with I might go in with
your life let's see that your life looks
like bit more warmth yes let's go in
with some your your life and I'm then
gonna go in with a kilowatt and I'm
gonna go in with the one I actually
genuinely use on a regular basis and it
is ginger binge Moscow Mule this combo
is very real and I feel looks the best
on me although I still love like trophy
wife for like a special occasion this is
like an everyday one where you weren't
blind people you know right I just line
my eyes and put
lashes on and I feel really cute ok so
there are no brushes with the fenty
Beauty just yet so I'm gonna go in with
the blush kit from Anna's Nadia and to
burnish Mike listen I hope this is first
impression I haven't seen this what the
hell is this
where's this greatness hmm tell me be
rich together please can we just be rich
together this is rude this shade is
route is beautiful this is gorgeous this
is like a contour
I feel like movies like the Carla listen
we're just gonna be a move Queen let's
just be a move Queen let's just be a
queen together or queen yes pretty oh my
gosh okay so these are the lip glosses I
have look at these
shall we swatch let's watch you see how
that line is kind of green let's watch
this shining shining shining shining and
then let's watch this one
look at this shade here this shade is
called space suit this shade is called
astronaut II is a very iridescent
sparkly glittery really really pigmented
there's a lot there's a lot of color in
this how just how do you wear it though
where are you wearing this to tell me if
you're getting this were you wearing
this tube and then this is the lipstick
Wow
it's called starlet there's loads in
here I love the shape could star lit and
again it's like an iridescent purple
okay it's not as look at that it's kind
of I'm gonna go in for astronaut
first I'm gonna focus it on the outside
of my lips
it's got a little bit of a tinkle going
on mmm it looks quite sheer doesn't it
the glitter in it is nice but it's
actually quite subtle it isn't a like an
extreme cinema and it is very similar to
the fenty glow but with a little bit
more purple in it I'm gonna put the
lighter shades on the inside Spacey I
was think yeah this has got some space
effect going on in here mate look
darling I'm alright at myself Wow I'm
literally where I got myself
hey guys that is my finished look is
again it's different for me it's very
different for me I am more of a brown
beige gold kind of girl so it
immediately went purples and pinks like
this it's a it's a little bit hmm but I
like it my hobby thinks I look pretty I
was just nothing just now and people
like yeah they love it so okay I'm here
for it I'm definitely here for it but
overall for me the galaxy collection
isn't my kind of thing even though even
though we're these kind of like sorry
pinky purpley eyes I'm like I wouldn't
invest and but the lips I'm feeling
feeling feeling these on the lips
because it's not like glittery lips it's
not like metallic it's more like a hint
of glitter and it's a very similar
formula to the fenty globe lip gloss so
yeah I think that's it what do you guys
think am I giving you one thought am i
giving you like a rude way got my rude
boy boy I do like it though I do like it
okie dokie anyway I think I'm done and
