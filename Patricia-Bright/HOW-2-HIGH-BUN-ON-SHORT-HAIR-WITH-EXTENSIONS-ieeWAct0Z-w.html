you how I do a high bun like this anyone
asking why I just a chance YouTube it's
everybody so you guys a Michael Maureen
are disgusted with me saying hi guys I'd
never give getting very boring I'm gonna
say hi guys anymore so I'm a try
oh if you speak any other languages
write them down so I can do my
introduction in those languages so did a
little bit of Italian
gutentag gonna be in German and holla
holla get out Spanish Thank You Sandra
yeah so today's video is going to be my
high bun and it's just really quick from
it's like just the cooler cools down so
if you're cool you can go ahead with
this it's actually really easy to do
another do you have hair extensions in
the top as well so that's what you guys
here is my hair for those of you have
never seen my hair before it is relaxed
and but I have a lot of texture in my
hair so my hair is very very easy to
like move around and everything so you
just kind of comb it up I've actually
already combed mine and work on what
direction you want your hair to go into
and just kind of make some idea where do
you want your bun to be so usually with
a high bun style the bun is actually
quite forward
so my buns partly here let me take your
hairband and twirl it around and make
sure the backs in otherwise it will just
look like a turn it
so it's almost like an instant facelift
so you can either just twist that one
around and then there is literally the
easiest hi barman you could put pins in
it as well to kind of give it the shape
you require and if you've got some loose
bits you can just kind of pin that pin
it up or something like that
however unlit some hair I don't know
funny dentures
I'll show you what I would do if I
wanted a bigger bun with help fusions in
crack so you ever need one or two
depending on you know how thick you
going on the tract and I get one pin and
I open the pin up and I slide it through
the top of the track so like it hangs on
the track like that then I put that
through under under the bun leave that
free then literally I start to wrap this
all around and I kind of connect it on
to where the other end of the pin came
out as well okay so then with the other
loose ends
I got another pin put it through and
then push it under leave again so I'm
ended up with this nice little what you
can call it pineapple the hairstyle and
then I just get this
but you don't to look too big otherwise
you will look like a conet so kind of
twist it as much as you can you I'm not
either being so I mean you look chatting
away I love y'all don't look at me there
you go there was the high bun with
extensions so I hoped you liked that
video folks watching guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
