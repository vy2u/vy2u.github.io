today's video is actually going to be on
how to wear chinos but also how to wear
high-waisted trousers so I've been lucky
enough to get kind of chinos that are
high-waisted as well so yeah it's a
great mix and hopefully a great tutorial
I just want to quickly say thank you to
all of you who comes up my other fashion
videos because it kind of helps me to
kind of gauge what to do next so I
definitely know that you look like these
videos I'm gonna keep doing that I'm
gonna do another video which is on how
to wear lingerie on the outside but I
would like you to thumbs up this video
if you would like to see that so I can
put it together and edit it and stuff
like that so I want to waste my time or
waste your time but anyway guys I hope
you enjoyed this video kinda out outside
with my chinos on so we can see that
these chinos are high waisted and I
bought these from big buck in Oxford
Circus I've never really been in there
before but this was a fatty dessert
first time I went in there and picked up
these high-waisted chinos and
and this is more or less the cut the
standard to wear chinos I will repair
cares or some just some flat canvas
shoes and a white shirt or top on the
inside so this is kind of the athletes
way to do it
so this is how you can wear this with a
cropped slouchy top now this is the
latest one which is a little see-through
but we can just kind of get with this
season's crouching swing tops and that
looks really nice with searching it is
crouching ouchy ouchy keep it slouchy
you swing top and you can wear vest on
the inside I'm comfortable is a problem
for a jacket over it but yeah it's
really kind of casual and nice
this is my favorite way for growing but
here is kind of a really nautical way if
you see the Unicode and relatives I
think it's got your hands she's got a
nice drive to place
I think the stripes it's really nice
with the chinos so you can probably get
navy stripe red and white striped
t-shirt or a vest and I feel really
really confident the same for nice then
probably put a jacket on it
this is the final dur and this is
now look so you can definitely dress up
chinos I still haven't put on a night
out maybe put in this a nice black ankle
boots which of my other ankle boots that
I wear all the time right with a black
corsets a nice jewelry if you want to
your hair up just get ready for a night
on the town the nice black blazer nice
Coach bag as well
and that's the end of this video and I
hope you like a DVD
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
