video is going to be on my skincare and
I'm quite excited about doing this
because you guys have noticed an
improvement in my skin and so many
people have been asking about my
skincare regime and I don't know why
it's taking me so long to do it I
apologize but I'm finally doing it and
I'm going to tell you guys a couple of
my secrets a couple of the things that I
do to clear my skin and I'm gonna not
talk about it but I'm going to show you
exactly what I do but I wanted to give
you a quick idea of what my skin is
actually like and it's not perfect not
at all and some of you guys do such
lovely comments I'm like if you only
knew girl but basically I have a
combination skin oh man my t-zone
obviously especially my nose and quite
oily and I suffer from really large
pores on my nose as well so I get quite
a few whiteheads and it kind of a bit
bumpy I hate my nose but I'm going to
confess and till I can you know resolve
these things there which is what I'm
working on then it's a bit of annoyance
but you know I don't mind telling you
guys the truth we've all got our
problems and that is my problem
zone I also suffer from
hyperpigmentation at times I've actually
got that down really really well but for
instance I pop one of these sounds so
gross guys don't be grossed out by me
I'm sorry but I like basically anything
that was going in and then I ended up
with this big black dot on the middle of
my nose and then I had like a couple of
black dots up there on the side and it
just doesn't look nice especially in the
summer they actually get darker and
that's why I do wear um sunscreen and
hat even though I've got darker skin so
that is my skin and I guys I'm going to
let you enjoy this and hopefully it
gives you a couple of tips and tricks so
guys this is my bare face some of you
guys have seen it before but here you go
take a good look and I'm just pointing
out some of the areas where I have some
hyperpigmentation and just where my
skin's a bit uneven as you can see it's
okay but it could always be a little bit
and there's the pesky mark I told you
about on my nose that's a key thing I
want to get rid of so for achieving
flawless even and poreless skin I
believe there are three different steps
so the first step to clear an even skin
is exfoliation and not necessarily by
the use of grains and things that
scratch the skin but using chemicals
such as a hay chaise and BHA for example
this product has glycolic acid the
products like these actually break down
the top layer of dead skin cells and
help to resurface new fresh bright
glowing skin if you have problems with
pores or wrinkles this really will help
deal with it these are a great
alternative to scrubs and mitts that can
sometimes break and damage the skin I
let that sit in my face for about five
minutes and then I rinse it so after
exfoliation the next step is to treat
and when I say treat I basically mean to
lighten my dark marks and even out my
skin tone and yes all I use is a humble
lemon because of the power of vitamin C
so you can either rub the lemon directly
onto the dark marks onto your face or
you can put it on something like a
tissue pad or a cotton wall bud so
basically you rub that on everywhere
it's great for evening out my skin tone
I must say that it does sting a tad
especially if you've had some open spots
as you can tell by my face here so if it
is stinging dilute it with a bit more
water which is what I ended up doing so
you probably just need to let it sit for
about five minutes and rinse off if you
want to but you don't have to you can
actually leave it on
my next thing is to treat my paws and I
use a pore refining cream I will add I'm
not sponsored by any of these products
here to talk about them these are
products I genuinely like using but
what's valuable in this product is the
vitamin A which is really good for cell
regeneration and turnover so that really
helps in basically clearing out my skin
minimizing the sides of my pores because
it's clearer and I sometimes use it all
over just because it's a really good
product so after exfoliating and
treating the final step is to protect
your skin by using moisturizers and
sunblock
so I've been using this moisturizer from
origins and it contains SPF up to 25
which means that it protects my skin
enough from the Sun and means that you
know my marks won't keep getting darker
and my skin will stay even so while our
that's we've done that is my three steps
which is exfoliating treating and
protecting so guys I hope you enjoyed
that video before you click off I wanted
to tell you about a website called
Opinion Outpost it's a website where you
can actually get rewarded for sharing
your opinions so their companies and
brands who want your opinions on
products just how I gave my opinion on
some of the stuff I use they want your
opinions and if you do give your
opinions you get rewarded you get gift
vouchers and they even do a ten thousand
dollar giveaway every quarter so I'm
going to put a link in the description
bar below so you guys can definitely
check that out if you want to mix image
clash or if you want to get some rewards
I would definitely recommend doing that
and it actually makes a difference so
