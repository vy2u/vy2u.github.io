treated like a bombshell brown bar on
chocolate because we've got brown on
brown on brown on brown right now and
this video is sponsored by nice and easy
by claire roll because that's exactly
what i use to create this look today i'm
going to make that me show you how i
dyed my hair at home myself and i'm
really proud of myself because it's been
a long time that attempted dieting or
anything and actually i had a video
where i did it before and i did like one
half and half my hair look like a crispy
ginger something or the other
and at that point in time i've been no
patricia I'm not going to wear color so
I've been quite a diverse oven in my
head like a quite a harsh ombre that I
was like you know what this is all too
bright for me so I basically decided to
take the on right here I had and then
change it up and create this look it's
one step and it's so easy to do I use
the nice and easy color enhancers these
are non permanent that come out in
between 6 to 8 washes there's no ammonia
no peroxide and they've got a pH of
between 8 &amp;amp; 9 which makes them very mild
so you can use them on natural or lactic
or we like aidid and there are nine
different shades so it's all kind of
brown blonde and these are really
affordable you can find them action for
drugs so yeah I'll have everything
linked in the description bar below by
the meantime enjoy this video and I
haven't done as always to like tutorial
like this for so love but I'm going to
be doing so much more eye and eye color
go I'm here like you all be seeing me
and but I care anymore maybe I don't
was it will see any guys I will catch
you later thank so the color I started
out with was quite a harsh ombre so I
had a half dark and half light hair
color and I wanted to get rid of that so
I started off first are ditching my hair
now to get this brown you do not need to
do this but because I wanted to get rid
of the harsh color I had I needed to
bleach the top of my hair to kind of
combine the two and it's also great to
allow the lighter colors to pop through
a little bit more so I basically make
developer
along with bleach and I used an
aluminium foil and of course a brush to
apply the bleach I basically just mix
these into a nonmetallic Bowl together
along with the bleach powder and that is
what it takes to basically put these
onto my hair so I focus on the areas
that were black just to basically get
rid of that harsh gradient and also I
wanted to kind of create a value yard
but I wasn't that successful at doing
that I also use the foil to kind of help
it to set but I found that this bleach
very very quickly I think it's because I
put quite a lot of bleach powder in
there and then I basically took this wig
off and put it on a stand and just went
all the way in again the key thing I
wanted to do was just get rid of the
harsh lines and differences so I checked
to see if it had lightened and it
lightened quite quickly about 25 minutes
and I focused on just in the fat area as
well I didn't really rough but it lights
in real quick which is quite surprising
and then I went ahead and I just rinsed
that in the sink rich all the bleach off
and yeah that was at the very end of it
being done so I let that dry and just
combed it out and then what you'll see
is that I ended up with hair that looked
slightly kind of ginger ish and it was
quite crazy but it's fine because I knew
I was going to add the brown on top so
this is the range of the color enhancers
from that nice and easy the color
collection is really good and really
natural they have a great pH of between
eight and nine which is very gentle on
the hair
there's no ammonia and no bleach in it
so you can use it on your natural all
your relaxed hair also there are nine
shade so I went ahead and focus on the
ends of my hair first because they were
delighted and I really wanted them to be
a dark as possible and
so that the head didn't look too harsh
the applicator bottle was so easy I just
basically squeezed it and I thought
there wouldn't be enough to cover my
whole head but honestly there was so
much so after this it got a good rinse
out and I came back and basically I
start like my hair was literally black
but I know that my hair can often look
darker until it's like blow-dried out a
goat went ahead and used my blow
dryer to dry it out and see what it
looked like and as you can see where I
had bleach the Brown had really taken
quite a lot and I actually like the
color of it I ended up getting here I
basically blow-dried it and left it
until the next day to curl it at this
point in time I was quite tired but as
you can see this is what the color looks
like so once I held it and everything
you can see what it looks like
I love salutely love the color so easy
to do literally it's just one step I
decided to just you know bleach as well
very natural gentle on the hair and I
love the results so if you guys ever
want to try it please you check out my
link in the description bar below if you
want to know anything else I'll be
