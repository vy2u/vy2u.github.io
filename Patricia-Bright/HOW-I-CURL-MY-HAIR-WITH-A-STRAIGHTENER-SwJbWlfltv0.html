tutorial today it's been so long since
I've done a hair tutorial because I got
really lazy with my hand you might
notice that I often wear the same kind
of hairstyle but I whipped out my old
Remington curling wand this Remington
curling wand here and it just gave me
these really nice flirtatious clothes
and this is all I used alongside my
lawyer Yale of extraordinary wheel which
is great as a heat protector and just
some edge control because my hair is a
little bit my own hair is a little bit
right now and that just really helps me
smooth my edges down but guys this is it
what do you think if you guys want to
see more hair tutorials their new
comments and below and I really want to
try and just do more with my hair
because I've been wearing the same
hairstyle for coming on to you so go
first of all I'm just going to show you
basically what my weave looks like and I
do au pot later on in the video I'm
going to show you exactly how I blend in
my real hair with the weave and you'll
notice my hair really isn't that
straight because I actually only relax
my hair once every four months so in the
meantime I would potentially use a
straightener or flat side of a coiling
tom just move up my edges slightly and I
only do this once every two weeks also
just to kind of protect my hair
so moving on to making the coils it's
all about grabbing a smaller last
section and getting the one correct me
and just holding it for long enough to
get the right curls so what you'll see
here is that I'm really focused on
keeping the hair that I grabbed quite
small and flat while I'm turning it
because this will give me the better
curl and I leave it on for about four or
five seconds and let it go and I find
that the more I do it the better they
get usually the first ones terrible but
you'll see it's kind of keeping the hair
flat and a twisting motion you'll see
that car looks a lot tighter so I just
move on and carry on doing this around
my hair sometimes I try to make sure I
hold it on just long enough because you
can let go too early and you just won't
maintain the curls
though all around my head and I tried to
focus a bit more at the crown so I can
get a bit of volume because it can look
a bit flat at times but I don't like
Kara is too too big so guys this is the
finish curls and I really like the way
it looks and I do split them apart from
low volume now I'm just going to show
you how I do might leave out I part it
into a few sections and I would just use
the flat side of the curling wand to
basically smooth it out as you can see
that my hair is a different texture to
the weave
for the curly hair I just add a little
color flick to help it kind of blend in
to the hair snake extensions a lot
better you can see that I just smooth it
down it blends a lot better and then I
just curl it at the end
so just to tie everything in I use like
a sleek and shine product it's kind of
like gel but not gel and I just put that
all around my edges and use the slick
brush again to kind of smooth it all out
and just to blend it all in and that's
my finished curly hair look I hope you
enjoyed that tutorial and it gives you a
few ideas and maybe helps if you want to
do the same thing so guys thanks for
watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
