this in your ever in your Thai life ever
don't do it I love you look people
working to my channel I hope you are
doing well I know I've got a bit of a
different look going on today don't I
and the hair they had people I bought
this wig on Amazon to remind me of what
I look like in the 90s and today we're
about to take it back I'm gonna show you
how I did my hair and my makeup I did my
hair and my makeup in school like back
in the day when I was young and
beautiful but yeah let's just go with
that if you're not subscribed subscribe
and you can follow me on my social is
what I'm doing those giveaways I want
you guys to be proactive interactive and
I will be DMing people okay right let's
get into this video the honest truth is
I was not allowed to wear makeup as a
kid it's it's different I know nowadays
it's completely different right there
was no oh mom I'm just putting on my
makeup
there was nice there's none of that
there was petroleum jelly or there was
Palmas cocoa butter or there was
Vaseline and that is it so I left for
school and I wasn't moisturized i
glistened like the utter sun and now
that's like not really to my skin kind
of stuff I cannot believe that my life
was basically rubbing Vaseline on my
face oh that you know what you know you
never would dry oh my god look at the
shine but I always had their baby
Vaseline like this is like the African
version of the baby Vaseline it was had
quite a nice now so when I left the
house I look like this right my mom
going to school what what I did do was
my hair so I spent a lot of time kind of
gelling down my edges and the gel I used
to use was called Jam gel or there was
this gel here which I actually still use
it's a nice firm hold in gel and I would
spend a lot of time just chilling down
the baby head
come rain or shine my edges had to be
babied all the way down how your baby
has looked was almost like your social
status like if you had good baby hairs
you were good Tom my gosh look at that
yes you see that wiggle that was the
sign of you took time look at the grease
look like a moon I'm reflecting like a
mirror the more cocoa butter we you
smell you know you're eating you know
you're coming from a good home you know
if you look dry your struggle was real
it's so funny you don't belong I make
sure that my daughter is moisturize that
I'm not no no your face that's dry like
she's always moisturize he's so shiny
yeah someone leaving home this is what I
look like enemy we create the whole
thing I used to wear a shirt and a
jumper okay my jumper was a bright red I
didn't have a jumper just like this but
I couldn't find myself a red sweatshirt
I would leave the house with my button
all the way up like this
ed knows right I just put your poor
Patricia she was just challenged oh now
here's the good part now when I left the
house it was time to get a little bit
creative and still some of mom's makeup
and put it in my bag with me but I
didn't know about eyebrows or anything
like that so what I would do is I would
put on literally compact powder
foundation it would be my mum's it would
be like Iman or something like that
old-fashioned fair my mommy sees a lot
of fashion fair and it's like you know
compact like this this is why I said
this is actually quite good but there
was no foundation there was nothing it
was just powered I like just gray powder
and I'm Hannah so I didn't do this a lot
you know I tell people I was a really
late bloomer when it came to makeup I
didn't really wear makeup oh Lord I look
like a ghost I didn't really wear makeup
till I was um you know 21 like properly
properly but you know I'm the powder
girl I put powder on that my mom didn't
know about
taught me pretty sure that this isn't
how you went out and if you were fancy
you have like a gold chain we didn't
have money like that so I definitely
didn't have a cold gold chain but used
to wear a little tight wear it like
slightly hanging a little bit lower you
know like if you were retired to school
you never wore your tie all the way up
to the top you were like hanging you
know just just down there I look
particularly ghost-like
but of course the the lips would be
Vasily how can you just go in with
powder foundation raw so next up and the
thing that was really popular I don't
have the exact one but it was the berry
em and they had like glitter liner and
all the girls in my school like it was
just thing everyone wore the glitter
miners do you guys remember the berry em
like the glitter liners they were the
it's like every girl had it I used to
draw the longest it was almost like a
winged line up but without before I knew
what winged liner was everyone that
would be blinking with just like this
silver is silver color on that eye I was
just to go with the flow kind of person
I feel like I have a story to tell you
guys I remember so I had me and a friend
right she was quite bad and I remember
me since I never used to I was a really
good girl
I didn't I didn't hook up with any guys
no guys fancied me especially what I
don't like this it's but my friend was
really beautiful and guys always liked
her I like I remember like you know
would get ready to get up to basically
bunk school do not bunk school to meet
guys do not ever do this in your ever in
your Thai life ever I don't do it I'm
like I remember she used to wear like
this silver eyeliner and she used to
look so good and I've got hopefully if I
will see silver eyeliner I'd look like
her and you know maybe guys would like
me no definitely not
no guy hates me probably because my eyes
look florescent my eyebrows were a dusty
eyebrows were not really something you
know that were a consideration so what I
ended up with was a relatively strong
narrow line so what I'll be honest in
saying is that my makeup in school was
realistically quite a hot mess I know
today that the makeup looks phenomenal
well you guys worried but no when I was
in school I was not set up that way
the other thing that was really really
important was mascara and the mascara
that I first used I was fancy it was my
mom's discover it was the YSL false lash
effect mascara it was an expensive
mascara and I would just snatch my mom's
one like it was mine but it made my
lashes look so good mascara is the one
thing that people did not skimp on oh
and eyeliner black eyeliner I used to
basically go to like the cheap her
beauty supply store and just pick up the
eyeliners there they were like 99p and
on my lips it would definitely be
something very M quite glossy or
translucent E or almost iridescent so
something like this and have been up my
street this is actually super nice my
makeup got a little bit different as I
got like a little bit older when I was
like 16 17 hi boy now the way that you
know the look had to be topped up had to
be the door knocker earrings trust me I
would save up for Christmas and get them
from the algaas catalog the Archos
catalog was a little bit like a Bible as
I during Christmas I would look at all
the necklaces that I wanted and if I
could get my neck P crystal necklace or
get my door knocker earrings there we go
that put the look together that is what
was nice
hey break it down oh just look at that
line look at that line or that powder
foundation my gel is not living we need
to reach out to Dawa I don't know what
it is this the earrings they put the
whole look together
alright I'm actually living for it I
know that when I started to upgrade my
style a little bit what came in with was
the black liner like the black lip my
knot was a thing and the gold lipstick
that's when you really you really you
really were on it and I used to put so
much gel in my hair that used to have
like white crispy flakes but with the
black liner you want it to be careful
you don't want it to be so black that
you know you look like you had a beard
well I definitely would have looked like
I had a beard I couldn't have done this
maybe I used dark brown the black is
just too much the black is too strong
yeah gold the kylie is actually the
perfect gold like I used to wear it
wasn't ever we've ruined it it was never
this bad it was never this bad yeah
Trisha okay hold on let's just adjust
this hair I could never have left my
house like this my mom would have
actually gone nuts put on the bus this
was me okay I was never this bad could i
I feel like I brought everything
together I did couldn't cuz it it's
really a lot as a very sweet girl and
very well behaved it's good Cisco song
song was my anthem Cisco was my hero
it was my crush with his silver hair and
we'd have like one headphone one
earpiece in on her I would have a CD
player and would play that album and
that would be careful because if if you
moved it the song would skip and then
look I know
ah that was so good oh my god TLC no
scrubs I couldn't even get a scrub even
if I wanted to it decided that if you're
going to do a black liner you got to do
it with your chest keep it real the
intensity was very real
well well guys that is it that is how I
did my makeup in school and I'm really
reflecting as to what I was thinking the
black liner and the gold nib I don't
know minded like dazzle the dazzle
glitter thing but it's just it's the
lift
it's just huh anyway at least this is
the reason I didn't have any boyfriends
in school and I got good grades I went
to university and graduated and now I'm
the success because I was ugly i I'm
just I'm just really shocked to see this
like black line and gold lip was a thing
but you know we don't have a lot of
money but we still wanted to be fry
we've a little unclear as and are
dazzled if it was called dazzle dodge
seems like dazzle dust in pot and there
was good liners it was insane you had a
slip thank you brandy Moishe for making
us feel like we could wear gray okay
guys and I feel like the petroleum jelly
is sinking into my skin right now and
that I'm just going to just wash my face
off intensity and just look human again
but you know it's brightness I wanted to
have a little bit of fun and do videos
that you guys can enjoy and I like to
poke fun at myself anyway and this was
my reality and I wonder why I had so
many issues like growing up like
seriously butcher shop but yeah that's
it guys thank you for watching give it a
thumbs up if you liked seeing videos
like this there's any one thing else you
want to see let me know but in the
meantime I'll catch you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
