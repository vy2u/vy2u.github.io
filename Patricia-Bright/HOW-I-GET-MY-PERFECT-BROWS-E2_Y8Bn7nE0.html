the moment and I don't think it's just
the faces that I'm pulling in this video
can you tell what's missing just have a
little closer look I'm sure you can see
that basically my eyebrows are not
filled in I have a full face of makeup
and yes no eyebrows doesn't look good so
I'm going to show you exactly how I
basically do my eyebrows and they're a
great way to frame your face and they
show your beauty so I'm gonna do this
video and I hope you enjoy so for those
of you who have fine brows like me
filling them in is basically a godsend
you can transform your face with a thin
liner like I'm using here this is one
technique and basically it makes you
look like you have brows all you need to
do are short shot lines that resemble
hairs and just follow the shape of your
natural brow as spoolie is great to just
blend that all out brush any hairs that
are bit out of place and just smooth it
all down
so the next step is basically imperative
if you've not been to the selim for a
while and your eyebrows are looking a
little bit rough and when you use a
concealer it basically meetin's
everything up and I try not to go too
light I know a lot of girls like the
really light concealer look but I don't
know you just look confused in my
opinion so I basically just do it with a
concealer probably about you know my
shade or a little bit lighter and I
simply blend it out with my fingers and
I hope there aren't any harsh lines so
for those hard core perfected brows
sometimes I will use a brow mascara I
love this one by by Terry the color is
absolutely perfect and it really just
slicks to my eyebrows down perfectly so
easy peasy that's how I do my brows so
I'm gonna go ahead and just show you the
rest of the look I'm just starting off
with misting my face with the chordally
beauty elixir and a little bit of
moisturizer today I'm not using the
l'oreal true match foundation which I
quite like in the winter it's a little
bit dry but it will do so I'm using my
favorite concealer it is the Kevin and
Kwan skin enhancer and I'm just setting
with some powder I'm going to use my
sleek contour kit it is my lifesaver and
then I'm actually gonna use a by Terry
it's a cream blush and I just love this
blush it's so pretty
moving on to my eyes I'm using NARS it's
a Punnett called the Tsuburaya and it's
basically some Browns little bit of gold
and then I'm adding egg chocolate in the
crease as well I love to wing the eyes
out for me they're great framing I look
especially when I look brothers like I
do here so next I just add a touch of
mascara and some eyeliner and I'm
basically good to go when it comes to
the eyes the liner that I'm using is by
Mac it is called Burgundy and I'm just
gonna use the trusty Ruby woo which is
always gonna be my favorite red for the
moment and I'm just putting a bit of
gloss on top of that as well so guys
that's a really quick Beauty basic and
you can really see how brows can
transform your face a little tip if any
of you are struggling with thinner
eyebrows you can actually try castor oil
in the evening it's great if you want to
grow your eyebrows out so I hope you
enjoyed and I'll see you guys later
thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
