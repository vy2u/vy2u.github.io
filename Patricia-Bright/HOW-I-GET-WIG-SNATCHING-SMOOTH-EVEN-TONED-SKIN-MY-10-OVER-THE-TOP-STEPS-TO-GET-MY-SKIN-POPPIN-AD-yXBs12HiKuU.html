line no cakes were eaten hello beautiful
people welcome back to my channel I hope
you are doing well I know I sound as
crusty as a bag of nails right about now
it's the dry California air it's doing
something to me and I know that I look
like a greasy hot mess but this is the
reality of my face at the end of the day
especially when it's been hot and sweaty
and so what about to just go through the
whole process of taking myself from this
to even more fantastic because I still
feel like I look amazing
without my makeup on and so many of you
guys have been asking about skincare
skin or skin burn so I'm gonna share
everything right about now and you know
what I've been needing a little bit of
me time right about now so we're just
gonna do this together and I can
honestly tell you that just snatching
these babies off is like taking off a
bra on a hot day do you ever feel like
that
yeah so get comfortable get a cup of tea
place in the evening just get
comfortable at Kay lovelies first thing
I've got to do has to be the lash snatch
and I've had a quite dramatic makeup on
recently but that's because I felt like
it and listen this wig bad boy is gonna
be staying on til tomorrow so I'm just
gonna put on my my little headband so
you know this is the preparation to
having a good night sleep is doing a
very good nighttime routine so I don't
know if you guys know that I had a
little interruption at Sephora and ever
since then I felt like my face was just
like no but no baby no sweetie we're not
gonna do that again it was actually not
even a joke I had like an allergic
reaction to something I put on my lips
my eye hurts um it was it's been a hot
mess so I'm really like really on my
skincare right now I'm gonna go ahead
use my Clinique take the day off balm if
you don't know about this to be honest I
thought that everybody knew about this
but there are some people out here who
don't
listen this is my favorite bomb when it
comes to removing my makeup I have
partnered with them I don't even know
why they partners with me cuz I talk
about this all the time but hey they did
and I love this product what I love
about their cleansing balm is how it
just it's like it just eats away at my
makeup and it just takes everything off
like look at the drama it snatches
everything off right and then it doesn't
leave my face oily feeling or dry
feeling like I don't know how that works
but it works it's non greasy non-drying
and for me I love a cleansing balm to
get rid of all the residue that is on my
face just watch this listen if you got
painted on eyebrows I'm telling you it
will come all the way off I feel so good
feels oh good then I go ahead my coffee
is wet normally I can't see I can't see
no I'm gonna do this over my sink with
one fell swoop look and this is the
cleansing top which works so well ah you
feel so good it feels so good so good
honey's so that is me without any makeup
on I have to put something on my lips
Claire do you want to come up here being
all ashy for you guys it's too much so
after my bone cleanse there are times
where I just go to bed I'm like I'm done
with we're done just do the fog cleanse
don't even put on any night moisturizer
sometimes sometimes but tonight I'm like
you know what there's levels to this I
need to feel good I need to vote fresh
in the morning so I'm gonna go in with
my cleanser is this won't be a skin
clinic she's actually dumped ologist in
London
go to her once in a while for facials or
for some treatments it says it basically
a glycolic acid cleanser it's a really
good I use glycolic acid all the time
use this with my facial brush Bob's your
uncle this is my cleansing step so now
my skin is cleansed in this unravel like
it is nice and smooth honey it's smooth
as you can see literally nothing on my
towel besides a little bit
skaara only a little bit of mascara and
children is why I just did is really bad
sometimes you should just let your face
air dry you don't need to be all tower
drain and all that ish but I did that
today listen in all honesty my eyes can
be dry they can be ashy all right around
here right around here I just have dry
eyelid areas and like I've got a little
light look but I don't know it's my eye
shape you know we've all got our own eye
shapes my eye shape has this little just
this permanent bag just a little one
it's cute right but now it's getting a
little bit you know it's trying to catch
a few lines down there so we're using
eye cream we're being being cautious and
I feel like I started my eye cream game
late so if you can start your eye cream
game early start it early and being
fancy I'm using lemare eye concentrate
really really nice I can't lie I really
like it there was actually another one I
was using for my brand and I swear to
memorize worse while my eyes looking
like this at skin they're so itchy I
think it was just too strong I think had
a little bit of retinol in it like
really really little but my skin wasn't
ready so we're just gonna go with in the
MER now I'm gonna put it out there I am
a certified product junkie and when it
comes to my skincare I like a lot of it
I like a lot of it i layer that bad boy
up I probably use about 4 serums if I do
my Clinique take the day off balm I use
a facial wash and facial brush use an
eye cream then I go ahead and use like
serum 1 which is normally something
vitamin C related there are so many good
vitamin C brands out there that you know
I use d CL which is kind of expensive
but I've also used the ordinary even its
unique of this really cool like vitamin
booster that you can use in the day but
I actually like to use Whitman sea at
night as well the one that uses super
high potency so it kind of stings it
kind of things
I feel like eventually your fin your
skin gets used to it
well it burn it burn right there oh but
I still like it you know sometimes
there's something burns your night or
like that so after that hyaluronic
hyaluronic hyaluronic hyaluronic good
quality hyaluronic I will list in the
description bar some of my favorite
hyaluronic products because you can buy
pricey ones that don't do anything they
can buy it more affordable ones that are
amazing my hyaluronic is also from PCL
but I also like to mix that with
Clinique Moisture search as you can see
I'm running out of it this oh no no this
contains a lot of hyaluronic acid in it
and it just gives your skin that balance
because what it does is it draws in
moisture if you are actually you know
not gonna be actually oh and you know I
do now I look after my hands we're just
gonna rub all of that expensive product
into that and onto my face look after
your hands ladies I've always had which
you grab my hands but no when I do look
after them at night they're kind of cute
they need love as well you know you see
that hyaluronic push that into the skin
you're about to serve some secret a
secret that was shared with me that I'm
going to share with you and it's all
about facial massage in listen I think
this is a wives tale to that I've met a
woman whose face was so plump it was a
peach it was a peat and she's like she
manages her face every single night and
I actually got this recently
it's from booth sharp it's a facial
massage plate and you just use it to
massage your face listen I'm extra some
days you gotta be extra yes you'll find
me in my bed massaging my jawline ask me
a question why am i doing that to be
beautiful to be beautiful I snatch that
jawline no cakes were eaten and they
about massaging it basically stimulates
blood flow to your face in a way that
you don't normally stimulate back to the
flow to your face and it's a really
really good for your skin but feel so
doing like right here oh I'm tired now
I'm ready for a bit
so I thought that my massage it's time
to go in with another serum for me I
like to use sins that are soothing or
calming one that I love from Lancome it
is really good for sensitive skin oh so
for me I basically do three layers of
serums and then I finally go in with a
night oil any natural oil argan oil and
night oil it really doesn't matter which
oil just a light well not anything
that's too heavy or going to crumble
skin I feel like just using an oil like
seals are all in I like Slick Rick when
I go to bed at night next to my husband
but you know I'm beautiful you love me
and I will never be ashy and I will stay
youthful so accepted me oily face and
all and on my lips I use pet star also
film Clinique this is a bad boy bad boy
if your lips are struggling and there
you have it guys this is what I'd be
looking like in the middle of the night
shiny but refresh my face almost tingles
like after the mask alert of the serums
after the cleansers and I'm not going to
see her and say that I do this every
night but I probably do it every other
night and I always use my can take the
day off balm to get all my makeup off
because that's important
I'm very very rarely if not ever use
face wipes sometimes I use baby wipes
sometimes like it depends on the day
sometimes that you use them but that's
it guys I know so many of you guys have
been wanting to know my skincare routine
I don't know if that's dramatic or not
so let me know it's basically to claims
is a facial brush vitamin C hyaluronic
acid a massage
another serum and then a facial oil
eight and lip and eye cream all 10:10
step my 10 step nighttime routine but
you know ten steps to sing homeless and
beautiful and soberness the more
comfortable with my skin the better I
feel and I feel more comfortable and I
am not wearing makeup but I can walk
down the street and be like hey although
