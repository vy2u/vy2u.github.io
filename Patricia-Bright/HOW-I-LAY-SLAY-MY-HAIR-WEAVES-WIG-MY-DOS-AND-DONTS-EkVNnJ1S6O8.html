sure you're looking at me and looking at
my hair and noticing that it looks very
different to normal I have now got in Y
Splash which is our new collection of
colored hair which is basically kind of
hombres and Belliard use for the girl
who struggles to get that perfect color
and just what it already done and
doesn't want the long-winded nurse or
the awkwardness of going to have Silas
and get in a color that you just really
don't like so this is one of the colors
from our collection which I absolutely
love and today I wanted to do a video
and basically kind of an update on how I
like lay and slay my wheeze and then
some of my favorite do's and don'ts
because I feel like I always get
questioned on my hair and what I do to
kind of achieve a really natural look
with my wigs and my weeds and I kind of
just wanted to show off my new cut that
and I wanted to let you guys know and
about an event that I am doing myself

of how many people are coming but the
two
not expensive but with actually already
sold out on the early bird tickets and
I'm excited our new collection is
absolutely amazing why splash we've got
Cutler in the house you can see in the
flesh and yeah you can see my level of
excitement okay so guys I'm going to go
ahead and show you exactly what I do to
kind of create this look and it's kind
of a couple of do's and don'ts that I do
when it comes to laying and slaying my
leaves and my wigs anyway so guys I hope
you enjoy and thanks for watching
bye so here I am starting out with my
real hair and I basically wear my hair
under my wigs just in a ponytail now my
hair is really like fine anyway so if
you've got really thick or really long
hair it might be hard for you to do that
you might be better off braiding it but
for me it's very easy for me just to put
my hair in a ponytail I'm kind of
dealing with some hair with shoes post
baby but I'm kind of on the recovery
right now I'm going to do a actual
natural hair tutorial to show you guys
what I actually do with my hair how I
get my hair like this from like my
throat and stuff like that and how I've
been looking after my eggs I've been
doing lots of different things to really
kind of help improve it because it
postpartum shedding is a genuinely real
thing and my hair was just disappearing
on me I but know like my edges were just
crying off it was not a joke but they've
got a lot better now so the next really
important thing I think you have to do
is to make sure you wear a cat under
your wig and I just wear a is like a
nylon cat like tights basically and the
reason I think it's really important is
it kind of gives your wig something to
stick to and it also protects your like
edges because when you have a week just
rubbing on your edges more than likely
you're going to get a lot of breakage in
the long term and I know it's a lot of
girls are quite thin hair lines and you
know I don't have enough hair lines to
be just wasting it away to wigs but know
I always wear a dome cap and it makes a
lot of a difference to me so next is
when it comes to wig making I don't make
my wigs I'm going to be honest with you
and I can make wig
I can make unit I can do it but it just
takes a long time and I'm a busy woman
so I would rather go to people that I
trust to do it and I've got quite a few
hairstylist that I'd go to that I really
like like Marie's like boys on my hair
Marvin's done my hair and I go to
radiance hair salon as well so this time
I went to Radia to do this unit for me
and normally I have two to three bundles
in the back and then a frontal that's
why I would always wear and for this you
know this specific one it was two to
three bundles of the splash collection
as well as the frontal from the plastic
collection and what they normally do is
they make it on a net wig I had I think
it's Risa who made my wig for me
they make it on a neck net with calf and
then they just kind of sew the tracks on
in the way that you would sew or weave
onto a cap which is why I really prefer
having my wigs made then buying these
wigs because I like the shape that you
get with a wig on a cap like this and
then they bleach the frontal for me and
they also pluck it to make it look more
realistic and I think cracking is really
essential like if it's not flat and it
is not bleach it's not going to be right
but you're gonna do it yourself be
really careful because you can end up
with a frontal or a way that looks bored
and it's not a good look like it's just
not a good look
so when it comes to putting on my wig
there are a couple of different ways
that I like to do it so my lazy girl way
to put on a wig or uni is to basically
bring out the front of my hairline and
then kind of flip it back over my hair
and then with my frontal I'd kind of
fold it to make it a bit flatter because
this is really quite thin at the front
and then I would bring it like all the
way up close to the front of my hairline
and then I would kind of flip my hair
over it now this isn't a great look to
wear if you want to wear like a a dead
set parting or something like that not
on it's not good and honestly though
that takes about six seconds to do
forgot about how good this is it is a
hairstyle like I love it it's so easy
now next when it come
- really laying my hair is really
important to lay it properly a lot of
women just kind of take their wig out of
the box or they get their frontal and
they plunk it on and it's just
straight-up just wrong like just random
the King hair line looking like no just
auntie no just don't do it shouldn't be
done ever and I've got a really small
forehead and quite four forward hairline
so I've got to really wear mine right at
my hairline to look as natural as
possible what I also like to do is to
flatten it so if I know I'm going to
have a part in using straighteners I
will just flatten the hair at the lace
because that will make it look really
seamless and really natural and again if
you're going to do this don't hold it on
for too long
because you will burn your legs and then
boy we'll just have a big fat hole in
the middle of your lace and that's not a
good look just go like that I'm not
going to like back in the day I used to
hate lace frontals and lace wigs I just
thought they look really ugly and stuff
but they've come a long way and might I
say we sell very good ones that look
really good and really natural I could
kind of go just like this now we don't
do that but as you can see it looks
quite flat quite natural and that's
obviously because I'm wearing a front or
my hairs really flat underneath and then
obviously what a lot of girls do is
views we've got to be gel and I used to
use the other gel the white gel but I
found the clear gel and I patted buy
this on Amazon and I find that this has
got just as good a hold as the other gel
but it doesn't need the white residue
and a definite don't is to kind of have
you know white all over your front
hairline and what I do is I kind of just
put the glue not the glue the gel just
around the very front of my entire
hairline and the good thing is this is
just gel so with a little bit of oil or
moisturizer or water it comes right off
but it will give you really nice hold on
your frontal so I'm just going to put
that
there
and it's like really good hold without
the whiteness and you don't have to
overkill like on baby hairs however
because I like them I'm going to just do
a little bit and what I always do is I
kind of try to just use a headband or
something to kind of set my edges and to
set it so it doesn't kind of stick up
and it just hops there the gel dry and
then I can go ahead and style
but and now I'm going to go ahead and do
the styling I'm just gonna add some
loose wave
so guys that is my finished look this is
how I lay and slay my wheeze and some of
my kind of favorite do's and don'ts when
it comes to wearing frontals and wigs
and stuff like that changing up my look
is like part of the thing that I do plus
I've always change up my hair like it's
my favorite thing in the world to do
which is why I started why here anyway
but yeah I really like this look I've
been very glamorous I'm loving color
like I feel like this is just an awesome
color for autumn and I don't think I'm
everything to go back to black hair see
you in two weeks I have no way I would
change I automatically but I might add a
bit of red at some point in time I think
that's what I'm going to do next so guys
thanks for watching and I'll see you
later hey guys welcome to my channel
today's video is a little bit different
because I wanted to talk on something
that's been affecting me recently and</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
