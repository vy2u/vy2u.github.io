tutorial for you and I'm sure lots of
you guys have noticed that I have been
wearing wavy hair which is kind of like
bushy wavy curly hair and I've been
loving it I really feel like I'm a
convert to like hair that's a bit more
voluptuous I've always worn really sneak
hair I don't have been so contained in
my life but I'm a convert to the curly
hair so I'm going to show you what I do
to kind of refresh it been wearing this
for probably about three weeks now it's
had one wash but there's ways to
basically kind of bring the life back to
these curls that potentially are looking
a bit sorrowful and just get it looking
nice and fresh again I'm going to give
you the details on the hair that I'm
wearing because I have been asked and
obviously this is different to what I
usually wear and it's the Brazilian body
way so it comes back in the natural wave
pattern basically basically like this
and I've only just called this a little
bit on the top here I've got 16 18 and
20 inches to basically give me layers I
didn't cut any layers into this hair at
all and this is kind of this is kind of
how long it is as well so that's that I
might even add color that's how brave
I'm feeling nowadays but I'm going to
show you what I do to get my hair
looking right so guys I hope you enjoy
it and I'll see you later so I'm going
to go ahead and use the black vanilla
collection from Carol's Daughter it's
really great for dry hair and obviously
would be great for hair extensions like
mine you can see that they're nice cars
but they just need a little bit of
refreshing so the first thing I'm going
to do is to go wash and I'm going to use
the hydrating conditioner and to
basically do this there is a sulfate
free shampoo in the collection but as my
hair is curly and I don't really feel
like it needs a proper wash but just a
car refresh I'm just going to apply the
conditioner run it through with my hands
on both sides and just get that right
through and try to focus on the ends I
then like combing through as well to
make sure the product is spread or
through my weave so next obviously I'm
gonna put on a shower cap and I'm
looking super cute well this basically
allows it to kind of penetrate the hair
might go and put a face mask on or
something but I usually do this for
about 10 or 15 minutes and then I will
rinse out and basically my hair feels so
much softer and smoother already and I
can't block my hair and try to keep it
laying flat so next you can see that my
hair kind of looks like it's not so wavy
or as curly but that's fine I'm going to
refresh those and I'm going to go ahead
and use the leave-in conditioner I love
it because it's so moisturizing and it
smells so sweet but then I just spray
that near to my roots and I also focus
on my ends as well and nobody wants dry
brittle leave out an edges so I give
them a spray so next I'm going to
blow-dry using my blow-dryer which I
actually bought in Tesco it was so cheap
but it's such a good blow dryer and I
just use the scrunching method I'm sure
you guys have seen this a lot of times
and I'm not adding any other product in
my hair besides that leave-in
conditioner because I don't want my hair
to look way down or greasy now it can
take a while to dry so it's nice to kind
of leave it to air dry for a little bit
and then blow-dry on a lower heat but I
was kind of rushing here
so you can see it's kind of partially
dryer and the volume increases and the
waves come back but then I'll just give
it a little bit more of a blitz but you
can see what it looks like partway
through but when there's a little bit
dryer I can see how much hair where I
want to apply does it look greasy or not
but I basically add the pure hair oil
which has got some great natural oils in
there and I just do this so I added
shine and to seal in the moisture so for
my leave out I do straighten them
probably once every two weeks I try not
to do it too regularly and I try to
always keep conditioning my hair but I
basically just straighten my edges which
is just around mice really small leave
out and at the very front of my head and
you know you got to get that part in
looking red and straight so I just part
it and then I'm just going to add a
little bit of gel on my edges just to
smooth those down if you've got baby
hairs or like me peppercorns can get
them nice and smooth so finally I add a
couple of curls to the top of my head as
well just help blend in the areas that
are a little bit looser and I just like
spread those up with my fingers my
head's not completely dry but I'm sure
they will dry out a little bit later
so guys that's how I add light back to
my wavy hair I love it it's perfect for
spring/summer and I can't wait to add a
little bit more so guys I hope you enjoy
and I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
