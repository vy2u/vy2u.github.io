you guys can see that I am in another
location and I feel like I have been
another location quite a lot recently
but that's definitely what has inspired
me to do this video today and I wanted
to talk all about holiday planning
saving and some of my favorite locations
to go to because if I have to be totally
honest of you my guilty pleasure is
traveling and everyone's got to pick
their poison my poison is going on the
plane and signing it out in some kind of
cultural location and so many of you
guys have watched me in the past year
and a half go to Barcelona to Portugal
to rushers and you always ask me where
how do I plan for my holidays what's my
key tips what's my favourite locations
and just the whole process so I'm going
to do that today and hopefully it's
going to be helpful to some of you guys
who would one day like to travel like I
do or just want to know you know how do
you go about planning it and stuff so
first things first you need to decide on
a budget and the budget is all going to
be dependent on how much one you have in
your bank at that point in time if
you've got 100 pounds then ideally
you're not going to do that but I
wouldn't ever advise going you know away
on credit or work by not having the cash
but if you save up for it so I always
say that from
holidays may actually have like a
holiday Kitty so I put a certain amount
every month into a pot where I know that
that is literally just for vacation
because that is my thing so I have to
save up to go away on holiday and you
know anyone can set their budget you
could put 50 pounds per month and then
you might see that Oh at the end of a
year you've got oh what's my mathematics
like 600 pounds there at the end of the
year and that could be decent to go to
like a short break holiday so literally
you need to consider your budget
first and foremost so once you've got a
significant amount of money aside what
you want to do is begin researching and
I always trust my friends and my family
so where they travel to and what have
they liked about the location there are
also lots of bloggers even people like
myself where I've gone to and their
travel blog and you work out what kind
of holiday that you want so you might
want a city break so New York London and
Barcelona these are all City breaks and
you can decide if that's the kind of
thing you want you might want a beach
getaway where there's lots of tourists
and lots of people lots of drinking or
you might want to go on a cultural
experience so you kind of determine what
it is that you want and then that can
kind of pick what location you go to so
next you want to now look for your
flights and I wouldn't go with one
flight person or one airline I always
use the website called sky scanner and I
find that it gives you an idea of all
the different flights that are out there
and it compares them and you can decide
which airline you want to go with and
your prices will fluctuate you can also
make savings by going indirect so
instead like when I went to where do I
go to Singapore I ended up stopping off
in Dubai and then from do bar I got a
Malaysian Airways
or something like that and those are
quick ways you can make some savings
there are also things like flight center
in the UK I used to write Center a lot I
call them up and say look I want it
really cheap right this is the location
I want to go to and also do this in
advance I try and do this like three
four months in advance I never get it
three four months in advance usually but
two months in advance is definitely the
way to go if you want to make some great
savings on your tickets so the next is
the bit that I enjoy which is picking
the hotel picking our hotel takes the
longest amount of time but it's so so so
important like you can have a horrible
holiday if you're in the horrible hotel
where you just don't feel comfortable
and again I use TripAdvisor that is one
of the best ones football it's the best
I think
and also bookings calm in terms of
picking the hotel what I do is I filter
one by star rating to buy price and then
I also filter by comments and how
customers have rated it and then I read
through all the comments and then I
sometimes people will moan about a hotel
and say oh it's really far you can't
walk into town but if walking into town
isn't important for me and it's
everything else is amazing I might go
for that hotel because I actually like
walking if you want to like literally
jump into the center of town then it
might not be for you but I don't mind
getting on the train going in taking
15-20 minutes to travel I like it
commute but it's not for everyone so
just read the reviews and you know
sometimes you're going to get past the
anger some people have had a bad
experience and they get really angry
about it and can't be objective so try
and see through that and look at all the
other reviews once you've decided on
your location you've got your tickets
and you have got your hotel booked you
want to reach out to anyone that you
know who's there or has been there
before who or who may know people out
there because what you want to do is
begin saving you also want to find out
what's the best things to do what's the
best places to eat what's the key things
that you've got to see
and the locals are always best like they
are more likely to know and also your
hotels may be really good at advising
you but if you want to go off the beaten
track it's all about speaking to people
reaching out and just asking your
friends which is what I love doing when
I go away so next this is because I'm
cheesy I actually write an itinerary and
what I do is I basically determine what
are the key things that I want to see in
this location or what I want to do so
being in New York was the Statue of
Liberty something that I wanted to see
no but I knew that I definitely wanted
to go to the Metropolitan Museum of
Modern Art so I made it a priority on
day two to make sure that I visit there
so I have a map and I literally to tick
off every single thing that I want to do
in a particular region when I am away
and you know I enjoy that means that I
don't miss out what anything that I
actually want to see so guys I hope you
enjoyed that video and it gave you a
couple of tips and trips on holiday
planning and I'd love to know like what
your favorite destinations are and I
hope you enjoy I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
