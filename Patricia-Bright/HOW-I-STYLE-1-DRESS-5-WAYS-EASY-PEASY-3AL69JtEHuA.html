different but I thought is a really good
idea for some of you guys for quite 50
and enjoy recycling stuff in their
wardrobe and I'm going to show you how I
wear this dress and five different ways
so daytime and evening time because not
all of us have got time and money to
keep buying new outfits all the time
this dress is really cheap it's from
misguided and I think it was like 12 99
or $13.99 it was a really good price and
it's stripy and it's off the shoulder
I'll show I'll stand up so you can see
actually so it's a stripy off the
shoulder body con
it's a body con midi skirt dress I'll
show you the bottom a bit later but I
found that there are a few different
ways that I can wear it so I'm just
going to show you five of them so I hope
you enjoy this video so guys this is the
dress just so you can get a better idea
and it's just an off-the-shoulder body
con midi skirt dress the first one I'm
gonna wear this is for the daytime and
what I'm going to do is use a jumper and
lay that with the leather coat to make
it a lot more casual and daytime
appropriate
I've added a slouchy bag and the pair of
kids or any flat shoes to just keep it
nice and casual this is my favorite way
to make a daytime look which is by
adding a denim shirt it's so cool and it
really does dress down a dressy item and
I'm also layering it with a jump on top
if it's kind of cold outside my JustFab
pick for me this is my purple satchel
bag I actually love the way it kind of
offsets this outfit with some color
so for my evening look I switch my shoes
and I get strappy and literally a cute
bag and a blazer is a great way to kind
of make this dress more evening
appropriate
my next evening look is a bit more dance
appropriate so if you're going out to
shake a leg then a chunky train a pair
of leather shorts and the little clutch
bag is a great way to do it and you can
definitely get a jiggle on in the pair
of shorts
so just switched up my lipstick income
from you because I'm going to be adding
a little sparkle sparkle I'm a girly
girl as I love sparkles and you can
literally layer a skirt over the dress
and add a belt
for my strappy sandals again as they're
great for your legs and are just really
flattering and because I'm wearing all
this sparkle I've kept my accessories to
a minimum you can also just the outfit
up with a massive jacket like I have so
did you guys like all 5 ways I could
probably come up with like 6 or 7 do you
think I could maybe I could make sure
you guys check me out on my blog which
is moments of style calm I've got loads
of posts up there from life to more
fashion stuff and make sure you follow
me on Instagram Twitter and Facebook I
will see you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
