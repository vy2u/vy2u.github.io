I'm going to share with you some of my
tips and tricks that I like to do to
basically just feel really good about
myself and to really treat myself like
number one and I don't if you're
anything like me but in the kind of
person now sometimes I get everybody
else and everything I'm else doing kind
of get in the way of you know putting me
first and you know what if you don't
look after yourself who's gonna look
after you as fiance says it you know I
got me myself and AH in the end women we
always put everything else ahead of
ourselves and I think it's so important
plus just to kind of stop you know take
a moment to breathe take them to treat
ourselves and just really do the best by
ourselves so the first thing I like to
do is to create a vision and usually to
create a vision I will basically do mood
boarding but I know lots of people use
the term scrapbooking which is basically
exactly what it is and I know this might
sound a bit juvenile or a little bit you
know old school but I think it's really
imperative to kind of give yourself a
visual idea of what you want out of life
and you know as they say without a
vision the people perish and I'm the
kind of person I will I'm not ashamed to
say what I actually want for my life if
I'm going to be number one then I need
to be honest with myself about what I
want and that might be from the things
that I want to the things I want to
experience to the places I want to go
and also how I want to feel so I
currently have I have on my mood board a
Maserati because you know what why not
and I'm not even a car person but I do
like things that are beautiful and
there's a time I watching YouTube could
be analyzed and he basically just rats
cars in like different colors and I find
it so aesthetically pleasing but and I
won't you know cut out designer items
but I like things that I can only aspire
to have because I'm even close to having
those things right now
but it's nice to kind of think to myself
you know what if I put this in front of
me I might be able to manifest these
things but not only with
stuff I like to do things such as places
I might to go food I'd like to eat or to
cook experiences I want to have anything
about making a mood board is that it
takes time and it means that you've got
to turn everything off and get everyone
out of the way and focus on you and your
vision and make yourself number one and
I think when you do that it just kind of
heard you in sentence you and also just
gives you a low like kind of like it's
like a pep talk I find mood boarding a
bit of a pep talk for myself so the next
thing I like to do is to eat well and
you guys know that I am a foodie food is
life it makes me happy if I'm going
somewhere I'm only going if there's food
you know I'm not kind of person and I
really like that loads of us are so busy
and we end up eating out all the time I
said one of the key things that I
realize about myself that eating love
makes me happy or eating good food
regularly makes me happy so recently I
have begun meal prepping and not kind of
in that kind of gym freak way like I've
only got to eat certain calories but
what I've kind of done is try to
organize my meals will be to ensure that
I eat as much veg and good food that I
like on a daily basis because a lot of
the time when I get in or when I'm at
home the last thing I can think about is
cooking and chopping and all that stuff
it's long so I've started basically on
the weekend just chopping up and
preparing all the stuff that I want to
eat later on in the week I've normally
leave my vegetables and just chop those
up and give them a rinse and put them in
airtight containers and then for each
day I can bring those out and put them
over into a salad or stir fry and then
things such as rice and and pasta and
noodles and anything like that I can
basically cook from Fred and I find that
if I know what I've got to eat and I
don't even have to think about it I feel
ten times better I don't know if it's
just me but like just knowing that got
food and it's
good and it's tasty and lovely the next
thing I like to do is obviously to look
after my skin and for those of you who
know my skin has been the thing that I
really have enjoyed kind of transforming
and then we have all these hormonal
changes and stuff like it's gone from
goods to amazing - OH - oh God - okay we
need to work on something and for me I
like to have a very simple skin care
regime but I do use acids once in a
while not like acid but I like that
glycolic acid lactic acid but I also
like to use things that are quite gentle
on my skin as well and I notice that
when I'm not really taking my care of
myself or treating myself like number
one my skin goes all the way downhill I
think so many girls can relate to that
when they're busy or they're tired or
they're focused on other stuff stress
causes their skin to break up but also
lack of treating your skin well I'm
working with Nivea in collaboration on
this video Hey and I will say they have
a new range of gentle cleansers which
are really really amazing when I say
they are gentle they are so good for
sensitive skin but not only that they
are really effective as well and the
face wipes are great if it's a long
night out and we've all been there you
know where you you're tired and you just
don't want to do a full-blown or regimen
you're just like let's get off white
face wipe out but it's amazing if you
can get a face wipe that is gentle but
effective and good for your skin as well
but I do suffer from skin that is quite
dry it time and quite sensitive at the
time as well so for me just taking those
time each evening to kind of wipe down
my face and use a good cleanser that is
gentle and effective is really really
important to me and then on the weekends
or once a month I can give myself you
know a more expensive treatment to
really keep on top of the kind of skin I
want to have next way that I've been
treating myself is like number one is by
focusing in my body and everybody talks
about exercise and blah blah blah and
I've done exercise videos but in the
past but you know I'm not gonna lie like
is really hard it's really hard to stay
motivated it's really hard to stay fit
and it you know you see Missy we're like
at the gym every morning like doing 4k
round I might just like who are you that
who does that I'm in my bed and but like
it does make the difference
so um and obviously you know since
having a baby and stuff my body has
really really changed so what I've done
is I've actually enlisted the help of a
personal trainer and I used to like and
kind of look down and personal training
like who needs that it's just a waste of
time
but it's made so much difference to me
however for most people who just can't
get a personal trainer one of the things
you can do is find a gym buddy
so that might be a friend or family
member or boyfriend someone who you can
work with in the gym who's going to
motivate you and push you and it's a
great way to make going to the gym or
exercising not such a tedious thing for
videos of like these women who've had
body transformations I'll link them down
below and a lot of people were doing it
so they might run fit or cost it or
something like that and they basically
get together as a group and they just
run run like four to five times a week
and to see the transformation that some
of these women have had was amazing and
the reality is is because they had that
support of people helping them to really
get their body to where they wanted it
to be so the final thing I like to do is
to practice mindfulness and I am a very
spiritual person and I didn't know that
mindfulness is different for every
single person and some people don't even
see it as a consideration but there are
stats to show that people who made the
day or people who pray or people who
take the time to be reflective are
happier and more confident I've had
times that I've been so busy and I want
to run off and do this and do this and
I'll just end up being a horrible
scatterbrain but there's nothing like
just taking be it ten minutes to half an
hour water even five minutes in the
morning to stop be reflective and just
you know have gratitude and in my heart
towards my life and my experiences makes
all the difference and of all these
things that I was going to say just to
try one thing
so give yourself five minutes in the
morning before you jump out of the bed
before you cut that mobile phone just
being mindful so guys those are some of
my favorite tips for treating myself
like number one and obviously you don't
have to do all of these but you know
just taking one or another is really
going to make the difference to you and
I really feel like just doing simple
things like this make a difference to me
so guys I hope you enjoyed that video
and I will catch you later hi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
