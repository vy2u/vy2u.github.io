nice setup you guys keep commenting it's
actually my bedroom it's still kind of
not finished because it's really quite
boring in here at the moment but we're
hopefully getting some pictures and a
bit more color here and there but yeah
this is my bedroom anyway today I
thought I'd show you a how I wear
trousers video because you guys know
I've been doing the whole wardrobe
revamp and I've been buying loads of
trousers but I found that my trousers
and my leg where is it like just plain
black jeans or leggings or just plain
and I've realized that they're quite
vibrant and I'm glad that I've been able
to pick up more vibrant things but I
thought I'll show you how I would style
these and maybe world where the first
look are these lime trousers here and as
you can tell they're really quite bright
and they have got a really nice pattern
you might not be able to see the detail
of the pattern on it right now but there
are tailored trouser and they're from
Topshop but they're really structured
really tailored there's no stretch in
these at all and they've got a seam just
down the front which always makes it
look really small
so next I really love these pants these
two know same pants these trousers
they're absolutely amazing someone
called them clockwork orange' trousers
on my Instagram you guys have to follow
me on instagram because I do post a lot
there I'll link it below my Instagram
and my Facebook and my Twitter I think
these are great for going out if you're
looking to make a statement like go
climbing or something like that these
are really really good option
so next is my leather trousers and yeah
I have to say these get a thumbs up
you guys know my problems with leather
trousers they don't fit on my waist that
much and they can sag here and there but
if I wear a long t-shirt it's fine but
these are my Zara leather trousers
they're not real never play guitars and
they've also got a zip on the end and I
love leather trousers because I find
them to be so flattering gorgeous sexy
sleek sophisticated they're just
everything you can get in a trouser
perfect so I'm wearing it with like a
t-shirt here because I love a little bit
of a casual look with another trousers
but then I can add a blazer and make it
look a lot more sophisticated I could go
for pointy Hills or like killer trainers
I think everyone has to have a pair of
leather trousers might you have to
and next it's actually floral leggings I
know these are trousers but I never used
to be into patterned leggings or pattern
trousers that much but really becoming a
big fan of them and these are just
amazing these are from romwe patterned
leggings all those kind of things are
really really cool really really
different but because they can kind of
stand out quite a bit you need to go
really base it on the top
so like I hoped you'd like that me or
how I starve video they gave you a few
ideas because it is quite cold we're not
having much of a spring I'm just trying
to you know switch it up a bit with
other pieces and hopefully I get to it
