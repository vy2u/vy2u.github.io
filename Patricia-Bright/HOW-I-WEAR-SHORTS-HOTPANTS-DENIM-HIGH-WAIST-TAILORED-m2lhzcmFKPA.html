video is gonna be on short I want to
show you a few different ways that I
would wear a pair of what a pair of
shorts basically from the tailor shorts
culottes high-waisted and denim it's
just a quickly put together video but I
might be like is there any other things
that you want me to kind of talk about
then leave a comment below I will go
ahead and start addressing this thing
say that's watching guys bye so guys
this is the first pair of shorts that
I'm wearing and they're the denim short
the denim shorts are a lot more casual a
lot more beach girl and just quiet you
know I'm so relaxed I don't really care
you can easily tho dress up a pair of
denim shorts with a pair of black tights
like black tights high heels and a
blazer and switch off the way it looks
these were mates you name they actually
got that from the back they are quite
short so I tried to kind of pull them
down regularly but when you have a pair
of shorts that I was really short try
and offset it by covering up a lot more
on the top and I've got my
off-the-shoulder knitted jumper from
Topshop bought this in the sale and it's
actually a size 14 I love buying clothes
in bigger sizes as well because you can
get it to kind of have that snout do
that oh I don't care and effect which is
this what this kind of jumper has
wearing it with my Topshop loafers which
I hope you can see on camera probably
see if I stand here but they're just the
slippers that are really on trend at the
moment and they're
okay guys so this is an example of
high-waisted shorts but they're almost
kind of my tailored shorts as well
because of the pleat
but what we do is we just stick to the
high-waisted trend so high waist is
event my favorite and I think it's
because you can create a new body shape
with high waisted shorts I don't have
any hips but when I kind of wear
something higher on the waist it creates
the illusion of being more cinched in
even if you're in a larger woman and you
want it to create I don't know more
defined curves you can definitely do
that with high waisted shorts and
high-waisted trousers
so with these shorts I like to wear
these with anything really this example
I've got here is a lace crop top which I
purchase bomb but I get this one
catching them and so if you can hear a
cat meowing yeah I got this top from pay
to name and it's a nice swing top but
should you see even even with these
shorts it looks really cute and cool
fits really well my short perform the
top shot recently in the sale I'll show
you what they look like from the back so
these are not that shot
okay so this look here kind of switched
it up or made it a little bit different
and this isn't the tailor shop
now the tailor shops are really smart
look that you can do you can wear them
with plain black tights high heels and a
blazer and really really smart you can
go out to dinner but I thought I'd just
kind of change it up and make it a
little bit more edgy a little bit more
rough kind of like me so I'm wearing it
with my a those tights is a cross tights
with like the knee detailing I thought
they really cool and really different
and my tailor shorts are wrong hmm but
I've seen people wear things like this
to work now know where I work ha to work
and you can do that as well as fishermen
it's got the nice complete down the very
front loving it with a white t-shirt
which is from Zara and a denim jacket
which is actually from patronym I don't
really worried in the brackets that much
I thought I can really wear something
like this or something that's really
really monochrome and small and not feel
a bit too grungy to kind of dirty
looking I hope you can see but I'm
wearing my ankle boots which are from
office for this look
okay guys so this is the final kind of
way that you can do this look and it's
the kulaks cool up shorts I think are
really cool if it's really hot because
they're breezy they're culottes to the
kind of resemble a skirt they're really
baggy they really loose often they have
pockets they should have probably me I
think and yeah these pair are from H&amp;amp;M
but I think what the culottes is a good
idea to offset it with quite a fitted
top because you are creating lots and
lots and lots of for you on the bottom
something fitted and quite silly woman
these look really really cool so you
enjoy that video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
