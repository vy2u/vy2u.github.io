your hair straighteners are you going
over and over again for tangles of ways
and you just can't seem to get your hair
straight are you just tired of this you
don't have to go through this darling
I'm gonna show you how not to go mad
with straightening your hair so my funny
accents done and let me just go ahead
with the tutorial all you need to do is
brush through your hair brush your all
the kinks and waves and try to get your
hair as straight as possible you'll then
need some straightness some hair serum
just to add a bit of shine to your hair
I don't know I looked mad doing that and
you shouldn't rub it through your hair
and it will also help to smooth your
hair down you then need a thin tooth
comb this is the key part of this trick
you don't want to grab a section of hair
and comb through it and then you want to
hold it onto your hair and basically
place it below your hair straighteners
and as you move down your hair you want
to move down with the comb and the comb
were basically straighten out your hair
before the hair straighteners and this
gives you a really smooth silky finish
I'll show that again in slo-mo so I use
the comb and the hair straighteners in
one accord and this gives me a silky
smooth finish really easy to do and you
can also do it the reverse way if you
want to I don't think it works as well
but it's just easier and you can see how
nice straight and shiny my hair looks I
think I'm just getting excited that's
why I'm just showing you need brushing
it and with me done you can see it's
really straight really shiny and a lot
better than you look before guys this is
so easy it's called the comb chase
method try it out let me know what you
think</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
