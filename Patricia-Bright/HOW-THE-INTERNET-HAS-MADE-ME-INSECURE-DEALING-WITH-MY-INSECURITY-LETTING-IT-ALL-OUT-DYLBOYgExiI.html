insecure because I was constantly
second-guessing myself how I perceived
myself and lo and behold it had me
feeling all kinds of crappy right
comparison is the thief of joy but you
know sometimes it's really hard to not
like look at what new cease doing Mary's
doing or whatever I think or maybe I'm
not anywhere near as good as hey guys
welcome to my channel today's video is a
little bit different because I wanted to
talk on something that's been affecting
me recently and I'm going to make faces
because I really hate you know moaning
and I really don't like you know talking
about things that maybe are a bit not as
positive as a norm now because you guys
know what I'm like I like to bring value
and I always try and speak on a matter
when I've been through it and when I've
come on the other side and I feel like
I'm in the process of coming out the
other side which is what I feel like I'm
going to talk about this now and also
I'm just awkward so like I laugh at my
own peril on my own bad situations
because that's the kind of person I am
and I don't know if you guys notice I
took a little time off of youtube but my
last video was pre-recorded but I feel
like it was really NIC necessary and
what I wanted to talk about today is
basically with dealing with insecurities
and the thing about being on YouTube and
being on the internet and then being the
person that I am a lot of people don't
allow you to feel down so what are you
what are you insecure about because you
look great you've got a great life or
what are you upset what your emotion no
about you you've got everything that you
could ever want and sometimes you're in
a position or you're a really confident
person or you speak about confidence and
self confidence and it's like people
almost make I felt like I actually am
not allowed to feel down like any other
girl at some point in time because I'm
just not allowed that privilege because
I am quote-unquote
lucky and I you know I am I'm not going
to lie I am significantly blessed I have
a lovely family I am poor
village in lots of differences of the
word but it doesn't affect the fact that
sometimes we just get down and I am a
relatively quantum confident person but
I will say that you know things kind of
got I got a little less confident of
late and I feel like it's been over the
last year and a half that I just felt
just more apprehensive about myself and
I look back up like my old videos I'm an
old self and I was a very brazen like I
just didn't care I had know also that I
know chill like I just didn't care and
that was a sense of confidence but also
I feel like it was this element of
naivety because I was you know in the
from 21 and I'm 22 and I'm just like
whatever I don't care about anything I'm
amazing and you know my way or the
highway which is kind of how I've always
been as a person and then actually when
unlikely get a couple of knocks and you
have a couple of things and it kind of
affects you and I feel like my
confidence really had taken a shot Bobby
over the last like year and a half and I
do think like hormonal new things
changing and having a baby really had an
impact about how I felt about myself and
then I realized that this insecurity had
been creeping in and creeping in and
creeping in and genuinely affecting me
and it's only night I can say this now
that I've come out on the other side
because I was feeling quite down at
times quite regularly I would be
extremely down about myself and it's
this overwhelm scent of one might
physically I don't I don't look like why
look like before I had a baby and I
don't feel like okay don't look like
what's quote-unquote trendy or popular
which is which is fine and obviously I
was battling my skin changing you know I
didn't have the snapback that everybody
else had and then not only the kind of
comp not not feeling confident in my
body but not confident in myself and the
work that I do and I was always very
confident in like the videos that I'm
making the content and making my drive
and I'm a very driven person I think the
problem with me is that by the way this
video is going to be very rambly I can
already tell but I feel like I'm just
giving myself therapy
getting off my chest and about to start
something fresh and new
but yeah I'm the kind of person like I'm
very critical and extremely critical
myself there's nothing that I do or
nothing I can Cheever i all think that
oh um that like i've done it well or
that I've done it good enough and every
time I see something I do I'm like I
could have done that better like I'm
almost at a million subscribers can you
guys believe it like I I just can't
fathom it and then I get these questions
in my head like Oh may I go show a
million subscribers all these people are
watching you and you can't be how you
normally are you've got to be better uh
do you really think you deserve that
many subscribers there's so many people
who are better than you and and then in
my head I kind of create these massive
conversations of over criticism and then
it makes me insecure and I realized that
I kind of was developing these cycles
and you guys know me I've been I was
someone who was very like confident I
might life in death is in the power of
the time so speak life to yourself and
like in the mirror I talk to yourself
whatever and I kind of stopped doing
that and I started being really negative
and like I'll be like pursues you you
look awful like you know and it sounds
so bad I'm getting a little bit
emotional about it so we're just going
to suck back and I'll be like you look
awful Patricia and I'll say these things
to myself I'm glad to like force myself
to not say that like wake up and just go
look at myself that's just a horrible
mindset in place to be in and then we're
like there's so many videos that I've
done and being like I hate the way I
look I hate what I've done I don't think
it's any good and I just been them and I
just need them and I just like I don't
know it's just this constant sense of
not feeling like I'm doing enough or not
not feeling like I'm good enough and not
and I think this is something that
everyone kinds of feels in a world where
like you're just kind of comparing
yourself to everything and I also say
that comparison is the thief of joy
but you know sometimes it's really hard
to not like look at what Lucy's doing
Mary's doing or whatever I think or
maybe I'm not anywhere near as good as
them and I'm constantly trying to be
quote-unquote superwoman and then when I
don't meet that mark and sometimes I
just wanna you know veg out on the sofa
and watch
Kelly I feel so right gross about myself
I don't know if it's just me I just felt
awful if I'm not constantly being
proactive and stuff but yeah so these
are some of the other insecurities I've
been dealing with and also the
insecurities of you know of am ia good
mother
I'm a good wife someone left the comment
that literally cut me from like to my
soul and it was if they said that and
because it was when I went to Morocco
and I was there for like three days for
like a project that I was doing and then
someone made the comment oh so you're on
holiday again clear you weren't ready to
be a mother you should probably just
need grace with your mom and call it a
day and like cut my soul because it's
like everything I do like all the work I
do obviously I love creation and I think
if you're not creating you're not
bringing Randy what are you doing but I
do it I do this for my family I do this
for myself I do this to be a better mom
and to be a better wife and to make sure
that grace has what she she needs and I
and I realize that in the real world in
the real world a lot of women at six
months at four months in America of
women are back at work their children
are in full-time childcare like and like
they're working nine to six and they
come and pick up their child and evening
and I'm lucky that I don't even have to
do that I can have a lot more
flexibility and stuff but obviously it
causes me to question myself and I I
kind of realized that I became more
insecure because I was constantly
second-guessing myself I was constantly
you know having using in conversations
with myself in my mind and I was
convinced ain't it's not quite good
enough you don't look very good in that
blah blah blah and the words I kept
using like around myself we're just
making me feel more and more down and
you know what yes you're my body hasn't
looked the same and my level of work
hasn't been exactly the same but I think
there's a key element of acceptance and
then also change and and so for me I've
got to a place of right I've accepted
that things are different and Alex
did that the power is kind of in my hand
to work out how I'm going to react to
that and then what I want to do about it
so I kind of set myself some challenges
and I really planned in my upgrading
with like upgrading my life my my mind
my body like upgrading everything so I
hope you guys can join me on the journey
there's nothing specific yeah I haven't
even got there yet but we'll see you
know I'm like I'm a challenge it but the
first thing I really wanted to do is
just change the way I kind of comment on
myself to myself and many of you guys
probably might relate to this in where
you kind of say things and you're down
you're down about yourself to yourself
and you don't realize that that has such
a negative effect and all right honestly
I as a Christian I genuinely believe
that you know you know life and death is
in the power of the tongue speak those
things that are not as though they are
and it's made a difference and I I'll it
she was when I was younger it was like
adamant to never say anything negative
about myself like abdomen I wouldn't I'd
say what what wasn't as it though it was
and every time I spoke like that like it
would just reap it would just reap the
fruits and then I allowed like
negativity to come into like my language
and how I perceive myself and lo and
behold it had me feeling all kinds of
crappy right so there we go so one of
the key things I've started to do is
basically when I'm about to criticize
myself or judge myself I kind of stop
myself and then I kind of you know
started to like interject an opposite
word like you know you look crappy like
no babe you look amazing you had a baby
look great and you can do something
about that we're going to go to the gym
later I'll do that so just kind of
reversing and stopping myself in the
moment where I'm about to put myself
down is really important in helping me
feel a bit more secure and then also um
I also believe that faith without works
is dead you can say all the things that
you want about your life but you also
have to take the steps to do that so for
me it's a case of obviously working out
and obviously dedicating my time to
being more present and creating some of
the stuff I know that are in my heart to
come yay
I'm out here doing videos and absolutely
love it but there's so many more things
that I want to do there's so much like
in my in my spirit in my heart that I'm
passionate about I want to push forward
on and then I stop myself cuz I just
don't feel comfortable or then I feel
like I'm gonna felt I'm not very good at
it and obviously like I already run like
a business that's doing really well and
then there's more I want to do and then
I kind of stopped myself to say well
batricia are you doing too much no like
no I stop that now you can never do too
much keep creating it one of the key
things I'm doing is kind of doing those
things that I say that I'm going to do
it and making it a point a point of
purpose to make sure I do that and you
know it's a journey I'm still on it I'm
still doing it and I love like being
held accountable like on my social media
like my snapchat me it's the government
stuff like that so yeah and then also
the final thing I've realized about
insecurity is that is very much normal
although everybody might look like
they're amazing their life is perfect
and I think I'm the number one person
who who kind of comes across in that
manner but you never know what someone's
feeling genuinely about themselves like
I get really insecure and I've been
really insecure and those people who you
think are amazing in their life is
perfect you don't know that in their
head potentially they feel like that and
this I think it's part of a process if I
make everyone has these kind of ups and
downs and these ups and downs in life
and I kind of went quite quite down
emotionally and how I felt about myself
another thing I'm remembering is it's
okay to be down for a moment but make
the choice and the decision not to stay
in it like being permanently insecure
it's just gonna make you more secure and
actually it doesn't change anything so
making the choice to kind of come out of
it and say well I'm going to change my
language I'm going to change my action
I'm going to stop you know you know
comparing myself to this another person
situation or appearance or whatever to
kind of then kind of stay in my own lane
and be secure in myself because at the
end today the only person I can try to
be is myself the best person I can be is
myself so focusing
myself is what its kind of helping me to
get out of like feeling insecure and
stuff like that right so that is me just
getting stuff off my chest and letting
you know where I've been at and I know
that some people will be like Patricia
you're the last person who we think be
insecure and you talk about being
self-confident all the time and stuff
like that but that's not a reason for me
not to ever feel down and actually a lot
of the things I talk about it's because
they're experiences that I've had like
not feeling good enough nothing and
confident in myself these I speak from
experience and I always talk about it
when I'm on the other side but it's
still good for me to come to you as I
come at me and you know I'm still going
through this and I feel like I'm about
I'm about to get over there were some
moments where I was just like so down
but I just saw that I don't want to do
anything I just want to stay in bed and
I just felt crap about myself which is
almost on my old like form of depression
but I don't like to start claiming that
kind of stuff or myself but um for me
I'm blessed and lucky enough to
basically be able to realize that I'm
dealing with that and to get out of it
like force myself out of it and make
some changes to really make a big
difference to myself and I want to
inspire and encourage any of you guys to
do that if you're feeling that way and
if there's any tips and tricks you have
when it comes to dealing with your
insecurities or whatever please leave

will be really useful to other dogs who
