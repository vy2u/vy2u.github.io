all about my bright clear skin regime
now you guys recently have noticed that
my skin's looking a lot more glowing
dewy and no it's not just due to the
joys of marriage I've been changing up
my regime and I do I'm gonna go for it
and I will show you exactly how this
works so having perfect skin is all
about developing the right regime mine
consists of four steps so cleansing and
exfoliating with hydroxy acids treating
with products that kind of suppress
melanin production protecting from UV
rays and moisturizing afterwards so my
first step is to exfoliate and I use
hydroxy acids to do this it might sound
a bit scary but really these are derives
from fruit acids and milk such as lactic
acids and what hydroxy acid dues they
remove the top layer of skin and allow
for new are healthy skin cells to appear
stimulates collagen production and
ensures that your skin looks bright and
gets rid of all the dead cells
I list a few of my favorite products in
the downbar for this kind of work one
thing I will say that it's important for
any product that you do you let it sit
in your face or period of time three
minutes minimum before rinsing off this
way you give it time to do its work
before you move on to your next step so
the next step would be to apply a
treatment and this will be a treatment
that basically inhibits the production
of melanin or breaks it down
vitamin C is a natural way to do this
and it actually has amazing effects one
it stimulates collagen production that
means my skin is going to look plump and
fat and just juicy too it's an
antioxidant which means that it protects
my skin from the free radicals that come
from the Sun and three the most
important thing for skin brightening is
that it can break down pigmentation and
so will help to brighten your skin so
here I'm using a serum which I bought
from the body shop
and basically this is the best way to
topically apply vitamin C now one thing
about vitamin C is that it is very
reactive this means that it kind of
oxidizes very quickly or in simple terms
it swells very quickly it needs to be
used as soon as possible especially if
it's exposed to air so they've made it
in this solution I think to basically
ensure that you have the purest form and
the most potent form of vitamin C that
isn't exposed to air so I kind of do the
mixing in and I kind of changed and put
the lids on as soon as possible
and make sure that I produce the serum
which I only use for ten days morning
and night
so I apply a number of dabs on my finger
and just apply it in try to avoid my
eyes and I also put it on my dark spots
that I used to have I don't really have
any anymore actually but if I did that's
where I put it and it really does break
down the dark spots and evens out my
skin tone as you can see my skin looks
really clear and even these days so I
rub it in I don't need to wash it off it
at all I can apply my sunscreen
afterwards again it's an antioxidant so
it works great with sunscreen and it
feels really moisturizing so my next
step which is vital is to protect from
UV rays even though I am black yes I now
apply sunblock as I've learnt that the
Sun can actually make hyperpigmentation
darker if you've got dark spots and
you're exposing yourself to the Sun
you're probably making it worse we all
need to protect ourselves from UV rays
no matter how dark our skin is the Sun
will age our skin quick tip never rub it
in just let it kind of penetrate and
form a protective barrier
so my final step is to moisturize we all
know the benefits of moisturization even
if you do have oily skin look for an
oil-free moisturizer and there you go
that's my bright skin and regime I hope
you found it helpful thanks for watching
guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
