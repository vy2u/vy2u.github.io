doing this makeup look for you guys it
is kind of a glamorous like night out
kind of look and it might look a little
bit different because I did something
different I basically decided to bake my
makeup and this is an old trend but
basically I never knew anything about
baking makeup until my younger cousin
told me about it as like no makeup
always looks good Erica she's like yeah
because I let it bake
I think what's baking makeup and what I
found out is basically been around for
age is and basically it's using powder
and and I'm using the Ben Nye powders
and letting it sit for a good amount of
time and what you do I basically let sit
while I did the rest of my face and
you'll see it all in the video but it's
a great you know more of a dramatic
makeup look I wouldn't do this every day
but if I've got photos to take or
somewhere to go then I would do
something like this and I really like
the finish especially because I'm
getting more and more oily I'm such an
oily person right now it's ridiculous to
perm at and like glowing so this is my
baked face guy so I hope you enjoyed
this video give it a thumbs up if you'd
like to see a couple more makeup trends
or makeup tutorials especially for like
the end of summer season and yet love
you all catch you later
bye so before I start the vague I'm
going to go ahead and do my normal
routine which is to use a primer to help
mattify my face before I apply a
foundation I use the benefits
Porefessional and I go ahead and use my
current favourite foundation which is
from NARS I love the finish and the
color of this foundation
so I go ahead and do my normal brow
routine I'm not going to show you that
here because it is alarm but then I go
ahead and highlight the main areas of my
face like I would normally and also do
some contouring
so moving on to the baking process it's
very easy all you need are your normal
powders I'm using the Ben I powder which
are very very famous I'm going to link
where I found them in the description
bar below and I go ahead and add a
really large amount I combine two
colours to get a color I think works for
my skin tone
but you can use any ones that you know
work for you and it doesn't have to be
these powders you can use any powder
you just apply an excessive amount while
it basically soaks up the oils and you
can leave it on for about five to ten
minutes while you do the rest of your
face so I've got my hands on the Naked
palette from Urban Decay and it's the
smoky one I love the colors and if
anyone knows me I like simple makeup so
if I can use one palette to create a
whole look I'm good to go
so the palette is really really nice I
use a liquid liner to create my normal
signature look but this is a little bit
smoky for me and what you'll see is that
the powder is just kind of sitting there
and absorbing and baking I'm finishing
my look with these velour lashes you
guys know I am in love with these
they're so flattering and so beautiful I
have a coupon code which you can find in
my description bar below guys moving on
to my lips I use light north and I'm
using a very Victoria from Charlotte
Tilbury to give me just a nice matte
finish
so after your whole face is done you're
baking should be done people use a fan
brush usually but I don't have one but
you basically just dust it all off on
what you should have is the gorgeous
matte and flawless phase to finish it
off I go ahead and add a blush and a
highlight because you can actually look
quite matte after this and it's nice to
add a little bit more dimension back to
my face so guys I am fully baked let me
know if you like this look I'm not a
makeup artist but I'm definitely trying
my best and enjoying the process so you
want to see more videos let me know give
me a thumbs up and make sure you're
subscribed and I'll catch you over on
all my social thanks for watching guys
