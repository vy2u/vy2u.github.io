channel today's video is going to be a
chassis video and I thought like it's
been a long time since about he sat down
and done one of these talk and I kind of
shied away from just talking boomers but
you guys know what I'm like but you know
one I just got so fully embrace but is
this is just the way I live is what I do
and today we're going to start off with
a bag I really want to talk about how to
be aware bit and not really that but
really about how to be on your a-game
especially if you have been in a place
which hasn't been amazing if you've been
down and I feel like overall going
through that stage of just feeling a bit
flat and a little bit down almost like
they let themselves go have you ever let
yourself go like the gutters getting a
little bit bigger the skin care routine
hasn't been great yet you haven't been
moisturizing as much your hands are kind
of crusty yeah that's it yet in your
self go that is it listen I think my
does that leave hugs your feet okay I'm
going to act like it doesn't happen but
for those of us who are kind of
permanently in that state of letting
ourselves go how do we get out of it so
if you select your company in that stage
you've been there you've done that or
you're just wanting to avoid it
hopefully this video would be helpful to
you the first steps is really bringing
it back when you've let yourself both is
identification listen you need to
realize and have a good look in the
mirror be like girl no like no and I'm
not saying in that way where you make
yourself feel like crap or where you are
very judgmental or critical source up or
down in yourself but it's really
important to take a cold hard look at
your current self and this might be
physically it might be emotionally it
might be going over using your time and
letting yourself go can be in so many
different ways and it's really important
to take that moment to just have a look
and see like where am i right now so the
next step is to create a benchmark and
the whole principle about this is that
it's really hard to go somewhere if you
don't even know the direction you want
to go what you
the end goal and I think people very
rarely take this cold hard look at their
lives themselves a face or could I want
to be what do I want to do what makes
you you and when I ask myself these
things I realize that to mean the thing
that with me is my family and my friend
and really feeling a lot of love and
interaction also something that drives
and with me is progress I like to set
goals in lots of different areas and I
like to be working towards those goals
not necessarily that I always meet them
but progress for me is like so important
and a lot of times if I'm feeling like
I've let myself go or getting down I'm
not working towards any goal I'm just
pretending like they're not there so
those are some of the things that I
would do when it comes to benchmarking
but everyone has different goals in lots
of different areas or different
benchmarks so you're currently here you
need to work out what your here is so
the next step is to take action and it
sounds really simple but action is the
hardest thing to do but literally the
first step of the thing is the hardest
one and also that you get momentum but
what I like to do is set myself little
goals and little challenges everyone's
got to work out what are the realities
actions that they can take to them
improve their entire life which is what
I like to do little actions reads big
results so often when you've let
yourself go it's because you've lost a
love of something on joy what makes you
happy what makes you tick so one of the
things that I really think is important
to do is to rekindle an old flame like
an old boyfriend you know like hey you
want a sucker no nothing like that
no no no do not do that it could end
very good feeling but I mean old flame
in regard to something that you used to
do a lot but you might notice that
they're not doing so much anymore for me
I realize that I stopped reading books
and you may realize that you might have
stopped listening or singing if you sad
that's another thing actually assisting
or
I can't thing I by the wake up every
morning and I was seeing and my dad
always used to say that the way how he
wake up in the morning is because he
would hear my voice and I find that just
such a beautiful thing and realized that
it was like very typical with me so you
might have noticed there may have been
something that you used to do be it
baking or putting on makeup or calling
your friends or reading or writing that
you're not doing that you used to do and
it might be time to just rekindle that
flame and do it again and honestly it's
going to make you feel amazing I wanna
say it's important to make a commitment
to yourself about certain things and if
it's against that you put the foot down
you see you know what and stopping all
this other stuff and the thing that
almost makes me be my entire self I'm
going to start doing again the next
thing is to do one thing do just one
thing sounds crazy a lot of times when
you let yourself go it is because you
saw maybe entirely overwhelmed by all
the things that you've got to do that
you haven't done all those kind of of it
otherwise or whatever right that's what
happens when that happens the need I
have got to this place like it's pretty
fun in that place interface I have to do
just one task just one tub to get all
the other stuff or try and begin it push
it to the side and focus on a one thing
and what I said I've been completing it
from start to finish
so it won't be just filming a video or
making that phone call to my accountant
or having that difficult conversation
with your friends just do that one thing
so when you complete it you'll feel like
you know what all right I've done that
really important thing and the funny
thing about the brain or how we work is
that when you achieve a task actually it
gives you more confidence to feel that
you can achieve more more time so the
reason I say do one thing isn't just
that you keep doing one thing forever
but that you build more confidence to do
more and one more if you feel like
you're always dropping all the ball
eventually you kind of thought before
that you're done that your D hat or
something that it's what you're stupid
and then that he made you for what and
worse and worse but you need to put your
confidence in your ability and that's
why it is important to give yourself
just one task to do and should do it
well this is what I've been doing and I
love it and it cetera and clear all the
way out and I think if you follow me my
snapchat my Instagram I've been going on
about my green my house for like the
longest and I went through my whole
makeup collection I thought maybe Ichigo
is coming I've gone through my clothing
I comfortable the stuff I don't need I
just do it always just bombing you down
have you gone from your wardrobe well
the last time you went through there I'm
sure there's some cobwebs hiding in the
back go through your water it go through
your shoes go through the books go
through on both sides all this stuff
that is hanging around this is burden on
your head get rid of it and that
includes people who are no good in your
life as well so the final thing is to
change your focus if you want to be
right if you want to be tight if you
want to be the baddest girl around then
you need to ensure that you are focused
correctly and a lot of the times
mentally and emotionally we are
distracted by so many different things
getting in the way of us feeling great
Johanna so insane how many things do you
think are out there right now about
impacting your ability to be great mm-hm
acting named him as where I'm phone
could be something that should excite
you but it could be something to get you
up in the morning
ready raring to go and when things come
to destructuring including yourself
including your branding telling you
you're not good enough when you can't do
that you don't let that blah blah blah
you need to know within that switch I'm
focusing in my vision here's my five and
I'm going straight for it
and so my hands are flying everywhere
because you know that I get very excited
so change your focus and you can change
your life so I hope that was useful and
helpful to some of you guys who might be
out there maybe feeling a bit lysergic
definitely not realize about of it
around and just feeling a bit and
honestly it really does start from
working from an emotional and a mental
perspective and
up is all really great and wonderful I
long will of it uniting beauty and
makeup and passion for them in we've
already got to work on the inside to be
the most beautiful we possibly can
