welcome to my channel I'm a really good
mood today and probably no visit it
wasn't meant to have an intro but I felt
like I just wanted to say a couple of
words before I put this lookbook out and
I know it sounds really sad about what
this video and I kind of felt a little
bit happy on the inside and the reason
being is that I realized I've noticed
that just some of my kind of old self
confidence or physical confidence coming
back a little bit and if you've watching
too long enough you'll know that I
actually started out this channel by
doing whole videos Look Books DIYs
Primark halls and shopping in vintage
stores and coming back and share with
you guys what I had and like it was
actually what I loved loved doing and
but then I kind of felt more and more
self-conscious about my body about the
way and look just more subconscious it's
so crazy
like and that and I kind of was watching
this videos like nah but you shot you
even look that bad I don't know what
your problem is and also realizing that
sometimes we can be our own worst
enemies sometimes the voices in our
heads the criticisms in our head are the
things that actually hold us back
well we don't necessarily need to do
that and like we went away and I just
had a whale of a time and I was so
concerned about wearing a two-piece I've
been like I'm not wearing two pieces
anymore I'm residing that I have to wear
you know a grand moff into it and I was
like mirrors go everywhere and I was
like you know what who bloody cares I'm
gonna wear whatever the heck I feel like
and I'm going to work it and I see as I
was watching a video that yes Patricia
yes I was enjoying my also and I
realized it's very important for you to
be able to congratulate yourself and to
give yourself that pat on the shoulder
because not everybody out there is going
to do that and there's a world where
there's enough people who maybe want to
come against you and it is important for
you to also be your own your own
cheerleader give your own self thumbs-up
and that is what I feel like I wanted to
do and I want to encourage anyone who's
out there that if you have got these
doubts and these criticisms in your head
about yourself the best thing the work
best way to face a fear is to kind of do
an act of courage and that kind of
builds up that muscle of being more
self-confident stronger happier and a
piece of yourself so yeah and no that's
a bit you know philosophical for a
lookbook
but I felt like it was something I just
wanted to say and for someone who's out
there right now so I hope you enjoyed
this video and I'll see you soon I have
another video Thursday out on a roll
listen she inside is coming there for is
come in sounds to pee some soup I'm
coming for you
so that I'll see you later i watching
for senator once a stand in the ocean i
see they both guys for change lives
inside those ocean i
no like are you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
