all about little ways that you can make
your life a little bit happier and full
of joy a lot of people look at me and
think that I am very happy and all that
kind of good stuff but happiness takes
what do you know and then I was inspired
because over the weekend I basically
went to a place called puddle town which
was transformed to puddles town but I
can't breathe because they've launched
their new chocolate called um Cadbury's
puddles and they're absolutely delicious
and basically they had a massive dark
race and they invited loads of people
over and it's a super small town but
what I noticed was that how happy and
loving and joyful and everyone was and
it was just such a nice afternoon and
once in all you've got to do things like
that and just gain some inspiration that
will make your life a little bit better
my number one tip for when it comes to
trying to feel a bit happier and having
a bit more joy in your life is to spend
that time with people and I feel like as
humans we are wired to feel better and
when we are connected with other human
beings now not all of us have the luxury
of having close friends or families by
us but that shouldn't stop us from
spending time with people as I mentioned
I went down to puddle town or should I
call it puddles town and there were so
many people there that I didn't know who
was so nice and open and everyone
gathered to basically be at this event
and in this country and I'm sure across
the world there are lots of
opportunities where people can get
together who don't necessarily know each
other and do something for the greater
good we hang around in the park or
having a town clean up all right after
the riots you know a homeless shelter
went they need lots and lots of
volunteers there's always an opportunity
to spend time with other people one
thing that can be very hard in life is
if you are lonely loneliness is super
bad and if you can get around people
even if it's a library or sitting in a
coffee shop it's really important and
will make you feel better I always find
that
when I hang around with you know random
people I sit in the coffee shop I can
just you know take in the sight and the
sound and get some inspiration and
sometimes around a person might end up
just speaking to me my second tip is to
switch off and be a bit of a hippie some
of us are super connected to our phones
and technology that we are feeling
anxiety when we stop
I found this of myself that I wake up i
scrolling on my phone know I'm on an
email and I rarely take the time to
spend some time in nature or to get out
to the countryside or spend a day away
for my laptop or computer or something
technical it's so important to spend
some time outside of the city if you can
get outside of this city or even just
get a wave form your computer and stuff
like that it's gonna be important for
you to spend some time in nature spend
some time in fresh air
spend some time doing something physical
with your hands or something like that
honestly if you can't get to the
countryside get to a local part so my
next tip is to treat yourself once in a
while not all the time you are allowed
to give yourself a little treat
meaning that you buy something that
you've wanted to buy for a long time or
you build up to you treat yourself to a
little bit of cadbury's Pardo's those
bitter chocolate here and there
everybody needs those little times in
life that just give them a little bit of
a buzz now no one's saying that you
should do it all day every day eat what
you want however you want buy all this
stuff that you can't afford but it's
really good to give yourself that uplift
once in a while and guess what you
deserve it my final tip is that
happiness is a choice I say this every
single time I read a book could hard
right and happiness and I learned lots
of different ways that you can
practically be happier one of the key
ways that you can make yourself happier
is actually just to ponder on your happy
moment there's evidence that shows that
a lot of us we remember the bad things
or things that go wrong because we are
wired that way to put
our selves so if we remember the bad
things or things that haven't been so
good it means that we protect ourselves
from it but things that are happy and
joyful they they a memory for a moment
and then they kind of dissipate into
nothing but if you can spend some time
to ponder and remember on things that
make you happy and that makes you smile
that have inspired you that are
beautiful and you keep remembering these
things all the time you become a happier
person and your happiness will radiate
to lots of people around the world and
so change the whole entire world
so guys those are my tips for little
ways that you can make your life happier
and thank you to Cadbury's for bringing
me along to puddles town it was super
inspiring and made me decide to do a
video just like this too so that
everybody can have their own puddles
town at moment so guys thank you so much
for watching and I'll catch you later
bye I have a whole video for you guys
