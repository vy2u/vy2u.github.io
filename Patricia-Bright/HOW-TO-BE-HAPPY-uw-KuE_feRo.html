on how to be happy I get up so much
about you know Patricia you're so happy
you seem like you have the perfect life
and I get these comments all the time
and sometimes I feel like cringing
because you never know what is going on
and a lot of us sit here on our social
media and you may think they've got the
perfect life they're so happy but you
never know what's going on behind closed
doors I have faced deep deep dark days
of depressions and tears and really
really bad times as well as experiencing
really really happy times as well and I
find that with happiness that it truly
comes from the inside out and takes work
so for those of you who want to know how
to be happy or how can I feel happier
and what four tips that I believe are
super useful and have definitely helped
me get out of places where I've been in
the much darker place and to where I am
hopefully today and where I plan to be
you know going forward because I'm
totally not there yet so first things
first is that happiness is a choice and
I will definitely say there are some
people who are more inclined to being
happy there are some people who are in
very very difficult situations yet
they're able to see the light at the end
of the tunnel and other people who may
have the world at their feet may feel
like you know all hell is breaking loose
but happiness is a choice which for me
made me feel very very excited because
it means that there's no reason to be
passive about it and if I take some
active steps to be happy or active steps
to control and maintain my happiness
then I can be happy I read a book by
Rick Hanson it's called hardwiring
happiness and he's the neurologist
and it basically talks about the science
of being happy and in summary have
positive experiences which you will
experience every single day right enrich
them absorb them and then link them to
negative experiences so
the negativity never feels so bad and in
reality if you make the choice to be
happy you wake up in the mornings I'm
going to be happy and now a positive
thing that happens to me today I'm going
to absorb that and revel in that you
will see that your brain will begin to
hardwire into being a lot happier
so my next tip when it comes to be happy
is to revel in the present so many of us
are so absorbed with what's going to
happen in the future
we're acquainting when this happens or
when that happens I'll be happier but
that's never going to be the case that
bench rock is going to keep keep going
going going away but if you learn to be
happy with your hair and your now and
experience those little things you will
actually be able to find joy in
absolutely anything which will make you
feel like a happier person when I was
actually trying to like prepare for this
video there was a fly buzzing and I was
like you know what I'm not even gonna
allow this fried to bug me instead I
made up a story about this fly with a
briefcase that was on his way home to
dinner but he couldn't get out of my
house
and instead I thought empathy for that
fly and I know it's weird but it's a
concept of enjoying the little moments
that you feel right here right now are
going to bring you a sense of joy and
peace and even me remembering that story
is making me like smile at myself like a
weirdo but it genuinely worse it could
be from what can I smell right now right
or how crisp the air feels or or all the
goosebumps on your body there's so many
things little things that happen to you
throughout the day that can give you so
much joy so be present and enjoy them so
the next tip that I think a lot of
people know about happiness is actually
gratitude gratitude is basically being
thankful for where you are now again
present Ness is so important but
gratitude is exactly the same thing
writing down the things that you're
happy about all thankful for or freezer
day being grateful for that time where
you walked across the road
didn't you know get knocked over even
though he wasn't looking or that you
know extra piece of fries or extra extra
chicken you got a KFC I don't know I
don't know anything about chicken but
just the little things that can make you
feel better
along with random acts of kindness as
well they are a great way to just give
back positively in the world and I
always alright you can make yourself
feel better by doing something for
someone else and not being so in Whitney
focus the fourth tip I have when it
comes to happiness is that happiness is
internal a lot this statement that you
know surround yourself with positive
people and you'll be positive or
surround yourself with the people that
make you happy and I totally agree of
being around positive and happy people
but if you look to your happiness from
the outside or external sources or what
you're gonna have well the people you're
going to be with eventually you're going
to be disappointed because everyone in
this world will fail you in reality any
human flesh will fail you because you
know I felt people peek at people for
people that is the reality of life so
once you start to realize that your
happiness doesn't have to equate to
what's going on on the outside but what
goes on the inside you know you're going
to learn to be more confident and more
happy from within yourself and you'll be
able to sit at home laughing to yourself
like a crazy person and not feel any
weight about it because your happiness
is internal realizing that or what
happens on the outside or whoever's out
there that's not gonna make any
difference with your happiness if they
like you if they don't like your he's
got that don't got that doesn't matter
start working on the inside so guys I
hope you enjoyed that video and that's
on how to be happy
I'm gonna be doing more talking videos
like this if there are any other topics
you want me to cover to chat about
I'll do my research on it and I'll get
some stuff to you I'm also gonna write
postal nests on my blog it's patricia
bright dr. dot uk' we were no bit more
detail and you know links to some more
books and some resources and some videos
that i've watched that have really
helped just enrich me on this process of
becoming happier because honestly some
people just naturally happier and in
some people it's hard work but i'm
willing to put the work in to smile
every day
so guys thank you so much for watching
and i will see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
