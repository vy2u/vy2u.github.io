horrible word I think it definitely is
and in this video we are not about to
slut sham or criticize or judge
everybody for any decisions that they
want to make however I'm not going to
sit here and write and pretend that I'm
not a teeny weeny bit tired of seeing
underboob vagina walls and and I've got
to write inside walls I'm talking about
like you know the unitard and they've
just got the Front's and everything just
on my side then I just stick to myself
in which lifestyle does everything stay
in place and it doesn't end up going to
the side just to the middle and it just
been very uncomfortable I'm tired I've
seen so many girls back back to me I'm
just like this is this is not the only
way I have a problem with that I think
it's beautiful I think gods have got
some guns but amazing bodies I wish I
could show underboob and yeah yeah it's
just not necessary me but you know what
these are not the only ways to be sexy
so if you are one of those Lindy's or
what are those women do you wanna you
know be like oh you know I'm sexy as
well you want to show that you're sexy
as well but you're like you know what my
undercarriage isn't set up in that way
or you know what thumb bikinis are
cancelled in my life then hopefully this
video to you so the number one it's
gonna be what about the self-confidence
there is nothing sexier than a confident
woman a confident man just someone who
carries themselves with a surety in
themselves in who they are and what they
stand for and how they want to be and my
you know it's all walks into the room
you can kind of sense that aura of just
self-confidence and people are drawn to
those kind of people so if you're not
confident put down to this something
that you need to work on and confidence
is one of those things that you either
kind of have to fake it or you build it
over time and you get confidence but the
more and more you do things that you're
not comfortable with but then you're
successful at them they keep doing that
that is confidence and I find that you
know what you don't have to be this
attention you might be the wallflower
you could be quietly confident it
doesn't matter but having that sense of
self a surety and beans from you and is
a very attractive she know about sexy
personal hygiene that is a very sexy
because there is nothing like seeing
someone from across the room and as they
walk closer towards you you start to
smell them and they open their mouths
and then you're shocked do that mmm it's
not sexy anymore personal hygiene is
like papi be more like number one make
sure you're fresh chilli teeth a brush
breath is good clothes are clean like
just stay fresh and and I'm like oh no
mark and I was anything about personal
hygiene is that one of the signs of
someone not being feeling so good about
themselves is that they kind of let
themselves go like they might have a
shower like once a week I don't know how
much I want to me that would be a lot
like but maybe they don't have a shower
as regularly as they would normally do
or they're just they just stink and
being stinky is not it so stay as fresh
as you can if you do like perfumes
let's find spray it up but a bit of Tom
Ford you know Black Orchid if you like
if you like to keep it natural then at
least make sure you have deodorant on it
so the next thing when it comes to being
sexy is your body language and what you
do with your body says a lot about you
and actually can affect your sex appeal
if you are working with your shoulders
down you've got feet that are heavy and
it's like you've got feet that made out
of cement all you've got sandbags on you
just kind of you know you're just like
an ogre it's not sexy like speak serious
about yourself and when I see guys
walk around like ochres or Ghassan like
babes like straightening your back up
come on
shoulders back put a little roll in
there do a little bit of a side head dip
just a little bit of something and the
best thing to do is actually to think
about your body language a lot of us
don't even think about what we're
looking like like what are you sitting
like right now you like and think about
how you stand how you move where you put
your hands how you feel how you look
kind of like cozy it's like a permanent
impose it about thinking about it like
see I'm feeling sexy it feels great you
can be casual but still sexy you know
see I got it I got it oh we're going to
go into a sensitive area however in my
opinion it isn't that sexy to have
everything on show sometimes some people
are just doing the most I am seeing
everything I can see internal organs I
just say really really and I understand
that like being nude it's great embrace
your body I will call my house naked all
the time right
and I mean I think it's a wonderful
thing but it's not every day and it's
not everything sometimes be a little bit
to the imagination because that is sexy
and I'm telling you if you saw someone
walking down the street virtually naked
why are you thinking
all that person said - you can think hmm
maybe this person isn't inspire me you
know all their that's just my two prints
on that now another way to be very sexy
is to use those eyes eyes they say on
the window to the soul and honestly if
you've ever had that moment where you
get that eye contact for like the others
either the room you get that lucky
enough like it feels you write flutters
it feels really nice those other moments
that are very very sexy because I sing a
lot without having to do very much you
know so if you can practice your I
thought she looked you're like you're
sexy look look in the mirror art it
sometime get some practice in it that's
going to make a lot of difference to
your sex appeal and I think that the
more you get used to kind of holding in
gays the better you are going to be
added now the important thing is to get
the balance right because you can look
scary
you can look scary if you are far too
busy so if you're like this it's not
sexy however feel more like you know and
you do the soft look away it's all good
so you've got to get the balance right
get in the mirror get some practice and
also add a cheeky little smell to it as
well okay so another way to be sexy is
not to be afraid of showing a little bit
of skin okay
some girls have got amazing legs I'm not
sure you have like one of those friends
in like your boobs are amazing or your
bums amazing and they're like no I don't
want to share it like girls sometimes
they let it out these you don't need to
hide your goodness from the world
sometimes it's okay to show some of
those assets that you're proud of that
look good but once in a while it's okay
to just show it a little bit of skin I
don't think there's anything wrong with
that sticking on the top or showing skin
this is an outfit option and it's like
one of my friend that's my waist for
like I say this but I love a bar go top
lobe let for me
shoulders are sexy the clavicle is like
the cleavage to me I love it and I feel
like the best thing about that Bardot is
that no matter shape size whatever I
feel like it's really flattering on
everyone if you get the right bipod on
top and it shows enough without showing
everything which is why it's literally
my favorite favorite top so my tip to be
sexy is
another way to be sexy is to brush up on
your knowledge be it your knowledge of
beauty be it your knowledge of aerospace
engineering there is nothing more sexier
than a woman or a guy who's engaged
about something having interest makes
you interesting to be sexy doesn't mean
that you have to be an airhead and I
think it's so important and the one
thing that I find very attractive in men
and women is when they've got something
to say they've got something to talk
about it can carry a conversation
they're doing it with their night all of
that is very attractive and finally
really being sexy isn't really what you
do on the outside or how everyone else
perceives you is how you perceive
yourself if you think that you are sexy
guess what you are and if you don't then
work on it spend some time with yourself
get to know yourself and learn that you
are so guys I hope you enjoyed that
video I just felt like I just wanted to
have a little bit of a chat on the topic
of being sexy because I know it's hard
it's for speaking for like you just
don't have no sex appeal if you are not
you know doing what looks very sexy but
no you have to kind of take a step back
and be like you know what this isn't the
only way to be sexy there's so many
other things that I could do that make
me make them succeed make me feel sexy
and that's really what matters so guys I
hope you enjoyed my video and in the
meantime I will see you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
