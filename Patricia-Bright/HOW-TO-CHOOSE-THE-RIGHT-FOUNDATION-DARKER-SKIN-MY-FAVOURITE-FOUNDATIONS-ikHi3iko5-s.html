am doing a really basic video for you
and i wanted to do a video all about
choosing the right foundation i know
loads of us find it a really difficult
task to do especially if you are a woman
of color and you're really dark or if
you're like just brown sometimes
especially here in the UK or if you're
like super pale you're like i can't find
anything to suit my skin so i'm going to
share some of my tips when it comes to
picking and finding the right foundation
i'm going to let you know some of my
favorite ones and some of the other and
once i've seen on the market that could
be quite nice so i hope you enjoy and
get comfortable okay so number one
before you even buy a foundation you
need to kind of work out what is your
tone and tone is completely different to
shade tone is whether or not you are
warm you're cool or you are neutral i
think that i am relatively warm so i can
look a little bit orangey underneath a
little bit ready as well sometimes and I
find that cooler foundations can make me
look ashy so you need to work out where
you sit on that spectrum if you're
neutral that's fine but you might look a
little bit better when you wear
foundations that are a little bit redder
or you might look better when you wear
foundations that are a little bit cooler
so take some time to work out what tone
you are so after that you want to work
out what your shade is now the best way
to do that is take a good look at your
skin you've got to take that makeup off
and you need to have a look and what
you'll probably notice at what what I've
noted my skin is that I am multiple
different shades and that does not
matter okay we are not all one color one
part of my face is Lad skin one poke my
face is Lupita at one part of my face is
don't know like spongebob or something
so you need to basically look at the
different parts of your face and choose
a tone I would always choose a tone that
is the majority of my face and I have a
dark area here which a lot of people
have is
like a five o'clock shadow and then I
also had like a halo that's darker
around here and then I have a lighter
area there so I choose to use my main
foundation as my darkest tone and then I
just highlight with a concealer to just
brighten up my middle area the key thing
about foundation is basically picking a
color and making your skin look a little
bit more even and flawless one of my
favorite tricks when it comes to finding
my foundation is trying three different
colors when I go to the makeup counter I
will look at the color that I thinks my
color I look then for the color that's
lighter than my color I look for the
color that is darker than my color and I
might try some of the cooler ones in
between sometimes I might try five from
the same brand and I will literally put
them on my hand and I will go about my
day so usually I buy foundation when I'm
going shopping and I would go ahead and
do my shop and then see how my makeup
has changed people say that my
foundations don't change color they do
okay all of them change color so you're
better off seeing which one fades or
dries into the color that is more
suitable for your skin tone and you can
come back and buy the foundation that
looks best on you next when it comes to
picking the right foundation is looking
at your skin type really closely there
might be a foundation that everybody is
talking about your skin type does not
rock for that if you are someone who is
oily something that is a Jewish and a
ssin or illuminating foundation is going
to have you looking like an oil slick at
the end of the day no matter how much
primer and milk of magnesia you put on
your face okay really do take into
consideration your skin type and if
you're someone with dry quite flaky skin
it's going to be really important for
you to consider what you put on your
face before you put on your foundation
and ensure that you don't go for
foundations that are mattifying or very
very heavy because they're going to
probably stick to all your dry bits so
really look at the language that is on
the bottle for instance the Giorgio
Armani luminous silk luminous silk okay
and I match
someone who's quite oily but I love this
foundation I'll use a primer but I know
on a night out I'm not putting this
foundation on because I will be glowing
I will be the disco ball at the party
okay
next when it comes to picking the right
foundation sometimes you are going to
have to mix and blend to get the perfect
color lots of people do this pro makeup
artists do this and they just work with
the different colors and they mix them
in and they make their perfect shade
there is nothing wrong with that besides
that makeup is kind of expensive and you
don't have to be buying three or four
different foundations to get your
perfect color but sometimes you can do
that to get what you need I'm going to
talk through a couple of foundations
that are my absolute favorite so first
things first is the Giorgio Armani
luminous silk everyone runs this
foundation I see why they have got
literally every skin tone the color 14
is literally like it's literally me like
they got my skin and they're like here
Patricia here's your skin I'm sure you
can see that on the back of my hand and
it is literally on unparallel in regards
to the color match towards me I just
love this foundation it is an
illuminating foundation I always use a
primer because I do get really all up
and around here I use the instant ler
from the body shop I love that but it's
a really nice and light foundation if
you want it to look like it's your skin
now another foundation that's a bit more
high end or pricey that you guys know
that I love is the Lancome ten Idol
24-hour that foundation is also another
one that's a favorite of mine and that's
the one where I did the whole testing of
three different colors I believe I'm
wearing color 13 completely different to
the luminous silk foundation in regards
to the texture but it's a really good
high-quality foundation and it gives you
a really nice coverage so this is the
foundation that I would recommend most
highly compared to all the other
foundations I've just mentioned the
foundation I am wearing today and it's
the B even oil control foundation which
is from superdrug this is a drugstore
foundation people hello and it's so good
it's so good it's so
at number one so so Matt nice coverage
and it's rich in color and I believe
they extend it I don't know if this is a
new range or they extended the range but
they've got three colors in the darker
spectrum that I can use and they've got
like you've got nineteen foundation
colours or something along the lines the
foundation is great for multiple
different skin tones the coverage on it
is amazing and it lasts all day it's the
one that I'm wearing now and I'm wearing
I believe it smoked art the color 90 are
amazing and you want my set more amazing
this is seven nine and nine seven nine
and let go by your foundation people I'm
such a sales person and other
foundations I like are from Bobby Brown
I think that if you are someone who is
really warming color or really red in
color I find that the Bobby Brown's are
amazing I used to use it but I found
that and it was getting too red on me
and it was a little bit too oily for me
but if you have dry skin I would
definitely recommend a Bobby Brown
foundation and actually I gave mine to
my mum and it looks glorious on her she
looks fabulous in it but I love their
concealers as well this is chestnut and
as a concealer palette this palette is
the palette I use basically in every
single tutorial we ever do as you can
see it gets a lot of usage there as well
so guys that is my video on foundations
and picking the right foundation for
yourself
and so my favorites I hope you found
that helpful and do let me know if you
have any other Beauty questions and
stuff we are all let you know on their
journey together I am NOT a makeup
artist I'm just an everyday girl like to
look kind of good once in a while so I
hope you'd enjoyed and I'll catch you in
my next video bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
