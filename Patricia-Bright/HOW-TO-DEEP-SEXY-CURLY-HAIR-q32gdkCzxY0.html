tutorial for you and to be honest I
haven't done a hair tutorial in a really
long time because to become like I'd
like to be as transparent as possible of
you guys I don't really like doing hair
tutorials because I really don't do very
much to my hair and I don't change it up
actually that's not true cuz I have a
friend sometimes and I have short hair
sometimes oh it's true it's true I do
change it up quite a lot but because it
changed you so much maybe that's why I
never do the Cheetos and I never really
think about it I just get really bored
and then I switch it up but a lot of
people in Instagram have been asking me
about my current hair style and I think
it's like one I've got a center part now
and I've been wearing these loose ways
which have been so easy to achieve I'm
going to show you exactly how I achieve
them it's so so easy products are so
easy I do not put anything in my hair
extensions I probably wash them about
once a month and I like it the older
that they get the more I like them in
terms of they they're less shiny and
they're they've got a little bit more
body but the one thing I do use is the
L'Oreal vivre the extraordinary oil I do
use this and I only add a very little
bit strangely enough I've gone back to
my old school Remington curling wand now
you know this has been the one but it
really does produce really nice color
ways especially of the two days so the
first thing is of it the next day oh my
gosh because it drops a bit more but
you'll see what it looks like but in two
days amazing and then I simply use my
GHD paddle brush which is amazing and my
carbon static cone amazing also from GHD
now I have a touch of leave out of my
own natural hair on the top here so I
just put a little bit of oil there to
help with the
and I literally just gently gently
gently and these colors are about four
days old is my hair right now so I just
take these and do them backwards so as I
said these are so easy to do I just use
my curling wand and I always call
backwards and in the same direction
because it will give me a nice connected
way probably takes about 20 minutes to
do this all over so that is the curling
part over actually I'm going to use
another brush I'll show you it instead
I'm going to use my carbon anti-static
comb the reason I comb it out is because
I don't want the rim knit cars but I
love this comb because it really does
stop my hair from kind of separating you
getting too bushy but it kind of
stretches them out so they're not like
real nails
so guys that is my finished look this is
part of basically the room with her the
whole time I absolutely love it it's
super easy and quick to do and the great
thing about like doing the waist like
this is that you can wear them for like
four days and then they cus just slowly
drop so right now this is quite both day
shift but after that we drop right and
then it will look just so effortless
which I love yeah I've got really long
hair into the completely honest review
but it was a nice change after the short
hair I felt like a bit of a grandma with
my fringe and stuff and I found that for
me I'm just waiting at this hair I'm
just some weighing in love this all
right somewhere again but anyway I
wasn't gonna say cotton was good say
yeah but the fringe and stuff I found
that it was just it was just too much
effort for me and it looked nice in
pictures and stuff if you saw me walking
down the street it was like cut and part
and I just looked so so straight and I
just think you know what this is I'm not
about that cut and cut in hairdo life
guys so yeah that's it so unless I hoped
you enjoyed that video cuz if you want
to see more like hair tutorials and
stuff then let me know that's my phone
going off so it's time I got but I'll
see you guys later and
I hope you enjoy the game</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
