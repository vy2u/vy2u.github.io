the autumn season and I love it
I'm so happy that it's autumn and some
of you might think I'm crazy
some of you get this you know if your
winter baby like me you probably get
this totally but I don't rent the summer
so um yeah the full autumn you see I was
about to say fall and I was like I'm
gonna get in trouble if I say fall sorry
guys YouTube makes me do it with all my
American subscribers hey girls hey so
guys today I'm styling something that I
absolutely love it is the high-waisted
skinny jean but these are amazing for
absolutely every single body shape now
girls I'm an apple I know some of you
guys may not agree but I'm totally an
apple got a little bit pouch I don't
have any hips and you have a bit of a
behind but hips not our girls but I
completely love a high-waisted skinny
jeans and I thought to myself you know
what they're going to be gauze with all
those different types of body shapes you
probably don't think that they can wear
them but you totally can so I have got
notebook note for time girls
so get a cup of tea I don't know where
my cup of tea is I don't have my cup of
tea right here right now but don't worry
we'll just get to this so first things
first you want to make sure that you
have the absolute perfect skinny jean
mine are from M&amp;amp;S who do amazing
high-waisted skinny jeans they're
gorgeous they're perfect at the waist
for me and I love the fact that they're
nice and skinny all the way to the ankle
and that graze it perfectly to
definitely shop around and just find
that perfect skinny jean it's worth the
investment first thing let's look like
the girls with the triangle shape you
know they have tripod shape you know
you've got some broad shoulders and
you're always trying to think now I can
never wear a strappy top yes don't worry
girls
you can wear high raceless skinny jeans
they're totally going to work for you
and they're going to make your legs look
luscious my suggestion is to maybe just
cover up your shoulders with like a
blazer with like peplum and like
something sim
cool watch shows a little bit of
cleavage and then let your legs do the
talkin and with a high-waisted skinny
jean and you can wear like kills as well
just to make you look even more family
so the next shape is those of you who
are pear-shaped you know you've got
broad broad hips and maybe a big behind
your much smaller on top and you know
you have pairs who are like big you've
pairs who are like small you have all
ends of the spectrum I think the key
thing is is that it helps to kind of
smooth those hips interpolation so just
contain them a little bit sometimes they
want to run a little bit well and they
totally help me to kind of contain
everything and I think it just gives a
really nice silhouette pairing it with
like a top that shows off your shoulders
and shows off a little bit of cleavage
is a really way to kind of draw
attention to your face region and make
everything look a little bit more
balanced and finally you can probably
top it off with like a long 9 jacket
that stands out and just brings
everything a little bit more in so next
those of you who are straight up and
down you look like a letter one know
number one or the letter i' is it
totally straight up and down
now that is totally the model thicker
come on right and they have legs for
days just literally gallivanting like
some kind of gazelle in the Serengeti or
something like that those legs look
absolutely amazing the only thing you
probably want to do is add a little bit
more volume to yourself I think the main
thing to do is go for like a nice chunky
knit or something like that
that adds a little bit more volume on
your top half and you can rock a flat
shoe or a hill it doesn't matter your
legs look amazing so next it's the girls
like means that Apple girls the guys
have got that little bit of a belly not
much on the hip Department and just are
a little bit round in the middle that's
what I am high-waisted jeans to the
rescue whoa hey they are going to add
some more shape to that region okay
they're going to suck you in on the
stomach and just make your legs do the
talking okay it's going to kind of push
you in and then create something that
either
you know lack of hips is not the best
look in the world but you know you can't
win them all and I love to wear like a
like a long t-shirt or something like
that and layer it with like a little
cropped jacket like I've got here and
finally you guys with the hourglass
shape you've been blessed cause you were
blessed it is literally the perfect
figure everyone loves the hourglass so
you show it off with a high-waisted jean
you can totally wear like a little croc
without showing too much that no one
ever wants to see belly button really
like you can wear your high-waisted
skinnies and little crop top and just
look gorgeous show that hourglass figure
off but if you want to be a little bit
modest throw something on but just show
that a little bit of Binnorie you might
as well it probably looks perfect so
guys that is how I like to star my
favorite object in my closet which is
the high waist skinny jeans and I'm
gonna do more styling series like this
hopefully four different body types and
maybe I'll get people who have different
body types to show how they start with
their body types I think that's a good
idea actually I like that but sorry I
just hadn't moved there anyway guys I
hope you enjoyed watching and I will see
you later bye
heavily lacking in the trouser
Department don't say I'm lucky in the
trouser Department that sounds like
you're lacking in the trouser Department</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
