for you I've just done a new weave and I
really wanted to try something a little
bit different could you guys know that I
wear my hair too straight I'm one of
those people well I like easy breezy
simple I haven't got time for curling
and tongue in and blend blip in the
morning not art not me and just brush
and go I found these things on ebay and
I'm going to put them in a description
bar below and they're absolutely amazing
like if you want to get these really
cool loose curls these achieve that and
you can do it overnight or in a couple
of hours and i'll show you how i did
them in a video so guys this is a super
easy tutorial and i love soup it easy so
my hair starts off like really straight
cuz my hair extensions are straight and
I'm in the bathroom because I need
access to water if you've got a spray
bottle that should be absolutely fine so
I section off quite large sections of my
hair because I want quite deep waves and
I just brush through them and add some
water to get my hair a little bit down
because it means that the cold will last
a lot longer so this is my curling
implement I'm sure you can make
something like this at home so what I do
next is I just wrap my hair nice and
tightly around the wires
and then to secure the edges you just
kind of flap down both sides and that
keeps it in place I then go ahead and
section yeah parts of my hair actually
do this in six sections in the night but
I flap those down and this is so easy to
do before bed if you want waves in the
morning super quick there's no science
to it so when you're done you can just
leave these overnight and go to bed you
might want to put a head scarf on it's
not the most attractive thing in the
world but grow your hands go be good in
the mole in so ones already come out and
you can see i miss the little bit I'll
just blend that into the rest of my hair
and i literally just unravel these and
just feel if they're dry if they're not
dry you can probably just mix the blow
dryer over it for split second you can
see it produces these gorgeous like
waves
so I just move on to the other side and
you can create it very proud of myself
with this hair so when you're done with
taking them out you just want to tease
tease tease if you brush this you're
going to get kind of more the bouncy big
wavy hair if you don't use a brush you
can have these kind of curls so I tease
and tease till I think it looks
different it usually doesn't to be toty
on this but that's my end result these
cute ways so the guys thank you for
watching and I hope it gave you a quick
idea on a way to curl your hair heinous
knee and make sure you subscribe if
you're not subscribed already and follow
me on instagram and facebook see you
guys later bye
I'll say it
we have led me to where I have here
today so I'm just going to tell you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
