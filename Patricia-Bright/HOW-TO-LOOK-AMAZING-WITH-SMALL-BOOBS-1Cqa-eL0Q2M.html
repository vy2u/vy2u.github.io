on the ever popular subject of boobs
boobs boobs boobs boobs boobs you know
in the world that we live in today we
can't get on a bus without seeing a pair
of boobs poking at us and they're just
boobs everywhere and we love them they
are gorgeous they are squidgy they are
warm they are lovely we've got a bit of
boobs as well but for the girls who
don't necessarily have huge boobs and
I'm going to get surgery you know it's
hard to feel kind of feminine or
comfortable and especially if you're a
young girl your turn to grow up and like
oh I don't have big boobs I'm not
developed yet or you just don't get big
boobs like people like me oh then
there's ways to look gorgeous and to be
proud of yourself
and maximize all your other assets
besides your boobs so in this video I'm
going to show you a few other ways to
maximize your boobie boobie looseness
and just maximize your gorgeousness
through other ways so my number one tip
is to try and work out the figure that
you want to show and the most feminine
figure there is is basically a figure of
a and you can create this illusion by
wearing skirts that are really high and
that come out and you guys know I love a
high waist because it cinches you in
which makes you look bigger at the top
and if you wear something that comes out
it makes you look like a figure eight
and that's a really feminine and
sumptuous figure shape
so number to show other bits of your
body and I think they're enough to be
cleavage I think that the shoulder is a
very sultry and just sexy part of a
woman and you don't need to have boobs
but everyone has a shoulder a bit of
shoulder to shake that looks gorgeous
bit of shoulder high way skirt you're
good to go
so high neck tops I actually think that
high neck tops are beautifully elegant
and that she will create more volume on
the top and will give you a rounder
shape especially if you wear a good bra
and also if you can show a bit of back
cleavage then you're good to go really
you
and finally I would literally go with
some colors some shapes and patterns and
stripes especially I love stripes
because these literally take away
distract from the fact that they may not
be so much there on the top but having
you know that shape and size and
movement will ritually look gorgeous and
you'll look beautiful in it
so I must say I'm not a booby hater I
love boobies wish I had a bit more but
for girls who don't have them understand
that you can embrace the way you look
and flaunt it for that shoulder from
that back foot pose and legs you have
other assets and never feel like oh my
god I don't have huge boobs you're
gorgeous - anyway so thanks for watching
guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
