dollars maybe a million dollars hello
beautiful people welcome to my channel I
hope you are doing well we are coming to
the end of 2017 and boy has it been a
year I would honestly say on my channel
it has been the year of I spent of ok
the last six months that is what we've
done and we've gone on to different
shopping websites and you know just
seeing what was out there you know we
spent a lot we spent a little we've got
onto cheap websites you've gone into
more expensive websites and it's been
really interesting to see right but you
know what
going into 2018 one of my resolutions is
to save money I'm not gonna I think to
save money I need to save money we all
need to save money but some of us we
still want to look good you know bushi
how do we maintain that boogy you know
high-end look while being on a budget so
today I wanted to do a little start
video before we get into the new year
and I'm gonna show you how to look
Beauty sophisticated sophisticated on a
budget if you're not already subscribed
do subscribe and if you're not following
my social join the gang during the
family right let's get into this video
okay so my tip number one for looking a
million dollars is to keep a little bit
more covered up I know this is hard for
people in 2017 going on 18 but I feel
like there's this air of mystery when
you cover up a little bit more and I'm
hoping as we go into a new year like
girls will start embracing just you know
covering up we don't want to see your
kidneys and your internal organs that we
don't need to see you all leave a little
bit to the imagination and I was
probably like your oversized jumper like
this one this is from Schick wish and
it's so gorgeous I love the texture I
love the color I love the fit I love the
feel there's nothing wrong with showing
you know we say this nipple to the wind
you know free the nipple like we're good
with that that's fine but there's
something also really nice about not
showing everything and having an air of
mystery and an oversized jump like this
polo neck and oversized listen we're
covering it all up it's an honor
up in here and we still look cute and
bougie while we do it okay so I swear
this has been me so maybe I've always
been bougie hello it's got to be dainty
jewelry you guys know for the past four
so yes I actually haven't worn earrings
I don't really like how I look with
earrings on and I think when you're
trying to look you know a little bit
more put together like you got a little
bit of crying and a bougie you want to
just you know pair back a little bit
maybe that's a British thing right
you'll see rich people here and you
never know they've got even a million
pounds in their back they'll be wearing
a hobo t-shirt and you will never know I
also kind of appreciate that and really
enjoy that but when it comes to the
jewelry sometimes it can be a bit big or
a bit garish but if you want to have
that kind of sophisticated look I'm
going to keep it nice and dainty and I
even put in earrings today just to show
like you can wear I can wear some other
jewelry as much as I really don't like
wearing earrings if it's tiny like this
I'm done I come down to the small stuff
like this and you guys always ask me
about my little necklaces that I wear so
my favorite place is in the stoma and I
also like um Monica Vander for just
dainty jewelry they kind of kill it and
I love it this this is so me and it's to
have that coat that bangs your outerwear
is your entire outfit especially if you
live in a country where it's cold right
it's cold we live in our coats so
finding a really nice tailored coat or
like a wrap up coat that has a story or
so that says something you can find
something that wraps up and looks really
sophisticated and even if your outfit
underneath is a hundred percent Primark
or really cheap or some basic stuff from
Topshop but your jacket on the outside
it looks like it cost a million bucks
even if it didn't that's a really nice
way to look more put together bougie and
all that jazz for me a good coat is
everything I have a full wardrobe
dedicated to jackets because you can put
the nicest outfit on and then you put on
some random jacket and you look like you
found all instead you go outside
shivering because you like you know all
my jackets were my outfits so if you can
find a really nice jacket that's going
to like
elevate your look or bring your look
entirely together
the next tip is a really easy one and it
doesn't have to be designer but it is to
always have a pair of dark glasses but
be careful you don't necessarily need to
be wearing glasses at night I hate when
people in sunglasses at night however
you know a pair of dark shades somehow
kind of elevate your look and make you
look like you're a little bit more
expensive now I'm not gonna like these
are like some old-school sanding glasses
I'd pick these up in a sale like years
years back and these like my collection
and whenever I wear a dark pair of
shades like this I literally feel like
you can't tell me anything I'm bushi yes
there's something about dark glasses
that give you that air of mystery and
just that air of you know you don't need
to see what eye bags I have going on
behind here and you don't necessarily
need to buy designer sunglasses I just
say keep them really simple and really
dark and I feel like they automatically
make you look like you've got some extra
coin okay so next up the thing I think
always looks classy always looks a
little bit you know more put together
and it's the all-black look if you're
someone who's really not that stylish
and you're like you know I cannot find
yourself an all-black outfit just keep
it super simple from top to toe keep it
black you know and I said this before
you can get like a pot of red or a pop
of color on your lips just to make you
look like you try a little bit more but
I feel like black is the most of the
slimming flattering and just bougie
shade of all shades so rock it and rock
it well and I do think you can change
your Footwear to take like a all-black
boring outfit from drab to fab so you
know I might wear something like skinny
jeans and like a cardi eye throughout
the day as with some trainers and then
at night you know I put on some heels
that are black with some shame and then
you know that's elevated a very very
simple and easy look it's so darlings I
say this all the time if you ain't got
boobies you got shoulders hello do the
shoulder shake clavicle is cleavage okay
this is a little bit of cleavage or
something
very elegant and gorgeous about the
shoulder this is like a little cardigan
which I've just wrapped over and I've
just put a belt on just I can wear it
off the shoulder like this and I just
feel like there's something so gorgeous
about shoulders and very elegant and
very feminine and very kind of like what
I call it like you know dancing like
about the shoulder seat look at my move
I like the show I think you definitely
need something in your wardrobe that
shows a little bit of clavicle a little
bit of shoulder it's gonna make you look
at elegant classy and just fantastical
and I find it to be a very feminine look
and especially if you don't want to show
like boobs and legs and that stuff just
just show shoulder now do not forget
darlings let's just let's just this
never forget just a little bit of
highlight goes a long way goes a long
way on making that clavicle look a
little more prominent and gorgeous okay
so next up it's got to be another
accessory and it's got to be the Hat I
have become more and more of a hat girl
and my hat collection is actually
growing and I get hats um-hmm
or I buy them online on like Amazon and
I always tried to find myself like a hat
like this especially if it's in the tan
color there's just something about a
good hat that makes you just look put
together sophisticated and like you
actually care about your physical
appearance to be honest when I'm wearing
a hat it's because my wig is not late
but you nobody needs to know that they
just need to know that I look good I
look sophisticated and it's like girl
where did you get your hat from it's a
great idea to look around and find
really cute hats they're really
affordable
if you can get a felt one this is from
H&amp;amp;M love it it makes such a difference
to your look and just brings everything
together and makes it look like you
tried and if you're going to get one get
one in black get one in tan get one in
braids
how much do I look like I'm worth a
million dollars baby a million dollars
okay so for those of you who the year
was good and you have a little bit of
coin or you saved up and you want to
spend on like a bag or something
designer
my advice is one if you can possibly
wait wait until Black Friday or sales
time to not to necessarily buy the
trendiest item from the designer that
you want because as soon as it's a trend
is as soon as it will not be a trend
anymore and rather I do think it's a
good idea to go into that the designer
store have a look around and see if
there's an alternative item that you
feel genuinely fits your wardrobe and
your personality so that you won't want
to wear it just because it's a trend but
you'll work because it felt right for
you and that happened
we've mean this year I bought a little
bit of a treat this year I bought myself
this blue Vuitton of Victoria which
isn't the most trendy of Lily Vuitton
bags but I first swear I instantly saw
it in the store nice I really really
like that bag and I haven't seen anyone
with it and I just liked it as I thought
like it suited me
I wanted a bag with a little bit of
color I don't have any Louboutin we've
like the monogram print on it this is
not the most popular Vuitton bag but I
felt like I had a heart draw towards it
versus it being the trendiest bag
because trust me as soon as something is
a trend it's as soon as it isn't a trend
and then you feel like you've wasted
your money finally a little beauty tip
is to always have the nails looking on
point not that that always happens to me
not that everybody had the time or the
money to go and keep getting their nails
done like if you can that's a great way
to of course look manicured and really
nice and put together but if you don't
press-ons are absolutely amazing and
this year I will press on a lot I'm not
going to lie this is why I have a drawer
filled with press-ons so for the days
that these snap off or break or they
look chipped and broken down I sit down
it takes 15 minutes to just you know
press on nails you can go for something
a classic French tip I love these love's
these are like like a dramatic pair
these are like fake Superdrug own brand
but Harry Harlan have some and one now
so some great ones they've got plain
ones like this we can go ahead and put a
color on top and if you want to look
bougie you need to go for the nudes and
the classics I love now sinks they've
got this really cute collection these
are the caffeine hit made but neutrals
and really nice Pink's so realistically
your now--so can always look on point
and they don't have to cost a lot of
money okay guys so that is it for me as
we step into 2018 make sure you're
staying bougie and on a budget we don't
need to waste money okay we're gonna
save this year we're gonna get our point
up and we're gonna invest in ourselves
but you know we still need to look
absolutely put together and fantastic so
guys I hope you enjoyed that video if
you have any other tips for looking
amazing on a budget do let me know in
the comments and thank you so much for
watching thank you so much for
supporting me this year and lots of love
and I will see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
