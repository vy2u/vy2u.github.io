pay this weekend I'm playing around guys
so today I wanted to do a video on how
to look expensive even when you are dead
broke and I feel like looking expensive
is definitely different for everyone
there are some people who think they
look expensive and really they look
cheap in some people's eye and some
people look at someone I think they look
quite cheap but actually they might be
really rich so it's all relative but I
feel like there are a few key simple
things that every girl can do to look
that little bit more expensive now you
don't have to do these and look
expensive is not you know the beyond and
all of life before anyone wants to like
shoot me but you know some of us like to
look you know like a million bucks even
if we only have like one pound in the
bank before I get started if you are not
already subscribed to my channel please
make sure you can subscribe it's very
easy to do you just have to press the
little red button and it is free and
also if you like videos like this please
give this a thumbs up and I'll be doing
more you know invitee style videos that
I actually love doing this so let's get
started
the first thing when it comes to looking
expensive is to have your hair and your
makeup done in a way that is appropriate
when I see a girl whose hair is like
sleek tight in order her makeup is
smooth and chewy and not overdone
beautiful and blended that already is
going to make you look expensive French
women focus on their like skincare or
they use on their face and really this
is the first step to beauty if you can
have your hair and your makeup in a way
that's quite elegant so sleek to tie
back you're already going to look like a
million bucks so my second tip when it
comes to looking expensive is to wear
nudes nudes Browns blushes Pink's all of
these are a really feminine color and
there's so many that suit so many skin
tones and I find that there's something
about nude that just just has that extra
bit of elegance
and I don't know it just looks very
feminine very rich and if you can get it
in the nice plush phablet that's amazing
as well I've got this really nice new
jacket from wherever and I think this is
just the perfect thing to just put over
some basics and if you can go for like a
new jacket or a camel hat these colors
are very expensive-looking colors so my
next tip when it comes to looking
expensive is to wear a color trio and I
think the ultimate color trio is
basically black white and blue there's
something about this combination that is
very simple very pared back very model s
and very expensive I think the reason
being is that if you've got a clean
white top a really nice slick black
jacket and the perfect pair of blue
jeans you just look put together without
even trying and there's a lot of people
who this is their daily uniform and they
pair it with some boots or some heels
and you can look really put together if
you've got a little bit of money and you
want to buy into a designer but you
can't necessarily afford that designer
rather than going for the three thousand
pounds in our bag or the two thousand
pound Gucci bag potentially you might
want to buy something that's entry level
into the brand so currently the Gucci
belts are absolutely popping because
they are like 200 pounds 250 pounds I
can wear them with everything whether
it's a Hermes scarf or saline glasses or
you know a Chanel ribbon something along
those lines even if you want to buy a
perfume of a brand just so you can bite
into it so I remember my mom she always
used the bright idea and perfume every
Christmas because she couldn't exactly
by Dior but because she wanted to just
have a little something expensive in her
collection she would always buy herself
that deal or perfume if you can get the
entry-level products and wear them well
it's a great way to look expensive
without having to spend you know for the
premium prices in the collection so my
next tip when it comes to looking
expensive is to wear all of one color
and all white is clearly like you know
you got money because white is just one
of those awful colors that people like
me cannot keep clean but if you can do
all one color so
or black or white or denim or nude or
pink something about wearing all one
color just looks a little bit really put
together and really classy and I think a
white blazer and jeans and little white
t-shirt is a really easy way to do it my
next tip when it comes to looking
expensive is to wear turtlenecks and
jumpers that are wrong next and one of
the tricks that a lot of women or people
with money do is they don't show
everything and I think covering up is
like the new showing it all out likes
not everyday cleavage it's not every day
boobie Sunday's you know hide that neck
and save it for someone special if
that's your kind of thing and I feel
like turtlenecks always look like you
are pristine or you are you know put
together really well and I love this
turtleneck dress but I like you know
black turtlenecks Navy turtlenecks and
camel turtlenecks they are really
gorgeous and elegant looking and now I
said simple and paired that makeup is
always a way to look expensive but
another contradiction to that is the red
lip if you wear all black and the red
lip you're going to look like a million
bucks there's something about a go in a
red lip and I could black blazer who
just looks like oh just like gorgeous
and elegant and like she's got a lot of
money in the bank but this is the tip
I'm going to throw in that I don't
normally do but it's to wear things that
are irons and pressed I'm not gonna like
I hate I mean I tried to buy anything
that's going to be iron free and the
front think something's going to crease
easily I just I just leave on the rail
because I know I'm not the kind of girl
to iron but if you have your stuff
ironed and pressed automatically you're
going to look way more expensive way
more like you've put a lot of effort
into what you're wearing and it makes a
hell of a lot of different to an outfit
finally if you are someone who can't
necessarily afford to buy expensive
stuff all the time but if you're wasting
a lot of money on cheap rubbish and
basically you're going to end up wasting
a lot of money and I think it's really
important to invest into your stand-up
pieces very nice code or a really nice
bag or something so guys those are some
of my tips when it comes to looking
expensive if you guys have any
other tips only things that you like to
do or you don't even think it's
important to look expensive or there's
