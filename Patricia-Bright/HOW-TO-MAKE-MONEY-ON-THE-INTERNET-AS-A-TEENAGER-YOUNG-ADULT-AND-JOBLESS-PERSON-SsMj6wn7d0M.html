hey guys welcome to my channel I hope
you up all well I am very excited today
I really wanted to do this video for a
while last year I actually did a video
on how not to go broke and to save money
I'm gonna link that below because I
really feel like it's still super
valuable but today I wanted to give you
guys some tips and tricks for making
money online because I know it is hard
out here sometimes and I know not
everyone has a job and I know that
sometimes you just need to make some
extra cash flow for the weekend
and I feel like money something that a
lot of people don't really like to talk
about I feel like it's a little bit of a
trick to kind of let those that are in
the know keep name but people who don't
know are never allowed to know and I
don't think it's fair and I think we
should all eat and I think we should all
grow and I think we should all be open
to opportunity and information is power
so today I'm going to share what I know
about making money on the internet that
anybody and everybody can do so number
one its YouTube as you can see I am a
YouTube creator and I am able to make a
living doing this now obviously I have
quite a few subscribers and we thank God
but anybody can start a YouTube channel
you do not need money to start a YouTube
channel you do not need a network or
special account to start a YouTube
channel all you need is a camera and
some I DS if you've got any form of
ideas that you feel like you want to
share with the world YouTube is a great
way to monetize that when I started on
YouTube almost over five years ago I
never made a single penny because there
was no form of monetization for three
years I did youtube without making any
earnings but I was passionate about it
so I do think it's really important that
if you are going to start a YouTube
channel make sure it's not just about
making money because it's not a quick
moneymaker but it's maybe about sharing
your passions but you can definitely do
that how it works when it comes to
monetization is literally you make
videos and there are ads that run
against your videos the more people that
watch your videos
more money you make on your ads it's as
simple as that YouTube share the money
with Google I believe and Adsense and
then you get a share of that money as
well you can get popular videos by doing
stuff that is trending like celebrity
gossip or celebrity news or breaking
news from wherever you are in the world
as well as doing videos on products that
you like maybe entertaining people what
will happen is that you will have a
channel and YouTube will say you I
believe you're actually able to monetize
straight away when I started you had to
have like two thousand views or
something before you can monetize which
is what I never monetize for so long but
you can monetize straight away and what
you'll see is when you reach over sixty
pounds you'll begin to receive money
into your bank account that you set up
where your adsense account if you want
more information that you can Google
Adsense and how it actually works and
create yourself an adsense account after
that it's also blogging and a writing
content similar to YouTube in that is
you're producing your own content based
on information writing a blog is a great
way to also do that and the same
mechanism is Adsense as well if you
write content that is relevant then you
also get ads that come up beside your
blog besides your written content or
images and you'll be able to make money
if you want to promote that stuff then
social media is a great way to do that
so another way to make money is
affiliate linking if there is a website
that you like or a product that you like
online you can use sites such as
Skimlinks
rewards style and I believe there's one
called ad network I can't quite remember
and what happens is that every time
someone buys from that link it might be
your ante it might be your friend it
might be your followers you are able to
make a small Commission on that link now
a lot of people do this on Twitter and
for instance I also will say I buy this
necklace from necklace from Urban
Outfitters and I will share a link with
you that is an affiliate link so that I
make you know 20 P on you buying the
necklace but if I get 20 people make
doing that then how much money did I
make was make
Galatians 20 P times 24 pounds for power
yeah I'll make four pounds on that so I
know that sounds it's not that much
money but it can actually build up you
can link electronics you can link home
where there's so many things that you
can link and if you like searching the
web for really nice and cool products
and you want to share that with your
friends or your family or your social
network then you can definitely do it
however I wouldn't advise just putting
links out and saying by this link I
think it has to be links that are
associated to what you do or what your
friends and your family actually want to
see from you usually a lot of these
accounts work by your threshold and but
I think anyone can set it up if you have
a blog or an email address and then they
will sign you up to their network and
you will be able to log in and start
sharing your links of your friends and
your followers so after that if you want
to make money it's all about selling
your skill if you are good at something
you should try and make money on it
there are sites that I like such as
people per hour
this is a site that I go to all the time
when I'm looking for a graphic designer
when I'm looking for an editor when I
want a logo made or a banner made I go
onto then I'll say graphic designer and
lots of people around the world are
sharing their skills they're able to
make money from the comfort of their own
home by providing me a service based on
what they actually know how to do I've
actually seen there are people can buy
an hourly of a guy who looks like mr. t
and he says happy birthday so you did it
will do whatever he sells that for a
hundred and fifty pounds and will say
happy birthday Michael
cuz he looks like mr. t if you are good
at writing if you're good at taking
photos if you are good at Photoshop
people are out there looking for your
skills and looking for your services you
can make some money while doing it and
people put hours just one of the sites
that I know that does that and there may
be many others and I'm also going to
link everything in the description bar
below so that you guys have some good
insight into it so next if you can
create a product it is a great way to
make some money I've told you guys this
story
many times but is one of the ways that I
made money when I was a teen I used to
braid hair at lunch time and I used to
have like leave school like ten pounds
each day that's like 40 pounds a week
and for a thirteen-year-old that's a lot
of money so if you have a product or a
skill or something that you can sell to
friends and family or to a community
then make some money on it you don't
need to make 5,000 pounds every day you
can make 50 pounds or 10 pounds or 5
pounds but it all adds up another site
that I really like is teespring if you
have a design and you can create a
design on teespring and then you can um
sell that design so I'm thinking about
doing t-shirt as I I don't want the fuss
of packaging it and selling it and doing
it all myself I might just use teespring
to do it so you also probably want to
have like a closet clear out I'm sure
you know of a bunch of stuff that you've
got in your house or in your closet that
you're not even using anymore
go through have a clear route and sell
it online depop is an app that I really
like for selling clothes it's for
fashion-forward people bloggers and all
that kind of stuff there forever on
there selling stuff selling their old
clothes or swapping it out so finally
you can also take online surveys there
are lots of different survey companies
out there where people want your opinion
one of the survey companies that I have
talked about many times is Opinion
Outpost basically all it is is companies
and brands such as Amazon or Apple or I
don't know t-mobile or something lots of
these different brands want to know your
opinion on their product or their
services and you can do this from the
comfort of your bed at home basically
fill in a form say how many times you
use your phone a day and you can make
money while doing it now somewhere like
Opinion Outpost they give you vultures
gift cards coupons they also have a
quarterly prize draw of $10,000 as well
and it is free to join up and you can
receive an email into your Gmail and
surveys are a great way to make a little
bit of extra money online if you're just
like I'm sitting at home rather than
wasting time on Tumblr or Twitter you
can be
making money okay so guys I really hoped
you enjoyed that video and it gave you
some ideas on how to actually make some
money online I know it is hard out there
and I know that a lot of people don't
share this information and I have no
problem sharing I think sharing is
caring or need to grow and develop and
I'm definitely here for like giving all
the information I have I'm also going to
be doing my life chat today I'm so
excited about it it's at 8 o'clock
tonight I'm gonna link it below and I
don't know we're going to talk about so
Nev a comment if there's anything you
know you want to talk about let me know
I'm going to do it but I'm going to see
if this can be a regular thing so thank
you for watching guys and I'll see you
all later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
