people mistake your face for a pillow
well today we have a few solutions for
you well you could try rolling the fat
off the rolling pin
doesn't your head feel so much smaller
you could also try strenuous exercise
this is a great way to get fit and
reduce your head size
or I can just use makeup this is my
favorite way to make my face look a
little smaller there are two ways that
this can be done basically you can
lighten up or you can darken down for
contouring first of all I start off with
my foundation just to create my face
just as normal what I do is apply a
concealer which is two shades lighter
than myself and I kind of create a V
under my cheekbones and make sure that I
blend in as you don't want to look like
a streaky face guys you're just gonna
have to trust me and how amazing this
process is so next up I use a blusher
and I'm using my brushes from Sedona
lace these are amazing I love the shape
these are really good for applying blush
in the right way I've also worked out
how to use this fan brush it's great for
highlighting highlighting is essential
in creating a smaller face again a
highlight above my cheekbone and just
below it as well and I follow through
and highlight the rest of my face and
get it all perfect hopefully you can see
my face looks a little smaller some next
way is to darkened down this is the most
common way of doing it and it's by
applying a darker shade to yourself and
applying it underneath your cheekbones
and applying it at your temples in kind
of a c-shape motion and definitely thus
this will make your face look a lot
smaller and it's really easy
again I highlight just above my
cheekbones and blend it all in and I'm
done and that's how I make my face look
a little smaller thanks for watching
guys
how you gonna just rip my hair out
