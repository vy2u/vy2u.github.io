pounds that you have fretted away on
your belly hey guys welcome back to my
channel today we have another virgin
journaled and I know you guys have been
waiting on this one and today we are
talking money and how to get your money
in check so you better get yourself a
cup of tea and a note pad for sure
because I have really another hole stop
here for you guys to see and I'm not
going to lie money is actually topic I
really like talking about if you don't
know in my previous life I worked in
banking I worked in finance and I
studied accounting and Finance so it's a
topic that I really really like and I
think it's really important for young
people and just people to know and in
schools for some reason they don't tell
you about money why but they teach you
about the Treaty of Versailles right how
about the Treaty of Versailles but yet
you don't know how to manage your bank
account why is that but today I'm going
to talk about lots of different things
specifically about getting your money in
check versus how to actually like make
more money and I think I'm going to talk
about money in segments potentially more
on my blog because it's such a big big
subject and I'm going to just tell you
things that can apply to everyone no
matter what stage of life you are
currently in and even if you are young
or if you're like me you've got a
mortgage and multiple mortgages and
multiple businesses there's definitely
different things that might apply to you
but these ones here should be easy for
everyone so if you want to know how to
get your money in check I hope this
video is useful to you so when it comes
to getting your finance in check the
first thing you want to do is to check
your credit and when I was younger
credit was not something that I thought
about but it's one of those things that
impact you in the long run so even if
you are 1718 right now knowing what your
credit status if any is a really really
important
I know people who might have taken out
my cast or card when they were like 18
yeah then idea of a store card sure I
open up a store card but actually I know
someone who didn't pay their store car
and when they came
two years later or three years later to
get a loan to pay for their master's
degree they were not able to because
they defaulted on payments and it's
and it had impacted their credit score
and credit score basically impacts your
ability to get a mortgage to get a loan
if you wanted to start the business the
impacts your ability to get a car if you
want to get a car on finance and in some
cases credit scores can even impact
employment so it's something to
definitely keep on top of the best way
is to basically check what your credit
score is there's an amazing site called
credit Sesame which you guys in the US I
think in some other countries can use
which basically allows you to check your
credit score you can get credit analysis
and this is obviously free you get lots
of information on a monthly basis you
can also get free ID protection which is
worth about $50,000 and if you don't
know identity theft is a big thing and
really can impact your credit score as
well so number two what you want to do
is build your credit now this is if you
have no credit at all which is my case
when I was younger or if you have bad
credit so if you have defaulted on a
mobile phone payment a store card alone
a credit card or anything like that and
there's a few simple ways that you can
actually improve your credit but firstly
check out your credit rating right know
what that is right
but one of the simple things that you
can do is get yourself on the electoral
roll so if you're someone who might be
student and you are not registered to
vote register to vote because it gets
you on the system and that's really
really important number two is if you
are kind of registered at multiple
different addresses so your mum's house
student house your student halls someone
else's address is cut that out if you
can just keep all your mail or your
bills going to say your parents house or
one address that's going to look good on
your credit score number three is if you
have a lots of different credit cards or
credit loans get one credit card if you
can and pay all of them off and then
manage that one credit card
I don't suggest getting out lots of
different credit cards or anything like
that or lots of different loans just get
one that you can manage quickly and
easily and what I do is I have one
credit card and I have a direct debit
from my savings account which pays off
in full every single month my credit
balance and for those of you who don't
have credit you have to build credit so
you need to either get a credit card if
you can or get out something like a
mobile phone contract if you have one
and just make sure you pay it regularly
and continuously do not allow yourself
to default on any payment so don't spend
more than you can afford
just because it's on credit and always
try and pay the full balance every
single month rather than just the
minimum because in the end you're going
to be paying interest that you don't
need to pay so tip number 3 is to
monitor your accounts if you are not
doing this already I don't know why you
are not most banks have a banking app
and it's a great way basically just to
look at what you are spending on a daily
basis or weekly basis I personally use
software called
QuickBooks and I use software called
zero this is great because I run
multiple businesses online so some might
invoice some I receive via PayPal and
multiple different streams of income and
accounts but when you use the right
software you're able to manage all your
incoming and all your cut out coming and
if you don't have apps and I don't know
why you wouldn't have apps you can
simply look at your bank statements on a
regular basis I know lots of people
don't look at their statements and they
just leave them but it's worthwhile
seeing number one what payments you have
throwing out and what your balance is my
sister had been paying seven pounds
fifty every single month for the last
four years for a t-mobile phone that
there's no t-mobile anymore by the way
for a t-mobile phone that she hadn't
been using so she's literally just got a
refund of about 700 to 750 pounds and
for this thing that she's been paying
and she didn't realize but you'll never
know unless you kind of check your
statement and you might find that there
are little bits of money there
coming out that shouldn't be coming out
so keep your eyes peeled and definitely
monitor your accounts so tip number four
is to maximize your earnings and I'm not
saying start a business do this I'm
saying maximize your earnings for really
little means that everybody has access
to so something like setting up an ISO
account what you have is interest that
you can get at the end of the year
another thing is to switch between
accounts some accounts give you a
balanced payoff and by moving to them so
they might give you a hundred pounds for
joining their accounts and it's a great
way to get a competitive price from a
bank I believe that there are some
accounts where if you have direct debits
with them even if you pay two pounds a
month for that account every direct
debit makes you five pounds or what you
might make is an extra 20 to 25 pounds
per month so moving between counts and
getting any discount or coupons that are
available to you as a young person or
even as an adult you know even tax
refunds are great ways to maximize your
earnings so number five you need to
assess your spending and I've said this
a lot of times it's so important you
don't realize that a little spending and
it will chocolate here and a little
sandwich here and a little skirt here
all of this might be money that is
potentially going down the drain and
there may be ways that you could be
making a lot more money at the end of
the year but you fretted it away and I
did a little calculation of say when
summer sponge ten pounds a day and
really pays but ten pounds a day seven
days a week that's seventy pounds at the
end of the month you're spending 300
pounds at the end of the year that's
3,600 pounds that you have fretted away
on your belly okay now I work my food is
my vice you don't know that food is my
advice however if I thought about food
or 3,600 pounds 3600 pound sounds
amazing especially if I do it for four
years that's fourteen thousand four
hundred pounds that's a lot of money
that went on a cost of coffee and a
sandwich if we be realistic let alone
with the concept of compound interest
which I'm going to
about later one is in this video so it's
definitely worthwhile having a look at
how you're spending your money
especially on those little things that
you don't need to fritter away and
rather them frittering them or wasting
them why don't you you know put them in
a little piggy bag or put them in a
little kerim and say you know no I'm not
going to waste my money on these things
instead I'm going to wait at the end of
the year and I'm going to buy something
special
so my next concept when it comes to
finances is a divide and conquer and I
feel like budgeting is one of those
things that gets far too complicated
you've got to think about it too much
and I'm totally for the concept of
automating your finances and when I say
divide and conquer just think of all the
money you get in like a pie right so the
concept is basically to fit calculate
all the money that you make for a period
of time and then you take out what do
you need to live on and keep that in one
account that is your current count
that's what you need per month you can
divide that out by the week or however
you like to and then with whatever
balance you have and a quarter of that
should be spent in savings a quarter of
that should be spent in investments and
then you should leave a little bit of a
balance there to basically allow you to
have a little bit of fun with as well
and a key thing you can do is literally
set up different parent accounts you
might keep it with the same Bank but at
least you have put some money aside that
is going to better your future
so concept number seven and now we're
going to get a little bit complicated
but I'm keeping it like like this is
really light because I know some of my
audiences are really young but if you
really want to get into it then you can
do so the concept is compound
interesting if you don't know about
compound interesting it is a way to make
a postman a millionaire if you are
really really smart and it's the concept
of if you continue to save or leave a
balance for a significant amount of time
because you gain interest on an account
the interest you get on a balance
becomes increasingly more so if you
leave an amount for ten years
it might get two percent but two percent
on two percent on two percent and 2
percent on 2% on two percent for a
10-year basis can end up doubling
tripling or
contributing your money and there are
people who have been able basically
because they've left money for ten years
and money that they didn't really need
so they live their life but they put
this balance away that just got a small
amount of interest on it and what it is
it set them up with a trust fund for
life and if you have the opportunity to
get an account with a really good
interest rate on it and you're able to
leave that balance leave that balance
because when you look at it in like five
years or ten years and it's doubled or
tripled you are going to be like oh my
gosh and the longer you leave it the
more it increases so it kind of creases
on a multiplier effect which is
excellent it's what most financial
people will tell you to do and I'm not
saying save all your money but save an
amount that is affordable to you and let
that interest grow so my next point is
to invest your money and I don't I'm not
talking about stocks i'm not talking
about shares at this point in time
unless it's something you know about all
you want to get into I might talk about
it on another day but I mean investing
in yourself at this point in time so
there might be a way that if you invest
in educating yourself or learning a
skill that you can then make money off
in the future that might be paying for a
course that might be buying camera and
lighting equipment to make a living as a
photographer or as a youtuber so what
you want to do is potentially use your
money in a way that's going to make you
more money in the future and I know
sometimes some people find it quite hard
to spend a little money now because they
can't see where it's going to take them
but often I think it's really important
to put something down and now take a
risk let's take a bit on yourself today
for a brighter future tomorrow and also
if you have spent you know you know
everything you need to spend on you spin
it on everything you need to say you
saved a little bit of money there even
if it's 50 pounds a month that you
invest in yourself that's enough because
you never know if you spend that 50
pounds or that hundred pounds on
yourself today that might make you a
millionaire tomorrow so my next one is
it's more of a practical one and it's to
spend below your means do not be someone
who has did
keep up with the Joneses or just because
you've got some money spend it all
don't be ridiculous and I've had some
people who they come into money very
quickly and they spend it real quickly
and I think it's a great way to get
broke really quick just because you're
making a little bit now and then you
spend it all every single months you've
got nothing to show you you make four
thousand pounds a month right you've got
nothing to show for it no assets nothing
no no no if I make him four thousand
pounds a month if I'm making ten
thousand pounds a month but if I'm
making one thousand pounds a month I'm
spending three hundred pounds yeah
and leaving seven hundred to build into
my future if I'm making four thousand
pounds a month I'm spending five hundred
a month or spending three thousand five
hundred for my future so spend a ratio
of your money and but don't spend
everything it's not about keeping up
with the Joneses the more you spend
below your means the more you're able to
save invest and improve your future in
the long run and it might be hard today
when you have the kind of sacrifice or
get a flat that's not as fancy or you
might not be able to buy that designer
bag but instead you get the cheaper
version or you you know buy the samba
shoes instead of the Louboutins or
something
you might do that today but it means
that tomorrow you'll be in a better
position however it's still important to
treat yourself but set yourself aside a
treating of budget that maybe you spend
every three months versus every month
your hand-to-mouth because you spend
everything on a pair of shoes don't be
that person truly don't be that person
but there's nothing wrong with treating
yourself here and there so my final
point is a little bit of a boring point
but it's basically to be tax efficient
and this is more you know more applies
more to people who run their own
businesses or are freelancers and
potentially you know nothing about
paying taxes and can end up one paying
lots of fines or two spending lots on
accounting when you don't necessarily
need to or not being able to take
advantage of some of the opportunities
that are out there or legal or right
for people who are growing their
businesses the key thing I would do is
check um HMRC website really do your
research I would also say get in contact
with a set of really good accountants
who know your business in your area and
who are able to give you a plan on how
they could improve your finances and
ensure that you're not paying so much in
taxes because you are managing your
finances poorly where you can be tax
efficient do but I would always say seek
actual advice so guys that video was a
little bit a little bit serious but I
feel like it's really important to
really talk about how to get your money
in check it's so important and as I
mentioned definitely check out credit
Sesame comm no matter where you're from
in the world I'm sure it applies all
over these are the first steps to really
getting yourself into like financial
security and if in the long run you want
to be like you know financially stable
then these are the steps you can take
today to ensure that you have a good
feature so guys I hoped you enjoyed that
virgin journals and I feel like that's a
topic that I really wanted to talk about
and there's so much more but I don't
want to bombard you with like really
detailed stuff right about now but on my
blog I might get into it and show you my
complete and utter nerdy site because
I'm a top nerd if I be honest with you
but um yeah so guys thank you so much
