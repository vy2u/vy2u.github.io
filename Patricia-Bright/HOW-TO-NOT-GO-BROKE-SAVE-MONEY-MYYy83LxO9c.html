topic of money so I thought let me
address it in like one element which is
actually the element of saving money
we'll get on to making money maybe
another day but today for all my girls
who find that you know I the other limo
they are thirsty like that Zara had bags
coming out and I don't have any money to
buy it babies you don't want to be in
that position right for those of you who
are struggling and just can't work out
how to save your money so I know how
difficult it is to save money and you
know I'll be honest with you something I
still kind of struggle with may be
spending a lot is like my worst thing
but you know saving and spending come
hand in hand and if you don't have a lot
of money to keep spending then saving
can become a major major issue for you
so my first tip is actually to set a
goal there's no point in saving money if
you don't know what you're saving money
for why are you gonna have to be
motivated or excited to not buy that
chocolate bar right now and instead save
your money there has to be a reason for
me one of the major goals that I wanted
to achieve was one like was to open her
own house to buy a house so I it was
really really rigorous with my saving
when it came to wanting to buy a house
and also to pay for a wedding so
obviously that's of mine and my husband
that's money but we both needed to
contribute towards that so that was when
I made your goal so I found that it was
very easy for me to save my money
because I know that I got a wedding to
pay for
add that and the mortgage to pay and and
apartment to pay so I was like okay fine
this is my goal and every time I saved
money I knew that it was going to
achieve that goal it's great if that
goal could have like a financial number
around it so if you know that you want
to buy a car and your car costs ten
grand or five grand whatever then you
know that right that five grand is the
number and every single penny you put
into saving towards that reduces that
goal and makes that goal seem a lot more
attainable if you have no goal without
vision the people perish so you need a
goal when it comes to working out why
you even want to save your money the
next tip I have is to get real all of
your expenses and it is quite painful
whether you realize where your money
goes I realize that for myself that I
spend the money on food and yeah
food is my craft by the time you've gone
out on 350-pound dinners in a week
that's a hundred and fifty pounds you're
spending on filling your belly and that
food coming up the other end no no no no
so by the time I added that up at 600
pounds a month on eating let alone the
fact that I had to do grocery shopping
as well so when you sit down and take a
cold hard look where your money is going
you really are able to kind of rein it
in a workout is this thing a necessity
and for me I realize that realistically
going out for dinners on a regular basis
is not a necessity especially not three
times a week necessity it's kind of hard
sometimes to kind of reflect on yourself
but when you see like where all your
money is going you kind of get bit down
about it but at least if you get down it
makes you want to change it you can look
at your bank statements and even just
pile up your receipts over the past that
month or so and you're like I can't
believe I spend oh my gosh is that where
all my money went and when you calculate
that money up you'll be like oh my
goodness
so one of those great things you have to
do is really just get some perspective
see where you're spending your money so
once you've got your goal and you're
seeing where you're spending the money
the next thing is to start budgeting and
I know for some people the thought of
budgeting is like your notes so boring
who wants the budget why would you want
to do that but it's really really
essential and for those of you who want
a budgeting in a minute is very simple
work out all that you are getting in so
maybe from your parents it might be from
your part-time job might be from your
full-time job it might be from your
government I don't know
what how all the income that you receive
right and then work out all the income
that you have to pay so your bills your
phone bit of your tap your internet I
don't know what your bills are your
petrol and your gas money and all those
stuff your travel money that you have to
have to have to spend you work at that
number right so what you get in versus
what you get out there is going to be a
balance that's there right and that
balance is is what you basically should
be able to spend that balance is where
you dictate am I going to say this or
I'm not going to say this now I'm the
kind of person that I'm not going to try
and save the whole thing no I'm not
going to do that what I would do is
either split that in half or split it in
three quarters and save that and I give
myself a certain amount that no I'm
going to play and have fun with this
budget for the month this is what I'm
allowed to spend and then I can even
break it down by on a day-to-day basis
I'm allowed to spend ten quid or 20 or
100 or whatever or on a monthly basis
I'm allowed to spend this and when you
look at your money in like little bite
sized amount have it in your head well
I've already spent three pounds or I've
already spent four pounds on coffee
so later on today I can only spend you
know six pounds on food or something
like that it's a great way to kind of
make you think of your numbers in your
head rather than just thinking I'm just
going to close my eyes and spend it and
hopefully my card is not declined so
really try to buy budget and really try
to identify what you have available for
yourself to spend outside of your same
thing another tip that I enjoy doing and
I do this all the time is to spread my
money and when I say spend my money I
don't you waste it but I might give like
Mike some of my money and I say can you
just keep an eye on that might give my
sister some of my money and I like just
giving away my money or I have like
multiple different savings accounts so I
can basically not see where my money is
to live it's in one account with the one
card it's going to be used right but if
I've got it in all these different
locations it means that I never ever
one-shot and obviously I live with
people who I really trust and are
accountable and I can basically in my
coming at some extra money and you'll be
like yeah sure this is the money that
you save from here and there so that's a
great thing to do
break your money up so that you're not
you know that you always have something
extra for a rainy day finally when it
comes to saving money
sacchi it a reason about spending money
right in reality why do we spend so much
money or why might you spend so much
money you might have the archers off
that and one of the things I realized
that nowadays is that we won't spend a
lot of money because we're watching
everybody else and let me tell you guys
you should not watch anybody you should
not be trying to keep up with the
Joneses they might buy a new bag they
might buy a new shoe might buy a new
house they but you don't know what other
people's circumstances are you don't
know if that money is stolen you don't
know if that money is credit card you
don't want to know if that money is
their mama's money you have no idea so
sometimes the one thing that comes to
saving when you're thinking about
finances in about staying in your own
lane and creating your own goal and your
own reason for doing whatever you're
doing don't do say because you want to
compete or compare yourselves to anybody
else because it's going to either leave
you in debt or leave you feeling very
very disappointed and I think what's
important is to have that goal in mind
and especially if that goal is a
positive goal like I want to one day be
able to make sure my mom never has to
work again you know those are the kind
of goals that are really going to impact
your life in a positive way so don't
watch others on what they're doing let
them go and let them get into Delta let
them do whatever they do and just do
your own thing stay in your lane and
focus on your own goal and hopefully
that is going to help you to be
successful when it comes to saving your
money now I know for some of you guys
it's hard to like it's hard to even have
money in the first place which I
is a little bit of a struggle for lots
of people so I want to do a video on
that at some point in time but if you
guys enjoyed this video that give me a
thumbs up and I will hope to do more of
these chatty videos soon and I will see
you guys later
