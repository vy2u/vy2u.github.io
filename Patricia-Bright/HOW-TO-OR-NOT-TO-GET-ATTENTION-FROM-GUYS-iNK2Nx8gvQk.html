waiver for you
yay like I always say get a cup of tea
get comfortable and we will get started
today I thought I would talk about the
topic of how not to be approached by men
but it could easily be reversed and how
to be approached by men for my single
ladies and this happened after a little
salsa happened this summer and I've been
out of the game for a while and I was
kind of lost right I didn't know I was
going and I looked lost right and this
guy he was topless with this but you
know it was summer and it was warm and
he came over I was at watching it and he
seemed really really nice like really
friendly and sup and I did think why is
this guy not wearing the top but I
thought do you know what yet whatever
and then he is I always trying to go and
I basically was like oh yeah I'm looking
for this fancy dresser he's like yeah I
know where that is I'll take you right
there and I said yeah okay then so you
know we were walking down a lady that I
like I let this guy walk me all the way
to this place right and I don't know why
I did that but you know I said as I said
I've been out of the game for so long
that I was kind of like all innocent
smiling dandy found out where he was
from found out he was a personal trainer
which explained the toplessness and you
know at the end of the journey I got to
my destination and wanted to go Chiru
terror and he's like secondly a number
and I said well wasn't quite sure what
to do at the end of it and obviously the
artist like I'm a married woman and he
went along his merry way but I thought
to myself how do I not get myself into
this these kind of situations in the
future and actually what was the trick
that did it and that I can pass on to
the gods who want that kind of attention
you know
so number one is the eye contact when
you see a guy or when you see a guy and
he sees you and your eyes lock that's
almost that like invitation like that
eyes like Oh talk to me those eyes are a
massive invitation to a guy to come over
so you know you really want to avoid eye
contact and they'll now hand make lots
of eye contact if you want to be
approached by a guy and sometimes
accidentally your eyes do meet across
the room or across the road or whatever
and basically what you need to do is
just do the quick look away which is
kind of like a which can look a little
bit mean but you rather hurt their
feelings before they even come and make
that approach there if you don't want to
do that then you know peep knows perhaps
word like come to me without looking
scary next is about the smile I think
that guys absolutely love a girl who
smiles especially over some girls think
is all about looking station you know
but I actually think like a girl who
looks really happy and opening guys are
going to approach quite intensely
because it makes the thing isn't she
sweet isn't she innocent maybe I've got
up you know a chance here with this
lovely little girl and that bearing of
your teeth often fills them with burning
desire in their loins therefore I would
avoid smiling at a guy if you have
basically made eye contact but
definitely avoid that smell and if you
don't to be approached get your bitch
face on looking a lost this was a key
thing that I did like looking loss will
make any man think I'll come and save
her come in I want to swoop to your
rescue I realize that that looking loss
was my downfall because it gave the
opportunity for someone he felt that
they were that you know the expert come
and save me and often if you're out and
about and you look confused or you look
like this kind of look a guy might
approach you and say can I help you
miss cannot save you can I sweep myself
with my topless juiciness yeah that
might happen so what you want to do is
even if you are lost right get your
phone either directly ask I'm looking
for this place do you know where it is
in quite the stern voice or you know get
your Google Maps out and look like you
know what you're doing right now
with a very stern face like yes and make
it out light you know someone's about to
come and get you if you don't want a guy
to be like can I help you miss if you do
end up somehow in conversation which
does happen what you want to do is keep
your answers short sweet and sharp you
don't want to be rude obviously rudeness
is never never goes down nicely and
leaves a very sour taste but what you
want to do is to say yeah no okay thanks
and I think after that he'll get the
picture especially if you don't ask him
any questions about himself and realized
okay she's not really very interesting
and girls who do want to attract a guy
then basically Arc's leading questions
so what do you think about that what's
your thoughts on that where did you get
that from oh that's amazing and a couple
of compliments there lean in with the
shoulder and that will hopefully mean
that he gets it you're interested he'll
keep the ball rolling if you want to do
next if all else fails and he doesn't
get the message you have to do that I
have a boyfriend - I have a husband line
and it's I really hate that line I find
it really really cliche because you can
either either sponsor I wasn't
interested anyway or if you get risk the
response of so or you can get the
response of bitch you okay which is not
a response that anyone wants but if you
got to do it you've got to do it in the
most respectful manner
and if all else fails that Jen marble
says basically do with the space do
anything strange dribble pick your nose
flail your arms in the air and he might
get the picture think this girl isn't
for me unless he's into that kind of
thing and then I have no other kind of
tips for you so guys I hope you enjoyed
