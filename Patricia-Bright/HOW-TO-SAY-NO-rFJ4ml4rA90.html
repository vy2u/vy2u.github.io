you are enjoying the Christmas and
festive period I'm very excited to do
this video because it's a long time
coming in though I just wanted to say I
know I've had a lot of comments like
Patricia you've changed and all this
kind of stuff like you're not the same
person you were something and I find
that such a weird thing to say because
two videos ago and the same person they
like take a video later
I'm completely change and like people
like you don't do the talking videos and
like my last video was like dealing with
never feeling good enough and obviously
when I do videos like this they like
really coming from a genuine place like
how I actually genuinely feel and
sometimes I feel great so I gonna talk
on nothing right about now
so um bear with me and like honestly I'm
the same person I'm just a little bit
older okay we all grow up a little bit
and yeah but hopefully I'm still amazed
open and sad anyway today I wanted to
talk about the topic of learning to say
no and I don't know why it's a very hard
thing for a lot of us to do and I found
it a very very hard thing to do and I
realize that I kept saying yes like I
say oh yeah sure and it's a totally
British thing to do and I'm sure loads
of other people do it but when you're so
polite that you just constantly say yes
even though your minds like no no don't
say yeah okay yeah yeah with that pained
expression then you're like why have I
just said yes to that and it used to
happen to me all the time when I was
like Patricia you've actually got to
stop doing this so I thought to myself
I'm definitely not the only one who says
yes to things that I don't want to do
and I was like why is it so hard to just
say no like but why does yes just
automatically come out of the mouth and
I was like you know what I've really got
to change this because it really is it
good for me and I realized that it said
yes to all this stuff and I was getting
really quite you know what tough about
it and like really worried about
disappointing people
failing people
or doing something wrong so literally
working myself off the cosh to like you
know please everyone and I realize that
you just can't do that in life right
thank God we don't all have to say yes
to everything
so today I wanted to teach you guys and
myself how to actually say no kind of
without saying no right so the first
thing you've really got to do is to
realize why is it that you actually
always say yes and it might be something
in bill it might be the way that you are
raised it might be your fear of
disappointment as so many different ways
of why you may be someone who's not very
assertive at saying no you really need
to kind of pinpoint that so you can kind
of really make a change for me it's that
I have this belief of I can do it like I
can always make everything work so I say
yes and then I'll just kind of scramble
and work it out in the end once you've
done that you can then realize that
saying no is not the worst thing in the
world and I also realize that our song
is that is that if I don't do that then
this this and this and this is gonna
happen if I don't say yes then they
might hate me if I don't say yes then he
might not like me all these kind of
things are in your head and your brain
is telling you all these reasons why
you've got to do that thing that you
don't actually want to do you're gonna
be like mad and trying not to think
about the worst-case scenario and
instead think of how much better your
life is gonna be when you actually say
no you can't come over and stay tonight
actually next you probably want some
nicer ways to let people down or to say
no or change your plans in a really
gentle way now I think the first thing
that you've got to learn to do is to be
kind of assertive and you have to kind
of say no without being apologetic and
and I mean acts like I'm really sorry
I'm really kind and coming up with all
these excuses you've got to be like
really honest about it and because by
the time you try and lie about your know
like oh no you can't come over I or you
can't stay over and having I've got an
ant infestation like people making up
excuses you know if you don't want them
to come over just say you know what no
don't come over now's not a good time
for me but I'll get back to you
when it is learning to basically not
just say like a flat no or a flat yes
you can then give a reason that is not
related to an external thing but
yourself you don't even have to give an
explanation half the time and if they
say why it's a personal matter it's very
very simple after that if you can't say
known that way one of the key things
that I've learnt to do and it also gives
me great thinking space is actually to
say I'll get back to you on that and I
realize that when I say that it's not
saying no but it's actually giving me
time to formulate an answer because
sometimes I've let yeah yeah yeah yes
sure sure
and I've said yes before I've even
thought about what I'm actually doing so
it's better to say I'll get back to you
on that I'll let me ever think about
that can I send you an email back that
we rather than saying yes straightaway
is a great way to give yourself thinking
time and let people down gently without
kindly letting them down but I think
finally you've got to realise you are
entitled to say no like it's your life
and sometimes some people will
continually impose things on you because
they know or sure do it because you've
become known as a goal who'll just do it
you know I have such respect for people
I like no I'm not doing that right now
and not that there rune is literally
like they're really assertive and I was
like man I need to be like that I helped
you I'd be like that and I'm sure you
look at people like that and you have to
be more confident in yourself that you
are it's your life it's your time it's
your money it's your house it's your car
it's your picture I don't know it's
whatever is is yours because they're
clearly asking for it and it is for you
to give it if you so desire so guys that
was just a quick chit chat video but it
really felt like doing it because it's
one of those things that was pressing on
my heart but in the new year I'm going
to have a talk of topical talk about it
something Tuesday like every every week
every every week every week so any other
topics you guys want me to have a chat
about with you then let me know
and if you are someone who is either
really assertive please do leave a
comment below so that others can learn
from you and if you're someone who's you
know had this difficulty as well like
maybe explain your situation as well
because I find that in the comments when
you guys get talking together
it's a beautiful it's a beautiful space
on the Patricia brat channel that I love
so yeah that's basically it and I hope
you're having a great Christmas time I'm
going to do this look is why it's going
to be my next video so keep watching and
thumbs up if you want to see more and
yeah I love you all and I'll see you
guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
