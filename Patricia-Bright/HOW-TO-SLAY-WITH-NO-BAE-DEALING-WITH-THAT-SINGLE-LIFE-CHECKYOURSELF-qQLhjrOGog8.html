today's a video it's about to be the
first official video associates LCME
well we are going to get serious about
making our lives better as women and as
God and today we are going to be
touching on the topic of relationships
already the lack of relationships I've
got enough single friends to know that
the struggle of no Bey is actually real
however some of us still want to know
how to slay even if we don't have a B
and if you don't already know I'm having
a major giveaway this month I'll be
giving away not one but two MacBook Pros
as well as two iPhones and at the end of
every video I've got some major beauty
gifts all you have to do is be
subscribed it's free and to follow me on
my Instagram my Twitter and my bro
channel which I'll have all linked down
below right let's get straight into this
video so I totally get it
struggle of not having a partner for
some females is a hundred percent real I
personally I'm not currently single but
I have a lot of single friends close to
me and close by me and I have single
friends who are doing it amazingly and
then I have single friends who sometimes
I look at them and I'm like so from
assessing the single market out there
from the girls and guys that I've been
minor there are a couple of things that
I have noticed that are very important
for you as a single girl to do and I
think that's anyone who wants to be an
independent and fully rounded person so
my first tip is to get busy you know and
I idle hands you know what they say if
you are just twiddling your thumbs
waiting for Prince Charming to walk in
and save you then potentially you're
going to be waiting a very long time if
you have a really good job that you can
focus on hobbies great friendship groups
something that is going to keep you
occupied but also bring something
interesting and creative to a table that
you know might be an opportunity in the
future it's gonna be a great thing there
is nothing like people who are just
jobless as I like to call them just
sitting around
just with no plans it is not attractive
and it is not great for your own
well-being to just be sitting down
waiting for something get busy and get
creative and a lot of people that I know
who are single and are in relationships
often meet their partners at you know
things that they did together or you
know groups that they were part of and
then they got interested in each other
so whether it is wood work you do or
bachata or Bible study or something like
that try and get do things outside of
your work gonna try and be creative and
make sure you are socializing because
you know if you're out in a bad way it
is to treat yourself because you are
worth it the girl you are hundred a
million percent worth it and not because
a guy is going to do it for you you're
worth it because you decide you are
worth it and it's really important to
learn to be quite self-reliant because
you don't know how long it's gonna be
till somebody comes into your life and
you don't know what the status of that
individual is going to be so what you
want to do is learn to look after
yourself and be independent and know
that you are worth it because you decide
it and not because somebody else decides
that they're gonna get you something and
also self worth is not necessarily
determined by the things that you have
there's nothing wrong with a treat now
and then especially if you give it to
yourself so if you want to slay without
a BAE you must make sure you've got your
own goals your short term medium term
and long term goals I know I have so
many friends who like their way in on a
guy before on their bad guy or being
married before they do this this and
that and they're kind of in this a limbo
place because they're waiting for
someone to come in and sweep them off
their feet and change their life no no
no no ladies you've got to change your
life yourself
it all starts from today if you want to
lay the foundation for your future so
write your own goals you know set your
own set your own pace and obviously if
someone comes in they're gonna have
goals and you guys can work on your
goals together and create one whole goal
but and even as a married woman it for
me my partner
having hidden goals and me having my own
goal and I supporting each other makes
us stronger if you come in if you come
to the party in a relationship you kind
of got you've got no no direction you
kind of looking at your partner with
puppy-dog eyes now you are the weak link
now you are the news and the weight on
someone's neck so if you are single and
you are you don't have someone in your
life yet now is the time you get to be
independent and build your own future
your own goals that your partner can be
part of on the journey so another way to
say without a vase unfortunately is to
avoid a bitter and this can be any sense
let go or guy it's just that bitter
group of people who are moaning about
their relationship status or lack of
relationship status or the f boys or the
F girls they're dealing with it's just a
really negative environment that you end
up being sucked into and from my expert
I mean it's not like we all have a
little bit of gossip we all love a
little bit of drama but if you're
surrounding yourself with girls or guys
who are seeing like five ten different
girls or guys at a time I've got lots of
drama
lots of treat in lots of I'm commitment
and you around that and they're moaning
and then mmmm now all of that is
something me rubbing onto you like no
like honestly like words and what you
surround yourself
I literally a burden on your head and if
you seriously want to slay and want to
prepare yourself for hopefully maybe one
day being in a really good relationship
the normal that is toxic to your mind
and to your spirit you just need to be
like ah not for me and as it's just
mentioned spirit I say it's really
important to work on developing yourself
spiritually mentally and emotionally if
you are strong within yourself and
confident within yourself you are very
likely to slay whenever you go and there
is nothing like a woman who eludes
confidence
Tachi attract what they want in their
lives the girl work on yourself be
confident in your singleness and in that
way you will be able to attract someone
who's also confident in their life and
you guys can build together if that is
what you want so guys those are some of
my
