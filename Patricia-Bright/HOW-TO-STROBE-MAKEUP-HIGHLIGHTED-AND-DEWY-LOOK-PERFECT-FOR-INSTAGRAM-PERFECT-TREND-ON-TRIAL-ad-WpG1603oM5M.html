looking bear face because i'm going to
do a makeup tutorial and i want to kind
of do a thing called kind of trend on
trial where i'll do some of the makeup
trends that I really really like settle
down doing strobing makeup for those of
you who don't know what it is it's all
about having them glow where you're
basically highlighted to the guards and
you just have just an iridescent go and
I absolutely love that and I think it's
a little bit hard to do if you're an
oily person because there's a fine
balance between looking oily and looking
glowy so hopefully I'm able to achieve
that so today I'm working in
collaboration with House of Fraser you
have their beauty confidential events
that are going to be happening in store
from the 7th to the 22nd of September
and they're going to be having 10 pounds
of 30 favorites when you buy a House of
Fraser favorites but they've got
products that is the Giorgio Armani
luminous silk which I love the Naz
audacious lipstick there's going to be
so much activity happening in store and
online so make sure you check out the
link in my description but man to think
that everything I'm showing in this
video will also have 10 pounds of
install so make sure you guys check that
out and if you want to talk up on your
beauty this is definitely going to be
the time to do it so in the meantime I'm
going to get started and I'm going to
show you how I do that strobing look and
I'm gonna make it a chatty video cuz I
really like chatty videos number one I'm
using the light masters primer from
Giorgio Armani and this is just a really
nice primer just to start off with your
foundation this primer has kind of got
some kind of iridescent glow to it you
know just underneath and I don't know if
you guys can see it on camera but it's
kind of got this kind of fluorescent
nough stew it which I know could be a
bit scary if you're like hold on where I
am does my face look iridescent like
this but when you put your foundation on
it's going to look absolutely flawless
I'm going to go ahead and use the
Clinique beyond perfecting foundation
and concealer foundation this is a new
foundation I've started to use and it's
quickly become a favorite of mine I feel
like I've been wearing it all the time
and I love the applicator so when it
comes to like just rubbing on my
foundation I like to use a kabuki brush
nowadays but I use my hands and I use
all kinds of different things so this
foundation is more like a concealer and
foundation at the same time and it just
gives me absolutely amazing coverage
without looking heavy I just love the
way this foundation looks for me and now
go ahead and apply my concealer and it
is the Estee Lauder Double Wear I feel
like this is my favorite concealer it's
just never gonna change basically and I
just put that underneath my eyes and
along the bridge of my nose and I do
feel like the concealing part is quite
important as well to really aid that
highlighting where you come to do it I'm
kind of doing reverse contouring by
using a concealer color underneath my my
cheek bone air and that helps it to pop
a little bit because we're strobing you
kind of don't contour then I'm going to
go ahead and just add my powder my kind
normally would just underneath to say
everything right so my brows are done
I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to
do my eyes I'm using the urban decay
smoky palette and for me I just like to
use girls that I feel like you're going
to do something that is stripy go gold
or go home I'm using dirty sweetly on my
lid and I found that if I just put a
color on the center of my eye it looks
better than when I put it on all over
then I'm going to use radar which is
slightly darker just on the outskirts
then I'm going to use whiskey which is a
matte brown just to kind of bridge
everything off and blend it all in
together for me I always like a winged
eyeliner to finish my eye locks so I'm
going to go ahead and use the Khaliq
chubby lash fattening mascara just to
put this on my lashes before I put on my
falsies you guys know I am a falsie girl
for life so now I'm going to start the
strobing part and strobing is not a
complicated thing for me it's basically
just using really good highlighter and
it's not using any contour or very
little contour and then using your
favorite bronzers and stuff just to add
more dimension and color and stuff to
yourself so I'm using this brightening
brick which is from Bobbi Brown and love
Bobbi Brown and I'm using a Bobby Brown
sheer powder brush but I like to kind of
grip it so that I can select from these
two areas because I feel like these ones
are the warmer gold and bronzes and I'm
just going to just go wild and just put
that over here I kind of do it in a
c-shape now a funny thing is I do have a
lot on but you really can't tell that
much on camera but what it is giving me
it's just a really nice kind of
iridescent glow and I like quite light
bronze in just down the middle of my
face and then like a t-shape as well I'm
going to go ahead with the brushy color
that's on this as well and just add a
little bit blushed to myself
and I'm using this terracotta bronzing
powder from Guerlain and it smells
delicious now I'm not a big branding
powder user but I really do feel like it
makes such a difference especially if
you want to do something that looks
really glowy and dewy without looking
oily so guys that is my strobing
tutorial I hope you guys like that and
it's got a kind of glowy iridescent look
that you felt very easy to do I think
sometimes eye makeup trends like big
names II like what is that it's all
about getting that perfect glow and I
hope you guys can see and it's easy for
you to do let me know if you recreate it
as I mentioned I'm working in
partnership with House of Fraser they've
got their amazing Beauty confidential
events that going to be happening in
stores all over lots of the products
that I've used in this video will have
ten pounds off when you buy a House of
Fraser favorite so make sure you check
out my description bar below and get
yourself into store and get yourself
some goodies in the meantime I will
catch you later and watching guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
