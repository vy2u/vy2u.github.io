me and thinking Patricia yes your swag
is looking amazing or you're probably
looking rethinking Patricia what are you
wearing right now and it is glasses
today I'm basically going to do a
glasses and style video and I know so
many people let me know if you're one of
those people who should be wearing your
glasses but aren't because you don't
necessarily feel like they work with
your personal style or don't feel that
you look that good in them I feel that
glasses can look really amazing if you
know what glass is to pick so that's
what I wanted to share with you guys
today
they're from glasses usa.com and they've
got such a variety of super affordable
and prescription glasses some glasses
loads of different glasses and like
they'd have a really good return policy
there's so many different styles I feel
that nowadays I know that people used to
buy glasses like once a year or once
every two years but now I feel that you
can change your glasses with your
wardrobe as well so the first pair are
these pair and these are kind of like an
aviator with a metal frame and these are
my favorite favorite player I showed
them on my snapchat and people like oh
my gosh where are those glasses from all
my glasses are from glasses usa.com
make sure you check it out and I have a
discount code in the description box
they're kind of like that 70s vibes
they're super cool but there's not got
like a dark frame that kind of can
overtake your face
obviously the style is the typical kind
of area to kind of drop down which is
great for someone with a long face but
I've got more of a heart-shaped face it
doesn't overwhelm or shorten my face
which i think looks really nice after
that my favorite frames
are these and I love a kind of cat eye
style frame these are very feminine and
very fashionable and anytime you find a
frame that kind of does this it's going
to elongate your face and it's always
going to make you look like you fashion
you are fashion but I do also feel like
these are quite a standout pair they
kind of make me think Anna Wintour they
make me think vogue editors you know
they're kind of like an older lady who's
got lots of swag who
is comfortable you have to be really
comfortable with yourself to rock
something like this but if you can get
like bold lips like a crisp white shell
or a black polo it looks really good
it's very very fashionable it's kind of
Parisian and I'm loving it as well these
here are kind of like Giggy cheek
glasses to me so it's got the thick top
frame and a thin art frame around the
bottom again is if you kind of want to
stand out look but you don't want to do
too much like the kind of cat eye style
glasses me and my husband basically have
these as our matching pair of glasses
and I think they're super super cute and
there's so many different frames that
are like this you can get the Ray Ban
ones obviously these are an own brand
one but they look amazing and they're
super affordable and you can also get
the top in lots of different frame
colors as well but I think these are
super like classic and they look really
nice glasses like this are great as well
if your eyebrows are not on fleek these
kind of almost create the illusion of
having eyebrows especially tilt your
head a little bit next up is a bit more
of a round frame as well and I don't
necessarily think that round frames are
perfect for my face shape but I think
these look good because they're slightly
flatter on the top and they are a dark
black frame which I think usually stand
out but these frames are not too big and
these are giving me all kinds of sexy
teacher kind of vibe if you might be
someone who works in like a really
corporate environment or somewhere where
you know you don't want to be walking in
with your big Anna Wintour glasses or if
you can't wear like clear aviators then
I think these are really nice classic
pair to go for so these are those I want
to be a bit more chill a little bit more
calm kind of days so most of the glass
I've just shown you are either clear or
black I do find that black glasses are
quite a bit stand out so Browns and
tortoids shell are a really good option
and I love this pair here I really like
them they're flat on the top but they've
got the volume down here great for
making your nose look a little bit
smaller
I definitely think these glasses are
super artistic key glasses I can totally
imagine wearing these with like an
oversized t-shirt some mum jeans and
some trainers and just going about my
everyday life these are the me girls
these are definitely than me I'm getting
all relaxed in these so finally I've got
these rectangle shaped glasses and these
are a typical you know classic pair of
glasses if you want to keep it simple
but with a little edge as you can see
there's a little bit of blue on the
inside frame there if you have to be
quite corporate or keep your style quite
d'amore then these are a great pair to
go for I do find that rectangle glasses
are much better for a long narrow face
and a face that is short like mine
because it's really just gonna you know
compress your face and my head is
already small I used to be called peanut
head and again you do need the classics
in your collection as well so guys that
is the end of this video I'm hoping that
it gave you guys some inspiration
especially you glasses whereas out there
who should be wearing your glasses but
also if you're someone who feels like
glasses are really expensive I should
only buy them once a year no switch them
up with your style and reveal Kozik and
websites like gasps is usa.com
absolutely amazing because you get fast
delivery they chip all over the world
the prices are affordable you get
excellent frames that aren't designer
but also designers as well and if you
don't like them you can send them back
so you can chests and play with style
nowadays as long as you know your
prescription why not buy some glasses
why not have a play around and see what
you can find and see what suits you so
guys thank you so much for watching and
I will catch you guys in my next video
bye
