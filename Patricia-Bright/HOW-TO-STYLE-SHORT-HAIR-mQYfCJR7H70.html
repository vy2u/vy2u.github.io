think you guys probably think that I
look a little bit different I have gone
for shorter hair and I thought I would
do an updated hair routine video
actually I don't think I've ever done a
hair routine video but you guys often
arts for hair tutorials and I'm really
sorry but I just never do them because I
never feel like I'm I'm not very
inventive or creative with my hair I
wear what works for me I've been wearing
the same hair extensions were probably
for five years but I've gotten four
shorter hair and I realized that I
always go for shorter hair about this
time of year I look back on my old
videos and it's always in my typer
December or November I don't get a
haircut I am wearing we here and the
hair texture I wear is called like yaki
so it's got a little bit of texture in
it so it's not like really really silky
it's a little bit coarser and so it
matches my relaxed hair or my natural
hair and is growing now you know how
mmhmm yeah I think that's it so I hope
you enjoy the cheeto and it shows you
how I basically get my wet you know get
my hair to this and if you guys want to
see in everyday makeup of teen then just
give me a thumbs up on this video and
I'll try to make that right a video that
comes up real easy okay guys there I'll
catch you later bye so guys let's go as
you can see my hair is relatively where
I basically washed my weave about once
and
so these things right here are my trusty
tools for blow-drying my hair so firstly
I start off with separating my hair just
to make it all a little bit easier and I
brush out the bits I'm going to start
with the guys I've got to let you know
that I absolutely love a round brush
blow dry it just gives you the most
amount of body which when you've got
short hair and kind of really want to
have so one of the first tip for round
brush blow drying is basically ensuring
you have a really good bristle brush and
a round brush that you can get from
Superdrug will probably have this next
you want to basically keep the brush as
taut as you can and basically keep
spinning and twirling and spinning and
twirling
and what you'll see is you'll get a nice
silky finish with somebody and
especially if you have a really good
blow dryer surprisingly enough I
actually got this blow dryer on the
women in Tesco and it's absolutely
amazing with this controlled nozzle and
equipped it if you direct the heat of
the blow dryer underneath your hair
you're going to get lots more body and
movement so by the time I've got here
I'm relatively tired this takes me about
half an hour and you can see I'm just
grabbing as much as I can and twirling
twirling where I can so guys I am
virtually done as you can see the hairs
got lots of body and movement
so to add a little bit of refinement you
can probably run hair straighteners
through it though guys that's me done so
what do you guys think should I stick
with the short hair let me know and give
me a little thumbs up if you want to see
a few more hair tutorials so guys thank
you so much for watching and I'll see
you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
