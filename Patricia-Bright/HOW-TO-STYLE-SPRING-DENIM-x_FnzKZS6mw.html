you how I stole some of my spring denim
as I wear jeans basically all the time
so the first pair I wanted to show you
what a high waisted pair I love high
waisted jeans I think they're really
flattering I usually just wear them with
like a cropped jumper and like wear a
jacket or something over it these are
honestly really flattering for all body
shapes skinny curvy doesn't really
matter and the great thing about it is
that if you have kind of lumps about me
you just kind of cover them all up so my
next pair are basically boyfriend jeans
that kind of torn and sometimes I can't
quite decide on how I want to wear these
if I the heels or flats but I always
like to pair it with like a new shirt or
a denim jacket and have a little dance
as well and they're super comfortable
and they look really nice with like a
pair of converses or something
so another pair of jeans I love wearing
our colored jeans and I've got this
green pen I've had for ages and bringing
it back out this spring you know I think
they look really smart as well and you
can kind of color coordinate if you
decide to but don't think denim just has
to be blue so a huge spring trend for
denim basically ripped and cut at the
knees it's a back in fashion but if I
have an old pair I can do this I
basically just draw a line get a pair of
scissors and just kind of fray frays the
lines a little bit more and there you
have super easy all pairs of jeans that
are now spring ready
finally it's like my jegging type of
denim and jeans I can't get enough of
these they're super skinny but the great
thing about them is how comfortable they
are
they literally feel like pajamas but in
denim I absolutely love them guys that
is how I'm styling my denim for spring I
hope it gave you a couple of ideas make
sure you click for more videos thumbs up
and subscribe if you're not already I'll
see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
