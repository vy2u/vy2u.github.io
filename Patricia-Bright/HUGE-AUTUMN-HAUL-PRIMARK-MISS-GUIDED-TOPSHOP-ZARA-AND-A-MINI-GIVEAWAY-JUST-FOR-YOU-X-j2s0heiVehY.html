of these for ages but this is a juicy
juicy juicy hole people I'm very excited
to share with you some of the goodies
that I've bought over the last couple of
months yeah I had kind of been a bit
spendy spendy people but I loved it and
as I always say get a cup of tea and get
comfortable cuz it's gonna be a long one
so first things first I'm gonna start
off with the stuff that I got from ASOS
these ears are number one as you can see
you might be wondering why I'm wearing
them I'm wondering why I'm wearing them
but they're super cute I did a beauty
panel with a zooss and these were there
and that from that day I knew I was
gonna get them I'm gonna link the videos
below guys if you want to check those
out the videos that I did for a zooss
which is typical Fleur was in it and a
couple of other people as well so you
can check those out below next I bought
this jumper it is a wrap a wrap front
jumper I've been desperately looking for
wrap front jumpers because they're been
sexy you know this is a really nice gray
and it's like a really nice material it
was quite expensive I think for a jumper
but it's worth it it's really nice and
oversized and I can't wait to wear it
for like the autumn seasons
next up is this jumper here which is
from it's also from a source but it's
actually a new-look jumper another thing
I'm obsessed with
are turtlenecks or polo necks and this
is such a gorgeous gorgeous one and it
was a really good price so that is that
and then this jumper here look at this
jumper Mike hates this jumper he's like
this is a grand dad jumper but I'm like
your granddad musclehead style cuz this
is so stylish
and I know what you guys think for me I
literally love the pattern that's on
this I think it's such a gorgeous like
kind you know it's granddaddy it is
actually very granddaddy but I like that
I think it's on trend so next I hit up
Primark in Oxford Street I rarely go to
Primark because there's no no prime UPS
in it to me but you know what were you
going there it's a little bit like
ridiculous it's so ridiculous at the
stuff you can get and yeah I went a bit
crazy so first thing I bought another
grand
in style jumper but how cute is this but
genuinely there was even a matching
skirt but I couldn't find it like it was
sold out how cute is this jumper people
come on come on come on I'm absolutely
in love I'm just thinking of winter by
the fire hot chocolate and this another
one is a cable knit jumper I love a
cable knit jumper and the funny thing is
I couldn't find any in my size but then
they have a size 18 and I was like you
know what this looks really nice like
when it's oversized like I thought so
much queue to have like leggings or
something to get a really nice oversized
cable knit jumper like this one oh and
then bought another polo neck in a
purple I'm not so sure about this kind
of no that's a bit sickly in the
daylight well you don't have the lights
of the closet called of the shop like
caring making everything look better
than it does but this is another pony
look this is like five quid it so we'll
see how that goes then I bought these
I'm I'm in love with like box t-shirts
I've hid they're really flattering
you know crop tops are a little bit
overdone at the moment so I'm hoping we
can all go really boxy so I can hide my
stomach so this is so so cute it's it
looks like much more expensive than it
was it was 12 pounds but this is really
good quality this is a really nice piece
it's in a nice black and white color
like this and then they had another one
which was quite garish like dude then I
like Christmas tree but I liked it I
thought this is really cute this is
gorgeous
sky trust me this is a knockoff from the
Zara skirt but it is they're lovely and
what do they call this shape of skirt I
have no idea what they call this shape
of skirt but I love it I love it in the
cream as well they did have a matching
top but they had none in my size or a
size that I could make work for me this
was a dream so obviously there are these
trends that always happen right like
this pink coat or blue coat or like fur
whatever and I don't like spending a lot
of money on things that are trend
because the reality is that that trend
is gonna be out and by the time you
spent 300 pounds on a jacket
so that like pink furry jackets are
definitely in and Primark had 125 quid
and I was like you know what
Patricia why not like hello pink very
jacket there's this blogger that I love
her name's Natasha and love vu she had a
look where she had like this pink jacket
on she's just beautiful she looks so hot
and that just inspired me right yes pink
jacket for me the final piece I got
which is a classic is a chiffon shirt if
anybody knows me I love a shirt like
this like all day every single day okay
so guys the Sun has just come out over
there so it might look a bit crazy you
can see the black shirt how cute it is
so next up our Top Shop items this crop
jumper here is from Topshop they do like
these really basic pieces that you can
get like 1 or 10 of and this is just one
of their little crop jumpers it's so
soft and so cozy and I've not been
wearing much color but I saw the rare
doesn't know what I'm wearing red and it
looks really really nice I also bought
these trousers which are dry they look
gorgeous with a polos neck jumper I did
a blog post wearing it I'll link my blog
down below
Patricia bright coat UK these are
gorgeous they're sick of wet trousers
and they just give me a really nice
shape but in the same breath it's not
like everything on show the next I
bought a few jewelry pieces from Urban
Outfitters I love their jewelry I think
most of my favorite bits of jewelry I've
ever had they are actually all from
Urban Outfitters
so it's this necklace here which has got
a little clear pendant and a little like
kind of looks like a coin and then I
bought these little bangles they're like
three quid three pounds and then this
necklace here as well but I'll put them
up closer you can get better look at
those so you guys know misguided it
wasn't like you leave my favour and I
for some reason I had it been on the
misguided side for ages went back there
bought the whole shop literally she had
to return some stuff because I got so
carried away I bought like I drew like
no picture sure no I had to stop myself
you guys have done that before we've all
done that before but I had to curtail
myself but I bought this polo neck
crop jumper I was wearing in my I'm
never feeling good enough video lots of
people were asking about it it is this
jumper here I'll link that video below
if you haven't caught it yet as well
it's so gorgeous and so cozy very very
cooked I need to work with high-waisted
trousers and then I bought this gorgeous
little sure you know misguided loves a
crop piece they're all their items are
cropped but yeah this shirt here and
what I loved about it is that although
it's cropped it has this really nice
lace pattern on the bottom of the shirt
and I just thought it was a really nice
elegant piece especially with like
Connor I then bought another just a
chunky knit jumper which you know
looking at this I'm like oh no this is a
misguided this is for mom this is from
Azores hello this is a really nice gray
jumper with like a round bottom half and
it's like oversized thank you there's
also go a loss yay
continuing on with misguided this is
such a gorgeous gorgeous piece I have a
blog post that it should be live now
with this item on I will link it below
but it's so so gorgeous it's made of
like a faux suede and this isn't like a
really nice nudey pink and it's got
little slits at the side and it also
comes with a matching skirt and what I
love about it is that actually it's not
overtly cropped its crop but not like
hello everyone here's my stomach and my
belly button beautiful and then there is
their whole the new cut Nicole
collection as well from misguided that
everyone is wearing and talking about
it's nice and I'm sure you can get a
couple of where a good couple of wears
out of it but um it's really really
flattering for those of you who want a
womanly sexy figure missguided has got
so much stuff there that really does
like hit that mark then also bought
another matching two-piece set which is
this one here the top is a really nice
CREP top this is actually really good
material that will wash fine like
million times and it's just this boxy
top and it also comes with the matching
boxy skirt that is super cute weirdly
enough I found another wrap top as well
this is in a black and it's so so
beautiful this was really cheap as well
but I've already worn it like a meaning
times like it's so so comfortable to
wear finally I just bought this little
shift dress which is kind of got a
crocodile print on it
how nice is that people how nice is that
okay it's time for me to take these off
okay I feel bored without it now some of
you might know I have a JustFab monthly
pic as well and this mum this was for
October I got this bag here and what I
love about it it's just one that you can
just swing on the side it's quilted it's
super plain and simple but like it just
can fit everything in it when I saw this
on the side I knew that if it was it one
you it was my perfect pick and then I
actually got these as my sip my
September pick everybody has been asking
me about them I did I did a picture on
my Instagram every was like where the
shoes on where the shoots wrong they're
just about people they're just Ferb and
I'm sure they still have them I'll link
them below these are my every single day
of the bull shoes and make me feel like
I look fire even where need I love them
next I just bought a big bag from Zara
I've been really looking for a really
good big bag but one that isn't heavy
some bags are heavy when you're empty
how are you gonna be heavy and empty
will let alone when I put my laptop and
everything inside of it but this bag was
is really really night when there's
nothing in it which means that it stays
like even long not light but it's not
gonna be really really heavy like some
bags are which is really annoying next I
went to American Apparel I really wanted
some high-waisted skinny on mom jeans
and I found them they've got a really
good classic shape these are them
they're so so gorgeous and I like them
people say I've got shorts I did a
really cool project with Reese and I'm
gonna link here in the description bar
below so you guys can see it so many
things I'm linking below just check out
the description box okay people it's got
everything you need
it's got everything you need okay and
but I did a really cool project with the
guys at Reese and it was from their
fashion night out and I basically picked
some items that I was able to wear for
this shoot that went on their site so
number one I picked this really gorgeous
little bag and of the bag because it's
like I can wear in
day or in the night and it's got like
gold hardware on it it looks very fancy
but isn't too too much loads of people
have seen these on me because I've been
wearing them literally every single day
it is these beautiful beautiful leather
trousers when I tell you the level of
beauty is real the level of duty isn't
real and finally I've got this or live
leather jacket I don't think the color
is picking up as well as it probably
should but this jacket this is another
moment of Tears people moment of tears
when I saw this leather jacket because
you guys know I buy one every year and I
have spent probably in about maximum 150
pounds on the jacket this one is a
little bit pricey but it's one of the
jackets that will kind of stay in your
closet forever so I'm so glad that they
gave this to me and sticking with it
theme of coats I have two coats from
River Island one is this oversized
really long and kind of what do they
call this color camel camel colored
jacket gorgeous winter is coming winter
is totally coming I'm already wearing
this so it's all good I love it and then
it's also this oversized navy blue one
with like camel detailing on it I love
the color tartan effect that this jacket
has and it's got such a really cute
shape as well it's a really really good
piece and my buy of all buys are my
Steve Madden heels these were also on
ASOS and it's funny there was an
Instagram picture that I saw this gosh
it amazing amazing amazing shoes right i
reposted it I was like on my Instagram
guys I love these shoes I want to find
them I was looking for them couldn't
find them but then I found these which
are basically very very similar to the
style of shoes that I had on my
Instagram so these are my alternatives
that I'm very very happy with finally I
bought a pair of friends headphones
sadly I took them back because they were
in the white and I was like you know
what my makeups gonna get all over these
but they have this gorgeous gorgeous
pair and I thought to myself these are
beautiful but I have loads of headphones
so I'm gonna do a giveaway on these guys
I'm gonna do a giveaway on my Facebook
and on my Instagram because YouTube is
not
place to do and giveaways anymore sadly

won competition so that they can get
access to their email account and I'm
sorry if that has happened to you but I
am going to do it only on my Facebook
and only on my Instagram so make sure
