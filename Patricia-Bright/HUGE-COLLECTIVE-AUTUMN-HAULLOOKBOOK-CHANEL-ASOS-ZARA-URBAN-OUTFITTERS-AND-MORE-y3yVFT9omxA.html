have a lovely hole for you and we've got
some expensive bits we've got some
affordable bits we've got swatches
because oh we've got Urban Outfitters
you guys should know we got everything
in this hole this is a really good one
and I loved it holes like this that are
just before like September and like the
autumn season so it kind of gives you
guys something back-to-school
inspiration as well it's just it's just
one of those everything whores okay so
just get ready get comfortable get a cup
of tea you might want to pause this
video and it's kind of going to be a
whole book as well cuz I'll want to wear
the looks you know weather looks for you
guys so you can sleep up there on try
before you buy and so yeah as I say get
a cup of tea get comfortable and enjoy
the video so first things first
it's my Chanel boy bag and yes this is a
pressie bag and I just really wanted to
buy this bag and I wanted a boy bag
probably for about a year and a half to
two years but every time I've gone in to
buy it say if I went to Selfridges or
Harith or something it was just really
really expensive because of the designs
that were available but there's lots of
different styles of the boy bag and the
one every time I went in to go and look
for it and it was the like the style I
didn't want or style I couldn't afford
so I was in the airport we went to the
mall DS as mentioned and I think you
guys have seen my video and then I went
in and I saw this one as I'm I like felt
absolutely in love when I saw this I was
like this is exactly what I want like a
classic boy bad but with a little bit of
an added edge and this has got Payton
round the sides but it's all black and I
love the fact that them the chain is
more of a dusty silver and if it's even
syllable but it's kind of a rustic
silver bust it's like bright gold or
bright silver so I picked this up and I
got it duty free I always buy stuff
duty-free because you save so much money
on it than if you buy it in the store so
this is my Chanel boy bag I might do
what's in my bag so
just leave a comment below if you want
to hear what's in my bag I'm just so
excited to have a Chanel boy bag and I
do have another Chanel which is more of
a classic design but I'm probably going
to set it on eBay or depop I'm going to
sell it online so when I bought this one
I knew that I had to sell my other one
to be able to afford both of them but
yeah it's a really beautiful bag and I
hope I have it for a very long time so
after that I've got some goodies from
Zara and I realized I don't shop in Zara
that much I used to but I mean I think I
got a bit bored of it I think it's quite
one-dimensional so um yeah I've not
really been shopping there but I'm
trying to buy some stuff for the whole
season
and for the whole season for the full
season and might fashion me so number
one I bought my first show
if anybody knows me I have a black one
of these it's not real fur by the way
I've had this show for like three years
but mine's all matted and full of
Darcy's looking ugly but when I bought
it I bought it for ten pounds or like
$12.99 and then the year after it was
1999 and now it's $29.99 depressing but
the reality is that yet after three is
you will need another one and this one
looks kind of foxy don't you think I
think it looks like a fox well it's not
worth what so I really like this like to
wrap up over a jacket and stuff when I'm
feeling chilly and they really do make
the difference and they really do keep
you warm and I also just bought an
oversized kind of Jack here and I just
wanted something really nice and camel
for like the transition season and I
just thought that this was a really nice
waistcoat to wear so be honest it is
quite expected this is 79 pounds but I
think it's one of those statement pieces
that I can have in my closet for the
full season after that I bought this
Brown bad I really do like the kind of
70 style that's in fashion I just wonder
this bag was really really pretty
without being my to trying it and it
also has like a long handle and strap in
it as well which makes it much easier to
wear on my clothing so I'll just take it
out my brace gonna realize I've got
literally makeup all over my teeth which
so annoying but it's absolutely fine and
I think I sound better without my brace
what are you gonna sleep but those of
you guys who have been asking I have had
Invisalign and my last train tray it's
taken me about four to five months has
been really quick but I'll talk about
all of that in later videos well I hope
you guys don't mind like nice well yeah
anyway so the next place is Urban
Outfitters I've been loving Urban
Outfitters and I think it's because I've
actually enjoyed going back to store
nowadays because I physically leave my
house more and go into the stores and
have a look and I feel like I'm just
experimenting a little bit more and ever
felt Outfitters is on my radar as just
amazingness and I know lots of people
know how good it is I feel like the
quality of the product is amazing so let
me stop raving let me just show you this
tea I'm loving all things camel I am a
trend fan and I know we're coming into
the four season and 70s is really big so
this t-shirt is just a gorgeous t-shirt
it's fitted so well and the quality is
so good it's like so soft but you know
it's not going to go bubbly and you know
it's not going to go or stretched and
all weird and horrible so yeah and then
put another tee which is just gorgeous
because it's got this black detailing
around the net and also around the
sleeves again it's just a really nice
red brick amity when I feel like it's
going to be one of those tees that you
can just throw on my jeans and look
really good you know after that I mean I
picked up this skirt and it's kind of
like an a-line style skirt it is another
trendy piece but I feel like it's with
when it comes to trends you have to pick
the things that you can wear and you
know you could wear even if it wasn't a
trend and I love scarf I love dresses
I'm a girly girl at heart
and I just thought this was really nice
and I love the kind of full burg red
color which is just so pretty and after
that I bought this turtleneck dress
again it's kind of a line in style and I
love dresses like this because I can
just throw them on but why this one's
extra specialist because it's got a
little bit of swag cleavage at the back
so if you don't to show your front
cleavage just go ahead and show your
back cleavage and then I also bought
myself a dumb
redress I think these are the absolute
cutest things ever I saw in the fro
wearing one and I was like oh my god
like I am convinced I need to get me one
and you can find them everywhere but I
just really liked the denim and the
style and the fit of this one that I
found there other than that I bought
myself a little one side tree I am
loving all things green I've got this
also tree I've got lilies behind me I've
got cacti in front of me I've got a
spider plant down there I've got chilli
prod downstairs my house is literally
turning into a greenhouse but there's
something about plants that just make
you feel good like it makes you feel so
Zen it just makes everyone look
beautiful so anything that I cannot grow
and give life makes me excited and then
I picked up this little just a notebook
really they've got so many really nice
bits and bobs and if your person like me
I love a couple of bits and bobs you
know just buy a couple of bits and bobs
and notepads or something I can't get
enough of because I'm always writing
notes so after that I actually picked up
a Larson and Jennings
watch I've been wanting one of these for
absolute the ages I waited on it and
this is an expensive piece and then
there's the silver and the gold but I
had a feeling that a rose gold was going
to come out and the rose gold came out
and I've got it here it's just the
beautiful lace dainty watch ever after
that I have two polishes from Sonny I
don't actually know how to pronounce it
so someone let me know and but I've got
cherry berry and Pamplemousse I have
loads of their polishes they're very
good botanical nail polishes they're
great for the nails
I've stopped wearing my false ones and I
just been like looking after them I've
been getting manicures very regularly at
dry by which I absolutely love I'll link
it down below you guys have to check
this place out but um I've just been
buying nicer polishes just to keep doing
because my old collections are so ugly
and just crusty and I feel like I just
need some new fresh stuff to bring in
some fabulous to my nail game after that
I have my new GHD platinum styler and if
you guys have been watching me for long
enough you know that I have THD
everything
the color ones I had the blow-dryer I
have the last styler this is the new
style ni but yet I have to get this I
mean I really do love GHG I feel like
their products a really strong and good
product and you know I have to get the
new things when they come out I'm that
kind of fan girl when it comes to
straighteners and stuff and I can you
know straighten my hair I feel like it
you don't have to use so many passes it
does it very quickly but I can also
create let loose tousled court curls
like this very easy to do is what the
straighteners look like and they're
white and they're super sleek after that
I've got some bits from ASOS
unfortunately only some of my stuff came
and I don't know what the other stuff is
it's a limbo I'm so annoyed right now if
I really wanted to show you all the
things and all the amazingness I ordered
I might link the stuff down below just
so you can see it anyway but number one
I have just been loving all things job
sue I'm going to live in a jumpsuit
forever now that's like my new thing my
uniform is a jumpsuit and this is a
really gorgeous jumpsuit in like a soft
baby pink then I'm worried because I
want to save this for New York Fashion
Week but you guys are seeing it first
and it's actually culottes jumpsuit and
it's just the most beautiful pastel baby
pink and it's just got such an elegant
cut and then I picked this other one up
which is this chat jumpsuit as well
again this is probably something I'm
gonna wear drink fashion week I'm trying
to buy pieces that are a little bit
stand out but that I feel comfortable in
because I hate when you go so at Fashion
Week or two shows and just everyone just
dress up like it's not that deep like
just relax wear what you feel
comfortable in you don't know be dig in
every corner of your like armpit and
butt crack you know out could you or
something that doesn't fit you out these
are either you're gonna either love or
you're gonna ever hate but I am in love
of these are really really pretty
now I'm loving anything that is kind of
fluff ball or has like pom-poms or
anything on it and these I mean I'm not
a big fan of glitter like you know what
I like I let the glitter be because
these are just the most cutest thing
it's got this fluff down the middle and
it's kind of you know pinky and glittery
and for me I was going to do an allpass
doll outfit look at me giving my outfits
away I was going to do an allpass tall
outfit
and I just feel like this would just be
a pretty thing to wear and you're gonna
have fun once in a while like all my
shoes are like plain just strap the
black shoes as a sight come on Patricia
it just you know live a little okay it's
fine not everyday black and white and
then I bought these as well which are
just a nice open toe sandal they
extremely comfortable and it extremely
affordable aids also actually so new
look online and you guys can't sleep on
you look because they do some of the
best Footwear that's really trendy but
also really really affordable finally I
just bought these black strappy heels as
well I've got lots of open toes that are
strappy and I just don't have a pair
that are covered as well
I seen these on the side like loads of
times and I know that they're really
nice pair I think I've seen quite a few
guys wear them and they look buff in it
as well so yeah those are those the last
clopin bit I have is this jacket from
revolve clothing you guys know I am kind
of new to the brand but really liking
the pieces and it's just this gorgeous
oversized jacket I love the monochrome
detail on it I love the oversized
neckline and I just feel like it's just
a nice dad that piece for the Fall
after that I have some goodies for
Sephora I was in at new york for a
period of time only for a couple of days
actually but obviously i have to hit up
sephora and try and get some bits and
bobs for you and I bet you've been
saving this bag this bag is a rusty
right but now I've been saving it for so
long because and I just throw in so many
beauty products in here nowadays but I
wanted to show some of the things I have
number one is this still our say day
liquid lipstick and I'm absolutely
loving liquid lipsticks you know you
will love the matte kind of glosses and
this is just a really nice nudey naked
color but it's got some flecks of like
kind of silver in it to kind of give you
a bit of a 3d look another product I've
been loving is from boxer and this is
revealed ray always wears it so it's my
moment she always wears this color and
you guys know she's literally the queen
of lippy and this looks so good on her
and there's another color called naked
that doesn't suit me so much but
revealed really did suit me it's a
really nice matte nude
in after that I got the Kat Von D eye
contour palette now Kat Von D is like
super popular we don't have the brand
here I don't think we can get it onto
four and mine so I just wanted to get I
think I just got a bunch of things that
just had gap Kat Von D or their but let
me just see what I can get and so I got
this eye contour palette
are you also in for a daily blush
Krenzel spray this is sephora own brand
and for me I you know I'm always you
know using loads of different brushes
and I don't have time to clean them all
the time so it's all this like spray-on
brush cleaner which I'm going to put
inside my makeup bag if you guys don't
know I don't really have a makeup
collection even what I basically have
one bag I put everything in and it comes
out and about with me when needed I
might go through it one day if you guys
want to see it but I tried like I've
cleared out so much what you see behind
me is basically my makeup collection and
that's it and cuz I have a clear out you
know Oh after that I bought the Kat Von
D concealer and this is what this looks
like it's more like aid creamy concealer
and I feels really nice that they had
you know my skin tone as well but I feel
like in America you just get everything
in every shade res in England and they
forget that there were brown people here
and I also bought an own brand Sephora
and nail polish formula X this color is
called exquisite and it's kind of like a
movie pink I might love in pink I'd see
I'm wearing pink and then I picked up
the tinted brow gel from Anastasia
Beverly Hills this is in the color
expresso I've heard so much about this
and for me I'm really trying to really
make my brows work for me and you know
filling them out a bit more and just
trying different things because you know
IRA just use the pencil I'll go to the
gel now I'm like I'm going to go into
this and I love just changing up what I
do to my brows to make them look
different and I have got a brown video
coming up real soon
and then sticking to the brow products I
also bought the dip brow pomade also
from Anastasia Beverly Hills so I've
also got some products from Illamasqua
I've been really loving Illamasqua as
well I'm a lip product fan and they've
just got really nice
pencils this is a really nice movie
liner and then I also picked up a kind
of a dark a dark movie as well so I can
make layer and create different looks
and I also have this gloss which is in
fire and I wish I'd put this color gloss
on now because this is much more of a
stronger red than the red I have one the
red I have ones a little bit dark but
this is like a really fiery red which
I'm just gonna layer on right now it's
so so so beautiful so guys that is it
for me this is my kind of haul but for
that the for season and for Fashion Week
I hope you guys enjoy I feel like I
always miss stuff out and then I have to
save them for ages till next month which
is so so annoying but if I miss them I'm
sorry that you'll see them next month
and I try to link everything down below
but stuff sells up so quickly that you
can't really get it in time but I'm
gonna try and like make sure that when I
do do hauls I get the stuff closer to
the time actually filling the void video
and not like a month in advance if I'm
doing is I feel like I've needed to have
like a nice chance now and I guys and

look coming up real soon

the end of the world so um yeah keep
