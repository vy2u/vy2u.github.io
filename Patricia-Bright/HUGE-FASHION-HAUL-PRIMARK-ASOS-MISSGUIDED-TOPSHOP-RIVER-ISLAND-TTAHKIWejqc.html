video I'm excited I am about doing this
haul because I haven't done a haul for
like four months or something like that
and who's the likes of my favorites so
if the light is changing or whatever and
thank you so much for the love on the
last video I did I'm gonna link it and
about being the ugly friend I got so
many comments on that that's my best
performing video of all time knit you of
all time and I realized what it is is
that so many people just relate to being
that person so more power to us girls
who were maybe the ugly duckling and now
for likely swans from the inside out or
whatever and honestly there's no offense
to anyone by using the word ugly it's
just a word that is kind of used by
society I don't like the word very much
myself either but if you guys haven't
seen it please do but I was so happy
with love and it makes me so excited to
continue to do YouTube and make videos
and all that kind of stuff anyway today
I'm doing a haul I'm standing up I've
got a rail beside because I got a lot of
stuff I've got a lot of stuff so I'm
gonna show you what I've got and it's
from some of our favorites we've got the
Azoff so you've got the Topshop it got
the misguided we've got the Primark so
I'm gonna show you everything and I
thought that if I stand up it's easier
to see the items when I kind of show
them so get comfortable get your cup of
tea I've got a cosplay here actually oh

a cup of tea and yet this is gonna be
the whole game your payment paper as
well okay I'll have links in the
description bar below so let's get
started so the first stop is a sauce I
kind of went coat crazy I think I got
this stuff at the in like January and
basically I've bought two big oversized
coats this is an oversized monkey jacket
and then this is just an oversized Azoff
own-brand
jacket and these are really long like to
mid off my calf and I love jackets that
are like this and I don't play with the
cold people the cold is not my
and so I felt like I really wanted two
really big oversized jackets the next up
I just bought some like casual basic
crewneck jumpers I really like little
jumpers like this and these are
long-sleeve and they're slightly cropped
they got it in the gray and I got it in
the black as well I've also been liking
trousers a lot more but I like kind of
fitted cigarette trousers so I picked up
these ones they've got the zips on the
front like this and they kind of come in
at the bottom they're nice and fitted I
actually love the way these look on and
it's not everyday wearing jeans some
days you need to wear trousers
especially for those of you guys who
work but you don't want to wear like the
ugly like flare style trousers
I love cigarette trousers like this
because they fit so well and make the
booty extra nurse so I also wanted to
show this little Bradley it's the Calvin
Klein umbrella I bought it on ASOS calm
this sells out so much I know loads of
girls are always trying to find this so
you might have to have a look online I
will try and see if I can find the link
but this is the one I have
so people I'm loving trainers a lot more
and like Nikes are my favorite I picked
up these flat shiny pair for their
little bit girly as well so I really
liked about them and I'm gonna tell you
something and basically in developing a
little bit of a bunion in one my foots
and sad times I'm a little bit like
Patricia it's not everyday tight shoe
and it's not everyday heel so you might
see me wearing trainers a lot more but I
thought these were a really nice girly
pair of Nikes little high-top they look
great the skinny jeans and all that kind
of stuff so user next up it's misguided
and it's another oversized long jacket I
basically bought one in black beige and
gray my favorite colors and yeah it's
just a nice really sleek one I did like
an Instagram with this one and everyone
asking me where it was from
it's from misguided it was sixty pounds
I also bought another pair of skinny
high-waisted trousers that I can wear to
work or something like that and people
always ask me about this wrap top and I
have it in gray as well so I'm misguided
as well born it months ago so I'll see
if it still there
but I will link it in the description
bar below okay so moving on to Topshop
I'm gonna show you some of the bits that
I got from Topshop number one is this
crew like long midi dress this dress is
so so nice and it's only 22 pounds and
it's kind of like a bluey gray color and
it's ribbed and it's really fitted I
wore this one I went away I felt very
sexy very sexy and I think it just looks
really nice with like a leather jacket
or like an oversized cardigan it gets
the booty pop in it's just all on point
so this dress is really nice and it's so
affordable again transfer obsess it for
Trisha I bought another pair of skinny
track with it basically what I do is try
to get nice all the basic colours of
something so black gray and beige I'll
get those kind of colors in every kind
of style that I really like so I got a
beige pair of the skinny trousers as
well now this is my by the level of
excitement Israel this is expensive
okay this was 110 pounds but it's the
one don't watch their Primark hanger so
18 pocket so I don't watch that but this
is so nice y'all know that leather men
leather have been like this one day and
you know I love the way this looks I
love the way this feels
I'm waiting for it to get a little bit
warmer before I actually wear it yet 110
pounds but it's just got that kind of
sexy biker feel to it and what I need is
I can oversize john-paul like underneath
and then I'll just throw this on that's
me spring gonna get on my bike you know
here is this Furby jacket as well
I love these Yeti jackets in the
wintertime and this was on sale this
went down to 50 pounds I believe so this
is a really nice one I also bought some
mule sandals from Topshop as well
they're in the mule star I really like
them they're very comfortable as well
because the heel is actually quite thick
but there isn't a platform next up has
to be one of my favorite stores and it's
river island and what I've realized with
River island is that they don't scrimp
on quality their stuff is fills a lot
better than a lot of other people's
stuff like genuine
when you get in life sometimes when you
buy online and it comes home you're like
what is this rubbish material I never
feel like that with anything that I get
from River Island online for some reason
they just focus on the quality and
they're not even that pricey so I am
have a lot of respect for River Island
as a brand but I got this oversized
jumper that kind of could be worn as a
dress or maybe probably not probably not
but it's a nice oversized jumper and
then I bought this kind of long kind of
dressy thing that you probably have to
wear over skinny jeans or leggings but I
just liked the way it looked enough
things like a little bit floaty and
muumuu and like one day when I have a
baby I could still be really like fresh
and fashionable by wearing things like
this and it's got a little split at the
side as well so you can't wear it on its
own and then I did a blog post in Paris
wearing this when it was my birthday
sorry it's a little bit blown out it's
this little crop top and this fitted
skirt and you might not be able to see
some of the detail but it's got like
really nice lines and like knitting in
it that looks really good and the
materials amazing finally I got a few
random bits this is a top that I bought
from other Outfitters Urban Outfitters
is fast becoming one of my favorite
stores as well but it's a little bit
pricey I'll be real with you okay but I
saw this polo-neck
cutoff sleeve jumper and I was like that
is so me it's kind of in a pinky color
and I just loved it so I had to buy it
and then I went to miss Selfridges which
I don't go into a lot and they had some
really nice pieces and this is this
cropped over the shoulder top a lot of
you guys have seen me wearing this quite
a few times so next it's Primark
as well he only got a few bits I don't
have the patience sometimes in primer
but you can go in there and quickly find
some great things but I saw my friend
and she had so many nice things from
Primark I was like why didn't I see any
of that but you know I'll go there
another day so I bought this oversize
cardi so it's just this oversized long
cardigan and if you're like me I love
just throwing long oversized cardigans
over random things it's a great way to
keep warm and to look quite stylish as
well
I bought another judge so what I loved
was the pattern that is all over it I
don't know if you can see the pattern on
it it's really really nice and I just
love the cut of this jacket as well I
know that probably when it's a little
bit warmer
I'll wear this all the time because it's
quite light so I saw this little top and
what I love is the material it's that
really kind of thin like slouching
material that kind of sticks to a bit
like brandy melville that's what this
feels like and it's got a little zip up
the neck as well and then finally I
found this little vest and what I liked
about this was the neckline on this as
well because it comes down just around
the sides gorgeous I love that neckline
finally they've got 1 pound eyelashes in
there so I basically bought like four
pairs of eyelashes I'm gonna see how
they go like and maybe I'll just do them
in a look and you guys let me know if
they look really bad but they're one
pound eyelashes now some eyelashes are
$5.99 what am I gonna pay $5.99 when I
can get five for 99p not necessarily bad
but they're not very expensive and I
think they're like definitely a well for
buy so finally I went to Mac and got a
couple of bits that I wanted to talk up
on this I don't have its a CC powder and
it's a primer powder dog correcting one
it's kind of an orangey one I use that
underneath my eyes right now and also
for a lip pencil it's night morph
I haven't had a night off in my
collection I think I've run out of night
loft so I bought one of those and I
bought a lipstick called film not I'm
loving the kind of dark Browns and the
vampy Browns and this is called film
noir and I just think it is a gorgeous
color on me some ground I'll be honest
with you do not look good on me you know
how everyone's wearing brown lipstick I
can't wear brown lips it the way that
you know other people were don't know it
just looks like I'm sick so good be
careful there buddy I've got this lip
varnish from Topshop it is so so
gorgeous and it's the color that I'm
wearing now it's a really vibrant violet
I love love love it so also from River
Island I got a couple of jewelry pieces
as well these are gold above the knuckle
ring but they're really really nice and
they're really affordable they're from
like 399 to $5.99
and I always lose jewelry so I don't
spend a lot on jewelry that I'm gonna
take off unless it's like say an
engagement ring or something like that
but I never take off other rings I will
always always lose I never like to spend
a lot of money on like jewelry like that
because it would just disappear so guys
that is the end of my whole video I hope
you liked it in this format I find it's
a little bit easier to do this and if
there's no like rustling through my bag
and all that kind of stuff so thumbs up

don't want me there like you know empty
