favorite as when as an online shopping
home because I realized that almost you
know furthermore all this stuff I've got
here I actually bought all online in
February and there's some great things I
really want to share with you and I'm
gonna give you a quick update because
I'm sure I look really different and
yeah I'm wearing lighter hair like so
from the wavy hair to like to hair I'm
really excited to try and do new things
I'm preparing to go on holiday and I was
like why not do something a bit
different and be a little bit braver
with the color and I went to edu studios
to have my hair done
I'll put a link in the description bar
below it was a custom color done by the
stylist there and I just love it like I
love the look I love the the movement
and the body and you guys know I don't
like those are really thick hair but
it's a little bit more glamorous and I'm
back in my room which has had a reject
I'm hopefully gonna do a makeup and a
studio tool and my kitchen is done so
life goes on and hopefully I can be more
consistent and have a video at least
every Wednesday and every Sunday and
there might be a treat video as well so
let's get started so first things first
is this really nice blue top which I
bought from Topshop and it's just a
knitted cropped top and it's got
matching skirt but the matching skirt
didn't suit me and it was 35 pounds and
I just love how pretty it looks it looks
so pretty and so girly and this blue is
basically becoming my favorite color as
you can kind of tell for my nails stuff
actually wasn't on line but you know
whatever this top I love it's from Zara
again it's slightly cropped but not too
caught it's a long sleeve top with
really nice ruching detail I bought this
for fashion week and I've washed it one
time it was really well I'm really happy
with that but I love these trousers that
I found I am a person who loves leather
I love black
detailing on the knee for some really
odd reason there kind of just a mid way
so they're not high-waisted like I
usually like but what I really liked was
the knee detailing on this in the lever
and at least it's not completely leather
trousers so for those of you who follow
me on my blog and make sure you do it's
Patricia Bronco UK I have a lot of posts
on there and I often wear most of the
clothes you see me in like often the
clothes you see me in my halls will
definitely be on my blog but and this
kimono here I bought on sale on Topshop
it is the most beautiful kimono ever and
you guys would have seen it might get
ready with me video which I'll link
below I just love this kimono I love the
detailing I love the coloring and love
the way it looks against my skin I love
this kimono and it went down from sixty
pounds to thirty pounds I was like this
is I couldn't believe it wasn't sold out
literally I think it might be sold out
now though but you never know I'll put a
link to everything in the description
bar below so I was contacted by a
company could miss current who do body
con dresses and I'm so so on body con
dresses but when I saw these bodycon
dress is I was like only to have those
in my life and they really do live up to
the mark I've had messages from girls to
say how can I look like I have curves
girlfriend yeah yeah curves for days
it's a really thick really nice fabric
like it's not crap fabric it's really
nice fabric and it's just so flattering
and it like sucks everything in and just
they're just amazing I got this dress in
the Navy and I also bought one in a red
now it has quite a deep V obviously and
you know me and my boobie department so
it needs a little bit of you know boobs
boobs are cool tape and but it's just
beautiful so next it's my JustFab pick
for the month this was for February and
I really like this bag I love the
color of it I love the size like it's
mini and it's also got shoulder straps
as well
I want bags though a little bit smaller
and just a little bit softer when you're
carrying them you know out and about
sometimes bad just become so heavy and
that that item from Topshop is this
t-shirt I wore a similar t-shirt in
another video and you guys really
complimented me and made me feel so good
about myself in wearing a bit more color
I think people really like that and so I
bought this top from Topshop and I just
loved the color I love the neckline
I love the design it's very very me it's
quite cool but feminine at the same time
and yeah that was fun calm and the
material gold the material is just
flawless I don't know what this is well
it's so soft so from a zooss I bought
this coat this is my the year I love
this coat it is a grey coat which is
kind of furry it's just soft you know
it's just if I can oversized coat I got
it in a size 8 a really nice soft coat
nice fabric nice material and it's
really flattering I love this kind of
grey if you're builders if you're into
the whole like pastel colors but don't
want to wear Pink's greens and blues
grey is a great alternative
so virgos lounge is a brand that I've
loved and if you want style and you want
design and you want intricate beading
they are the place to go and I got this
dress which is literally and my cry it's
that good it's such a beautiful dress
and it's just so elegant I can't wait to
wear this and it's got it's it's really
heavy because it's literally fully fully
beaded and it's one of the dresses that
you have like you have one piece like
this in your closet and I'm so glad if I
have it I love it it's kind of off the
shoulder and it just fits it fits like a
glove without being tight so I love that
I also got a
outfit from AQ AQ and i saw one of the
girls from what's that band called
Little Mix wearing the trousers don't
know she was wearing the jacket as well
it looked amazing
I love the trousers I posted them on my
Instagram people dumped them the pattern
on them is just so cute and it's so so
comfortable kind of look like a pimp in
it but pimpin pimpin so I also wanted to
share a pair of shoes of you that
virtually changed my life I love these
shoes I'm loving the midi heel or trend
and these shoes are from and other
stories and I bought them online now the
thing about and other stores is that it
comes from the Netherlands so it takes a
long time to come back and you if you
have to return anything it takes really
really long and it's quite complicated I
still haven't got my refund but at least
I got these bad boys these shoes that
camera doesn't do them justice i what on
the first day that i wore these
everybody stopped me I swear it like
four people like I know the shoes wear
your shoes on because they're so unique
and they're so comfortable so I really
like the color they're in a navy blue
they have a MIDI Hill and they have
really chunky ankle strap I went to
River I learned and I bought some
bikinis their bikini connection was
actually really really cute and I was
like I must get something but I found
this bikini though and it kind of
reminded me I'm actually getting some
bikinis from triangle it's an Australian
band but it really reminded me of the
triangle style in terms of the black and
a bold color I love this and the
knickers or the bottoms that come with
it are really comfortable I did have to
go a size up on the bottom but I had to
get smaller the tops I've got a size six
for the top and a size 10 for the bottom
and then I bought this now the reason I
bought this is because I feel I could
Caribbean Tropicana lady like I should
have pineapples and bananas in my hair
you know you know that lady right yeah
that's this
and the trousers are the trousers the
bottoms are really high-waisted they
look really vintage and just really
flattering and cool and then it was just
another another kind of simple one that
I bought here it's black with white
detailing in again it kind of gives me
that same triangle vibe to it so I don't
know if they were copying it but really
flattering it's got some nice bits of
padding in there so I won't have to much
nipple action on show so I'm going about
that so let's move on to some favorites
the first thing I really want to share
with you are my escrito lashes these are
the only lashes that I currently wear
I've been wearing these probably for
about two months or three months now in
every video these are the lashes and
they're mink lashes and they're so
beautiful like they're just so fluttery
soft shiny and the only thing I will say
is that the band can get a little bit
hard and because they're quite thick but
I like that because it kind of looks
like liquid liner on the top but they
have so many beautiful designs of lashes
that you really can't go wrong with
these and I'm running out and I'm like I
need more I need more they're mink
lashes and they basically lost forever
if you've not like me and lose them so
the next product I really like is the
the ICO skinny mini liquid liner this
came in my Birchbox for Feb you I think
I smell February or for March but this
liquid eyeliner it's literally a felt
tip liquid eyeliner and it means that
you can do much better precise cat eyes
basically without making a mess of
things and I really have struggled to
find the perfect liquid eyeliner when I
put this on I like my proven food it was
so so good
next it's my clinic deep comfort body
lotion now there are two reasons why
this is my favorite number one the
dispenser I'm never going to ever buy a
body lotion that's in the tub ever again
when I can get one right
like literally in the morning I have a
shower it's like pump pump
moisturize pump pump moisturize pump up
moisturize but it's a really nice
moisturizer it's really light so if you
have really dry skin you may need to
like layer up with some oil or something
I lay up on my hands but other than that
I really do love this moisturizer
another product from Clinique is their
super defense in the SPF 20 it's a daily
moisturizer and I use this on my face
every day it's again really liked as
well and it's just my daily moisturizer
and it's my go-to for my face and if I'm
feeling dry then I might change it to
something else but on a normal day basis
this is where I would go
so my next favourites are some things
from Sigma which it's really really
surprising because I haven't used Sigma
products in a really long time and they
sent me a collection for Christmas and I
hadn't actually used it until recently
and I absolutely fell in love it's
called I think it's called the warm
neutrals palais it's got some amazing
neutrals in there and I just felt like
they were perfect I put them on they
were nice and pigmented they weren't too
powdery and they just gave me great
color payoff I was very very impressed
with this and this palette now has
graduated to like my main palette
collection like I would use this every
single day and alongside that palette
were the brushes that it came with
amazing really really nice really really
soft especially the dome utility e34
this is an amazing brush for like just
doing a smoky eye or just crease
blending I love it I've also been using
this brush to apply my eye shadows as
well so another great product I really
like is from lacquer and code and it's a
nail polish and this polish is what I'm
wearing and it's called squid ink I've
had this sitting in my cupboard for
about five months and hadn't used it use
there and literally like wherever you've
been on my life I really really like the
color it's what I'm wearing on my nails
so next it's the vitamin e overnight
cerumen in oil from the body shop this
product here is absolutely amazing I
love all yours guys who know me know
that I always like oils like I like
putting them on my face I think they're
really good for you and this is just a
beautiful one once you've cleansed your
face and you put this on it's almost
like giving yourself a treatment and in
the morning my skin feels so so supple
and soft and it doesn't feel oily in the
morning so I could come quite a big fan
of diptych alright you can't go wrong
with their candles they smell beautiful
and they also have a body care and skin
care range but I decided to pick up one
of their lip balms then they are a
little bit pricey in my opinion it's
actually 20 pounds for a lip balm but I
think it's amazing it's like a really
nice soft moisturizing lip balm and it
smells divine it reminds you of a spa
finally it's the naked glosses from
Urban Decay I have quite a few of these
and I slept on them yeah and one of
these people I just hold it out if
nothing's broken don't fix it I was
quite happy with my makeup regime gave
one to my sister I was like Maureen I
saw her second what are you wearing on
your lips and she's out all that nipple
she gave me I was like give me that no I
did make her give it back to me but it
looks so gorgeous I literally went home
use the other ones and they're just
flawless like they're so pigmented and
the nudes are just nice and nude and I
just love it
and Conor I really like is beso and
rules 34
they're really nice nudey pink that suit
all skin tones so guys that is a my
February haul and favorites I really do
hope you enjoyed and to keep up to date
