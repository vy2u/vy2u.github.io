have got a whole video and you guys know
I say this quite regularly but this is
definitely a cup of tea whole I'm just
gonna let you have your moment pause get
your tea this is going to be a cup of
tea tall because this is major there's a
lot of stuff here and there's a lot of
variety and I'm gonna even say it's hot
like it is just really hot in here right
now if I start sweating profusely during
this whole then please forgive me so I
ordered some shoes online and I'm going
to just blatantly say Tonya tails made
me do it
I'll link her channel below she did a
video on juice of the and the outer
version of these shoes and I saw them on
hotshot I was like yes I have to go and
get them these like I don't even know
what you would call them they're called
the Aladdin they're absolutely
fabulously gorgeously wonderful and I
wanted the outer ones and the other ones
that are out of stock I saw her and the
Persian babe in them and I just thought
oh my gosh these are beautiful and then
she did that video and literally
straight away I went to tops up and just
bought it before it sold out because
they were cheaper version from new look
which I'll link below which was sold out
when I tried to buy them I just love
these are kind of like gladiator sandals
shoes things and I fit they're great for
summer if you want to add a bit of edge
to your outfit and this was 72 pounds
it's a bit expensive but these are
sturdy so next I've got some bits from
misguided you guys know that misguided
is becoming one my favorite online
stores and yeah I bought some bits and
I'm gonna say if you guys want to see
the outfits I'm gonna be doing weekly
outfit posts so you'll always be able to
see at least 90% of these outfits at
some point in time so make sure you a
subscriber to see those stuff
there's firstly is this gorgeous jump
and it's kind of nine color and I also
bought the white one and it's like a
one-piece play suit and it's got these
gorgeous and scalloped legs at the
bottom there
I love it it's not too tight and it
comes with a belt I must say that the
belt that you get is weird because the
belt is straight across it looks like
some kind of just a d' belt or something
but i think that you know if I was
definitely that I'm keeping it I would
Bend this and then it would like go
around to your stomach and I would
definitely say get a size up because
they are quite tight-fitting and I've
got a belly like a potbelly so it was
quite with that I also bought this
absolutely gorgeous lace crop top and I
love it because it's not too cropped and
the lace pattern is really nice all
should wear that no that's okay yeah I
love that really nice for summer with
the high-waisted bodycon skirt or
something I love that so I bought this a
while back but I don't think I showed it
to you in a hall and might have showed
it to you and however I will take it out
but it was this neon floral dress I got
it maybe a few weeks before I went on
holiday I love it I love this dress and
this material is a really thick material
it's not like thin or flimsy really
really thick material I love it and and
you can see on my blog moments of
style.com I've got like one outfit post
with that dress on my last video I have
like a one-shouldered on top this is it
this is from misguided as well just the
cheap and for one sleeved top there
so guys let me show you my JustFab pick
these are for get for June and July I
don't think I showed you any last month
but I wanted to show you these wedges
how hot are these wedges but the design
on them is so cute it's like the black
and white patterned and then there's
this strip of yellow through it these
wedges are gorgeous I think wedges are
an essential for summer and this is my
JustFab pick for the month before I love
this bag like it came a bit late and but
that's fine but this bag is absolutely
gorgeous I did that I can Instagram with
it and everyone was like where's the bag
from where's the bag from it's from
JustFab I love it it's etched here and
it's a really really sturdy bag this
isn't a flimsy bag at all so it's great
for work I've been using this for work
there's like three set
on the inside and then there's a little
zip on the outside as well so guys I
wanted to get a little bit personal with
this hall and share a little bit and
genuinely share what I feel has helped
me and some of you guys know that I am
like I don't have the biggest boobs like
just fine and I usually do live in
padded bras because they're very helpful
at creating some shape I definitely
considered a boob job but I'm too scared
to go under the knife so you know padded
bras are the way I usually go but I
always have this thing called nip slip
and it's like from this I like and if
you guys can relate to me please let me
know because I'd only embarrass myself
but I wanted me genuinely honest and I
always have like nip slip so from the
side we can get a bit of nipped
visibility so embarrassing
but I do have that it was some of my
panic bras that I've worn in the past
and I'm just like I'm so tired of always
being worried that if I lean forward or
something that the padded bra doesn't
fit quite perfectly and it's going to
cause me nip slip and embarrassment when
I was wearing like a vest on holiday and
I said oh my gosh like you can literally
see my whole new pause it's like no just
put these away so I went to this shop
called
right this is the shop Tezz endless
tears Emmys and I realized they also
have this shot in the UK but I never
used to go into that shop and they had
broth and bikinis and stuff and it was
two bras for 19 euros one bra usually is
30 pounds in this ends up you could get
one for eight pounds other oh my gosh so
girls if you have that problem that I
have of nip slip or padded bra just not
fit in public properly I basically
changed the shape of the bra that I went
for so now I go for the balcony now
connect tight tight bras and there is
still padded but instead of being like
like that like at an angle so you get
nip slip it covers from the top so you
get a lot left and you get no lipstick
NIC you get known you got it
you get no nip slip with these basically
I absolutely love it to the point that I
actually bought four new brands so I
bought one in red and I got the matching
whereas well and I bought this one it
was so gorgeous okay
how pretty is that I love the pattern on
it again it gives you some nice like
fake boob Ã¤j-- but without nip slip and
you get some good cleavage on it as well
and then I bought a black one and then I
bought a nude one as well and I was so
surprised by the price because you know
I could have spent a hundred and twenty
pounds on bras like this I only spent 40
euro that's ridiculous so I'm very happy
about that also wanted to not diss other
bras but I do have a great bra from the
center as well that I bought it's a body
kiss like it's like a seamless bra and
this is padded as well but not over
padded and this was 30 pounds and I
don't get a nip slip with this as well
so yeah I know that's random high-five
for me doing a little bra discussion if
you want me to do like a video on bras
and that kind of stuff let me know
because it is useful to some of us who
do struggle in the boobage department
you know so guys I know some of you like
shopping online as well so I've got some
stuff from she inside and they do free
international delivery which I think
everyone is going to end up doing free
international delivery because there's
no point in not being like free
international when there's so many
options out there so I got this top from
she inside you guys probably would have
seen it in my last outfit post if not it
will appear somewhere here and yeah I
love this cross over top and I bought it
in the size 10 or so I was but got it in
a size small but I believe I need a
medium it's a bit tight on the arms I
think I would've preferred a medium but
besides that you know it's absolutely
lovely the little pockets are really
cute and it looks really elegant really
nice material as well and boys and girls
I love these little cross over shorts I
know Zara sells something similar to
this but this
like half the price and I love them I
wore them on holiday I've got a really
cool blog post wearing these these are
going to be a summer staple I love these
kind of crossover shorts they're like
asymmetrical and then I also got this
top as well from she inside it's just a
nice basic tee but I like the fact that
it's got the sheer mesh and stuff around
the neckline and around the arms so guys
I've been looking for a couple of body
con dresses I've got one which is a
Herve Leger and yeah that's expensive so
I don't buy those regularly I have the
one and it's been really good to me but
I've wanted to expand a bit and get a
couple more for like when I go out and
stuff you know when you want to get
dressed up look sexy
so from Stanley celeb I got one of these
body con dresses you might have already
seen it in my get ready with me video um
I love it it's a gorgeous gorgeous rich
orange and it's got some really nice
paneling and stuff which really does
help to suck in like the else adds you
know I love it and it makes my boobs
look great as well along with my new
bras then this I'm packing so I also
went to Zara to go check out the sale
and I must say that it was giving me the
most life so firstly I picked up this
peplum top which I thought would be
really nice to work I love the pattern
on it and it's just a really nice shape
and I know some people don't like
petting them all the time but I quite
that peplum it's great for work and I've
been trying to maximize the number of
skirts I have that aren't like super
mini my skirts are already short for
some reason or I just have short so I
can't wear this work so I picked up this
skirt here and that was like 25 pounds
it was now 12 pounds and I love it it's
like a little crossovers asymmetrical
skirt as well and then I love this guy I
love this pencil skirt it's got a bit of
leather you guys know I love my lever
and then it's got this tank panel down
the front as well as down the back as
well
it's really nice and cute little pencil
cut skirt
again that was 22 pounds that's a good
bargain and then I also bought another
miniskirt again where she's got these
little polka dots on it and this one's
not too short and I think this one was
like 11 pounds this is extra extra cute
I like that one it's nice I probably
wouldn't wear that to work but I would
wear on the weekend so I went to another
online store called choices
I believe it's cool choices I'm not sure
hard to say it but I'll link it in the
description box again most of these you
can find on my blog I wore them on my
holiday post as well and I just was
trying to stock up before I went away
and I found these absolutely gorgeous
high-waisted shorts with these stripes
on it I love them I absolutely love
these shorts because of the high waist
they make your bum look absolutely great
and these are not too too short but they
really fitted with a bit of stretch
in them and I bought these in and medium
and then this Tarte I love this top it's
a shame it's not a dress but it's look
another peplum style top it's got this
bit on the bottom that's really nice
right and then it's got this slit Deeter
in the back someone thought it looked
like an Ankara no it's not but it's cute
right and then I know this dress is very
popular with some of you guys it's the
spiderweb dress that looks like this
yeah let me get my beak it away gorgeous
on gorgeous really flowy babydolls style
so that's from there as well so if the
light keeps changing the sun's going in
and out so let me quickly show you some
of the makeup products that I got as
well I went to iMac and it was really
really good fun know so many guys out
there it was so nice seeing everyone and
quite overwhelming as well but I had a
really good time it was like nice seeing
you or taking pictures and stuff so I
got some good bits
I think I feel like they got some of the
bits so NARS was crazy nas was really
really crazy and I wasn't really able to
get that much but I was able to get one
or two pallets I got this palette here
which is called surabaya and those are
kind of Browns but actually the brown
comes out a kind of reddish brown like a
burnt brown which I really really like
and I was able to get
and this palette which contains
albatross and sin together
I'm bit concerned an albatross maybe a
bit too light for me but could be good
as a highlighter but sin that's
absolutely cygnets gorgeous and very
excited to use that and then I also
purchased Coconut Grove which I love as
a nice chocolate brown to wear in the
crease it's a really like nice pigmented
one I hadn't used it and I'm very happy
with that one and then I really wanted
to try some makeup forever product so I
got the HD foundation I got the color n
180 I really really really really wanted
to try something new and I've heard a
lot about this so I picked up that and
they also picked up the full cover
camouflage concealer and I've actually
got Sammis one which is the color eight
my ones actually the carrack of color 14
and go and check out her video where she
realized that she had the wrong one it
was hilarious but yeah so mine was a
1401 was an eight and then I got the if
the loose powder which is called
star power so I also went to Engler and
I don't have anything from there before
and you were able to build your own
palettes and I think my palette was 18
pounds and I got free colors and I did
an orange a purple and already so I
wanted to show you this DVD that I
bought because I'm very proud of myself
and let me tell you the story when I was
younger I remember watching this program
that came on TV and I was maybe about 11
or 12 and this program came out on TV
and it was Bible stories and they were
really cool and used to come on after
The Simpsons and I was like I would
really like you know to watch that again
or if I had kids one day and love for
them to watch something like that typing
all this stuff and they couldn't find it
anywhere
I kept hunting intensely and found it on
Amazon and the series was called
Testament of the Bible in animation I
wanted to show you my new phone case
it's from I camisas and I need to zoom
up closer you guys can see it it's
absolutely beautiful you can kind of see
it's got like the feathers that we
blue silvery so gorgeous I went to their
website they actually sent it to me and
they've got such a gorgeous variety of
pretty phone cases I absolutely love
this it's so unique and just really
really mean as well
finally just a few items so I got the
Real Techniques Limited Editions set
which is the duo-fiber collection and
I've got the other collection and I
absolutely love them that they're
amazing so to get this set is really
really cool as well so my skin has kind
of been acting up kind of been acting up
I've been learning a lot more about
skincare and stuff like that from like
acid peels I'm going to have a lactic
acid peel as well so I might do a video
to show you how I do that lactic acid
peel but I've been just teaching myself
you guys know that I usually go for skin
as in skin products because I know the
brand quite well and I know that they
usually know what they're doing I'm
hoping to try something else but for now
I just stick with what I know and what I
like so and I've been suffering a lot
with the pores on my nose you guys nose
I have quite large pores that get quite
quarry on my nose and I hate and they're
really annoying but I've been working on
it so I've decided to kind of come up
with a three-step regime to deal with
the pores on my nose and just to even up
my skin tone a bit I've kind of got one
of those dirty tans and you probably
can't tell it's I've got makeup on but
you know it's like patchy and it's just
like yeah yeah so I bought my exfoliator
the this is the creamy one I didn't add
the gel one before but this is a creamy
one and then I bought the pore refining
lotion which contains vitamin A which is
great for just releasing the pores and
increasing cell turnover as well as it
contains glycolic acid glycolic acid is
a great BH a that helps to lipids to
break up which means that you know stuff
comes out better look at me some of you
guys might think I'm crazy but I
actually do buy SPF in fact 250 I know
and black and
and but my sister is the one who taught
me this trick because she's always
suffered from quite bad
hyperpigmentation and like acne in the
past and she swears by factor 15 and
especially if you have dark marks and
exposure to the Sun will make those dark
marks darker I've got a big black one on
my nose right now due to trying to
extract a pore and it's scarred so I'm
working on just avoiding that darkening
and hopefully getting it back to its
normal color well guys that was a big
hole wasn't it do you like that do you
like because like that I will catch up
with you guys later thanks for watching
