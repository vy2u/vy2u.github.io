sat down and chatted or duo Hall which
is what I usually enjoy doing but I do
have a haul for you today I'll probably
talk while I'm doing it and it's
basically like collective all from the
cells to what I got for Christmas and
everything else I am kind of always on
the revamp I think I'm just that kind of
person I can't always want to change so
I've been like clearing up my wardrobe
and just take new things around I'm
hopefully gonna kind of decorate my room
and my space a little bit more so
there's some things like that are
towards that and then I'm still I'm
still got more things to buy but I'm
gonna do this haul I want you guys to
get excited get a cup of tea
I've actually got popcorn in Tesco car
instead of a cup of tea and today but
yeah get comfortable and let's do this
haul so first things I'm gonna start off
with some lashes these lashes were sent
to me they're from is Guido Vickers s
yes cuido calm and basically they're
real genuine mink lashes now I've never
had lashes before but I've heard loads
about them and I actually think they are
all that they're cracked up to be these
lashes are absolutely gorgeous what the
packaging is great
it's kind of got I'll show you this one
it's like a white packaging which kind
of looks like snakeskin
it's just a beautiful copper writing and
then it's just like a normal case but I
feel like the packaging makes it a
little bit nicer then some of the paper
ones that I have and I would definitely
leave my lashes in this and it's so soft
the bands are quite thick but I really
like that and but they're really nice
I'm going to keep wearing them and I'm
going to let you know how they go okay
so I'm going to move on to Topshop first
I did get a couple of bits in the sale
there's probably two bits in here that
often oopsie
they're probably two bits here fell from
the cell number one is this jumpsuit
I'll show you on it's a one-piece
jumpsuit and I just loved it like the
colors that are on it and guys I'm going
away again I can't help myself I love
going away we are going actually to Hong
Kong and then we're going into Thailand
and again but we're going to another
Island and we're actually going with ray
and Erik so this is super super exciting
so I'm already like already in my
vacation mood like I'm thinking of
islands of thinking of pina coladas so I
thought this outfit would look
absolutely perfect is drapey it's really
cool and it's kind of trendy at the same
time so I've been a pop obsessed I
really wanted a white furry top and
Topshop I saw this top in Topshop eight
years ago and it was like 40 quid at the
time or thirty eight quid at the time
then I bought it in the sell for thirty
pounds then it's actually gone down to
15 pounds at the moment so I was a
little bit disappointed that I bought it
I might actually return it and rebuy it
just about 15 pounds difference but it's
so cozy it's so warm I can definitely
see myself wearing a lot this spring I
also bought this really cute sweater
dress I love gray and a black kind of
white perfect and I love dresses it's a
really cute let box and sweater dress
and I'm totally for wearing my dresses
in the winter even without ties it's
just the way that you wear it the
material is really thick and it's kind
of like a flop fabric as well which is
really pretty so this top is definitely
in a holiday mode I just loved the
vibrancy I love the card sleeves are a
rough edge I just love the pattern and
the vibrancy of it's so abstract and
it's inspiring me I want something like
that like in my room I'm thinking of
doing a like collage wall or something
we're just how colors that's what the
season I'm in at the moment I wanted to
share some nail polish it that was sent
to me as well it's by a brand called all
that chance and activities I've had it
in a while and actually I hadn't used it
but during Christmas I brought them out
and there
really really nice they have good stuff
so I'm really loving glitter and really
shiny nail polishes but these are
glitter in it but the glitters are so
small and it's so smooth on application
that the red is beautiful to some of you
guys might be really surprised but I'm
not a massive sale shopper and I always
seem to miss the shells or I never find
anything really nice but I did go into
Zara and I did find some goodies and I
bought this black lace dress and it's so
beautiful it's got really thin straps
again I'm thinking holiday but I'm also
thinking it's really good to layer and
it's just got these black thin straps
and it's cross over at the back and then
it also has lace on the bottom and that
was 2 9 pounds
so next I ended up picking this jumper
up it was 12 pounds in the cell and I
just really liked the color and the
pattern I'm trying to add a little bit
more color into my wardrobe and I
thought this piece would go perfectly so
I've also been looking for a jacket that
isn't black I have a lot of black
jackets or leather jacket and I found
this compromise it is navy blue and it's
got a little bit of a leather collar but
it's not like over you never like I
always wear but I love the length and
it's kind of like a woman bubbly texture
it's meant to be like that and I really
liked it it was 22 pounds I just thought
this was a bargain so for my last haul
some of you guys may know that was part
of a group who were doing a secret
Center with ebrary publishing and I'm
gonna show you some of the books that I
got right you know I become a world big
book person over the past few months I
find it really entertaining now maybe
the sound of getting out on a little bit
and but yeah these are some of the books
that Rosie Anna who's also here on
YouTube sent me so this book is called
like water for chocolate it's a novel
based out in a family in Mexico I think
there's a bit of love there's a bit of
cooking there's a bit of things also
receive this book here called daily
rituals by Mason currency and it's how
great minds make time finding
inspiration and get to work this is the
kind of book that's right up my street
I've been really working on my rituals
at the moment so it's really interesting
sting to find out how other great people
have done it I also got this book here
called hardwiring happiness the
practical science of reshaping your
brain in your life and then this speaks
basically a hundred percent to me I'm
all about being happy and I'm all about
bright life and I'd like to know what
their tips are to do that I love this I
thought this pic was so cute it's by
Chile know who won MasterChef and it's
all about Mauritius the Mauritian
cooking and for those of you who know I
had my honeymoon in Mauritius I love
love love Mauritius and I love my food
guys so I'm very excited to try a couple
of recipes from this book and then this
book here is called velocity basically
about the digital world and a couple of
tips in you know living in it it's about
octant optimism positive force that
gives you the mindset and tools to
create a better future I must say she
inside has made me really really happy
this month I won't lie to you the
package took actually four weeks to get
here I was
I usually takes a while you're usually
looking at two weeks three weeks but it
took for almost five weeks to finally
get here I ordered it in December but I
was very very happy with what I got I
bought a little furry jacket now this is
kind of to replace my GA and my upper
third jackets and I wear them all the
time and I wanted like a black remove
long hair and this like I bought this a
month back and I know this is such a big
trend
it's a boxy jumper with like um
geometric detail on it it's so in
especially in the color and especially
in the shape and the form I'm so glad
that they've got this very early very
warm and it's just got so much detail on
it or definitely be wearing that this
February as I am interested in a lot
more pattern and stuff I bought picked
up this jumper here which has got some
great pattern and some great detail on
it I've worn it about two or three times
now it's really snuggly it's really nice
and it fits great I'm like obsessed with
whites and cream for some odd reason but
I'm I picked up this top I have the
black the black is
flattering I get compliments on it all
the time I thought why not pick up the
cream as well this is like a surefire
staple that I love I should wear it
right now in two minutes it's that good
I love that you can wear something on
the inside well ideally you would avoid
your nipples I'll be hanging out but
yeah you can wear like a bra or a bikini
top or a vest or anything that you want
on the info and then if you want to just
wear nipple us go ahead what your
nipples actually done not very good not
good for the kids so I saw this on a
blog on who I'm a massive fan of can't
remember her blog thing it's really good
though she's great and she's gorgeous
and she was wearing this mic it's like a
longline jacket it's like longline Jala
so it's like pop pop woolen fabric I was
like I need to find it God went on she
inside they had it I was like I'm crying
it's so nice it's a little bit oversized
but I kind of like that I think it's
cool I did a blog post wearing it as
well you can check out my blog Patricia
bright coat UK and finally I bought this
kind of furry slouchy jacket I bought it
in a medium size because I wanted to be
over oversized it's really nice it's
like a furry material a couple of other
bits I forgot to show you
I bought this ribbed midi skirt from
Topshop as well it was 20 pounds and I
just like the length I love the ribbon
and I love the color from the Zara sale
I also bought this motif t-shirt it was
399 I think it's a bargain and it says
don't mind on it I don't really wear
motif touch shirts that much but I
really like this one I like the colors
on it and just the fit of it not really
cute and from H&amp;amp;M I saw this kind of
cropped wide sweater I thought it was
really pretty and I do like the color
yellow on me I don't find much yellow
regularly but you know what my wardrobe
looks so plain right now about it
probably means this burst of color I
love the fact that it's got all this
texture as well on the very front I love
this dress I love
this dress this dress was on sale it was
from Miss Selfridge aids it was 70
pounds and I bought it for 35 pounds
just about half price and what I love is
won the fit and it's got all this
beautiful beading again if I'm wearing a
bikini underneath and it have a little
like sit dress so you can wear little
slip dress but I'd like it a little bit
more sexier than that so I have to work
out how I'm gonna wear it so I basically
got myself a new camera let's call this
my Christmas gift what I got for
Christmas is a new camera
I have got a 60d I have a 550d which I'm
selling if anybody wants to buy my 550d
please leave a message in the murder
please send me a message on facebook we
first come first serve but I thought it
was time for me to get myself something
a little compact because I have the 60d
at the 550d and I really wanted
something that I can take away like when
I go on holiday if I want to vlog a
little bit more and I don't want to
carry a big camera like this so I was
like you know what I'm putting that away
it's time to get going
I got myself this this is based on the
recommendation of Suzy start Suzy had
this and she told me that s/he
recommended it and actually remember
that this was the camera that s/he was
using huh I'll show you it I like the
fact that the flip screen is up there so
you can see me there you guys know I get
my just fat pick every single month and
I actually picked these for December
I've gotten quite innate and they're
these really cool chunky platform shoes
depending on what's there I can just
pick something that maybe is a little
bit out of my comfort zone I love the
detail that was on there and I think
these are nice high platform shoes I'm
not quite sure where I'm gonna wear them
to who knows but they're really pretty
they're in the suede and they've got a
really big platform so they're
relatively comfortable so final couple
of beauty be number one is finally I'm
so late but
needed to replace my Bioderma this is my
micelle solution
I bought this first like two years ago
and I bought this in Spain and because
you couldn't get it here in the UK but
now it's sold here and is that the cup
of garden pharmacy in this I went and
bought this find the need to top up
so let's not to buy a lipstick this
lipstick is called flap out fabulous is
this really nice fuchsia pinky purple I
saw the lady serving Rona oh girl girl
what new wearing it's just a really nice
pinky purple and I don't really play
with color on my eyes but I'm all for
playing with color on mine it finally I
went to the convent garden they have a
new Burberry cosmetics store it's
beautiful and it's a little bit hot but
it is absolutely beautiful in there it's
just when you come in you feel so calm
me feel so relaxed everything's laid out
so beautifully honestly I didn't want to
spend too much but I'm probably gonna go
back and get a couple of other things
because the store is wonderful the
collection looks great and I'm very
excited to see what else they've got so
this is the Burberry lip cover I got the
soft satin Rouge and it's a red lipstick
and it's lipstick is called oz blood it
looked beautiful on I'm not even reading
waiting to open at the moment because
the packaging is just so gorgeous so
