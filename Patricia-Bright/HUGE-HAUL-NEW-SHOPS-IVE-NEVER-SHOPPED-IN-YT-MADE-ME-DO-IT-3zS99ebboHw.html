whole video for you and I decided this
is going to be my last haul of the year
and I cuz I just was going for my coven
I was like Patricia you have so many
clothes and I really don't wear a lot of
them I have like so many new clothes and
it's just they're like labels on and
everything and I think YouTube has this
thing of just making what you want to go
out shopping and I decided I'm gonna
just recycle and reuse what is in my
wardrobe there's no need for me to
purchase all the things I purchase isn't
ridiculous I don't even go out anymore
so I don't know where what I'm doing
with these clothes but anyway that's
around I'm still hauling today but it
will be my last haul and again this was
a little bit different because I decided
I'm going to shop where I've never
shopped before go to all stores I've
never been into before and have a look
and see what they've got and boy did I
get some fines so first of all I will
start off with I went to a monkey monkey
is a new store which has recently opened
up in Carnaby Street and I knew that I
had a bit it was opening night for
February I've not had the opportunity to
go in there but I ended up just
literally like me and Maury went in and
we were like oh my gosh this is amazing
and ended up buying loads of stuff but
I've got an excuse I'll be on honeymoon
very shortly so I can buy new clothes
for my honeymoon and just you know warm
weather other than that nothing else so
I bought this dress this white dress
this white lace dress and it's got lace
sleeves like that and I just thought it
was really pretty really feminine and it
just fit me really really well and that
was 30 pounds I think oh and the store
is
really really reasonably reasonably
priced that's why I really liked it and
then I bought this skirt
it's a teal till seems to turn up blue
on my camera for some odd reason but
it's a teal kind of like baby green and
I just loved the color that it was and I
just loved the pleats and that the
plates are folded in so you're not gonna
have the problem of when you wash them
the pleats just disappear no this will
be fine so it's kind of different I'm
looking at trying to do a bit of a
different style for myself so I also
bought these hot pants
they hot pants they're high-waisted
denim shorts and they're in a black and
they were 20 pounds and they're quite
tight again I have quite a big behind so
it's a little bit difficult to find them
but these are okay and we'll see what I
think about its long term and I bought
this polka dot shirt which I absolutely
love you guys know that I love like
chiffon II see-through material and I
bought this there I love this and the
goal in the shop was wearing in they
don't really put you in her Oh
oh yeah so I never buy motif clothing or
clothing with motifs on it just because
I hate sometimes some of the things that
they say but you guys know me I'm a
hippie whatever I don't care
our goody two-shoes I saw this vest
which said be the change change the beat
and you know things like this run true
for me I can feel proud to wear it shell
which says be the change which is what I
always tried to be and before I stop
preaching on here you know this is a
shirt that I bought then it's a
racerback vest and I thought it was
really really nice
that's why I bought for monkey so why
this is in this haul is because I
actually rarely out shopping you look
probably once a year I just got and I
really like New York not New York and
you look but I went in and this
beautiful beautiful lilac kind of loose
jumper was in there and it's like a
really thick material and it's just
beautiful look at that color and they've
got it in loads of different colors and
I just thought this was hand beautiful
finis with my American Apparel leggings
and just like some shorts just hang in
like mmm
and can have a bit of shoulder action in
this yeah I love that from new look and
again in the past I used the shop in
Banco
but I've not shopped in mind there for a
really long time but I went in there and
I found this jumper and they had a cake
muscles throwing it in in the pictures
or in advertising and she had like
yellow jeans and this beautiful peachy
cream shampoo it's in seasons colors
it's neutral this is the kind of stuff
that I love it's really big it's really
slouchy and I know it's spring but I
would just wear this and wear no jacket
and this is like lovely and gorgeous and
again would look gorgeous with
high-waisted shorts or American power
leggings there this is why it's amazing
to go to shops you've never been to
before because I've been looking for a
certain type of jacket for so long I've
been looking for a boyfriend jacket
right shape jacket with leather leather
arms or or leather collar something with
leather on it but in a really classic
style I could not find this jacket
anywhere did go into one shop and I saw
it for like 290 pounds I was right
sit sit sit down but now I can't tell
you how I got it for because my sister
is going to kill me because she said I
don't want you telling people where it's
from because she bought it as well and
she hates it when everyone else was the
same jacket is heart or same clothes as
her but I will say but I went to a very
quintessentially English traditional
English store when people come to the UK
they always go to this store not Primark
this store is very English you know it's
known for high quality and for older
ladies it's much of an older lady store
like I would say like thirty thirty plus
but I got this jacket for boys and girls
boys and girls it's got a leather color
and it's got leather arms and I just say
oh my god
like I was literally what my sister was
literally walking just walking through
to get to another shop and she was a and
then I ended up buying as well amazing
and it was 69 pounds but it's amazing
quality I can trust this brand like it's
a trusted British brand
and it's got like a single single button
there look at our my gosh guys this is
gonna just look bad on I love it again I
was sticking to the principle shop
something you don't go to Zara don't go
to new look I mean H&amp;amp;M goes on menu and
I decided to go into one of these random
stores in Oxford Circus a non brand
store and I ended up buying like through
two pairs of shoes from em and I bought
these platforms here that'll criss cross
at the front like this and I just loved
the color of them they were extremely
comfortable there are no shoes I've seen
it as comfortable as this and I think I
could wear it with a lot of things and
they were like 30 pounds so no less than
that 28 he did he did me good price good
price
he gave me good price because we ended
up buying three pairs my sister bought
these in like electric blue and then I
ended up buying these which you're going
to see me wearing all the time I love
them how can you see them they're like
wedges that really really comfortable
and they fit really really well and they
look really really expensive I don't
know if you can see but they look really
expensive and these are 29 pounds as
well so shoes so it's almost like I
couldn't resist going into my at my
beloved Zara and I did go in there I
ended up buying this dress it's like
words can't describe how fabulous this
dress is it was only 25 pounds it's like
it's a floor-length dress with lace lace
on the side like that can you see that
it's like lace cutout on the side and
then it's floor limp and then but it's
shorter out the front so really short at
the front and then longer at the back it
is just amazing on it just looks so
fabulous and I can just see myself on
the beach just
and me being not able to resist Mazzara
my baby I bought these shoes I bought so
many shoes I bought these amazing shoes
I haven't got that many going out shoes
I look pretty everything I have is
really clunky because like all of a
sudden I got obsessed of like clunky
heels and I was like I need a few more
things a bit more feminine so I picked
up these shoes which are just actually
so Zara so gorgeous there see how
gorgeous those are yeah oh my god and
the finally I went into auto I still
don't have wedding shoes I really don't
give two hoots about wedding shoes
because the thing is you cannot see any
of the shoes I'm wearing my dress is a
huge you can't see it so what's the
point in spending 300 pounds 200 pounds
on a pair of shoes that no one can see
and I'll never wear again I don't wear
white shoes or sparkly shoes like never
never wear it again so it's a waste of
money in my opinion so but every was
like you need to get Sparkle you need to
get Sparkle you get a Mon
like I hate Sparkle so I went to Aldo
and I bought these and potentially these
could be my wedding shoes now my mum's
not that impressed because she's like
it's not weight is shoe but yeah them
eyes I think I could wear them for the
wedding don't you think you can't you
literally can't see it and they're
really hard but they're really really
comfortable they've got some sparkle
there and they've got some sparkle there
if not I might take these back and my
mum said they're a bit too high but
they've got a platform and my dress is
really long anyway so whatever mm we'll
see we'll see guys but these are pretty
shoe that I would wear again after the
wedding so guys that is my haul thanks
for watching and I'll see you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
