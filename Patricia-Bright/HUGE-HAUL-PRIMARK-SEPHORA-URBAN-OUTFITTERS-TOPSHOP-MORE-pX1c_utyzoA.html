ice right actually ended up seeing
ghosts
hey guys so today I have a whole video
for you and I love doing my monthly
hoarse ugly I think they're probably
going to be every two months just
because I've realized that shopping all
the time I find that I'm almost like
shopping because I know you guys would
like it versus shopping because I really
need stuff and I know I do the videos
and everything but sometimes it's nice
to have a little bears restraint and
really buying items are really really
special so like I always say get a cup
of tea and get comfortable this is
definitely going to be a long one
because I've got stuff from all over and
I've got stuff from when I went on my
trip to New York for a couple of days so
first shop Primark right the thing about
Primark that's really annoying is that
you go in there for a particular thing I
only went to Primark because I wanted to
buy a man's hoodie and I didn't want to
spend lots of money and I got that man's
hoodie I'm gonna win everywhere else and
they got rival things that are very
worthwhile so firstly I'm going to show
you the hoodie that I bought and it's
literally because I wanted something
like super casual to wear in the house
and stuff so it's just a really basic
hoodie this and it's just really cute
and my company and stuff like that and
because it's getting colder now I just
want this something I could kind of
throw on one of the random things I
ended up picking up was these pair of
socks and I thought they were so so cute
and it was literally because I was
chewing up at the till and I saw these I
was like I've gotta have them they like
slipper socks and they've got the little
slippy things so next I saw these like
furry croc polo neck jumpers and that's
what they look like and I bought it in
the cream and I bought them in a size um
6 or size 8 because I wanted something
really small because it would be a bit
more crop if they're bigger they're a
bit baggy and I also bought it in like
the mint green as well which I thought
was so so pretty and these were 10
pounds as well so next I found this
floral dress which I've already worn and
soiled it messy
but it's amazing I love the kind of
leatherette detail on the sleeves and
just that it's a monochrome print and
I'm gonna have a lookbook with these out
with some items and up next so make sure
you watch out for that for those who
know me I love being comfy like finally
is sitting in front of a fire reading a
book and I got this cardi and I put it
in an arch because there were no s'mores
in there but I thought it was so cute
I love the pattern on it the detail is
amazing
and it's just so snuggly and cozy and
chunky and nitty and the ottoman oh so
next is on my online failure which is
she inside you guys know I shop on there
a lot but I picked up these two jackets
which I absolutely love
right so this is jacket number one which
is like it's just a beautiful drapey
jacket but I thought it was going to be
like a coat which it's not it's more of
a throw over layer with type item but I
still love it and actually I think I
prefer it like this is like a may over
thing and then this is the similar item
but it's a different material I thought
the same material but this is more cocky
army jacket style but again that's
really nice and then this jacket I
thought was like okay looking it is
amazing I love it it's kind of quilted
as well so you can wear it on its own
during autumn but this jacket is just
more beautiful in person than it looked
online so that's that and I wore it
during Fashion Week people loved it I
got lots of pictures taking matching in
this jacket but yeah how cute is there I
just love the vibrancy and if you're
wearing an all-black outfit and then you
throw in a jacket like this
amazing I bought this jumpsuit and it's
exactly what I thought it would be like
it's just beautiful
the fabric is lovely it fits like a
dream I love it and then I also bought
this shirt as well which I thought was
really pretty it's just the white
chiffon drapey shirt but it has this
nice detail on the neckline I kind of
like my new era shopping where what
ideas I buy one
two bits from different stores versus
lots of bits from one store so I went to
open Outfitters and I rarely ever go to
open up fitters if I'm honest with you I
just always bypass it but I went in and
I was really really happy and there were
some really nice things and firstly I
picked up this like vintage style denim
jacket it's kind of cropped and it's
just really loose really baggy but I
love it like I would love to wear like a
black and katsu and they wear this over
it or something not cats it but I can
put these suits it's a bad thing it was
55 pounds and that's the exact same
price is denim jackets on ASOS and right
in Topshop so that's that so some of you
guys may know that I get my JustFab
which is my monthly subscription service
they might either receive a shoe or bag
this month for September I received a
pair of shoes these are the ones that I
picked then the Celia and they're really
different but you're going to find that
why I kind of have this obsession with
like Victorian lace up type stuff and
they are painting which you didn't
realize but I think they're quite nice
and hopefully I'll work out how to spell
these at some point in time but yeah
I'll put links in the description box as
well
so I also went to H and M and I haven't
been teaching them for a long while but
I picked up this tassel bag I've really
wanted to tassel bag and when I saw this
I had to like to scoop it as soon as
it's actually really big like you can
fit everything you need on a night out
in that and even for a day trip home and
then finally I've got this trench coat
from there as well which you know this
is not going to do justice to it it's
amazing on it's just beautiful the thick
and it looks great like just as a dress
you could wear like nothing underneath
and then and I went to Topshop and I
bought this amazingly cute hat like I
love this hat how cute is this hat and I
just picked it up because I I actually
ended up seeing Joan Smalls
it when I was in New York and she
brought this gorgeous little leather hat
I thought was really cute but I tried to
get another half and my head just looked
too fat for it and it was just
embarrassing but they found these
and have these balls which I really felt
like balanced out the fat head nurse but
they're really cute and again I wore
this during Fashion Week and it was very
very popular people love the height it's
really cute I don't know what it is you
guys know I'm obsessed with like leather
things and I have two leather skirts two
pairs of leather trousers but I don't
have a fitted leather skirt so I picked
up this from oh my love which is sold in
Topshop and it's got the nice quilt dete
up the side and the quick-cook detail
here and it looks a bit shiny but it's
not shiny it's like nice and matte I
think it might just be the light and I
went to Aldo to get myself a rucksack I
really wanted a rucksack
after traveling with one back bro but
realizing how evaluable a nice rucksack
is because you can literally just put
everything and anything in your rucksack
and just take it around with you and
this one's got quite a lot of gold hold
row and I'm probably gonna like paint it
with something but I really liked it and
I like the fact that the compartments
here it's got a little zip there and
details I wouldn't put anything precious
in there but sweets and food and stuff
so I also went to and other stories
which is kind of like a baby sister of
cause and I love it in there and the
star so chic and pristine and it's
partially affordable it's definitely
more affordable than cos but then I
picked up these shoes which like me
holding they will not do justice to how
amazing they are when they're on and
I've got lots of blog posts with me
wearing them because they've been my
most favorite shoes and I've probably
worn them almost every day since getting
them which means it's a very good buy
and they kind of have that the detail
like that it's close you get a bit of
foot there but a foot there but a foot
there you don't get any toe cleavage but
you're getting lots of extra foot in
cute places but then I also bought this
really cute cuff from there as well
which i think is just adorable and looks
great guys I don't know what's been
wrong with me I've been buying quite a
few pairs of shoes but I picked up these
lace-up shoes probably about a month ago
from Zara and I love them I've been
looking for something just like these
and when I saw them in Zara I literally
sweep them up and this tire detail looks
really nice on the foot again I've got
quite a few blog posts wearing me so if
you and have a check do you want to
check that out you can see that in my
description box and then just a couple
of other bits I went to River Island and
I bought this t-shirt which isn't really
me but I've been trying out some new
stuff and it's got enough pink in there
for me to be happy and I just love the
Cheetahs kind of sitting there so it
looked very regal and I think we've let
our this would look beautiful like this
and that leather skirt harcore and then
from misguided I didn't have much this
time for misguided but I did pick up
this kimono and it's this floral kimono
which is absolutely beautiful I hope I
can get another day couple of days wears
out of it before it gets too cold but
it's like nice it's floral and it's got
the tassel detail at the bottom because
it was Fashion Week I bought you know
one or two pieces that maybe a little
bit more pricey than what I would
usually buy but I bought went to Accra
by aqua which is not good AQA AQA q and
I bought this top which is inside-out
but I bought this top and it's amazing
because it's got this gorgeous mesh
detail at the back can you see that mesh
detail the back it's just beautiful and
I wanted some pieces that kind of stood
out and were a little bit different and
the top also has these matching trousers
which are peg leg trousers that fit
beautifully it looks so glamorous I love
it and it's nice in your wardrobe to
have a couple of bits that you know a
stand-up bits that you can last forever
and mix-and-match so when I was in New
York I went to Sephora and to be honest
I was only there for four days and it
was intense so I wasn't able to buy and
lots and lots of stuff which is kind of
a good thing but I did buy a few bits
that I didn't think I could get here so
firstly I bought a bareMinerals lipstick
and this is from the marvelous Moxie
collection and I picked up a color
called breakaway you guys know that I'm
really into
it really into my Mo's and my pinks I'm
actually wearing it now and again it's
really beautiful and it's really
moisturizing I love it and I kind of
have a similar color to learn it's but
that's it there and I really like it
it's almost like a nude emo nudie mode
movie pink it works really good on dark
skin like myself I couldn't help myself
I picked up some of these Marc Jacobs
polishes I believe they're from the new
collection and to be honest I was sold
by the packaging that's why I mean you
picked it up and I bought this color
here which is good Jezebel and this
color here which is called me and it's
kind of an iridescent pink and then
that's that close nice rich red and I
saw that they have this little section
of like five pounds at the $5 thing and
I picked up this pore cleanser and it's
you can't see but it's like got all
these little ridges and everything on it
and I can imagine it like totally
getting into the pores and cleaning it
and you guys know that my raspberries
pause so and I'm gonna try this out it
was only five dollars I also bought a
pencil from Make Up For Ever I've
actually got a Make Up For Ever
foundation which I've not used before
but I went with when I went out with
lily and Ana they're the most convincing
bunch of girls you've ever met you
better check out their Channel
literally pick this up I was like this
is a beautiful beautiful champagne and
she swatched it and I was like I'm so
dict it up it's a really nice own
champagne color which I was using on the
inside of my eyes and it looks beautiful
and then I also bought a Sephora own
brand black and eyeliner and it's a
scroll up one and I hate pencil wants to
hate sharpening stuff so it's really
nice and it's got a really nice little
smudge stick on the very end which if
you want to smoke out then you probably
could another product I bought after
being convinced by both of the girls and
was the quarterly it's the beauty elixir
and supposedly this is a Holy Grail item
so it's great to use prior to makeup and
just when you want to kind of refresh
your skin and your face so I picked that
up then finally I
to NAS and I picked up like an ice berry
blush if I can open it that's what that
looks like and the color is called
seduction I was looking for a quite a
dark purple blush that I could kind of
wear almost like contour as well so guys
that's the end of this whole thank you
for watching hopefully you made it to
the very end make sure you guys check
out my blog where you get to see a lot
more on the items and the products that
I use on like in picture form and I
