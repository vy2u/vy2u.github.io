another massive haul and the good thing
is that I only do hauls monthly now so
you get to see everything Matt bought
along the month and as I always say get
a cup of tea get relaxed so you can
enjoy this whole video also have you
noticed I've got different hair and one
thing I've realized is that I'm really
self-conscious about changing my hair
it's always been a problem for me like I
I've never liked the shape of my face
because I always felt like I look like a
Teletubby or as people keep saying a
Bratz dolls huh I've already consciously
my hair like back like this but you know
let me know your thoughts and I got um
my haircut so this is just extensions on
the end but if you want to I'll show you
like my new bob I need to go back to the
hairdresser's because it's looking a bit
limp right now so anyway I'm just gonna
get started and show you what I've got
in today's haul the first thing is more
like a celebratory thing as well because
I've now become one of the style
panelists for JustFab co uk and
justfab's like massive in the states and
they've just come over to the UK and
they asked me to be one of their
panelists which is amazing which means
that I basically get to pick you know
one item per month that I really like
from their showroom collection and I can
get to have a view on it and put
something on the website there which is
really really cool
so for the month of October I actually
ended up picking some heiny boots and
I've been looking for a pair of highly
boots for a long time so they had a
great pair there that I just had to pick
and it's these here and they look a bit
shiny because I've got a light like
shining on them but they're really not
they're really nice and they are very
very high and they've got the buck holes
at the top as well now the one thing I
will say is that if you're like me I've
got pipe skinny legs but then I've got
quite big feet as well so I find that
there's always I always have a problem
with sizing when it comes to um high
knee boots but basically these are a bit
big for me at the top but I can make
these work and how much it cost to be
honest but you can definitely check them
out on the JustFab code at UK sign up
they're basically like a monthly you
pick monthly
accessories that you want from there but
you can find everything out on the
website and potentially out I'll do a
lot more talking about that later on so
the next item I bought this month is
from Miss Selfridges and it's basically
this chiffon dress and I was gonna wear
it I went to the Delilah concert and I
was gonna wear it but I just found it a
bit too much basically but I don't know
if you can tell but the front is like a
flock like a old lady flock but a really
gorgeous
old lady flock and it's really pretty
and I think the camera is picking up
really well actually
and then it's like see-through in the
middle bit here but it's not like like
not like cheap and slutty it's like
really elegant and then the bottom half
is basically a maxi skirt with a mini
skirt underneath and it's kind of
see-through and I do love this dress
because it looks so gorgeous on my only
issue is that the bottom bit on the
inside does keep rising so you know as
that mini mini skirt rises up Lucy
Bennett
you know jingling underneath there so I
do have to wear either tights with it or
an extra skirt underneath I went to my
beloved hmm I don't know if you can see
I just turned off my side light and I
just um wanted to show you what the
shirt look like shirt looks like it's
got these amazing little beads all along
the collar there oh I hope you can see
this but it is gorgeous and it's like a
nice see-through white shirt that I love
white shirts
I live in white shirts and also this top
is where I bought this this month and
this is from actually a market in market
near Chancery lame I think it's coming
up towards Camden could be Camden Market
actually I'm not entirely sure and
there's like this lady who sells some
bits and bobs but sometimes on my lunch
break I walk around and I just found
these really gorgeous tops you would
have seen them in might get ready with
me video as well and I just what how
cute is this even though it was from a
market it was 25 pounds and I think in
that's not market price but I do love
the top and it's so soft and my sister's
gonna in the dark gray and my god
in the night grey like this so yeah so
I've become a massive fan of online
shopping and you've seen me using a few
other online brands and love clothing
has become one of my favorites and I get
loads of things from there basically and
luckily I have a special process with
them which means I get some nice good is
extra but I thought I still have to show
you the goodies I've got that I love so
this jacket you guys have been seeing me
wear all the time this is now my like
statement regular everyday leather
jacket and this is from love clothing
and it's like cinched in and its really
nice than the Pels are just gorgeous
it's a really feminine leather jacket
and it kind of folds up like that
actually this is only I think it's only
50 quid I thought a nice leather jacket
with studs and detailing 50 quid is an
absolute bargain I will link it below
but that is that leather jacket you see
me wearing probably all months and all
the time basically and I think I got a
bit excited with leathers and studs and
stuff like that because I also I also
ended up buying a waistcoat from them as
well because I don't know I just thought
it was really cute and if you got like
wooly a woolly jumper underneath you'll
be fine this is gorgeous - turn off the
light again but I also bought this what
is it it's like a linen a linen um top
and it's like a nice square box top but
it's really really elegant looking and
it's got lace just along the bottom here
as well if you can see that and it's
really really nice and really really
soft so I love that so the next thing I
got was this t-shirt which I love that
was really off key wasn't it this
t-shirt which is absolutely gorgeous
I love the gray I love the black I love
monochrome so and the sleeves are kind
of see-through as well don't know if you
can tell that there but yeah they're
like a see-through fabric and this grey
bit in the middle it's just so gorgeous
it's quite weird everything I bought
from there was either black or leather
so I also got this leather dress which i
think is going to be absolutely gorgeous
for the party season come
up and it's never and then it's got a
panel in the middle that's like fabric
basically and it's like all pleated down
the middle this dress is gorgeous what
do you guys think about me doing or how
I wear leather video I think I might do
that cuz I've got a lot of leather
clothing now I'm like obsessed with it
has anyone else got another addiction is
it just me and Blackie's well I don't
know why I keep getting so much flack
but I picked up this other dress
so you'll notice basically I've got a
trend for things that are fairly high
and round neck and black so this dress
here which will look gorgeous with the
belt on it's got some shoulder pads on
it as well and it's kind of got a gold
panner in the middle which is actually
like an added bit of fabric it's quite
plain but it's a kind of thing I'd wear
to like dinner or something casual some
black tights or some boots
finally from love clothing I picked up
this top here which thank God isn't
black how cute is that it's actually a
very modal um it's from the Vera Moda
brand but I picked up enough clothing
calm and that's really elegant I might
just wear this in my next video tell it
cute
a little bit so on - just a few polishes
because I rarely buy polishes but I've
bought a lot this month so I went to the
you know everyone's been talking about
the Essie brand and I saw their
collection in Boots and I just picked up
these two so the color I've got is dive
bar and smoking hot and this is like a
really gorgeous iridescent color here
you probably can't see but it's kind of
got blue green purple all inside it
gorgeous and this is a kind of milky
purple which is what I'm wearing now on
my nails which you might not be able to
see I've also been obsessed with glitter
so if I do my nails I add glitter on top
like on just two fingers or three
fingers on this hand and I went to
Claire's accessories which I never go
into but I was obsessed with getting a
glitter nail polish and that was only
two pounds and it's like the silver
glitter which you might be able to see
on these
and then I also went to Topshop and
picked up their polishes as well which
are expensive they're six pounds a
Polish polish but I picked up this color
here which is called his and hidden
treasures and it's again another kind of
iridescent polish like this but this is
just fabulous it looks like a bluey
Goldy greeny purple flaming just
gorgeous but when I put it on it looks
more of a green basically it looks more
like a shiny green which is quite weird
but it's really really nice
so also went to Zara being one of my
favorite stores and you guys have
luckily and I've probably seen some of
these videos and have been up some of
these items in my previous videos it
might be asking where they're from
but I picked off this gorgeous bag from
Zara it was fifty quid and it's just
gorgeous
this is suede I can off greeny mustardy
green and this is leather here and it's
just like a lovely triangle bag
and I also bought some leather trousers
from Zara as well and these are the
quilted leather trousers I want to show
you the quilts can you see the quilts oh
you can see it there and I must say that
if you do buy these number one be
cautious because I've had two pairs and
both split these are okay right now but
be cautious and also I needed to get
size 12 and I'm actually a size 8 so you
really need to go up a few sizes they
were quite quite tight then I also
bought this gorgeous necklace I am
celebrating by the way because I we've
got the keys to our house basically so
it was a celebrating time when I
celebrate I spend money and this is what
I bought on the deck I found that I got
the keys to the house I've got the keys
to my house yeah this is always gonna
have a memories to me so I got this
necklace in celebration and also in
celebration I went ahead and bought
myself a new Michael Kors watch now
sadly enough I lost my old Michael Kors
watch in Spain
basically when I was in Spain I had
and I didn't have it any longer and I'm
not sad about Louise in the watch but
the lot had so many memories for me
because that was my time in New York and
I remember when I went down to it was it
Soho I went down to Soho and went to the
course store and this was before it was
massive and I just remember you know
have so many memories to me and I was
sad to lose it but which has even better
memories now because I bought this in
the day that I got the keys to the house
okay so here's the watch clips up which
I love oh yes I'm gonna show you some
details of it but what I like about it
is that the face is completely different
it's Roman numerals versus numbers and
also the watches are silver watch but
it's got this row in the middle which is
actually rose gold on two other sides
and gold gold in the middle and around
the faces like some action that looks a
bit like down one taste but is it down
Mondays because I hate down one taste
basically and I just love the way it
looks oh I love the fact that these are
like a lot slimmer then my old ones it
was very expensive this is like it was
229 pounds so yeah it is an expensive
one but again I think watches are worth
it
sorry guys is this video really long I
apologize so also bought myself another
leather skirt so I've got one that I've
had for years from from H&amp;amp;M and I went
to Oasis and I bought myself a new
leather skirt which has got really slim
pleats really really slim piece but this
is so sexy this guy come on it's just
gorgeous and that was 45 pounds so it is
quite expensive but I do feel like it
was really really unique
so my next items are all from Primark
and I rarely go into primer so when I do
go in I do enjoy myself and I do get
some nice bits first of all I picked up
a woolly bobble hat and I've been loving
woody Boyd ball hats recently and the
thing is is that the weather is mad cold
it's just mad cold so you literally need
a little bobble hat to like I don't know
mess up my hair so I'm not gonna put
this on but it's gorgeous if you've got
like long hand wavy hair just
lovely lovely then I also ended up
buying for fur waistcoat which is what I
wanted in the first place but I found
the furniture when I was like I've got
the trim I don't need the waistcoat
but I do need the waistcoat so I got the
waistcoat in like a cream basically I do
feel like a pimp slightly but it's okay
enjoy yourself one time so that was 20
pounds and it was great over a leather
jacket I also bought these designed
trousers and I bought a pair like this
last month from Topshop I ended up
taking them back so they were anywhere
them too well I wasn't gonna wear them
so but I picked up these instead and
these are like 10 pounds less than that
and they look just the same they're
gorgeous they probably don't look so
good at camera but they are absolutely
gorgeous the only thing is that they're
made so badly like the bottom of it
flares out like this like oh you silly
these are meant to be cigarette pants
but that's fine for the price I can't
complain and I can easily say them in
myself so that's what I'm gonna do some
of you might be thinking Patricia it is
winter time it is but I bought a pair of
maroon shorts because I really want to
be wearing a lot more shorts but I wear
them with tights and boots so I'm not
too concerned and they had these and
then I write the fact that I had the
belt to come with it as well so these
are gorgeous and they're kind of Taylor
and there you can see the crease at the
front and everything so loving these
shorts so I also got this really large
chunky woolly jumper which is like
off-the-shoulder gorgeous warm just cozy
I love this jumper perfect for winter
and it's in like a grey blue it's got
bits of blue wool going through it and
they had loads of colors littles a tease
but yeah this was really nice and it
feels so snug and just gorgeous I also
bought a knitted skirt as well I don't
know if you can see that it's a knit
pattern but it is a knitted skirt which
is great for winter because I feel like
I don't have enough things for my bottom
half so yeah I got this skirt as well
and finally I bought this white shirt
again I love Y
shirts but the wonderful thing about
this white shirt is that it has an
amazing leather collar will never affect
collar with all these whole details in
it as well so it looks like a floral
pattern and it's just gorgeous so I love
this oh and the bottom of it it's got
black on it as well
hey guys that is the end of my whole
apologies I know it was quite long I
hope you didn't mind too much
but I'll see you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
