Department grandpa don't say I'm lacking
in the trouser Department that sounds
like you're lacking in the trouser
Department hey guys guys welcome to my
channel today I wanted to do a whole
video it's a his-and-hers haul video
because Michaels bought new clothes so
Jessica you know it's a good start he
bought new clothes airer mystic violence
and I don't know if any of you guys
would agree but Michael basically shops
at once a year yep and the clothes in
his closet he's had for like six eight
and I went through the closet and I was
like no Michael you need to get rid of
these and is that know they've got
sentimental weight enough of you talking
about you talking yeah personally I feel
like my style is actually improving
significantly changing I will hold my
hand up and accept the fact that growing
up and probably until about several
weeks my style and my clothing choice
and my fashion sense was pretty is more
pretty pretty much about as good as my
dad's so to to the ladies you know not
every guy you know is a good dresser
Michael was not no but tell the truth I
have improved significantly right but
you know this is just a little advice
ladies don't just look at a guy who
knows how to dress then you can you can
work on him you know we've been working
on Michael but you can't for years you
got Ricky you can't go online and buy a
personality yeah it's true yeah but you
can look oh that's a tweetable every
nervous about doing it just show what
you've got I would love to hear what you
say about your items that you've bought
okay
I'll just I'll just do it spontaneously
but maybe what made you pick them up but
let's get going because just by the way
little thing to mention all the things
that I've got here I picked people love
come out this air did Patricia dress
here did she pick that for you but no I
picked everything and I do my own
shopping and I wear my own clothes
so you've had your little laugh
I'm serious okay my cousin how does
other let's say you have the online shop
way Michael saves a whole bunch of items
then I review there and I'm like no no
no no no and then I'm like Michael you
didn't pick any jumpers and then James
move if it's a whole bunch of jumpers
and then and then I was like yeah happy
for this to be the purchase there was a
t-shirt that had a point of contention
between us but we are I'm gonna go pray
but I let the t-shirt slide it's kind of
in here right we're wofully gone do we
need to start this whole video okay like
normal whole video as they always say
guys get a cup of tea a cup of tea a cup
of time a cup of tea there's a cup of
tea over there sweetheart
that's cold now first thing stairs I
want to show you some items from Zara
that I picked up number one I bought
this really big like really nice scarf
and I love the light texture on it let
me show you it kind of looks a bit
tribal um it's just a really nice like
chunky scarf and we're getting good for
layering right good good for layering
and no I just like the texture of it and
stuff and it's nice and black and white
but I feel like right now and it's
transitioning I could totally wear this
I bought this red bag I just thought it
was just a really nice color perfect for
fall and you know like this kind of
burnt red is like my favorite color in
lipstick and clothing and everything
kind of goes with your t-shirt as well
and I love the texture that it's made of
and I've been wanting to just refresh my
my high-street bag collection so I've
kind of been building a designer bad
connection but it meant that like all my
other stuff we're just not that good but
yeah this is this bag here you guys know
I'm a little bit obsessed and I had to
buy some leather trousers they look
really shiny on this but they're not
actually that shiny and solid do my best
leather trousers ever but they're quite
small so I had to pick up a medium so
next I just picked up this body con grey
skirt from Zara it was 15 pounds it's
like a really nice chippie skirt I love
skirts like this but it's not like made
of the jersey material that goes really
bubbly so I love just kind of wearing
stuff like this that laying it with
hoodies and all that kind of thing so
that is that my amazed
ding most amazing by that everyone needs
for fall is the over the knee boot I've
been looking for the perfect pair
because they're really hard to come by
the perfect pair and these are them in
my opinion so do you want to show your
stuff from a sauce then I love it look
at something it's weird right
ok so first up I bought this t-shirt
hold on this whole done this how you do
it yeah yeah it's perfect you hold it
like that yeah this is josue knit
first I got this t-shirt I love I love
wearing t-shirts in all honesty this is
the t-shirt or contention by the way
guys I think why are you buying a
t-shirt and for what you know like it
but I'm not going to be stood outside in
the rain all day so anyway I like a good
t-shirt nice fitted t-shirt it's got a
nice tight round neck I was doing like
these droopy ones that give off a lot of
chest nice little pattern on there and
yeah you'll see what it looks like when
I do a bit of modeling with it on my
dear next up I bought this kind of
checkered shirt now when I saw it I
wasn't too sure in fact they always make
everything look good on the models right
but then when I looked it a bit close up
I thought it's a little bit Grandaddy
maybe could look like a bit of a
middle-aged middle-aged man shirt but it
actually fits really nicely and remember
I wore it and you have a quick look at
of the day yeah you even you said you
guys initially out the pack we like all
so yeah so I'm got a fitting clothes
check pattern and I think it's good look
yeah okay
you agree yeah I picked that I've got
actually quite a few denim type shirts
but this one the reason why I wanted to
get this is that if you check the
neckline I don't know what they bought
the name is for this kind of like I have
no idea round neck round neck it's like
a shirt it's got button-down but then
it's just got up around it kind of look
a bit oriental or Asian to me maybe I'm
making it up anyway I've got a few shirt
with this style on and I think I got
your favorite kind of yeah but that's
because it's kind of like it looks smart
enough to be not like a just a casual
scruffy t-shirt but it's not over the
top like a shirt with a collar on like
you're going to a business meeting or
something like that's actually quite a
skilled you know talking about things
and it's quite if you're not used
doing it feels a bit it's actually
harder than you'd think
it's not we're a bit weird maybe but
it's harder than you think to do it
naturally next some items from monkey
it's this oversized kind of jacket shirt
number one like this kind of color is
like my favorite color but and this is
just a really nice kind of outerwear
piece and I think it's great for fall
because it's not too thick and I can lay
your jacket over this as well and then I
bought this hat from monkey I look good
in hats though you could wear it for the
rest of the day like it yeah yeah good
in hats
yeah how about like that not sure about
that but you look good in hats
okay so I also bought a wooly hat for
monkey as well because I'm really
excited about wearing hats because I
often have bad hair days so yeah so I
also wanted to show these these hills
from Zara and I'm basically obsessed of
boots number one with an open bath
because they are so so so so comfortable
and you guys know me my foot issues size
7 UK size know so seven and half eight
okay sizing what you're talking about
thanks baby pea likes wifey I don't know
why but I love showing the back foot
right the dot as long as it isn't drying
Chris because no dry and crusty back
foot isn't it isn't we've had many dry
and crispy not mine not my baby I don't
have a darn Chrissy back foot but yeah
these are absolutely gorgeous this bit
here is like your net so it's so so so
comfortable so next I have a few bits
from Topshop and it's this gorgeous
jacket which is in this lovely lovely
olive and it's kind of like an oversize
you know the Duster style
coat and I just love the color you
didn't like this color you like yet it
just looked Doughty that's a jacket that
it looks so nice on don't post on that
one as well just a practicode a UK go
check that out
look look so next is this blue shirt
sorry Michael it's right over your face
yourself on Cassini probably for the
best and this blue shark here and I just
love the color and it kind of reminds me
like a school shirt but it comes a
strong color would totally be worn like
the next would totally be worn really
smart I love the thought of like
layering it with like a dark navy jumper
on top of it I just think it would look
really really cool I love the buttons on
it as well one of the things that I
noticed was that I was
heavily lacking in the trouser
Department only grip pad don't say I'm
lucky in the trouser Department that
sounds like you're lacking in the
trouser Department I didn't know how
that sounds he's not what I meant what I
did not have
well thank you well I'm n okay why man
dude this is going to xr8 it am i
blushing have I said what I meant to say
was I did not have as many pairs of
trousers as I needed to have
but I wasn't lacking in a chastity pop
but no I am got these pairs a couple of
pairs of slim fit chinos from Uniqlo now
what I think is sick about these in fact
of all the purses that one of the things
we've often had argument is that for me
the wife wants me to wear skinny jeans
she likes skinny cut and everything like
which is fine but personally I can't
wear them and guys if there's any guys
watching or girls if you've got thickish
legs or thickish calf muscles or a bit
of a bit of a bum because I've got a bit
of a bum as well then you can't wear
skinny so it's so uncomfortable it's
like really constricted you get a lot of
bulging clot as well get the most part
very well but that's not for like
excited or anything that's just bestest
this is nauseous just relax bulging you
don't it's not what you need skinny fit
just wasn't wasn't working for me and
it's very tight and constricting in the
in other regions so you get slim fit and
these Uniqlo ones are what's so good
about them is they're kind of stretchy
so when you le roi elastic you know i
always do this thing when is it oh we
have to show you we're gonna show you
time Michael tries all my favorite
sauces in the shot he does this like
lengthy lunging and Roger
sucks because I was like you are you
turn the blazer you go what you never
good at doing that anyway these Uniqlo
about two pairs I've got this pair which
I like am what you call the dang stone
beige attack color and I righted a red
jumper oh yes we'll show them with a red
jumper stay tuned you'll see them with
our jumper guys and we also got a this
but earth pet which basically the same
thing slim fit
but just a dark navy blue look a bit
black on there but actually navy blue
same thing slim fit but without the
crotch crotch grabbing finally I've got
blue pair from a sauce which are not
quite the same in that style but not
stretchy but it's a little bit darker so
you're not really seeing everything in
the exact color but yeah you get the
idea you get the idea okay so that's
though childís I bought this dress misc
I did it was 1407 we did the blog Pope
did a blog on this Wow magazine we did a
blog post of life on this one but you
break the code at UK go check that out
oh yeah absolutely photos she did the
modeling excellent damn idea thank you
babe okay so this dress here it was 7
pounds 99 from Miss guided and the thing
about it is that I love polo necks and I
love polar neck dresses Zara has a
really nice one at the moment a G with
sleeves and I just loved the way this
fit and everything and I saw it $7.99
and you it would be amazing it fits like
a glove and you can't really go wrong
and you know it's ok quality it's just
that kind of Jersey material and then I
bought this dress which is is really
really cute you've not seen this but you
do need to go kind of like braless
without this little black dress it is
from misguided and it's just over the
knee with like a a really nice neckline
and a criss cross back so I know that
during Fashion Week
I'll totally wear these to like a party
or something because it's getting colder
now and it's these are my fault these
are my favorite I love all young person
things so I got this is charcoal gray
and it's got cable a cable knit pattern
on it which is so cute cable knit
pattern so that's that and I also went
and got this one which is I love this
one I love this one actually wooly you
can't go wrong with a good thick woolly
jumper in a gray birthday presents
Christmas presents just anything
presents for a guy and a good thick
woolly jumper is going to be a surefire
win I love the color on this like this
color is amazing it's great for you as
well kind of exact
how much it cost but I think if you
could buy it you're going to keep it for
years but I wanted to show this shirt
from River Island I wore it in a few
videos back and loads of people you know
ARC's me about where it's from and stuff
and they really liked it it's quite a
pricey shirt this was 38 pound i which i
think is really pricey for a shirt but
it's a really good-quality silky shirt
and it's got a really nice kind of
pattern on it as well like feel it isn't
it babe tomorrow I bought this hat I
have been wearing this hat night and day
my phone is just belén so I bought this
hat and it looks just like this and I
just love the way it looks
what do you think this is also River
Island it's got a little bit of a gold
detail on there wit but it isn't too bad
at all I really like that finally I also
shoulda bought quite a few bits on a
zooss and I bought these basic t-shirts
which are not made of the jersey
material at one and the white one and
really really good quality I needed like
a basic black tee and a basic white tee
in the box shape so I picked up two
these strappy heels and I love the fact
that the heel is chunky but it's also
got like this kind of print pattern on
the on the heel they are super
comfortable nowadays like comfort is so
essential to me I haven't got time to
waste you know struggling in high heels
so I always go for a chunky heel like
that and then I bought this handbag
there this little clutch here and I love
the kind of art deco stitching pattern
it has there as well again I said I was
trying to update my my handbag
collection finally I bought this shirt
is well that kind of has this pocket
here it's a really light loose flowy
chiffon Isha I have so many of these
like these are like my favorite kind of
shirts I don't know why I always buy
them but marker they last they last
forever and they just look really nice
on my final piece from a source is this
oversized bag I have been looking for
like a perfect bag like a new big bag to
just carry around every day and this is
it I kind of got bored of wearing like
bags then I found them to be very heavy
but I love wearing a bag like just over
my shoulder especially if it's like this
kind of bucket shape as well so guys
