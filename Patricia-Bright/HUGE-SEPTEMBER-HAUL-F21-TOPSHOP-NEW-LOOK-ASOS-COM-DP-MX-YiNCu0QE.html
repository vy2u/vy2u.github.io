video is going to be a haul video and
it's like a major hort wolf depend on
what you call major but I've got loads
and loads of bits and bobs so I'll just
get started so the first thing I've got
is this thoughts which is basically
going to use as a storage box like
brushes and bits of makeup and bits of
jewelry and I picked this up at TK Maxx
for 65 pounds ninety-nine and basically
because I'm going to be moving out
really sit well who knows see about six
months from now and when I get married
and like anything I'm picking up has got
to be really classic and really it's got
to go with the kind of idea that I have
for my new home so i'll probably do like
a video for how to decorate in New Hope
where we have one by God's grace we'll
see what happens but and yeah so this is
a really cheap box it's made of solid
wood TK Maxx is an amazing store for
picking up and bits and bobs and they
actually went in there to pick up one of
those stands where you can hang your
jewelry but I ended up finding loads of
stuff like this they've got so much
amazing storage for really good prices
it's like quite not designer but kind of
like designer but discounted so I
couldn't find one of these things there
but I actually found one at forever 21
and when I saw it I was like oh my gosh
I need this I've been needing one of
these for ages my joy is I all clumped
together and I said no I just have this
anymore so I got one of these and this
was 12 99 from forever 21 ended up in
forever to anyone with Nia and like we
literally were picking up all the same
pieces like if we had enough time we
would have just stayed the netter ages
and bought the host not the whole storm
that we don't like for them to anyone
that much but and they had a few bits
and bobs actually over actually like you
know we were expected we have respect
from forever 21 because we're not the
greatest fans I'm definitely not the
greatest fan I went out to New York and
i right what is this forever 21 but
anyway I picked up this necklace which I
really liked near they pick up this one
but everything else who basically got
the same and it's like a brush the metal
and to me it reminds me of something
Egyptian like it looks like one of those
boats and I don't know I just loved the
way it looked dirty met all perfectly me
and it's weird but I really liked the
of on the end there and that was seven
pounds 40 picked up these groaning you
know I'm getting into granting t-shirts
I love then the loose billion mmm so
this is like a gray a light gray and
it's got like black dotting and white
dotting it's just really soft really
Lewis and and it's quite warm so for
wind if I've got looking at your jacket
over it should be fine so I picked up
this piece of sparkle mm-hmm Sparkle
Sparkle and this skirt and you also pick
this up and it was literally like I
don't know we saw it as like yes I must
have but it's like one of those weird
things you don't really know how to wear
it but I really like it i think if you
look like a casual loose black jumper
over it just to dress it down this is
just really really chic so i also went
to mac and i'm like i'm going to do a
video when it button I'm into like dark
lipsticks now obviously it's autumn or
fall as you guys over in the state's
caught it and I picked up basically two
lipsticks so the first one I picked up
his rebel I've heard a bit about Red
Bull someone else mentioned it and
that's what I've got on right now but
I've mixed this with papaya punch and so
it's not so dark papaya punches from
sleek and it's just this lovely lovely
dark berry color which i think is
suitable for all complexions you know
even if you're dark you can kind of get
away with it and I'm going to show a
video and how to get away with dark
colors like this I also picked up night
moth which is a lip liner which in calls
me and a lip liner which you know you
put on with that to get really really
dark plumbing a fit because that's
actually quite nice for a dark lipstick
and they also picked up this color which
is called Prince nor and this is really
dark really rich I think on me it looks
almost like I've got black lips the
console and maybe returning that one
because I don't think it's really suited
for my skin and the night morph lip
liner does exactly what this does so
from Star Sofia calm which I've been
saying wrong all the time I was sent a
few items and I kind of looked at them
and worked out what I liked I'm still
going to include them my whole because
they're fabulous and you guys must see
them so
it's the safe route sure you guys have
seen me pick up this and do a video on
it and it's like a really nice bat wing
shape really nice bat wings see thru
black lovely lovely must have you always
have to have something see-through and a
shirt like this and this was a decent
price from what I remember and I my
favorite which you guys have also seen
an outfit a day these ombre shorts come
on I've literally been wearing them
everything sounds really dirty but I've
been wearing them every single day like
come on and they're high-waisted is well
and they were a little small for me I
must say so i would get these are like
quite petite sizes but i'd say get a
bigger size but yeah with tights and
like see the tightly looks so elegant
and everything so ended up also what's
it called new look I'm limited some
randoms doors new look bought this
mushroom shirt look at it mushroom
mustard chef lovely lovely lovely shut
it looks so expensive but I'm the type
of person I really like fabric to look
lush and expensive this looks really
expensive like when you see it the way
it feels everything the way sick it's um
what's the what do they could I think
it's called like hidden button so all
the budget buttons are hidden down there
and we wear that all the way up to the
top with it with a chunky chain this
this is my by for the month or this is
my body definitely forgot to show you a
few other bits i got from stars of sofia
which is this handbag as well which is
kind of in my car what you call it
snakeskin and leather fabric I don't
think its role ever but it's very very
nice very very high quality they're very
sturdy and it's got this really cool
detailing on the button so it's really
very much a statement piece and also I
got this they call it like a bucket bag
as well from there and I've actually
lost the strings shame shame on me but
yeah but this is nice I still carry it
like this because it's got a button as
well and it's also got this really cool
detailing and it looks really cool just
off one shoulder so ended up in Topshop
didn't buy any clothing but ended up
buying multiple nail polishes so I've
got this blue one which is called indigo
red wine mushroom that as the herd
everyone has which I love this instant
gold one which is called foil which is
what I've got on now although it's a bit
chippy you don't need to look at that
too closely and then this green which my
sister got actually so this I'm not back
in who wears who wears this anywho
picture clothes and then another store
that i really go into is Dorothy Perkins
but I went into there and I found this
amazingly beautiful olive and quilted
jacket you know there's barbour jackets
and everything I'm not going to pay 150
pounds right it make I've got this for
40 quid and it's really nice it's a
lovely quilted jacket I'm gonna do a
video on how to wear coat your jacket
cuz they're not that feminine and I'm
quite a feminine girl and I'll show you
how I can make this cloud my only a
little bit more sex there yes that was
40 quid and then this chain this chain
is from Dorothy Perkins look at that
that looks like it's made by a designer
now obviously it doesn't feel very
expensive but it looks very expensive
it's really nice finally I was at a Zhou
Scott I went online to asus com they've
actually got a big sale on I think it
might have ended now I'm really sorry
I'm a little late but I picked up this
bag this really cool like red shiny bag
it's a mini bag I've got all these mini
bags all of a sudden but I love it it's
really elegant it's really pretty you
know with when you're wearing all black
this would you like pop and it goes on
my lipstick as well this is really great
for autumn and i decided to pick up i
don't know why i'm probably take these
but i decided to pick up some of those
like in a good kind of not freakum
dresses but club dresses you know ty
short but I poly hit them back then
because it's not really me but this is
gone my facebook quite literally love
watching her Facebook and that's that
only I don't use facebook I just go
check out her profile see what she
looking like you've been good
um yeah I saw this dress and it's this
is backless dress from a zorse what's
not backless it's got like ribbing at
the but you can't see you know it's just
you have to see you on basically but
it's like that bondage at the back and
it's in this bright orange and it's not
too short actually but it's quite short
and it's really fitted and that was like
20 pounds i just picked it up sit look
really nice on the model something a
little bit more elegant is this one
shouldered cut out dress so it's really
cute like that and then the sides of cut
out so you have a bit of flesh on there
and it's in a petite section so the only
issues that it came up really short in
the size eight so I'm going to have to
exchange it and get in a size 10 well
that's that and then finally I picked up
a red blazer and it was 70 pounds it's
gone down to 37 pounds so i think it's
worth getting really lovely it's got
black lapels as well kind of like my
white one and that's it really Oh feel
like I've spoken for ever and yes that
is my whole so I hoped you enjoyed it
