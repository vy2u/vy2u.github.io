video is going to be a haul video and
it's like a major Hawk wolf it depend on
what you call major but I've got loads
and loads of bits and bobs so I'll just
get started so the first thing I've got
is this thoughts which I have based
basically gonna use as a storage box
like brushes and bits of makeup and bits
of jewelry and I picked this up at TK
Maxx for six five pounds ninety-nine and
basically because I'm gonna be moving
out really sit well you know see about
six months from now and when I get
married and like anything I'm picking up
has got to be really classic and really
has got to go with the kind of idea that
I have for my new home so I probably do
like a video for the how to decorate a
new home well we have one by God's grace
will see happens but and yeah so this is
a really cheap box it's made of solid
wood TK Maxx is an amazing store for
picking up bits and bobs and they
actually went in there to pick up one of
those stands where you can hang your
jewelry but I ended up finding loads of
stuff like this they've got so much
amazing storage for really good prices
it's like quite not designer but kind of
like designer but discounted so I
couldn't find one of these things there
but I actually found one at forever 21
and when I saw it I was like oh my gosh
I need this I've been needing one of
these for ages my joy is that all
clumped together and I said no I just
have this anymore so I got one of these
and this was $12.99 from forever 21
ended up in forever 21 with Nia and like
we literally were picking up all the
same pieces like if we had enough time
we would have just stayed in there for
ages and bought the hosts not the whole
storm that we doesn't matter to anyone
that much but and they had a few bits
and bobs actually over actually like you
know we were respected we have respect
from forever21 because we're not the
greatest fans I'm definitely not the
greatest fans I went out to New York and
I write what is this forever 21 but
anyway I picked up this necklace which I
really liked
near they pick up this one but
everything else you basically got the
same and it's like a brush the metal and
to me it reminds me of stuff in Egyptian
like it looks like one of those boats
and I don't know I just loved the way it
looked dirty met all perfectly me and
it's weird but I really liked the
on the end there and that was 7 pounds
40 picked up these groaning you know I'm
getting into groaning t-shirts I love
then the loose billion mmm so this is
like a gray a light gray and it's got
like black dotting and white dotting
it's just really soft really loose and
and it's quite warm so for wind if I put
like a little jacket over it it should
be fine so I picked up this piece of
sparkle
mmm-hmm sparkles well crawl and this
skirt and Niall also pick this up and it
was literally like I don't know we saw
it and I was like yes I must have but
it's like one of those weird things you
don't really know how to wear me but I
really like him I think if you put like
a casual loose black jumper over it just
to dress it down this is just really
really chic so I also went to Mac and
I'm like I'm gonna do a video when the
eye button I'm into like darkness up
sticks now obviously it's autumn or fall
as you guys over in the states courtly
and I picked up basically two lipsticks
so the first one I picked up his rebel
I've heard a bit about Red Bull someone
else mentioned it and that's what I've
got on right now but I've mixed this
with papaya punch so it's not so dark
papaya punch is from sleek and it's just
this lovely lovely dark berry color
which i think is suitable for all
complexions you know even if you're dark
you can kind of get away with it and I'm
going to show a video and how to get
away with dark colors like this I also
picked up night moth which is a lip
liner which of course they're a lip
liner which you know you put on with
that to get a really really dark premier
fit because that's actually quite nice
for a dark lipstick and they also picked
up this color which is called Prince na
and this is really dark really rich I
think I mean it looks almost like I've
got black lipstick on so and maybe
returning that one because I don't think
it's really suited for my skin and the
knight morph lip liner does exactly what
this does so from star Sofia calm which
I've been saying wrong all the time I
was sent a few items and I kind of
to them and worked out what I like so
I'm still gonna include them Mahal
because they're fabulous and you guys
must see them so it's the sea fruit sure
you guys have seen me pick up this and
do a video on it and it's like a really
nice batwing shape really nice batwing
see-through black lovely lovely
must-have you always have to have
something see-through and a shirt like
this and this was a decent price from
what I remember and are my favorite
which you guys have also seen an outfit
of day these ombre shorts come on I've
literally been wearing them everything
sounds really dirty but I've been
wearing them every single day like come
on
and they're high-waisted is well and
they were a little small for me I must
say so I would get these are like quite
petite sizes but I'd say get a bigger
size but yeah with tights and like see
the tights it looks so elegant and
everything so ended up also what's it
called new look I'm limited some random
stores new look bought this mushroom
shirt look at it
mushroom mustard chef lovely lovely
lovely sure it looks so expensive but
I'm the type of person I really like
fabric to look lush and expensive this
looks really expensive like when you see
it the way it feels everything the way
it's it's it's um what do they could I
think it's called like kiddin buttons so
all the body buttons are hidden on there
and we wear that all the way up to the
top with it with a chunky chain this
this is my buy for the month a this is
my body
definitely forgot to show you a few
other bits I got from stars of Sofia
which is this handbag as well which is
kind of in my curve what you call it
snakeskin um leather fabric I don't
think it's real leather but it's very
very nice very very high quality though
very sturdy and it's got this really
cool detailing on the bottom so it's
really very much a statement piece and
also I got this like a bucket bag as
well from there and I've actually lost
the strings shame shame on me but yeah
but this is nice I still carry it like
this because it's got a button as well
and it's also got this really cool
detailing on
it looks really cool just off one
shoulder so ended up in Topshop didn't
buy any clothing but ended up buying
multiple nail polishes so I've got this
blue one which is called indigo Redwine
mushroom that as the herd everyone has
which I love this instant gold one which
is called foil which is what I've got on
now although it's a bit chippy you don't
need to look at that too closely and
then this green which my sister got
actually so this I'm not back in who
wears who wears this anywho and then
another store that I really go into is
Dorothy parkings but I went into there
and I found this amazingly beautiful
olive and quilted jacket you know
there's Barbour jackets and everything
I'm not gonna pay a hundred fifty pounds
right it makes a lot lists for forty
quid and it's really nice it's a lovely
quarter jacket I'm gonna do a video on
how to wear cruelty jackets because
they're not that feminine and I'm quite
a feminine girl and I'll show you how I
can make this company a little bit more
sexy
yes that was 40 quid and then this chain
this chain is from Dorothy Perkins look
at that that looks like it's made by a
designer now obviously it doesn't feel
very expensive but it looks very
expensive
it's really nice finally I was at a saw
Scott I went online to Asus comm they've
actually got a big sale on I think it
might have ended now I'm really sorry
I'm a little late but I picked up this
bag this really cool like red shiny bag
it's a mini bag I've got all these mini
bags all of a sudden but I love it it's
really elegant it's really pretty you
know with when you're wearing all black
this will just like pop and it goes on
my lipstick as well this is really good
for autumn and I decided to pick up I
don't know why I'm probably on take
these but I decided to pick up some of
those like you know they'd kind of not
freakin dresses but club dresses you
know tie short but I didn't and poly hit
them back then because it's not really
me but this is gone my and Facebook
quite literally love watching her
Facebook and that's that only I don't
use Facebook I just go check out her
see what she little I see some good ads
um yeah I saw this dress and it's this
this backless dress from ASOS
what's not backless it's got like
ribbing at the back you can't see you
know it's just you have to see it on
basically but it's like that bondage at
the back and it's in this bright orange
and it's not too short actually but it's
quite short and it's really fitted and
that was like 20 pounds I just picked it
up as it looked really nice on the model
sounds like a little bit more elegant is
this one shouldered cut out dress so
it's really cute like that and then the
sides are cut out so you have a bit of
flesh on there and it's in the petite
section so the only issue is that it
came up really short in the size 8 so
I'm gonna have to exchange it and get in
the size 10 well that's that
and then finally I picked up a red
blazer and it was 70 pounds it's gone
down to 37 pounds so I think it's worth
getting really lovely it's got black
lapels as well kind of like my white one
and that's it really
oh I feel like I've spoken for ever and
yes that is my haul so I hoped you
enjoyed it bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
