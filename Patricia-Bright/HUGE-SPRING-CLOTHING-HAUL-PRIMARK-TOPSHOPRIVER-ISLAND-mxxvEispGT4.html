today
I must apologize I have a really stiff
neck I don't know why it's so stiff so
I'm like I can't move my head this way
so I look fine look if I look awkward or
anything and so sorry but like I've got
loads and loads of stuff and I haven't
done a haul in a while but the sun is
shining and the weather is getting a lot
warmer and I've been very excited about
shopping hahahaha
that's my new awkward love but yeah mike
is actually making cups of tea so I'm
gonna wait for my cup of tea before I
actually do the whole because I need to
quench my thirst now this is a whole get
your cups of tea and your popcorn or
your cupcakes work you like let's get
started
so guys let's first and foremost get
started with Primark think about program
right when you go in there you only go
you in there like just to get basics or
something no no no no no you don't leave
with basics move everything first thing
I bought was this miniskirt now funnily
enough I have the jumper version of this
like fabric of this skirt but it was
really nice I really like it I've not
tried it on yet I never try on stuff in
store fingers crossed it fits but I know
that I really really like this and it's
got this kind of panel section and I
might have to show it to you up close
but it's got some really nice kind of
textured patterns on it and I love white
and just blues and stuff like that so I
can wear it with loads of things I also
bought these basic vests because they've
got really nice basic vests
they've got seam free ones they've got
loads of them in lots of different
colors so here's a black one it's just a
simple vest that I might wear under
something and then I've also got the
white one as well they're probably about
how much are they if three pounds so you
can literally buy two three four of
these and you'll be fine they also have
the t-shirts and they used to have this
really nice round neck one that I've had
for years they don't send it anymore but
I like to stock up on these for the
summer so fresh right vests so to add a
bit of color
I'm getting very excited for the
Christmas season the Christmas season
the summer seat of my neck it's funny I
couldn't even give altitude properly
okay the summer season and I just really
liked the colors on this and it's making
it like some kind of silky material so
it's a little bit shiny and I like the
shape of the neck and this is what the
back looks like and it's got two straps
so that's going to look really sexy on
the back you know girls oh I also bought
another basic vest but this is me I
don't know what fabric this is made out
of but it's like made of a really nice
nice kind of soft but not cheap e fabric
and that wasn't terrible explanation
guys I'm really sorry but what I like is
that it's racerback and it's got really
no side pop side side sections for your
arms see holes that's what they call the
thing but yeah I do think it's gonna be
really nice really salty with a pair of
jeans or some shorts over the summer but
especially feel about broiler so I have
a little bikini underneath girl it's
gonna be looking good so next the whole
varsity trend is massive and like
sometimes I don't mind buying into
trends if I just don't spend a lot of
money on it and if I like it so I found
this varsity kind of styled T now what I
liked about it is that it doesn't have
any of the numbers on it and I don't
like the numbers because I think it's
just too obvious but in terms of the
color code and the stripes and the shape
I think that's actually really really
nice it's got buttons down the middle
it's five pounds and again with like
shorts they look really really cool I've
realized something about my style I
realized that my style is that I don't
like to look like I've tried too hard
and I'd rather look like I've not tried
versus like I've tried too hard and now
were they
and it's just more basic and really more
simple and really not that fitted
anymore ain't nobody got time to see
must dumber grows but I know it's summer
right I know it's getting works getting
to summer but I did write a jump up
because it was so cute and there are
days where it's still really chilly and
I always cry it feels like a little bit
oversized this is a size 12 and I just
like the color of it and it's gonna be
cute slouchy skinny jeans with this
gorgeous perfect and it was eight pounds
pocket any better than nothing really so
I have bought a denim dress from prymaat
before and it would it's a very very
very good denim dress I wear all the
time and they have more and this I had
to find a size 12 again because they
just didn't have any more sizes but it's
like a what they call it's like a little
shift dress hold on stuck it's this
really cute little shift denim dress I
just really like the back of it as well
and it just seems like really nice and
chilled out denim jacket or something on
top of it or a leather jacket good to go
so I've seen jumpers like this in
Topshop for like 30 pounds this was in
Primark for John Rolfe 14 pound tuck
eyes a really nice little jumper and it
has this really nice bit of jewelry
attached to it and the great thing if
you don't like the jewelry on it
can take it off right it's on a piece of
perspect and I love the tail color and
stuff that's on it but it's just really
girly and pink i'm actually wear this in
my next video or something I think
that's a really cute jumper
I don't wear button-down shirts a lot
because I think that they make me look
really frumpy but I saw this one and
it's like this see-through chiffon polka
dot one and I thought you know what
that's kind of cute rock it with some
leather leggings or leather jeans and it
will make it look a bit cooler but I
thought this was quite pretty so I
bought that as well this was ten pounds
one thing you can't fault prymaat for is
their shoe collection especially if you
want comfortable shoes or trendy shoes
that you don't want to spend a lot of
money money on and I bought a pair of
these kind of like they're not like flat
forms but they're kind of like flat
forms ish and but they're just a bit
lower now the key thing is that these
were eight pounds now in all the other
shops if 240 pounds but they're here
I've got them in the white and I bought
them in the black and the key thing is
that these are really really comfortable
and they look just as good as the ones
in the other stores and they're not I
don't think that next year I'm gonna
think all these are really cool or nice
to wear but I think now I will do it
especially for the summer season so four
eight powers you really can't go wrong I
bought a pair of shoes that were six
pounds like I've been wearing from
Primark the last time I would been
wearing them all the time so comfort is
great if you go to Primark for shoes so
next up that's actually becoming one of
my favorites it's River Island and I
think over the past year or two they've
just got better and better and better
and they're so good you know that when
you go in there you're going to get
something really nice like every time so
I've been wanting a
Kings suit so a blazer with shorts a
sort of girl wearing it she looked
fabulous and I was like I need me one of
those I never found the dream one until
I went to an island and it's plain you
guys might love my plays not big like
pilots patterns but it's these shorts
here which kind of like high-waisted I
bought them in a size a thing come out
with me there's a little bit sore looks
they seem a little bit wider on the
waist but we'll see what I like is the
shape they kind of have that kind of
loose you snappy shape if that makes any
sense guys I'm sorry but the shape is
going to be really really flattering it
won't be like right on your bum but it
will just caress your bum a little bit
and then I also bought the blazer as
well so the plan is like a little black
vest or something and just wear them
together it was really really cute and I
think the color is just so so nice for
spring and summer and they all support
these pair of shoes now these kind of
shoes are you're either gonna love them
or you're either going to hate and and I
am in love and I've seen them with a
couple of bloggers and thought hmm
they're a little bit whatever
Soloman store tried them on and what I
loved about them was how comfortable
they are how cute they are and how high
they are you really can't go wrong and
like I have boobs and all those other
shoes and the honest truth is that when
you wear them they're like this really
really hurts and beauty is pain but I'm
gonna get me some chunky heels again
that either love or hate let me know if
you hate them or if you love them leave
a comment below but you know what I
really really like them I'm probably
gonna wear them with the blue outfit
just because next place I went to shop
is office now office is one of my
favorite places for shoes
I bought pair of these I love what these
called again love kind of like loafers
yeah of Cordova loafers basically
they're Payton tassel loafers they look
great with a pair of mum jeans or skinny
jeans and again comfort is key to me
nowadays but if you can get comfortable
and cool at the same time these you
can't go wrong with so next is a
misguided so I bought this kind of it's
like a one-piece where you kind of put
it one on the bottom and what I really
liked was that it's kind of got an open
back like this now the issue is that I'm
moving this so it's a little be a bit
difficult to wear but you know what I've
over gonna rock it or I'll just wear a
bra were there and just wear something
on my back but I really like the color
and the dog tooth pattern that all
happens to pattern that's on there and
then I don't know what I was thinking
guys kind of got too excited I bought
this and I saw a go on Instagram wearing
it calm her name Instagram so amazing
and I was just like no I'm gonna pick
this up now that's what it looks like on
me
what do you think guys what do you think
this might be a returner I'm not sure
but then they didn't just play some
Caribbean steelpans next me you get you
get one saying I like it it's kind of
cute it's two for holiday anyway now you
guys know I love this top I've worn it
in my last video and it is this black
mesh top a lot of you asking me where
it's from it is from misguided perfect
this is just me it's black it's really
simple but I love it with like a black
bra some people thought it was a little
bit too exposing but you know if you
don't want to wear it like value come
with a vest underneath come out with a
bright color top underneath there's so
much you can do like a mesh black top so
I love this next there's another colored
patent top as well and it's quite an
vibrant color again I saw on the site
and it looks amazing on the model what I
like is the shape of it number one but
number two the back of it's like they're
so cute it just opens up just like that
and it's really flattering especially if
you have a little bit of a pooch pooch
approach them about it kind of sits over
it but since clings on it
and finally as we are all going into the
whole kind of ripped denim phase bought
some nice ripped denim jeans from there
as well these are like a really nice
stone wash color and I just love how
much ripping and messiness there is on
it they're very no flattering in size
and very very comfortable
I don't usually buy jeans from misguided
but I definitely would know how because
they're really really nice so next up
guys is Topshop I really really like on
top drop meet it recently first thing is
this little crop top that I love this is
a top that I'd pour I got it so much for
wearing it now and it's great for small
boobies it's great for big boobies
because it kind of just hangs so it
might hang loose if you've got big
boobies and in my hand
hi if you've got little boobies it's
made of silk so it was expensive this
was 40 pounds but I think it's the kind
of thing that will stay in your closet
forever and you could wear as dress down
or dressed up another I also bought this
shirt which says kiss me it's funny
because um lynnie Melrose I'll link her
channel below she said that she wore
this and she was getting a lot of
attention from guys so I was like I'll
be careful walking down the street and
like this is I'll say that's that and I
just love this color grey and I've got
their t-shirts like this and they lost
so so long they're very good quality and
then this was inspired by another
YouTube I'm Michelle I'll link her
channel below she did a haul video and
she bought these little cropped basic
tops from Topshop they're eight pounds
apiece and it looked so nice I was like
you know what I'm gonna go buy them I
think she only bought the black one girl
I bought the black the blue and the way
overcooked but you know what these are
really really good they're eight pounds
right and you could wear them every day
like with every outfit casual dressed up
I love them and they're so comfortable
so this is the gray the gray sighs so so
cute I love it that's the grey that's
the black that's the blue and that's the
white you guys have to go and get
yourself these trust me another item
which is either you love or you hate and
it's the mom jeans if you guys saw my
last video enough them and they're kind
of in a black but it's kind of like a
dirty black so it's kind of like a bit
washed out I love that look and it makes
them look a little bit older but we're
trying to create you know relay with the
90s all right so guys that's those so
next is this like silky low fitting top
I love it it's only night it was about
20 pounds and I love the bottom of it in
the fabric place
to see them it's very very nice it's
very very comfortable again it will suit
goals if you have a bit of a pouch and
just wanna hide things or if you want to
just look for really really comfortable
in the item of clothing that you're
wearing this is one of those items where
it's not clinging into anything your
feel so comfortable this guy here is
from yeah this guy here it's like a
pleat skirt the colors a bit baby poop
color but I kind of like that with like
a white top or laptop kind of might say
it's like baby sick green yeah but it's
cute I love the fit I feel like a woman
when I wear this finally it's my
favorite jeans my favorite Jean has I
bought in a really long time I don't
know how to clap I'm so blush
it's these skinny jeans with the Jamie
jeez
but I think they're a little bit higher
waisted than the normal Jamie jeans
because I do come up nice and high and
then they have their slit at the knee
and it's a perfect lip but it's kind of
like quite reserved and they have slit
good pair of jeans these so guys my
final stop was Zara sounds been good to
me this over the past few months flat
they do not return things if they're
over the date they won't let you even
exchange so heads up guys I don't know
when that new policy came into place but
I was not best pleased first thing I
want to show you are these shoes you I
know I mentioned that some shoes are not
comfortable when you've got a skinny
heel these are an exception these are
very very very very comfortable it's so
gorgeous and so sexy
these shoes are amazing where have you
been all my life
I'm glad I heavy now you man you babies
I've got this dress right this is such a
beach dress it's like long and it's got
like buttons all down the middle and
it's just such as sexy print like I love
love love it I just need to be on a
beach somewhere in the South of France
actually wearing this how gorgeous is
next is this you can't really see that's
not good doing it justice but it's my
maxi jacket which I love it's from Zara
it's quite expensive this was 70 pounds
but I really do like this jacket I've
been wearing it all the time like I
might wear like a skinny black jeans and
like a little tight black top throw this
over a hat fabulous like this jacket
just makes you look and feel fabulous
and my sister went in and actually
bought some stuff for me because I got
an amazing sister and she's like my new
stylist anyway she's like my inspiration
so she bought me at least and she buys
things that I wouldn't normally buy but
she bought these kind of like cropped
loose trousers they when she bought them
I said there tried them on but yeah yeah
so yeah they're kind of like loose baggy
they've got a bit of red in it I'm not a
big red wearer but I thought they were
cute and they're kind of cropped as well
so with heels they look really nice but
um Thank You Maury for picking those for
me kind of developed a thing for like
white baggy trousers but these are
another pair that I bought I love them
they kind of look like jobless but
joggers with like swag if that makes any
sense and then like a light gray
beautiful beautiful fabric again the
kind can't do it justice but really nice
they're loose they're slightly cropped
again as well and I don't know what I
was thinking goes I don't know but
sometimes Patricia's a bit crazy I found
me some white leather jeans and I
thought I might be able to made them
look good so we'll see but here are
these white or cream
I say cream leather jeans which I just
thought it's really really unique I've
not really ever seen like cream leather
ever ah so why not try it see what they
fit like and they look going to be nice
on so I see how I style it and finally I
bought this little top which I thought I
really liked the top of it it's nicely
and it's really girly really really
girly but sometimes you've got bigger
look a little bit like a bridesmaid
yes so guys that was a huge huge huge
haul and let me say that I don't shop
like this all the time I'm not done a
whole video in like two months right and
as I said I just kind of pop into the
shots once in a while and then I end up
you know accumulating lots of stuff that
I really really like and I hope that
when I show you this stuff it basically
gives you some ideas of what is in the
stores what I like what I don't like and
at least let me be the lab rat who tries
the stuff on and if it looks awful then
you guys know right you don't need to
waste your money on it and I'm also
gonna say make sure you check out my
blog is Patricia bright code of UK where
I basically style all the clothes that I
have so guys thank you so much for
watching and give this a thumbs up if
you guys like holes and I'm gonna have a
beauty home as well because I've got
loads of beauty stuff but I'll show you
guys that in another video so guys thank
you for watching and I'll see you later
