have something that's a little bit
special
it's a TK Maxx haul and I've watched
those of these before but I've never
actually done one and I thought yes I'm
gonna share why I bought that I ended up
buying a lot I'm kind of trying to
spring clean redecorating having the
kitchen down and all that kind of jazz
and I know that usually in TK Maxx you
can get some really really good like
homewear bits so that's what I went in
there for and then I ended up buying a
whole bunch of other things as well so I
thought let me do this video let me show
you what I've got and hopefully some of
you guys may want to go in there because
you can really find some great pieces
like one-off pieces and like when
they're gone they're basically gone so
if you want something that's a little
bit different you can definitely go now
and get some stuff so first things first
I hope you guys can see this you
probably won't be able to see this but I
found this my I went to makeup holder or
a jewelry holder but I saw it was 14
pounds I thought it was a really really
good prize and basically it's like this
is gone and then it opens up it's like
it there we go it's got a little lacquer
on it and it's got all these little
compartments and I thought to myself
this would either be great for either
jewelry bit or makeup bit in one of my
drawers because it's I love having
compartments and places where I can keep
things and it's got this really cute
design around the outside so look at
this amazingly cute stag head really
keep stag head I think some of you guys
are thinking why on earth are you gonna
do with a stag head but this is a great
jewelry holder I could put my necklaces
on it I could put rings on it could put
bracelets on it and it's just a great
way to like present my jewelry and it
just really looks nice and it was again
nine pounds 99 so I bought this clock
here I loved it I thought it really
really stood out in the shop just cause
it's kind of like retro and it's got
really large numbers I
wanted something that was quite cool
stanza I've got a big theme I like white
silver and gold and basically quite calm
and chilled out so this goes perfectly
well hopefully will go perfectly in my
room and what I like about it is like a
proper alarm clock yeah
I've been playing with that quite a bit
but I'm trying to not have my mobile
phone mic in the night and I'm trying to
turn it off and usually I use my mobile
to wake up in the morning but why not go
with the traditional couple like this
randomly I found that they also had
these velvet hangers I love these sin
velvet hangers I can't get enough of
them two winners sometimes they do break
so I do um stock up on these but I've
never tried the one from TK Maxx so I'm
gonna try these they were $5.99 and
there's like one two three six there's
ten in the pack I get so easily
distracted I found a couple of other
things like these aren't really home
stuff but I found like this notebook and
I like you know right you know it's and
stuff like that and I thought it was
really really pretty and they have loads
of really pretty notebooks I would have
just stopped up just because they look
so nice but I always write notes all the
time and it was $2.99 I think it's
relatively reasonable and they had loads
of different ones right so this is just
the one that I picked up I'm also a
candle lover and they had a huge huge
huge collection of candles and I was
like okay why not pick some of them up
so I just went around for ages like
smelling them all smelling them all
which ones do I love I found this one
here it's a pair one one I like the fact
that it was quite green if that's a
really weird reason to like a candle I
liked the color but it smells divine
I can't wait to like stop burning these
they smell really really really good and
then I bought this one as well it's milk
bar from a deep honey and almond cream
it actually smells like really creamy
vanilla and I love this I'll probably
put this in the bathroom
to be honest wes is in my room so I love
this I love
I found this huge bag like properly huge
huge huge bag it's so beautiful isn't it
it's got this kind of snakeskin print
it's just really really nice and I'm
looking for like a big carry-all bag
especially for when I'm traveling
because sometimes you're going to the
beach and then you've got to carry all
the stuff and then you've got some hand
luggage this is basically going to be my
hand luggage bag could put my laptop in
it towels in it makeup in it blah blah
everything in this bag the next I ended
up finding this this jumper here it's a
cream jumper you guys know I love my
creams and my whites but it has all this
little I let detail in it and I thought
this is really nice for spring double
just wear it with a pair of jeans and
it's just really warm and cozy looking
and then this way I love the color on
there sometimes I'm a bit colorful for
some strange reason but when I saw this
I was like no this color would really
look nice with me like oranges and
yellows they're nice colors and it's
such a simple design it's like a long
line jumper the sleeves are really long
and then we call and again while it's
like this season I'll try to wear as
much jumpers that are colorful ever I
can next I found these jeans they're
quite a few of these jeans and I found
them and I like I love the jeans they're
like a really nice dirty stone washed
denim and they've got this really nice
knee detail some of you guys might know
I have a little thing for knee detail on
jeans but if you wear really simple
crazy things sometimes it's really nice
to just add something with a bit of
drama on it and I think that the knee
details got some drama on it and like
the wash and the pockets of really nice
at the back and they fit really really
well so as I said I'm kind of in a
holiday mood and I found this dress here
it is a really nice patterned shift
dress it's quite bright quite bright but
you know on the beach and will look
quite good a little bit
underneath it and probably wear it as a
top as well it's a really nice dress and
it's got a really nice pattern on it so
you guys know about my little fitness
journey so it's 10 pounds in 3 months
I'll be totally honest in here I think
I've actually gained weight but I'm not
getting the right in muscle
I hope because it's muscle but to assist
me with my journey I bought some gym
kick because at least if you feel good
you will eat you know you'll be more
motivated you know you look good in that
gym bag yeah you're gonna lose a lot
more weight I'm sure and they had so
much active we're really really nice
active where they were lot of designed
that active where I saw there as well
but I picked up this really nice gray
set of active wear this was a nice
little sports bra a sports bra top and
the good thing is that it's got like a
little bit of padding in it so if you
get a bit chilly you know you're
protected and then I bought the matching
bottoms and it's got this really nice
pink detail on the bottom it goes really
well with the top obviously they're from
the same set so guys that is my little
teacake max haul I hoped you enjoyed
it's really not good in there there's
like lots of bits that you wouldn't
necessarily fine um elsewhere and when
you're in there you end up buying so
many different bits that you wouldn't
have necessarily thought about doing so
yeah definitely go in there and have a
little peek so guys I will see you in my
next video thank you so much for
watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
