know so much it's quite nice and I
believe actually my first holiday was
was until I was about 11 or 12 and that
was to Italy which you guys know I I
used to always go there a lot and I
think we spent six weeks out there
intensely playing in the Sun and
actually I didn't get burnt to a crisp

places and bled profusely okay the first

ever cooked for me I remember being so
excited that was at four years ago maybe
five years ago actually and I was at
Michael's cooking and it was good and
you were sweating in a way in that
kitchen you didn't know that it kind of
a packet oh did it it didn't come out of
a packet first time living alone I did
it feel about when you moved out of the
house fun loved it was a bit weird
because I I had to fill up the fridge in
myself and wash my own clothes in there
tidy about all that time your mom did
that for you
I was a mummy's boy big time mommy's boy
I mean I pretty much just took to it
like a duck - yeah concrete yeah first
girlfriend yeah I do actually
funny story so this girl I was at school
with I won't mention a name but I think
she'd like me for a while and I wasn't
really sure what to do because I was
like really nervous or shy and then
eventually we decided that yeah I kind
of said yeah we'll be we'll be boyfriend
and girlfriend and the very next day and
she dumped me
why it's not working out but it was like
my first girlfriend lasted for one day
our first time going on holiday together
oh that was amazing
was our honeymoon that was our honeymoon
- can you imagine that I was quite um
quite worried about how it would go
there was two week long okay so we were
together for two weeks
consistently I've never spent two weeks
with anybody and I just thought flipping
her this is a bit baptism of fire in it
yeah that's what I kind of fell actually
but it was so good it was good first
time ever owning a pet have you had a
pet never had a pet
never had a pair cap never had a golfer
never had any forms of pet I heard
gerbil called Eric after named after
Eric Cantona but he died what's that
funny how did he die died of natural
causes
Oh days straight of old age how old is
it he died very peacefully in his sleep
actually was he like hard and stiff stop
it
he was a good friend I said love that
gel I would hold him and let him run
around my room I'd Hoover up his poop
and he dropped them on the floor that's
why I don't do pets he was such a cute
little pet he never bit me if he knitted
me a couple of times but that gerbil was
very very very dear to me was he hard
and stiff when he died I didn't did you
pick him up with his tail no I didn't
and then I stopped that don't make jokes
over it you know seriously don't make
jokes over that Gible was like precious

did actually cry when he died ha ha ha
