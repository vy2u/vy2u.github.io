at dinner coming up hex but hex fat and
doing makeup I've done this before
wow you seem really confident this time
I'm doing a makeup before okay great
excellent okay let's do this
so Michael join you get your blindfold
on yeah these are from one of our many
trips so more than likely you and I
wanted to start off with a foundation
this is actually have you told bold now
the lights have gone out I feel like
just innately Center - I found a is
like a long chibi thing it's that brand
to move like pace but comes out isn't it
yeah yeah oh that's it yeah foundation
Evo is not a 45 it's good we're gonna
cook classical yes and don't you know 40
MW 45 so you're gonna need a brush to
apply that foundation with no come on no
no no not that much
okay so I'm not not that brush this is
weird
oh no no lower lower
Omar there you go okay go give it a
shake you don't need to shake it yeah
baby mix it up okay tell me how much to
put down I don't wanna waste it all we
just want to put it pom-pom I think I
think I put it on there Conan got the
paste on I hand the pace yeah but on
there that's not your head your forehead
this is weird
where's the eye where's the end of the
tip that I bet enough on my brush is it
rubbing off
do I need to pump it more you want a
contour right rather cheap right I'm
gonna get the contouring right oh yeah
especially in my eyes I know I'm not the
new
keep holding the chin yet with the mouth
I can spray your mouth with it it's
actually quite a good fun though in the
working it's kind of bonding all right
well that tastes so bad Kelly should
have got a contour this cheap here to
exam kind of a nice smooth stroke you
just want to give it some volume and
some make sure you get some volume and
depth in there when you're just
seasoning it all in there yeah okay
shaken if it gets dangerous don't stop
just stop
oh you're using very good strokes
Michael you've watched this before
haven't you
ah there's some really good tutorials
out there guys if you want to watch them
I'm gonna hold the eye down to protect
it ah I love the pressure that uses well
when you're really good you can get some
oh and also backwards and forwards that
go again for great little board oh yeah
I think put a little bit of a light
change around it always that not I do
like to conceal gee what to consider
making a concealer would be heat when I
do the job properly you get the
concealer in there so this is so that's
an angle brush oh yeah the one that goes
like that then it hooks off yes they're
looking off brush you see the concealer
he's concealing right around the eyebrow
where is it I don't know where either
there is it dies out of the right
careful not to take my eyeball out by
and then you want to come on to your
lashes oh I like I shadow I wanted to
look pretty today
Oh shadow so I've got a shadow palette
he's actually applying on though mm-hmm
oh I love it
you know me you see this kind of red
spots on your eyelids undergo pressure
that's a bit like blood on the inside
yeah yeah yeah please it's rubbing yeah
yeah I'm seeing those right now
perfect dreamy and beautiful thank you
and power what's hurting my back working
on like down so now we need to put a
little bit of mascara or probably is
eyeliner then mascara yeah and then what
you want to get is your little twist
oh yeah the twist I like the twist I
like the choice I think that's quite
cool what they call it is it actually
it's actually finger you got to get the
end or flick like that yeah there now
you connect it to the flick yeah isn't
it yeah yeah expensive mmm yeah about 20
quid 20 quid flippin pencil how did they
sleep at night seriously looking robbery
know where I'm going with this
hey there this is serious trust from you
I'm quite impressed that you're actually
here honey because you know I've not got
the most gentle at hand

I'm in the top row the top row of what
they my eyes are not a theater or a
cinema you getting the flip they're
excellent
ah is it is it on never sitting is it
even a pride on no is on it's definitely

has potential to do damage as well so
