of watch hello there beautiful people
welcome back to my channel lovely young
chappy with us today we also have a
guest from the galaxy you see there it
is of a planet on my forehead we're just
gonna pretend that Pluto isn't my face
actually that big thing rent it's paying
a boat right now in my head so we're
just gonna pretend like that isn't here
but today we are going to try some old
and new favorite beauty products and I
wanted Michael to kind of work out what
he thinks the prices of those products
are he is then a beauty aficionado I
don't think you've ever been around when
I actually do my full face of makeup and
so I wanted to use products and you
guess the price what a few your videos
entirely I'm a major fanboy okay well
I've never bought makeup so I don't know
I've got a rough idea what maybe high
end or low end roughly but so I want him
to guess the prices and I'm gonna put
all my makeup on I'm gonna be using all
products from one of my favorite
websites which is cult beauty basically
it's the website where I get all my
favorite new makeup baby is one of my
favorite sites honestly they have my old
favourites of my new favorites they've
got cult brands like anyone who's
looking for certain brands that you
can't find elsewhere or installs cult
Beauty usually has it they've got who
the beauty anastasia beverly hills
they've got so many amazing brands
they've got it all right and they are
celebrating their 10th birthday they've
been around for 10 magnificent years so
with every order they are giving you
guys one of these magazines and they
don't normally produce this your girl
has a little bit of a feature inside of
here and they are also giving away these
stickers along with every order and
they're really fun and carnival themed
as well for my followers you can also
use my code which i have in the
description
below when you spend fifty pounds you're
gonna be able to get a 10 pound gift
card within your order so this is a nice
little 10 pound gift for when you spend
some money
thanks to their birthday so yes let's
get into this video okay this is my
first product this is the hourglass of
Vail what have a feel we need to do a
touch in full text what do you think
that is valued at you don't primers fall
that's what you put on prime stuff in
that like when you're um varnishing
would okay it feels quite expensive I
don't know it's just something about it
feels quite pricey how long would this
last 400 that's a great question this
would probably last me about a month if
I used it every single day I think that
could last me a month to two months I'm
gonna just stop in the dark fiber five
pounds five British pounds okay so
sometimes I didn't know this had SPF in
it so I can instantly tell because
sometimes I will get a bit of a blue hue
so what do you think this is costing now
that we've added sun protection
alright the price up all right seven
pounds an amazing brand with a lot of
science and research
I love algaas this is really much II
this is really really mad I'm sure it's
value for money but like I said it's
gonna last two months one one month to
two months
yeah but exactly that's not the only
people 500 pounds of month you even see
that what it's literally blasted over by
everything that is giving me protection
alright so I was nearly there I said
seven pounds price was 55 yeah
so that prime is a little bit mad I'm
going to go in with the nyx honey Jimmy
up Primark this is actually in you as
well what do you know that I used to
think if you think if it was small then
it would be cheap but it's not the size
that's important he said real gold
go away leaving yes honey cheer me up
it's a primer its lower end than the
last one I'm pretty sure ten pounds
swifty done okay far off then so we are
going to go in with my foundation this
is the serum foundation from the
ordinary this is an old favorite of mine
I tried it out used it really liked it I
use it him they're not all the time but
it's a goodie cult beauty always have
these whereas I know they can be
sometimes quite difficult to get a hold
of but they do have these I know
foundations expensive mm-hmm actually
ordinary I think I've seen this one it's
quite cheap I think it was famous for
being cheap wasn't it I'm gonna say this
one is 10 pounds the ordinary serum
foundation cost 5 times 17 Wow okay I
find that I have to mix two different
colors but I mean for five pound 70 I'm
not mad at that I'm going to go ahead
and apply that with Beauty Blender I'm
gonna say that about quit 1 pound these
are I don't think you understand the
power and the difference these make no
I'm sure is useful it's like it's like
saying a spoon is useful to eat your ice
cream whether you don't know alright so
i wet this it expands and then oh it's
got expanding properties it expands it
makes your foundation look absolutely
flawless
plus I have tried other sponges to be
honest my favorite sponge is the Beauty
Blender well I said a pound 14 isn't 14
apologies to be specific is actually 70
well I mean oh we don't admit of a mix
sometimes I like to mix it yeah yeah the
mix and blend do you ever think I look
different or better without my makeup on
I think you look older the other day
right Patricia so very often she doesn't
wear any makeup she's not filming videos
over going out and I looked at her face
without makeup on and I thought she'd
had like Botox because her skin look mad
smooth but you know cuz sometimes makeup
cracks doesn't it yeah it gets creasing
it so that's a cool story foundation is
on it's now time for concealer this is
one of my old favorite concealers from
Kevyn Aucoin
it gives you super model glow so I was
getting into the product really hard to
get ahold of but not if your uncle do
you think this is pricey yeah even
though it's like not much in there this
could you and ask me how long this will
last
this will last you a year yeah this will
last you literally a year it could last
you two years it's mad I'm so excited
this will last you a year this is one of
the greatest concealers of all time all
right I think you've had enough I'm
gonna say because I know this one I
think this one it's a bit pricey 50
pounds 50 pounds it is actually 38
pounds okay you know what I'm saying it
like it's a bargain but can I guess so
high I think it is a bargain it lasts
like you just need a touch like it's
super concentrated look at that
you see how bright my undereyes look
look at me it like lifts them up from
the shadows see that Kevyn Aucoin lifted
my see that how I look like has been
made okay so I kind of look like an egg
because I don't have any eyebrows on so
we're going to go ahead and put on my
eyebrow pencil so this is a goof proof
eyebrow pencil from a benefit cosmetics
my favorite eyebrow pencil along with
precisely my brow I combine the two for
my ultimate eyebrow look okay let me
just show you there's a spoolie on one
end
cool right that's a brush basically
ration and then also it's like angled on
this end
cool right and you twist it up so cool
I'm gonna say 12 pounds that's not a bad
price that's not even a bad yeah I feel
like you're starting to understand now
so the goof proof eyebrow pencil is 20
pounds you're kind of a way off yeah
actually
but I mean I feel like you're getting
better I thought you wanted to be like
it's 2 pounds you didn't have brows
exposing me so I fill in my brows do my
line on the top line on the bottom fill
them in and then they kind of look a bit
random so I like to use precisely my
brow to basically draw my individual
front lines
so next up we are gonna go in with an
eye shadow this is the hooter Beauty
rose gold palette remastered this is the
new one more up-to-date version of the
huda beauty palette I want to give any
hints away but this is what the front of
it looks like babes I think who the
beauty is kind of pricey mm-hmm
this is quite a flashy thing that I
think could be well me personally no
what would you pay for I think like
someone who's into makeup maybe this
palette is 56 pounds Wow 56 it's a
collector's item as well
okay I'm using the shade man-eater just
here just on my corner right there man
eita oh it doesn't give you any ideas I
feel like I might want to mix some
shades from zoeva again this is their
screen Queen palette this is a new
palette some nice little shimmers and I
feel like I'm gonna still shimmer from
here like this look how much do you
think the pallet is babes I think this
is cheaper than the last one it's nice
but I think it's cheaper because does it
feel a bit cheaper is all little bit to
be honest right I don't know salty tones
I'm actually a bit muted in all honesty
like they don't pop as much for my skin
but it's something I can wear if you
wanted a muted look then this would be
the palette for you how much you think
it goes all right I'm gonna say this is
about as less colors as well in there so
by rice it should be cheaper wait 25
pounds this is 18 pounds 18 mate that's
great that's what we like well that's a
 you can buy a bit more than a
bit I try babe I'll try just for you I'm
gonna use
shine your light now on my lid got
something going I'm right and I'm gonna
use this shake or transformative power
just to like make that outside a touch
deeper I don't really like that shade
that shade I don't know that's fine we
can just add some more from the huda
beauty palette I'm gonna go back in with
whiskey I was able to use cocoa - like
compensate I'm gonna add a little bit of
this bubbly in to my little eye shine
corner teared up see for me cause this
even though this palette cost 56 pounds
I can use every shade to create the look
I want to create and I'm here for it
decide this sign of a dead planet
so I'm feeling a little flat and
lifeless so we need some highlighter
this is an illuminating drop from iconic
London how much if you know is for some
reason it's gonna be expensive
all right 20 pounds 20 pounds now I'm
gonna take 20 pounds
this is 2099 do I look like I'm worth a
million dollars now wait wait to be put
on and yeah I'm just using my fingers
I'm gonna use a little bit of powder to
set this is actually new I don't know if
this is already available Colt beauty
yet so you have to check if not you can
get on the waiting list this is the
hourglass a very old translucent setting
powder so I've not tried this before but
oh I love it they're so gorgeous you
already know it's pricey all right I'm
gonna say hourglass last warm thing we
had when them was med pricey so this is
gonna be quite expensive - Wow
okay I probably threw away five quid
there can't be that much quid I don't
think it's bad it's weird do you like
all yourself then mattify yourself cream
yourself dry yourself shine yourself
more you put more shine back corner I
don't know why we do what we do any
logic to it yeah the logic is beauty my
lips feel like ash right now so I'm
going to add a little bit of a
brightening up oil this is from
incredible cosmetics this is like a
glazing oil you can all come on now flex
let's mix up so you can use this to
prime as well this is an incredible
cosmetic but you can also put on your
lips or on your face to add additional
glow
oh well oil then but Phil all right 10
pounds 10 pounds okay he hit that on
their heads this is 10 pounds exactly
I've not used this before excited so on
the outside just basically like a lip
balm but a liquid one it's not a bomb so
I can grow oil I'm gonna go ahead with
this Becca gloss this is the Glo gloss
how much you think this is this one I'm
gonna say is 15 pounds this is 22 times
yeah that codes more high-end and I
really like their products so guys that
is my finished look I don't actually
know the value of this face but I'm very
comfortable in all the items that I use
I feel like you got better with the
pricing having the general the general
rule of thumb was take my price which I
think I was being like wishful thinking
and double it not always because you got
the price of that rosemary foundation
wrong there's that Weaver palette was
cheaper than you fought and there's
other items like the incredible items
are a little bit more affordable to be
fair I think I pretty much nailed it you
did you did a good job that's my
finished face I'm so thank you for
