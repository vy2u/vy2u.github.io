I like it this one this one's a good one
all of it Oh otherwise I might like it
hello beautiful people welcome back to
my channel I hope you are doing well as
you guys know I'm currently in the u.s.
of a darling and I mean by popular
request and the fact that I was back
here in the US I thought it would be
nice for me to do another fashion /
video I know I know I know and I was
like no how are we gonna just you know
elevate this fashion / video this is
like my second maybe third fashion /
video I decided we should bring over a
little guest so we're gonna get a little
somebody in does he want to enter into
the building it's good we almost knocked
me out of your head
Michael's here hello and we have seen
these on the web they're like husband or
boyfriend rating the outfit so you know
what we're gonna leave that what's your
thoughts I think I'm in a good place to
rate your outfits why is it happened
since obviously my dry sense is so fire
okay in you're a fashion connoisseur is
it mmm we think back to the last time
you shop for me darling what the heck is
that
doot-doot stop babe and my outfit
obviously flames just smoking hot right
so I think we'll get into it guys so
this is nothing my bag of goods might
does see me sometimes when I'm buying my
goodies but hey here's the reality of my
bag of hoodies I feel the pressure tada
it was this looks really weird to be
like right my outfit listen I wear what
I want to wear you have to be firm
empowered right now
man hey you know what my order actually
took quite a while to come so I always
forget what I ordered
you could look at it you know and then
we'll put it on because this is my first
impressions as well okay this is a bit
of a number this is giving me like
trainer vibes okay why cause I mean yo
it's actually nice I think it's quite
nice as well it's actually quite nice
it's giving me a little bit of a snatch
no I like I think you look good it fits
really good it shows off your figure
your figure looks fine either way
yeah smoking fire your finger looks good
it looks nice nice what kind of you know
it's like stretchy thick legging right
yeah that's nice I like the colours on
it being like a onesie like this Oh was
he
it was a onesie what do you think it was
yeah didn't think anything do you know
it looks great it it always looks great
it looks good it'd be a pain in the ass
if you go to the toilet though oh yeah
that's really true you know don't you
notice my logic my logic if you go to
the toilet you can have to basically be
punter inside-out outfit off pan
everything down to the UM to the
underwear just to basically what I would
do is have a big we before I put this on
but I actually think it's alright it's
nice my question is where are you going
wearing this like this I really like I
like that
I'll get out wear it this is a knitted
dress oh okay it's an actual knit dress
oh it's kind of simple I think I have
another dress like this out of the same
material from them it's a long and it's
good the Bartons it's got buttons down
the side I think that could be quite my
son
let me let Michael have it thoughts
first
yeah okay I like it do you know what it
looks nice it looks a bit longer looks
like you couldn't you could only like to
take like tiny little steps like this
otherwise you're gonna stumble play it's
nice if you like I mean it in a slightly
oh sorry let's be professional over here
what do you make 8 out of 10 a 7 out of
10
let me tell you let me feel the fabric
it's nice yes good it's actually it's
not too thin it's actually quite nice I
think it would wash well or I'll give
this one 775 sees nothing amazing but
it's alright ok guys so I bought a top
and I've also bought some fashion over
jeans these are obviously really really
popular people always talk about the
jeans and I've always had trouble with
the sizing I've ordered maybe once
before and I always get the wrong size
um really these are a feat to get into
that I'm not gonna lie
alright maybe we could have a look I
love that color I love that mustard
color is the color for you let me tell
you that top is nice that top i'm gonna
rate that top straight off the back I'm
gonna give it an 8 / 9 it's a nice color
it's a good fit ribbed again everything
is ribbed right I'm obsessed I'm
obsessed I keep buying things that are
ripped and I don't don't purpose but I
just keep buying it
yeah it's nice color is just that
mustard color it's nice the jeans I
think they look nice they fit yeah a
little bit pretty snug that you don't
like a pair black type jeans to me
that's it nothing to say I'd say just 5
out of 10 because they do the job what
no they're not bad they're not amazing
they're just a pair of black skinny so
you can take me out to dinner in this
love thank you very kind of you
okay so I didn't have enough white pants
okay so I picked up these white pants
$32 I'm not gonna lie
they're quite thin I got a girl I love
to say but you know what would you know
we're gonna let Michael come in and see
what he's gonna say about this it looks
a bit wafer thin almost it looks like
okay almost made of tissue paper
yeah but I mean it's okay honestly these
are extremely thin yeah as in yeah Finn
and I look like the shape of the teeth
down Mitchell in this and my bomb is
doing a disappearing act drainpipe
actual drainpipe yeah like a tree trunk
all right you're pushing me now you're
pushing it sir okay I'm a fridge did you
know if it was really hot fine but I
like might have been little bit more
flattering and this isn't that right
Naomi if these ones are getting up these
ones will rate four out of ten oh
they're two peas no I think I bought
another pair this is well it's not the
exact same pair but this is the linen
pair and I like a linen pant they look
nice that name I would wear them so
quickly they look like they're the same
they're completely different these are
way more nicer quality these aren't
great let me try these ones on these
ones are way better than the other ones
way better and cooler
probably us the polyester doesn't stick
like the other ones do this one feels oh
joy this is actually it could be a look
I wouldn't wear them together darling I
mean well I mean this is not a look
you wear them together that's what I
meant to say all right and it'd be good
for like a hot day for like summer
holidays these would be my holiday pants
yeah would you rate them I give them six
or seven strong six plus that's my baby
having your beauty is a strong
oh my favorite my favorite color my
favorite color like tan caramel and
we've got another rib oh Lord I love
everything about this besides the length
of it but let me try it on it might be
all right you know I like it it's nice
your figure look great in it
the color is nice what would you call
that Brown Goldie brown well they could
it mustard but I could the caramel
yeah it's caramel your figure looks good
with this I'm gonna catch you all the
way up with this one the figure looks
the figure looks great on this one the
color is nice the quantity it looks kind
of new doesn't you know Cora is decent
yeah you don't seem to like it though
would you be happy with me going out in
this then I don't have a problem with
you wearing that little show I'm
insecure okay okay I trust my wife it's
like a caramel it's not really mustard
it said mustard but this is like caramel
caramel and chocolate you great here
what do you think I like it I think it's
really nice I like the color I like the
fit you look great feel naked in this
there I can't lie do I not look naked is
it in one word when look the nips are
fully contained there's no there's no
escaping nipples flying out of the sky
and ifs in wind no she's not what I'll
be honest with you there isn't and
that's why I like like this kind of mine
that's right something is but not like
it's not like we did please be sure your
your whole clipping but crease isn't
flying out the back of it of the it's
alright I like it I'm surprised you you
don't seem to like no I do like it I do
like it it is a lot for me like I'm not
used to wearing so much and you know
it's there like the nudie fleshy color
makes me feel even more like you know
whatever but I feel like you know this
doesn't suit my skin it just feels like
really nude and then it's tight and
short and low person I'm surprised I
figure yet
another strap no no this is meant to be
that it's quite tight that's the one
thing yeah it's tight it's definitely
tight but you can see smiled Fupa I
would rate that seven that's a strong
seven arts agree I agree I don't even
want Mike to see this because I feel
like he's going to say something funny
about this but I'm never going to show
you guys here I'm having slight second
thoughts on it it's nice it's on trend
yeah I think if we could ever get good
be cute I think it could be cute on I
think Michaels gonna have a lot to say
about this because it's reminding me of
something now all right let's just try
it on let's challenge I really like this
let's see what what this is are you
going scuba dive a Clio wetsuit yeah
that made of wet it looks like a wetsuit
material where would you wear that that
you know that fit to a festival no you'd
be roasting to be roasting a never a
portable toilet so you'd have to deep
ant the whole thing I really like it I
don't know where I wear this idea if you
were going scuba diving all right
deep-sea snorkelling awesome I'm not
going deep-sea snorkelling before you
people in the market for some snorkeling
kit I really like this outfit what you
very kick I don't wreck it highly
because I just don't know what you're
doing with it like where we'd go or what
would you wear it for or just like it
afternoon tea all right I'm gonna rate
this 5 out of 10 because I just don't
know I'm not quite sure what to make of
it all right enjoy your scuba diving oh
let me just speak to the people oh gods
oh gods I might like it I like it
do you know what I like the color what
you like the kind of right yeah it's all
right you know you're lying
no the same issue the last one I don't
know why you're gonna wear that to my
age but I don't mind it
the road and you look nice would you
rate this six five and a half I think I
knew I was going to endless I wanted you
know to put some like la stuff on but
yeah no no LA in London body I don't
think if it is cutting it for me I just
have to show the level of camel edge
we're not even gonna call it camel we're
gonna call it camel itch that I have
going on right here it is singing that
you know it sounds come on mate
oh they sing they say Michael
anything wrong with you I mean I like
the principle but for me it's not for me
but I can see it like some of the girl
looking absolutely fantastic in this
just not me darling just mommy this is
oh whoa skim coat okay and company it's
no fun okay here we go here's this one
yes it's alright quite like that yeah
do we see it cause it's on the side yeah
what is it being down the side forward
pocket it's just for decoration yeah I
think the Zips not necessary
yeah but it's alright sure you've got
good legs you've definitely got a good
leg so things that look good for you
yeah I got a rate this one maybe at six
or seven overall like I love a crop that
comes out like this I say this all the
time people and it's nice it's just a
little casual summer sweat set very very
nice alright I do like the details I
like this this is so easy for me to wear
and now start stuff like this and I
don't hate really short shorts like as
long as they're not like seeing half my
cheek I'm down we can rock with this and
this is a nice set with like some chunky
trainers fashioned over a fashion okay
some last bits here ah I'm not gonna say
what I'm gonna say
I think someone's gonna have something
to say about these but you know
worthy you ready I like it this one this
one's a good one
all of it the love the top that top is
nice that's a bit sizing here nice top
says good vibes it's a nice little
slogan it's a nice color
like I said before the yellow is a good
color for you but yeah I like it the
shorts I don't love the shot and I hate
them but I do love the top yeah I don't
mind you know tie up design I like the
logo it doesn't hanging Venus as well
there's a video like a flaccid penis but
that's what kind of gives it a bit more
swag what flaccid penis my finger so my
thoughts I love this I love everything
about it
the I can't get enough with the shorts
to be honest these are actually
different to the other shorts I have and
the reason I thought you might hate the
shorts is because Michael cycles and so
he's got the cycling shorts I've met the
pad when having chronic so I always feel
like you've look at me like where the
hell are you going in the shorts that he
basically cycles in every day but the
t-shirt it's so nice good vibe though
you can kind of like I didn't though is
that it is thick but my last two bits
here oh I think there's a black version
actually I'll try those on and then mash
this little mesh top
do you remember I won't for this season
of being obsessed with mesh I wonder
like how I'm gonna wear this that would
I wear black bra underneath this maybe
let me see I like this I like this one
definitely is that my favorite no but
see to that yes it's a mesh top babe but
not seafood in my car you know what's up
ways is you stop okay would you quit I
can lie little purple move no yeah like
it aspires cool Styles not too
it's not grandma but it's not to like
juveniles like yeah nice balance there
this is me in like clothing this is mean
connect love
that's a good look this is actually
could be the best look yes
oh great high five high five good you
work would you rate it well rated well
pick it I rate the top maybe like an
eight or nine I'd say yeah it's a good
pick pants I think maybe like an eight
or nine as well I mean push me but
definitely a seven or eight I love this
I love it that's a keeper that's
definitely a keeper okay guys that is it
let's get some fun of Watson all right
guys we are done it's nice to see you
back on my channel it's been the world
Bey and I thought you could rape my
outfit but we were on the same
wavelength I feel for like look for that
I think we agreed on most of it pretty
much roasted which is surprising
actually yeah we seek more things to
each other gradually everything yes we
are so yeah guys that is it hobby erase
my outfit maybe we can do another
shopping excursion experience sounds
good sounds good at some point it sucks
I don't know when I don't know cuz I
knew quite trust him if I be honest if
you actually like session over I know
that some of you guys have messaged me
about like shipping and delivery and
that but you don't get returns and you
get gift vouchers I don't like all that
bit and you know even me neither had to
deal with some issues when it comes to
Matt's receiving staff or like not
wanting center staff and some quality
not being great but then most of the
items I think they're kind of killing it
and then if you search the site properly
you can find like cute casual items like
this and you can also find your like
booty sock wear as well so yeah okay
guys thank you for watching and I will
see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
