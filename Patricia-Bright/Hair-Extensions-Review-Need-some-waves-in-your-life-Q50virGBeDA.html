there's gonna be a bit different because
this is gonna be a pair of you and I
really don't review hair you guys see me
with the same hair for the past two
years over than once
I'm always wearing the same hair and
that's the hair by cells well I'm very
happy to try out other people's hair and
give you an honest and honest review so
this hair is by miss Nadine I do look
quite different I do feel a bit like a
bit of a big head like a lot of hair um
I haven't really used to it but we'll
see we'll see and it is the Brazilian
natural straight now there we go we've
just discussed the fact that I don't
believe in all this Brazilian blah blah
blah hair it's like a Chinese hair
process or virgin Indian hair a real
virgin definitely said I believe that
this hair is for high quality virgin
Indian hair and there's nothing wrong
with that that is perfect that's really
what you want if you want a natural wave
and wearing I'm eighteen inches on the
bottom and two packets of 16 inches and
these packets are really really full so
you'll find I'm actually wearing two two
and a half two and three-quarters I
couldn't use it all and look how big my
head looks look at it like it's so big
there's so much they're all made up
already
and I need to take some of this out I'm
not used to wearing big hair at this I
feel a bit strange with my two and a
half packets and some people were like
millions of packets like I can't believe
it can even be done um as a quick review
I would definitely say one the hair was
very very soft you know but virgin hair
should be soft that you shouldn't have
any problems with it it's not too shiny
but it's not drying actually I see some
of this hair and they just looked dry
and people putting serum and everything
on it you shouldn't have to put anything
on it it's nice it's not it's not too
dry but it's not too shiny and basically
what I love about virgin hair is that
sometimes you get a packet that's really
nice and sometimes you get a package
that really isn't that nice I found that
my 18 inch here's one that you can see
here look at look at that pattern lovely
lovely lovely lovely perfect right one
of the packets of 16 was a knee a bit
bum it was alright basically and
just didn't have as nice a wave as the
18-inches had and then the other pack of
16 inches is perfect so I put you know
the 18 inches that I didn't like so much
near the bottom and the 16 inches in the
middle and then the nice 16 inches on
the top so it kind of all worked out
quite well which I hope you can see so
far it is not tangled it's very smooth
yeah yeah yeah I like it I wouldn't say
I have any issues with it so far in
terms of tangling but I've not won it
for that long however I do think it
sheds a little bit now I've been at sea
literally because I'm used to zero
shedding the hair I had did not shed I
don't know some miracle wefts but this
is just a very few bits of strands
nothing that is like oh my gosh this
hair shedding just normal shedding the
color is a natural black that I've got
and I really like it the fact that it's
quite a dark black sometimes you get
quite light brown even my mom sometimes
it's a bit hit or miss with the colors
like brown or darker brown but this was
a nice and nice but Brett but I think
that this is it because I got a really
good packet of hair and they are 95 to
105 grams as I said these are very full
packets okay so three are actually
suffice between yeah three to two and a
half are really suffice I would
definitely say that I'm very good can be
dyed it can be straightened it can be
card all the good things that um virgin
hair should be able to do and I've done
and it's reusable they say it can last
up to a year but I have never seen I've
never worn her extensions up to a year
personally I'm very much of a change it
all up all the time type of person
however you know six months to me is it
is fair enough that's it really as I
said I'm not worn it long enough to
really tell you I would what I
completely think about it yet but I will
wait for a while we'll see I said it I
feel really strange I feel really
strange because I'm not used to wearing
here like this you know it's very
glamorous to a bit too done up to me but
it's pretty it's really pretty
I like the wave I'm not straightened it
out yet what do you think
and look nice as well they're not all
thin or dry or anything that's it really
so that's my quick review anyone was
looking for away the you know natural
hair that you can dye just that that
kind of Brazilian II Indian hair look
then I would definitely go and try these
girls out and at least check them out on
their Facebook page so thanks for
watching guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
