how to wear Blazers video and I decided
I would like to do a few more of these
and different how to wear loads of
different styles so I'd really like if
you left some comments below on what
you'd like to see next on how to wear
some like short or play suits
t-shirts white shirts just different
things basically I'd like to do so leave
your comments below and also if you
liked the video please remember to like
and subscribe if you're not subscribed
to my channel so I hope you enjoyed this
video and I'll see you guys later
so black fitted blazer I think is an
essential in any girl's wardrobe it can
be worn over a sweetheart neckline to
give a very sultry effect without
showing too much
some were white longer length blazer
like I'm wearing here is amazing there
vowel neck jumpers and pops of primary
colors just to add some sass to an
outfit so don't think you can go wrong
with a red blazer I love when Blazers
with high neck shirts and high-waisted
trousers it's a really trendy and modern
look in my opinion
right
so finally one of my favorites is the
tweed blades are just the texture and
the elegance of the look is that you can
wear it with anything you can find in
your wardrobe and it just adds a touch
of cost to the outfit
so guys leave a comment below and let me
know which outfit was your favorite
