that I have a few items which is spotty
and a few items which are stripy so I'm
going to show you just two ways that I
wear like a sporty shirt and the way I
wear a stripy shirt and I think
sometimes people struggle with it and
think if you're wearing sports or
stripes just to wear playing things
which is what I've done but you don't
have to do that like I would wear polka
dots like big polka dots with little
polka dots it doesn't bother me
whatsoever but I'll show you how I wear
this shirt and I'll show you how I wear
my structure as well so first of all I'm
just wearing this shirt which is from
monkey which I absolutely love I've been
wearing this loads and I'm wearing like
lots of different bits of accessories
that fun to do it well it kind of dotty
actually like the eyes circle that's
kind of round
these have got round bits on it I don't
know I just tried to make a connection
yeah I think I am there's no connection
I just draw on the accessories that I
could find in my accessory pot so yeah
destroying lots of random bits and then
I'm wearing this new dress that I bought
from H&amp;amp;M for like oh no no I didn't buy
this this belongs to a friend of mine
and she's never got it back but it is
like from H&amp;amp;M and it's like eight pounds
it's just in nude and I tie up the shirt
because I just think it looks nice tied
up but you can tuck it in but I've got
this whole obsession with high waist now
and I like my clothes to like stop
higher up on my waist as well I think it
makes me look slimmer in the middle and
I'm wearing this dress and the moment
was about for those of you who don't
know I have quite a big being big behind
so like if I put some volume here it
kind of reduces in size and it doesn't
look too like Bobby and yeah wearing it
with these tights which are from Primark
I don't if you can see but I'll just
fill me the title from Primark and
they've kind of got hearts on the top
and it kind of looks like a lot pop
socks on but I don't and then my ankle
boots are from H&amp;amp;M so this is how I'm
wearing it and rather than wearing the
shirt kind of all buttoned up
buttoned up like it's a natural shirt
I'm just wearing is like a thing I throw
over his dress okay guys so here is me
in our structure and this is a striped
shirt that I bought from hey Chan in
about a year ago and you can see it's
quite a lot and I think with spots and
stripes they do make quite a statement
so I do like to quite keep it neutral
but you don't have to keep it neutral so
this is this shirt here and I'm going we
have some accessories that kind of poke
out which is for the Topshop and you can
do the button up high but I don't like
that look I just like or no two buttons
I'm undone and I'm wearing it with my
American Apparel leggings and this type
rather than tying it up I'm Jessica I'm
just tucking it in like this which is
really a common way that people wear it
again I just film it and I'm wearing it
with my ankle boots which I bought some
from some random store and that is how I
wear spots and how I wear stripes so
thanks for watching guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
