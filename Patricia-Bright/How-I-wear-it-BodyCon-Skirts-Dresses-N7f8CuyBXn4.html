on body card body con is on my favorite
types of like outfits and styles just
because I'm really feminine and girly
and I think body con actually suits
every figure fat skinny medium curvy
strength whatever seriously I actually
think it works on every single figure
it's just about the way that you do it
and I'm going to show you just for four
or five more things different ways that
I like growing body con and I'll just
kind of talk through how I think it can
relate to different body shapes as well
but follow me I've got my twitter my
facebook everything down below and let
me know what outfit is your favorite cuz
I like to know which outfits you guys
like the most
so anyways hope you enjoyed suggest bye
so my first body con item is a mini
black skirt and then this is the best
the most casual way that you can wear
body con throw it on with a little denim
jacket and a white t-shirt it's
absolutely perfect for all shapes and
sizes
Oh
and open
so if you're not into miniskirts you can
always go for the pencil skirt this is a
great look for body con it sucks you in
and just has the most gorgeous feminine
silhouette which is perfect for all
shapes and all sizes and if you want to
you can show off your curves stripe
somebody con re hit or miss it can
either make you look a bit like a
balloon or look then very skinny go for
the stripes that suits you
horizontal will make you look a bit
wider and vertical
finally I couldn't forget the dress and
I went ahead and decided to wear leopard
print some people don't like all-over
print but you know what I think it's
kind of bold I think it's kind of cute
as long as you ask some formal girdle or
something to tuck your jiggly bits on
the inside it can be very very fattening
so that's for watching guys which one
was your favorite look don't forget to
check me out on Twitter all my links
