today's video is going to be about the
miniskirt and I'm going to show you a
few different ways that I would wear a
miniskirt now the thing is is that you
know I quite like showing my legs and
sometimes there can be a big push from
looking nice and classy to looking
slowly when you wear a miniskirt
so if obviously you're wearing a
miniskirt a boob tube and Jaime boots
you're gonna look a bit bit touch-and-go
now you don't want to look like that in
a miniskirt you want to look elegant you
want to look classy and you still want
to look quite sexy at the same time so
the first way that I would wear a
miniskirt is obviously with a pair of
sheer tights now obviously if I'm going
to wear quite a light den here I would
then put it with a top that doesn't show
too much flesh I could either go for a
jump or I can either go for a round neck
before somebody this place closed oh I
unplug the brain again
so alternatively if I don't want to wear
ties you can go there leg but I think
that again in that situation kind of
need to change your Footwear and rather
than something that shows the whole foot
that shoe cleavage and foot cleavage you
want to go with a boot maybe as it kind
of reduces the amount of flesh that's on
the show but it's still quite a lot of
flesh and you definitely want to cover
up on the top
make up all the time you came back so
another where I like to wear miniskirts
is with patterned tights and tights are
just a bit of style to them and see that
draws attention again to the legs button
unless in a less kind of sexy way just
like all those really cool and
finally I just love to learn miniskirt
with the Blazer because it keeps it
really really smart and really really
chic at the same time even though you've
got legs on show and your skirts quite
sure short you can look really really
classing really really elegant in this
way ok guys hope you really enjoyed that
video I know it's super quick and I hope
it was gave you a few tips bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
