be on basically how to upgrade an old
pair of jeans I found a really old
solely looking pair of jeans in my
wardrobe I thought to myself how can I
make it a bit more trendy a bit more you
know first of all summer worthy so i'm
going to show you exactly how i start
and like fray my jeans basically in the
kind of new trendy shape that is fairly
high so i hope you enjoyed this tutorial
and you find it helpful so guys you can
see the original pair of jeans you can
tell they're absolutely nothing special
but i think they've got a great shape
making a pair of shorts so what I do is
I decide exactly how short I want my
shorts not too sure and then I get a pen
or chalk and draw a line just a little
bit underneath that and obviously I do
this round back and on the other leg so
lay my jeans on the front I fold them
backwards and I'm not too fussed about
Greece's it doesn't have to be made and
with my line I don't throw a straight
line instead I draw a diagonal line
going closer to the crotch I think
diagonal lines look a lot better than
going straight across I think it just
makes groupid anyway my sisters are
fairly blunt but it doesn't matter i'll
get really rough edges but whatever so
when I've done one leg I trace it and
the upper neck might mean that one
that's a bit longer but you can just cut
it off and see what you think so I know
they look a bit wonky I can try them on
and fix any issues I have so next is to
create some points of this stress and
all I do is cut a few little lions and
you'll see how I distress leave later on
they look really cool when they're done
so I purchase some stuff from ebay or
link where i got them form in the
description bar and what i do it i
decide what kind of shape or pattern i
want to go for and line these up there's
so many things you can do I'm really not
that creating this is what I came so to
actually get them in I sit down put my
hand through my shorts and basically
push the stud through there are four
little pins at the back which you can
basically fold underneath do this well
otherwise you will stab yourself when
you're wearing your shoes so next I'm
going to use a more spiky start I got
this from ebay i'll put the link in
description box these are really easy to
use all i do is basically fold my denim
just near the scene and create the
tiniest little hole really small and
they can push the back pick through and
screw on my stud really simple guys I'm
gonna do this all the way up the side
so we are almost there now it's just
time for the fray I use a freezer clip
you can use any type of click root lee
that can grab onto the fabric basically
pull the loose scenes get that edge is
nice and rough really simple and then
we're done so guys this is how I upgrade
an old poem jeans just by scrapping them
up and adding a few shiny studs I hope
you enjoy the video and if you try it
all you want to try it do leave a
comment below let me know thanks for
watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
