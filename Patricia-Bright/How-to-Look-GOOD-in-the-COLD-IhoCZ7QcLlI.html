video is gonna be on how to look hot in
the cold and I just felt like doing this
video because it's snowing here its
fleet here it's gray hair like Engel is
not the most glamorous or country's to
be in and sometimes you just don't feel
like being glamorous when you are
running for trains in the morning and
falling on the ice like I did and you
just don't want to make an effort but
girls we shouldn't do that let's still
look hot even though it's cold you know
it's fashionable trendy but warm at the
same time so I hope this video inspires
some of you who I like wherever you are
that's really cold right now or really
gray right now and just makes me feel
like putting a bit of color a bit of
star and a limit for into your outfit
okay so with this look it's all about
wearing short in the winter some people
say you can't do that but I actually
think you can it all depends on what you
wear up top and how you can secretly
lega so with this look here I just
thought that because I'm wearing back in
the bottom I'd keep this this season's
color trend lots of neons lots of bright
and I've got this kind of lemon cardigan
which is from Zara wan and my chain
which is from South Africa and I'm
wearing my leather shorts which I often
wear in the summer I thought why not
bring them out it is winter but instead
of wearing them in tights basically I
layer on about 3 pairs of I've got 2
pairs of leggings on and a pair of
tights and these are the ways that I can
you know kind of look quite slimline
quite cool in my leather shorts but I
was quite warm on top of that and might
add like a fur jacket as well so if I
keep warm on the top of the Ora and the
bottom
okay guys so this is the next look here
and basically and won't everything
that's quite swim slip line and isn't
really very winter appropriate but again
with something like this it's all about
the layering so I'm wearing a t-shirt
which is really not that warm and you
guys have seen the American power
leggings
I'm wearing them all the time because
they're actually so warm and I have
these kind of shoes on from Topshop but
I'll show you how I use accessories to
make them look a lot better so number
one you can go for like a cardigan to
add some additional layers to it so I
really think like scarfs are amazing and
I got this amazing scarf which is just
really beautiful it's got like pom-poms
on the end and literally like you fling
that on you that you're good to go you
look ready I really love kind of just
laying up with really nice pieces of
accessory okay guys so this looks a
little bit different for me but again I
think it's another way to look hot in
the cold and with this I'm kind of
wearing like a beanie hat which is very
very different for me cuz it's a bit
casual and I'm wearing it with like my
leather jacket and I think that loafer
jackets are really really warm in the
winter especially if you layer up and
especially if they're quilted because
the quilts seem to keep in lots and lots
of heat I'm wearing like all my like
ethnic jewelry that I picked up on my
travels in Asia and I just feel like it
goes really well with this look you know
kind of a casual I'm so cool look and
then I'm wearing it with this tool
t-shirt which is this season color so
add a bit of color to drop outfit or
just some denim leggings and some ankle
boots
it's not okay guys so this is the final
look and basically it's about having
hats hats can really really help keep
you warm but you don't have to pick like
a bunny or the app you can go for a fell
kind of Fedora type hat and I've got one
of these hats I don't know what they're
called but they're this really big and
they're actually really warm and they
keep your ears warm and also just to say
can still wear dresses in the winter
just go for something with like long
sleeves and like a thick cotton material
and then you can still feel warm and
really cool this dress this hat is from
H&amp;amp;M this dress is from Zara recently
this belt is 50 or vintage and these
boxes are vintage this box this bag is
vintage and I've just got leggings on
and the same thing starts very before
okay guys so I hoped you enjoyed that
video let me know which outfits your
favorite which looks your favorite cuz
it gives me a good idea of what kind of
trends you guys like and like if you
want more fashion videos and I will see
you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
