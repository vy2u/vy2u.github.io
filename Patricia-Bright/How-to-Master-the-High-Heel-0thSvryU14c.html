video is going to be all about walking
in heels at the request of a few of my
subscribers so I was hoping that this
video would be kind of a little bit of a
help video for those who are new to
heels or those who are not very
comfortable in heels I just want an idea
of how they can kind of find a bit more
comfortable to wear them so there are a
few things to consider the first thing
is that you have many many options you
don't always have to wear like a really
thin or any really high heel but if you
want to wear high heels I think there
are about 3 main things that you should
go one of the main things you should go
for it's a wedge so a pair of wedge
shoes just makes it a lot easier it kind
of has a bigger surface area a bigger
surface area so it means it takes off
the pressure on certain points but what
does can still become a bit
uncomfortable and wearing them and it
all depends on what the sole is like
this is a really wooden sole so after a
while it does get uncomfortable at the
balls of my feet but you get used to it
and also another thing to do is to wear
platform so this is also a wedge
platform and what it means is that your
arch is lower and it means that your
it's going to be a lot more comfortable
for you so these are for instance about
5 inches but because of the platform it
only means that I'm walking on about 3
inches
anything it knows it differently my
favorite type of high hill is the thick
chunky Hill like the chunky Hill has
been in trend for quite a while but you
know I've always loved chunky Hills and
this is a example here these are from
Primark and it's got you know another
five inch Hill ish and a mini platform
but it's really comfortable because your
weight again is dispersed amongst the
hill so it's not that really really
- rush of Maine an example is the
Stiletto hill so that's a thin hill
but once again I've got an example here
within Hill with a platform I really
think that shoes should always have a
platform really high hills really really
high hills should have a platform and
when they kind of discrete like this one
they're very very attractive of
everybody these are from our day so
let's start walking high hills
the first thing you want to have is a
surface that you can comfortably
practice walking on now a carpet is
ideal indoors but just remember how it
feels you know you're in her and the
house you know will come on it's not how
it's going to feel when your wine you
know outside in the club your high heels
or you know on the streets and the
pavement on cobbled streets hmm no it's
not gonna be about that it gives you a
good idea to kind of start practicing
and I'm not gonna tell you how to walk
I'm sure you know how to put one foot in
front of the other
I think weight thing you need to
consider is your back and kind of how
you stand when you kind of just want to
keep is straight and upright as possible
so you don't look like you're like that
that's like all I seen guys walk like
that or something like that we just hope
no you're gonna keep really really
straight but you don't ever like a storm
Ibrahim it's so that you just want to
keep your balance basically back up
straight just feel comfortable rest on
one leg as well that's something I
really do I just kind of take some
pressure off one and you can kind of
drop for one city up and move that you
can kind of just practice your walk and
it's just about keeping your back
straight really it's really hard to
teach someone how to walk in the others
but my opinion is that niche keep your
back straight arms behind and just don't
feel comfortable with it it's kind of
let your your your actual walk a bit
more exaggerated and as it is it's from
definitely heel-toe heel-toe
your toe
now drop of dancing in heels
let's get dancing the wonderful thing
about feels is that you have to move
your feet when you're dancing you can
just go boot just move your kneecaps
move the kneecaps okay
there's no music like that mmm you know
just move the top up and you look good
you got that you'll feel on building
your comfortable you see how that works
dancing girls whoa with their hair and
so I really hope you enjoyed that video
and it makes it a bit easy for you where
you're walking in heels if not just
stand still look pretty and get a taxi
