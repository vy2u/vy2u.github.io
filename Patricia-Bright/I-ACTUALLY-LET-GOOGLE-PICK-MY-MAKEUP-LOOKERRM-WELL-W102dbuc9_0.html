hello there beautiful people welcome
back to my channel I hope you are doing
well today I'm coming to you better
phrase darlings because I've been seeing
this tag absolutely everywhere and
people are getting inspiration from
Google to create an entire makeup look
and I feel like recently I've been
actually being way more creative and
having a lot more fun with makeup so
when I saw this like tag and I saw
people doing out like yes I'm gonna do
this because hopefully Google throws up
something that is relatively creative so
if you're not already subscribed to my
channel subscribe you can also put your
notifications on if you want to know
when I upload which is probably like on
a Wednesday ish and a Sunday or Saturday
ish and then obviously you can follow me
on my Instagram and my Twitter I am on
that and I love talking to you guys
especially when it comes out to making
videos I'm loving all your suggestions
so follow me on those platforms and we
can get right into this video okay so
how I've seen this tag working is that
basically people type into Google their
initials or they type in makeup products
into their Google browser and do you
know what I want to do this drugstore
darling so I'm gonna use the drugstore
goodies that I have to do this and I'm
just gonna type in Pb Pb look to see
what comes on also says PB look-alikes
and I'm gonna go ahead into images and
see what I can find
oh okay into interesting not that
interesting actually put it potentially
quite boring however I can see a little
bit of love island action right about
here I cannot wait for love island to
come back this season I'm seeing all
these bright pinks and these bright
oranges but do you know what's really
attracting me right now it's this what
is this that what is this what I don't
know what this is this looks cute it
looks pink and I feel inspired and I
might be creative who is this little
character this is cute
marcin and bubblegum Marceline and
bubblegum Princess Bubblegum
that is her name who is this character I
do not know who this character is
however I feel like she's channeling me
Princess Bubblegum and I got a pink wig
so I think I'm gonna do this I'm gonna
be inspired directly by this and I feel
like I've got a lot of makeup that can
help me recreate something around this
okay let's get into this so I want to
keep it drugstore I'm gonna go in with
my two favorite drugstore foundations
L'Oreal True Match and Bourjois healthy
mix this foundation I actually did like
a sponsored video for them and ever
since then I just love the foundation
it's really good I gotta say people you
have to try stuff that you are not that
familiar with especially when it comes
to being on YouTube you cannot just have
to push yourself out and to be honest
and bored I've been watching a whole
load of Netflix today a whole load of
Jessica Jones and I was like you know I
need to be creative
I need something to like motivate me and
I wanted to say like if you ever want to
try YouTube or you want to be creative
or you want to do something fun you
don't have to break the bank to do it
and this is why I wanted to do a
drugstore version of this video people I
would love it if you got involved jump
on YouTube jump on creative platforms or
Instagram and - something cute that
makes you feel good you know
okay my face is done I got a little dose
of healthy myths and as I was going for
my collection I was like you know what
I'm gonna put on my purple wig this baby
hasn't seen the light of day since
Coachella
but it's time I think she makes an
appearance okay so I decided let me
completely embody the look I've got some
lavender in my hair right about now and
I found this palette this is the BH
phonetic weekend festival palette I
haven't ever used this before because I
did think the colors in here we're
looking all kinds of dramatic and
luminous but I think it's perfect for
what Google has picked out for me
there's a whole load of extra luminous
pinks and purples and I'm gonna use
these so I'm gonna go in with a bit of
the makeup revolution concealer on my
lid it's just gonna brighten it up a
little bit so the colors are really pop
when they go on there
scared I'm looking at this pilot and I'm
scared I hope one pink so it's really
yes well it was really a lot we're gonna
go with this purple shade right on the
outside go pigment that is doing the
most this is so unlike me I've just got
to tell you this is a very unlike me
this is why I like doing challenges
challenges are definitely a way for you
to kind of go outside of your comfort
zone and have some fun like life is too
short to be just stuffy I'm just like
I'll try it on when we go we've escaped
almost clear Phillip I just need a
little something in the transition I
don't even know what to do I'm just I
don't really used to color okay so I'm
gonna take that shade swag and I'm just
going to bring it across merge it's how
I it kind of really does go with the
window doesn't it and I definitely feel
like I'm looking like Princess Bubblegum
in my own like black way okay so what's
the girl gonna do on the lid I mean I'm
gonna keep this shade wicked and it's
giving me like some of her loving the
dress rides and yeah I'm feeling that
wicked let's go with wicked on the lid
because I think I'm gonna go for pink on
the lips oh oh
it's pretty oh that's really nice oh
never have I ever ever ever ever done a
look like this in my life and my whole
life existed this palette is beautiful
though if you're looking to have fun or
be dramatic this is a really nice
palette for that and then I'm gonna just
drag this swept under my eye and I'm
telling you that mascara and eyeliner I
feel are gonna really play a big big
role in making this eye look come
together Princess Bubblegum also has
this like gold crown so I'm just
go really gold in my inner my inner eye
so there's the shade here called
euphoria which I think will be do just
what I need Oh Bahria
that is major that is really major not
to be honest I feel like my eye lips
never come together on - I've got liner
on and mascara and lucky enough I've
been able to partner with soap &amp;amp; Glory
darling a drugstore brand you've got
that amazing range of goodies and this
is a thick and fast mascara and the
carbon black extreme eyeliner which I
think I'm going to need and I'm probably
gonna put this on my lipid you can find
soap and glory at Boots and yeah they're
kind of kind of popping I'm just gonna
go with this super cat liner because
your girl your girl's eyes need some
liner what I love is then you've got
this the tip this thick felt that thick
felt is going to give me a really nice
thick line oh that is jet black that's
so good I feel like an amazing liner can
transform an entire look in like seconds
and I'd like to take my line up forward
just a little bit because it gives me a
longer I look when I apply my liner this
is what mainly the area where I say
Patricia don't it up don't mess it up
because honestly if you get it wrong the
look is trash I feel like I just did a
really good wing normally I'm not gonna
sit here and say I'm the best at a wing
but when I have a good wing it's a good
wing so next up I'm gonna go in with the
thick and fast mascara from soap &amp;amp; Glory
high definition collagen coat mascara
for me I need the mascara to be able to
snatch my baby bottom lashes because
they're near on invisible so let's just
get it on mascara is giving me you need
to layer it but once you get your second
later on you have lift off
with a little work your girl has bottom
lashes this is nice
so I'm gonna be honest of you my
favorite drugstore lashes or a little
bit of an ordeal wispy I'm still a fan
and I still wear them however I feel
like this look cool so some more drum on
the lashes I'm gonna go ahead with my
backstage Beauty lashes I really like
these and they are actually really
affordable as well
okay lashes are on this is all coming
together nicely I'm gonna go ahead and
just add something sealer now I'm gonna
use makeup revolution because it's only
five pounds all right
love this concealer I like to mix 12 and
13 together oh this is another goodie
from soap &amp;amp; Glory and this is called
wonder bronze I gotta say I love the
kind of like homage to like vintage
beauty that you can find on soap &amp;amp; Glory
and it does have all whoa it's pretty
this is definitely gonna give me that PB
look I think that is gorgeous you know
where you see these do are you a swallow
or you a selector
I'm gonna swirl swirl Donny beautiful
it's got kind of a OH
almost like a bronzy gold this is like a
bronze very nice oh that's beautiful so
while that I'm gonna take this kind of
bronzy color down my nose you know what
bronze is actually quite a nice and like
a gentle highlight shade I feel like I
feel like the only thing I'm missing is
the pink so I'm gonna go in with this
shade here candy venom from Fenty and
this is a bright pink that's we took
that the look from okay - okay I'm gonna
actually add this pumping gloss on top
just
I'm not gonna lie do you feel like the
pink makes it look weird it takes it
from being a look to just being a very
much PB thanks Google for putting this
together for me because pimp pink and
purple don't normally go together or do
they I don't know
guess we pick my makeup today google
pick my makeup don't look like an anime
character well come and look at the
inspiration I'm showing right now what
does he think of when look I feel like
I'm having a lot of fun it's my
inspiration yes that is it's cute right
that is nice
can this be my everyday look from now on
I don't see why not ya know I like it
that isn't really not colorful I like
you like it I love it no it's not but
it's nice a bit bit more inspired and do
something different right me and Google
are friends now I think I can forgive
Google for every time I've typed in an
element and they told me I was dying you
know every time I went on oh check and I
thought I had something really wrong
with me thank you google I am feeling
this it says bubblegum was actually just
giving me out of life and give me girls
and she's inspired me and the one thing
I say about beauty and makeup it it's
about having fun like literally I don't
take myself too seriously I like to have
fun you know and here we go we are
looking like Princess Bubblegum because
that is what Google told me that I would
look like so I am feeling this what do
you guys think should I try and have a
little bit more fun with makeup
sometimes do some Dramat this isn't even
dramatic compared to some people this is
just pb's version of dramatic okay type
in your initials into Google and see
what it throws up maybe we will inspire
you to get a little bit creative like
it's done me yeah that's it guys so
