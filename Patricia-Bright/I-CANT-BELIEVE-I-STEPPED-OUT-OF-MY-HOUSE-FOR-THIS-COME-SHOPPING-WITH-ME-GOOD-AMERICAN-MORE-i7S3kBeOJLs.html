it's my dream an accent like yes funny
hello beautiful people welcome to my
channel I hope you are doing well and
today I thought it'd be nice for us to
take it out to the streets honey yes I
decided to hit the streets and kind of
do like a changing room Diaries stop
video and bring you guys on a shop with
me but don't shop in I remember but
growing up and it's like what you're
doing today I'll go shopping like you
broke it 30 pounds in your pocket just
about and it's like what we're gonna do
on the weekend you go shopping or
basically go to the wall and just have
fun and have a look at what's in the
shops and that kind of stuff and just
meet up with your girlfriend
and I literally do not go to the shot at
all and because they don't work in like
the city or town I literally do not go
to the shops and my online shop a lot
but I have been finding the more more
shop online is that the expectation is
so so far from the reality most of the
time when I pick clothing I need like a
tote when I'm wearing it I just look off
key it's not suiting me no potato sack
just that's the combination and I end up
either returning a lot of items which
you guys know or having items in my
closet that I'd say why the hell is this
here I look awful in there some why is
this here so I thought you know what
we're gonna do we're gonna kind of do
like a changing room Diaries I'm gonna
bring shopping with me and we're just
gonna see what it's like and this is the
first time I've ever done this so we're
just gonna grow and maybe get better I
will appreciate your feedback I think
today we're gonna go to Selfridges
okay Selfridges is a little bit fancy
it's a department store where you can
get your Gucci or Prada your Balmain
your fancy stuff but you can also get
Topshop and there wasn't like a Primark
in there as well so it's got a little
bit of everything but let's see what we
can find in store before we get into
this video to make sure you are
subscribed because I appreciate you guys
and I want you to know that I've
uploaded and they're notifications on
follow me on my social which
down below we're gonna go shopping we're
gonna come back and we're gonna share
with the goody okay so I am about to get
ready to hit the shops and I'm taking a
little moment to myself
I'm not gonna lie it feels a little bit
weird but yeah going to the shops as a
kid was literally the weekend pastime
it's just what you do but if you're like
a lot of us just we don't do that
anymore I want to bring it back okay so
when I go shopping I try to keep my
outfit kind of simple black vests black
leggings
we've got fake Sun going on right now in
England so a warm coat is necessary okay
guys this is my finish shopping look
Jean for my little crossbody louisv bag
just because I love to keep my
hands-free when I'm shopping and then
honestly it's literally leggings and a
black top so let's get going let's get
going those of you who know me I'm
always on the train I'm a public
transport girl for life I am impatient
little confession I have had any
breakfast it's a fuel up I'm gonna get
myself just just a little tiny hamburger
and we right look at it up the wonderful
retreat that is Selfridges just to
notice my inspiration
this is such as possible
somehow I ended up in the store that I
cannot appalled and I saw the Balmain
blazer in the white ok this it is
gorgeous absolutely gorgeous let's try
it on
it is always so the shoulders are Shh
I'm gonna leave this bTW because this is
my whole shopping trip all right going
to make my way to a little bit more
affordable part of Selfridges what I
love is that you can shop the expensive
and designer but then you can also find
Topshop and Primark and other brands so
yeah Reese's daughter just seen you
online
this is just in reality that you
actually need to be walking out your
blanket okay I'm into all things soft
and furry right now I was trying to look
at some jeans jeans these are from Urban
Outfitters their mom jeans I think
they're gonna be okay maybe not to me
yeah okay so these are a high-waisted
module there is no bum game here these
are no no no no next up on my Levi's
jeans these are 95 pounds geez oh sure
crotch they're super low rider the
crotch is really short and I feel like
there's no way to describe everything my
bum looks like an actual pig I think it
is a bit those nets are going in the
hood American jeans the shoppers page
okay but these have a good America on
its own
they're actually mutually my favorite
the best give me one moment pretty nice
so I tried on a ton of buttons and I'm
never trying to talk about my feeling I
think Christmas tree long yeah like
spring thank you you know it's a cheek
you know I like this this is Christmas
party of them oh my gosh this is this
Victoria Beckham top this jumper is so
it nice if they cute
right here look at this amazing
I want an almighty that is essential
it's a white team
this is my actual jacket
I think I mean a Christmas made right
now
they got some goodies in Topshop there's
a lot of black I need to try at the
bottom this is the size 12 but he looks
IR and it's a nice dinner wearing it's
like velvet Queen Queen love it this is
delusional this many thoughtful I feel
like my wardrobe needs something like
this okay I don't fit into these my toes
already got caught in the gaps and I can
tell it's a mismatch on my wife you
started your fully stuff I'm not getting
you to be is ready the Buddha said no I
said he told me the teacher was selected
this is why I don't go I think I don't
like this one
well it's enough
so tops give me kind of double boob I do
quite like it that I think it's alright
this top is it right like my string this
is enough this is really nice this is 49
pounds though but it's okay I kind of
want to look it back the shoes but I
never get done so tied into shipping you
betcha kind of a walk out there's like
beat the sweat on my face right now
yeah
okay so I am back I'm not gonna lie it
is a couple of days later I completely
forgot how much of a workout shopping
actually is I swear I feel like I need
in today's recovery afterwards shopping
I would say try it I was sworn in as
part no one and I will do something I
don't if it's just me Baga wow this is
excellent like really Wow like what but
I'm back I'm back we've shopping goodies
it's my dream annex hello
I love the Selfridges value so just
bright and bougie like yeah it's funny
yes you don't even got Primark in here
or barley you never know right I took I
forgot what the shopping experience is
absolutely not like it was good though
and also it's gonna say that like I'm a
lot lighter than when I shop online I
feel like I'm way more protective of
what I pick up what I try on because
who's got time to carry their toes and
find themselves back in the shop to do a
turns like no I don't know better get
down foot it so and went to Selfridges
which is you know one of London's like
really nice department stores one of my
favorite ones I will say though that I
felt like you know sometimes when they
like following you around the store
you're like please let one of you rebel
in store like that I'm not trying to
sell anything relax
I don't know why they do that they need
to like just take a sit back sit back
and just let CCTV
thing or security I just felt a little
bit intimidated in store fuck ended up
picking up this good America jeans and I
wanted to be skeptical I really wanted
to be skeptical about these yeah but
listen my bomb looked kushti in these I
tried to leave our cheese I tried on
their mom jeans from Urban Outfitters
and another pair of jeans none of them
fit as well as these jeans fit however
how much do these jeans cost these she
is worse than no person ease or worse I
got size 25 which is a size zero can you
imagine a hundred and eighty-five pounds
but in America they cost a hundred and
fifty five dollars so they cost a lot
more to get these jeans here in the UK
and what I will say is that they're not
then I like super thick denim or really
hard denim they're not like a Levi's
pair of denim nothing like that
whatsoever
but they did fit nicely and when I asked
myself why they were 485 pounds my mind
is slightly perplexed cuz Levi's jeans
were only 95 pounds so these are the
good America jeans are and I've got to
be honest to you I do think they are
genuinely quite good of all the jeans I
tried out there the ones that made my
bum just just had a little bit of lift
there was no unhappy bum knee it kind of
just had a little bit of a you know
something going on I will say there are
not the thickest jeans in the world but
you know what they seem quite nice but
again 195 pounds and I have to show you
guys the ankles because the ankles look
really confused they can't quite decide
if they want me to be an elf
but I feel like I'm gonna let the ankle
slide for the fit of the trousers but
I'll show you yeah this and please
ignore them my ankle looks really white
I don't quite understand what what had
happened was we ran out of material and
it's not an accident it's on both sides
is that it were a hero as well so
I don't know what that's about but other
than that there were well-well-well
fitting jeans and then I found this top
which was from Urban Outfitters which
was really Christmassy and cute and I
thought that it looked really really
nice under this is what this top looks
like but now that I'm here I feel like I
kind of like a shiny stuffed Christmas
turkey I don't know it's just isn't
fitting me I mean I think about all this
- fucking little black sky that would
have to be really really fitted because
this top is giving me more volume that I
need I'm looking a bit slow batchi
okay I'm not I'm not I'm not mad anymore
I was mad for a second because I was
like why you I didn't for extra stones
to me it looked nice in the fitting room
okay um you know I didn't want you guys
to think I was crazy I wanted to show
you what this would look like but the
cute little just a little skirt on this
is Thomas guy did this stuff so just a
cute little skirt just to add and it
will shape and stuff to it now that
looks nice you see and that's so
important to be able to pair items that
you have in your closet with items that
you buy so you have to have a vision for
it okay we got we got a vision vision of
love I got to have you this now so after
that I left that section of the shop but
I was in I found two pieces but that's
like I feel like when you shop in the
shops it is more expensive than shopping
online no lie
yeah and this is what you can't be doing
17:25 piece hole holes and it's you four
piece cut so next I went into Topshop
which is a red one for me it's not rare
online and I do my stuff on top shop
here man so love chop shop might well do
a Topshop or let me know if you want to
see that and then and then you pick up
things that you wouldn't see him the
what you would see in the website and I
would have totally ignore this right and
saw it in store and it was so beautiful
it was this velvet you gorgeous yes
sweetheart listen I said this in a
changing room it looked nothing but
bushi right there was no pot in here no
Muji thought just Boosh
come on look
that okay so here is this suit that I
got from Topshop and just put this
little roll it on underneath excite felt
like I needed to add just a little
thought to it this is definitely really
bougie come on walk in with a velvet
blazer listen how nice is this
I love a trouser suit and obviously this
is a trouser suit that's very unique it
was very different
I'm just I'm just here for it do you not
listen 'is it needs heels though I feel
like I need to show you guys this is
some heels on let me live I've got my
heels on yes it's been a long time since
I've worn these jeez oh very good I'm
very uncomfortable very uncomfortable
right now but yeah you guys get it right
ah this suit is just so nice this is
great for partly seasons or corporate
parties or if you want to get dressed up
for work coming with your pink velvet
blazer who can tell you anything no one
no cut so nothing price of these
trousers are 42 pounds the price of the
Blazer is 75 pounds Wow it's expensive
something I've been missing listen your
girl got earrings can you believe I'm
about to she's about to do it you guys
know I've always said I really hate what
I look like with earrings on I just feel
like an auntie I don't know I just felt
on - yeah just a little bit like I don't
know I don't know but I think it's a new
a dawning of a new day so earrings
galore and again I would never buy
earrings online but here we have beens
from Topshop and then I bought this top
which now I'm sitting here what wearing
this top I feel like they're niching
very similar laughter the same thing and
they have to do the one in one out raw
black listen I'm not doing that running
run out raw and this top right here look
at that it's very similarly saw in the
changing room I love a mesh polo neck
I'm obsessed of them I don't know why I
always have been
this is super cute
yeah I love it is this top I've just put
a little vest on underneath it which
makes it a little bit more wearable I
love it
400 grams it was quite expensive it's
really nice and obviously just looking
that I have something very similar in my
wardrobe I'm trying to have this new
rule of 1 in one hour so one of them's
got to go this one or the other one the
one I don't lost on everything 5 pounds
this is one from Topshop I prefer this
one I just feel like this one's nicer
and I just paid it with this scarf like
I love a high neckline with like lace
detail like this really nice really cool
