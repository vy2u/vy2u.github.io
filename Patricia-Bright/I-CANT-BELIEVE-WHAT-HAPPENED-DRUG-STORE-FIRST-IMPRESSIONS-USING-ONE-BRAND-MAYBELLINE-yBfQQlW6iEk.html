not oh honey no this makes me look
expensive it's cute though hey guys
welcome to my channel I've got another
drugstore - for you today and I've got
this look here which is basically a 1
that brand face and I went into super
drug which is here we go super drug
super drug where's my receipt I have my
receipt for you guys Oh lost it okay I
bought all of a Maybelline product and
maybe it was really easy for me to watch
you know what I forgot to do I forgot to
spray you know what there's a makeup
locking set in spray and I didn't use it
just just
Oh that setting spray looks a bit more
like milk yeah like vice isn't like milk
why have I got white specks um what the
why why is it done ha
no and it's not coming off that is no
yacht you got no
that's just ruined the whole look I just
spent an hour doing this look oh it's
just got so real with the setting spray
which just left all these like white
marks on me I think it's because I
didn't shake it but look it's all over
me the face that it made was absolutely
gorgeous using all the products from
Maybelline my shopping experience was
good some of that you know I love you it
I've reviewed it so you can see my
drugstore - and then you can watch the
video I'm kind of upset
this is face isn't it's not how it just
was five minutes ago but yet drugstore
dashing with Maybelline but you know
what you're going to see what happened
to my face at the end of the video and
then how I deal with it so guys I hope
you enjoyed this video and I'll see you
later bye so firstly I'm gonna go in and
I'm gonna do my brows and this is the
brow satin it's a duo brow brush and I
love the fact that it is a swirly tip
can you all see that
that looks nice okay come through on
this end team to be some kind of squidgy
blend and I think it wants to give you
like supermodel blended brows I'm not
mad at that I really like the size it's
really nice and thin oh there's a little
bit of an eyebrow hair coming out but I
feel like you can get really natural
looking brows of this and the pencils
are really good color the color I got
was dark brown eye let's try this let's
see what difference this makes softening
it cute doesn't do very much next I have
the illuminating highlighting concealer
this color is called sand this is the
darkest color that I saw and it's got I
love this tip this is a really nice way
to keep the concealer and make sure that
it doesn't dry out but this is up okay
so um sand isn't going to work for my
skin tone right so when I was picking
foundations there were two foundations
that I actually wanted to try this is a
dream velvet this is a color coconut and
it's 95 it's a soft matte how hydrating
foundation and then this is dream matte
I know that this is quite old because I
used to use this in my old-school
YouTube days I'm sure and the color I
have is coop oh that is what the dream
matte mousse looks like it looks like
exactly my skin tone right this is the
dream matte velvet the color is coconut
ah and they have this dream blender so
I'm going to use the dream blender
I've got foundation everywhere people to
blend that matches very nice that
matches like my exact skin tone I like
to wear foundations that are kind of a
bit more yellow and a bit more saturate
and if that makes any sense but this is
very similar to my natural skin tone
this brush is really weird because it's
not porous so the foundation kind of
sits on it it doesn't kind of blend in
maybe it'll be nice if I wet it here's
my foundation side here's my nose
foundation side so you can see a little
bit of discoloration let us go ahead and
use the dream matte mousse on the other
side and I'm just going to dip this in
this looks like chocolate oh God
blends nicely that blends nicer than
that side it's a lot thicker so the
colors to me I like virtually the same
very very similar
this one's letting a little bit more
moisture through to this side it looks
it looks matte but there's a little bit
of jus this side is in anything through
like not are highly no that's literally
my exact forehead color and with this
brush it feels like all the product is
getting into your skin like none of the
product is being wasted on here it's
just going all the way onto your skin I
actually really like this thingamabob
now for me right now my face is looking
all too kind of one tone so I'm going to
go ahead with my concealer we just bring
some like right to my face mixing and
blending
no one's faces one toe alright so I
picked up a face powder and this is the
long wear matte powder which is also
waterproof you probably
see it but we'll film it this is in
color 40 and fawn in a drugstore this
was the darkest color I could find and
the swatch look like it was alright but
on here it looks a bit pasty this powder
is not it no this powder is very white
it's very pink
it's very salmony right no it's very
cold but it's really mattifying I feel
like if you're pink
you've got pink undertones this could be
very good like I don't need to bake I
can just apply this so I feel like the
powder is too cold for me probably if
there was another color I could have
found maybe they have another color it
would be nice but overall it's not bad
and it's really really mattifying like
really matter frying so these are the 24
hour color tattoos
I saw loads of different colors I
decided to go for gold cuz I'm gonna do
a red lid this color is called eternal
gold it looked really rich and just
stunning
like I hope you could see this is just a
really rich gold and I love the way it
feels I'm just going to use my finger to
apply wow pigment come all the way
through I'm just going to use it applied
better like this this gold is so so gold
I think my camera just stopped but I was
saying that this is absolutely stunning
like I'm in love with this and the
reason why I love doing videos like this
it's because I'm trying stuff out I
wouldn't normally try out and I'm like
you know what this gold this line art
there in my collection they're really
good loving it yeah it goes on like a
dream I mean I think eibon's I've been
sleeping on these because I always use
liquid liner this just looks so jet
black and just graphic and just just wow
oh love love love love love love next I
have the falsies pushup drama mascara I
believe I've actually used this before
and remember it being quite good but I
know
like the mascara there's loads of
product in here it's got that nice pop
sound it's giving me lashes Campu really
like that mascara my face is lacking all
forms of highlight and contour and
structure it just needs everything right
now and this is the master sculpt the
color I have is medium dark because in
the store that was the only one I could
get and have a feeling there's like a
dark like a dark dog and but I couldn't
find that but I was like you know let me
see the medium dark let's see what it
looks like
on so it looks great when they when
someone says that makeup can make them
look ashy this is the exact example so
though it's dark it's very grey on my
skintone so if I put that on my face it
honest not let's going so it's meant to
contour it actually looks like reverse
contouring it literally it's very great
you know I'm just going to go for the
dark brown on my shade and light palette
to contour now all I need is a bit of
highlight that is what it's lacking some
light so this is actually a brick
bronzer but I realize that the color on
this could be really good just to add
some more color and warmth to my face
and also to highlight and this one says
oh one foot blonde so it's kind of light
yo wow wow wow this makes me look
expensive but I love this is not a
highlighter this is actually a bronzer
for lighter skin so for blondes where
this comes out is a really nice
highlight on me I'm using just this side
just use it on my look I'm just going
slightly hand people slightly home cuz
I'm in love with it it looks like I
didn't pick up a blush and I remember
the reason why the reason why was
because it was all empty so I was like
I'm gonna go red because I've got the
cloud and there's this super stay
24-hour color and then there's a vivid
matte lip
quit so I'm gonna try the vivid matte
liquid and this seems like more like an
orange road so number one the color
doesn't really suit me
fair enough the color is not my color
anyway the weird thing for me is that it
says vivid matte liquid and this is
definitely definitely not matte and I
don't know it's slightly opaque so it
kind of looks like you can see my
natural lip color coming through but I
don't know I'm not I'm not feeling the
lip so I'm gonna try this one instead
this is more of a rosy blue or red so
like I've got to put a lot of layers on
to get a really nice thick coverage but
it's a really nice color it feels really
nice on my lips it's not a thick red
it's not like a really vivid red or
vivid color it's cute though it's cute
okay guys that is my one brand face
drugstore - and using Maybelline product
overall I really love the gel liner the
gold eyeshadow is just stunning and
actually the 24-hour and super stain lip
color has settled into something I
actually really liked and would wear on
a regular basis the brick that I used to
highlight which is actually a bronzer
for lighter skin girls fabulous fabulous
fabulous and unfortunately I didn't have
a blush and the blushes were out of
stock the foundation colors definitely
matched for my skin tone but I had the
darkest shades in the store concealer
was just unfortunate maybe it was the
store I don't know but it was just pasty
overall that is my drugstore face and I
wanted to just show that obviously you
can create full glam looks also with
drugstore products but there are
definitely some pros and cons like
specifically for finding the right
product that you want and also slight
color saturation things that you can't
necessarily find in drugstore brands so
there are any other drugstore full faces
you want me to do please let me know in
the comments I've really really really
enjoyed doing this I'll be drugstore -
in for a long time so guys thank you so
much for watching make sure you

what I forgot to do I forgot to split
