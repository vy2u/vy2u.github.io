this it's got a seam right down the
middle and a bag hi I've arrived
advantage first hello beautiful people
welcome to my channel I hope you are
doing well today I am I hurt my breasts
aren't on xocai they're not I feel good
today I'm excited as I always am and
today I spent some money on website that
you may or may not know and it is cool
Jim sharp Jim sure so Jim shock is
basically an online gym where Brad and I
see it absolutely everywhere all of that
instagramers and influences are into
health and fitness they all wear gym
shot and basically you see all these
booties popping with like an actual peak
and literally smashed right down the
crack it's actually that d and whenever
the guys are wearing their squatting and
I feel like you can almost see their
internal organs like wow it's really
that deep and I mean it's really the one
known brand when it comes to light
fitness wear so I was like what I'm
gonna buy some fitness gear I should do
a nice bin R and see what we could find
on Jim shark is it worth a hive is it
worthwhile coin so we're gonna get into
it but I wanted to give you guys a
little rundown of my experience on the
website the first thing I feel like
after says I feel like it was expensive
I ended up spending 429 pounds this is a
lot of money you know it's a lot of
money on gym where realistically I've
got resolution of saving so how I'm
spending six hundred pound on gym where
I don't know I'm really asking myself
the question and yet it I find it to be
expensive for me to buy basically a pant
and a bra that's what it is all right
I'm looking at you know 28 pounds for a
crop top and 30 35 pounds 38 pounds for
leggings where honestly where so yeah I
just bought a whole load of stuff just
to see what looks good and what I think
is really really suitable for me and
what I will save like the website was
really nice it's really simple there
isn't too many products which I really
like I hate when you're like overwhelm
with products so I feel like I've talked
a lot we're about to see me in my gym
wet and you're not so annoying I swear I
always do these videos when I've just
eaten lunch I've had a chocolate biscuit
and everything so I'm gonna just suck in
you see me beer belly
you've seen me flat belly you seen it
all so let's get comfortable let's watch
this video if you're not subscribed
subscribe to notifications on and yeah
let's get started
okay so currently going through the bag
in it's actually really nice the
packaging is very beautiful it actually
flows relatively expensive oh whoa
one of those okay these are extra small
oh my gosh this is lychee
what kind of what kind of ass will fit
into that look at the size of that itchy
is my butt meant to fit into that little
crevice they call their that lychee
looks like the size of a fist okay this
one I was able to find the max in top
the quality is very nice this isn't like
some of the other gym where I have this
is very different okay oh this looks
like slightly orthopedic so there's a
lot of body on show right now guys I am
sucking in 4d in life this is what this
looks like on Friday enough these are
extra small right but they don't feel
extra small they're not actually that
tight if anything they feel bit big not
around here but like there's a lot of
extra material at the bottom and for me
it's important to see what does this
look like on normal girls bodies because
I feel like obviously if you look at
goes I'm not saying that their bodies
aren't normal but say someone who works
out 18,000 times a week like then I'm
gonna look the way I look you know I've
got several rolls around here oh my gosh
this is a lot of fat you know what for
me that much ranch is more than you
could ever possibly need I'm gonna start
with my lego friend cuz I would never go
to the gym it'd be like
hi however it's really nice it's really
stretchy it's really well fitting
somehow already got makeup on it um
luckily I like it and this top is in a
small definitely doesn't look how you
know those gauzy like stand like this I
don't know how they do it
they're like I don't know I don't know
what they do but how do I go to the gym
just just be like hi I've arrived if it
comes first but it's not it's not a bad
kick like the leggings are really nice I
like the detailing there you know it's a
little bit cute I just felt very exposed
feel very exposed and you know I've got
to do I've got to do the squat test
because that's why I feel like I always
see people like like like this Tim
they're always showing how much he live
and normally you see their internal
organs if I do my lift if I do you mind
deadlifts yeah never sexy don't if that
was deadlifting next up is of the Lord
I'm actually concerned this is the flex
leg in woof this is cute this is like
your classic little gym top I have gym
tops that are similar to these so this I
think is 32 pounds as well these are
very low very very low why but from the
back I actually think they look nicer
than the others and they were really
really comfortable but we've just got
way too much patricia's very own show I
don't like this yeah I do not bring my
baby out like this just for you guys on
YouTube
no not gonna lie I love the top I just
wish the bottoms were higher I just
don't like all of this bit being with
show for me personally and they were
like this it's not like you can pull
them up so that you can be like oh if
you hold them like that that would
actually just be wrong that's not how
they're meant to be worn I will say it's
a very very very nice quality and I feel
like my boobs look great in the top oh
okay this is a pullover this is made of
some random fabric I can't tell you what
this is made of I mean if you really
want it to be about the branding life
yeah I can understand what you like well
one of these I feel like I'm in business
in this I feel like I look like a
personal trainer I look like a member of
gym staff because this looks very gym
staff esque oh these leggings they feel
really good on but yeah I feel like a PE
teacher PE teacher PE teachers always
wear these oh this is super cute this is
right up my street I think I'm gonna be
nipples to the wind though my nipples
like to come out and say hi and there's
no padding in this so I'm gonna have to
wear bra let's see I think I've got some
matching bottoms okay
oh they're cropped they like cycling
shorts okay let's see what these look
like as a pair okay laughs the way the
t-shirt looks I don't you think it's
really really nice this like lowrider
legging style I'm not a fan of I don't
like it the top though is a great
alternative if you're not if you're not
wanting to like literally always have
you know your boobs or show your arms on
show love it but this no I do think when
you bend over and stuff though they
won't drop down that you can bend down
and lunge and all that jazz in comfort
lucky not for me I've got some dragon
bottoms I'm hoping that I can put these
on I believe these are 35 pounds there
might be more our double check yeah
let's try these on I mean for me right
it's nice and I can tell there's a lot
of effort that's gone into these it's
not just like oh we've just put some
joggers with
sharkon it it's not like that and like
these are zip pockets it's not normal
sweat material it's kind of a bit softer
I just don't understand why the pricing
is the pricing that I need but in the
same graph I do understand it because
it's actually quite cool it it's quite
good quality these are a nice shape
though that you've come in really nicely
this is my favorite piece though I love
this I need to find make appropriate
leggings to wear and I actually do feel
like I get boobs support like this
genuine boobs are cool they're not like
floating around nipples are to the wind
but not bad at all but these they're
nice just not necessarily worth the
price so these are another set of sweat
but these have the gym shot band on it
they're not really an accent they're a
much thicker sweat material it's got the
zip pockets and everything it's got this
little bit of stitching down the side
they are kind of cute
I feel like actually warming I'm like I
can understand why someone would wear
this is like just their normal clothing
because it you could actually do the
back here with this let us see what this
looks like on you know what I spoke too
soon this knit Sheila's like I've got
two fat Fanny it's got a seam right down
the middle and a bag it just looks small
right in the middle
I was gonna say like I can imagine what
if someone is like a fitness put oh my
gosh look at these look at these if
someone was a like Fitness person a like
you know what I'm just gonna wear gym
wear for my whole life like I can
totally imagine why someone might do
that they're really comfortable these
are like the winter the winter joggers I
actually think it might even be a bit
bleak for me they're not really my style
and then I've got a fat Fanny and na oh
I saw this I feel like this was my
favorite thing cuz I might if I'm gonna
go to the gym I want to look comfortable
and I really want to draw attention to
my crack and that kind of stuff so this
was like a really nice matching set that
I saw which was like a duck sweat set
but quite light sweat so let's see what
this looks like on okay so this is this
set on which is my favorite set of all
because I feel the most comfortable and
calm
nice this is so mean like I'm not really
trying to do the most at the gym it's
very very breathable I don't know what
this is made out of but it's gorgeous
it feels so nice on got the zip pockets
again amazing for putting my phone in
and stuff like that my headphones I like
the way that this is slightly cropped
and loose and I would have to wear a
sports bar of course underneath it but
to me this is this is what I would love
to wear to gym it's my favorite out of
all of it and I just really boring hmm
but yeah I'm gonna give you guys my
final thoughts okay guys that is a me
done trying on some goodies from gym
shot my final thoughts are do you know
what the quality of the product is
actually quite good bearing in mind that
I am NOT a gym wear aficionado I don't
you know I don't wear specialist gym kit
normally I just about where my key or a
DDoS and usually I get my gym kit which
has old Michael clothes or old clothing
or leggings and Primark so definitely I
can tell the difference that the quality
is a lot nicer than some of the stuff
that I've picked up you know on other
websites who don't necessarily
specialize in gym wear but that being
the case at the end of the day like the
gym way that I do have gets the stuff
done but you know I do hate when like
the leggings like they kind of fall down
or it just isn't fitting I'm not getting
as much support as I would like in the
boobie region so I do feel like it was
really good and it's made for that I
just know that that price is a lot I
think it cost a lot of money and
spending 38 pounds or 32 pounds on just
like leggings just because they get worn
at the gym like you know but I would
definitely recommend it if you've got
some money or if you wanted to buy like
your your like your special gym care I
would there's definitely item say I'm
like yes I will have this as my like
nice special gym care if I want to be
extra nice I'm going to a course I wanna
look and feel good then definitely I
would buy em Jim sharp stuff but I know
that the price would is kind of
off-putting for me personally but I know
people buy new lemons and you know Nike
in comparison actually isn't cheaper it
is a more expensive
Nike which I have JIT Nike gym wear and
added a streamer as well so actually
it's reasonable in comparison to those
items so yeah not bad at all not a
scammer all yeah so guys that is it for
me in the meantime I will catch you in
my next video
yeah have a lovely day bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
