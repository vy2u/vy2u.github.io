channel today we have another I spent
the video and if you guys know much like
these videos I just want to make your
buying decisions a little bit easier I
haven't done this for me I'm doing this
for you that is what I tell myself every
time I click buy on that shopping cart
this isn't for me this isn't about me
this is about you I'm today we spent
some money and we have gone to me got it
so yeah I've spent some money on this
committed and I spent a lot of money
because I wanted to review their new in
for autumn collection autumn is here and
I just wanted to see what they had and
it should be honest of you we all know
nobody means this many kind of thing
okay we're just like to see what's new
what's poppin what's going on and I do
these videos realistically for myself
but also so that you guys can see what's
out there because we all know what it's
like when you go out and you purchase
some items the dreams and visions look
one way on the website and when you
receive them you look like a toner and
you just look off kicking you wonder
what's going on and it's been a while
I'm not gonna lie it's been a hot minute
since I've spent any money on misguided
and I'll be honest with you misguided
was one of the first websites winners
coming out with all the kind of cheap
art online fashion stores for like the
body con dresses and all that kind of
stuff they were the early originators
and then I feel like their shine is
slightly being stolen by like the likes
of boohoo and pretty little things and
no poorly and all these websites that
are coming out that kind of look like
they're all doing the same thing and I
know it kind of looks like misguided is
a bit more expensive and I will say I do
feel like sometimes the quality's better
on this guy did but it does vary here
I've got some great stuff from them in
the past and some not-so-great stuff
from there in the past so I thought oh
it's so heavy
this bag is so heavy I pop it look at
this good these teeth and these girls
look at this bad this is all the yummy
thing that came people what I conduct it
up when your boredom is so loud it we're
not water is so large for misguided they
also send you at Bob so this is what
came from my shoulder because I also
bought shoes with just being extra I
wanted to destroy what have they got for
fall what they got for water
what what's poppin what's good so I
basically spent an eye-watering
well-fastened oh wow wow wow I got
carried away I just put everything for
autumn in my basket and then I was able
to get a discount of 64 pounds because I
used a code which was called dress up so
sometimes on the website there are codes
and that code was to get 30% off dresses
if I have my student discount or
something I think I could have also got
that code on top and then my grand total
was 952 so but let me give you guys
quick rundown off the website for those
of you don't know about mr. I did number
one it's a British website I think
they're based in Manchester but they
aren't global and they ship
internationally Next Day Delivery is on
point the delivery is free however the
returns and if I end up returning some
of the items which I probably will and
will decide if I'm mad with them or not
at the end it's gonna cost any money to
return the items and I don't know how
much that's going to cost that box is
heavy AF so yeah and the pricing again
it's definitely quite an affordable
pricing structure however their prices
are a little bit more expensive than
some of those other websites and all
that jazz so yeah I think I've said
everything I'm gonna give you my friend
and thoughts at the end but we're about
to get into it because
this clothing is a lot it's all right so
this dress is called the exaggerated
body con something dress and got it in a
size 10 this is not exactly rated
shoulder this is literally spikes on my
shoulders what the hell is this it looks
so nice and like you know fashionable on
the website and here I can sure I like a
crisp packet I think I could call them a
prick curse back in the fat was not to
start off the video of just throwing out
insults how's the dress gonna look like
this
what the heck yeah yum yum yum she could
shoot someone this is doing the most I
thought I could be cool enough to wear
this and the motto is back in she lost
banging in this I on the other hand I
literally look like push that I don't
mind sharp shoulders but these which one
will literally take your eye out
these are daggers without the bra it
looks okay medium the shoulders on the
other hand are doing the most a much
more prominent here then they look on
the side literally but why my way to it
you have to be confidence and walking
like there's like robot just copied it I
do like no okay this chump it is
God this is an oversized jumper and it's
got like extra long sleeves I personally
love jumpers but I prefer them with the
v-neck where am i screaming the chi waan
my screaming girls like a it's cute it's
really cute I love it obviously other
sides it's still very trendy for autumn
you want to be warmer and the receipts
rent which is literally the current
trendiest color on earth and I feel like
I look good in red I love it it's really
really really oversized look at that
super oversized and you guys know my
main issues that everything comes up to
here on me this doesn't this is a really
nice lounge cute jumper the kind of
jumper is 22 pounds well I mean it's not
cheap as much you've jump up or I would
pay 22 pounds of this this is cute
I feel like this is really nice for
back-to-school as well actually for
those of you who are thinking about that
just put in some leggings putting your
jumper you're good to go your name
okay so they've got this collaboration
with Barbie and I was a little bit like
why are you collaboration with Barbie
but I did see some nice items number one
is the Bobby hoodie this hoodie is 30
pounds no I'm actually offended because
this hoodie is not the same material as
that jumper is it because you've written
Barbie on it
Wow okay so here is the Barbie hoodie on
me bring it in a little vacay so this is
the Bobby hoodie on it's cute I love the
crop on it and everything for 30 pounds
by 5 pounds is a lot especially because
I just warned that jumper that is 22
pounds and is a lot thicker than this
and this is this is half the jump up
this is half a jumper so you're actually
brain the Barbie name is branding and it
also has like matching jogging bottoms
which are really cute I didn't actually
buy them I thought I did but I didn't
it's a cute little crop Cordy not going
to say it isn't a cute little copper D
it is you know there's something about
getting a crop like this that will make
you just look snatched even if you're
not
it's for half the material Wow
okay so next up was this jacket missin I
saw this jacket and I knew it was going
to be in Bangor I'm hoping it will be it
was 60 pounds it's expensive but it's
made of what's this material called it's
Borg I don't know what what vog actually
is well I like it
listen I knew it would be cute I knew
it'd be cute I mean again 60 pounds for
half a jacket though this is half a
jacket but it's really really nice
it's got like firmness on the inside I
hope you guys can see that's got
throwing us on the inside and I just
love the shape and just love the color I
just love everything about this this is
my kind of jacket again a slightly
longer sleeve slightly cropped I put
links in the description bar below but
how cute is this a yeah I love this
jacket I think it's so cute so next up I
brought some trousers and these were new
in and I still got wedding season so I
was thinking would I be elaborate and
wear these to wedding these are 35
pounds and I thought they were doing a
lot by still thought they were kind of
cute I would rock these you know I mean
I don't know what to tell you
I do I like them I thought like I do
like them you know it's one of those
ones where you're like hmm is this a
look I can actually make work if you're
found that but you can't dance this can
give you the illusion of being able to
move Saxony because it does all the
movement for you I don't even make them
you know well is it right so next up I
have this jumpsuit here oh it's cute
I'm not sure about this color on me
though sometimes when I put a certain
shade of green against me I'm looking
like literally I look gray it's cute
it's a flare jung-soo yeah let's put it
on this cou like
because I came to sleep okay too smooth
yeah I feel like just this is my kind of
stuff it's kind of like elevated sexy
you know I say that I'm bougie I'm a
bougie spots like this is like bougie
thought hey um look in see that's kind
of dental camera but in real life it
that's all right it's looking kind of
nice I think I should have got this in
one size smaller this slightly too large
to me I love love the legroom is she's
screaming at you guys because of how
much I love it
but obviously the crotch is slightly
like too low so we've got a slight
hanging penis section just around here
and it just nice I just need to get the
smaller size the boobage area is a lot
again the thing I find with misguided
the V is so low so unnecessary you do
not need to literacy the top of my
vagina from my grass is actually doing
the most it needs to be like this I'm
just like but it's cute though oh this
is giving me bougie spot on 10 pushes up
on 10 okay so this is 35 pounds I think
this is a really good price for this um
John suit and kind of a little bit my
Catwoman in this life okay so this dress
was part of their back-to-school
collection if you're wearing this to
school
listen we need to reflect and go read
your books however this dress was 15
pounds 15 pounds its ruched or down the
side it's cute let me darken it so you
can see the ruching do don't if you guys
can see all of that like detail there
again I think this is really good in
terms of you know just covering up the
stuff that isn't amazing on your belly
it's a really nice shape I feel like my
bum is disappearing like my need to get
back to the gym again I would not advise
wearing this to school
do not wear this to school okay next up
I picked up some pinstriped trousers I
thought the
nice work these are 35 pounds and
they're not cheap let's try these on and
then I also got a pinstripe jacket
okay okay so I'm trying to decide if I
like these or not before I put my hands
in the pocket
I felt like I looked back who was
standing inside a paper bag and I just
look like a person in a sack but when
it's like tight and everything it
actually looks okay I'm actually going
to work
I would totally up hundred percent wear
these actually fit they're quite cool
actually see when I've got my hands in
my pockets and they little vest and a
little lean I look oh so chic and like
work chic but then if you just stand
like like a normal person you kind of
just look the potato potato cheap okay
so here's the blazer on and I love the
place that I love the way it looks with
the leggings it's really cute I feel
like it's one where you would roll the
sleeves up put your hands in some
pockets and just be really cool the only
thing is that the price is 50 pounds I
think that's really expensive for this
jacket but it looks really nice of this
best it's slightly over price but I like
it I'm here and we're there so next up
is something I was really really looking
forward to I mean I think these are
going to be ones that you have to try on
before you really know so if you guys
have been front of me for long enough
you guys know I love leather trousers
I live for number charles's these are 40
pounds and I thought they look really
cool but somehow I put in person they're
giving me Edward Scissorhands ice okay
so these are these trousers on man this
is me making a choice that's a little
bit much and the thing is is that
there's slightly a bit it will fit you
but my boot is slightly poppin on the
back it looks so right but at the front
here and nichy got a baggy fanny
I hate when trousers do that it's either
because they're too big in one area and
too small in another but these are
really tight on my thighs but I really
loose here I mean for 40 pounds when
to get this you need to get this right
come on somebody's got to be right about
this right so I've got this slouchy Nik
jumper which looks really cute nice
sleeves and everything autumn obviously
is the time for knit this has a weird
smell all of a sudden that's weird
okay so this is this jumper on oh okay
that's cute
I didn't realize how open back it was
it's really open back I love the way it
drops at the front and everything I
think it's actually quite cute I like
that but I don't think it's a bad jumper
and I love the back but your kidneys are
definitely gonna get cold in this but
who needs kidneys Hey okay I don't
leather Matt in autumn like I don't let
the mad I've always been leather mad and
so this dress it is that this is not
leather this is what this is that
obvious pleather and it's literally
glistening like the Sun literally bin
line up why why is it so shiny
solutely glistening I mean I guess
that's a look this is a one-shoulder
dress it's 30 pounds I got it in the
size 10 it looks cute on the model and I
have a little fetish for Len now so
we're just gonna rock it we're gonna see
how this looks like it is just extremely
reflective but let's see hey this is
this dress on now it looks like I try to
customize a bin liner but like it's I've
done a good job I quite like it I feel
like I can walk into the room like this
is very 19 this is an extremely 19th
something about the bow and like the way
it's cut I think it's nice I think it's
actually cute this is it's even two of
them I look you in it I don't know I
like this I just not anywhere to read
this to what am I going where am I going
maybe I bring this one right out you
know a girls night out it's given me
some kind of illusion here you don't
nice I've got them gained in a small
side hippie I'm gaining a little
additional kava trouble because of the
shine hey come on
oh I was dissing the bin liner out of
the VAT I bar even here what it looks
good doesn't it mm-hmm okay coming back
to some casual lots some mum jeans these
are twenty two pounds and a little crop
top again 20 pounds okay so the first
thing I've gotta say is these mom jeans
actually look like your mom's jeans with
nobody out she wants
they look like drainpipes the it's just
all wrong this is not a good fit mom
Jean where do they think that this is
how one jeans are meant to look now when
you want mom jeans to look flattering
these don't look at this little glasses
no it's a smile look it doesn't look
great man
imagine going to have to censor just put
a sensor on this where where are you
going maybe it's me maybe I'm a grandma
by the way I've got nipple covers on by
the way okay I've got nipple covers on
but why is the clothing so wide I just
want to wear a top to school or to work
why are all my breasts out of all of
doors it just needs to be here yeah and
it needs to be here I don't mind showing
a little cleavage but when you can
literally see your milk ducts is doing
the most no it's not everyday milk dots
you don't need to see everything
actually I'm so over it I'm so tired of
it
listen I'm just going to put sensor like
sensors here because wow and the shot
isn't my shirt like I love the shape of
the shirt I love the sleeves I love what
it's doing but explain to me why half of
the shy is missing and it put Patricia's
on one today today is not the day today
not the day okay so I've got this open
back I swear the back is
since season right about now and I'm
living for it honey you're living I love
this jumper I love the color for me
finally the right shade of brown to wear
is very difficult because sometimes I
just look like just it's not a good look
I'm brown so the shade of brown has to
elevate me not DD elevate me and have me
looking like sand disapear enacting sand
it's not a good look but this is a
really nice shade of brown this I love
the jumper
I love the sleeve low the back is cute
like I loved I love jumpers this this
high because I'm just over Dan over crop
I'm over ice having crop all the way up
to our little underboob but I'm still
here for crop all the way over here
another key jump are basically autumn
for me is just cute jumpers a little bit
of a V this is great look at the detail
there it's cute it's a v-neck it isn't
open but so for those of you who don't
want to have your back on show it's
lovely it's that got that my shape as
well but I really like however it's 28
pounds so I do think it's a little bit
pricey it's really comfortable I love it
I love it this is me they said oh kind
of top I will wear one like an everyday
basis next up I have this
off-the-shoulder
satin top obviously green and right oh
this is cute this is nicer than I
thought it was gonna be this is lovely
I was just criticizing crop however this
is back to the crop again no but how
cute is this
this is can give me real oh wow wow wow
yes
wow wow by being in it you in you in you
oh my gosh I love it
however this is a petite and this is a
size 10
this is huge on me I don't know what's
up with the sizing if you're a petite
girl you're gonna need lychee size four
because this is big and this is a size
10 petite but it's cute me then I can do
my mom dance this is what my mom thinks
she looks good yeah she's like look me
look me that you have my our feet and
then she stand with her hands like this
my out feet okay clearly for this autumn
season I've gone ham of green it's
become my thing what is this this is a
what is this okay it's a jumpsuit oh
this is just bougie this isn't even
thought this is just bougie but covered
up on the top we have a little bit of
Thai to hide the lunch baby and my booty
looks smashed
do you not wanna eat this when you get
that little bit it's a it's not an
entire wedge it's coming out from my lid
wedgie when you get that listen the game
is change is over and love the open back
I thought that you could wear this to
work you know if you want to be that
woman he comes in my climbing business
my current i watch suits a lot do you
guys watch suits if any of you guys
watch suits Jessica's my favorite and I
feel like Jessica would actually wear
this to work she's coming with some
slayin jumpsuit and her briefcase and
then just you know attack a case and you
watch see let me know if you know about
suits you lot look at this this is
illusions being created here see how my
back is coming in and this is this is 25
pounds listen this little bitch Scott is
actually 28 pounds and I think for a
faux leather skirt it's actually quite a
good skirt and I don't think it's too
expensive this is actually like a shark
dress um I'm not really sure this kind
of chewed up by a dog effect we have
going on on the bottom here it's a bit
of a why did we need to do it
I think it's nice diving it I love the
style of it
I think this is definitely very back to
school II put this on with a pair of
jeans or some short and I can little
white vest in the bottom you're good to
go and if you are actually to wear this
as a dress though you're going to look
slightly with but for like an oversized
shirt I think it's nice not all together
though but I do like him so next up is
this suede jacket and you guys know me I
love a biker jacket and I saw this and
have my name written all over it it's
got this detail on it oh it's
cute and it's got lining and it's nice I
feel like I need the smaller size though
I think there's something up with the
sizing or I just lost weight this is a
size 10 I feel like I need the size 8
but really just to cut me the way I need
it to cut me or maybe I should leave it
slightly oversized so that I can put
stuff on underneath but overall again
this is cute and I'm the studying on
there I'll show you another jacket but I
have those very similar this is from
misguided I think this was 40 pounds
this is completely dick this is quite a
thin flimsy light jacket this is a lot
heavier and a lot thicker and probably a
lot warmer like this jacket is one of
those jackets which is for decoration
not for actual wear whereas this one is
actually a bit more warmer mm I have
this dress because I feel like wedding
season is still on so I wanted to see
what this dress looked like it was still
quite pretty and elegant this is Kay I
don't know if it's a bit much for a
wedding though because it's there's a
lot of like openness I think we just
need to just D open it like it should be
so open I love the top and love the way
it crosses over and the skirts really
cute as well oh maybe this is where to
be off the shoulder I don't know if
that's off the shoulder Oh even you okay
I think this is wedding appropriate
yes comfrey shake complete elegant
classy but you know the look in case
you're still looking for a husband at
the wedding this is a nice dress option
and it should feel like auntie Dorothy
this is it's like the black floral
pattern why is it fall on a black this
is literary Doris Doris I've got the tea
although when I lift this up okay we
have something potentially going on but
just down here
with Doris to up here we're action oh
okay how did we just bring that back how
did we just bring that okay so my last
item this shirt I like the way this part
of the shirt sets I love that the arms
are just given me giddy up cowboy just
giddy up cowboy okay next up actually
went ham with Footwear so we got some
items
I mean shoes and my advice and I spend
money on shoes
I like designer shoes so when I catch
shoes that look like this there's
something that just looks like farmer's
shoes on these just everything about
them just give me you're wrong
here are these shoes on and that looking
kind of sexy and if you guys know I
suffer from you I do it if this is the
disorder but my feet are very big for my
size so my goal is always to get shoes
that don't make my feet look gigantic
which is hard when you're 5 foot 4 and
your size 8 inches okay I just got an on
both feet so I always look for shoes
that have an arch that's okay and these
are Q I mean they're not again these are
30 power shoes they're not expensive
shoes but they're quite comfortable and
I like
way this detailing looks this bit looks
a bit like a beak
you know the beak of a bird this is not
a good look right here you don't need to
be beak in it needs to have a little bit
more of a peak to it rather than a beak
but at least I don't feel like my feet
look too big in these let's see this
place do you have a fit what were you
thinking I've got gas maybe it's cuz I'm
thinking about getting some low shoes
everyday shiny shiny shiny these are
these on um
Hugh Hefner with some bling that's what
I'm getting with these do you know I
just notice how there's like crystals
all around the front of the shoe that is
doing the uttermost you are actually
doing the most
there's crystals all on the front and
just on the back heel um yeah I'm just
gonna say it's a no okay glass pad oh I
remember I picked this pair the other
very light so these are obviously a take
on the Stella McCartney pair made of
this is not actually wood here and this
is made of some kind of styrofoam but
I'm not mad at this actually I'm not mad
I've been they look actually better here
then they look on the website I think
yeah alright babe thank you
what you can't tell me anything in these
I didn't expect to like these you know
these are so nice these are 25 pounds
for the knockoff pair or seller
McCartney's these are comfortable as
well I can't believe it I think they're
really nice like then I'm a bit shiny
I'm not gonna lie but I like them I
think they're cute so I'm done with miss
Guardian I feel like that this it is
about to be long a F as per usual and my
overall thoughts are this is that there
were some good items there are some good
items I think that the quality is
actually very good or misguided I never
felt like something felt cheap or thin
or whatever I do
the quantity is good I think they're
lacking in the workwear Department I
think definitely a lot more could be
done there and much of you could be
buying work we're from misguided you'll
be set but yeah there's low prices
there's high prices there's a little bit
of everything on misguided and it's a
sight that I actually genuinely trust
and would go to shop on regularly so go
misguided I've got links in the
description bar below to everything I
tried on so if you wanna you know
purchase some items you can do so and
then I was going to say I'm going to be
doing a giveaway almost every video for
this month and I live insert pictures of
what I have or some video clips but I
just want you to be follow me on my
Instagram and on my snapchat and on my
Twitter give this video a thumbs up as
well leave a comment look in that sink
of reviewing shoes I think I'm gonna do
a shoe video next so there any shoe
sites that you want to see let me know
