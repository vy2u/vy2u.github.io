present

a little bit of a deep breath before I
tell you what had happened with me
spending some money on a sauce I had a
little bit of a kind of closet clearing
out major like just getting rid of my
old clothes and I haven't had a big okay
I know this evening you have a clearer
you need to spend some more money to get
some new goodies so I've ended up going
on to when my old school favorite sites
which is days off and I have asked us
girls girls and boys yeah but I spent
some money but right it's been a while
like I haven't done an I spent a video
for quite a while if I'm gonna spend my
money and a happy to spend it on a this
cuz I'm quite confident that you know
I'm gonna get some goodies we're gonna
see what I have in there gonna try it
out also what I wanted to let you know
is that this is the start of breitler we
have breakfast which hopefully is gonna
make your day a little bit brighter in
the need up to Christmas I really want
to help you guys with your shopping
decisions I'm gonna have a vlog every
single week Learner people love vlogs as
well we're gonna be shopping we're gonna
be bougie we're gonna be budget we're
gonna be we're gonna be doing all of it
so get ready and also I don't know when
this video is going out hopefully this
is the day before Black Friday listen
get your pen and paper ready
look at my description bar below if I
can find coupon codes and discounts I
will have them down below
you need to bookmark good these if
there's anything you see that you like
bookmark it because by the time Black
Friday comes you don't have to be like
oh it's sold out I can't find that item
no save it to a little bookmark cuz I
know a lot of people they like to do
their Christmas shopping or if they're
gonna have it close it clear out they're
gonna do it now because listen if you
can get 30% off for 40% off why would
you not do it doesn't make no sense so I
feel like I need to just show you the
levels
the levels or not I can't even lift the
up this this is the levels yeah it's
ringing a lot when you spend some money
on days off I spent in total I think
I've got one thousand four hundred and
seven pounds something along those lines
right I'm out of breath thinking about
it I got everything trainer's bad
clothing I got everything
well let's just talk about the website
so as us
it goes is a website that lots of us
know and love I feel like I'm smiling
because I'm actually genuinely like an
old-school ageless fan but I haven't
shopped on easels for quite a while you
can get lots of different brands on azor
so you can get whistles you can get
misguided you can get boohoo you can get
a ddos 90 you can get almost every
single brand they do free Next Day
Delivery they do easy returns that is
why so many of us I feel like you say
the sides of website I think sometimes
their own stuff is hit or miss so some
is really good quality and some is you
know this just looks you know crappy and
cheap because what I wanted to do was
kind of revamp restock my wardrobe or
after it is now currently dust it's
literally dust like blowing in the wind
fan dry so I thought okay we need to
just add some sass in there I'm gonna be
honest I love ethos because I've always
been a girl whose book who bought stuff
on there and it was one of the first
online sites I ever used when I was like
a university
it used to be could as seen on star like
random 10 pound 20 pound 15 pounder s's
on there was a back street but now it's
like you know we all know it's like
really kosher we love it so let's see
what your girl oh god okay I feel so
excited for this video I don't know why

brightness we will be doing giveaways
and goodies so make sure you are
interactive on my Instagram and on my
Twitter even comments liking I will be

this video okay
there's so many items I'm gonna try and
put like three or four items together at
once almost create you know if
you know we want to look like a snack
like a total look so I'm gonna do that
because we will be here for seven hours
trying on these clothing if not this
video is going to be a good 45 minutes
long so go get yourself a tea and a
slice of cake right now before we get
into it I know what this is this is just
a little black dress its velvet velvet
is very in for this season look at this
this little strappy sleeve how do I
actually get into this piece of rope
right let me see OMG
this dress had all the dream it had all
the vision but it covered none of the
nipple it is one of those dress that you
just breathe on it and as I always say
it's completely nipple to the wind look
how cute it is
I love the chain detail up here I like
look at the asymmetrical leg and
everything how nice does that look I
don't know maybe it's something to do
with the way that the chain is maybe the
chain oh she just broke oh my god you
just snapped you know what all it needs
is that the chain just needs to be
slightly more attached but clearly the
chain has come at me broken so I'm gonna
see what I have to do but actually like
that it looks really nice because I'm
getting coverage and I'm getting side
thigh all good looks but it's not good
looks if I just expose myself to the
entire world
I do like here but I need I need to get
the chain fix curly but that shouldn't
just pop out in you were at dinner and
then all of a sudden your chain popped
in your boobs fell out that wouldn't be
fun what would be fun for whoever
sitting opposite you but yeah okay these
two are Aggie - sometimes I don't know
what is I don't look so good in
sportswear feel like it doesn't
necessarily suit me so let's see why I
look like oh sure this neckline on me I
don't know I look like just a floating
head actually is it alright I don't know
it's not fuck mind I found a pregnant
woman from the 80s something about this
thick just looks I don't know I do like
the leggings though like look at this I
like the leggings I like the velvet I'll
show you guys either some
nice velvet leggings cute and I got the
size 8 I bought 8 and 10 but actually I
quite like the size 8 they fit really
nicely let's see all the cellulite and
jazz I feel like this jumper just makes
me like a potato and I wanted to be
Instagram cool and all that jazz you
know my daddy Dassin that jazz about
like at some moment sound like it
someone was I don't know this is 63
pounds so I probably don't like it as
much so usually price of that the
deciding factor at 63 pounds this can go
back I will keep the leg in there 33
pounds can you see the way that it just
shines shine in okay guys this is so
damn heavy I just picked out the bag I
know why I picked this up this dress was
a hundred and eighty pounds but party
season is in the air and I did kind of
want a dress that really really stood
out and it is heavy I'm excited I saw
this sounds like I've had happen and you
know because I know when I do these
videos you guys end up buying stuff and
then when I want to like change sides or
something it's all sold out that's why I
pick up two for myself just thinking my
gosh good dinner does it clash with my
hair those dresses got me looking like
one Christmas tree you hear it you will
hit me before I walk in yes it's got
tassel this is the nicest thing I've
ever seen your navel you can't wear a
bra with it
how you been to where they're really
see-through oh my no let me scan it with
damaging this dress I need help
it's I stomach little kiss on flat flat
yes Oh Lord we not the beat we lost the
beads not two beads
I've been awards that I'm going to but I
think this dress might be a little bit
too much I just fought to get into this
dress actually took off my bra put a
nipple covers I'll show you my favorite
nipple covers
oh Lord these are my favorite nipple
covers these are Azoff these are really
really really good and they last for
ages now here's this dress on I look
like one glistening you are gold shining
shining soldier I love the military look
it's a little sure I'm not going to like
it's a little short but because it's cut
and stuff on top I feel like I can get
away with it I think it is beautiful
however we have lost like a handful of
beads already and I've just tried the
dress on look at this you can't miss me
this dress I feel like I can hear bees
just falling to the ground and I feel
like that's every pound just fall into
the ground
it's gorgeous I'm not gonna lie is
gorgeous this is one of those it's my
time to shine New Year's Eve I walked up
in the building dresses my stomach looks
like it's on flat flat the curves are
looking good and for me it's this oh
nice wear down I can just hear it going
yes a zorse you tried you really did try
oh wow look at this Wow come on come on
the nurses you know what you have to
create a new dance with this that what
would that move birth if you're stiff
just move your dress and it's the next
up I have joggers I wanted skinny
joggers it's getting cold so these are
the black skinny rockers and then this
is a red sweater I think oh it's petite
it's 35 pounds and these were 18 hello
why I'm picking red items I feel like I
really want red in my wardrobe for some
reason this is very cute oMG so the
trousers I thought these with joggers
they're not jugglers they're just like
news trousers but they're really nice I
like the one I like the jumper you know
it's crazy
I do like communion red it's a little
short but not too short listen we don't
have the teacher giraffe arms coming out
this is actually a petite jumpers I'm
surprised that it fits me so well I love
the detailing and it's a crop jumper but
without being literally crop I see
you're under boobs because for me as
well when I wear crop it has to be loose
crop it can't be just like oh that just
shows every love and every bump like no
it's not necessary but this is nice this
has got a nice fit and then here are the
trousers look they look kind of like
military trousers they really loose but
I can wear my tights or leggings
underneath to stay extra warm they are
they are doing nothing for the booty
like literally
nothing absolutely nothing but these are
more about comfort I love this little
detailing there is one hey I found the
super skinny joggers I was looking for
their kids
these are 18 pounds and then I don't
know why I bought this red bow top like
I'll being wrapped up like a Christmas
present

I feel like you'd wear this off the
living long skirt I can do a long white

don't know who I'm asking to a wrap fee
but well this is just the keeper one
that you need some in your closet anyway
it's actually really nice quani I love

on my violin it's so cute I love this
and then these are the chokers I mean
they're giving me major camel major camp

sports or casual black gizelle trainers
I say casual but the white is just
glistening wow it's very bright very

all black they're very comfortable
though actually they're cute they are
here let me put the other one on oh my
feet looks more shot my feet look minute
shot yes listen for all my negatives
move you know both feet or large feet
the goal is always to never have your
feet looking too big just so you guys
know that I'm not mad I want you to see
the top pair of like a little black
pencil stuff this is actually from a
source as well but yeah you can see how
it would look like this
not with the jogger bottoms and trainers
but with some high heels you just walk
in like a wrapped Christmas
present ready listen it's cuffing season
out here okay get ready this is how you
can't so I bought a couple of jumpers as
well this jumper is nice it's off the
shoulder but feel like you can wear it
like that is well if you want to but it
does this it's really nice it's really
oh something's poking me it's just
attack it's just the tag put this like a
creature or something in it okay and
yeah really like this off the shoulder
level there like fluffy and ruffle
detail on that that is super super cute
it's like knitted and warm but you know
for the gram you take it off the
shoulder you show your clavicle we know
that clavicle is the new cleavage if you
don't have boobies everyone has clavicle
and then you know when it's really cold
you just like no no cover that curve
will come up nicely I really like that
this is will look so nice of the pair up
indigo jeans and some boot yeah I love
that that is the such a me jump up cause
you guys know I love showing a shoulder
you're like baby sick grizzly bear but I
kind of like it it fits so weird I feel
like I look like a bag I love it's not
even oversized it's just be like I've
got a body suit or is it just me this
one I wish you luck were here I said
just explain it to me I need I need help
is this nice or is this not mine I like
the color and it's listen and it's I
need you to see how how soft this is
this is so so soft right now oh yes it
feels so good I just look foxy AF me
boxy berry and baby sing the three bees
like it's an it's an ode a lot of you
guys ask me about where I get my like
crewneck or my square neck tops I get
them from a sauce this is them and I
also bought some joggers and you're like
I want to wear a lot of joggers right
now so let's see what they're looking
like it's lovely
it's super casual and it would be nice
to have this top in the black but I
didn't have it in the white you see how
like square Nekhbet is I love this and
it isn't too low so you don't have to
see all the girl all the time and you
know what for a skinny jogger these are
not bad at all my booty does not look
depressed and I can kind of smack
my waist in it I just you know I need
some really really tie this tight but be
like yeah so now the bottoms look really
cute about casual drug cause I feel like
I just needed some casual drugs that I
wouldn't be embarrassed to wear outside
of the house that's why I got so many
but these these are actually nice it
doesn't look awful it doesn't look
amazing but it doesn't look awful awful
this is a super casual I love this top I
wear it so so much in the black so I was
like you know I'm gonna get the white
one as well okay so I got carried away
with some coats this is 75 pounds is it
shiny is it not shiny let's get it on so
I love oh oh my god this is so cool this
is lit look at this it's 75 pounds but I
don't mind paying for a good winter
jacket that's gonna keep me warm because
my kidneys listen they need warmth this
is so cute
look at the detailing on that it's got
like little faux fur on there all over
the inside and just down the bottom as
well I have to show you guys look so
nice on I actually think 75 pounds is a
bar concealer looks like that I'm zipped
up because you know I'm not gonna be
doing pretend it's warm out here with my
jacket on this yes this is lovely yeah
I'm upset because I think I like
everything so I'm gonna have to work out
how we're gonna what we're taking back
because you can't like everything
because that's a that's money that is
money this is so nice this is really
really really nice like if you are
wanting to find a jacket for the cold
this is an option it's really warm on
the inside I'm impressed and I want this
jacket Israel I thought I'm trying to
not have so much black in my wardrobe
see this is one of these year that this
it gives you false hope it makes you
look at it thinking that oh it's really
warm
it's really cozy I think this is 65
pounds makes you think it's really warm
and cozy but this is as light as a
feather I can't tell me anything in my
multiple textured coat you cannot tell
me anything I love it I love it it can
just be like off shoulder into the
one day we know we're gonna do a video
on this you know Instagram trends our
shoulder it is cold why are your
shoulders owl wear your jacket properly
but still I still do it look at this
beautiful it is beautiful there's no
pockets it's still cute though so this
is the jacket that's more for decoration
that's what my dad say this jacket is
for decoration it's really cold this is
not gonna it's not gonna protect you
okay so I bought this top I don't even
tell what where you get in because I
wanted one of those chainmail tops
without having one of those chainmail
tops because the way my dresser set up
like it's gonna be one exposure to the
wind like no no no what it is I feel
like there's something in there that's
making me be a little bit more thought
what do you know a bit more like oh okay
hello look at this it's cute you know
it's a great alternative to those
chainmail talk tops which are just too
risky for me whereas this one is a risky
we've got some support around the neck
we've got a little bit of back as look
how much of my back is out we don't have
a side too much side boob coming out
we're safe we're secure I just paired
these that you have a pair of jeans out
of my closet I like trying on stuff now
with stuff that I already have in my
closet to see if I can make it work
and this is cute this is more like I
would wear this like New Year's or going
out for drinks with the girlfriends if I
wanted to dress up I don't worry what
but I like it
do you like it would you guys think
it'll take me home to your like mom or
wearing this would you my mum would be
like put it in worried
I completely forgot that I bought a bag
and it looks like amazing it looks
really nice it looks a lot bigger than I
thought it was going to be this is some
skinny dip London look at that that is
really cute
this massive inside nice as that as
gorgeous and it's silver hardware I've
been looking for some silver hardware
stuff does that chain go go know what
you can put an iPad in here your phone
in very very nice I really really like
that go skinny day well this is nice I
like the color this is like a basic wrap
top I hope it's not giving me lactating
mother and the nurse I
that gives me life hating mother about
this let's see what it looks like oh
this is nice it's giving me marginal
lactates and other than that it's just
got this thing and I've been a lactating
mother and it's like you could just
literally get a boob out and feed the
world and it just it gives that vibe
that you could should just kind of
separate it out maybe that's just in my
head but the colors really nice
it's a little too low for my liking but
I could just stitch it up like it needs
to be up here and no I they make
everything so low with the color so so
nice and the fit is really nice and this
is one of those casual tops that I just
reach for every single day with a pair
of jeans like this is what I would be
dressed like 99% of the time so actually
it's a key part because I can just put a
little stitch in there and the color the
color is my color I live for that I
figure that's really nice okay a couple
more Jackie okay so I bought a bomb ah
sure I had a brought I have a long room
bomb I had it last year this is a short
black bomber leave this is 40 pounds or
this is gorgeous this is a very gorgeous
low bomber I love an oversized bomber
like this the shape of this is really
nice I've got make a decision I can't
have every coat I love this I do like
this laughing and this basically orange
do though it's velvet though and is nice
like a beacon that you looking down the
street in my like orange quilt this is a
duvet
you know when it's cold you not care
they have this in black I'll buy I don't
know it's a weird orange shade but the
principle of this jacket is nice I love
it but no it's an it's an herb or
another faux fur jacket you have a
problem okay I have a problem leave me
alone don't judge me no I just got
jacket just slightly but I really like
it I really like this one the arms
aren't so sure this is so nice life is
kushti life is cozy I mean people know I
have an obsession with coats I always
have especially in the winter I have a
whole cupboard dedicated to coats so
it's always been if they have warm
that's all that matters out here arms up
not too sure I've had worse whoops
sixty-five pounds
yeah we can't have all these coats we're
gonna make a decision we'll make a
decision the last three bits this is of
what were you thinking Patricia why is
it green please look like one kind of
the school uniform track pants that you
were embarrassed after we're on sports
day made it look so stylish on the go
she was doing the Leanback Corp she
looked great this is redic let me see
what it looks like God leave a lot as
awful as I thought they'd be on I've got
a little bit of the baggy fanny going on
just a little bit but isn't anything I
can't handle you know it's not it's not
- there's not too much gathering these
need to go home isn't look quite cute
they're not what I thought will they
would be are made of one kind of a yes a
friend of Charles a material of all this
stuff combi that the front which looks
nice so far looks a bit cheap up close
let me try them on anyway what is this
this is like a section for you to enter
like what the hell why is there like a
penis bit right there there is no way to
draw more attention to your nether
regions and creating a landing strip to
go right there why would you do that
wish it was right but the delivery was
so wrong landing strip to the vagina up
Wow this is ridiculous I'm not going up
this is my bombs a pic thank you they're
all wrong they're all wrong this t-shirt
isn't fabulous either look at you
together okay together last two bits I
arm trouser crazy right now peg I'm peg
leg trouser right crazy right now and
then this little beaded top let's see
what it looks like on all this that's
two more like this let's see what a
little bit more shoulder you know this
season let's just call it a shoulder
season we've got some beading some
pearls we got some pearls on the
shoulder area it looks really nice I am
really loving loving loving loving
loving this table I think it looks
really really nice on got a bit of arm
fat and you know I've got this fat
pocket right here it's needs to turn to
tuck it back if it kind of accentuates
that fat pocket but you know what it
doesn't even matter to care that much
but this is really nice how nice is this
trying everything is cool me it's army
last bit these are the last items I
don't know what it is it these kind of
trailers everybody else looks so good in
them a guillotine look like a mess I
like a train wreck
and like a potato sack I just look look
how broad I look and it's like a broad
beam this is so ridiculous
actually actually I think I've spoken to
you these are size ten maybe I need a
smaller size I feel like you guys might
know what I'm trying to get out right
with these kind of trousers and stuff
but I know there's something about them
that just make me look so pretty I'm not
sure I feel like we slightly failed at
the final hurdle but I'm gonna give you
guys my final thoughts now oh my gosh
I'm utterly utterly out of breath right
now
oh my gosh but we're done we spent some
money on the beloved Azar's
and you know I love it I basically love
all of it so we're gonna have to really
do some thinking to work out what's
going back and what is really really
needed in my wardrobe I feel like a this
is one of those places that you can't go
wrong and the things that are more
expensive are basically the designer or
the brand stuff so I'm talking like idly
dance or Nike or whistles that's the
stuff that's more more expensive and of
course they have that dress that had all
the beading on it that was 180 pounds
but that looked to me like it was worth
180 pounds because it was heavy
yeah and it was gorgeous and I'm going
to be wearing that for sure overall I
basically when I came of everything and
I haven't been on a zoe's for probably
about 3 to 4 months probably because
I've been trying all these other shops
you know from across the world and
having some shopping experiences but
it's nice to come back to like you know
an old favorite that tells you well you
