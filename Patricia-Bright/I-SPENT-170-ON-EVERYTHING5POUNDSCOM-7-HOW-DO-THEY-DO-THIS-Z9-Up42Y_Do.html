beautiful people welcome to my channel I
hope you are doing well I'm clearly
holding a bigger box again because we're
about to do one of y'all's requests okay
and multiple of you guys have mentioned
this store to me which I had never heard
of and it could everything 5 pounds now
to my audiences from across the pond hey
for those of you in u.s.a hello and 5
pounds is about $7 so basically let's
just call it everything $7 and basically
it's this website where you can buy
every single item and they are all
priced at 5 pounds now that was kind of
mind-blowing and then I watched the
advert and the adverts got an account of
what this lady's name is that it's got
this legend and she's like this top five
pounds OMG you're not gonna believe this
oMG you're not gonna believe this these
dreams 5 pounds ripped jeans and then it
states in the odd videos that on
everything five pounds calm everything's
5 pounds I thought it was a bit crazy
like how can everything be 5 pounds but
I'm doing a little bit of digging and
doing a little bit of research when it
comes to the website that what it seems
they update daily they have new clothes
on there daily but it isn't actually new
clothes I think basically it is clothes
from other brands I'm not gonna say
which brands I think it is because I'm
not gonna try and get sued but I think
that they get items from other brands
who have got leftover stuff all lines
that they didn't end up selling all that
kind of stuff
and they give it to these people who are
basically wholesalers and having worked
in retail if you don't know I used to
work at owaisi's I worked at Kostal it's
in Selfridges and I know that certain
lines just that you don't sell
everything and you often have loads of
sizes left and I never thought what did
they ever do with that but I have a
feeling that they go to places like this
so I haven't had a look I haven't had a
look at inside this box and because
everything was suck was so cheap 5
pounds I suspect it was hard
large dollar but we can find out how
much I spent my Oh Lord
well it's quite nice it's got pictures
I've never seen pictures on the receipt
before everything five pounds oh we
forgot a bra yes
I think I spent about a hundred and
seventy pounds on the website and I got
a ton of items it came really quick
obviously it's a you code website I
don't know if they ship ship
internationally let me have a little
quick look
oh wow they'd ship in the UK and they
 worldwide who knew that but you
might end up paying some kind of customs
it came really really quickly the site
was really easy to use none of it was
all like coordinating but the models
look nice and you know it was a tidy
website and I'll be honest with you like
when I see five pounds as much as I do
these that she in and all these websites
I prefer highly quality items that cost
a little bit more and but you never know
listen if I find a bug in I will wear it
and if it was five pounds up yet yes
girl
that was five pounds I'm the first
person to tell you if I go for a bargain
trust me so yeah I'm excited let's see
what we have in this book the good thing
is I don't have to keep looking at the
prices because guess what five pounds
this is millennium - - is Tesco clothing
if you don't know that I might be
exposing brands right now am I allowed
to do this I'm doing a gonna do it
anyway whatever oh oh this is a nice
little summer like fur me piece yes come
on you guys see the detail it's kind of
like cute and like fluffy minutes quite
simple it is quite simple it's not it's
nothing really special but I like it
like like this like an all-black outfit
and might even wear this today this is
very me with it all happen let me show
you with that one
yes cowboy cowboy realness cowboy
illness this is - okay this is a you are
gold okay this is a little tassel skirt
it doesn't look great doesn't look great

holiday number look at that doo doo doo
dude whoa come on that isn't a bad skirt
although we say look at that yes
movement knife movement yes I'm just
going to stand here doing this I love
the stuff I think it's nice and guess
what it's five pounds oh oh that's cute
can you guys see that it's kind of like
a mesh see-through like little biker
jacket Lee code four I don't know what
that is let's try this on this is giving
me very much over like at Ivy Park vibe
this isn't bad at all
look at that it's really really nice I
like the colors I like the detail I like
the feel that that's really cute and see
the thing is though is that there might
be one or two sizes of an item but there
won't be loads of them so it's almost
like you go one time we find that out in
one time but you might not be able to
find it again but that's really cute
right what is this every single label on
it is a different label this is give me
grandma Doris grandma Doris on holiday
I hate these I literally hate these why
do they put these on clothing you know
this is Oh am I in this on camera I'm
not hating it but maybe that means I'm
turning into a grandma Doris I would
just chill out in something like this
especially at home and something like
this but I never want to be this woman
but I kind of like it so bad it's but it
isn't something fancy these items are
quite casual you know I've picked up
some denim I'm scared these are prime ah
these are Primark they say denim and Co
it says denim and Co denim and Co is
Primark demo code is definitely Primark
let us see what these bad boys that like
on I lost the nail I lost in
these are what these look like on there
they're no bit tight they're actually
quite a not so stretchy denim which I
don't hey there's something about the
the crotch then it isn't quite short
enough so it's kind of hang in there's a
lot of space between vag and crotch so
it kind of gives you that kind of diaper
diaper thing there but they're not
they're not bad genes they're not bad
genes at all they're bit long on the leg
is on can you see that so these are very
long legs so if you're sure there's a
lot of extra material here I'm liking my
middle-aged housewife top where I like
it
this has to stop I know I didn't pick it
this out geez I'm not even I'm not gonna
wear it

cabin in there there's elements of this
which are kind of cute
is it just me is it just me but this
isn't going to keep you warm your
kidneys are gonna be so cold and like
the way my hands can appear this but
this is not a real crime this is not a
code for life like on a day when the
weather couldn't decide what it was

fetch hashtag this is how I feel it
means it's oh I'm itching I've done with
the video I'm gonna go to bed now
this isn't here I feel like this is a
great spot where you could get Christmas
so people this is five pounds I love it
I got loads another dress says luster on
it very flimsy not nice material at all
try it on though this is so yeah I find
that some rounds that like a poo brown
on me okay so this is this dress on
which the style actually isn't awful but
it isn't doing anything for just the
lumpy bumpy region it's just in doing
anything for it and the shade of brown
is a poo brown or but the fit isn't
awful but I just hate this kind of brown
like no pull okay
sh k classics looks like some fake
varsity jacket
could you just see that it's molting on
me
I have allergies I will have allit no
it's just molting everywhere because
it's very ill fitting it's weird
it looked good on the model but on me
look struggle it says experience quality
but this is not quality this is bad and
we're back in Doris territory those an
outfit school Doris this it with the
pearls pearl watching Doris I've got
your top wow this is the Doris top if
there ever was a Doris top please just
look at that this is me Doris for the
moment to be completely honest I like it
I feel like I didn't choose the Doris
life the Doris life chose me
but I feel comfortable it's real cozy I
thought oh nice yeah this is middle aged
woman oh that I can tie it up to just
become a cute or no no no no more Doris
in the bosom yes okay here we go
this is a little body this is nice from
eight Paris was eight Paris I don't know
who that is but this is cute Wow
I'm wearing a skin tone bra it is you
guys I've got no Vera underneath is this
skin so bra I think if the way this is a
black
I've literally gone from flipping Doris
to blac chyna we China this is nice
though but look I have got a nude bra on
it this is my nude like skintone bra
Nubian skin bra look at that I love it
you guys know I love me like it any
little mesh top or something like that
and this is a nice woman I would work
with a black bra because this is a lot
in it she looks like my breasts are out
so I would wear a black bra or a black
tank or something or vest underneath but
this is you
yes bringing sexy back cook yes this is
a look Oh clearly I liked it a lot
because I picked up him white as well oh
I love this and I think that the nude
bra doesn't look so bad under the white
one I'm really like this I don't know
the lyrics I'll be like we're trying it
then we change that risk for Chinese I
like this this is gorgeous I got myself
some accessories well a little cream hat
I'm autumn winter Betty oh these are so
cute I have to bring this thing up close
so you guys can see this look at this
you know those little fur little faux
fur Russian hats as well like I'm doing
that thing where you're so excited then
you put all your outfits on at once to
be completely honest with you right you
can buy these anywhere whenever I go to
a Christmas market I always pick one of
these up I've never had a cream one
though and it breeches this on we need
to look really to look reach these hats
I love or hate some people love them
some people hate them but what I do
think is that they genuinely keep your
head warm and this was two pound fifty
actually they do keep your head warm
when it's cold you don't even care
this stinks this smells and it says this
says poof
hmm guys a hilarious work this is so
ugly this looks like we've gone back to
pensioner its stinks I did it smell it's
looks like a scarecrow out for
you know when the SCAF grow they have a
top on and they're got all this drawer
like hanging out this side this bitchy
looks like a scarecrow outfit no bueno
this is a particularly sexy red dress
thin material it's made of quite flimsy
material I'm not gonna lie but the
triops is one lady in red dress it's
quite thin so everything is on show I
love it to suck him so hard right now
this is very very sexy probably a little
bit too sexy for me I like a little bit
sexier than there's like high woman over
it's cute though okay this is a varsity
jacket I think was it jump off young
district is this young district and it's
got some Asian writing on it again it's
a little bit fake varsity the sweater
material isn't great on it let's get
this on right so this one this jumper
looks like on it's not ugly design but I
don't know there's something that's not
kosher about it it doesn't look right oh
my gosh I picked up this bra it's a new
look bra but it's cute okay yes little
balconette you look bra there I'm not
gonna try to browse the you guys I might
do a underwear haul if you want to see
me doing underwear or let me know I'll
keep balconette it's even got the new
look like badge on it so we know it's
from new look it's made of a nice
material eight Paris I've got a top that
looks very very similar to this um I'm
gonna try that on it's just a nice
little casual like top then it goes so
casual too like swag that Oh miss
expensive yes but I was only five pounds
look at that I love that little button
detail on there sometimes it's just the
little details that making a lot of
difference it's literally a really basic
top I get stuff like this on a box
that's quite nice there but we want a
bundle do you know what I saw it on
why do they have this this is just a
synthetic ponytail it's kind of shiny
though and that's a decent piece size if
I do say so myself
well that isn't even bad hair you know
for a little synthetic for five pounds
this was two pound fifty as well you're
looking for synthetic clip-in you might
be able to go to everything five pound
this is like one of those half head ones
that you put in just the back or just
the top oh bad at all it skin and it's
quite full I mean I'm not advising going
by a human hair we from everything pride
pounds if you're looking for some extra
body or volume for a night out but then
finally I've got this little black dress
let's try this on this is very nice this
is not made of right great fantastic
amazing material but it's the same kind
of stuff you can get on pretty little
things so 15 to 25 pounds so it's for
this being firepower this is a really
nice style wow that's cute though this
is a little going up slinky dress not
thick material not like yay and you know
wonderful but it's not it's not bad at
all
listen I love showing a little crab oh
cool you know little caracal goes a long
way if you don't have cleavage you have
clavicle I'm done I'm going to give you
my final thoughts right so that's it
that is my review on everything 5 pounds
I'm still wearing the dress and nothing
it um I do think this right is great to
go to for like casual home wear and it's
obviously from a lot of mainstream more
affordable stores and they're sending it
for 5 pounds which is great and that
stop that would have probably you know
they got went to landfill or maybe been
set on fire or some I don't know I don't
know how each store works but I feel
like it's quite a nice place to go to
not for like styling your whole wardrobe
you might want to just go over there
because you're looking for some pajama
sets so I thought I'm not I'm not mad at
it I think the site is cool it's not a
curated style there's nothing amazing
about the side of the items some of them
are quite cheap and thin material some
of them are quite nice
and I do feel a little bit more
comfortable knowing that a lot of the
items are like offcuts from our high
street stores although it was like from
Primark
I don't mind new look but yet it's
affordable for those of you who are
looking for something it for a bit more
of a bargain everything 5 pounds and in
total I spent 170 pounds so yeah I think
like I got a lot for my money there for
sure ok guys I think that's it from me
if you're not following my social make
sure you check me out and if you're not
subscribed do subscribe you can just
press the red button and yeah oh no
you're not I'm gonna do it I'm gonna do
it cause it clear out and organized
actually if you want to see that let me
know give me a thumbs up cuz I'll I'll
film myself doing that so you guys a lot
of people are like what does your room
look like what does your closet look
like I got bags actually bags of
clothing but I plan on giving a lot of
way to charity and also trying to sell
some to raise some money for charities
so keep your eyes peeled okay guys thank
you for watching and I'll see you later
bye
