I feel like I need to get back to thrift
lifestyle like what
hello guys welcome to my channel today
the sun is shining the weather is sweet
and we're about to take outside the
house okay you girl yeah girl is gonna
go through traffic bitch we're for sure
P yes I'm about to hit that the Charlie
Storrs the thrift stores I know I know
I've been shopping online a lot right
but it doesn't mean that I don't know
how to be thrifty you know a girl
sometimes gonna save coins
sometimes so you know we're gonna switch
off and we're gonna go outside and we're
gonna see what we can find and search
doors and then you go it's gonna try it
out is she cute or whatever we need to
know let's do this
we're in the city that's been find some
first door
we have arrived and I can see beyond
retro just across the road which is
well-known like through this door but it
can be a bit pricey I think my strategy
when it comes to to fish shopping is I'm
gonna try and find so I'm like essential
you know go to the hours that don't look
as organized I'm trying not to pay too
much and I'm going to try and get
outfits and also if I see a piece that
is like oh my gosh this is amazing I'm
picking out I'm picking out and we're
going I don't know if it's just me but
sometimes when I go into a first store
it can be very overwhelming normally I
walk in and walk straight out especially
when the bold colors hit my eyeballs but
in this store I do find there is some
kind of method to the madness and stuff
is organized and you can definitely find
some great pieces hidden
so I really felt like I had to get into
the mood while I was in this store it's
more like vintage there and I found some
good items amongst a lot of trash the
shoes were giving me orthopedic Grandma
but the denim was fantastic found some
accessories and some good little
individual pieces I think the first
thing I realized is that stuff was from
the 80s so it kind of reminded me of my
mom's clothing and it wasn't she was and
I was so I've just come out of the first
store beyond retro see this at the end
you might think someone's going through
a chaton
I still spare my hundred hours she's way
too much about the fashion actually
expensive when I see what else you can
find in this store but I'm not chose
many moments that okay let's go okay
guys I knew that it is physically up and
I hit up the charity stores to see what
goodies I could find because you know a
girl wants to be a little bit more
sustainable shopping isn't cheap
although shopping in charity shops isn't
cheap either
I spent 200 pounds in the hope that I
could get a fair few number of items but
I'm kind of quite impressed by the items
I was able to find
I paid 192 pounds and I was exhausted I
was exhausted how many of you guys
actually go to shops anymore I actually
forgot how exhausting go to the shops so
back in the day I used to go to like I
could do a whole high-speed I went to
one store and
I was he I was dying but I can't do this
I need to go home back onto internet
world back to the Internet
hashtag shopping is my cardio listen is
actually a job shopping picks up this
jacket picked up this jacket I have a
very similar jacket how much should I
pay for this 48 pounds please cut I got
as well I need to add this outside this
jacket was giving me life and then I
found this buying in denim dress this
dress is banging like this is sexy it's
sexy because the shape is sexiest made
out of some bucks denim as well and then
this this was giving me definitely
1914-1918 patchwork clear a long side
shoulder pad then Oh denim shelf shelf
denim shop shelves denim show yeah these
are me buying a real livre these costs
24 pounds and that's why I do like going
into like some of the thrift stores cuz
you can find like brand for an
affordable price a little sexy leather
number I think I've gotta wear this out
for dinner I think I'm gonna be sexy
this is actually kind of nice you know
this is 26 pounds I don't think is
entirely my size but I think I'm gonna
try and make it one up guys look at this
dress it's even giving me a booty it's
actually giving me a booty this dress is
so cool I feel like it's popping but
part of all had a dress that was quite
similar to this that's all like a
two-piece like denim piece and that was
how was another like $300 or $250 this
was 25 25 pounds or 20 pounds wow I
didn't know it but to this to look too
good on and it's shaped so well it's you
it's in it's out it's cute I can wear
this out and feel like you know just
Ronis Haiti's Funes this is really good
quality denim breed it's really hard
there's no stretch so it was kind of
like like meat going into a sausage like
you know sausages made out of select
skins and they're like sucked in that
was what was like getting into this
little number but you know you're go she
went in she got in and I love it it's
really hard denim and it I love where
all the stitching is and you say wow is
oh well you see all right next is this
the pea-jacket I'm just gonna call it a
pea-jacket I feel a little bit nervous
to put my armpits in it doesn't smell
like vo
it doesn't smile at vo it just smells
like burning piss that's what it was
I like the spite of the jacket I like
the cut of the jacket it's definitely
very 80s and vibe in relation to that
smell it needs it needs the Lord
it needs Jesus as you can see it kind of
has a weird shape done up it just looks
boxy I'd look like a TV screen
I look like a brown TVs bits Oh square
but obviously this is reflective of a
different age in session just beat it
Peter Peter just beat it it's giving me
break back i'ma wear it I'll wear it and
the thing is there's no refunds there's
no refunds on vintage so when you spray
your money that's it it's gone it's gone
alright this is another you know very
80s
give me shoulder pads style it doesn't
smell it's a little bit warm because I
can see like some stitching out and
stuff but you know so you buy it for and
give myself Theresa May right now and I
don't think I want to give myself to
resume I don't hate it it's got a vibe
by you again you see this is what my
mind is connecting to the clothing
and the ear on this I think I'm gonna
wear this with the denim shorts let's
try and put the denim shorts on I feel
like they look good together
I like the fact that they've got the
slits here the shorts are not quite
cutting it I don't know why they're so
small look I check him when he can't do
them up maybe the sizing is a little bit
smaller but I will say is that these
tall like and like he this loop is
already damaged and there's a hole here
so maybe because the denim is a bit
older it's a little bit more fragile oh
yeah
yo got you know that weight gain
sometimes it's farther than sometimes
you ripped jeans last two bits let's try
these on okay so this guy is actually
very nice I love a good pencil skirt
oh it's shining it's reflective hugging
the curve I really like the fit of this
so yeah yeah okay this top it's kind of
hot in scent again this is giving me the
vibe up you know what I think it's
really nice it's kind of giving me the
vibe of like a mums cartoon but beat it
but I like the way it goes like this and
I like this thing is really cool don't
know if it goes with the leather skirt
or not but this was basically in a
section that was all like shiny those
beaded down everywhere and then this is
a nifty little number that I found in
that selection is that what can I
actually wear out and about and I think
this even with Jesus or God that also
picked up this very random looking belt
it was eight it was eight pounds over a
prime and a size and I was like this to
go over good could it go here so I feel
like I'm going back in time with my
style right now is it giving you like a
past vibe I feel like it's giving me a
pass by we're gonna Rob this I think we
can make this work or I like it I feel
like I need to go back to thrift
lifestyle
like what so next few days
where these goodies I'm gonna try and
wear a vintage item add a create for
looks and be cute so today I'm wearing
this I feel like a corporate grandma and
we're just gonna call it as it is
corporate grandma but like some swag
going on I don't know so I've worn it
with the little leather skirt which is
actually quite short and I'm currently
debating what shoes am I going to wear
with this look I said hits me rocking it
with a little boot oh that's actually
all right or I could just wear it with
like a trainer or just a sneakers you
guys cool it
oh I feel like I definitely look like
I'm not dressed like yeah average
average I feel like I definitely look
like oh who's that weird combo from what
real says that I do feel like that it's
a bit mature so it's like it was hard to
find a bag to pair that didn't look
really mature and like even this bag it
looks like I'm wearing my cowboy
eighties jacket today you actually
really like how it fits the one bad
thing is of course no one likes to be
smelly so I have I've dowels
when I say doubt I would douse this in
perfume and we're about to get on a
plane so I'm really hoping that I don't
like smell well you know into it for
YouTube right
go to the airport how to nap in my
jacket I've become desensitized to this
smell
I don't know if that's a good thing or a
bad thing yeah it's not can't feel very
good they're very cute miss jacket off
to pods now being all thrifty yeah not
mad
Oh wah
so today I'm wearing the denim little
number it's rising it's why I didn't
quite a bit but I still fuck you you are
getting a little boobage but it's not
it's not like too much you know I feel
very comfortable in this I feel like
I've been saying that about every single
item I've been wearing I like it feel
very cute I even wore the smelly we Jake
which is it doesn't stink much to me now
I wore that over it like over my
shoulders and yeah so far so good
my go-to style I did find that and
different and I did find that people
were like oh wait did you get that item
from like a thrift did it
I really blues very proud when I get a
bargain or something from somewhere that
is it when you normally get stuff from
I'm back garlic oh my gosh I got my
answer from you know wherever I got it
from I am that kind of person and I feel
like a lot of the clothes kind of
inspired questions like that I will say
in hindsight really paying 25 pounds for
thrifty secondhand items isn't
necessarily cheap or real-world first in
what I really need to find is those
one-pound items those 50p items but
sometimes I feel like those places don't
even exist anymore I know that 25 pounds
for certain things or even 50 pounds for
a jacket or one of the jackets I had was
40 pounds 50 so yeah
that isn't exactly cheap what are you
expecting from 15 but I do like the idea
of worrying you know clothes that's a
little bit more recycled not as fast
fashion and also you know pre-loved with
some history to it I'm not against that
at all as long as you can find some cute
items that don't smell like fried we
like that's the only I could describe
some of the stuff so that was on my cons
the stink the stink on the jacket and it
think I like washed and I should have
probably taken the jacket to the dry
cleaners I was just like he said I'm not
dry cleaning this way in vintage
50-pound jacket
I don't mind stuff that looks a little
bit worn as long as it doesn't have
holes in it or is it damaged but worn is
actually a look in my opinion so I think
that I am done
oh and I feel like somebody looks kind
of mini it feel very mumsy and sober
summer but another word that I'm not
gonna wear that but if you've got time
and if you're looking for items that are
unique I would definitely try thrifting
spend some money but it probably isn't
gonna be as cheap or as a bargain as you
probably think it's gonna be but it's
worth it at least you know you're kind
of doing good I don't know shopping is
shopping good who knows but yeah that's
my thoughts let me know what you guys
think are you sisters have you got
really good items with thing is it
something to be embarrassed about
doing let me know what you guys think
but in the meantime I will catch you all
later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
