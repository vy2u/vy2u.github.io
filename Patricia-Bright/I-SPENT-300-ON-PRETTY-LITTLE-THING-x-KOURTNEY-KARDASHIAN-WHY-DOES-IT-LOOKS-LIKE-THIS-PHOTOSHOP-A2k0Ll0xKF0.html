beautiful people welcome to my channel I
hope you are doing well I'm excited as I
always am and seeing as we are in the
season of brightness I thought how to a
little bit of a fun extra special I
spent a video I decided you know I
wanted to get in there I wanted to see
what I could find on pretty little
things and I know I haven't done and I
spread a video on Fotolia two things so
I thought I would do it and if you don't
know Kourtney Kardashian launched a
range on there which to me that it
wasn't gonna break like it looks just a
little bit a little bit suspect II for
me I was a bit like bags Kourtney is fly
this woman is going on forties and looks
absolutely phenomenal and you know she's
in Bombay and she's in designers and
then I was like pretty little things
really they really must have given you a
hasty check a tasty check but it's all
good and then I saw the collection I was
out what is some racy AF but I wasn't
really gonna buy it until I saw this
picture of this woman who like bought
the oversize jumpsuit thing and then she
put it like her look of it next to the
Kourtney Kardashian one and it was
struggle it was struggle with a case I
thought you know let me go check it out
and on Twitter you guys are like that
treasure yeah just like that
so that okay I'm gonna do it right so I
went on to pretty little things the
website and I'm telling you the prices
were so discounted like things are like
nine pounds like the top was nine pounds
the dress was ten pounds from the
Kourtney Kardashian collection I was
like it was cheap in my mind it was a
little bit too cheap I was like why is
everything so cheap but it was on 70%
off so everything's been discounted and
I don't know if it's obviously because
we're coming up to Christmas then with
Black Friday bars like you know what let
me spin some coin let me see what I can
find and I ended up spending 252 pounds
and
at $5.99 I spent on shipping and next
day delivery so yeah the site is really
easy to do it's got really nice like you
know branding and merchandising it's
very girly and fun like pretty little
things like you know all that kind of
jokes you kind of know what you're
getting with a lot of these websites so
I'm gonna stop talking and we're just
gonna see if we can slay in pretty
little things let's get into this video
oh if you're not subscribed to subscribe
if you're not follow me on my social
follow me on my Instagram on my snapchat
on my Twitter I do giveaways especially
during the brightness Christmas season
right let's get into this video okay I'm
not gonna lie there was a lot of sequins
a lot of lace a lot of shine oh my gosh
you know what it isn't bad but where am
I going like this they've got fancy look
what they put on here they're like no
one's gonna be wearing this and
returning it honestly I cannot even fit
into this it's so small using it you can
see my crack oh yeah got it cannot
breathe cannot breathe it looks super
small on Kourtney in the images and it
looks super small on I actually think
it's quite nice I just wish that it was
longer like these need some more
material on the bottom but I do think
this looks like what it looks like on
the advertising just teeny tiny do you
need tiny oh I see though I love the
straight neck and I like the arms and
actually the material is quite nice I've
got this in the size a and I'm like no
it's too small
and ya know next up is these these
oversized jumpsuits Oh Lord this is now
10 pounds and this is it look at the
size of this it's bigger than me as a
person it's bigger than me as a person
okay let's try it on really there's
oversized and then this clown size
look at this hello darkness my old
friend no amount of high heels or
platform is going to stop this on
dragging up the dirt on the floor hold
on let me just try let me just try and
snatch who thought of this it's crazy is
that and like it has a little boy to see
but honestly this is like a waste paper
bag my foot is fully dragging this on
the floor what is this new scale you
guys know I'm always complaining that I
can never find arms that fit me
these are doing the uttermost that look
there's other besides and then there's
like ridiculous this is a big case of
expectation versus reality okay so I saw
this combo all over pretty little things
Courtney looks smashing in it let's see
what I am it right okay so the top I
don't quite like the top it's a little
bit I don't wear like clothes that are
like this it's not really my thing
for me I'm just like where am I going
like with my leg like this I do like the
fact that it's high-waisted though it
fits quite nice on the back you know
from the but this looks kind of cute I
just cannot imagine me ever leaving my
house like this like never lift at the
bottom of these they just they just fit
very weird and you can see my underwear
so I don't know where you're going with
these I just don't know where to go with
these you wear these like over your arm
that would work that would actually work
okay now that I've tied to up it
actually fits a lot better I actually
think they look kind of nice I do think
that that's you know this is very sexy
for Patricia sexy right there well I
think it's quite sexy that let the lever
bralette and everything I feel like
Courtney was going through a midlife
crisis with this collection because I
know I'm not I'm not anyway Nick to cook
cortney's a drum a bit
you know what rock whatever you wanna
rock whatever age you are whatever body
you have I actually quite like it you
can't tell me nothing but my genuine
question is where you when you wear this
to where I think the little lace-ups
cute okay this is a jumpsuit Oh Lord
nipple to the wind I can tell is you
know that fake velvet but you know it
looks nice and then put it on let's see
where that site oh my god it's - it's a
little bit like a sexy cat suit mom's
curtain all in one like look at the
boobage I had to you know I have to do a
ticket I think it double-sided tape
because my breasts will gain but flying
to the utter wind nipple to the wind for
sure you know I love a jump - cat suit
but in your mum's cut and print
I'm not sure about that I like the fit
yeah hold up break the back break the
back break the back for that extra coat
look at that it's a back-breaking
Instagram pose it's not bad you know
it's not it's kind of cute hold on let
me get the pose on yes it's not a bad
time no it's cute new year new me hey
you know there's a lot of brushes a lot
of brush that's it I don't usually wear
these that go all the way down to here
it just looks a little a little a little
March by the way I've got the back
covered should going on hello that cover
charm but for me the print isn't is very
is very stand out it's very garish I
just have this in plain black or like
you know burgundy paint Burgundy
so I saw this all over the advertising
lime green something or the other
this is nothing more than a 19 they're
not thinner than MIT who's working this
outside who it costs 10 pounds so I
understand that he probably realized
maybe this was a mistake
really really nah like this is a lime
green 90 look at this
you can see the armpit vagina heavily
heavily through hair it doesn't even fit
well actually a my liking this is for a
second I mean I would wear this at home
like cookie jar it's only ten clips I
probably would wear it at home
but how this could be considered a style
that you'd wear out oh and it's sticking
you know where you have that kind of
magnetic I'm kind of really cheap
polyester and it kind of feels like
magnetic against you
that's what that's like and you know
what's gonna happen your bottoms going
to eat eat the dress and you'll be done
seeing you'll be out and about and your
crack will just be looking like very
unhappy literally the wedgie of life and
it's the one who don't know you have it
until somehow you realize hold on this
is just stuck between my Bochy I don't
know what this is black extreme mini is
it a stuff oh is it a course a very is
very little it's very little do you know
what the faux leather it's made out of
isn't too bad this is only ten pounds as
well okay let's try this on I think it's
really nice but why is it so damn small
honestly look this is the stuff that
makes me feel old right I would never
it's cute though it's kind of cute but I
just would never in my life be out in
public we've addressed this short I like
the way it comes up and this is although
it looks like a tiny applique a penis it
isn't actually like that bad I like the
way the V looks it kind of gives you a
bit more color and this is a size 10
right but I can tell it's a little bit
too big for me do you know what I would
I actually would give New Year you yeah
I guess cute okay this is if you wanna
be like you know what I've come to the
party and I don't care do you know what
even though it's short what it has it
has got a dip right there and it's got a
dip right here that makes it not as
short but the sides are really short I
swear if you sat down literally you're
gonna you're listen there's so much look
at the
there's a lot of air right to the crotch
like it I like the oblique Li detail do
you guys see that probably can't see it
looks like that I don't hang it I'll
rock it but bubble to the wind yeah this
is it I think they're like match in
little blazer from oh I mean wearing it
together is doing the uttermost
why is there no buttons on me sickest
all right if I like the little satin
here there's no Blazers 30 pounds and I
like the applique detail and I like the
fit of it but it just needs a button on
it but it's made well and it's almost
like a little dress but it's a cute
little blazer I would I so would this is
a me blazer
I love days no no you guys know I'm the
Gucci thought so you know this on a
Saturday and then this on a Sun okay so
the other sort of mini dresses has not
ended look at this this this is
literally a piece of orange tinfoil
orange it's literally nothing there the
material is so thin
nothing I feel like this is gonna suit
my skin tone today let's rock it like a
roast turkey in a burnt foil everything
about this I hate I like the color
no I look like the turkey in burnt brown
foil my mama's good though that's not
been working out I haven't been
yes Miller booty but I've got a front
booty as well hey booty booty I call
this my bus money baby
rice is life I only see the hole of the
belly button
that's what you know the material is too
cheap and too thin and needs to go back
on the rail however this dress is 7
power
I fight hard burgers what what is the
dress like christmas is coming if you
wanna wrap your tacky and for your just
buy this dress you know I'm gonna tell
you that there's gonna be a girl with
some super tight body yeah who's gonna
make this look so expensive and nice but
I see my belly button hole in here I'm
like no see Courtney's in this like this
I that's how Kourtney looks in this that
here's me in the Kourtney bows I feel
like I'm gonna break my back oh my oh my
hip oh that seems to be an excessive
amount of these appliqués I feel like
they got these in stock and they just
said you know what let's just stick it
on everything this like faux leather
jacket it's actually 30 pounds which is
really cheap for a biker Duckett jacket
uh-huh oh it's Elvis
esque the sleeves are really long you
know what it's not a bad option if you
were looking for like a fake leather
jacket that had a little something about
it I'm a little bit of a faux leather
jacket or leather jacket snob so this
isn't up my street and I can I can smell
the plastic from here that she smells
like like just just like a rub rubber
ass like it's just ridiculous it just
smells like rubber you know it isn't a
bad fit you know it isn't a bad thing it
isn't for me but it isn't a bad fit if
you like like a throw leather jacket
well though I said it's shiny some
people like that you know look at
jumping on them in my boutique oh yeah
it's growing on me it's really growing
on me it's growing on me cuz I like it
now you know I'm just gonna have fun
with money
Oh oil dress my leather jacket with its
you know down wanti applique hey let's
roll let's do this okay
black strappy seats in bodycon dress
okay so it's made of the same secret
EEMA Tyrael and the first one but it's
just a different style I kind of like
this okay so this is what this black
mini dress looks like this is my
favorite of all the items of the
collection being the fact that you
cannot see my internal organs I think
everything is just so thin this isn't a
lot fit car I feel like it's nice I
could wear this on a night out even
though it's sure it's not like you know
all the way inner thigh Shore I like the
way it fits actually it's cute I think
it fits really nice this is just such a
nice piece I look I really really really
like this I'm hollering I'm screaming I
did see this and I was like what the
hell and though bright furs are in but
these are bright a air lime green
I think this is exactly how Courtney
wore it on like the ad it's my eyes hurt
no it's mine this is actually a nice
fire this is a nice foot the color is
dead but the firm is a really nice book
it's really wore look at the lime green
this is a I have arised foodie party
this is that I have a rad jacket it's 40
pounds which Sabonis is about right for
a faux fur jacket I thought it was gonna
be like a really cheap bag
trust me you guys are see me buying
coats so you know I know the difference
between a cheap fur and a nice fur this
is a good faux fur like this is a good
one it's something I like about this
color though I don't know what I feel
like it much is my hair gonna have fun
in life oh my gosh look at my pose
pose no pose okay another black dress
this actually looks quite nice as well
so at this point in time we have a clear
perspective of the kind of clothing that
usually you're going to get on pretty
little things I don't think this is from
the Kourtney Kardashian range I just
think it is on pretty lot of things yes
you can see my underwear because I
wasn't trying to D D pant or remove my
underwear for this video but you get the
vibe I can see where this would be nice
on a night out it's an 11-pound dress
it's very sexy
quite fill material but you know I'm not
mad in it I don't hate it it's just not
you're not gonna find me / you're not
actually this is the one where I would
do my little bougie thought moment in
I'm not that comfortable being like
commando like visibly commando like yeah
like you know what you know that I've
got no underwear on with this dress oh
my gosh I've got I've got to do some
fashion hacks on you guys I've lived in
fashion hats video there is something I
want to show you all this is very you
know planning to the wind basically got
that people will have to know I don't
hate it
okay guys that is me done I'm gonna give
you guys my final thought I think you're
gonna want to tune in for this bit okay
make sure okay guys I am done I am tired
oh my gosh that was house a lot that was
a lot so that was me trying on goody
some pretty little things and I
specifically tried out the Kourtney
Kardashian the rage and my overall
thoughts were I'm confused I was up
confused there's definitely some coupe
it's like the sequin dress is but you
know I was like attacking at Christmas
in some of them and yeah there are some
dates I do like there but the majority
was a letdown
and I don't normally I'm not usually
this harsh when I do these videos but I
mean a little bit but I just felt like
really Courtney but she's my favorite
Kardashian
that was definitely party club where was
I it's a quick cheap fast Club where
like you know what you're gonna go to
Tiger Tiger you weren't going to go to
some you know little club down the high
street you might want to buy a 10-pound
dress or a five-pound dress on pretty
little things as part of that range I'm
not mad at that
that is what what you're gonna go and
get your edited pieces for a dinner date
okay so you haven't realized what it's
there for it's like if you want a cheap
party dress sure why not but yeah
price-wise it was good I mean 10 pounds
is not six pounds five pounds I totally
get it and I thought I appreciate that
but yet it the price was reflective of
the product so guys that is it for me
that is me done that's me I'm spending a
money i spending I spent a video on
pretty little thing particularly the
Kourtney Kardashian range if you guys
want me to do any other do you not I
have a few coming up but those are
coming it's Christmas time so we gone I
think I'm gonna do it every week stay
