to my channel I hope you are doing well
today it is a good day for a couple of
reasons number one gets his merch has
now arrived
to be honest I did this because you guys
requested it there's so many comments of
Patricia can you put that on the t-shirt
please I do kind of have a couple of
slogan but you know Shannon Shannon who
go wow we've got the United State Mint
side saying I feel like I never really
like I say them until you guys repeat
them back to me I go oh yeah I really do
say that quite a lot but you know what
let me create something and see if you
guys are interested and so we don't live
with submerge it's my shine and shine
and t-shirt we also have a Wow one and
then also some sweatshirts but you can
see them all on my store down below I'm
only gonna do it for a very limited
period of time it's gonna be from April
till for either for two weeks or until
the end of May let's see what you guys
like I know some other people have been
like we need an apple to the wind
t-shirt we need a darling t-shirt we
need a rich in color rich in life so you
got the time to give me what do you not
say right crazy right I know I know I
know it said mad right I've got two
million followers like it just seems so
weird and so strange to me but I never
feel like I'm popular if that makes any
sense I've never I was never a popular
girl you know I was always like awkward
like just just I'm just that person so
for me it's always getting ground to
this idea that there are people who like
like me I don't know it's hard to fire
them but it's down below you can check
it out and yeah if you want to support
you're going you wanna get so much and
be showering in shadows aren't no you
can join in and if you send many videos
and clips of you guys wearing it please
do I always share them or Instagram and
my snapchat and I'll just make my day it
would just make my day so the second
reason I'm happy you know what I want to
say I like you but I don't like you guys
like it's just a it's a two-part story
because I haven't been into the school
that we are doing a video on for a good
three years potentially for four years
but the biggest request I keep getting
is Patricia can do an ice better on
Primark what what what why are you doing
this to me for my American followers I
think you
I actually have Primark in stores
nowadays Primark is basically a store
that's really affordable like really
really affordable it's got every single
style that you can possibly find for
really really cheap in every single
color and it's just fast but they have
the new stars every day and I feel like
I face the nemesis because and when I
was young going to shopping permit
full-time go in love it my hot water it
was a primer it was a primer right Manny
you know at those days you didn't call
it pragma we couldn't pry manly enough
for Hermione you know and and I got so
stay divided walk in I'm like this and I
would walk out look at that I can't I
can't take this dress I can't take the
changing room I can't take all the
people I cut mickey out tickets however
I faced my nemesis Adam oh boy
boy did I face my nemesis I have got
three huge bags and I spread the plug it
I think it was 308 pounds receipts Rat
Man except it wasn't as crazy as I
remember it being there weren't too too
too many people there and actually the
kid was not that long it wasn't as bad
as I remember I remember - in fact I was
in primer but it wasn't that long but I
didn't hit the changing rooms so what I
picked up we're gonna try it on here
we're gonna see what Primus in its 2018
but they've also got many make up but
we're gonna do another video in that
later and prymaat makeup if you want to
see it slap the like button smash the
like button
yeah I think that's it few clips on me
shopping and then let's get into this
video company in the offing bum bag in
hand I'm bout to hit Primark I don't go
to promo losses like how do you not like
fine Lydia always get stuff in a robot
that's really good and like that from
chef Kaimana
never good primal I am
I'm nervous what of them way this is
quite a scratch this is all private yes
a crime on nidia said guess what she's
all Primark okay a well why not
first impression seeing is I've not been
in Primark for about every year it's
it's not as money cuz I remember but
maybe it's the time of day and
everything looks nice and tidy on the
rail this and lot of stuff
every dress is kind of giving me a
little house on the prairie well
Patricia no not more things it's kind of
a cute little jumper I didn't see that
one what a shame look at the queue bags
bags on bags what I will say is that you
do get a lot for your money in Primark
no lies so this is the faux leather Jack
never open faux leather jacket ten
pounds it was 23 pounds and this is now
10 pounds oh well we've got quite short
arms but relatively I actually think
this is quite nice I think it's really
nice if you like it guys so this is a
look it's 10 pounds I mean it's hard to
go wrong and the fact the fabric is
really quite nice as well all right I'm
not surprised because I looked at it I
was like that is a bargain and it's also
a good piece and I feel like that
actually looks really cute like they're
like length of it as well it's just you
know you know just above the body kind
of gives a little bit of an illusion of
additional shape this is a nice little
jacket okay another jacket I only picked
up two jackets I believe this is a faux
denim jacket and this is 20 pounds I
mean 20 pounds isn't necessarily cheap
but it's all a lot some really nice on
you know 20 pounds is cheap it is cheap
because most likely denim jacket so like
50 pounds now but no lie that fits Bob
do you do is actually fits really nice
it's like wide it's cropped I love the
wash of it is what I love love like kind
of a proper acid-washed denim especially
during spring white tea black jeans
denim jacket I feel like it's always a
really good combo I mean I wanted to be
a hater
these are nice
nice is it supersonically my kind of
jacket supersonically my kind of jacket
okay 20 pounds I'm not mad at that I am
not mad at that Primark
I'm not gonna lie the store was struck
struggling in the dress Department it
wasn't good looking
everything was grandma season I was at
what on earth DJ this was this this whom
I think I love this was the best I could
find in the dress Department and I'm
looking right at this it just looks like
a sailor's wife dress I'm not even going
to be a moment drinking but it's six
pounds okay my booty slightly popping
but I've been going to the gym people I
have been doing the little work a little
work in the gym how we have a little
shape here we got a little stray from a
little bit of gym so we just had a
movement feeling myself there I don't
hate it you know what this would be much
nicer as a t-shirt that just a little
striped t-shirt throw a little bit
grandma s but this could be worn on
holiday like a little holiday stripe
dress if you're going sailing you know
if you want to be an actual sailors like
oh I'm sorry I'm just seeing my bomb
looking long and a bit national flag
Shawn we got a little booty pallet then
- you know what would you ever buy a
dress just because it made your body
look good I feel like this makes me look
good ish but grandma rich as well so
it's a hard dynamo I like the fact that
it isn't too low but it isn't ooh
so I wanted to buy a bit of everything
to see what I could find of all the bags
most of them look like they look very
plastic and they look very faint but
this bag was the most decent bag that I
could find there and I still don't like
it
I suppose I just wanted to show you
what's there what's there but this was
the best I could find actually don't
think it's a bad bag I think it's really
good I think it
trend especially in comparison to
everything else I'm sure there was a
jacket let me see if I can find the
jacket there was a a jacket a blazer
jacket wow this is really gonna be a lot
together
yeah it's giving me actual singer a rich
man with a yacht look so the trousers
are 15 pounds and the Blazer
is 20 pounds they're like 35 pounds for
the entire suit and then I'm gonna put
one of these little resting I bought all
these vests and they're four pounds
can't be honest of you guys the trousers
are really nice they're actually nice
like shitty nice whether or not I need
to be rocking the trousers and the oh
Lord okay I take it back
the trousers were nice fit by themselves
I probably work with like a great or a
white top then alongside with the blazer
I feel like a pimp on a street corner
like I should be Bugsy Malone to be
honest that is the blades are nice I
thought I'd look cool I think I just
look struggle also the Blazer doesn't
have any buttons or anything so it's not
like can I put it together what a
because she'd be nice if I could put it
together or something like that I don't
know I feel like any like it like this I
mean when I stand like this actually
looks kind of cool but you can't stand
like this for like the rest of your life
just to earn an outfit okay next up we
are gonna go for some denim these are
the the golf girlfriend jeans would you
be my girlfriend be Shannon's the
girlfriend Jean size 8 15 pounds it'd
look nice they actually look like
they're nice I bought another one of
these vests so this isn't in the black
they're really nice and I feel like
they're gonna wash well and I feel like
pry marks really good for the kind of
basics like this I also picked up one in
a grey and this kind of pinky color as
well which i think is kind of cute these
jeans have no stretch in them they're
pure cotton I don't know how I feel
about that and so you selling something
like crack in my jeans that you know
kind of nice you know
all things a little bit of a casual
cowboy look casual cowboy the jeans my
bottom looks like a full-blown pancake
it looks like it look at it look at my
bum it's invisible it's invisible
it's invisible and it's indented but
from the front the jeans fit really
nicely what happens what and that's it
that's a deal-breaker like you all of
this it fits so nicely it feels so good
and like the way it looks they really
like proper denim II but no the vest on
the other hand that this versus poor
just the black one looks really nice on
this one that's really nice on I feel
like it's the kind of thing you can just
work with a cardigan or just under
clothing and I think like you always
need stuff like this in your wardrobe a
genius on the front they look so good on
but from the back listen there's so many
angles I could cut someone because it's
just no parallelogram just flat just
square just the box no check genuinely
check out the jeans how cute of the
jeans there's slightly a bit short on my
ankle but I don't mind that look how
cute they look from the front right and
then they just look pitiful pitiful from
the back it's a check out the pink vest
how are cute is the pink vest all the
best of a definite key part like you're
staying on my wardrobe you're four
pounds I'm gonna buy you in every single
color I wish that's a car key and don't
think I picked a cocky up but I think
the best of really really nice little
basics to put in your wardrobe okay I
did pick up another jacket was this in
sale no this is 25 pounds okay bring up
another kind of faux suede kind of biker
jacket um doesn't over the t-shirt it's
not bad it's not bad it's not bad but
it's not like the coolest bit this is
like you Jack hit your mum buys and
she's trying to be cool like daughter
I've got to let her Joe cute and then
ever you like no mum that's what this
looks like on cheese so they had
leggings to pound fifty four leggings if
you ever need
just have more leggings in your wardrobe
but the thing is I feel like these don't
love us and I've got leggings at last
and I've got leggings that don't last
and I feel like these don't my last
although it says improve quality moving
there's been an issue in the past but
they're two pound fifty they had so many
logo sweats it was unbelievable this is
this one which says San Francisco these
are seven pounds then they're not like
proper sweat they come out the cheat
sweat material that isn't bad though I'm
gonna wear that together another another
what this is five pounds this is so
cheap it's very thin material though I
can't lie okay so this is this look on
here I mean papi wants a safe and
legging is a legging but I've got to say
that these leggings feel particularly
cheap I feel like you could if I turns
around you could see my my kidneys yeah
it's quite thin and I feel like they're
the ones that if you bend down that
they're gonna ride all the way down but
listen I I don't I don't feel secure in
these I feel I feel very naked in these
leather
although the crotches are bad we don't
have a camel there's no sign of camel
here which is really good I really like
that look no guys look at my bum look at
my booty like honestly you can actually
see the crack and it's only cause we're
friends I'm showing you this but why can
you see literal within my butt crack
like that's doing the most prime up
prime are leggings will get you
demonetized ladies crap so the end yeah
and then this is this jumper on it's a
nice little jump up I like the cut and
everything it's thin material but the
style is cool like if you after this
crop style you got it you're gonna feel
really really cheap here it's not bad as
a look it isn't bad I'm just questioning
we're gonna be serious you can buy
everything four five six seven eight
pounds gray but when you wash it and it
disintegrates into dust were you left
them seven pounds down the drain okay so
next up I went through the suit swim
section
there were a few nice pieces but I did
see this swim set which I thought was
really really cute I had to pick up the
size 16 pop top because the size 8 or 10
cut top it wouldn't even have covered my
nipple it wouldn't have covered so I
actually picked up a size 16 so I could
get something that would cover my boob
and yeah let me see what this looks like
on we've got to be careful we're on
YouTube but yet swimsuit is for
educational purposes educational
purposes
oh I've also got the bottoms in a size
16 well that isn't gonna work I also
picked up just some joggers with the
stripe okay so I actually think that the
bikini looks really really nice it's in
a size 16 so what I have to do is like
tie it rather than use the left and tied
it and I've tied it at the top really
tight because it is too big for me but
for me this is like a good cup size but
if I don't want to have literally my
feeders feeding the world it's not too
bad it's got this like mesh detail as
well that separator I don't know if you
can see that on camera
unfortunately the trousers are giving me
Fupa Kingdom we're just gonna quit food
for Kingdom which is just fatty upper
pubis area here is looking like a bag of
meat don't know why I love so chunky but
I do think it's good I pulled them up a
little bit high but actually when I put
it down it doesn't look bad it actually
looks okay
less food coats so here's kind of smooth
and then I mean for trend pair of
trousers they're not bad they're not bad
at all
this is what they look like from down
below with the poppers or open and
everything not bad not bad okay so some
other stuff I found some joggers jogger
sweats these are 8 pounds and what I
thought was cool is that they kind of
rush at the end and then high-waisted so
they might be cute I thought it might
look nice with this little bit of a a
little something-something let's see
what these look like Auden we're just
gonna call this outfit how to get your
blood circulation to cut off because
this top is a size 4 it is cutting off
the roots
definition height wealthy in the top
very long who knew that stores sold size
for but this is sites for but in my size
this top would have been care yet in my
side that would have been cute but it is
really hanging on for dear life on me
right about now the joggers are no we're
not
Jim guys want to look muscley and then
they wear really tight pops or really
tight joggers so you can see they're
like we can see at all this is what
these drivers so like they're not really
jobless they're more like jogger
leggings they are more like jogger
leggings but I feel it quite nice at
night the kind of look if I would wear
on a daily basis PC how they're like
skinny at the ankle
they're just skinny all over but not in
a bad way they're not bad at all they're
actually quite warm eight pounds but you
know they're not bad at all again I
think my bum looks quite peachy in them
as well
peach but not too peachy not like you
can see it just slightly peachy
okay so I actually found that I picked
up the same top in white in a size 10 so
you can was gonna squeeze into that and
then I picked up some more denim as well
um and it's got this red stripe down the
side
okay so size 10 fits a lot better and
but I thought my the top is see-through
it's very see-through if you know view
in real life you could probably see my
nips because it is kind of quite thin
material but it is nice I thought I
needed an 8 in this actually just so it
was that fitted and little bit more but
it isn't a bad little off the shoulder
top but it isn't amazing and then the
jeans the jeans fit kind of mash my bum
does not look sad she looks happy she
looks sweet
she looks lifted from the shadows that
is what we need in a jean lift her up
don't don't breathe out lift her up a
little huh they look really good these
are a size a I've been no touch too
small I feel like I might need a 10
because I don't know maybe this is like
the new style but these are basically
cropped to my knee cap why they say crop
they're so short on the leg we but they
do fit nice
love the color and I actually like the
striped eater right move away from the
counter stop I saw this top it's ten
pounds
it's kind of a see-through for me
it could be nice and holiday okay so
this is 10 pounds I think this is
actually cute I feel like a lady of
leisure in it a little bit you know
hello it mumsy a little bit mumsy but
you know what holiday season is coming
spring roll is we've had slowed brooms
should be here soon and I feel like this
isn't quite a nice cup that you could
work on holiday then anything I'll save
that look one sour move and we are a nip
slip away from being centered because
it's you have to tie it at the front and
it isn't a wrap so I can try to wrap it
all the way around instead what we have
is you know the feeders have come out to
play
I mean I could say to tape it I go to
the tape it or something but you need to
wear a little something on the inside or
it needs to be like a wrap you know if
not the rest of us Oh girls are singing
hello can you give me but I do like the
color I think I'd be really nice on
holiday was like a little bikini on the
inside we could do that another thing I
picked up is Jim where they had our
whole gym collection and they're not
really good but I found this like car
peepee and I said well why don't have
our any car key Jim bottoms what these
are eight pounds which is affordable and
then I found this black top as well so
let's see if it looks good on okay I am
impressed I am really impressed with
this gym top it is giving me support and
it's black with all this extra little
detail on it can you see that but it's
giving me support and it's kind of long
in the body I'm really impressed and
really impressed it fits really really
well I can tell instantly this is going
to be a good gym top on it fits really
really well and then the leggings are
pretty they're pretty big look check out
my peach peach peach you got a little
peach and I love all the design and
everything on it but
hold on hold on hold on ah squat test oh
yeah okay squat test you pass the squat
test they passed the squat test but they
feel like they're falling down because
they aren't like they're not very high
waisted so they feel like they're
dropping listen this is what a mum baby
looks like I had a baby I prefer my
leggings to be much higher in the waist
they're nice but they're just they're
just too short for me finally I had to
pick up some shoes I had to pick up some
shoes
Primark used to be the place I used to
get all my shoes and I'm not gonna lie
some miss shoes were giving me
orthopedic status they just look so
bulky and just like no and when your
feet as big as mine then last thing what
you want to do is add more bulk and
width to a size 8 foot like we just we
just don't need to do that we just need
to sit down and not do that so these are
Cooper and what these would look cute on
and let's try them on let's see um Wow
well they tried this is what these shoes
look like they tried they wanted to be
cool they wanted to fit in they tried
they will get them will give them like a
c- we'll give them a c- they tried in it
they're comfortable but obviously they
don't fit really well here little that
grateful not bad
they're not awful no what's the matter
that I could probably see me keep no no
they they look really henching chunky no
in person they look chunky and he'll
fitting and I don't write them okay guys
so that is it from me I was pleasantly
surprised people pleasantly surprised it
was a lot better than I remember because
I didn't have an awful shopping
experience and I feel like some of the
stuff was really good I feel like 60 to
75% of it was actually quite nice and
then the rest of it was like kind of
quite cheap like let's boo-boo is kind
of cheap but in my opinion you know a
lot is going to go back just sayin
but there are a few pieces that are gems
I'm like yes I need this especially like
those vests they were super
a few different pieces I'm not okay you
might make it into my main wardrobe so
well it no I think it's actually worth
going in
I wouldn't say go ham and go crazy and
pick up everything but one or two basics
one or two pieces yes and then some of
that that stuff work a little bit like
this is just tact just tact but I feel
like this using some gems amongst the
TAT as well and I'm gonna be a regular
primal shopper and no but I'm not mad if
anyone decides you know what I want to
buy a few pieces from Primark do your
thing go save your money and if you want
to be trendy then be trendy that is your
business
okay guys that is it from me give this
video a thumbs up if you want want to
see primal makeup video let me know in a

piece of much and I've it in the
