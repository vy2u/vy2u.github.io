prayer but you know your questions have
been answered today is the day that we
are going to review before we get into
the closer the core life I have like the
trauma because of this like it's
actually kind of insane so let me give
you a bit of insight into battle if you
haven't seen that fall I don't know
where you've been right it's anywhere
anytime you see somewhere in a swimsuit
on Instagram on YouTube and 9% of the
time it's an example so they are known
for having swimsuits and stuff and lots
of people do swimsuit war but they also
sell and a lot of kind of other stuff my
favorite of wearing muscles can be
having Brown I saw her looking fabulous
example and other people and I'm like
okay okay you're out here with the big
dogs right with the big dogs and then
what was kind of crazy right I got about
three to four emails from as Apple and
it's on different people like it's not
the same person they offered me a lot of
money to do menu I'm telling you there
are some bad big salads but I wanted not
to do that there's a mother taught me in
my trash so yeah I've used my money and
I'm going to give you guys an honest and
kind of review and I feel like we've
been enjoying this series here and I
just Google probably another plate okay
I was I wasn't willing to let you guys
down for this moment so maybe I'll do
another battle video and I guess I'll
take your money I'll do your video but
this one here it's about to be an
absolute original so yeah the first
thing I want to get into is the website
I'm not going to lie it made me so angry
it was very frustrating it was a bit of
a chaotic mess all the images of
different sizes on different backgrounds
I was it's not I'm on the website now
and this wasn't best pleased I didn't
like the website many angry and also I
really liked that if I wasn't doing this
video I would have clicked on and be
like oh and include substrate on that is
what the website felt like secondly and
felt like there are some images that
were non-kosher so there was a picture
particularly that I saw of an outfit and
the girl in the picture is someone who I
follow on Instagram who I really really
like and I write they just put this
girl's picture out here back in there I
love her page right so when I saw her it
was like oh this guy is legit she's our
example all right so I went to her page
and she doesn't woman my battle but then
I realized that they went up in they
then wrote something like inspired and
then that item was inspired vibe but I
just think that it a bit so yeah that
was one thing that I noted however the
good thing on the website they did have
actual customer reviews and a lot of
them I did think were genuine because
there are a lot of people having a
little moment like this item does not
look like this but make my order price
of the good price and affordable and
spent 300 lemuel as well I spent three
hundred and forty two dollars and I was
able to get 21 items now further piece
of drama was a case of when I made my
order and it all works fine then after I
started to get these emails from
customer service they created a ticket
from SACEM support and they're like we
need you to provide more identification
information so they wanted photographic
identification I got to know there's too
much you're asking for too much bro if
you actually just a swimsuit they're
like a passport photos or a driving
license I was like and you know when
everything in your head is screaming
scan scan scan scan scan scan like oh
but you want my parcel you all my
driver's license I bet no you are asking
too much and then also like a piece of
like evidence of your address so
something like a deal and I was like not
for us and Sudan is like it's just too
much
and partly realizes probably that
potentially that people buy stuff that
using other people's cars or that some
kind of thought that people might have
done so they have to protect themselves
but a lot of people are worried that
exactly the scan website taking people's
data
and I was a little bit is it is it is it
not especially after I got that email
and I got it like three times I'm I
ignored it no one's getting my passport
details okay okay anyway then I got
another one from and they asked me
something else it was to do with if
we're not as you're not at home
we'd be happy for us to leave early or
something along those lines or which I
responded yet and then I went ahead and
it shipped out I did not give them any
additional information like my personal
details but do anything like that and I
still receive my items however drama
number four I only received half of my
items so currently and this review is
for seventeen of the items versus the 21
I since I've got a lot one parcel I do
not know where the other parcel is hmm
it might be on hold somewhere something
somewhere also I don't know if you guys
can see this but look so I've got to pay
customs duty and that and I do not know
how much that is going to cost me at
least I think it's 18 pounds and I've
got a text message about that so yeah it
hasn't been a smooth process I'll give
you that but let's try the clothing
let's see we're saying it's a scam
okay so first item is this
off-the-shoulder rib property so citizen
so I'm just doing that lazy brush
dressing off the shoulder root this is
actually nice it's 14 pounds and $14 49
and it look really small like it would
fit a baby out of the bag but overall
this actually looks good on I'm not
sorry there will be dancing if I look
good in item but I do I do like this I
think it was killed
it is just but I'm obsessive of shows of
shoulder clean you can tell this looks
this looks cute these are slightly
hanging on by a thread here but let's
try it on let me tell you the price as
well it's a bit of a struggle get in it
I feel like the items are quite small
which isn't great for women who have got
a bit more curves and stuff like that
it's a true though
a lie I love the color I think it's a
door business or 12 my email I might
have matter if it's a nice crochet
it's even got a bit of elastic here so
it doesn't just you know constrict you
some thoughts been put into it again
it's one size oh so if you're not a
small this is math for you but yeah okay
so my offshore table session continues
this is the pink one side off the
shoulder top its 1099 now back is the
bargain because I just bought a very
similar top from pretty little thing and
in the orange and that was 10 pounds or
12 pounds so this is basically cheaper
than that and I feel like this one's
slightly better and this is this right
now literally you probably need to have
quite small bruise to this and be quite
small and I'm actually quite a small
person so that you are bigger than me
then this isn't going to work we've
still got bra coming out at the bottom
as well to me this is actually better
than the pretty little things one which
is quite subside when I feel like the
elastic on this is nicer the style is a
bit nicer the material seems to be a bit
nicer I'm kind of liking it like I don't
know how listen there's room there's a
room but visit to butter that's like nah
it's a bit too it's a bit too small for
me hold on if I pick my bra life is a
little group you know if you're trying
to be like a model hey hey what the
headline oh right the next I bought this
two-toned maxi dress size medium and $17
99 and yes while it's so damn three
cheese's okay it's crisscross in the
back that's what I really liked about it
and it's a maxi dress honestly this
looks cheap any f is no need for it to
be as crease as it is and yeah it's no
yeah right
I don't even
oh god of the house I look like I should
be part of the Amish like what what the
hell is this dress this looks like the
church dress is my mom used to put me
into the kid that I would actually cry
about wearing have a look at the back
the back is why I bought I saw the bat
look cute but the front I look like a
nun like what this this has gotten no
swag this is just grotesque the vision
is that the goal not so smashed and this
is literally sunset orange with her lips
more like a knife like brown really cute
color this is orange on the website and
color looks like it this kind of color
this is literally orange an orange bin
liner and orange bin liner this is awful
so I had looked at that dress and I've
got received if I would be pissed
actually pissed like this is a joke oh
where you ask you to do just go together
my horse okay so where I feel like I
need a horse and a car or a lobster ship
now just it's all known it's all know
next up is this and chances floral
jumpsuits lip it looks always - it looks
cute and yeah it's a little jumpsuit 16
pounds for $16 49 and it looks banging
I'm seein this okay our trap okay so
this is extremely unfortunate but the
whole thing is ill-fitting the middle of
this is just a gaping hole right so boob
or no boobs this is not even
cover nipple so it's a stripe shows also
it's really tight and this is a size
medium it's very very tight on the side
and this is the ankle swingers and then
these are the trees knee grazes been
grazing my knee they're short
what is this meant to be look at it what
what are you doing
like why are you doing this you're just
you're just not here for any reason that
you're not you don't want me to be great
you just like do this actually do this
but if it does it it's virtually
snatching my growing take a peek at my
means what is it is this way it's meant
to be ask yourself this genuine question
if it's an ankle grader or the ANU
grazer what what is this why this so
short no it just doesn't fit on any part
of my body or server I cannot even do in
like I look good dancing yes oh my god
this looks cute
I like that this is a little a little
kind of roost dressed in a gray it's a
little bit shoddy there's a couple of
like loose threads but it does look kind
of cute you guys know me I like it with
a sexy little outfit so let's try it on
and see what it looks like you see my
face do you see my face okay yeah it
sure I love a little skimpy dress I'm
not gonna lie I feel like I have an
alright body and I can do a little skin
you know was coming in sick oh I mean
it's not really killing the shape but
it's helping it to containers like a
band here that's nice to feel like
that's helping to like bring me in a
little bit because when you are shame
you have to box the most important thing
is creating some form of shape in the
middle and if you guys can see they're
just loose and threading like all over
so it does look a bit cheap and funny
thing is I can find out the materials
quite nice but the material of this
dress is a nice material okay I'm off to
LA so I'm gonna wear this for my Rodeo
Drive
this is a high crop flower one size 1199
and it is been AF can this even be
ironed I feel like if you put an iron on
it with milk let's try on anyway this is
a hundred percent what were you thinking
kind of outfit what were you thinking I
mean okay alright
it does look cute it looks alright on no
no these kind of hold big sleeves alike
really in if I had a right pair of like
leggings or trousers because look quite
it doesn't look quite nice actually
I was moaning and I like all kind of
liking it then if you can see so pin was
striped it's got like pinstripes on it
yeah it's kind of cute right okay so
what you've been waiting for
bikini working me this is a scallop
bikini it is a size medium the price was
13:49 I thought their prices strategy is
very strange it looks kind of cute I
love the burgundy color
oh it's one-shoulder let's try this on
well let's try this up okay the swimsuit
is on and I'm honestly going to say it's
really nice it feels really nice on it
fits really well
I feel super secure in the bottoms and
love the scalloped detail you guys see
it's got like this scalloping detail and
it looks really nice the bottoms fit
amazingly and I've got size medium on
and I love it I felt beautiful in
something I feel beautiful in this but
the last kind of nice that I thought I
feel very comfortable in this I wouldn't
have to be yanking bits and bobs and I
think the material was really nice as
well it feels a little bit different and
I like the way it feels I like the
texture on it Janet
I'm I'm impressed I'm actually impressed
come on ok
I would I would have wear a swimsuit
before now I'm like shaking their arms
in the swimsuit for you guys what are we
doing next
what am I going to be doing this we
don't know ok this
the mallets were in costume this is a
full-blown Sabine costume
I think this is going to look really
nice on I'm not going to isolate systems
it's abelian I said it and she said it I
was screaming karma through swim see
what you can't tell me anything
are you kidding I honestly super - I
think it looks really nice
I love the cutout detail here and saw
that it makes my body look like it has
some kind of shape listen I don't have
any shape but I do now denim shorts
honey denim shorts 1313 dollars at this
point in time I'm really wishing that
the other star had ordered come through
because I'm really feeling like the
items are kind of nice and short okay
yeah they're in a size medium they
better not give me an indent abang hope
huh no up close and personal this is I
love doing this stuff live on camera
look the whole - for the button to go
through is not open it just needs to be
cut but it hasn't been cut right well
the shorts actually fit quite well
they're giving me a minor it my my
inventive um literal if I can learn from
this I'd like you to do Ruza and plus
the whole parenting is kind of damaged I
feel like you could just put a knife or
scissors and it would open up but
they're men we also have jeans and you
know how particular I am when it comes
to the jeans size medium
these are nice they're stretchy then we
try these on I feel like they give me
hope please believe this has done it
again
there is no hole in this denim again I
will give you a pass if you do one time
but if you do it twice no you have to
get your act together that is actually
not a joke actually feel like they make
the jeans or girls who don't have much
curve especially at the back that that's
always very tight and not the way they
fit on the thighs and actually they got
the ankle right yeah
it's a good ankle it's actually a good
ankle I have this suede lace-up skirt
this is 18 dollars 99 and it not very
nice it's a skirt on and it is super
super cute anything is that it's a bit
large and I've got this in a medium and
I feel like the worst parts of sizing is
confused look at the size of this socket
literally big and it's a medium it's
cute though I was still worried about
this I'd like to put on a couple of
pounds to like figure out or just get a
little bit stitching done but oh I think
it's a nice quality skirts funny out of
this striped dress until Venice it's
literally looking like an old school
Tesco carrier bag or like you know when
you go to a beach and then you get the
beach beds that are striped that's what
this looks like it just looks like dead
but jeez this is there's no words
there's no words to describe the fryer
crustiness that you have going on but
I'm going to try one anyway okay so
government tablecloth was a trend this
would be the trend this is what you'd be
wearing wear grandma's tablecloth out
this is the dress you end up with
funnily enough and they're like the
style I surf online to myself is this
Isle okay I like the fact that it has a
little gotta grab a little legs we've
got a little leg right but we've got leg
and we've got funny
so because it's a bit mark even if it
wasn't this battle why are you going to
put a stick to the belly button so right
now I'm not going to show you but if you
don't need to see all that but if I
listen it's just all open and my sister
says sign into the wind and you like
it's actually too much this isn't just a
slip this little you just caught makeup
like this isn't just a slip this is
literally a gaping hole so I don't know
why you'd make a dress like that um yeah
that is me done okay so that is my
sample video is done I feel like this is
the icing that you guys really were
asking for and
I was kind of surprised because my
overall perspective on the items is that
there are a lot better than I thought
two minutes I thought they were going to
be crap
I thought they were going to be really
bad especially because as I mentioned my
sister made an audience order and she
was like an extra shot she didn't like
the item but she ended up still wearing
feminum on holiday anyway
and I thought they were going to be way
worse than they actually were and no
some actual gems now to me the sizing is
absolutely crazy like your medium your
small your one size you can't even
decide what size you want to be and I
feel like you have to be very careful to
make sure you pick the right item I had
a medium jumpsuit which was literally so
small they were just you know collecting
up all into areas they shouldn't be
collecting up into also add a medium
skirt which was far too large and I mean
I feel like some of it just wasn't great
oh no I didn't feel like the clothing
was good I did feel like the swimsuits
were very very nice that that might be
their strong point so my opinion is that
you know if you're going to go ahead and
try some swimsuits and that'll
definitely try that do not waste your
money on the clothing to be honest with
you because it's hard to hit or miss the
denim and no as I like these websites
with Dennis of people with literally no
bond like it's virtually like if you had
a prune for a brand sure go ahead onto
the Apple and purchase your jeans better
but if you've got anything bigger than
the prune then yeah it's not going to be
for you oh well I feel like the process
of hats or I felt unsure on the website
no good that's the worst thing you never
want to feel unsure when you're
purchasing and I definitely felt unsure
but there were definitely some good
items there do not give your passport
details or your driving license or
anything like that if you get any email
just ignore that and see what happens
and also been mentioned I still do not
have the other half of my orders and
this is four weeks linters so yeah I
mean so most of the times women as I
heard
I cut them up on spinning them back so
I'm not going entirely broke buying
these items well I really want you guys
to get a good idea of what's out there
and was not and I really just want to
share my honest opinion so there any
other websites want me to try any of the
clothing you want me to try here we are
let me know in the comments and I will
see you guys soon
hi another one that website that you
guys wanted me to have a look at and buy
some items from was she inside or she in
I think it might be called now listen I
spent marcroy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
