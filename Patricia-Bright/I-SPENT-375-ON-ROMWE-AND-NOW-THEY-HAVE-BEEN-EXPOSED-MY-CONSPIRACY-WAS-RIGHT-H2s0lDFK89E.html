welcome to my channel how are you doing
today
I've new luck or wet hair I just I'm
digging a little bit sexy to be honest
with you I've got my one um we got a
pink chair listen today is a new day
it's the new day okay so today I'm
excited I'm always excited but today I
read you guys's comments and I thought
that Sheehan was the most requested
I spent a video on and it wasn't I
searched for you like the comments and I
saw Rodney I had never done and I spent
a video on Romney and it had literally
two thousand comments I don't know what
you guys really wanted me to review this
site but you really really wanted it so
I went and I took my coin and I spent it
on wrong way oh okay this is heavy this
is heavy
so these are my two parcels for mommy I
do not know why they sent me some items
separately but yeah these are the this
is a big old cardboard box and it is
heavy as whatever and it you just broke
my wrist with that box it's Sophie but
that's a good size and so I spent three
hundred and seventy five dollars I'll
hold on let's just get specific because
I know nowadays people hmm people I like
to just double check you know so I spent
three hundred and seventy four dollars
19 I got shipping for free and then I
got a shipping insurance for 99 cents so
which to me that you're really good I
think it's 21 or 22 items for 375
dollars and 18 cents cuz of the 99p
shipping insurance right so I don't
think the price is too bad and I have a
little mini confessions many confessions
to give about wrongly but of course
normally I go into a little chitchat
about just my overall experience so
number one the website and I thought
once that was good
I thought the website was good sometimes
I go on some of these websites they give
me a headache I look at the
I'm confused the images are just
different colors
it's just a mess as your photos are mine
your photos there's too much Photoshop
going on it's all kinds of a mess
whereas when I went on to Romney it did
feel like a pleasurable online shopping
experience and in terms of my shipping
and delivery all right ordered on the
28th of August oh you're not table
already and okay when almost knocked
over all this in October it did take
about two two to three weeks for my
items to car obviously it's a Chinese
website so it's coming all the way from
China's I'm not expecting it to be next
day delivery I didn't get scammed
I paid by PayPal all was good I wasn't
worried about it being a scam site
because to be honest of you wrongly
isn't a new pop-up site and I know a lot
of people think new sites just come out
of nowhere back in the day I was a
Romney girl I actually checked my inbox
and saw that Romney actually subscribed
to my youtube channel five years ago and
they used to give me four items to get
four items for free from their website
as well and I could you know do my
YouTube videos and to be honest with you
my channel actually started on the whole
videos outfits of the day and
customizing clothing so there's nothing
you know different here I know a lot of
people like Patricia you change no honey
I'm exactly the same and to be honest I
didn't always love the items that they
had some of them were literally so cheap
it was like this is cheap and then some
were like really good as in some items I
had in my closet up until like my last
clear out and like this is old-school
wrong we like there's this very jacket
that I had that was so wrong yeah but
for this video I'm not sponsored you
guys know this I don't sponsor these
videos I pay for my iTunes myself my own
coin is being spent appreciate you
subscribing to my channel follow me on
my Instagram and my snapchat and my
Twitter all that stuff there but yeah I
think I'm ready to get in to this video
but here's my first set of items
they sent me three items separately I
don't know why let's check it out I love
the color
oh this is mixing it it feels really
soft feels luxurious not luxurious it
feels really my son luxurious he is no
no yes yes
overruled this is a really really nice
jumper but look at that detail nice it's
cute and it's ripped
it is rip this is $21 so mad I think I
actually bought quite a lot of autumn
items so we just going for this on
tradition and smiley like this I really
like here and they're having a moment so
I'm glad okay impress impress right next
this is a cable knit jumper this was $16
$16 80 suppose the Dukes got 56 percent
off supposedly it was 47 dollars 99 but
you know no one was spending forty seven
dollars 99 ever for this but you know
you need them with that markets employee
it's such a marketing ploy when they
tell us it was this price and now is
this price what was it that price cuz I
never saw it and I would have never paid
that price for it
oh it's nice it's kind of giving me a
little bit of a um like a doily you know
what oiling is like a grandma's doilies
it's nice but grand Marie as well I like
it but I'm not sure I feel like this
will suit some and not to others this is
great if you have a bunch baby because
it is kind of loose and it kind of comes
out in the middle so nobody needs to see
that big old tongue I mean two permits
for $60 it's not a bad jumper it's a
really nice cable knit as well I like it
but it simply said no for me it's a no
for me
okay free or trim um hello it's quite
sexy embroidered Bardot
do you not I've noticed they don't put
any labels in their clothing there's
literally not
like oh there's no wrongly tank or
anything like this I feel like it goes
with my new hair I've got a nude bra on
shoutout I think it's called Nubian skin
their bras are amazing they've got
really good colors and news for all skin
tones but yes hello this is nice I feel
like every time I pick up clothes it's
very you know Latin Lover Spanish queen
clothing I like the colors it's pretty
it's pretty pretty but to be honest to
be there isn't a lot of material there I
mean it's only like $12 it isn't
expensive at all like it's a nice piece
I don't know how to be wearing this too
but when I'm wearing it
okay I'm not sure what this is here was
this what the hell is this the hell is
this okay this is $10.50 it's the off
the shoulder asymmetric sure it's lychee
made of crepe really crappy material
just it just looks very white bin liner
I mean I'm gonna try it on
let's see this is oh this is pottery

love this skirt this is beautiful it's a
nipple sure right it is a little short

kind of cover up on the top a little bit
more I'm not mad at Oscar oh I like it

it's 12 pounds I don't let's try it on
let's see what it looks like
Hey oh gosh why is it cute why is it
cute why do I like it
why don't I think it looks nice on why
do I think if it's nice on I wanted to
hate it I think it's really nice it's
giving me very much like Ivy Park drives
but I'm not seeing this anywhere I like
it a lot of things that have a colorful
set of curves at the moment and this
that comes to and then at the net and
the mesh it's nice look make it a bit
darker so you can see look at that
is it just me who thinks this is nice
like why is it cute like this love it
actually love it okay this is a high
high slick velvet dress 16 dollars and
10 this pricing
annoying diverse we need $45 99 on the
okay well this is some woman like me a
woman like me I don't know where I
thought I was wearing this tooth do you
not I have a party I'm going to Paris
and I'm Balmain I might go wrong we
dressed her by main party that is
Patricia for you right let's try it on
mMmmm hello
you said warm unlike me would I do the
rest of this but basically it's one of
these dresses is misguided had these
last year where you can wear it in lots
of different ways twist it at the back
and twist it around here and then I
don't know what do you do with it okay
okay but what do you just do with all
the extra fabric let's go across back am
I gonna do like tie a bow here wrap me
up like a Christmas present no this
could be nicer Valentine's Day though I
love the fit I love this bit I just wish
that these bits was shorter the color is
gorgeous I don't know if you guys can
see you it I like the velvety and
gorgeous it look it looks really nice I
love the cross back and everything but
convertible dresses are not for me
because I'm lazy
this is like a romper I don't know I
don't like the word romper what's
another word I call it like a playsuit
but yeah with many places medium and it
was 1225 it's really cheap let's try
this on again I'm gonna have this sensor
again
I feel like wrap stuff I see if it's
like a low it's just not made for my
body because I just always end up with
my nipple to the wind
it's literally hello world I have
arrived
these ones are clearly arriving for the
whole world to see so we're just going
to censor I mean besides that I do quite
like the color and like the materials
like a crepe so they create material but
literally my
Paul is flying to the wind so know
Patricia is into her nets the cute
little jumper oh I like this I like this
and I love the fact that it's got this
clear thing here to help it not fall off
your shoulders I love love love this top
it is 1610 again I don't know 1680
unfortunately I got this in a medium and
it is too big oh Lord
I'll let you almost just expose myself
it is another one which is slightly
nipple to the winds it's cute I love the
flute sleeves I love the bottom but it's
just too big you need to have quite
broad shoulders I think to wear this
like broad shoulders girls unite come
this top is for you I swear I have one
of these now in every single color in
the entire world every color I need to
do a giveaway oh look there's literally
no label in there can you see that like
it should
let's just say sorrow or something or
she in or wrong way they leave it like
this and people can put their own
branding on it or they just buy it like
this and then they just sell it without
bothering to put on their own branding
to be honest this is quite shiny
although that is the trend is me you
know I thought I was put off by this
shine but I actually quite liked it it's
giving me a little Michael Jackson look
at that on it's cute oh my gosh this is
like my new everyday jacket oh my gosh I
love it you got to be stunning stuff
he's done something this jacket was $34
not bad not that at all love the color
fits really nicely I've got it in a size
medium and it's beautiful okay I just
opened this up I don't know why I bought
this oh no no I'm actually laughing and
laughing please see what they says
please that says she
listen my conspiracy is my conspiracy is
right how am I gonna just open the shut
up and it says sheen on the show she in
how you gonna write how are you gonna
make that mistake wrong we won we come
on
are they the same company is it the same
owner so many questions so many
questions
yeah this is a shot for $13 13 it's on
my order from wrong.we and it says she
in you saw it here fast people would you
saw it here first to be honest with you
I was about to say I'm not even gonna
try this show on because it's dead
cuz it is that really crappy funny
material you know I'm just going to
happen for you guys but realistically
this is one of those months when you
open it you go have another here is this
shell on it's thin it's cheap it
literally looks like nice oh nice
I knew I wasn't gonna like this shirt I
just I've just put this on for you guys
just to let you know I just don't like
it why didn't I buy these I wanted to be
cool these are really nice quality
actually now I bought like oh oh with
the shirt and the hair I could be a
sophisticated school teacher
well like the teacher you like it's cool
okay if I was your teacher I'd beat will
be friends hello goodbye what's this
hello from oh I'm feeling sexy oh yes
okay put your shell we're going from
school teacher to good about town yes
I'm something just I laugh at myself
like Patricia really I quite like this
school T I'm literally clock Padma I'm
Clark Kent I'm not going to like
journalist by day tonight
super sexy woman by night just gonna
have to just show you guys right hold on
I think it still hasn't potato
Wow okay okay
it does oh it's great
with being great together here's this
dress and we had a couple of moments
because it's see-through
don't know if you guys can see it is
like a see-through ship one but it's got
like an inside layer and then I thought
well are you going to be like
see-through on the booby and but there's
like a little bit of extra coverage on
the booby and I was and I was wearing I
thought are you gonna be a really open
deep V where my nipple is to the wind
and it didn't do that we are what we are
deep v but we are deep v I thought this
is really elegant it's got shoulder
padding in it it's got this little curl
of hair this looks more expensive than
it is
this is $26 you just need to put one on
the expensive shoe with this dress let
me come up closer you guys can see can
you see it's like chiffon here yeah I'd
like a deep V but I like a deep V that
isn't literally all the way over here oh
it's giving me curvature curvature piece
it's got this like pocket area here this
this guys this is a definition okay this
is bougie thought yes
I'm gonna wear this to Paris I'm
watching you I've just seen this top and
I don't know whatever thinking it looks
like great like early babypoo like the
color is just off-key and I was hoping
I've learned better to not get talks
that are rap open like this but let's
just see okay so I was slightly wrong I
was judgmental the top is actually quite
nice in terms of the rap not being so
low my love it the color is not my go-to
color but it doesn't actually look oh we
got but it doesn't actually look awful
on it's okay it's not awful I don't hate
it okay so I picked up this bodysuit and
I picked up these charges so I'm gonna
put them together I thought I was losing
turn why don't the heat again there's no
labels no front no back how do you even
know which side you're wearing a death
yeah I'm definitely wearing it the wrong
way around because it's just giving me a
little baggy fanny I never realize how
much stress you feel by not knowing what
was the front or the back to the top and
you know I quite like the detailing on
the side of these but the front of these
literally you guys have to see I'm just
gonna show you just have a look at this
like is this the front is this the back
should I have a bum ear Vicky's a bum
funny right here these are actually
quite nice quite like them but they're
just an ill-fitting pair of trousers
alright so this is this jumper on living
for it I'm not mad at it look at the
back do look at that that is so cute I
love the color
this website is definitely hit or miss
but I think it's if you pay a little bit
more for the item you're more likely to
get a good quality item this is really
lovely this is really me like I'm super
casual a lot of the time and I just like
I'm casual a little
details I love the little white lacing
that this has got going through it
jumper was actually $15 it was super
affordable look at that look at the
detail cute you got see that what's this
I don't know what this is oh my gosh I
do know what this is is it exactly the
same right now I'm I think that there's
a conspiracy I think she in and wrong
with other things at the same company
I'm just putting out there I think it's
the same company okay conspiracy
I did my she in all the last time and I
bought these amazing like cool up
trousers in white and I basically saw
the exact same trousers in black on the
website and I love them they they're up
they wash amazingly I've worn them a
fair few times they're definitely worth
your coin and then glittery these are
exactly the same in the black on wrong
way I think one way and seeing are the
same science I said it is it it class
all right let's try these on anyway okay
these are these trousers on they look
exactly the same as the white ones the
material is actually slightly different
but they're just they're just as cute as
I remembered and I'm glad to have them
in the black because I wore the white
ones Oh some I'd really like them really
really like them they've really put you
on there's just something about these
it's the way they fit got this like
pleating detail I find it really
flattering it's kind of loose fitting
and lovely like cropped length okay next
I'm gonna stick with another pair of
trousers yeah hmm okay I've it knees
can't decide if they're cropped or if
they're wide leg these are made out of a
very thin very thin material they're
literally so thin I feel naked these are
literally paint made of glittery tissue
paper there's no pockets
you see registers that pocket there are
no pockets on them okay
they're just not the most flattering
because I have a short toes torso
something about the stripes in the
position in I think make me look even
worse like even worse either not
flattering on me okay we have something
else striped what's this I think it's a
maxi dress this is eight dollars 75
miles per tations for this up is low
I mean for a littles like summer holiday
dress it's not bad oh it's kind of cute
it's kind of a stretchy material it's
like a stretchy maxi dress you can tie
it up here oh okay okay
bootie coming through and you see these
lines here come up yeah this is doing a
lot this is really doing a lot so nice
little maxi dress isn't it I feel like
the stripes are actually quite
flattering all of a sudden I'm a big fan
of that all of a sudden I'm a big fan of
that that's nice I love it too okay okay
lastly bits this is a leather skirt faux
leather skirt guys now I have an issue
with the shiny it's not too shiny
it's not too shiny let's try this on and
then I have another knit jump run have
another knit jumper and then I have a
jacket let's try it on this guy oh this
is the leather skull on it's a nice it's
a faux leather it is nice is cute and
then it so glad the length that is a
little bit mumsy Ike I hate this length
just above the knee has to be below the
knee or like quite short on me ten
dollars and fifty K again this looks
really nice inside being more doors it's
not a bad it's not bad sky it's not a
bad phone leather scar I've seen worse
it isn't too shiny why did I pick this
Patricia looks like it's been chewed up
by a dog this is more like what was I
thinking when I picked this I think I
really liked the back of it but there's
people at bears but it isn't it
isn't it isn't why I thought so this is
a note you guys will not believe this
you will not believe it it's a jacket
says she in it said she in how are you
just gonna drop your guard like that
runway and me I know my conspiracy is
right my conspiracy is right but is it
oh I think they are saying company this
coat is cute as well it is I love the
color
hockey bomber in style kind of sweetie
mmm we're so much better which is kind
of nice I quite like that
whether it's one week or or she in who
cares
it's still cute but I'm done it's time
for final thoughts time for final
thoughts
well people you saw it here I feel like
I've just expose a conspiracy
now all these websites are actually the
same allegedly but that being put on the
side my thoughts on the shop I thought
there was some really good items in it
to be completely honest with you it was
not as and crappy and tatty as I thought
it would be and there are some good
items that I really really like that
will be in my autumn closet and I'm
really happy with some of the purchases
the sizing is slow I have found this for
these Asian websites I always usually
get items that are a medium across the
board and we got sir pricing again you
get what you pay for avoid that items
are really cheap ignore the fact that it
was expensive and it's down by 56% it's
a marketing ploy and quite overweight
isn't bad again I do feel like the
site's been around for a long time so
you can kind of trust it I don't think
that you're gonna get scammed anything
your money's gonna go disappearing I
love that black dress I'm actually going
to wear it to something that's you know
a fabulous event I'm gonna wear it I'm
gonna walk in we're like romley dressing
but hey it's wrong we but overall I am
not mad at Romney asshole I think the
site is actually okay I'm not angry at
it and whether or not I would be
shopping there regularly that is a
different story
but I would vote
safe to purchase good items there so I
feel like we've almost come to the end
of reviewing some of these websites so
what do we want to see next
I might or wish pot two because the
other half of my parcel came and it's
they're just sitting looking at me ready
to really be delved into but if there
are any other sites any other brands any
other companies and your clothing styles
you want me to check out let me know in
the comments we're going to get the ball
rolling
did you guys agree with my conspiracy
did I make this up did you know this
already and would you spend your coin
