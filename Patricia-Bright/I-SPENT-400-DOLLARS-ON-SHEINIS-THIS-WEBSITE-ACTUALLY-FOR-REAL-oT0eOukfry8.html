life I've got something sneaky up my
sleeve BAE
hello it's nice to see you guys again
hello to everybody new as well I've had
a ton of new subscribers I appreciate
you thank you so much for coming and you
know what I'm listening to everything
you're saying I'm reading all of my
comments and girls oh my gosh thank you
for coming to the team and another one
that website that you guys wanted me to
have a look at and buy some items from
was she inside or she in as I think it
might be called now listen I spent
mother crying could you I feel like some
of you guys also want to do brokes like
my stuff every suggestion I might well
well really okay so yeah this is
performer she in and I bought a bunch of
items I spent three hundred and
thirty-eight dollars to ship in and I
got a teen item I kind of feel like it's
good I'm not going to like this box is
heavy a s they packed it intensely it is
filled to the brim I feel like I've got
some nice pieces for summer
well they look nice on the website
that's what I'm gonna say they look good
on the website we don't really know a
life well it's actually good look that's
the whole point of this video I'm going
to show you exactly what I'm thinking
about it and the funny thing is I when
I'm watching these videos I realize here
we had to eat we're all doing this in
our bedroom how many of you guys bright
ison from on my website here like what
the hell does this look like and think
to yourself what was I thinking
is it just me quick bit of feedback
because I like to give you guys a bit is
insight and then I'll give you my final
thought once I tried everything on I
bought the items about four weeks ago
now and it took about two to three weeks
for delivery
I actually shopped on my mobile and
because I was away and I did the
shopping on my mobile and actually found
that the website was really good I was
shipping and delivery
I think the shipping was free actually
because of how much I spend and it came
in about two to three weeks I also got a
$5 coupon code so hey I got fire at five
dollars because I was a first-time user
and actually I have a
confession to make these are massive
better just when I've learned that my
confession is when I first started
YouTube or and like five six years ago
the first company who actually ever set
me free items was she inside and this
was the years back and you know the
level of gasses that I had to have free
clothing items so yeah and Isis back in
you know five or 16 years ago so what I
do know that people do receive items
from brands summer paid someone off pays
I love that fast I'm you know I'm one of
the mindset that it's always telling me
they like it more than likely they do
but what they probably don't show you is
the good and the bad which is exactly
what I try to do in these videos right
okay so I think I've talked absolutely
enough y'all want to see it y'all wanna
see it okay the first item I'm pulling
out is this mustard jacket and funny
enough I picked up a mustard jacket the
last time but I took it back they didn't
like the fit so I'm hoping this one's a
better option this is I've got the price
list on there this is $40 let's have a
look at the jacket does it look good on
and my trusty mirror from Amazon for
those of you who are yes here's a jacket
okay so this jacket fits $40 on the
website although it said it was $77 I
don't know where it was sold for $77 I
know you're lying you know when people
they mark up a price and then they like
say flash card price it was never that
price to begin with in the first place
so don't lie we're not stupid but this
is - not this is no honestly this is
super - like this looks like an outfit
so this not look can al see it a little
bit hot for a jacket like this right now
but this is very nice it is but you know
what this is exactly like raisins or a
jacket hold on I have to get you my
jacket so you can see but so this is my
Zara basic jacket Zara basics it's
exactly the same style I think it's
exactly the same jacket since that same
jacket no lie okay
check exact same jacket or what actually
here it's a little bit more cop
I mean okay it's it's slightly different
so so it's not the same thing
okay now I just want to see what it
looked like in zip top this this you
need to be working are good cute very
cute a very very cute
yes actually this is better than my
garbage a kit because the arms are not
short on me Oh
- and I actually think that $40 is
reasonable I'm not angry at this I like
it okay so next up I've got this off the
shoulder sure sixteen dollars so it's
quite cheap I don't know what material
this is it doesn't feel like a normal
cotton shirt but it looks and looks
alright this looks a bit I'm going to
try it on because right now it's not
showing me anything at all this looks
like like a sexy corporate work shirt
you know like some is here and you want
to be that woman in the office a Hello
bar that's what this looks like
no lies the girl on the website is
carrying this with ultimate so as you
put sunglasses on she's like hey this is
looking a lot less swaggy up but it is a
very nice shirt for like going to work
I feel like actually if I tied it up or
just what you see
just do one transformation that cute
that is actually cute like that I think
you guys can see I'm going to bring make
it a touch darker it's kind of a really
thin pinstripe so actually a blue shirt
I know it looks kind of blue on there
but that's alright and I think you can
do this up as well as the I mean this is
taking it to Grandma's date of birth it
went from oh I sexy secretary to aunt
Doris I don't even hate it if you're
looking for work or school sure or
somewhere you have to wear uniform this
is - I would wear this in the summer
shirt I thought if this crop top shirt
it looks like a fireman's uniform I
don't know what this looks so damn cheap
it looks dead it looks dead it looks
dead off the peg let me talk moaning let
me try it on it ugly and it's
ill-fitting and the material is crap
yeah I don't like this and I like this
at all
yes I don't like it that's what I'm
going to say maybe hmm okay so next up
is this dress and off the back it is
just giving me cheap vibe is $23 it's
just very stretchy and bouncy you know
sometimes when the material isn't right
you feel like it's not going to fit well
off the back of light what the hell this
doesn't look any good so we're going to
be on mmm it's fitting snug hmm it's
hitting like a girl right now okay oh oh
oh you see where a hello darling it's
giving me pussy you guys know I'm too
shaped for the front and it goes like a
rectangle my tree like this bit doing a
little bit of snatch but oh I'm feeling
very I got really good point you say to
myself I said I kind of really good nice
dress I feel like it looks a bit tacky a
little bit but actually it doesn't look
tacky on it looks okay listen yes but by
fooling it's tiny okay okay okay my back
up something like I've been doing
exercises what
wow it's creating a booth I'm not going
to talk about to create an illusion you
know
oh come on come true yeah I'm I'm
realizing this price and my body is
looking like a million dollars I love
this you know what I feel bad cuz I was
just getting the material but it's kind
of cute next up I have this dress here
twenty six dollars off the shoulder big
sleeve item it looks cute on the girl I
don't know if this is really going to
suit me and what I'm going to try it on
and then
see where that side okay I mean this is
kind of giving me a bit Little House on
the Prairie
but this is a nice little Sun like a
sundress it's cute I like it like the
shoulder
I like this ruching here it fits really
well so like I've got good amount and
support like I don't necessarily need a
bra this is quite a thin cotton and hold
on what is that do you see that there's
like some stitching that is stuck it
together you see it right there how it's
like sticking out that is a
manufacturing fault it's not on this
side definitely not on this side hold on
it make it darker it is clean see how
it's like sticking out there look
there's like stitching that has been
done wrong there wanna see that is that
is so strange
but overall the dress is nice I just
hope this isn't a fault with all of the
dresses and I hope it's just with this
one dress actually like this so simple
anymore
I might wear this out today sure that's
against after we're even with a salt
this dress is called the sweetheart
dress it was $17 and if you can see the
detail and that's kind of cute it's
probably a bit bright let's just make it
a bit darker it looks kind of cute I
love the sleeves on the model like she
looks a really nice wearing it for $17 I
think it's actually a bargain I'm not
even angry at that at all so I'm going
to try it on bitsy kind of looking like
a muumuu put them into the pillar
this is the kind of dress like one
second you like it and one second you
don't this is a nice fun dress or like
if I want holiday or something or you
know going to the beach this is a nice
dress just to throw on on a very hot day
it's kind of itchy though and if you
have you know when you're younger I did
it when I was younger my mom used to
always put on in flowery dresses
literally to go to Tesco
would be in one big ballgown dress you
to call them ball gown dresses and on
the inside they would itch like heck
they would have this there's something I
don't know what it is but it's
hurt you put my owner put my arms down
it hurt this has the same thing I can
feel that itchy scratch things this is
looking like plastic this is about
plastic woven together look at this
loose threads here just loose cotton
wall it just seems a bit shoddy okay
next up we're here in the denim
department
these are $22 nudists skinny jeans
skinny jeans where it says $22
not bad for jeans however is very thin
very very thin size medium I got but to
me this is looking quite wide on the
waist anyway I did check the sizing
because them the last time I got sizing
so wrong but yeah I did check the size
in let's see let's see what it looks
like on if it's really tight on the side
but big enough here look that to me the
bottom of jeans is extremely important
and you need to be a skinny you don't
need to be a flare and you don't need to
be a tramp this is actually looking like
a child player I will show you right now
please look at the bottom of these what
is this you are meant to be skinny and
you are dancing in the air I shouldn't
be able to do this for the skinny jean
this is a no from me this is a
deal-breaker with a jean it needs to be
like that
skinny jeans trumpet Jean and a next
item is big piece of denim here what why
hello
I mean I love a long dinner jacket
please I always said end up picking one
up right but it doesn't need to have a
big hole in the back like that and this
is $30 I like that that the sleeves are
mounted oversized yes that is all me
lover knows if I sneeze and I roll it up
it's not sick denim definitely not sick
dinner my fist add a really nice jacket
and new one from Zara which is well
isn't super thick but that cost 50
pounds so this is a much thinner version
of denim which could be nice for lights
of Samarra I think it fits not
actually I'm in the market for an
oversized and Jeske it isn't bad
now this losses on the back I don't know
what that is there but maybe we're
trying to take denim extreme then yeah
so I don't hate it but you know when you
just get like a breeze I just chill in
your back you might end up with this but
that's like it okay so this is another
what were you thinking Patricia what but
this looks like a genuine my mum's
cutting my mom's cotton in the inner top
I don't know what I was thinking forgive
me and yeah I'm going to just twist $23
for cotton no I mean that's my fault
this is a bad pit this is honestly a
very bad thing this is just this respect
ceremonial where Oh what this is so dead
my fault entirely this is just dead hold
it I think I need to do that it's got
like flat I need to do the Nicki Minaj
thing hold on what is it this is how
bear is wearing mom's Curren some of
y'all don't even know how to spell
Curtin I'm actually ashamed of myself
really okay this top here people this
top is nine dollars I love it already
nine dot yeah okay so this top here I
think I've got an embroidery thing going
on this cop is nine dollars I'm not even
mad for a little summer t-shirt this is
cute and you feel like you know you
bought something you know it's not the
most expensive item in the world you
know your work for summer
now this is what I'm talking about I
think it's super cute I think I look
really nice with some denim shorts I
haven't got anything bad to say about it
yeah okay next item are these they're
short they're short coming to the short
crossing I love me some booty shorts
like this these are $16 so when the
front of these shorts are cute I love
that shape they look cute they're
high-waisted like look highways cover my
baby button and my stretch mark
I always love that
that from the back Wow
like and I'm just going to come in it is
a sorry sorry state of einen board but
Affairs like if literally what I call an
indenter bum which is on the bongos in
this is giving me and along a long
indent of like dead that is despised
that is just so ugly but it's not I have
this shirt this shirt is $23 and I
really liked this shirt because it's
basically a copy a dupe of the
self-portrait shirt which is over 200
pounds and it looked really good on the
model it's like this off-the-shoulder
stripe shirt it's filled in market quite
nice cotton it goes nicer than some of
the other fabric I've tried on yes let's
get this on and see what it looks like
oh my gosh this is cute I really like
that this is so nice I feel like it
looks more expensive than it is this is
like a 30 pound shirt and it feels nice
I feel like it will wash roll it will be
creased up go to work go to school that
is a good job of these bosses of the
face by the way I'm going to try and
unbutton it if they're not real I picked
up these pleat trousers I've already put
makeup on them I think pleat white
trousers I feel like you can't see the
detail but it's got tiny little pleat
and they look really nice and this is
what feels quite heavy and quite
stretchy it was very nice I can't wait
to try this on very nice very very very
nice and angry this but no look at it
look at these do then on the quite
expensive do they not look quite
expensive they look gorgeous
I'm short oh my god I've got an outfit I
can wear ah ah yeah
I actually need them in every color to
ever get that one item you like you know
what this thing could be my entire
wardrobe these are stunning
the material is 10 out of 10 rockets
let's not push it 9 out of 10 these are
9 out of 10 okay so I picked up some
bikini items as well
I feel very medium uncomfortable with
putting a bikini on on YouTube it's
quite nerve-wracking on the beach okay
and a resort I don't care but so when
you're putting yourself out on the
internet it's a bit like nerve-racking I
really what a shit okay I'm going to
show you guys I'm going to show you guys
oh oh my gosh how good does that look
so I even see like all my boobs and
everything I'm really really nice really
really nice it feels very comfortable as
well and that came well supported
whenever I wear a crochet bikini and you
never know what it's going to feel like
but because this isn't all crochet it's
got Anna Preem here and there's got this
crochet detail which I actually love
overall I was definitely wearing I think
it looks really cute um I like it I
think it's cute okay honey that is my
she and video done what did you guys
think I feel like it was a mixed bag I
feel that when you shop you want you
know you never going to get everything
being amazing but what you want to be
sure of is is the confidence of the
quality that you get and I feel like
Russia and expect hit or miss like some
items are amazing and you know the
skating is it's not because of the price
so the $10 item that looks really cute
on or a nine dollar icing that was
really nice and so I'm gonna $30 was
like really so you can't really tell
because of the price but overall I feel
like it's a mixed bag if there was a
certain particular style or trend you're
a star I would be open to but I feel
like it may be better to find an item a
bit closer to home I liked it something
that you really really want
I thought the website was good I thought
the customer service was good in regards
to like getting the emails and updates
also I've got some coupon codes
afterwards I don't hate it at all I
think it's okay
it wouldn't be my go-to site but overall
I thought it was okay there's some
really nice items I actually love those
trousers I tried on stunning the jacket
stunning the bikini stunning so yeah so
