where you see pigs on the internet
doesn't mean that they're for you but
look at that side detail this it's so
hard to just because honest as possible
without being offensive hello beautiful
people welcome to my channel I was gonna
say I'm excited like I always am which
is what I usually say but today I'm not
actually excited
the reason I'm not actually excited
because this is what most videos that
I'm really doing because of you guys not
because I want to because my experience
wasn't absolutely amazing I'm hoping
that you know we're shot able to rectify
their life after I do this video however
you know we don't really know how it's
gonna go down today I am doing a follow
up to my first wish
I spent a video on it was kind of epic I
spent about 400 pounds on wish why I
never knew anything about which I didn't
know anything about wish other than I
saw you guys in my comments with my
check out wish and then all of a sudden
I kept seeing wish verse everywhere as I
hold on I might late to the party or
something so anyway did the video we got
three million views on that video people
and I'd be honest of you only half of
the order came so the last couple of
weeks and months the rest of the orders
have been coming in this is the bag with
all the rest of the every individual
order come in from wish and there's like
warm
there's like all of this okay
when I first ordered from wish I didn't
have a clue what the website was I
didn't know anything now I have a better
understanding of what wish is so when
she is kind of like eBay it's an online
store with different sellers which is
why each individual item you have or
that I ordered how different like all
the times and then also each individual
item had different delivery prices as
well so literally every time I door
buzzing ding dong ding dong like going
mad it's like wish wish wish wish like I
swear there's like 12 orders here that's
the time that the postman has come to my
house he knows my name he see me
wigglers he's seen everything at this
stage and like though is another parcel
from wish so what I see if it's any good
if we like it we like it oh oh a good
thing a good thing right which you guys
taught me and you guys are like if you
find an item in it in it suitable you
can message them and they will refund
you your order so I haven't actually
done that but I'm going to do that this
time if there's some items here that are
just absolutely rubbish and also a lot
of people told me that which is good for
some things and not others so like
accessories unique items phone cases or
that kind of stuff but I love my fashion
and I love my accessories so I wanted to
try out the fashion we're about to go in
here go into a wish party hopefully this
collection is a little bit more
fantabulous by the way before you keep
watching or log off please make sure you
are subscribed and make sure you follow
me on my social which I have down below
and then we're just gonna get into this
video okay first item look so dinky Oh
okay some sunglasses these are cute
little pair of sunglasses these
sunglasses were 1 pound 90 pounds you
got whoa for what Pat my ear I'm having
the best day ever
listen what and I know I don't know if
these are gonna protect me from the UVA
UVB ray you know actually protect my
eyes from the Sun but they look nice so
you know it's okay okay this is cute
right I don't know what
says it's kind of fruity actually okay
this is cute let me try on let's see I
won't see like what had happened was
well Wow
that I've just got trusty memory back in
yeah this top has given me full-blown
breast exposure most people's nipples
are around here I've got nipple covers
on okay but this is all mesh here so
right through that little hole
most people's nipple will be like coming
all the way out even if you have like
really swore no breath your nipple would
come breath right out of that hole there
what's crazy that this top has the
potential to be a nice top but it's like
it's made long and OH unless this is the
this might be the back let me check
maybe oh oh I think it's the back I was
so hasty I was so hasty this is what the
front looks like although is again it's
quite thin me too but it isn't bad oh my
gosh I'm sorry Patricia always remain
impartial but the back is cute you know
what dumb I have to edit this out
Patricia you are actually just rude the
back is cute don't wet the top back to
front
I don't hate the top oh okay this these
smell like Beach little bleach bleach
wash denim literally literally bleach to
Venus I'm actually scared to have these
touch my skin I feel like I'm going to
turn into a lizard or something yeah
then they'll meet him but they're
massive so what's crazy
okay they're a medium but an Asian large
but the sizes of Keith I don't find them
and they're not amazing that we fit in
anyway and my butt looks like a pancake
in them so they're just a no all around
and yes I have stretch marks on my belly
I had a baby okay
aha oh yes
I bought some gym leggings I remember
this on my order hey these are a size
medium okay so the gym leggings they
cost four pounds let's try them on let's
go show you these on these are the gym
leggings on they've got enough they've
got some baggage here some extra baggage
heads I've got a couple of folds giving
me a complete camel however they're not
the worst I feel like I just need one
size smaller
but those he'll not be squatting in them
they're not bad they're actually a
really cute print but like the print on
these is really really cute yes this bit
here this region is pensioner fanny
is this gonna be mean but you're just
looking for something cute with a cute
print it's alright I just get smaller
sizes required okay okay let's put
little trousers some trousers material
isn't bad the material is not all for
I'm not gonna be a proper hater on this
because it isn't bad material at all I
mean all of this it fits quite nicely I
like the paper bag wasting everything I
want to be nice but the the leg is quite
short unless that's the look maybe
that's the look
yeah this is enough for me this one was
actually packaged really nicely so
basically this is a black put another
pair of black trousers okay let's see
how this is gonna roll are they eat
rousers or then then make a black pair
of leggings I don't know it if you like
this when you were younger when I was
younger I used to go to like the market
to buy craving and you know
that the phaser people wore clothing
with like Chinese writing on it it had
my it was like white we've read the
black Chinese writing of it and it was
made out of this like stretchy crepe
crappy material this is what this is
made out of but it's cute and it's got
some stretch and if we liked it would
make your body look lit so hopefully not
gonna lie these are cute
they are giving me thicker they're
giving me Shay I love what they've done
with this stitching at the back here
it's quite nice you know all those other
pockets and everything it's all for show
it's all fish like this is not an actual
pocket this is not actually an actual
zip these are not real buttons or
anything this is giving me nice shape
but I don't feel like I need the pocket
whoa yes what is this what is this they
created a monster over here what is this
I have to show you the back can you see
what they've done with the stitching
here they look I want to bring in so you
can see like the stitching is like
really curved like the pockets are
curved and it's giving me like all kind
of shape hey I like that I like the way
this looks okay something keeps as you
can tell I really did buy this stuff for
like summertime it's all very bright and
pink you know what when they say
imitation is the best form of flattery
they imitate it but it's not flattering
me telling you so I'm looking at my
order and I'm trying to find where I
bought this and if this item is the item
I think it is they're taking the piss
they're taking the pig because this is
so far so far from the image I'm gonna
try this on I will only know when I've
done the rest of my order but I actually
have a feeling it is this dress then I'm
gonna put a picture of here and they
they just this is made of silicone I
don't know what to describe it it's made
of just a vinyl I can't explain it that
dress looks so girls and this dress
looks so too
words words this is the dress this is
the dress which is basically a shiny
orange e/m peach the other dress it
looks like it's a nice cotton body
cotton stretch with the same kind of
wrap but they made it out of material
which they found in a dumpster they put
the NS manufacturer of this as a school
project I've thinned the seat from
material because my bum is on the show
right now you know you can see it all
this is grumpy Pat right now by the way
this is five pounds so I'm not out here
like breaking the bank so it's okay it's
five pounds and it's it looks like it's
five pounds this was nice hello this is
nice at you know minute I bring my
pretty prints and for holiday I could
wear this this is eight pound it kind of
smells like a curry shop but I mean I
like curry so whether or not I want make
clothes that's more like that that's a
different question but it's not all for
let's try it on I like this I is a bit
this is it it's a little sexy I mean I
don't quite I don't know why the bottom
is so small this is cute though I'm
gonna wear this on holiday it's got a
little bit of thread like just a little
frayed in places right there like some
thread hearings and threads here and but
I don't I think it's a cute style for
eight pounds I'm not mad at that I am
NOT I am not mad yes let me bring this
in let me show you guys the detail discs
it's so cute
okay come on is that not pretty you can
probably see how all the thread is like
coming out right here I have I would
wear this from holiday this is like a
little holiday beach piece I'm gonna
wear this uh-huh Nick thinks you're
really since for eight pounds I'm not
mad yes and you see how it's doing this
it's just gonna give me the waist where
there isn't a waist us to shape girls no
we need to create illusion this goes in
this goes out

are looking up here yes that's very
hating them as well doesn't smell this
is like a nice little plain little top
it looks chronic cute I want to try this
on just lay your basic honestly guys
this is beautiful it's just a little
basic but it's really nice like just
casual I've got it here with my the fake
trousers and it's actually made of quite
a nice material I feel like this would
wash really no well it's kind of like
cotton and something mmm it's good even
the little casual work or college top
yes what there you have got to be
kidding no it's not it's really not what
the hell is this
you know these are perfect for Halloween
for you I don't celebrate Halloween for
those of you who do this because this
just scared the hell out of me this is a
pair of slippers I saw these on my wish
website and I thought it was a joke
I used my actual coin and I bought these
it was how much they cost
please believe that these slippers are
the most expensive thing on my entire
order they are 15 15 pounds and 20 pence
for fish slippers if it was a joke it's
a real thing don't your Halloween party
Veronese honestly you know what for the
front of it I'm just gonna try them on
but no they're so often but look at the
slippers people for 15 pounds for fish
slippers I didn't think it was a real
thing and it really is it's really real
honestly honestly truly honestly truly
not gonna lie though they're kind of
comfortable like the inside is super
squidgy and
scales kind of feel like a massage why
put your shell
why okay Komachi company's still wearing
the slippers because they're actually
kind of cute on however we're just gonna
go to the next item
okay it's a little place suit this is
this is nice let's see what this looks
like on so the loophole just really
small curating very frustrating hey we
did it we did it
I feel like a grown-up baby in this
outfit it looks cute on the girl but I
look it's not a bad romper though the
material is really nice the stripes are
cute but no okay
oh this is a swimsuit okay is it
swimsuit is this tied it's on okay so
this is the suit on it's actually really
nice you guys are very self-conscious
about being in the swimsuit on YouTube I
don't know why it's just a bit weird but
it's cute this is really nice it's
really thick swim material like it's
even like double layered in on the
inside and it is giving me hold like
super super hold but it's really nice on
I'm like oh hello swimsuit
very very nice it fits really well it
isn't showing too much we obviously have
some boobage area here but it's not like
over boobage it's eight pounds I think
it's really good look at that side
detail this is an excellent swimming
costume excellent and it's kind of a
glossy black it's like shining shining
shining moon shining all of this women
love it this is my kind of swim question
no good my denim jeans xxx large I
didn't order xxx large why is it x-x-x

if these are a good pair of chances
because they're literally xxx large and
I didn't order xxx large I ordered
medium on my order this is Patricia
being grumpy this is me coming up to
customer service and say excuse me
customer service I made an order however
it is not the right order they look dead
anyway
okay we got some more pants all right so
these are these on although they're not
the sweat material thought they were
they don't look awful
at least they touch from an ankle and
they've got nice pockets on the side
they're definitely not made that wet
material but then there's no look bad
oh my bone was depressed my brother
actually looks depressed what's this
it's got like literally in dental right
here inverted triangle
okay this is my faux leather I feel like
I'm gonna be as high as a kite
after this video because there's a lot
of chemicals I'm gonna leave this shower
the chemicals Wow Wow
don't sniff the clove in people don't
sniff wash the clothing don't sniff it
but and then I'm gonna try it on with
this shirt that I also bought okay all
right so the shirt is actually quite
nice it's just very see-through
very-very see-through so you might need
to have like a little vest underneath Oh
tuck tuck that ish in I am giving you
corporate sexy woman vibes yes this is
me when I used to work in banking people
all of the ideas I I know they arrived
means building the scott is really nice
4 pounds the Scott is really nice

whatever this is is bright bright cobalt
blue mmm
lychee is fluorescent lace up front
funny trouser
listen there's this criss cross section
right at the front here no what you're
doing is just drawing lots of attention
to your vagina region isn't that high no
no no well this is no look this is not a
look have a look at this let's just you
want this much would you want this much
attention being drawn to your regions
I don't know thanks oh it's crazy oh
it's creating a gathered bag in that
region
No oh this I know I bought this I don't
know where they sent me to I think I
might've bought a black and a gray okay
so I bought this rumpa because I thought
was Tammy having brown eye one day I saw
her in this photo
I liked her butt cheeks were in this
romper then they looked really cute and
like it looked beautiful
it looked too on her butt I look like a
grown baby I look like an adult baby in
this and it's a big white where you see
things on the internet it doesn't mean
that they're for you you do not need to
go and do them now this only cost 470 so
I feel like this is nice to wear in the
house that where no one's going to come
this is like a little romper that you
can wear to bed or in your house but do
not wear this out of doors never out of
doors finally we have this but what's a
dress okay cute little suede dress and
it's in brown I love the color brown it
was is 5 pounds it's 5 pounds is it cute
on there catching a lot of side boob
it's a it's a little skew whiff it's
cute and I like the principle of it the
back is like this like lace up detail
which is quite nice I like the color I
like the principle of the dress it's
just a bit ill-fitting right we've got
nipple cover coming out
on the side here it's a pretty dress
it's a really pretty dress if it fit
well if it fit in all the right places
it would be like really really nice and
then like this just all fit in a lot
better you know as you can see my nipple
covers are coming out because yeah and
if I turn to the side swing literally
breasts to the wind I'm done let's have
some final thoughts okay so final
thoughts as I sit here in my wish a good
days I feel like which is a great sight
to get some you know one-off novelty
items accessories phone accessories all
that kind of stuff and I know they do
these like secret boxes or something
along the lines of that you get free
items or these jets so I feel like when
it comes to waste for clothing you
really have to be take your time and
think about it you have to read the
reviews you have to double-check the
seller do not take those pictures as
Bible okay
now the good thing is that obviously the
prices are quite low the prices are
around five pound six pound one pound
zero one point ninety two bonus the
clothing is no different from market
store items but market I actually doing
that that going to the market is that
she's safer because you can go back to
the market store man and be like mate
come on my knight takes on backwards
something like that I don't know so yeah
I might try some other bits and bobs so
people have been telling me about makeup
and brushes and all this other jazz so I
if you guys want me to check out leave a
thumbs up and leave a comment follow me
on my Instagram let me know I will do
that right I will check out for you guys
but for me to do another clothing haul
from wish it's not gonna happen
it's just not gonna happen and someone
else told me the great thing about wish
is that if you have a problem with the
item you can request a refund so I'm
going to refund everything so yeah I
think that that is an extensive review
of which I really don't offend anyone I
don't even know if any wish like I feel
like they sometimes might see my videos
and I'm just now oh it's so hard to just
because honest as possible without being
offensive so yeah that's that's my final
thoughts on wish and again I will try
something other goodies so let me know
any other sites you want me to try out
anything else you want me to you know
give you an idea of and I might do
actually something a little bit more
actual style related so if you guys are
following me on my Instagram my Twitter
my blog is well my snapchat I do more
like outfits I'm really really into like
clothing that but yes I look amazing in
it snatch a lot of items you see in the
haul is well you can see how I wear them

of stuff I'm uploading on Tuesdays
