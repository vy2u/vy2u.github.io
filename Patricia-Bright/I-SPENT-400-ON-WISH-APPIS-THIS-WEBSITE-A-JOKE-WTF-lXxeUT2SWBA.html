is so far from the reality it's annoying
me actually whenever guys welcome to my
channel today wishing on a star I wish
upon the treaty today we vote your
wishes have come true and today I am
reviewing wish we stock car and I'll be
honest with you I feel like this fight
has been like emotional question threat
to me to actually do it open a video on
and you know I took my coin and I spent
some money on this most random website
and I'll be honest with you I've never
heard of this website before so it was
literally related in my comments but to
review wish and also reviewed everything
five pounds which I might do at some
point in time and then I bet you know
what let me go check out this website
Matt you've seen a few people you know
review it I'm not okay this is actually
a thing and when I went onto the website
I'm confused because I could see things
for one pound for parachute and three
pounds for a dress so this is a one
dollar two dollars ten dollars five
dollars for my American people all I
know is that it seems to be dirt cheap
and then what it also shows is how many
people also want that dirt cheap item
and then the images are not it's not
consistent like it clearly isn't a
branded website they just like called
images from all over and put them
together to create this website and so
like issuing on me that is that what you
see or there is it necessarily what you
feel like you're going to get when it
arrived our web drop for the prices of
one pound two pounds I'm willing to try
it a little bit but don't get it twisted
and this is what I will tell you now is
that you might think that you're
spending two pounds on an item or five
pounds on an item but then they add the
ship in to every single item so your
basket will say total costs of 100
pounds and then your shipping will be 70
pounds so it's always the same
the price of the item that's what I
meant is when I was buying on the
website so you have to realize that so
that each every single item they add
shipping and the shippin could be three
pounds or four pounds or something like
that and I notice that being the case so
I ended up spending that let me consult
some I wish account my total item cost
was 217 pounds because I bought a
leather item and then my shipping cost
was 96 pounds so it was a total of 313
pounds which is probably about 400
dollars of which yeah and then Patricia
gets a bit gas when she's doing these
videos please and it's okay go follow me
go find me then in the goodbye my lunch
and how much just by my watch okay don't
don't funny they're sending money okay
please so I sent 313 pounds and yeah
this is being a like updating your
basket you like yeah it's affordable and
they're like hold up and how we're going
to make sure 100 pounds on top of this
listen anyway also I noticed that you
might find the same item for a different
price a different of like three pounds
four pounds I didn't know why that was
then if this is an auction I don't know
how it works I don't know where my my
Bianchi went to and you know how average
it I can see this is how I will say that
I received my items and so far most
funding has occurred so with good or max
run and my second thing when it comes to
delivery if you find a lot of items your
doorbell is going to be ringing
every single day because each item has a
different delivery day so one day I'll
just get these three parcels then I'll
get one parcel then nothing for an
undated
of two parcels so and you don't know
that coming I get a text message from
Royal Mail right you have a delivery on
the way I'm living in my house like
honestly these are all the individual
parcels
literally so that's a little bit
annoying and then also you might get a
delivery day of seven days you might
have a delivery day of a month and a
half because I ordered on the 27th of
June and some of the items are not going
to come in to the 22nd of September so
yeah you'll only know when you put it in
your basket on how long my shipping
dates going to be so that's the teasing
that I found but overall my expectations
are not high and I bought some items
that seemed a little bit fun but let's
just go in and try on some items from
wish and see what we think okay so you
might have noticed that my drawing is
different
unfortunately the stripes floor is no
longer with us though our IP stripe is
law clothing in with this castle here I
don't know what in what because it just
comes as it comes it comes in a plastic
packaging this is an oversized jumper
and this cost eight pounds it doesn't
look as cool as the jumper in this shop
but it kind of looks in enough let's try
it on I think it's cute actually do you
think it's nice I'm sighs it's kind of
see-through though if you can see those
my my granny panties are kind of on the
out here but it might've got this
behavior here it's great a is not like
proper knit material but it seems like
okay with knit material don't have much
stretch in it it's nice it's just a
little bit baggy and nobody will lose
its shape very easily the stitching is a
little bit school with I mean if you
guys can see you know it's just a little
bit like you know when you feel like
it's going to split if there's like
looks like it was split just there it's
not bad it's a nice oversized jumper
first oversized jumper dress it just
doesn't look it doesn't look fantastic
it definitely doesn't look fantastic
let's see what we've got next this is a
sexy shoulder flesh need and it was four
pounds let's try it on
it actually looks like odd but this is
this is one of those items that looks
nice and fast let's pass apart from nice
you know they have that statement about
girls or guys and it looks nice over
here what it literally looks like what
some are made in textiles colors you
know where you're like 16a make your
first top this is what this looks like
it is cheap so if you're looking for
something quick and fast and cheap and
affordable then you know this is an
option I think it looks kind of cheap
that's the skit that's the thing that's
scary one is in the call right from far
yes for full time I'm not mad at that at
all okay what is it hold it oh oh good
can I was crazy right the cameras making
mean items look like they're good
they're not so I just want this is some
random cultural appropriation this is
one African style dashiki and this is in
maths in scuba material this is that
material that you actually just want to
be like why right but other thinking is
looking nice and printed trust me up
here this is paper paper thin it's
making it's annoying me actually
annoying me and even the model on the
website or where she's holding a pocket
every where are you going with it but
why it's not hard for it to have a style
to it let's just put this plastic defeat
here and it's plastic this is like can
you deny that material like I can't even
explain it
whoa what is this just just what is this
man the fact that please make this out
of plastic right the fact that it is
just like plate to Shiki print and the
fact that we have a tail we at the end
tail and the fact that it looks good on
this camera in this river and I can
idiot like an actual idiot like where
are you going your ear may teacher and
your cape whether a cape whether it came
with the rest of this no I am sorry for
offending anybody I mean even my own
people dude with the culture just a
gotcha this was um seven pounds listen
and own spent 7/10 on this this is a
four pound 75 rock heart
it actually looks cute and it's actually
the same print because I was looking let
Rasmus that's not real it's a but
actually it might actually be real so
let's put this romper on okay so this is
this romper not all fully fitting I had
one for breakfast
worse than this again the materials
paper thin paper-thin the stitching is
er lychee I think if this stitch goes
right here
this picture goes is over the game is
over your meeting you're just making
everything to expose it isn't bad though
if you havenõt we have a summer holiday
or something and you need a little
something it's not awful this bit is
gaping and give me full-blown breast
exposure which isn't ideal this is made
out of the same material that they make
tencel you know that material that has
ten knowing you get a blow-up ten this
same materials don't know what they call
it
exactly the same this item is not the
same item as the item on the website the
our mobile website has like a little
flap at the front this doesn't have that
and I thought the print was the same it
isn't the same it kind of looks like the
knockoff version of whatever I'm seeing
on the website I'm actually looking at
the action on the website I feel hard
done by because this is not doing that
and I know that I could hold a let's try
to sit is just pitiful oh it's a
two-piece if the tube is all and this is
kind of nice you know for this body con
can set cost twelve pounds
so actually it's not immediately majorly
cheap but it cost 12 pounds let's try it
on the girl wearing it looks all kind of
buff so maybe I have a birth moment as
well
this isn't bad at all you know you know
I've got a bit of an issue with leggings
and leggings and crop tops but I'm gonna
be in with the young people who all
religious and and crop tops
you know lettuce and I feel fat this is
a very nicely insect and it's actually
making me look kind of like yeah a
little bit the top to dissolve but only
thing is that I pick the one with the
hoodie doing it down with the kids
yeah with the key are those of you have
never been caught and so yeah halftime
get never been caught trying it car got
it yeah a so it's
cotton fabric is actually alright it's
what I would expect from this kind of
outfit whole question is is 12 pounds
actually yes
12 times of the parking for this
actually they're more some bed leggings
from Zara that was 19 pounds and they
tall the first time I wore them so it's
not a clothing piece it's a waist
trainer because as you know you talk
about the tushy Fitness and trying to
work on that so what waist trainer I do
have others that I've worn in the car
and I wanted to see if this is as good
it stinks it smells like a man's gym kit
so this is my old waist trainer this is
a new one and I'll tell you from our
fact this is no this is nowhere near as
thick as this and this is a really
really good one by just fit into that
anymore this is just quite thin and this
cost 10 pounds a lot of weight trainers
actually go for 25 pounds in the blaster
is a bargain okay so this small is
basically a large and it's no good I can
so it's not that great very rubbery
there's an improper Akane and this isn't
going to be great if you are actually
looking at you know trying to get some
more support so no and I actually don't
know what this is I did it I doesn't
have all her when the expectation is so
far from the reality here baby
sanfur discipline actually by that I did
but this 700
[Laughter]
this is oh ha ha I have a local computer
that how does looks anybody invited this
looks like a shirt you know a race event
or some guy right listen listen stop
talking business video how it's doing it
it was looking so straight up and down
and as this continues what on it looks
all right but it's itchy is itchy this
is very annoying because the way that
dress came out of the bag I like to
dress is this who's Jim best is this but
it kind of looks like the dress that I
thought it would look like now again my
body doesn't look like that and we've
had lunch so yeah and actually it does
look a little bit similar and it's a
cheaper material it's very itchy and I
feel like at the first wash it will
bubble up okay I'm sorry for laughing at
you dress you're looking funny of the
hanger but you look all right on okay
this is meant to be my dark yellow
knitted batwing top it's more like an
orange
it smells like fry off this actually
smells like fire okay so this is this
jumper here yeah oversized only here the
rest is just kind of one kind of
shrunken mess it's very very short and I
can feel very short on here because I
can feel the stitching and then oversize
I would assume that the please would be
a lot longer
I do have long arms right the walk we've
all realize that positions on the
particularly long however this has this
is this is a thrill this is going to be
a joke right
obviously it stinks out the bag so it's
a little bit off-putting and it doesn't
feel great on this isn't one or cotton I
don't know what what this is I don't
know why it smells that little flame
some of like actual fire I don't have
many words of this besides I hate it
so that's me actually being nice okay
the nice five-pound item most of the
items actually won five pounds I ended
up buying this is a high stretch
miniskirt with I let detail I'll make it
a bit diet because you can see I was
going to try to say something positive
about it it's stretchy but let's see
what it looks like on and it also got
the nice detail to lace it up
the lace is so afraid that it can't go
through the holes and the skirt is
see-through look at this this is
entirely Seifer right check out that I
let details right here that is spreading
like a spread eagle right here and this
just looks a bit dodgy right I will be
getting my five pounds back okay this
one's cute this is a three power mesh
top and if you guys follow me enough you
know I love me a little bit with
see-through mesh top I'm hoping this is
cute and although this is arriving at
the fourth of September it's already
arrived so they need to probably update
their system so this is this three-pound
mesh top which is very very nice it is
very much and very very seated as the
only to you normally when I wear mesh
tops like this they're not this
see-through and this is because it's
just a really fine mesh but it is nice
and much I quite like the kind of
gathering detail it has at the neck and
it's making my girls look like this
sit-in and in two three three pounds
three pounds every time I type in
something out of the bags and like what
is this set in capsules when I open it
into fact what is this funnily enough
this is one of the first items like it
when I was on the website when really
that the way the back look and actually
the back looks nice it literally looks
like what it looks like in the integers
right but just on a rival it is just
it's a bin liner it's a ripped bin liner
it's a bin line up with the rooks at the
back she's in a sack patrician in the
sack
Patricia in a sack a lot of stuff they
said that I haven't received yet but I
have received it this is right here
here's this lace velvet cami again it
looks like a nice piece on the camera
okay there's some loose threading detail
here and the Velvets are touch shiny but
it's not awful you know I don't hate it
at all this cost four pounds and it does
look like the image that is there it
isn't bad if it's slightly just off keep
sitting here it's never going to be
perfect but it's not awful I don't take
this at least it kind of looks like the
item and this is four pounds if you
watch my fashion overhaul so the dress
that I like and this is basically the
white top version of this dress so I
wanted to compare listen they just
brought this all back all of a sudden so
this is the white clock this was for Pam
this is affordable right now and it's
exactly the same if you watch my last
session in the video if you haven't
check it out but this is what this looks
like if they've got the exact same shape
and obviously the next detail and this
is the dress version which is $32 now
why I am going to tell you is that the
quality is not the same this material is
I don't know what it is
it's not great this is a lot thicker and
this also has a kind of sticky thing to
keep it in place on your boobie and this
has got nothing but egg so if you are
about to move fast we're going to have
an eclipse the balance between fashion
is do you care about quality or do you
care about what it looks like so this
looks shoot I like it it has the same
look how thin bill looks like the image
is a copy it's a four-pound copy whoo
yeah okay this is a hoodie the hoodie
cost three pounds eighty when it was
meant to be hoodie there is no hood home
of the would be why I don't know
okay so this is this top on that look
like it has a hood on it but it doesn't
have a review on it and it looked like
it was like sweater like jumper material
it's not it's literally as stiff a s is
it okay okay yeah it looks alright
it just isn't what I thought it was like
can you imagine this as if it were like
sweat hoodie with its like leggings or
whatever that's why I thought that was
going to live right it's not looking
like that to me it's four pounds I don't
love it I don't love it but actually it
looks okay Jonesy which is again most of
these items they look okay from far
until you come up close and you're
touching you feel so my last item of the
stuff that I've got so far from wish so
yeah I will give you my final thoughts
right now okay guys so I am Donna with
the wish try on so at least we get a
little bit different to my other ones
because with my other ones you know and
every time I film is it is I don't know
why I'm going to expect right the other
ones I thought as either hit or miss but
I wouldn't mind you know spending my
money and going and telling people to
spend their money on it whereas save
this fat I just like my opinion is I
wouldn't risk it
I don't think it's necessary I think
it's a bit too unsure and I don't know
for me it just felt a little bit like I
wouldn't want to you know encourage you
guys to go onto that website but there
was some good items there like this top
actually looks okay on it wasn't what I
thought it was going to be but if you
had your heart dead set on something
being nice and then it coming and it's
not even close to what you thought it
was going to be then my only thing I'll
say is I really read the description
really well also if there are reviews
check those out but for me it's a no
it's actually no and I was just looking
at the site a little bit more and it
looks like but the reason why it comes
from lots of different places is because
it's from lots of different sellers so
every seller is different it's similar
to like an eBay or an Amazon
something like that where it's lots of
different stores and lots of different
products from lots of different places
so one store on their back meat might be
really amazing and have really good
items but then one store might have
something that smells literally like
flames so it's just a bit hit or miss
and I think if you're someone can use
they're not that fast on quality you
just want something that looks nice take
the picture well and you might throw it
away two or three days later and then it
could be an option for you if you're
looking for something a little bit more
like to build your wardrobe with it
wouldn't be a recommendation from me
remember this is only half of my wish
order so if you want to see a part two
maybe there'll be some better items in
there then let me know in the comments
also give this video a thumbs up and in
the meantime I will catch you in my next
video if you're not subscribed to
subscribe also follow me on my Instagram
as well and my snapchat and my Twitter
as well as I do tweet and the world yes
that's it okay guys thank you for
watching and I'll see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
