spent of featuring beloved grace and I
feel like a lot of people something I've
been shading reacting like you need to
buy great some clothes she has cut it's
okay but I will be nice to do a mummy
and baby
I spent a video and what are you eating
babe I went shopping on one of my
favorite site which is a river island
it's been a hot minute since I've partly
from River Island and I wanted to buy a
couple of pieces of myself and then I
went onto the website and I remember
that they have an amazing children's
collection like they've got stuff for
newborns and that kind of stuff so I
decided you know what let's go buy some
goodies let's do a nice spin are your
modeling that tissue paper very well oh
is that your little napkin is it a bib
it's not a bib oh yeah hello
[Laughter]
well but do you know what let's just get
into this video this is the first top we
have inside this fat and I don't know
how stable gross is gonna be so we're
gonna just try this is a jumper it's so
cute it says creme de la creme and it's
like what kind of is this like a bright
blue teal kind of color georgians it
current is not using you don't see okay
so company Gray's doesn't want to put
anything in it
jump up yeah okay okay so next up I
bought these adorable boots I'm not
gonna lie I do find that stuff is
expensive for kids it's actually the
same prices add up stuff I think these
boots were 25 pounds we're gonna try
your boots let's try some boots on let
me show you first onion oh I've got
these like damn one T's and like fluff
how cute are these though honestly how
cute are they let's put on your boots oh
you look nice great this number is crumb
dinner grown and the size I've got this
size 18 to 24 she's not willing to put
it on right now so you're just gonna
have to see it like this okay so this
raincoat was 20 pounds I'm not gonna lie
it does kind of look like a plastic
carrier bag their reason for March me to
here and I'm now thinking about 20
pounds I actually feel like this is it
school very expensive for what you get
but it's very cute and I know that right
um wetsuits and stuff like that they can
be on the pricey side so I totally get
it
I feel like this would look really cute
and should wear this over any other
jacket she already has
next up oh my gosh this jump is so
adorable it says three
big 12 pounds not as weird I just don't
know if I feel like it's cheap or not I
think it's a reasonable price for a nice
jumper and it's actually quite nice and
felici oh it's fleece on the inside
which is really good okay so this is
this jumper the dream big jump up I
think it's super cute it's definitely a
bit large for her it's one that you'll
grow into and it's really nice sweat
material that's kind of nice I bought
myself some good stuff we're just gonna
try that on in a second so I got some
jeans for grace she never wears jeans
she always wears leggings don't you ever
think that geez that weighted groan for
babies like honestly look at this like
who are you this is one teenager outfit
your niche two years old relax okay so I
ended up picking these these are like
two pieces I hope it's the two pieces
yes it is so what you get is like the
nipple jumper this is really soft I do
not know which baby is gonna keep this
looking nice so here's this outfit here
it's actually slightly see-through and
it'll be a baby
and like yeah you can take it off
alright I'll take it off so this is
super cute it's super super super soft
it's really nice but I gotta be honest
with you it's a little bit see-through
and I feel like this is like we're
really nice fabric not fabric I would
put a baby in because I feel like it
won't take long before this would be a
hot mess and then I picked another
matching set it's oh it's a little
hoodie match instead yeah how much is
this 22 pounds oh it's 22 pounds for the
top and the bottoms so it's 22 pounds
for that okay so this is this set on
it's super cute and I'm gracing gray
this is so nice the set was 22 pounds
you tie yes this is super nice look at
that yeah it was it was 45 pounds it
went down to 20 pounds or 22 pounds
lavender gorgeous
during the bat sighs okay are you just
angry because it's in you cuz oh because
you know I'm filming a video if you can
see grace right now she's holding on to
her old hoodies for dear life she ran
out of this room grabbed her old hoodie
literally won't let go of it because she
knows that she doesn't want new clothes
maybe we should all learn from grace you
don't need new curtains the color is so
nice it's faux fur on the inside so it's
really really warm and this is really
nice I feel like she can really grow
into this jacket as well and I think
it's what I press on the outside for 22
pounds I actually think this is a
bargain yeah
shooting the grace is a little difficult
but hopefully I was able to put in the
couple of the outfits but I actually
realized she doesn't like new clothes
like she likes her old clothes and
anytime you get her new clothes she's
always a bit finicky with it right let's
go ahead and try some of the goodies
that I got for myself from another
Island okay so this top here is it's
very bright very bright maybe I'm
getting a bit carried away and excited
sometimes I make orders and I can't
necessarily remember exactly what I
ordered but this looks super cute really
nice 24 pounds for this quite nice quite
nice material okay so this is what this
looks like on it's slightly cropped but
it's like not crop crop it's just
slightly cropped which I find a little
bit weird I've got to say yellow is my
color I love it's not really yellow it's
more like a orangey yellow s color it's
nice I like the weight bits it's really
comfortable and I like the bat DL pink I
see that that bad do super cute
I feel like it just needs more detail on
the front but it it's a nice little it's
a nice little top I don't know if it
looks a bit weird on me though like it
makes my body shape look a bit weird
mmm it's not bad though it's not bad I
don't know if you guys know this but
some my favourite well-fitting jeans
come from River Island so I picked up a
new kind of
indigo denim oh these are the mid-rise
Molly jeans size 10 boy I can tell this
gonna be nice I hate when there's that
on there though
I will actually peel that off my other
jeans don't have that on that ah they're
such a nice feeling pair of jeans on
like they're the perfect shape the
perfect skinny my bub looks very small
in there but it looks tidy it doesn't
look like a pit it just looks like me it
doesn't look massive or really curvy it
just looks like it's in a good position
but look really there is no perfect
skinny mess like this is how how high I
like to wear my trousers because I've
got a short torso I don't actually know
why I like to wear my jeans so high but
I need stuff that sucks in the bottom
half of my stomach and yeah oh oh the
pockets aren't real they're fake
bookends I tried to put my hand in
they're not real there is one really
tiny pocket here but I just don't
understand what anyone's meant to be
getting in here a point like why but the
pockets at the bath oil the 40 pounds
which is actually about normal for jeans
and I feel like Topshop jeans are 42
pounds I remember when they used to cost
baby pounds well you know times have
changed I'm gonna change not that I feel
like I look nice this is what you call
snatched like this is just going soup
everything's being kept really nice and
tight and I like that all this top which
I thought really look nice it's kind of
like a tailored esque off the shoulder
something or the other and it looked
really nice on the model on the website
I don't even understand how I'm gonna
put this on right now oh I can see that
might look good you know
oh go River Ireland let's try it on so
this is what this shirt looks like on I
like I like the style I feel like the
colors wrong or maybe it's cuz I'm
wearing it with the denim jeans it's
just putting me off there's something
about it that just doesn't look a bit
doesn't look right and obviously this is
like shirt material its shirt material
but it's off the shoulder so I don't
know which place of work you would be
wearing
- I think it looks nice though I just
think it's the genes that throw me off
put in the camera it looks nice I feel
like right here it looks good but when
I'm looking at I'm a bit like it's not
bad top that I think I need to just
change my bottoms to work out if I like
it or not but I always love tops that
are a little bit more unique and
different and this is definitely a
little bit different I'm on it
my idea don't hate it this is if you
want to be like corporate but corporate
with swag oh do the world why missing
that okay okay oh these are nice
these are either you're gonna like are
you gonna hey look at this these are
basically some why are they either some
smart like paper bag rousers I wonder if
they would look good together
let's see your balance is between Krusty
the Klown and then looking stylish let's
see if we get this balance right no
itchy looks like I've got a waste paper
bag on do you know what I think I need a
smaller size I think these are nice but
I don't think they look good on gods at
me I have a short torso so this just
makes me look shorter and broader out
here and I've got a size 10 and I
definitely need a size a like if I wore
it properly it would be all the way up
here and that just makes me look like
you know like a supply teacher at school
and you have the one who comes near
wears trousers all the way up here
that's why I feel like I look like like
the principal is nice and if your torso
is long this is gonna look so good maybe
I just need to try it in a smaller size
what do you think oh you guys say that
oh it can convince myself tonight
something I do not I feel like I could
like this in a smaller size but here is
just giving me Krusty the Klown like
it's too much bricks so nice though
okay next and another pair of big pants
I remember that I took these are these
are a bit over like you know what put
your shop let's see if you look good in
these it smell like bleach it really
smell like bleach these are a crop wide
trouser I wanted to do fashion these are
crop white trouser and I loved the way
it looked and let them Mordor whether or
not it's gonna look that good on me
let's just see see this is what happens
when you try to do fresh on I feel like
when other people wear these kind of
trousers they look really nice I feel
like I'm trying to catch a cold writing
my ankles like honestly sure they need
heels I don't know I have a very lost
this is happens when you tried to do
something new I did buy some heels at
you I bought some mules
I bought these meals because I felt like
these would go really well with a pair
of trousers like this check out these
meals I feel like I'm getting completely
left oh god oh god what these are really
big were they so big oh god no it's not
this looks very Paris Fashion Week esque
it doesn't suit me it doesn't suit me oh
I wish it did though I love I love this
part of the Jean this part looks really
good Wow
just some things that just don't see me
you know where you're like new year new
me I'm gonna try something different
with my style like can you see how all
from up here it looks good and then just
below it's just like it's a no it says
please stop trying to catch flies in
there yeah I was trying to do something
a little bit different but I'm just
gonna not do that oh yeah right I've
been needing more polo necks so this is
the polo neck but this is different and
I'm not gonna lie
everything I'm open it feels really nice
feels really really nice oh my gosh I
like and I don't like I love oh jeez
there's holes everywhere there's even a
hole on the side of the hand and look
for those of you who've got tri-coat is
a cool tracker mainly I would try
they are fail or small holes it's this
is on the tether of triggering me I
think I've used the word correctly
because I don't want to get attached to
using the way triggered but yes I
believe it's triggering a phobia Oh
political I do feel like this is on the
terror of making me feel the way I feel
when I see small holes like Oh gross but
it's also on the terror of cute
I love tops that have got like a little
bit more detail on them like you know
just say a little bit more and this is
really saying a lot look at it it's got
holes here we've got holes here we've
got holes here it's really really soft
it's really nice but you won't catch a
cold
yeah I do like that I really do like
that my brother today yeah oh okay this
is another one this is just another one
let's see what this looks like on this
is just me all day this is exactly what
I needed and what I wanted in my
wardrobe oh so cute you know I'm a
simple lady I like to wear dresses and
stuff to like get dressed up but on a
day-to-day basis I just want to look
casual cool you know casual cool casual
go this is gorgeous
this is nice oh my gosh so I bought this
top oh my god it looks really nice but I
don't know if it's gonna look too like
MA
I just wanted something a bit different
let me try this on I really like this
top I know it's a new year new me kind
of top because it's very different you
know high neck no cleavage on show is
this a new Patricia I do like it though
I love this detail here it helps me
snatch in my waist you know give the
illusion of shape and it's just I think
he looks really nice this is the new
elegant Patricia darling and elegant
darling I'm elegant but on the weekend
I'm bougie spa you know that I really
like it I think it's really nice I'm off
to China actually and this is the car
I'm gonna be bringing to China with me
you know let them know I can be
elegant as well even though I'm pop
ratchet you know something it was a nice
top very different it's very different
but I'm down I'm down for it different
but down different so I also bought some
swimwear because I'm also off to Mexico
but in a couple of weeks and yeah you
know I like to update my swimwear this
oh my gosh this is giving me a lot of
fanny I don't know if I'm gonna show you
guys mushroom right on because the way
how Christmas impacted their regions I'm
just sucking really let's see so I
bought this swimsuit which I thought was
really nice I feel like it will give you
quite a nice shape and then it's got
like a zip for like zipping up and
zipping down so if I want to be like
will be but I don't be like conservative
I can which I like and then this
gorgeous bikini set this is super
gorgeous my boobs are just gonna be
dripping in roses how nice is that
and then my bottoms are also slightly
dripping in roses and it's high-waisted
so maybe I'll put this on let's see okay
guys this is slightly low calm for
YouTube I might have to do a bit of
censoring but I wanted to quickly show
you what this swimsuit looks like on its
kind of buying in it's super super cute
I feel like I love a high-waisted bottom
like this that kind of just hides the
lumps and bumps and I know some people
like you shouldn't be self-conscious
you're on the other yar you look great
which I definitely feel like I do but it
doesn't mean that I don't have
insecurities I'm definitely insecure
about my body but I don't know hold me
back like I'm here just being out all
out I'm not so I'm like ah that's what I
do I might feel the fear and do it
anyway well I love that kind of cute in
this go let's go go let's go and I love
the fact that is high-waisted I love
this section here it's actually holding
in a couple of the rolls not really
gonna show like the back and sides but
you know what it looks good I'm happy
but could it be a bit more like this
like can we cover a slightly more boobie
okay I'm gonna try this to women or
bless see ok so here's this swimsuit on
I really like it so Oh
just normal thought
conservative I don't know if it's a
little bit small for me I feel like I
could use a breast out here like we're
just on the verge it's a little bit tiny
around this region because it's one of
these like higher waisted ones okay I
think guys I am done yeah so what I've
learned is no grace does it like new
clothes she's happily in her Victorian
dolls dry but Eddie wooden she's not
into it that is generally a dress a top
from Grandma who is 97 years old this is
from from back like almost hundred years
ago so that's very interesting
but she had no qualms putting that top
on but everything else she was like nah
you learn something new you learn
something new every day okay so that is
the end of todays video some goodies
from a river island and also featuring
some kiddie goodies as well for great
don't know how well the video actually
went because grace was just giving me
pure struggle oh okay so my overall
thoughts on River Island
I mean it's and I love her violin you go
there you know what you're getting I
don't shop there all the time to be
honest I feel like there's so many
options and nowadays that some of the
old classics I don't shop in this much
but to go there and I do feel there are
some nice pieces that I like I feel like
when you shop in these classic stores
like Topshop Zara River Island you know
what you're getting and it's almost like
this level of security that you have
when you purchase from your classic high
street that I kind of really appreciate
and I've kind of missed so if you guys
want to see more like high street whores
like ice but in Zara that kind of stuff
give me a thumbs up let me know and
maybe were just we're gonna just make
this year year the classics maybe I'll
do like Rose girl and shoes ads or
wherever it's called you guys were
mentioning or these stuff maybe so any
other ones you want me to check out let
me know in the comments and I'll see you
soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
