it's my little secret okay secrets
revealed no life can't just be roasting
stuff hello beautiful people welcome to
my channel I hope you are doing well
I'm excited ever always are and you know
we've been festive you know we're having
fun over here we're spending a little
bit of money but God did it
and today you know we've gone we've got
a bit more boo sheep and normal unites
we have tried the site but I have never
tried before though I have seen around I
don't know how many of you guys know
about this brand I'm sure some of you do
but I didn't really know about it it is
called naked stuff mmm strike in the
back I bought some stuff women and
compassion and some of you guys probably
are like that right that's what I was
kind of right the reason why I decided
to pick some stuff from this site is
because a lot of people that I love and
I follow from like Sweden or Germany or
Norway they often are wearing items from
naked fashion I feel like it is the a
source of like the Nordic part of town
or the Nordic part of Europe or our
European cousins I'm sorry I'm sorry
about brexit man why this happening I'm
sorry I love you Sweden coming okay yes
so um yeah I often see those girls
wearing naked fashion I don't see a lot
of people like in the US or in the UK
wearing it I see them wearing more
boohoo or me sky little pretty little
things and in the u.s. they were more
hot Miami styles revolve or fashion over
those are some of the other sites I've
definitely got to review butt naked
fashion I was just like you know I need
to check this website out and I ended up
spending let me just tell you I ended up
spending 452 pounds 40 pence was just
you know I've done a big hose before
usually when I you know do because I
don't
more than just a single back I saw the
cheapest sight in the world and for
those of you who don't know I do not get
sponsored by the brands that I feature
in these videos I want to keep them as
impartial as possible and you guys know
I'm quite you know quite straight to the
point
quite a pin you name it so brands are
not going to be pointing to necessarily
do that and so they don't sponsor me but
today I have been sponsored by 21
buttons hello they are basically a
fashion discovery and inspiration app
and I have a profile on there and it's a
great app for sharing fashion and
outfits and looks and white absolutely
love about it is that you're able to
link the items and find the direct link
which for those of you who want to shop
and I always get people asking me
where's that from but I'll show you this
is my profile on 21 buttons I can be
like oh here we go look press the button
there's the dress like literally or
something similar to it like say this
Mike I've got this picture here and I
can just do that there's the actual link
and I think that's absolutely sick
really really good it's great for
inspiration there were so many other
bloggers and vloggers and instagramers
who are on there linking that item so I
will be uploading my fashion looks onto
this app and I love the fact that you
know this is way better for just
literally fashion and buying versus you
know lifestyle and storytelling like if
you're looking for an outfit for
Saturday night I'm gonna have it on my
21 buttons app so yeah it's free to
download I have it in the description
bar below and yeah thanks to them for
sponsoring this video because actually
made impartial
I'm always impartial but at least I can
be very frank with my wording and as I
said I spent 452 pounds and this is a
bug let's see if it's worth it let us
see also before I get into this video
but it's the pregnancy comment look
we're just gonna have to just hold down
on those not pregnant
I usually just somehow end up filming
these videos after lunch and I have the
lunch baby the basmati baby we've talked
about this so no there is no rumors of
pregnancy
please don't it's a
centerline is really to just not until
someone tells you they're pregnant then
wait till that moment this here is a
sweat Nick jump car ah okay it's got
this like neck detail I don't know it's
doing something it's a dusty pink the
price is the price is 40 pounds because
I haven't been spending on higher price
items recently it's like all 40 pounds
is a lot but it feels really nice but
let's see what it looks like on mmm okay
this is what this looks like corn it's a
bit different it's a bit different and
love the color I love the dusty pink I
think it looks nice
but it's a 40 pound nice that is a
different story though
this is just a nice little cute unique
jump art show my arm because I love
toned arms if they don't do anything
with them I'm saying it's a nice little
winter piece but if it's winter where
are you going with an arm out like no a
home will actually turn to ice I feel
like I need some leggings I definitely
picked up some leggings these are
glittery zip pants so these are all okay
okay that's got some long torso why is
it also this long it's a 49 pounds they
don't feel like normal legging material
they do feel nice but 49 pounds is a lot
of running that's almost 50 pounds Wow
I do like the fact that it's got this
crease in the front this just trail
let's stop talking let's try oh that's
ok so there's high waisted and there's
literally a long back there literally a
bra there a bra legging these meant to
be this long honestly that this is my
bra this is the legging
I've never seen a trouser like this in
my life
what's mad is that kind of here you know
hold on
this is actually just extender back long
back look why why would you want your
back to look so long I don't understand
it it's more like a bodysuit like your
kidneys would never get cold in these
but my mom that's depressed and it's
lonely it needs a workout but why what
is a legging bra a legging bra okay like
how they look there isn't like a mini
penis or anything I like this detail
here
sighing oh okay I just checked the
picture there's a zip here and they're
meant to be worn like flares
why would you want to flare and leg in
okay it's a flare leg in this what
they're doing over in Europe right now
okay let me go put some heels on
okay do I like it I want to do that I do
like it honestly it's a bit of a weird
one I've never seen anything like this
do you know what I'm not mad at it we
have a flare theatre leggy and we've
also got breast support at the same time
all right over here I've got a oh okay a
cropped Oh a sat in the cropped blazer
and the satin material is very nice how
much is this so this is 40 pounds and 95
pens expensive but in my opinion not too
expensive
especially after seeing the satin that
was on in there the Kourtney Kardashian
Kollection like that item was weight for
thin like as in wafer thin painfully
thin rose this is really heavy nice
satin like I'm like oh this is nice
right it cost more let's see oh look at
this all together
Oh Boosh yeah look at this there's not a
lot of material here they put to be 40
pounds you know I love this little top
the sleeves look at the sleeves this is
a look this is quite different yes sure
yes going out for dinner I really like
this but I love like little crop tops
like this because it makes me look like
I've got a nicer figure than they
actually do that oh that does look like
a little bit like an extender back not
gonna lie but as a look I really like
this I think this top is fantastic I
love the shape and like the fit of it
and I love the length of the sleeves as
well and the satin is really nice thing
unfortunately we've developed a hole in
the crotch which is not a good look
when these are 49 pounds no no no we do
not need holes developing nah nah honey
okay guys I literally just found the
matching boob tube for it so I see how
it's meant to be like a look it's 25
pounds for a rib of material not gonna
lie it fits really well it's nice
material but I think it could be a
little bit pricey but you know what I'm
not mad I think it's really cute and
he's got like rubber in it so it won't
keep dropping down no like I like it now
this top is so mean look at it
darling oh my gosh I need this it's not
my much need to say but I saw this
t-shirt is $14.99 I love the shape of it
and I love the fact that says darling I
say darling all the time darling darling
I mean you can't really go wrong with a
little slogan t-shirt I usually like to
tuck it in and I love the fact that it's
got like cutoff sleeves like this I mean
it's not like special it's not like the
thickest material but again this is not
it's not an expensive t-shirt all right
darlings what's next oh I saw this and I
thought it'd look really really cute
this is like a denim dress the kimono
things like is it a jacket is it a dress
is it both 49 pounds it's not thick
denim but let's try it on and see where
that's like so that this looks a little
bit like a dressing gown just the denim
dressing girl
I do like kimonos and stuff but I just
don't know what I think about a bit in a
good old 2017 slash 18 I try to wear as
a dress and it niching look like I
forgot my trousers I don't know there's
something about this that looks very spa
dressing down that's just frumpy unless
you like tie it like that I literally
just to create a little bit of a waist
so you don't look to the shape honestly
like that now now I'm trained so hard
nobody tries so hard to make something
work you just like really when you feel
like that just put it away it's not for
you let it go let it go okay this is a
little vest a
cowl-neck singlet but it's cute and
again this satin material is really nice
oh okay let's try it off okay
for a minute there I was about to lose
hope in this top because it was standing
to attention like a bucket that needed
water it was just doing that however it
kind of does flatten in and it does have
a nice little cowl-neck cowl-neck effect
going on
I mean it's 20 foot may have just become
cheap but the quality is nice I can give
you that that the quality of the top is
a really nice top I lie here and I've
looked been looking for a little top
like this that drapes and looks really
cute you know that you know isn't nipple
to the wind like this could be very
nipple to the wind but actually it's
nipple to the cover it's fine if I bend
a bit too low down then yeah it is
nipples to the wind but it will take a
while to get there okay let's see what's
next
alright next up we've got another jump
up because cosy and this just looks like
a basic jump off well I'm hurt by this
and it's nice though to really low V how
much is this this is 33 pounds I don't
think it needs to be that expensive
let's try it on it's a nice it's a nice
little casual nice little fit jump part
I really like the fit of it but look at
the color this is a gorgeous color they
say the car this is a good thing this is
the room of the night the jump is nice
it's really cozy and you know what they
do they get the sleeve so right like
another quite long but you can just use
that I really want to be able to just be
like criticizing and then say I can come
across eyes is the price no life can't
just be roasting stuff and I know I
spend a lot of time you know just
laughing at myself and laughing it some
of the coping that I thought or some of
those other Georgie website but it is
actually quite nice to just find some
really nice clothing from really nice
size okay what is this well how are they
guys spoke too soon because this is
nothing but a pamphlet there is not much
material in here at pamphlet where mine
is - let's see it on this is gonna be my
face with the whole video
look at this dress
this is 33 pounds the material isn't the
thickest is kind of pamphlet but it
isn't like too too too thin and the
waves give me one one little contour you
know I think there's something about the
lines and like the new rocks that is
really nice the fit is so fabulous like
my babies I'll just sit in like hello
will be my old friend just sitting and
just live in their best life this is my
face this entire video basically I love
the way I look in it that's what's
really important when you love the way
you look in something I'm talking in
desperately now if I pass out while I
purple ease then you'll understand why
but like and know like I've got a little
bit of a waist trainer on right now
underneath this I would have showed you
but I can't really lift up the dress
it's the no corset just for a little bit
of support
I wear support underwear because you
know where my body said I was right
about now is them but you can't tell can
you tell what I underwear you got on is
there Spanx you don't need to know look
for the pocket is up
it's like race or biking style which I
think looks really nice and as you can
see it gives me nice curves but like
elegant curves I need somewhere to go
Giavotella that like clothing that you
like and you know man I wish I could go
out so people could see me looking my
best

is full well bit velvet Queen Wow Wow
kind of Street worry okay

good with red hair like it looks so good
let's try it on
I swear down getting into this jump up
almost dismantled my whole week I'm
actually stocking I'm actually sweating
dinner dad like I think I might go for
them
separately but all together it looks
like I'm doing the uttermost if you
never ever use the word Juicy Couture
it's giving me that vibe I don't look
good in sportswear
I just don't I just don't have the body
for it I don't know why okay one more
cookie I don't know how I'm gonna get
out of this okay we've got some sequins
sequins whoa this is kayuu yes this is
shining shining shining shining no
however this was fifty eight pounds so
in these two shining it's a good son of
the corner of my eye you need sunglasses
to see me if you're gonna be 58 pounds
let's try it on
so I love everything about this dress
but it's not only nipple to the wind is
also alright x marks the spot of my
nipples to the wind like isn't it you
drawing a lot of attention to the like
boobie region
the dress is friar what princess this
isn't as look what and I look at that
come on but it needs to be like that but
everything about the dress is phenomenal
I'm gonna wear these to a party I'm
gonna tell you take me here and T take
me there we're just gonna roll we just
got a rope oh I like this is this dress
I'm not even wearing my control pants
under this but they control plants are
my secret yes I wear a corset let me
just show you my rope my secret this
baby when I get this from

this has been amazing and it's quite
light and it's my little secret okay
secrets revealed I do I do like it teddy
gonna win so sometimes you're allowed to
I really really love it you know what
make it fashion you have been phenomenal
honestly look at this and look heavy
guns and look bullshit dot I got a
little bit of shoulder pad coming out we
got a little bit of booty but not too
much our materials fighter and that
teeny this dress was was 58 pounds right
but I know how much I've spent on a
birthday dress I know I meant much I
spent on special occasion dresses I can
easily on houses EP you can easy spend
150 pounds on a dress and actually for
me for 58 hours
is a great dress I actually consider it
to be a bargain for a special occasion
dress I'm gonna see this on my 21
buttons Rosalie
you've done is carried away let us see
from the thoughts okay guys that is me
done I did notice I enjoy you know
picking out the holes in items that I
find when online websites but I must say
I really thought that the items were
really really really good on naked and
you know there's there's one or two
times I had wanted to practice on them
before and I didn't I didn't because
obviously it's a site that I hadn't
really use I hadn't really heard anybody
that I know talked about using it so I
hadn't but obviously because I do this
series and I'm trying different websites
obviously I'm trying something that you
know I wouldn't normally do and I think
it's amazing to me it reminds me of a
sauce it doesn't mind me of a sauce but
it might even be slightly better
slightly better I don't know I said I
love it a sauce you guys know that but I
feel like every piece was really nice
the only thing I'd say is obviously the
price right the price was a little bit
you know a bit higher than some of the
cheaper websites but as they say you do
get what you pay for and I feel like the
ratio of the stuff that was good quality
and look nice was way higher way higher
than some of the other stuff where I
pick it out and I want to wash my hands
because it actually just made of literal
god nonsense and sometimes you do want
to be a bit like all these websites are
the same but actually I didn't feel like
that I didn't feel like it was the same
I felt like it was a bit different fresh
and I'm a fan and I'm not wanted I'm not
paid and that I wish I hear me there I'm
not paying me nothing so for me to be
able to say that is it's quite a big
thing and but the people who are been me
are 21 butters they're my sponsors for
this video it's a free app download it
