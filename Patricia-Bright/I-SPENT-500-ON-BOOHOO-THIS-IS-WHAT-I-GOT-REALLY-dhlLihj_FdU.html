like it looks nice shiny shiny hello
well hello guys welcome back to my
channel today and if I did we're doing
another testing my videos the last time
I cannot believe the response on it I'm
shocked like how you guys is bonded but
it's all good look up and ready and
raring to go you guys like the truth
were crashing over there about to
recreate it for Boudicca scintilla
system a system in semesters the
listener sensor so I bought a ton on
stuff from Zuzu based on the response
that you guys left in my comment I
definitely have a she inside video
coming I made right order but a week
later owner isn't actually here yet so
yeah and we'll see however the items
from bitch she came in a day like in a
day but I did get the next day delivery
so here we go we're going to do Dooku
today and I spent even more I spent four
hundred and let's get specifically for
okay so I spent four hundred and sixty
nine pounds ninety-nine which is a lot
it is a lot calm but I was testing out
for you guys and the good thing is I can
return the items so if I try on and we
don't like it it's going straight back
and what I buy some like prom pieces as
well as pieces that would be nice or
wedding because that's exactly what this
time of year is about and I'm also going
away so I wanted to see if there be any
nice bits I can wear away
what I feel is that you get a lot a lot
for your money right you can see that
these are too must be heavy
like bags they are about birth society
let me give you a review of the
processes where we get into the clothing
number one the website I found the
website very easy to navigate to me it
looks like a lot of the sites that are
out there so do whoo pretty little
things where all this guy did it
literally a little bit different too
misguided and what I found
very easy to navigate and for me I found
the model a little bit more relatable in
regards to shape and size for me
personally however I do identity like
there was that much diversity when it
came to shapes and sizes which is a bad
thing and there weren't that many curves
right you know I said did what I know
that everyone isn't going to feel that
way one of the things I realized is that
if you are suction top there's like
sixty nine pages of top that's far too
many pages I don't get past page four so
for me I just I hate when there's
there's too many pages to kind of see
sprues and never know if you're going to
be getting the good stuff of the the
good styles on patreon light or not but
you know what I've got very impatient
how I came tonight the process is really
quick and easy my items came the next
day it was good it was quick and easy
right so like I've talked enough let's
get into this video oh and I haven't
opened anything so I'm actually quite
explosive let's get into it all that's
right you know what you go shopping you
can't remember what in born you're like
what was I thinking that's me right now
right so let's get straight into it so
item number one are these faux leather
trousers these are a size eight and I
believe these cost 25 pounds if you guys
know me cause I love leather trousers I
always have it's been a bit of a fetish
that I've been adding but I hate it when
leather trousers are shiny and these
actually fit really nicely but they are
very shiny to me for me the shiny level
is too much the fit is nice but it's
just glossy like it's just glossy like
those okay next up is these jeans these
are high waisted these are like the
perfect blue jeans I love jeans are this
color these are in a size 8 so let's see
space it as well
hey-ya these fit but these are skinny
jeans because if you can see the bottom
and I've got a seat that those are crazy
today I'm manicured
oh my gosh these are but these are kind
of like mom shaped jeans but they're
slightly more for you
oh my gosh I love these these cost 25
pounds Hey
look at this yeah these are so too and I
love the fact that they have this
roll-up on the bottom and to show you
guys the bottom of these can you see
them you see the way they fold up they
are very cool so for me the jeans are
definitely a thing I love the shape
they're not stretchy at all and they're
quite hard denim yes love them okay so
next up we have these jeans right here
these cost 25 pounds they got a last
stretch they actually feel a little bit
like my high waisted Topshop jeans which
I love and mmm let's see I can just draw
the wing to them hold on
you know when you're like come on come
on this is what my husband calls the
booze test he does this big way but like
no one does that with you you don't need
to do that okay let me show you these
jeans every they're really fitted I
probably could do going a size up and
they look really nice I like the shape
and I need a size up I definitely need a
size up and a try the ten fit into the
denim I've got these denim jackets I
wanted to test out the jacket I picked
out a blue one which to me looks like
the exact same blue as the jeans okay
okay I wanted to do my gosh either do
the sunlight when you buy something that
you like what was I thinking I really
thought I was in the wild wild west
right what I feel like it could be cool
or it could just be an ultimate rail are
these the exact same blues not the exact
same but quite similar for me it's not
doing what I would like a denim jacket
to do it's not bad but it's not it's not
great it Akata me isn't quite right flip
your wig okay let's do win the car isn't
quite right it's not the same kind of
denim as if it's a bit of a thinner
denim it's not bad too but if I don't
like it anyway so yes we'll leave that
okay right a mustard
jacket pho Leonard
kick I love a little bit of faux leather
my collection of faux leather jackets is
and is forever growing and I love them
in bright colors oh okay we've got a
double bit you've got a double tip here
because I've got any Conners so this
jacket was 45 pounds but I think it's
quite expensive because I have a faux
leather Zara jacket which I bought for
35 pounds so yeah mm-hmm
it's - it is cute
you don't you get an item and you like
it and it's cute
you don't think can you afford it can I
afford a 45 pounds faux leather jacket
hmm it isn't bad it's really warm I feel
like this would keep you nice and warm
even in the autumn I feel like zipped up
in the side I know like a stuffed turkey
I have no magic stuff but it's a nice
jacket I flip it open yeah love it by
next up this t-shirt kind of like a
muscle tee I love the shape of it so
it's a really nice stretchy tee I've
never had a stretchy tea like this it's
weird right it's not a cotton and it
feels really nice it feels really silky
this says Brooklyn New York I'm actually
off to New York so I was like should I
get something move it or no Gornick so
like you could tie it up really easily
and it would look quite nice I like this
t-shirt I like this t-shirt and look at
the jeans okay okay well I mean the
t-shirt was 16 pounds that I don't know
how much teachers cost what for me I
feel about t-shirt seem to be eight
pounds so annoying a 60 crown 16 pounds
but you're sick and I'm going to keep
you I actually really like the t-shirt a
really nice t-shirt and that's the thing
where you really like from that you
might pay a little bit more for it so
these are the bargain these are 13
pounds and they're basically cocky
trousers and they look like they're
really amazing they're really soft
they're like I don't know what material
this is
then what is going to wash like I cannot
tell you people I'm not going to sit
here and pretend like it's amazingly
high quality but they look really nice I
don't as you can see they're kind of
like this velvet effects okay okay it's
a really nice sound who's ever looking
for an alternative to jean these are
actually really really nice they're
really really soft 13 pounds Wow
yeah okay okay you can yes I like these
I really like these for 13 pounds I love
them alright so next up are these jeans
here they say limit oh gosh there's a
rip in the back I hope this isn't a butt
crack wrap Rick I hate that there's a
limited edition
I bought that perfect remember even
picking these pretending that I'm cool
enough to wear jeans like this is like
me lying to myself just I like what
jeans this is unnecessary but you know
what for you guys I'm just going to try
them on anyway there's holes in the back
and the front and don't like anything
about these look at the cut of them why
is it a bootcut this is literally a
booka booka is obvious Kyle jeans of all
times who is Ducasse why do you think
are they know if we can we angry being
here and like a reptile role this is so
dead this is so dead I'm virtually
making them highly intelligent good
we're going to try and four dresses prom
is in the air
wedding season is in the air let's see
if this and obscenity this dress was 22
pounds and I thought it was really
pretty though it was quite tight to get
on it actually fits really really well
and I feel like it needs to be tightly
that it doesn't like fall down I'll show
you guys like full-length put it website
alright so this is what this dress of
threats on I feel like it's really cute
it looks really nice I mean it's not got
any boning or anything in it but for 22
pounds and if you
can fall quick summer wedding dress I
feel like this is super tuned to where I
feel like it looks nice kind of elegant
and then you would want something a bit
more dramatic for prom now but it isn't
a bad option
I feel like this actually looks more
expensive than in years I feel like it
looks like a 50-pound dress it's
actually 2,200 right so this dress here
this is in that kind of cheap scuba
material that you get from those shots
and I don't know if you remember like
the shop called club I might never have
that shot but you know that kind of
scooby material it kind of does what it
says on the tin but like the print is
nice the fit is nice it's definitely a
very good wedding print and I feel like
it looks more expensive than it is right
from the look of it it looks expensive
but if you touch it you can tell it's
cheap again I feel like this is a nice
summer wedding dress now you guys are
going to sing our wedding were in is
exact year but they feel like if I 20
quid or something like that yes okay
okay a shape hello - darling I want to
go to wedding now cute
I'm not mad love it okay look at this
dress depends on what kind of wedding
guess you want you're going to wear it
because this thigh-high slit is a really
really high this is really fitted so
you're not gonna be able to eat anything
and yeah this neckline is cute but it is
very very low but you can bet is to up
form actually I would have wear to a
wedding but I would wear to abroad with
some nice he'll need to get the right
underwear on this I feel like on a girl
his figure is Banyon this could look
amazing so next up look at this top oh
nothing it's kind of a thin material and
then what this is it's like crepe but
you know what it looks really really
nice on and I saw like a wash well
because it isn't going to bubble up I
want to wear it with these jeans well do
you know what I like that and love the
sleeves and the fact that they're kind
of like a detachable so actually I can
move in this might like tuck it in
something overall I'm not gonna lie for
like I'm quite happy with the items here
now we're saying that they're like
really expensive or really great
material I feel like I've got a lot of
good stuff for the money that I've spent
and I've still got more to try on I love
this I've just pulled it I've just
pulled out of the bag it is cute it is
made of like a crepe material this is
cute this is so nice this is what my
closet really really needs right now
No look at that this is so nice oh my
gosh like I love a bit of thrill and a
little bit of detail like this then if
you guys can see the material is kind of
like a crepe
this looks really expensive and the
style is stunning like actually stunning
if so like it is made out of crepe paper
it looks like it it looks it looks cheap
I feel like it's sticking to me as well
like I don't know what fabricated way
sticks to your skin it's doing that
hello well no this isn't enough for me
this is a no for me actually like this I
love it but it's just it's no it's
really sticking to me underneath here it
just over it I like the arms I think
that these looks fun like banana step
sensor isn't it for me look at this jump
ah yeah it says nineties club I can
telling them and love it it's fully
fully over side oh my god under this
jump I think it's really cool I really
like here not are these jeans that we
like some leggings and stuff these are
sick and for all yes it's long oh but I
did get a large I think it's amazing and
it's quite nice look how bright it is
and it says nineties clap hair gonna
pair this top was very much the mission
to get into so like I'm not even into it
yet you need like super high rates the
trousers to wear this because it's very
very cropped I feel like it's one item
that you
from Inglot why on earth did I buy that
this is 14 pounds I'm not sure I'm not
sure if I think it's worth it
it's kind of cool though it is kind of
cool I just feel like it's a teeny-weeny
bit overpriced to get my Caribbean
Rihanna on with this hmm let's see it on
I mean but I think this looks quite
grandma and I don't like it on
however okay the construction is quite
nice but the knee in and the patent is
actually quite nice I just don't think
this suits me I think it just no me
actually looks like what grandma knitted
for Christmas I get hidden away know
what I know this thing is really interim
right now but it looks ridiculous
English isn't like John Travolta in
grease lightly what the heck did this
did this do this do this
Patricia Oh what is it
Oh hold on guess what it comes in its
own little bolero you shiny it's shiny
Lilith Elvis Elvis Presley is it really
meant to flare from the knee this is my
knee and this is the flare why why snow
you that wife why is the bolero shiny I
I look like an idiot
I literally reckon idiot now honey okay
guys so that is the end of my guru
review and in summary I feel like I kind
of got what I thought I would get I was
pleasantly surprised by some item like
the denim jeans I actually loved but
actually looking at what I've got here
I'm not going to keep the majority of
the items I feel like that's often the
way the cookie crumbles and it comes to
online shopping that you pick a lot of
stuff and you end up only end up staying
there five or six pieces but the pieces
that I am
thing I really really like I just like
the other pieces don't necessarily suit
me so much I don't have an occasion to
wear them too so they need to go back to
the store
the quality was yeah kidding me is to me
I feel like it was you know some things
a really good quality that the jeans I
was very surprised by the sweater the
occasion dress is one of them was like a
really cheap scuba material and the
other was a really nice Lacey material
but it wasn't nastic or that fancy but
it looked really good on I feel like I
need to start giving it numbers but I
would give it a 6 out of 10 like there
are items I'm definitely keeping that
I'm not mad at that I really like and I
always pick items that I think will last
if I look after them well and I saw that
you could find items that did that on
here so guys that is the end of this
video I hoped you enjoyed please give it
a thumbs up and subscribe if you're not
subscribed already and I know I've got
she inside come in listen that's all I
have it coming we just need to wait for
