sweat set I love it when it's 818 pounds

the next day and I'm gonna tell you it's
not even been a full 24 hours I have
received my goodies from the room that
was lychee 12 hours and then by 11:30 I
had received my goodies and shook now
let's see if ooh his recommendations to
me I any good Oh what I'm seeing is
bright orange II yellowy help group what
Kate shade you called it this is very
this is cute this is very trendy it's
the whole like Rihanna Fenty race driver
race car esque style let me see if I can
find something to wear on the bottom I
initially saw these old gothic they're
shiny they're glowing in the dark
they look like clown pants I initially
saw these clothes you guys know I've got
a thing for like the trousers these are
in the new in and then boo who
recommended this boom I think I kind of
like a dho delivery driver but fashion
flash on DHL is it a cute top definitely
not with the pants we are doing too much
this is Instagram on steroids it's doing
too much right let's listen the
travelers they are painted on and my bum
looks long why is my bum look long long
extender back but I like I do like these
I do like these I feel like the
transduction not with the top I would
but I would have to be feeling really
confident in myself to wear these down
like in public but the only thing is I
definitely have got a long back syndrome
going on right now and it's just real
but I've not been squatting as much so
maybe that's the reason as to why I like
the kind of color blocking tone this is
nice well every day where it's just so
unnecessary I
because he went bran continually coming
out so is this clothing in 2018 I've got
to say though these are great they are
really holding down my muffin top it's
really snatching the muffin in and this
is very valuable
trousers need to do this more snatching
the muffin make me feel comfortable
and I look like I've got a long back
syndrome so here we have the nemesis
that I can't get away from and it's
cycling shorts I kept getting
recommended cycling shorts in every
outfit literally every item I picked
there was a cycling short recommended
and then this I saw this in the new in
love this is so mean and sometimes you
just have to be quiet because for some
reason actually do like the cycling
short I thought I was dissing so hard
but actually like this I don't know if
it's really my style but I don't think
it looks bad and I feel like this is a
really nice casual look I've got these
little Reeboks I could wear my Chanel's
that I feel like these would look so
nice I'm like a casual day the sun's
starting to come out and I like this I
love this color palette personally I
love stones and browns and neutrals and
nudes and this is current I think that
the cycling shorts are on their way out
cuz these are twelve pounds and actually
I bought them for six pounds and that's
what they keep recommending them I think
they're just trying to get rid of that
stock really some of you want to pick
some up I don't see why not
I thought it would be way more Fanjul I
like funny to the wind and everything
but it really isn't like there is no
camel but even together it's look don't
don't look too close but even together
it's not actually bad some of them are
literally crotch grazing this is great I
I like this this jumper is nice I like
the fit I like the way it goes over the
shoulder this is not nice material I'm
just gonna put it out there this is not
a nice material jump up but the colors
gorgeous and never aspirated I know it's
very late but we like it so this little
number was part of the new in that they
had and they have
these metallic items I was like okay and
quite like this I feel like they said
like festival it's kind of fun I won't
be wearing it with cycling shorts
probably some back black jeans awesome
denim jeans or something like that but I
forgot be nice on a holiday this is much
nicer than my foot would be it's 20
pounds it's like this metallic and I'm
sure I bought something that metallic
last year that I wore all the time that
I actually love so I feel like I love
this this year as well so after I picked
up this what was recommended and I kept
seeing on the website as Newman was the
whole rainbow thing and I bought this
and the rainbow thing was following me
so I feel like they wanted me to pick up
rainbow I don't know if I'm not cool
enough to understand why this is a trend
it is because Takashi six nine movies
like rainbow hair we need rainbow
clothing now guys I love this I mean
like this why do I love this I love this
what guys why do I love this why do I
love this tell me why I love this this
is not fashion it's not fashion but I I
am living for it I love it I feel happy
in it my daughter will go warrior my
mommy she rainbow I don't know it's not
fashionable it's cute I'm not gonna like
the material is not great I was putting
this on I said what material is this
made of there was no stretch in this
it's a little bit like tissue paper I
would wear this to a festival I will
come up in that bitch and I would be
like I've arrived I have a run I've
arrived I think it's mad I like this
this makes me feel like I'm gonna make
someone's day when I wear it is that
just me no on a genuine note I think the
top is cute probably like something
black something plain we don't need to
do this this is doing the most hmm
interesting
this army works or festival okay next
this
the first things that kicks out this was
in the new in it was a bodysuit it's
cute it's a Maddy my knee on it I
thought this was really nice
they had it in the white version as well
because we're not going to come up in
here with my butthole on the show
another thing that was recommended to me
and all over the website was things
these are from the steppe London um
collaboration with boohoo so Steph
London is a UK rap artist she's really
good she's growing and popular and she's
also got this collection with voodoo so
these were recommended to me along with
lots of other bits from the collection
so I'm gonna pair the two of these well
Wow
you see what I do number one I love this
body it's a really cute body it's really
really nice it fits really well and it's
actually made of ok material it's not
the same as that rainbow material but it
fits nicely and I feel like I like the
design I love the fit of these the
trousers I was thinking is something
very interesting like y-you see through
why are you drunk revolting at the
bottom and just what what what's your
purpose in life trouser tell me the
purpose in life however I think what my
booty looks banging right without
showing all of my ass and bearing in
mind that when I'm away I actually
sometimes Salkind unconfident and
uncomfortable when I'm in a swimsuit you
wouldn't believe that would you you want
to believe it while I filmed this video
but something like this is perfect it's
a perfect alternative to a sarong like
allocute you get a little taste of the
cheeks but not too much and you know
what this judge of all the ladies and
that thing over here isn't bothering me
I think these are some ones I pick one
thing from the stuff London collection
or recommend its Devlin done so I picked
up this dress giving me that Versace
vibe that a lot
oh it's that kind of thick how I explain
this material so this is this dress on
and I was slightly worried about nips
being to the wind not gonna like it's
slightly open
it's more open than I normally go for
we're not all the way at the belly
button I'll give it that the materials
are actually nice and love the stripes
in the pattern I've become so Cordy
people what's happened to me
I was a neutral ball and I'm wearing
stripes with like and what do we call
this brach desired on top of it wow it's
really a lot but what I loved was this
like tight there you go what's that
waist match you know just tie time being
suck me up I can't be doing with this
lovely to my fanny it's just doing too
much but that right here would be
banging um but I really like this you
know probably on my out so this was a
good recommendation from behoof I saw it
I picked in an instant and yours for me
unfortunately I don't like this
my homes are so high and on camera it
looks quite nice but in person it looks
quite cheap I don't like the slut
material and then just the it's boot
cane
I can't explain why are the sweat
bottoms boots cutting right explain to
me why it kind of flares like a tramp it
I'm sick like be a legging or be a
jogger but don't be a flare in a jogging
material I'm confused and something
about them Latisse which is giving me
Robin Hood like the Space Age Robin Hood
I don't know I think the top like by
itself is probably nice and it's just
the bottom of the trousers that are are
throwing me off so if you wanted to get
the top cut the top the trousers they're
giving me Flair they give me bootcut
Flair so I saw this dress it's in my new
favorite thing rib it was in the new in
and I think I was looking at all the
like nudie stuff that they had on you in
and I saw this I was like this is right
up my shame guys I told you clever cause
cleavage wrap his match with his life
is everything you need an address people
I love this I love sweetheart neckline
dresses like this I love the way they
look and even love the color of this if
you're like they have this whole section
that was like about nudes and stuff and
I said okay let me get into it the dress
is nice this is 15 pounds this is 15
pounds and it's actually quite nice my
shoulders are gonna beats and this model
cuts they're gonna be seeing so much
light I think this is really bad I like
it it's even quite short but I can like
pull it down and it isn't literally bum
snatching these short but my bum looks
nice in this if it's cute I love stuff
like this because I feel like it really
makes me feel really comfortable about
my belly I am the kind of person
yes I have insecurities but I don't know
them all that I'd okay this is a great
illusion that brings in the waist if you
are straight up and down get a wrap it's
a great dress this little great dress of
50 pounds unfortunately recommend it to
me after this was this dress you had a
big label on it saying I've seen on TV
what what they like boohoo you are lying
you did you're recommending this because
you want to get it sold it was like this
dress was seen on TV is that a good
thing it lychee looks like a jellyfish
dress but it was a my recommended so
boohoo you thought I might like this
this looks like an arts and crafts
project
this is show-and-tell where mommy made
me a dress because I wanna be a
jellyfish when I grow up
why does the dress have tentacles why we
have this tentacle skirt I don't know
there's no reason for it you thought
this was a good enough dresser idea if
you have this realist tell me you love
this dress I want to know why did you
buy this dress if you bought the dress
dress why would you buy this dress and
why would you buy it this is just a lot
of wasted material this could have made
a whole other dress but who this wasn't
a good recommendation I look like a
jellyfish this is the one thing that
I've got to say about some of these
stores not all of them but it's you know
when you open
package and you're like oh I want it to
be nice and full mazing and then it's
just this right it's basically the same
materials Primark it isn't great it's
very cheap and fast but it probably
looks nice but it doesn't feel nice
right but this is one that was a new in
and I love the way the model look I was
like obsessed with a model I remember
it's the model that I liked and I love
the way she wore this and I like me in
blue and try it on Wow this top is
interesting because it's made in the way
to be lopsided which is quite nice I
feel like it looks nice on it does look
nice on it looks nice on it's flattering
it fits nicely there's something about
the material I just don't like I feel
like I put this in the wash and it's
over that's a wrap but as a fit and
there's a jump heart I think this looks
banging on no am I wrong
it's 12 pounds and I feel like it looks
nice like if you were to wear it once or
twice I just don't think this is gonna
wash well our skip on a skip this is a
keeper I really like this so after I
picked up this basically I got
recommended a whole bunch of really nice
top so boohoo
I'm down and I love blue at the moment
which is crazy and then there's a bunch
of other tees that were recommended so
I'm just gonna put these on and we're
gonna see if they look good okay so
here's this one and I remember when I
pick this up I was so annoyed because
it's cropped and basically everything in
this world is cropped why do we always
have to do crop can you not be cropped
but it's not a bad crop like it's not an
awful crop yes it's not great with these
jeans because we've just got a nice
little Fupa gathering going on it's 14
pounds it's a print it's nice but the
zip is in poor quality
what are these top call racer tops look
I have a thing for these and these are
both from Topshop so this is this vest
so Chicago on it I picked a size 10 I
feel like I should have picked a size a
I really like it I love the fact that
it's not like really really low all the
way down to here more top should be this
this kind of shape it's just a bit more
easier as a girl with boobs like you
don't always want like
oops and I don't have a big my boobs are
fake yes they are but they're not huge
but like you know girls have really big
busts it must be struggling because
everything is Ditchley he's a mill
here's my village he knows all the time
it's just tiring like we're not hungry
right now but this is nice it's like you
know put it away we'll have more times
later I cannot wait to do a bunch of
summer videos people how cool is this
though this is recommended bitter tea
but with some sauce I like that it's got
this little thing here which I don't
really entirely know you know if it's
suitable like do we just do we just let
hang there Hank but a depressed penis
what do we do about it it's just coming
there
leaving it sad life but this was 15
pounds I actually think it's worth it I
think it's worth it it's not expensive I
like it it's a bit of a different team
and again as I said it's got their
nastic in it which i think is really
nice this was recommended straight after
this one I remember this what do you
guys think I like the cut the color is
it nice I feel like this color will look
nice on someone else on me I feel like
it looks quite dowdy
am I wrong I just know it looks a bit
depressive on me maybe because I've got
my dark lip on it just doesn't look nice
on me as a color but the fit the jump is
nice I like the drop sleeve again nice I
love that boohoo also recommended to me
accessories people accessories this is
nicer than I thought it was gonna be
listen it's not every day Gucci some
days is boohoo because you know there's
obviously the bum bag so I'll do Keith
at everyone's wearing but like you know
we can't all do that every day and I do
have a thing about when brands copy like
designers and stuff but man has always
been doing that from day table so
whatever this I actually think is very
nice I didn't expect it to be this nice
I did not expect it to be this nice this
is why ah this is so nice
this is so nice I'm annoyed at how nice
this is
I did not expect this Bombo to be this
cute and the materials
nice I mean obviously it's not real
leather or anything like that but some
of us and even whatever leather anyway
look at that
no I think that was 18 pounds it's not
gonna like I was unfortunately
disappointed by this recommendation or
either I saw this on new in or boo who
recommended it to me and I picked it up
you know cow print
we've got rainbow we've got Carol by the
way they have a cow print denim suit a
whole suit including the skirt that is
doing TMI too much but we're gonna try
the jacket fashion the fact that they
had a two-piece suit in capron wow
they're a two-piece suit and cow print I
don't actually hate it this is not going
to be me on a Tuesday afternoon but I
don't hate it how am I going to like it
I just wished it was short it should
have been here I thought I would think
this is ridiculous and I was wondering
why boohoo would recommend this to me
but I get it like if I found like black
and white with a bit of extra on top you
could roll with this
I think booboo was going for a thing of
recommending crazy jackets this was
another one we have ice cream cone for
eyes what's going on in fashion nowadays
just somebody tell me somebody tell me
it's crying oh I thought I thought the
ice cream cone eyes are crying right
exactly the ears that are leaking on the
front I love everything about this I
like the length of it if I can little
oversized denim shirt really okay
sometimes the recommendations I really
like this is so me this is how I do like
my casual like Rick top edges buttoned
down oversized and then the back is just
a bit cheeky and fun but I'm running
like this I think the tassels are doing
the most but I can rip the tassels off
why do I like this I don't I shouldn't
like this
but I do finally we're going to go in
sentence but where I think I must have
been looking at the nudes and this is
why this was recommended to me Oh Lord
this is giving me toe cut if there ever
was a taupe up why we segregate your
might be toe my toes are big and long
enough why they're separate section for
it I don't understand
and then when I clicked on the shoe put
it in my pocket this breast would
recommend this for me this might be like
wedding season appropriate actually this
cut is kind of nice and actually
together I had to do a scream sorry I
got so excited
this dress is nice I was thinking that
it was about to look so grandma
so Doris it was about to be a Doris
dress
we love Thomas we love Doris by the way
I'm not a gist or anything but you know
I don't want to be your kid like Doris
not yet but I thought this is a gorgeous
dress that is really nice a wedding
season the material is actually quite
nice and mybama that looks like a bullet
in a good way and give it waist Cup
they're giving me waist coverage
don't give me waist coverage because it
means I'll continue eating yes at the
wedding I can eat all the wedding cake
in the world and just just put this just
put this there you know I'm shocked
there how nice this is because when I
saw this am I recommended I wasn't
impressed I was not impressed so we went
from toe pad shoe to this but for some
reason I thought I felt like it could
work I feel like it could work but you
can wear off the shoulders get that
clavicle out listen get your sup this
dress go to little wedding and get
yourself your own husband I've got a
wedding that's happening in France and
I'm I'm about to wear my dress this is
the dress that won't to this wedding
Oh crazy this is look at my booty no
squats you know no squats feel like the
best was safe to last and very impressed
with this and my toe pop shoes I don't
hate them they're not comfortable
now never in my life would I pick up
these shoes these are recommended to me
by boohoo they are not comfortable my
toes are hanging on the outside trying
to cling on for dear life however
overall I've got saying I think this was
a great recommendation boo boo and this
dress is 20 pounds okay lovely people
that is me done that is me trying out
new in and the stuff that boo who have
recommended to me and I've got to be
honest with you I think they killed it
there were some duds just just a very
few dogs and obviously how I didn't pick
up everything they recommended to me I'm
not picking up clear Cinderella shoes
like no but some of the stuff that they
recommended I was like I wouldn't
normally pick this I don't really like
this when I put it on I was like wow it
was a really nice shock horror darlings
shock collar and I mean with the
material on the who it is hit or miss
