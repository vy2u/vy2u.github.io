Edward Scissorhands

I'm gonna let review the brands that you

first brand that I was gonna do was in
the style yeah I called it outright put
it out made an order made my order

they didn't email me or anything I know
like Oh something we think your your

isn't Manchester hello as a bit like
okay where's my order
no oh we can give you a refund or we can
be order for you I said just reorder for
me my reorder still isn't here but I
decided to spend some money on a
misguided darlings Oh Lord oh Jesus the
order the order for misguided is so big
it's come in a box right and the thing
is is that I don't really shop on
misguided anymore put your hands up if
you still shop on this guy do let me
know in the comments because I feel like
kind of boohoo put your things and take
all these other places like I'm the
stealing their shine a little bit but at
least all I can say is that I've
misguided
it's like I trust it a lot of the
clothing it looks one way on the models
and then when you bring it it's like
some tissue paper but you know sometimes
you get pink it's a really good item and
at least you're going to get your items
and made my order literally last night
by one o'clock in the afternoon I had it
delivered that is the kind of thing that
I like I like good service but you know
what we're gonna roll we're gonna check
out what I could find for misguided if
you
subscribe subscribe and this season is
my giveaway season I have loads of
beauty and items to give away to you
guys so make sure you're subscribed I
will be doing giveaways all of February
and then yeah i DM you guys so just just
be aware ok right let's get into this
video the first thing I got another this
is I really wanted this that's cool or
coke
this isn't cocky green this is so cute
it's not bad it's already oversized I
picked this up in a size 8 and it's
already oversized which I like I don't
know I quite like it I think it's nice I
thought Costa this are perfect for that
transition in and I feel like I've seen
quite a few people with this jacket I'm
not even gonna lie but I buy the jacket
if I think it's cute and I do think this
does look really nice
even with my life even with my job is I
feel like even like now this could be an
outfit not bad at all this is on the
verge of 1960 Secretariat you know what
it isn't bad let's see what this looks
like on but it is slightly giving me
secretary vibes so this was a very
random item this came in one size like
it was literally one size only do I look
like a cemetery and I swear it looks
like I am milking
look how big my boobs look why is it
literally I've got village feeders right
now do I like this I don't like this
like this but there was a reason I
bought this I wanted to wait we might
have some black trousers or black skirt
let me see if I picked up something to
wear with this because I'm like sexy
secretary with big village feeders and
but I also look very maternal in it as
well I don't know I don't know oh yes
okay I would want to pair it with
something like this these awesome lip
sorry listen people if you watch me for
long enough you know I have a thing for
leather trousers I always have every
year as
myself some little bow never trousers
and I just hope that they don't shine oh
these are not shiny you do see do you
see the vibe already what these are here
they're not even over shining I'm trying
to be relaxed and active and join you
2018 I wanted to like just turn it down
just a little bit but it's really hard
because my excitement comes from within
it's really real to match me in give me
oh give me a little waist you know see
George oh yeah I had like a vision to
wear like the top look like I was a bit
level or quite tight this isn't bad I
love these my only thing is I have to
show you guys check out the bottom of
these got like a little kick Flair going
on or maybe you just you just roll with
this kind of a little mini mini flare
trumpet going on but I love this bit and
I love the pockets and the way it comes
out this silhouette I love I think it's
cute going forward when it comes to my
trousers I need to make them how's the
crotch this is actually not bad at all
we don't have any camel as the ankle I
mean we've got some slight trumpeting
going oil however it won't kill and
actually I think it makes me look less
tooth shape than normal so we're just
gonna give the waist you know a snatch
level good okay next up is this you know
I was saying this misguided is not it's
not a cheap store anymore this is 25
pound these are 50 pounds or 40 pounds
or something like that this blaze
address and I'm living for baby blue
right now it's a gorgeous little baby
plays a dress this is 75 pounds this
better fit like for me to actually think
it's worth it
let's try it on it was all doing so well
but why is the gold so gold this is the
kind of gold I did test look at that
gold it is literally but it's the
gorgeous gold God I've ever seen it
looks like when it's sprayed on God just
be demure Oh Lord is hanging like a
flash
penis it looks like what the golden this
is so heavy
look it's hanging and like a flaccid
penis the Blazer dress is so cute it's
so cute but we have Mitchell shining
shining shining really bright gold this
is how you can get something that's
could be really cute and really stylish
to look tacky hey why is the gold this
gold
it's literally blinding I need a pair of
sunglasses to look at it and then it's
so heavy can't get it up
what the hell is that the belt needs go
ahead and grab oh my gosh I'm twisting
it I can't wait it's flapping its lucky
look at that it looks sad
tell me that doesn't is the hell let's
get rid of all of this visualize this
without all of this cute right next but
no way I got this dress because I have a
blue sleeve version of this dress
and I wanted a car key oh please beat as
good I wanted a car key one but this one
doesn't have sleeves and basically I did
a picture in this dress on Instagram a
little cute in Russia's robot Lucian
will snatch your stomach in ladies I
think it's gonna look good I think it's
gonna look good but I think that's nice
I love green as a color on me is this
Korean or is this cocky we're getting a
little brittle belly button indentation
but I have had a slice a toast so that
could be my toast coming through don't
eat rice anymore so there's no rice baby
it's just the toast but I feel like that
this I'm saying about the Russia Oman
let's just cover the belly button the
ruching creates shook like it snatches
you in snatch a little bit of leg a
little bit of boobage I'm not mad at
that I think that looks really nice so
this is basically like slinky material
I'm not I don't hate slinky material
sometimes this
quite nice this going to materials
alright it's not bad
I've got more belly then booty but I'll
take my little booty that I have and let
it come from and say hi but I got some
jeans and I got a jumper I very rarely
buy jeans from any of these website so I
wanted to see if I can find a nice pair
for misguided and then they stumbled at
really cute let's see what it looks like
on together I have concluded that most
jeans smell like bleach rain get them I
wanted jeans that were a little bit
different like they had a little bit of
personality than them I know it's not
for everyone but I like stuff like this
but I think I need a size eight Oh cute
it goes round I like the sleeves I've
been there ruched let's get this on
so the jeans actually fit alright they
fit kind of tight here loose at the knee
and then roll loose right here look at
that look at like maybe I need a tighter
size and also look the crotch is massive
as well we have just got a little bit of
a baggy Fanny going on I quite like the
crop jumper the jeans I like the multi
colors and is what the fit is they just
don't fit very well next is a jumpsuit
it's made of the material test this is
the material that you always find on
these websites is kind of like survive
in crepe material that's what it is
but sometimes it can look really nice on
my god this is a lot honestly this is an
actual lot there's caramel and there's
literally just eating eating the crop
this is what this is doing for me it is
folded unfolded it's singing it's
talking and look at the kick flare it is
ladies night we're back in Elvis
territory you know I think you know
again if you've got the body for it it
might be look for you but for me it's
just it's just a lot it's like see my
breasts see my vag see my shoulders
we're just seeing all of it will at the
same time I think this is super meant to
be a little bit higher if this was
higher I don't know what I don't know
how you'd actually breathe down below it
would be literally singing Wow so I
picked this bad boy bodysuit out of the
bag it's not even too bad it's 40 pounds
I thought this is a dress because the
weight looked on the website it was like
this top and let the matching scuffs I
thought was actually a dress I didn't
realize it wasn't a dress it's quite
nice I like the color I like the
material but the cups are massive if you
have no boobs
this ain't fit in a knee where it's an
awful it has hope but look from the side
you've almost got a full-blown nipple to
the wind like honestly it's it doesn't
fit that well but I think if you get
your exact 4d shape or tighten the
straps it might look a little bit better
it's not bad I'm not mad at it entirely
I love the material but how do you even
wash suede how that way you buy these
items you just put them in the washing
machine or do you not wash them I've
never really thought about that you know
oh this is so cute I hope this looks so
good I love these little tots like you
know it's like kind of fake Versace it's
kind of Gary she said I think this is
gonna look very nice on his face so
strange it fits all the way open what
was it doing this weed it goes all the
way down to here this is meant to tight
in the middle there is gonna be so much
censoring right now it's unbelievable
something kind of hue has no cool about
this that I kind of like this guy's that
went south really really quickly
this better be cute I bought her
favorite style of outfit it's little
crap and off-the-shoulder
you know I say about clavicle I like
this this is really cute my favorite
style is off the shoulder s Colette
Bardot and I love it when it's like
attached to the top and to my arms this
is actually really nice and what I like
is that it isn't tight here because it
has a little bit of flow which means
your stomach looks flat up because you
have more volume at the top
that is nice it was 25 pounds it's kind
of lacy this is really really nice good
where these are just some denim jeans or
something it's so cute I love the
pattern it isn't see-through we don't
have boobs coming out this is what I
expecting clothing this it's cute I love
love love this I saw this and I was like
this needs to be worn on oh just giving
me Scott nunnery rides but it looked
very sashay on the website sachet so
let's see if it's gonna look that way on
I love the neckline because it's a high
neckline but we have a bit of arm
cleavage you know we don't have to show
boobie we've got our arm and we've got
arm and leg to be honest you have a lot
but you don't have to show you that
because if you just stand it actually
covers it up
all I love is that an outfit like this
that you can look homey oh and then you
can be like do do that mm-hmm
this is cute you know what you can leave
your aspect mummy I'm here for my house
now I'm a good little girl and you're
like pal oh I love it it's a bit of a
two way dress not bad at all someone
really gave this a really harsh review
on the website and I was a bit like mmm
maybe but for me this is cute
I don't know sorry this was the dress
that someone gave a heart review they
said if you've got any form of a belly
you're literally going to look pregnant
in this dress so it was a little bit
scared but I am a fan of slinky or like
it tucks me in hopefully I have a belly
hopefully I don't look crazy
oh I love this I love this more than I
love the other dress because I prefer to
cover my arms I think this is banging
what was she talking about about Billy
I have a penny this was hidden yeah this
is better than the other one would you
guys think oh you can't tell me as you
tell me in the comments because I can
decide what to keep and what not to keep
I do love your comment I do appreciate
it this one on the one
please now look it's actually shining he
saves sweat reflection of the Sun it's
not shining it's got a sheen she boo
thee
what tell me that is it cute I think
this looks really really nice overall I
love it we have booty she yeah I love
this dress I feel like this light
actually creates a bit of an illusion it
kind of hides it you definitely can't
see the baby buttonhole oh but if we're
changing color I bought that jacket it
will show in red red or green guys let
me know oh I like the red would you guys
think this is actually slightly larger
and I like that not with the dress but
actually it could work with the dress
and they sold out like the camels and
the Browns but I didn't mind going for
like a car key in the red I'm gonna go
for the road I think I'm going for the
red guys I think it's nice we've got a
little fat butcher going on here
do you guys know you pat butcher is if
you guys watched EastEnders back in the
day she you said she was a character in
EastEnders and she always used to wear
leopard print and actually that's why I
hated people calling me Pat but you know
homage 2-pack with the leopard print
darling let's see is it gonna be doing
the most maybe have a circle honey I
think this is what this looks like
you see the thing is you can't be afraid
of breaking out this print here it looks
like looking like a bag of money II I
just made that song up looking like a
bag of money hey I don't know you can
look kind of cheap with you my leopard
print or you can look expensive
depending on the fit and I think that
this is got the balance quite well this
is my get yourself a my cougar dress I
got my own but if I was a cougar this is
what I would wear I think it's alright I
love it this is my little beach dress
like ah just walking through in my
leopard print guys I don't even know
what kind of contraption I picked up
here but I'm just gonna get it on
sometimes is doing the most and
sometimes they're just doing the most
this top looks like it's been touched by
Edward Scissorhands I wish it fit
properly but the goals are about to go
is it nice
it's kind of nice if it was smaller and
they meant to me like this
oh maybe we've got underboob here we've
got on the booth um it's it's a no it's
really you know right finally I've got
some shoes so you guys come on in let's
try some shoes firstly these boots right
here they're so cute
I know that these are a copy of the
Alexander Wang boots but when I saw the
copies on this guided I thought you know
what I might just try them oh gosh what
is going on this is really trying to not
move it's actually not moving at all I
genuinely cannot get this zip off at all
I don't know what is going on with the
zip no not working but let me show you
what the one shoe looks like on how cute
is that Bhutan ah why can I not get the
other one to open I love the detailing
and look at the shape of that hill I
love that it's so cute I will actually
go and get myself another pair next up
is this pen how cute are these I love a
sexy little lace up these are dragging
these are really nice oh look at those
so my legs are kind of dry ah tell me
these are not cute
no but look at my foot coming out the
edge I do not think these are a size 7
what the hell these are the chair size 3
their children's size but the shoe skew
the shoe is cute and this is not broke
it's like a faux leather material which
is actually a bit more comfortable than
wearing a rope that is so cute much
you're going to go and buy these in a
size set a size 7 or an 8 because I
actually like them but I don't know why
they so small okay guys alright I'm done
I decided I'm gonna do my final thoughts
right here um when it comes to shopping
I'm misguided I feel like it's 50/50 I
do feel like what you see is what you
get and some of the
is really good some of its okay I
definitely find it to be a lot better
than it used to be it's on the same
wavelength as asel swimming now and if I
want to get some really trendy stuff or
stuff for a quick holiday I know I'm
gonna be able to get some pieces that
unlike in terms of price it's not super
super cheap anymore but I kind of like
that like I do think when clothes all
right 10 pounds 5 pounds 15 pounds and
then a little bit iffy about that
because do you know what clothes don't
need to be that that's that cheap 30
pounds what balance is okay and it means
that you buy it a little less and I
think when clothing is really cheap you
end up just keeping everything even if
you don't need it well if it's less
cheap you only get like one or two
things which I kind of appreciate a
little bit more overall I would go to
misguided it's a very safe website to go
to it's very safe some things I hid some
things I miss is by at least and I'm
gonna get my clothing when I do these
Indians and then make sure I'm trying to
be as helpful as possible it's almost
like you know it's consumer awareness
I'm helping y'all you're helping me help
me decide what clothing to keep or not
to keep and in the meantime you can
follow me on my Instagram because I
didn't give away tour this season make
