a little to no material hello there
beautiful people welcome back to my
channel I hope you are doing well I got
a little extra video for you today and
this was a good one because I've let you
guys take over you're taking over honeys
I decided to let you guys as my
subscribers pick my outfits and I've
been doing a lot of shopping and you
guys have been doing a lot of
recommendations but I wanted to see if
you guys had it like that as well you
know I wanted it to pick to me some
outfit I purchasable they've arrived and
I want to see how good I'm gonna look
maybe you guys can pick better for me
then I can pick for myself so I asked my
followers on Twitter and Instagram to
send me over their recommendations
send me over pictures send me over
styles I feel like some people are
sending over stuff that they wanted to
buy for themselves but they weren't sure
and there were some of you guys who were
just trying to make a mockery out of me
you just wanted my reaction but it's
okay
it's okay cuz there are enough cute
items I think for me to actually wear so
basically I use my own coin when it
comes to doing these videos so I'm very
happy to be sponsored today by 21
buttons it is a fashion sharing app you
can get it on iPhone and Android and
basically it makes shopping looks really
easy it's a great way to discover our
trends and outfits people like me have
got like profiles on there or other
influencers or bloggers even like your
friends may have profiles on 21 buttons
you basically have clickable links that
allow you to purchase items straight
away and I know it can be really
annoying when you see someone wearing a
cute outfit and you're like where is
that from and then you can't find the
link you can find outfit this basically
combats that entire issue if you're
someone who just wants to get out for
you like listen I need the goods this
app is gonna be for you I'll have it in
the description bar below but thanks to
them for sponsoring this video let's get
right into it

worry rusty right now because I'm tired
I'm tired and my job my pajamas too
early in the day but it's all good I'm
gonna shop you like guys these goodies

tweeted I want to see what you guys
picked out for me okay so this is the
treat I wrote so I'm gonna shoot a video
where I get my followers and subscribers
to pick my outfit send over your
suggestions I'm really hoping that you
guys ain't dogging me I've seen a couple
of notifications out like wow and then
some I was like okay so I'm gonna see
what I could find
Oh Chanel Chanel well you got good taste
girl because I already picked up this
jumpsuit and yeah I already did a video
wearing it so we don't need to see that
on Ash as you don't want me to be great
to you my question is how does she have
all this support how is it so rigid what
happens when your arms go down this is
one Beetlejuice trapeze ex
nooglers Cruces fight outfit okay Nancy
Nancy from River Island is it sequins
I think it's sequins Diana no girl no to
be honest at least that will give me
like a waistline bearing in mind that I
have a relatively square shape which I'm
proud of like when you need electrical
appliances to actually wear a pair of
trousers then it's not gonna be for you
or for me Jasmine why human sorry
extreme cut out jeans for one hundred
and sixty eight dollars for little to no
material
do you know what I'm not even offended
that you suggested these I'm offended by
the price these need to be three dollars
because there was three dollars worth of
material whoo-hoo in the white and the
way well yeah they're extreme extreme
you might see that in the corner yeah
Jasmine you should be so many thanks
sorry I'm gonna see if I can find those
but I don't think I'm gonna be able to
let's have a look have this made listen
Vanessa I love you and everything you're
gonna think I don't have a personal
tailor not yet anyway this is a nice
little outfit I swear I need to wear my
more African print stuff I do have a few
pieces for someone getting ready but I
don't have a tailor a little goodie from
a zooss it's weird this is your idea of
normal then girl I don't know what I
don't know but I'm gonna pick that up
we need our words you need to 5-pound
cheaper on nasty girl well exposure Oh
seven seventy five pounds for ten so I
can be a walking Christmas tree thanks
pretty little things there's something
about it that it's also kind of cute
though I feel like I need to see what
this looks like on Oh talking of nasty
girl is nasty girls still around zero s
given no buckle read on public your
boyfriend I see better no I am NOT the
kind of girl who do that to another girl
no power that's on my street well
it's called fashion darling fashion
oh well Angie okay drama okay guys I am
done I've seen some other items and also
picked some items that people share with
me on Twitter
hopefully my items coming to it and I'll
shoot them okay ready to go the first
storm someone recommended something from
what
Muskego to be honest I thought nasty
girl was gone I saw it trying to do into
a resurrection so I was quite surprised
this t-shirt right here it stood out to
me and this t-shirt says puts the power
puts power so yeah not something I would
normally pick up but I'm sure that we've
got a song about power ladies over
there who are like Patricia you need to
wear guess whoa okay as I'm
grabbing if I do feel like a little bit
like you know strong I hate what
t-shirts look like on me when they're
like just down but you know as soon as
you put like a little young not in the
t-shirt it makes such a big difference
just like pi to fly um this is cute
would I wear this yeah would like a
little casualty yeah why not
Percy power and what if I read this out
about I wonder what kind of looks you
get when you walk around like IKEA in my
complicity shirt
okay so this set I saw I was a bit like
listen you want me to be mission there
or something and this is like a two
piece set about you from River Island I
found the right link to where I didn't
even realize it was sweet prince
mm-hmm not something I would normally
pick up and sex Oh Lord
it's very wanna be sure now okay let's
see what this looks like on
I'm pleasantly surprised because I kind
of like this I like the way the skirt
fits I like the way the scarf it I like
the way this looks on it's weird
especially because we have 80s shoulder
pads in here giving me up most like I
kind of like it I think it's alright
this is from River Island I believe and
I think it actually quite KITT could you
wear this to a wedding no you can't wear
this to a wedding cuz this it's kind of
white and it is kind of a lot calm but I
don't hate this I do not hate this I
think that the two of them together is a
bit much bear in mind this is all sequin
okay it's a lot but I thought the skirts
quite nice just pray itself and I like
the witness but the skirt fit it's kind
of like a not a mine but kind of an
a-line the arms are doing a madness like
the shoulder pads over here are giving
me literally American football players
shoulders and I do not need to add to my
shoulders right now you could get rid of
the shoulder pads and look kind of cool
I don't know I like it is it just me or
is this in my head I was about to slate
the person who picked this me but I
actually like this girl he did a good
job I feel like the skirt like just by
itself or like a nice little top would
be nice with the jacket it's doing the
most but I do think like on its own this
gets quite nice I wouldn't expect it to
like that or to think that that would
have looked good on black I think it
does the skull itself does it makes me
feel cute it makes me feel happy and fun
and free and that's a nice meeting so
this is another subscriber picks outfits
is just doing a lot of pattern a lot of
color a lot of it's really good it's
just really girly this is not something
I would ever look at that there's blue
and green not colors that I normally
wear but let's see if I could be cute
let's see if this is going to be cute
I feel like it could be nice at a
wedding like how do you feel okay if
you're someone who likes pattern and a
lot this could be nice
the fit is really nice the fit is really
nice the shape of this is really nice
for like a dress but you wear to a
wedding like the fit and shape is nice
look at this little peplum here going on
the pattern is like but why but the fit
look at the fit
it's so nice I love the shape it gives
me and everything but I'm popping
everything it looks so nice all of this
is gorgeous but this is just too much do
you didn't need to put it all ah I feel
like someone would like this and look
amazing in this I would be doing the
most the actual most if I like rocked up
at your wedding it is like hey I've got
four outfits in one arm baby girl
it aggression oh this is cute all the
seats are short and also I remember this
recommendation I feel like someone from
Germany recommended me and they sent me
a link to like the German address
website and then it redirected me today
you came outside and this is the bad boy
we picked up from ASOS I think this is
the me nice on this is very much my
style I think is it I think you know but
we're in the dress season you guys
really like a dress I love it
I'm gonna wear this this is staying in
my wardrobe I love it it's so cute
wear it the pair of boots that's some
cute boots this to me is a vibe in terms
of like my own personal style I love
this oh my gosh I love this I love this
oh brother this feels like some boots a
little black hold on let me just let me
just make this a nappy I'm getting
really excited now Oh like oh like like
a work vibe but cool but like an event
I'm going to and I'm gonna walk out like
these
sorry I just realized what this is about
this is I'm so selfish when I do videos
I'm actually doing videos for myself and
this has just made me so happy
this is Mitchie what it's like if
someone buys you a present and you
really like the present this myself but
it's fine this fine you pick this amigos
you pick this for me oh this is bad
isn't this enough ah what a quick dick
you get a shiny you get shiny okay so
this item here looks like some kind of
origami origami I'm tissue paper like
all together I feel like a bird of prey
I feel like I should be taking flight
somewhere I mean no this bit has lost
its mind like it's like hey hey I'm not
sure what I want to do I like the way
this bit and I'm not gonna lie like I
love the details of the ruching on this
it's so cute
but I feel like for me this doesn't even
see me who would this suit you really
have to be someone with this kind of
extra vibe but this is so cute like I
don't know how they did that how do they
do that I love how that I look like a
hot is it a harmonica I don't like that
scene let it go but as I walk I'll be
making that sound what is that thing
called I can't remember not a harmonica
but like a good that for sure this is
enough yeah yeah I saw a lot of
multicolored rainbow extremely shiny
things
my way and that was wow this is actually
just a tinsel is this color something
about it's nice though I can be like a
black Christmas tree I get it festival
season is here but this is actually a
tinsel outfit how much was this outfit
this place 70 pounds okay let's see what
this looks like on Wow
this is really a wow this one is a while
this is a this one is this one is dude
the most we had rainbow a few weeks back
and now we have tinsel jacket do you
know what do you honestly know what and
kind of feeling it I am genuinely kind
of feeling it this is bad up I wish that
you couldn't see the white like this bit
which I could tuck that away listen I
would just come in you couldn't miss me
in this jacket look at the movement I
think there's something that color that
makes me feel good like whenever I'm in
a bright color I feel good I would wear
this to like a festival
we like some short shorts this is
something in my life I would never pick
up and also you probably never wear in
all honesty but it's a bit of fun
anyone is looking for fresh that work
outfit this isn't a bad choice this is
definitely Joseph's Technicolor
Dreamcoat so one of the things someone
recommended to me extreme distress denim
jeans these jeans actually went viral
I'm gonna just picture them right here
because the a hundred and sixty thousand
dollars you could get zero material and
your ass crack on show and people paying
for the privilege for doing this
yeah thanks for recommending that to me
but no I'm not going to be demonetized
because of the ass crack jeans however I
did find some extremely distressed
genes which are kind of similar and to
Venus I personally don't really like
extremely distressed jeans I just think
they look kind of scruffy on me
personally but I thought let me at least
rock these to give you guys the same
effect but without all that cheek on
show the really annoying thing about G's
like this is that literally your toes
get stuck in every single hole possible
like to get them on you lose a toe
losing toes as I do this not only are
these jeans ugly and distressed they are
also in fitting these are so ill-fitting
big actually don't fit that's all let's
just have a board it looks so pitiful
from the back to be honest how many of
you guys who have really distressed
jeans like this let me know like there's
no shame in it but it's like I can't
fathom paying full price with jeans with
half of the material like are we doing
this are we really doing this but there
you go there you go you try to get me in
to monetize but you know here's an
alternative I don't think I'm gonna go
over to the extreme distress Jean
territory because for me it's a no okay
so guys there's definitely an obsession
with rips these will recommend it to me
quite a bit
oh my gosh these have the weirdest the
weirdest sensation going on it feels
weird oh god it feels so strange it
feels like actually like I'm wearing
those support pants that kind of cup
your bum that's what it's oh god she
looks like a mistake it looks like your
pants ripped and you didn't know that's
what it looks like was a big mistake
something happened you sat on flames
2,080 enemy do you know what to be quick
be honest of you I don't
they're quite like them I quite like
them
I should never actually kind of cute if
you like Nick barn to be one I feel like
Jessica Simpson and then like 19 I maybe
it's just that these jeans are actually
a really flattering fitting pair of
jeans and then they happen to just be
torn extremely at the booty I'm very
interested to see how people react to
these out and about yeah do you guys
wear jeans that have the booty rips
thanks for subscriber for recommending
me I would never ever ever ever ever
pick ripped jeans but I don't despise
them directly from the back in look to
looks like I sat on a fire so all my
elegant subscribers I love you this
looks elegant
I think this trusty little number was
from Azoff I think the bus they pick
this also pick the white top as well
they have make this cup nice style I was
feeling your very fash on let's get this
on I love the color I feel like I'm
wearing a sack of potatoes
right now it's a nice jump that the
sweater materials fantastic it's just
very a genetical wizard this is like my
wizard cape or like shiny the wand this
is very Harry Potter esque
isn't a bit if you're thinking about
buying this for yourself it's very hot
you don't need it for summer if you're
into wizardry maybe this could be fear
ah I definitely think this is someone
who's going to a wedding they wanted a
recommendation I think even really like
this just feel always bought this dress
it's like a little lace number you can't
wear this to a wedding though can you
you can I don't like to people's
weddings before but you never know like
some Brides they don't mess around with
that you know they'll rip the white off
your dress this is nice
in all honesty if they're not made very
well but it does look nice on I like
this shape it's given me this very
babydoll bit too maybe don't actually
bit too baby though I am too grown to be
wearing something as baby dolls this is
giving me visions of my past as a kid I
like the fit though I like the way it
fits on but the materials are fantastic
so what do you think I do think it suits
me I think it's all right not my
personal style but I think what we're
switching up I feel really cutesy in
this like really cutesy not only is this
a print
it's come friend chat in my life I have
never how'd you even wear chaps I have
never worn
taps before how do you even wear them do
you wear them with you ever recommended
this to me Evan loves me very much
or hates me let me know what do you guys
think
no let's not like I feel like we've all
got the one fantasy to try something
like this huh is it just me is it just
me maybe it's like you know I would
never this is not part of any I don't
know which culture this is part of I
think right Tara boys wear this stuff I
don't even know I'm not from America I'm
sorry but oh if something that seems so
indecent about them it's just because
the crotchal area is so exposed to the
wind right now I'm feeling such a breeze
and it feels really unnatural because
all of his covered in his covered but
there's just this direct breeze also too
like my bar I've actually got these
actual like short shorts on so it isn't
that bad some people actually have their
whole cheeks out and I'm not about to do
that so I'm just gonna wear them like
this it it does seem like a little bit
of a cheeky outfit I really hope this
isn't becoming a thing in England I saw
these on pretty little things what I
in cow prints a cow please
chaps you know I'm gonna give my
subscribers the ingenious you have to
find these to fight to fight enough in
the whole of the world of all the things
around with these I'll give you a crap I
will get let alone the fact that they're
like even too long tonight I feel I feel
kind of cool I feel like I'm having fun
in these like no no I'm lying
oh yeah thanks guys so guys that is me
