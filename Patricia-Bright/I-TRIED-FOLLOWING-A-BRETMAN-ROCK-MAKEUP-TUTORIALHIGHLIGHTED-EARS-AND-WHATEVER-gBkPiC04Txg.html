enough for thursday and now we're also
highlighting is he is oh Jesus
hello there beautiful people welcome to
my channel I hope you are doing well
today I'm jumping on the bandwagon and I
am going to do so do my makeup like
someone else's makeup and I am going to
do greteman hair
rocks I think he is absolutely hilarious
he doesn't upload on youtube like loads
and loads maybe like once a month maybe
a little less and but he's on Instagram
and he's just
Alaric's he's so funny and he can
actually slay makeup really well and so
I decided you know I'm gonna do the kids
because as I was watching his video I
was just laughing and I wanted to do
someone who's completely left field but
who I genuinely enjoy I spent a lot of
late nights undercover a lot of thing
everything he puts on Instagram and he's
just the cutest so we're gonna go ahead
and copy miss the Brett moon rock just
watching hey bitch it's me breven Rock
and today I will be doing my make you
make a plus app look that you guys voted
for on Twitter as a matter of fact let
me see how many votes
bujji got it got 57% this makeup
tutorial is cool bougie we go in with
the kills ultra facial cream it has
sunscreen in it all the way tonight you
still need more shirt okay so first
thing he's starting off with moisturizer
that's a good place to start
he's using the chaos facial moisturizer
I don't have that so I'm gonna go in
with my bubbly Brown vitamin enriched
face base by the way he does swear a lot
he does use them Emma
everyone only after every other word
once you have the moisturizer on your
face you're gonna go in with a primer
today I'm gonna be using the wires Oh
Torchic ha
so I'm gonna be good you know what to be
honest I find it difficult to say he is
going in with the YSL Touche Claw
blurring primer I actually do have so I
forgot how good that primer is it feels
amazing that's maybe good I don't have
the Make Up For Ever foundation so I'm
gonna go in with huda beauty which has a
matte finish which is kind of similar oh
and he applies it the foundation
directly onto his face verse I never
applied my foundation at this I don't
know how I fry it I always dip my
blender onto the back of my hand now
time to conceal the areas where I need
to conceal and that is my beard period
again so I don't have a beard area to
conceal but I'm not gonna lie I've got a
little bit of a mustache going on so I
might follow this day I'm taking the
lucky concealer bro
okay so you taking the locket Foundation
which I think it's quite full coverage
so I'm gonna go in with my Dior this is
the Dior forever under cover full
coverage and it's quite close to my skin
tone no not I might as well just do the
beard area anyway do you know I'm liking
the fact that I just did a little
something to my slightly dark area
now we're gonna highlight the face you
think of a pro conceal by a little girl
cosmetics this is in creation and I'm
just gonna use that underneath the eye
it's going in with the ennogard that was
my favorite go-to but I've cleared out
my eye makeup collection and I don't
have the LA girl anymore but an
affordable highlight our concealer that
I like is the makeup of revolution for 4
pounds these are just as good as the LA
girl ones probably not as thick but
really good I'm gonna go with seaters a
little light but it's okay cuz I'm gonna
mix it with the market Foundation okay
he mixed it with a slightly darker one
so I'm gonna do that as well suppose he
didn't like do his nose I always do my
nose okay time to blend okay yeah we've
got our base on I feel very much like a
bull chicken or an egg cuz my eyebrows
are not done so let's see what he's
gonna do next now that we have the base
of our face on or the liquid on we are
gonna bake the face using the
translucent medium deep from Laura
Mercier my god yes I love this
translucent powder dark and light he
said I have the medium deep as well
maybe he's got medium but I do find it a
bit dark for my under eyes so like he
did I will be mixing it let's do a mini
haul today I got four things from
Sephora I just bought in the middle of
the makeup tutorial he does stop I did a
whole just just the middle of the makeup
tutorial just did it another kind of
video wow is that well I'm gonna mix
laura mercier with the map Patrick Starr
collabo oh my god let's see if I throw
the same way not me already it looks
cute it looks cute
he's powdering down the side of his nose
as well for little contour I can't
believe there's no like middle of the
nose action I feel weird cuz I never I
always do something down my nose with a
big brush he went in and powdered the
rest of his face with it I never do this
honestly I don't actually pounder that
much and I just felt very proud of it
and I'm getting bored and Bulldog where
are my eyebrows they're disappearing
now I'm gonna do my eyebrows off camera
because I don't think I could do this
with the pressure of you watching me
yeah I'm gonna go off camera real quick
so he did his brows off-camera
nice you know the pressure of you guys
watching okay it's actually true because
someone will insult your eyebrows so I'm
gonna do one of camera I don't need
powder on my face this long I'm not a
huge Baker but his is just sitting there
bacon so we're gonna do that he went in
with a Mac Paint Pot I don't have that
one but I do have another one so we're
just gonna go with that I use the master
palette by Mario and Lube Ian's by
Julia's the merrier palette mine is been
through the works this palette got a lot
of love telling you oh my god
and I don't have the nubian palette but
I do have this palette this is the
Sahara palette by Julia's play I think I
can make it work I think he went in with
kind of like more of a like Daisy
like base I'm just gonna go with this
because I feel like this it's good to
know how to describe the eyes like I did
not take anatomy for eyes bitch I don't
know what creates
I did not take Anatomy for eyes
they said this is how I feel like some
of these makeup tutorials are like being
in biology class on this leap the crease
the labia what is it what is it you're
just dotting no one here is the bottom
part mainly oh my gosh he's doing what I
did test I hate putting dark colors on
my lid and he's going in with a black
eyeliner as a base he used a black
eyeliner Cole I'm gonna use a brown one
and then be confident I'm gonna go with
the black then use this from Bobbi Brown
okay this is harder than I expected
he had a mess trying to blend that I
don't know how I'm gonna do it it's a
mess and then he's gone in with Rio
letter from this palette and I'm gonna
put that on top of the black oh it does
what it actually genuinely works that
looks a lot stronger than it normally
looks for me you know what that is very
interesting I am not mad to blend out
all of the edges
bitch ain't nobody won alive she's so
funny now it's time to wipe off the big
bitch this has been baking forever
finally we can wipe off the bake because
it's been baking forever
honestly I feel like a Sanjay when I
bake for this long I feel so dry and my
under eyes look so wrinkly oh my god he
went it was an eyeliner I don't ever use
like an eyeliner so I'm gonna use
highbrow and hopefully it's fine honey
is out of my eye this is how people end
up suing you know because you use a
product in the way you're not meant to
use it don't do this but it's cute or
whatever so to contour and bronze I'm
going to be using the terra cotta by
golly to contour he went in with some
Guerlain bronzer I'm not going to go I
need to use like a dark powder so this
is from bareMinerals
and this is their bear Perry foundation
powder which I love to use to contour
he's snatching his drawer so so step
thought I don't really do a lot there we
go and then let that fake I'm just gonna
put this where I would highlight and
where I want the highlight to hit this
is super like skin like Casey's be fancy
going in with the Tom Ford illuminating
highlight our night me I'm gonna go when
now I love this illuminating palette
it's light but you can build it up he is
oh Jesus he highlighted his forehead but
for me highlighting my forehead is it
going to work maybe I should just blend
it a little bit more the highlighter we
are gonna fit with
to set the highlight up we're gonna say
it with more highlighter all right fix+
to the rescue I don't like really know
why people use this for like like they
literally pay four times on like bitch I
drenched my businesses like it's what we
need to drench ourselves in this
drenched drenched ryan gonna go in with
pen TBT I'm gonna go with the killer
walk I feel like these two are gonna get
that same bleep you spray that fixmas
she is saying hey he's got the chin a
lot of guys are waiting for this moment
so we are gonna highlight my ears
together what what i felt quite
highlighted enough for thursday and now
it also highlighting is sony it's a new
door to makeup let's just get my ears
out oh my god my ears no one ever sees
my ears like why my is a highlighted
because bright blue bra hi lysis is my
forehead time I did darling you're
fabulous and you're gorgeous
I need to turn it down a bit cuz you
know I have to go pick up my baby from
nursery and I think people are gonna be
like what you and the hell is this girl
and a little to the Bourbon if he honest
he doesn't look very you were gold he
looks very you are gold his highlight is
really pop in so I feel like I am
getting the britman hook I really feel
like I am JD weighty lips beauty
finally some nose contour
oh my god his nose highlight it's insane
what if it slightly more silverish Wow
God if it's a beam of my day I'm just
gonna go me this man if we're gonna go a
bit more silverish so for blush he went
in seemed kind of peachy quite bright so
I'm gonna go in with this blush from
Dior I use this everyday bitch every day
of my life when I breathe when I wake up
like I just use it for everything like
if I'm dying
but if he's dying he's gonna be buried
for that lippy it looks dark it looks
vampy gonna see if I've got something
similar in my collection I'm not gonna
lie I love this shade of lipstick I love
a dark vampy lip like this to me it also
looks like he put on some mascara
beforehand but didn't show us on camera
so I'm gonna go ahead and put some
mascara especially on these lower lashes
they need them the only thing that is
missing is the lashes he had a coupon
code for lashes I don't but I'm loving
these lashes are so cute
okay guys my finish look
Chino up Brett make you kind of killed
it because I actually feel way more
dramatic than normal but I feel like
it's come together and looks quite nice
this is definitely instagramming makeup
and I feel like if I took a picture it
would look quite flawless for like the
gram and stuff in person it's very
highlighted boy I am glistening like the
Sun I am shine and shine in but overall
I don't think it was bad at all like
cheese but you know what but men can
play makeup you know and he got the
booty look down and having to be able to
recreate it slightly differently than I
would normally do that so shout out to
him because I feel like he's made me
look extra spicy so yeah what do you
guys think do you like it am i giving
you that Brickman diva or whatever like
extra vibe like hey hey I can't do it
I'm so bad or whatever you know yeah I'm
