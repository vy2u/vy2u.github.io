speak up some things occurs listen well
they're lovely people welcome to my
channel today I wanted to do a get ready
with me and we're gonna be using some
k'kaw beauty and for some reason I feel
a little bit like yeah it's quite
controversial to qkw beauty because it
just is one of those brands and I'm
gonna call it a brand that people kind
of love to hate and in some situations I
do think it is a good cause but I think
it's nice to just try the product and
see what you think and I what like Kim
has taking some Elle's and done some
things recently that I have kind of
given her this side I add however you
know we go to maybe have a chitchat
about that while we get ready maybe I'll
do that and you know I do try and steer
away from things are dramatical but I do
know that sometimes you just have to
speak on something because listen I will
say that I only have the contour stick I
know I'm late in the game however I live
in England right and I'm telling you
that it took four weeks for the products
to arrive so the highlighters that the
powder version has just come out
probably I receive it in six weeks from
now and if I make an order but you know
I'm gonna decide if I'm gonna make an
order off the back of what do I think
beans are like and obviously this is the
initial packaging and I mean the color
is cute I like the idea of like a
package in but was it to me does it look
like it was potentially a way of saving
some money yes it does now first and
says I'm going to go in with my
foundation I'm gonna go in with the
Lancome this is the 10th miracle but
actually a little bit more of a Julie
foundation that I'm kind of feeling at
the moment I thought will be interesting
to have a discussion in regards to write
drama on the internet
you know celebrity non-celebrity and
it's really hard like where I'm not in
my position not I mean like an amazing
position
anything I'm very much a normal person
but you cannot necessarily just say what
you feel not that what you can't say
what you feel but you have to be
cautious because there's always
different camps where people have
different you know perspectives and I
think in life is really important to
look up everybody's perspective before
drawing a conclusion I think you know
with Kim specifically like she
protential II you know spoke too soon
before knowing what she was talking
about and the good thing I say is that
she obviously you know was apologetic
you know whether or not you want to
accept someone's apology that is a
personal decision to you okay
foundation done going in with this the
ingredients are on the back of this
piece of plastic
the kit is inside this F air lock bag
and I think my initial thought is which
is similar to everybody's thought which
is there's not a lot of product here
it's quite small I'll give it that it's
unique I haven't really seen anyone
packaged their stuff in this way women I
think it's a good thing is here to be
here to be discussed so the first thing
I'm going to use is the deep dark
highlights huh I'm not sure what this is
this is this looks like a color
corrector versus a highlight is very
peach so maybe put this on before I
wouldn't I wouldn't highlight with
something like this but it is kind of
blending in but is quite just peachy
okay we know we all know that that
happens I didn't expect it to happen so
so quickly we're just going to push it
back in and go I'm not going to make you
look good to make a feature of that
because we've all seen it we all know it
happens right although it caught me by
surprise it did catch me by surprise I'm
not gonna lie I'm sorry
rip like wet paper we're just going to
blend in this peachy highlighter
what's runny enough do you know what it
isn't actually that off I would say it's
really creamy and blends nicely but it's
not giving me any highlight so what
we're gonna do what we gonna do is go in
with Kevyn Aucoin
so this is more like the shade I would
wear under my eyes versus this kind of
shade it's got a compliment my actually
my actual skin tone in regards to like
the beauty world and on YouTube as well
I do think it is changing a lot and I
think it's interesting to see that it
does feel like people are entering in
but possessing a money opportunity which
I don't think there's anything wrong
with that in the slightest like you
don't make your money however if you're
gonna do it your product has to burn and
I think if someone has a product that is
subpar it's gonna get blasted and women
a day in age that if you do something
wrong people are going to call you out I
think it's a good thing as long as
people aren't just you know burning
people just because they can now there
are some people who deserve to be called
everyone also has the right to defend
themselves as well
okay so right I'm going to go in with
the contour now this is really what
matters because the highlight the peach
highlight was not working for my skin so
let's just go in with a contour and this
is the deep dark and there's two darker
shades and I'm very surprised at how
dark they are they're very nice they're
actually very nice very creamy and what
we're not going to do is roll them up to
the top because that is asking for
trouble and this side is a more of a
cooler contour very very very very very
nice contour color love it very creamy I
have a matte contour stick that I really
really like and this is actually very
very similar to that I actually think
the shade and this is better and I like
the shape of this because this is way
easier to contour my nose because of the
shape it's a great shape but the reality
is list
there is nothing but a negative size of
product in here there isn't a lot you're
not getting a lot for your money here no
this is not a bargain at all all right
oh and Francis this isn't the cooler
side but this does look it looks like
it's probably a bit too dark for me
because it's coming out some kind of
dark brown gray I might use the one
that's for the nose
it works really well as a nose contour
but as a face cotton to contour
personally I find it too too cold and
then we're going to go in with the brush
that I know has been insulted to the
high heavens including for her new
collection is Q it's like dense this
looks like absolute nonsense so I'm just
I'm just gonna need this side because
you know it's been dissed enough I'm
gonna go in with the brush this little
thing I think it's a little bit dinky
but I don't hate it I don't I decide I'm
not gonna bother with it because I think
intensely see it's just not about it's
not gonna be great but this wasn't
actually that bad for blending however I
will say that this brush is the reason
that the product is slightly on the
higher price side then she could
definitely get rid of this and just
stick with personally the contour kit
that's my opinion but I'm gonna go back
in with the highlight and see what kind
of highlight is gonna give me oh like I
actually like this you can come in with
quite a lot of it because it is quite
subtle I've got a bit hangs I felt like
it needed it because it blends in it
blends in - nothing is actually blends
into nothing I wanted to sing you are
gold you are golden you're not God you
are blending into nothing copy a lot
more gentle and just it's quite nice
like on my swatch it's really nice on my
hand it's like really nice and Goldy but
maybe it's so creamy it just evaporates
next I'm gonna go with my Kat Von D this
is my shade and light palette so pilot I
just can't seem to get enough off and I
swear is like my everyday and it lasts
really long immerses clear don't
actually wear that much makeup anyway I
like to say keep it positive keep it
classy but sometimes I know we've all
got you know an opinion to be hand and I
think everybody deserves to be heard a
hundred percent
well next this just fell out of the
entire pan anyway this is from Sephora
don't know why that happened that is a
really nice cute like Freddie brown I
really like what about products
breaking all over the place what why is
this happening
everybody reset your product right now
today I'm joking I am kidding Brittany
I've also been loving like a creamy
white or a beige e eyeliner I've been
living for this this is from Kiko but I
don't know where the pencil is so chunky
but I feel like it looks cute on and
then want to use my Laura Mercier powder
just for the rest of my face cuz it's
just a little bit shiny this highlighter
is literally dissipated into nothing
actually nothing so I'm just gonna go in
with this Hilah from Maybelline maybe I
can use the highlight stick for on my
nose that would be cute
it's not even impressive on my nose
honestly then I'm gonna go with
bittersweet on my lips which is a really
nice warm Brown and this matte liquid
lip this shade is carnation from the
body shop so she could become my
favorite shade it's really smooth and
it's really really really creamy then a
little bit of blush this is from
Anastasia Beverly Hills
okay guys blushes that is unfinished or
look get rid of me
featuring k'kaw beauty I mean everyone
my views of that it's okay I wouldn't
say they're bad I would definitely say
that for the money they cost you're not
really getting very much they're more
like travel-size kind of toy sized items
so yeah I do think that the brush isn't
amazing I do really like the creaminess
and actually the color of the contour
kit and the highlight kinda dissipated
into thin air
so it's a note for me but it's not awful
would I be wearing the new contour kit
I'm unlikely to because I've already got
the sticks match I prefer more of a
cream contour anyway this wasn't amazing
and I've seen some of the reviews and
what people have been trying and the
product again hasn't quite hit the mark
my honest opinion is though I'm not
gonna lie I do feel I do feel some type
of way I feel like it's a case of and
I've been doing like YouTube Beauty
videos fashion videos for a long time
like I've been here pre partnership pre
subscribers pre monetization
before all of that existed so for me I
can see that you know certain people are
coming on board because it's a
moneymaker for them I kind of feel like
that
k'kaw beauty is also kind of coming in
in the same breath and I don't think
there's anything wrong with that I am
not mad at somebody who wants to make a
coin but I think it's really important
if you're gonna do that that you really
do consider the the community that is
here because I feel like if you're on
YouTube like people are passionate
people aren't really real about this
stuff and if you like not offend them
but if you if you try to take them for
fools they might end up telling you
about yourself but you know everybody
deserves chances so I feel like I start
like Kim not everybody deserves a second
chance
not everybody some people would
dickheads for life so yeah I'm just
gonna leave it at that
so guys thank you for watching and I'll
see you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
