my channel I hope you are doing well I'm
currently still enjoying sunny you were
say and guys if you don't know 60% of my
followers are actually from USA so now
that I've been here I haven't realized
that you can basically go into a beauty
stores such as Sephora or auto top and
do you not play this right or growt test
the makeup and basically beat your face
without someone giving you the side-eye
of life normally if I go to Selfridges
or boots and I'm by the you know that
makeup area for too long someone's
coming everything can I help you miss
you nobody suspect no I'm alright thank
you then you're not walking on they give
you that look off like move on darling
move on Oh bye where's he is that you
can do a fool beat you can go to a prom
from Sephora what so we're gonna finish
the hell out of Sephora roundabout now
we're gonna Joanna scammer it I'm gonna
go in looking like this we're we're just
gonna call it a three with eyelashes I
might need to come out like a twelve
ever okay so we're gonna do that if you
are not already subscribed to my channel
make sure you subscribe and look and if
you can follow me on my snapchat my
Twitter my Instagram especially if you
want to see behind the scenes of what's
actually going on in my life and I
actually Phoenix in the streets of LA
let's do this let's go so finesse in
Sephora means that you well there goes
there
finessing crew yeah Vanessa Sephora
requires you know being inconspicuous
so Jimmy eyewear we have round number
one is this inconspicuous enough I don't
know I don't think so oh oh this hair is
kagan is this this service to you isn't
it but I don't know if it's you know
it's not inconspicuous but it's adorable
yes I feel like I'm just gonna rock
these anyway so I went out and about and
hit the streets and in all honesty I was
worried about sanitation so I hit the
7-eleven to find IVA some alcohol spray
or some gel or some wipes that I could
use on the Sephora makeup myself because
I wasn't really sure what setup they had
in store so I arrived at Sephora and I
was feeling a little bit nervous but I
wasn't playing my face is bare and I
wanted to come out looking cute so
here's my before foundation I feel like
I'm gonna go for the full cover
so I went to milk makeup first because I
wanted the primer but I'm not gonna lie
the sight of that Wow
I wasn't sure man I wasn't sure gonna
try a little Sephora Oh bride concealer
shade I need clothes maybe oh that is
full coverage it's kind of shiny though
that feels gross rubbing out my face
vice okay we're here now I'm simply
doing
hmm I'm hoping we're not gonna get
kicked out but any new brushes this way
let's do it with our hands
under pressure
what do you know this foundation
I feel under pressure it was looking
kind of weird
is it blending or me the finger hot
lands so at this point in time I was
feeling kind of under pressure and like
I had to brush number one I had kind of
security kind of just watching me a
little bit they saw me they were cool
they didn't approach or anything but you
know I just felt a little 10 and
secondly I couldn't find any brushes so
I was having to apply this cost get
ready foundation with my hands so people
using mascara as well how the day has
been safe there's a makeup sponge
constructed with my belt your hands we
are deep happy security on their
walkie-talkies
we look very we're just gonna keep going
I need to clean it we need to sanitize
people this isn't work in the press room
I think it's super amazing that in
Sephora you can basically get ready
they've got these stations with sponges
spoonie's tools sanitation wipes
everything you need to try the makeup
before you buy it I need some powder
because I'm little shiny I'm gonna go
and try this from bareMinerals
well-rested Engler the weather we have
this
can actually sell for eyelashes and
these are the lower lashes that I love
well they're having me hey look
am i snatched look at this man how crazy
they I can actually see here but my
fault I'm finishing off right I need
some powder I'm just gonna go with this
on
let me fix it it's not on me I don't
know what kind of harder that is but I'm
gonna start again yeah I kind of believe
that this isn't coming off so I'm just
going to do it again
but back to base again after the
disaster and I'm gonna use this
bareMinerals
concealer but I love this in the contour
when a front or the data I'm gonna try
this Smashbox
yeah this looks like it might be alright
I'm not feeling the release notes
my goal was basically to try and do my
full face as I normally would with
products that were a little bit
different and as you can see if mmm this
feel like I look like a ghost
that goes for alcohol on this and I'm
using this I actually like the way that
that line has gone on sanitizing and
applause I feel like it's really really
hard to do this covers in sanitary
right here guys right here I think this
is the moment where it all went wrong
for me
sanitizing this disease just give it a
one dose of alcohol ever saw
I want my looking light you're looking a
bit dry yeah you spray okay okay I need
something cuz I I'm looking draw nothing
the little sandy right now okay we're
just gonna go in with the binder boss
Pro palette I'm just gonna use a mix
we're coming together nicely we've got a
little mouse and snatched on the outer
crease and a little amazeballs on the
lid I'm just gonna use me of luminous
Juke skin mates let's do this
Oh
yes
okay okay let me go buy some bacon I'm
telling the guys that is my full face I
did a full-blown beat in Sephora yes
security
I bought some goodies end up buying the
spray that I use at the end which is
phenomenal
I'm looking slightly greasy I went
overkill it's not my hydration but
overall we did well I had one mishap
when I applied the peridot with the
sponge if there wasn't there wasn't
happening
it wasn't working
my glam everyday Sephora yes they had
tables and also people to do their
makeup so why not
so quick update and maybe the final part
of this video is basically after I did
my makeup in Sephora they look cute and
everything but the next day my lips and
then I don't know they had an allergic
reaction or something but they blew up
I'm just gonna insert a little picture
that I was sending Harvey I was like
what the hell has happened to my lips I
don't know what it was I don't know if
it's reaction to this like alcohol I was
using to like clean my lips or if it was
something in the lipstick that I used or
if it was Adam now I don't know what it
was basically I've had I have had this
before I think I'm allergic to something
in some liquid lipsticks but I don't
know I was using testa makeup so yeah
but my lips basically exploded they were
weeping my lips felt wet what why do
mine it's all wet why their lips wet and
now they look they look burnt but the
like initial reaction has gone how to
put slobbering or lip products on as I
end up having to buy a steroid cream
steroid cream just to soothe it because
it hurt I was having to take benadryl as
well and then it's kind of just subsided
so yeah that was an eye-opener this is
going to be conclusion to this video I
mean yeah my makeup look cute but I
don't know how solitary that is me and
also you have to be really careful when
you use products I mean that's great
because I tested out the lip products
and I'm like okay I'm not gonna buy that
product because I'm gonna happen
allergic reaction to it or something I
don't know it was a weird one it looked
cute at the end of the day but now I'm a
bit like oh no I don't think I'll be
using test the makeup again no no no no
no but yeah that's it
try makeup in Sephora okay guys that is
it for me but I want to know from you

horror stories or any makeup robber

test the makeup situation let me
