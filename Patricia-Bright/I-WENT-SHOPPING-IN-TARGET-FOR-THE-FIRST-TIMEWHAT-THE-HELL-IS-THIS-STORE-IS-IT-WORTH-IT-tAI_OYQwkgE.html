just don't know how it's gonna look on
hello there beautiful people welcome
back to my channel I hope you are doing
well as you know I'm still in the US of
A honey's and I've basically been taking
advantage of some of the stores that I
see on that line all the time especially
stores that I know nothing about so
today I decided to do a kind of
supermarket sweep
tour of target now target is a store
that I know jack all about me going into
target is about to be the newest thing
I've ever done although I know it's
really popular I don't know if it's high
end or low end or cheap or affordable I
don't really know anything about it is a
makeup store it's a clothing store is it
a chicken shop is it a discount
warehouse I don't know I don't know so I
decided to go out and about and do some
shopping and Target that didn't in the
mirror guys
my kettle yeah I am being the crazy
British girl in the whole America so
today we're gonna go into target
I believe target is one of those stores
that I hear about all the time and you
know I've got a foamer what am I missing
out do I really need to be you know
enjoying and spending some money and
target maybe I do need to be so we go do
it today people we go and do it today
but there we need to target other people
is actually kind of strange to me but
you know what let's take the faith to
our destiny the nest bear right there an
escalator right there
shifting biceps already can you see them
this is a huge 20 what the hell by
buying a house
reach the food's real quickly the beauty
is the foundation reinforcement light
like natural light natural creamy
filling out creamy vanilla natural light
weight light beige medium beige nude
beige natural ways natural black sand
beige stand and town of which none of
the shoes right now so I'm gonna move on
video full face of brands I've never
heard of
what are you alright you can do that
why is now we're talking about these
brands on YouTube rap on in a mainstream
store oh this is development no this is
actually like the black hair I offer and
its massive
I'm in satin bonnet heaven if I can get
the drive to get satin bunny right here
and talking so I can try the clothing
has given me pensionable swag vibes so I
mean I might just have mystic Thyssen
beauty I'm gonna see what I can find
here but you know it's a little bit you
know exactly my style so I'll just put
it as that like I am getting the idea
significant Fupa and it's just I don't
know
Little House on the Prairie but let us
attempt to see what we can find
I kind of like this
I don't maybe this is giving me my mom
when she's like I got something very
nice high-rise jeggings did it hips and
thighs I like that
oh yes hi Rajesh what's a good pump in
these
evil we have arrived in the land of
shoes there's lots of sandals and browns
I've got the summer vibe coming on and I
actually do want a pair of shoes so I'm
gonna try and find a bit let's see three
options this to me this is no this is B
flat D Hill is not there which you know
it you can buy stuff for your bathroom
in e do you need a towel sir do you need
a toilet sir do you need a pops up she
needed gold ice cream scoops up need a
hat sir
so that's it guys that's a wrap Tyler
you were lip I was feeling that I got my
goodies here I even got some berries and
they were divine okay guys I am back
from Target and I've got some goodies
I'm gonna call it tongs J that makes it
sound a little bit more fancy honey
we've been to tarjay so be honest with
you I didn't know what to expect from
tarjay because I haven't ever been there
before and so I thought it was a
clothing and makeup store but I was 100%
wrong it's not a clothing and makeup
store it is it is
I can't really decide what it is it's
like a hybrid of everything you can get
groceries there there was a coffee shop
there was clothing there was books
electronics pots and pans and just
everything so I literally haven't
nothing to compare the store to it's
kind of like it may be a department
store but without the departments or
maybe here's the department store maybe
it is a department store however I
actually enjoyed my shopping experience
in Target let's just let's just bring
down the partners because they had wine
there was wine as well as wine and
wheelchairs all in the same place how no
there wasn't any more chairs but yeah
you know then probably was somewhere so
firstly me being a beauty go I was
astounded by the beauty collection there
was so much beauty I've again never been
in to Target and there's like you know
your classic brands like my loyal
Paris's and Maybelline's all that kind
of good stuff but there are other brands
there that I hadn't seen before
so I picked up some of those makeup
brands and I've got to say I feel like
the makeup department was stacked like
that what Rose the light was shining I
was convinced that I needed to buy a lot
of stuff there I ended up finding some
products from like Sonia Kashuk don't
know who that is
maybe I shouldn't need to I don't know I
found another brand profusion super
super affordable I was able to pick up
some middle
that has been really really wanting to
pick up as well and basically it was a
well stocked drugstore section of beauty
however let's not get into the
foundation shades that is going to be
another video maybe a lineage of full
faces brands I don't know about from
Target but yeah that was a little bit of
a struggle over there but I felt like it
was a nice beauty department not only
that we got into the hair section I'm
from England yes I'm from England and I
am black and you there's no way that
you'd go into like a hair section or
like an Asda and really find my products
I like black hair however they had that
stuff there I was shook all I needed was
to find some wee friend and a needle and
add a bend and some Bond girl had some
bonding listen we would have been ready
so that was really exciting after that I
went to them and pick up some clothing
so him or my clothing we're gonna try
and all other clothing I didn't buy that
much clothing just because I was a bit
like not so sure on it it was kind of
giving me a little bit
grandma vibes look a little bit dated no
no we did a little bit dated in there
but it was calm it was relaxed the
layout was cute and I was able to find
some gems so we're gonna try on some of
these gems and I'm gonna tell you what I
think of the goodies so first thing
we're going to go with these little
ripped denim shorts 19.99 I'm really
hoping they're gonna fit because they're
size double zero but as well like their
sizes look like they come up a little
bit larger let's just roll and see what
these look like on okay so having a look
at these these are then wow they're
really a WoW the quite I like the style
of these they are too short as you can
see I'm just getting that roll you know
when shorts are too short this is the
role that you get it's just not fitting
in the right place and I feel like I
definitely needed to size out I'm not
gonna let you guys see the back because
we have weave cheek conure coming up
we've cheek we have actual cheek moment
this was coach
weekend I could rock with this but it's
not Hotel oh right about now so these
are a nice bit of shore however they're
too small for me but the Vince to
actually like this bit and wondering
that if it was a size up that you know
whether or not we would be having cheek
coming out you know or whether or not we
just have a path I not entirely sure but
then they're not a bad short they're not
a bad short elicit my bum my bum is
actually in the shorts they are eating
the shorts eating them alive they're
being shocked right these are another
pair of shorts I thought they were nice
I thought they were cute yes I know I'm
in short season I'm in LA I'm trying to
be all you know bloom and floaty so
these like floral esque shorts can't get
these off and literally can't get these
off oh god we're stuck we're stuck oh I
love these these aren't giving me like
Little House on the Prairie but with but
with but with a little edge but with a
little bootie I really put these at you
these are actually quite a small size I
mean the sizing and target comes up kind
of large but these are actually nice I
wouldn't wear these back at home but in
a with a little espadrille you know I
would rock a little floral denim short
$19.99 don't think it's too bad and
pricing this achieved to be honest
especially right for a retail store
I like these my booties giving me slight
snatch as well what's I think this
Maggard we thank you okay tile yet so um
this little number came about because I
try to find a dress or something but
listen I I just wanted to pick up
something like dress wise just to give
you guys an honest opinion on it but
this is what I could find
I mean they tried to add a little bit of
you know sass with this little hole
right here but I just don't know how
it's gonna look on is this the trouser
is it oh it's okay okay it's a culotte
so cool up esque trouser risk jumpsuit
let's let's see what the
as icon okay okay okay so I was kind of
gonna start singing Kumbaya as I put on
this outfit like oh yeah it was given me
come by your vibes however this is so
comfortable it's actually unbelievable
it's slightly maternal it's slightly
come way up but I feel really good in it
I feel like this is like where's my
beach hat I picked up a beach hat
where's the beach hat I found from them
I found the beach hat as well but I feel
like this is just like going holiday you
know chin out and have a confession it
sounds really bad but I do spend a lot
of time sucking in take a photo you go
you know because you just want it to not
look you know no you guys know my
sensitive area is my belly because
that's where all the pies get held
however with this wonderful number I can
breathe out like I can breathe out I can
live I'm breathing it all the way out
and I feel like lunch baby's not on the
show I mean I like the way I feel in
this outfit that is what I say am i do I
feel for 2999 I don't hate I feel like
I'm a salesperson now for $29.99 you can
get yourself a maternity ed jumpsuit
whether it's a real baby on a lunch baby
this is the Johnson for you everything
just fits comfortably in the right
places and I just want to sway sway sway
on this way oh okay I wanted to try out
the denim the denim selection wasn't
giving me denim vibes that I liked it
was kind of giving me Primark denim but
you know sometimes there are some some
bad boys in there and have my stretch
and then I just wanted to find the top
as well this is just we're adding to the
combine our territory but also I felt
like because I'm in Italy I'm picking up
stuff that's got more of a vintage
flowery like chill back vibe so this is
given that or it's kind of giving me mum
tablecloth we need to see this on
foiling enough I feel like I used to
dress like this like back in the day I
feel like I need to go back to this I
feel so much at ease my belly doesn't
have to suck in I feel relaxed my abs
are like we're free I'm having to suck
in with this bad boy I'm having the
tongue or poor I feel really comfortable
just comfort clothing I like this and I
love this is give me vintage vibes that
I am really really into I mean I feel
like it's not my stuff this is the most
foul to be honest with you not anymore
but I feel cool I feel comfortable if
this is your style you can definitely
rock it secondly look at the jeans look
the jeans
they're giving me a little snatch they
even had the energy to collect in the
muffin top it's up to him it's holding
in the muffin nicely whoa okay woody
this may be clear this is low right now
I'm giving myself like Britney Spears
soaked in 1999 it says that like low
riding like small area for the booty I
don't like it I don't hate it the jeans
are actually quite a nice fit they're
actually quite cropped I like the lining
on I like the way the lines are on this
I like these jeans I really do love
these jeans I think they're baths I
think they are actually hot finally I
picked up some swim I don't never gonna
put these on we'll see we'll see what
this looks like on I don't know we're
going to need the sensor right here
people this this bikini is lifted the
girls from the shadows and bringing them
together wow it's a really a world we
really list in the gut they're lifted
and together right now I can't even show
you the bottoms cuz the bottoms will be
getting me deep monetised they are doing
Brazilian Snatcher ooh
in the crotch a roof oh yeah
I like the same I love the color this
like burnt orange Eve red yes I like I
feel very comfortable in this it's like
the girls are secure they lifted brought
together but they're secure I like this
find me on the beach somewhere darling
my boobs are lifted the girls are happy
I'm a fan I'm actually a fan that's
because then I went to the shoe
department there weren't many options in
the like really really stylish shoe
department if you just need something a
bit more casual run round shoes there's
something there these are the sandals I
picked up I've actually already been
wearing these I know they're a little
bit you know on TS but I'm telling you
that these saved me these actually saved
me during Coachella so yeah I picked up
these bad boys and they're all right
although we're starting to lose and
little bead I want to tell you that I
love these they kept me they kept me
going I put these on and snap fitted
well well these can hang but for me from
establish what did the shoe department
was at really cutting it I finally I
just tried to make my way out the store
where I picked up a hat a little hat
look at this look at this hat darling I
picked up this hat and it was giving me
actual target swag I love it I love it
who doesn't want a straw hat I don't
know for me I like this draw hat and I
say I haven't got a straw hat for the
year and this was cute I'm down with the
hat
and right now picked up some
strawberries on the way out so yeah I
was doing everything in college a
anything rule I think it's a great store
why not I would love to have a target in
the UK I feel like I'll be there a lot
and their stationery section was live
and I'm a stationery fan there's such
concessionary there so I don't know how
you define it I don't know but I like
target I'll be there again and for all
of you target shoppers enjoy I know some
of the clothing can be a little bit
dated little bit got mom but I have seen
