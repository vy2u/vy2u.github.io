shades of gray on acids bye bye bye bye
under eyes no beautiful people welcome
to my channel I hope you are doing well
yes I'm coming to you with the curls and
maybe popping I was inspired after my
little tropical getaway plus my edges
were doing kind of struggle I've you
know they're just trying to do receding
and I thought no we're gonna let my
edges live for a season so I'm gonna say
bye to the lace front wigs for a little
bit I will see we'll see how long it
lasts for today I wanted to do something
that was a bit a little bit
controversial I wanted to do a full face
train its cosmetics it cosmetics is one
of those brands that has come under fire
for its abysmal shade range and the fact
that it hasn't necessarily been a brand
that caters to the diversity of
beautiful shades of gorgeousness what
are the honest of you there foundation
only had seven shades anyway so I don't
know how they're gonna fit diversity in
only seven shades and I started to ask
myself am I expecting that every brand
is gonna be able to make forty shades
not necessarily but they're worth a
billion dollars so I still have
expectations for them to kind of do
better and they're also coming out with
a new foundation which has 12 shades and
there's 4 different categories and
there's 3 colors with in each category
and I feel like they've been really
careful to make sure that they're like
it's as equal as possible when it came
to it cosmetics the thing that really
really piqued my interest was this
concept of combining skincare and makeup
if you don't know I absolutely love
skincare though might you wouldn't be
able to tell in my face right now
because it's not feeling amazing the
brand worked with dermatologists to make
the product wage which i think is really
cool because I love seeing a dumb I love
really good skincare and it's very very
important so I'm gonna put it to a test
and we're gonna see if it's worth the
hype if I'm even Robin if they don't
even have my shade like it might even be
great and then I'm
I don't even want additional shades of
ass shows unnecessary
we'll see if you're not subscribed guys
subscribe and I'm also gonna be doing
giveaways all of this February and I've
got some goodies from fenty and I
actually have some goodies from it
cosmetic including some brushes that
also give away for this video so make
sure you subscribe interactive in the
comments interactive on my Instagram and
my Twitter but yeah let's get into this
video so I've got a lot of good news
I've got all these brushes that were
sent over they are from the PR and I'm
like they've been sending me stuff for
quite a while and I haven't given it a
look if I'll be honest and even in on my
PR unboxings I hadn't really shown that
items so though there's just a bit like
you don't even cover all shades
I'm not gonna bother showing it but you
know what I want to be a bit more
objective is it any good anyway
and I think sometimes you have to be a
little bit more open to then have a
conversation so I'm gonna go in with the
color correcting full-coverage cream
there are seven shades and there are two
shades which are dark the shade is
called deep and one of the shades is
called rich so this is the shade rich
which is the second to darkest so you
can take a little peek at that it's
actually quite yellow but in a good way
yellow unfortunately that all very thick
oh it's thick but as you can see that is
very light so that won't be working on
me I'm really hoping that the dark I can
blend into something and there we have
the dark
what I'm loving right now is the
thickness of that I love a thick
coverage foundation but but it's like it
is light but these are the darkest
shades
it contains sunscreen factor 50 is
anti-aging and it's full coverage this
is could be heaven Enochs flat top
coughing foundation brush I'm going to
use that to go in and I'm gonna go in
with the darkest shade which is deep
which isn't that dark at all
hello darkness my old friend I've come
to talk with you again have a white bead
even though it's light I have long
foundations that I like but they don't
go gray like this but they might be
lighter but they're not ashy there's
women who wear lighter foundation but it
that is 50 shades of gray on acid
hello darkness my old friend I've come
to talk with you again not like a ghost
I look like I should be in a mortuary
right now I died a year ago and I've
been frozen let it go I am one with the
wind and yeah I have got foundations
that are too light for my skin tone they
don't look like this they don't go gray
it must be a very cool base hmm where do
we go from here people where do we go
from here I thought I would look
reasonable and I look unreasonable I
look like a zombie I should be in a
zombie movie right now I just want to do
a little comparison this is the Kat Von
D lock-it Foundation I've got it in the
deep the deep warm and this shade was
too light for me but I just want to show
you what that looks like so actually if
you look at the two of them they're not
too far off right they don't actually
look too far off and that's actually it
gets rich or when I put that on it
doesn't go white you see how that's
right but this is more yellow that's
great you see the difference even though
this is lighter than me even though this
foundation is too light for my skin tone
it hasn't gone grey it's actually
brought some warmth whereas this is a
little gray it makes me wonder what does
it look like on the goals who it is
actually their shade lights look that's
too light for me this shade is too light
but it's blender ball and workable and
not great I decided I'm not going to
take it off I'm just gonna try it and
make it work just so you can actually
see what the finish results look like
and this is a thing right even if a
foundation is too light you should be
able to blend it and make it work but
that just was great so yeah oh dear
it said oh dear it's a while I feel like
I look like The Walking Dead right now
especially with these like contacts in
my eyes not gonna lie though this brush
is fantastic I really like how it looks
I really like
it's not making my makeup blend it into
my skin but I call it a shade of silver
this is literally silver it's just so
cold and trying to avoid talking about
the casket nosov the shade in terms of
the finish it's full coverage but it's
not that that full coverage I've used
more full coverage foundations we've
been able to blend it out sometimes you
have to just keep going and to see what
you get it's full coverage it feels nice
on my face I love it when makeup has
skincare in it and sunscreen is
important but I don't know I'm great
maybe it's called because of the
sunscreen I don't know if you are white
watching if you use this foundation how
does this foundation look like on you
does it give you a bit more of a white
cast on your face that would be really
interesting to know it must be the
sunscreen that makes it look more grey
like this I think that's what it is
it says physical sunscreen which is more
than likely titanium dioxide if it is
titanium dioxide yes it will make you
look white if not blue so next up I'm
going to go in with a concealer it's
called the bye-bye under-eye concealer
these are so popular I know a lot of
girls who love these and the shade that
they have are deep and warm deep the
darker shades that they have oh that is
nice and dark it's darker than the
foundation maybe it's easier for people
to make darker shades in concealer I
don't know what it is people get
concealers right a lot more than they
get foundations right that could see
those nice it's just blended in really
nicely very full coverage it's got a bit
machine in it as well I think it
contains serum why is everything not
milk coming out nice okay full coverage
this by by in the deep is actually quite
deep relatively deep but this is the
deepest and I'm sure it might not be
cheap for some so the shade I'm gonna go
with under my eyes is going to be the D
it does have a slight pinky tinge but
not bad
obviously because my face is so cold I
can't tell if this is too cold for me or
not but it's nice and creamy hmm
bye bye bye bye under eyes that's really
nice that applied really well it just
use my finger and I really like how that
came out
I do think concealer is an easier
product to do because people aren't
looking for the exact shade they almost
look looking for like an enhancement of
their shape actually what I will say is
that for an under-eye I could go a touch
lighter and I feel like it is on the
colder side for me it's definitely on
the colder side compared to my normal
concealers but it isn't bad I do like it
the way it's made my under eyes look and
if it also makes you know my under eyes
or my eyes wrinkle less then that's
great it's actually really pretty I
wonder how this is waterproof though
because it is very creamy not only do I
have dark under eyes I have dark over
eyes and I feel like the concealer
really did just lift that up really
really nicely is vibe i under eyes I'm
not my dear I'm not mad at it I think
it's okay I actually don't think it's
bad at all I see why people rave about
it the shade deep is nice and the shade
walk warm deep after that we don't have
anything yeah that could see this nice
I'm so sad that my face is so gray but
under my eyes look radiant and showed in
my eyes it really did cover my dark eyes
really nicely really really really
nicely I really like that but I'm gonna
go ahead and do my eyes and get back to
you I'm going to go in with the siharan
palette from Julia's place I have
invested into some black-owned brands
and this one's really popular not going
to like it but I'm really excited and
I've been using it a lot and loving it
I'm gonna go in with Jim Miller right
here I actually feel like the casinos
making the eyeshadow pop even more which
is right because I don't really do a
shadow that pops a lot what I'm wishing
is this brush was a bit more fluffy it's
not giving me enough fluffiness am I
gonna go in with the superhero mascara
also from it cosmetics see if it makes a
little difference not bad not bad
it's giving me a little lift it's giving
me a little separation see if we can get
some coverage on my bottom lashes it's
not bad but it's taking work I'm not
getting loads and loads obviously I'm
comparing this to the benefit bad girl
bang mascara which is kind of epic but
this has given me really nice lift and
extension not actually that much volume
but lift and extension and I'm not gonna
lie it's kind of workable you know but
I'm Scott is actually quite nice right
let me get several lashes on and then
I'm just gonna try and tie the whole
face in together okay
lashes and eyes done I'm gonna set my
under eyes there isn't a peril doll that
I can use so I'm just gonna go back in
with my favorite matte patrick star and
sort of got all this brush is kind of
fancy it's got this little I don't know
it's call it like teardrop in the middle
I don't know what that is but it's cute
I want to see if that will work on
demands I'm not sure though it's a
little bit flippy that's good enough I
will say the concealers not very matte
not very much at all but of course the
power of settings means that you should
be good up so you don't wanna do is get
in your hair
oh my go see a this has been my go-to
powder the combination if you don't know
that of that Patrick Starr and some
Wilder from glossier hopefully it will
warm up the gray the grayness that we
have going on
actually different the gosset could do
that actually help books is just I mean
it's tying together I feel like it isn't
my most beautiful like I don't feel like
my most amazing with this look the
concealer isn't bad but again it's still
on the colder side I just looked quite
great not too far from my skintone but I
prefer to look a lot more radiant and
warm and rich rich in color rich in life
but I look a little bit you know I look
a bit broke right now you know I'm broke
because there's no richness coming
through it but it isn't bad it isn't
awful definitely that concealer has
really just made my under eyes look
really nice it really did help with the
dark circles it's a nice consistency and
again I'm about that's all skin care
element I'm gonna go and move this this
is the your your most beautiful matte
bronzer radiant illuminizer
and brightening brush palette not bad
but I feel like I can automatically tail
it's just going to just sneer cast get
ready me let's just see I'm not doing is
getting much of anything that's me
attention to use the bronzer up you guys
see that not much is happening you know
I think on someone lighter maybe it
would be more visible but on me it's
literally invisible anything happening
we're getting some bonding but again
it's more like a grey runs in on me I'm
just gonna stop there let's try this
brush brush is pretty actually a nice
blush it's kind of got an iridescent
glow to it not for me though not for my
skin tone yeah no it's a note so Wow but
the highlight over is it bad at all it
is a bit more on the white side but it
isn't bad again I feel like that would
look so nice on someone of a lighter
skin tone that looks actually quite nice
of me by the way this is my favorite
cheek bone I always show you guys that
cheek bone this for me isn't great but
the bronzer just didn't even show
I think it was doing some secret bronze
in like it was slightly invisible on me
and then the blast little bit washed out
the highlight wasn't bad at all it's
given me a slight glisten
okay guys that is my full face of it
Cosmetics for some reason I feel like I
look slightly Caucasian I know that
sounds really weird I know it sounds
really weird but I don't think you can
slightly get one say you can't explain
it I'm just giving myself a slight
Caucasian vice
maybe it's the colors that I've gone for
it's very just grey like the only thing
that is really bringing color to this
look is basically the fact that I've got
orange on my eyes I feel like that has
compensated for the grey nurse that
bye-bye under-eye concealer
yes I am down hooray the foundation as I
say it's not just because it's not my
shade it also just went quite grey and I
think it's because of the sunscreen
inside the foundation so I'm wondering
how nice the new foundation is gonna be
whether or not I think I would test it
yeah but this seems like there's a
little bit more going on yeah I would
try yeah again I love that idea that
there is skincare and dermatology have
helped create this brand I love that and
that's why I would try it yes do I think
that they should have more shades for
sure but they've only got seven shades
in this foundation anyway so I mean my
expectations aren't so high and then
this new ones got 12 maybe they'll have
more soon but overall it's not going to
be the brand that I'm gonna go to for
like many cons let's just be honest it's
not going to be a brand that I I'm gonna
be spending a lot at that concealer I
would buy 100% the rest of it meh okay
guys I think that is me done cannot
follow me won't Instagram and my twin I
must not chat make sure you do as I said
I am gonna be doing giveaways for
February cuz it's the season of love and
it's actually my birthday month as well
so yeah make sure you interactive leave
comments a DM you guys and I've got so
much to give you guys so thanks for
watching guys and I'll catch you later
