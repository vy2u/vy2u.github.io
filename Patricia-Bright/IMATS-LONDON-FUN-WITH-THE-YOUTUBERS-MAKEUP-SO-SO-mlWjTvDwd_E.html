like mind o'clock in the morning right

weekends but you know all for the lovely
makeup it should be working and we're
gonna show you along the days and I'll
be meeting I'll be maintaining surely as
well so it should be good fun today so
I'll take you guys along so we've just
reached Alexandra Palace
I'm here with Shirley Shirley to say hi
there's a lot of people here
who here more for me like later on
memorized it
did you get jelly
are they quite pigmented
don't say that
okay Thank You Shelly
Oh
it was a good time I wouldn't say it was
what would you say
I will say that this is my stuff have
you got to meet a lot of
the Western products there they were not
much that much discount it was great
seeing it
so now we're going to go to
I really want to see
decided to go shopping didn't we
beautiful conversation this conversation
yeah so that it's a boy but you see what
you're going to do tonight
hi guys welcome to my channel so today's
video is actually gonna be a review on
that I'm at this weekend at IMATS event
and I attended on the Saturday and I
have such an amazing day I met up with
Shirley I did message a message term we
kind of organized to go down together I
went down there together on the way we
met this beautiful beautiful girl called
Kay who actually was going by herself
and she's come all the way down from
Cardiff it's kind of for Wells I don't
know it might be in Scotland but yeah
she's from Cardiff and um like we met
her while she was but I have faces
flawlessly could tell she was a makeup
artist actually studying her MBA so she
was really nice we all went down there
together I got in the queue everything
and it was just you know really cool we
started taking pictures off straight off
the bat posing I'm gonna have all the
video footage and little clips that I
took throughout the day in pictures um
in at the end of the video also we then
met up with Sami Beauty crush and Danni
her sister who also has a channel on
YouTube and so it was kind of like all
of us all together and it was just a
really good event and we met so many
other youtubers so many others
subscribers it was so fun everyone who
came up to me honey and yeah like every
was so nice and normal
not weirdest so that was really cool and
everyone was just so fun so in terms of
the makeup stands over there for some
reason we didn't see my ex clearly
because we were too busy talking among
ourselves surely we missed NYX okay it
was there and then we missed it but you
know the illamasqua stand was great the
sleek stand was good the Mac stand was
good although I felt like they didn't
even have like the
new collection the new stuff I've seen
recently and there's no discount unless
you had the pro card so it was kind of
like going into a Mack concession so you
earned it for that you're really getting
everything all the goodies but you know
it was nice and as loads of people with
dramatic makeup on I've got footage of
that and like loads of models everywhere
being painted can wonderful you know you
could get a good range of things there's
a lot of people setting brushes so
there's a lot of brushes that you could
get from low price to higher price so
Kabuki brush for 100 rat pounds
whether it was pure Gardner Japanese
gorgeous gorgeous
what else that was there was so many
things let me think
yeah so the illamasqua stand was the
best to me they had the crown was there
actually crown brushes and the palettes
what the pallets are really expensive
and I thinks one day was telling me that
you could get this somewhere somewhere
else so um yeah Karma's gonna Illamasqua
they had brushes full brushes
for 25 pounds was like the biggest
bragging ever however by the time I got
there sold out the eyeshadow palette
that one it sold out all gone and they
weren't getting him back for the Sundays
I was really upset about that and that
was it really
I didn't actually buy that much I bought
some stuff from the the sleekest and I
did notice that a lot of us didn't
really buy that much stuff we spent more
time joking and laughing with each other
and just meeting up other youtubers who
were there taking pictures filming where
else were the subbies he came up to me
and they're really nice for the comment
be name but you're doing studying being
a barrister at BP Law School so yeah she
was really cool I've got footage of her
other gods hypose their pose myth Park
yeah what a pity that was so much fun
sitting afterwards and me sure
a Danny Sammy and one day and the girl
who we met at the bus stop we all went
down to London Oxford Circus
we went down to chow chow moon it's a
really nice kind of noodle bar
restaurant thing that is just really
close we all ate lunch there there for
ages just talking at all here and
laughing it was great fun then I went
off shedding the goal of the thing when
talk to suckers and to Mac and continued
shopping which they shouldn't have done
no more shopping and then afters we
actually mean Shirley and one day
actually ended up going out to a house
party and then to a club which you've
got some pictures of as well although
this is not Facebook so I'm not going to
put everything up but yeah all in all it
was a great day and what made it great
to me was just meeting everyone if I was
so lovely like so fun everyone has such
great personalities and stuff and it's
so great to kind of meet everyone and
you know see what they're like in person
and the funny thing is that everyone is
almost just what they're like on YouTube
like the same so yeah it was great fun
so I'll put pictures off and footage of
the day um after this and picture so
yeah it was great I'll definitely do it
again next year and if anything actually
makes me want to organize a meet up cuz
I said it's more about the people to me
and yes you think the meetup would be a
good idea
leave a comment maybe you know Shirley's
a me one day and you have other
youtubers who we met would like to
organize that and maybe we can just get
a clip you know written it out I just
all me each other meeting me
