look I mean just this time so today's
video is actually going to be on my new
home register if it's really bright
because the song is shining a lot and
stuff but I'm pacing my name color I'm a
bit of a redhead right now or Albarn so
I think this myself this is my new hair
extensions it's spring and everything's
right for you know what then we switch
it up let me get some power so we bounce
and this is like natural textured hair
this is ready hair I will give you all
the details on this hair in another
video because I have got some mix to
banish about hair very soon
but um yeah this is a natural texture
all I do is at night when I just wet it
and I swirl it and then I just undo the
tourists morning to give me I might
don't you to pull on it if you want let
me know if you want so anyway the hair
was came in a natural grab this natural
black that kind of natural black and
then I lifted it I used um peroxide
developer to lift it to this beautiful
urban color and
highlights so what do you guys think
they suit me I don't know I love it I
love the volume I love the texture I
think this is really perfect definitely
going away this year so this is gonna be
like my holiday hair even maybe
something kind of what let me show it to
you from the back it's so soft it's so
bouncy I hope it's really not really
really bright yeah that's my new fly
away
it's not dry it's very voluptuous and
fresh looking and just gorgeous and like
I can't I can't boast another bite I
know it's quite annoying but yeah I love
you know this collar on me because I
think I always wear natural black we're
always so that you know like on is that
necessarily suit my skin color I think
that in moderation and the right color
and it can probably suit Gazza dark skin
so I'm quite dark skin so I would never
go for like really like this so let me
know what you think I have it I'm gonna
have a video tutorial getting these
cards and kind of getting this style I
also have it
talking about hair actually wanna burst
some myths about hazards I've been
contacted by companies who want to only
sell merch and busily inhale like
boilers sorry
anything that rubbish Azuri Brazilian
women do not cut there fact that you can
not fact about I know that they're not
game and you thought Brazilian air but
I'm gonna draw the video well if I'm
gonna do a video after this video about
that so um yeah but this is what you
know this is Virgin thinking okay and
it's different for me because of the
what's it called the texture so usually
quite straight
I wonder what's gonna be like when I
work for Lincoln to work on a Monday oh
and it's not like really no it's you
know like you know naturally that you
know my day and I'm on the beach come
out of the water
her okay sorry I'm like overdoing this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
