video is going to be a makeup review and
it's going to be on a foundation review
and an inexpensive alternative to Mac
and that is actually the sleek revive
foundation so I'll show you that here
this is a sleek new revive silicone
based foundation and anyone who wants to
know I'm a color nutmeg which i think is
number nine eight eight now I got this
in January I think maybe it was like
after January at a sleek event and they
did there were lots of free products and
stuff and I got this and I was like not
really sure that I'm gonna use sweet
foundation because I'm not really a
foundation where in general and I found
that my Mac Foundation which is the
studio fix fluid in the NW 45 I found
that it it like discolored and I'd look
nice the second I threatened and afters
I just looked like some gray tree trunk
or something there's no other words to
describe it it just looked off key as I
just like you can see this is literally
full I just don't use it at all and then
you know I was like okay fine and I'll
try this out and then I love this like I
love the color and when we got it and
they had this thing where they like
lined up girls from every single color
spectrum you could find from the whitest
of the white to the darkest of the dark
and everything in between and they were
literally like go stand by the girl that
you think color suits you that all
matches you the most and I did that and
she told me what color she was wearing
and I love it um it really does it
doesn't discolor so I'm wearing it now
it really does stay like this for up the
whole day now you guys have seen the way
I apply foundation I kind of just apply
it onto my darker areas and then kind of
blend it all in and it blends perfectly
with my skin and it's um if your skin is
quite dry then it is quite thick also
and it does give you a smoother
appearance and I believe that's probably
because of it being silicone base but if
you are sensitive to silicone
anything like that maybe you want to
avoid this but so far and I've been
using this for months I really really
like it
and for those of you really don't want
to spend a lot of money on foundation
this is a great alternative and if you
are a little bit oily or you don't wear
foundation that much you can make I use
the Mac powder the studio fix powder in
the NW 45 so I like dot and I never I
was never a powder fan before because I
thought it made me look ashy but when I
have that along with some powder on the
top my god I'm lonely I am glowing but
yeah just for anyone who's looking for a
great alternative sleeps got a lot of
good product I think and the fact
they're so affordable and their range is
so big it's a great alternative I have
loads of things from sneek like ten
pallets I've got an a massive like
makeup kit I could show you if you would
like to see that and that's got all
their different brushes and if you would
like to see a review on those products
then go ahead and leave a comment and I
will do that but yet the sleek revive I
think it can't be more than ten pounds
okay versus this which i think is 23
pounds this is like half the price and
and it doesn't discolor Neal it's
perfect on me but that's just my opinion
so yeah if anyone's looking for
something else then I think this is a
great alternative so guys thanks for
watching I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
