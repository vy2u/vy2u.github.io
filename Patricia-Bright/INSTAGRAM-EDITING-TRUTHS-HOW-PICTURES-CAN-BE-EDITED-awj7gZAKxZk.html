little bit look like before looks like
after guys so today I've gone to
Instagram a hacks video for you and I
wanted to do an Instagram hacks that's a
little bit different because I feel like
people just show you their like the
gentle editing you know they just made
the photo a little bit brighter a little
bit more saturated but people will not
show you how they snatch your waist
so that's your facing you know smooth it
all out make it like extra glowy and
stuff like that and sometimes you do see
photos and you're like how does your
photo look like that why is it that when
I try to do it I'm not able to do it and
I feel like you just kind of need to
know exactly how and what people are
using because people are genuinely using
iPhones but they are also using other
cameras and other bits of software so
today I want to show you how to really
get that Instagram glow waist matched
and that you know amazing look going on
and I'm sure lots of people I think this
can be slightly controversial because
people don't necessarily want to fess up
to like editing photos but lots of us
definitely do it and it's all about
doing it in subtlety and kind of
enhancing what you might already have or
sometimes what the camera takes away
because sometimes I'm like I take F of
myself I'm not I look ten times better
than that in real life so why is the
camera not picking it up so that's
usually the case that I do it so first
thing I want to show you are the tools
that I use and I use at my iPhone and I
use my sony a5100 light ake photos also
have a Samsung phone that I also use
here and there as well for photos but
these are the main things I do for my
photos on Instagram now I will say that
there's pros and cons to each so number
one this picks up really high quality
it's got skin smoothing effect on it and
I think it just gives you that kind of
glamorous glow and it's really detailed
but I genuinely feel like this camera
distorts your face like it makes your
face look a little bit you know wider a
little bit I don't know a bit more fish
eye so it comes out in the middle more
but
this is a wider lens whereas I feel like
the iPhone camera is way more true to
life to what your face actually looks
like and say for instance I don't have
to change the shape of my face when I
use my iPhone but when I use this I have
to kind of put my face back to normal
because it kind of looks a bit alien ish
in my opinion and I have noticed that
people say you look a bit different and
it's only when I use this camera that it
looks different and I do use the front
camera for selfies it's not that good
but on the 6s it's excellent let's
firstly talk about editing apps and how
they how they work there are basically
about three apps that I use for any one
photo I wouldn't say I do this all the
time and I wouldn't say that if you're
on every day girl that you need to do
this but if you want to be fly and if
you want to be like really I don't know
if you want to make it a bit more than
just you know a dry Instagram feed then
I think you do have to make some more
effort into it so I use about three
different apps and the apps that I use
are number one facetune number two I use
off the light and number three I use VSO
times I'm going to go ahead and edit
this image here this image was taken on
my iPhone in front of a window I don't
usually use lights when it comes to
taking it but lots of people do and I
basically have a few simple steps that I
always do when it comes to editing in
selfie so the first step I always do
it's got these steps here the first
thing I always do is I whiten and I
always whiten my background I don't know
why but I think it just makes everything
in the image pop and all you do is
basically press whiten and that's it and
already you'll notice that when you
whiten the background it makes
everything else pop out and it's okay if
you go over black it doesn't seem to
change the color black but it can change
the color of other things so that's what
it looked like before that's what you
look like after and then the next step I
do is I smooth my skin and this is
probably just - I don't know get rid of
any blemishes but it kind of gives you
that kind of Instagram halo and mostly
everyone does this I think you just need
to do it in moderation
and is why I've got like dimples but if
the dimples not show me it kind of just
looks weird so I just smooth it out
unless it's like a proper dimple and I
usually just do my forehead around my
cheek area my fake dimple that didn't
quite dimple up properly definitely
under my eyes so sometimes this is where
you get some creasing and on the tip of
my nose as well but I kind of like to
leave the tip because there's a nice
highlight on it and if you smooth it you
get rid of the highlight so this is the
before that's what it looks like that's
the difference the next thing I like to
do which makes your eyes pop is I
actually whiten the whites of my eyes
again it depends on what night I'm in
sometimes it needs it sometimes it
doesn't but just simply just doing a
little bit of white it makes the white
of my makeup pop more and it makes my
pupils pop more as well so let's look at
the difference and I've kind of done an
extreme version so that ahem so that you
guys can really see what it looks like
but that's the before and the after of
the I whitening is I'm not going to like
it's very subtle and then I'll go ahead
and use the tool here called details and
then what I do is I would carefully
swipe on top of my lips because if you
do too much it can look a bit crazy and
I think that looks a bit much so I'm
just gonna go details and just touch it
and it kind of makes your lipstick pop
do it on the brows get those brows
popping do it on the eyes get those eyes
popping the difference is very subtle
because you can't see it but it does
make a difference here and I could do it
a bit more extreme so you can see but
there you go that's what that looks like
so the one thing I do is sometimes I do
reshape and usually do on the Sony
camera because this camera basically
distorts your face but on the iPhone
camera not so much but what I do I
always like to basically make my neck
look longer and bring my shoulders down
I don't know why I think it looks more
attractive but you simply just do that
you can also bring your chin and
everything in a bit more so that's the
difference between shoulders up and
shoulders down now this lighting is very
light because I took it in front of a
window
so what I like to do is then save that
down when I've done everything that
makes the image look you know beautiful
and quite beautiful I will then add all
the color in everything so I go ahead
and open this up and I in off the light
as well and for me what it is is that
this image is far too like bright and
needs to be kind of made a bit darker
and added a bit more color so what I do
is I would drop down the brightness to
make it a little bit more rich a bit
more true to my skin tone and then I
will increase my contrast as well and
that makes that pot and that's basically
it in this so you can see this is what
it looked like before so it looks like
after before after when I'm done with
that I save that to my camera roll and
then I edit it for the third and final
time in VSO cam and I would then add a
filter that I like that I feel
represents my Instagram feed so there's
so many different filters that you can
use and I really like the ones like this
that are d saturated this is a really
popular colorful one this is like it's
got soft hue over it that's kind of
green one but I usually go for a four or
a five and then what you can do is you
can dictate how much of it it basically
does it so yeah so when it comes to
taking photos of here the first thing is
I do I will pick the photo from my
camera and then I transfer that via
Wi-Fi to my iPhone and then once it's in
my iPhone I go through the same steps
but I would normally go through so when
they get onto my iPhone the tool I use
is play memo and so I can view all the
images that I've transferred from my
phone from there to here so let's go
ahead and edit this photo if anything do
I
there isn't really very much that I
change so I would do the thing I
normally do which is to whiten the
background white and everything maybe
I'd whiten my top as well because it
kind of looks like an off-white but this
did it really doesn't need that much
editing if I be completely honest with
you and then I walk smooth what you can
see is that my pores are more visible so
I can smooth this but again I don't like
overdoing it because you kind of end up
using some of the the nice shine and
I'll show you might see that I've got
some creasing here as well so I can
smooth that at up to that's the before
the after and I will whiten my eyes so
you can see that you can kind of see you
know my eyes are not that white there it
makes your eyes just pop out as well if
that isn't the eye a beautiful thing
then I can go ahead I might just move a
touch just because I'm used to smoothing
and there we go and I will still always
add that detail so I want my lips to pop
and I want my brows and my eyelashes to
pop pop I am and you see a slight
difference yeah there's a difference you
can see that you can also add more
contours so I'm just going to do I
wouldn't normally do this on this photo
but I want to show you how you can pick
a tone so I can see my darker color here
and I can pick this color and I can
splash a touch more contour one like
that exactly the same where I do it with
makeup just adding a little bit more of
a darker color that's a little bit
extreme maybe going to lie so you can
just basically erase it as well that's
pretty nice ed if I am going to change
the shape I always bring up my shoulders
down and make my neck look longer and I
never use a reshape because that looks
kind of crazy if you use refine that
looks a lot different so right here my
shoulder seam little high and this is
before and this is after and I think
this is the one step that what so you
can do but if you look you can actually
see that my it has kind of distorted the
top I was wearing and so I can erase
that if I want to by using the patch
tool but do you know what I don't really
care it's not that deep don't you love
it so this is the photo now and this is
it this was it before but I'm going to
change the color so I think this looks a
bit too yellow I'm not going to change
it in off the light I'm going to just
change it in via so cam so I'm going to
show you what I would do I would
basically change the temperature and
I'll make it less yellow which means I'm
making it colder
you can go blue you can go orange so
I'll make it like just two steps cooler
I would add more contrast contrast
basically makes your dark a bit darker
in your light a bit lighter and then I
could also saturate a little bit that's
a little bit much but yeah
then I can go ahead and add one of these
filters if I wanted to again a five is
literally like my favorite but I might
drop it down make it like that that's
two photos edited you can see the
quality of the Sony camera versus the
iPhone front camera and now I'm going to
finally show you how you can edit the
body and this is the secret that lots of
people don't want to show so yes I'm
sure lots of you think probably nothing
needs to be done to this but I'm about
to show you what a lot of people do
which is basically it's match the waist
and make things look a little bit more
tight a little bit more refined and
which is okay but totally unnecessary
lots of the time I'm going to just focus
on my waist area and I'm certainly going
to use the reshape tool again refine and
what you have to do is you have to come
in really close to avoid looking crazy
I'm just going to basically snatch my
waist in a touch just a touch that was
quite extreme that but I can do that
without distorting anything else you
really have to be careful because if
your background is not playing you can
actually end up looking crazy and
distorting loads of things and then this
side my arms really close so the reality
is that you can't I don't want to change
too much because my arm is going to go
weird but what I can do is just bring in
some of the stripes and that looks like
from that to that and then this is my
kind of side hip dent place can bring
that dent out which is a dent I've
always had I don't mind it there it
looks like I've got enough I take a body
when I really don't check this out hello
hello hello so it's so interesting to
see I know loads of people do this I
don't personally normally edit this what
I wanted to kind of show you what can be
done I think this looks a little bit
ridiculous and people can narrow their
thighs if they wanted to so sometimes
you see those fight and actually know
how you do a thigh gap because the
thighs are out both going to change what
you can see how it might be possible
normal to Instagram and then another
thing you can do I personally prefer to
play with shade and
right because it's much more natural you
can smooth down the legs and then where
I've got shadow I can pick the shadow by
just picking it and what if you wanted
to looks a slimmer you can just use
shadow is similar to contouring and it
looks a little bit more toned again you
want to avoid looking dirty that makes
anything so Instagram versus real life
again I have been very subtle with the
activity they're totally people who take
this completely and utterly overboard
and you probably want to decide if
that's something you want to do I think
you can do the same of boobs I think you
can I don't really ever do that but
might look check out those boobs boobs
they've got a bit crazy hold on what
we're doing while we're doing yeah I
don't know how you do the boobs I don't
if you do that let's see if you could
get you can make the bit of slightly bit
bigger oh yeah you can guys check that
out and then obviously I think another
way would be to again the shading let's
shade those now they look they look
dirty nearly like dirty boobs okay I'm
not really a boob shaping expert for
those of you who just like to take
beautiful landscapes as well I'd say
that off the light and VSO cam are all
you need I took this photo a really
gorgeous location and I knew that those
ways to just make this look you know a
little bit more fleek and then this is
where I basically clarify clarifying
basically kind of brings more light to
the center and adds more contrast I'm
going to clarify I am going to brighten
a touch I'm going to add more contrast
and I'm going to saturate the before the
after the before the after and it's
simple it's simple playing with light
then with the vsam I'll go ahead and use
the colors that I feel match my theme
and my vibe so you guys know I love a
five and I love a six click desaturate
but i can you see one make it look
bright and f to make it look cool which
i think that looks really nice so I'm
going to go ahead and save that so guys
those are some of my is to grab hacks
that I hope you find you
four and again don't overdo it let's not
go crazy but genuinely sometimes you
might be looking at some instagrams and
some people I'm thinking how do they
look so perfect in your you know going
crazy about yourself looking awful and
not realizing that there's probably a
lot of facetune reshaping colorizing
contour and lighting going on so if you
want to look just as good in pictures as
they do then you just probably need to
implement some of these tools but
remember Instagram and real life are two
different things okay so guys thanks for
watching and I will catch you later
anything else you want me to do please
let me know and I'll get that done for
you you know it's nice to have some big
old pillows in the same breath you know
you don't let anyone touch dead because
you're like no babe no away from the
boob</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
