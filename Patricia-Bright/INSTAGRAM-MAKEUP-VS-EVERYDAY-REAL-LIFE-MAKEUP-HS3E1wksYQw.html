ridiculous like this but so cool at the
same time today I wanted to do Instagram
makeup versus natural and kind of like
more than everyday makeup look and to me
this is so much fun because I absolutely
largest planet makeup tonight transform
myself I'm to be honest I feel like I
can be Beauford these people like I have
this day wear butter wouldn't melt go
next door I'm so sweet and innocent and
some days I'm this bitch over here it
was like my felt like that dramatic side
once in a whirl with the glamour even
added the contact Michael hates contact
something he hates them he says I look
like a reptile but do you know what he
doesn't understand the way that contacts
can make your eyeshadow pot like
differently I was inspired by Laura
Lee's video she did an Instagram makeup
versus normal makeup only kicked down
below and I just thought it was a really
nice concept actually ended up changing
this contact throughout the video
because I only put this one on at the
very end but I've even done like the
faux freckles as well like Who am I who
is this person
anyway guys I really hope you enjoyed
this video I had fun like making this
because I just played with some extra
colors that I wouldn't normally do I've
used some Instagram favorites some new
products as well you guys let me know
what side you prefer Oh name me name
what should my name be here like I need
a special name and then what's my name
I feel like this side is basically
Virgin Mary like this is Virgin Mary and
this side here is like yes like what we
call this side I don't know let's just
call this side something so guys I
really hope you enjoyed this video if
you're not already subscribed make sure
you subscribe if this video thumbs up
you can also click the notification post
so let me know when I upload videos so
guys thank you for watching and I'll see
you later so I'm starting off with my
brows which are just so drum
take someone said this in my last video
that I do say watching my breath and I'm
not gonna lie that my eyebrows are my
personality they're just very
opinionated like I don't have to say
anything but these bad boys they do all
the talking for me and I don't have my
eyebrows a kind of struggle but you know
I know whether this is going to sort it
out and using the Tom Ford brow
sculpting kit which I really do like and
normally I just draw a line on the
bottom and you know for Instagram you're
going to bring it all the way out like
kind of needs to come close to your neck
and then I do a line across the top as
well and I kind of square it and I'm
just going to kind of create some false
heads around here because my eyebrows
are really far apart and I'm going to
use this pixie brow tamer this actually
came in my look fantastic
January beauty box I get a beauty box
from look fantastic every month and I
saw this in them I was like yes I'm just
going to use this to get all my strays
to go down good luck it just gives my
eyebrows just a little bit a gloss like
glassy down next I'm going to go with
the LA girl Pro which of course is an
Instagram favorite and I always feel
like this concealer is so it's just so
thick but I think that's why people like
it I'm just going to use this brush from
Tom Ford to conceal all around and I'm
going to go harsh we're going to go all
the way harsh people it's going to cut
like a knife
then I'm going to take that concealer
all the way down and around my eyes and
use it as a base for my eyeshadows now
with the same concealer I'm going to go
in with a damp Beauty Blender under my
eye by it's just globe in now
now obviously it looks a lot brighter
than my skin tone but by the time it I'd
like my foundation that everything just
got that glamorous glow going on now for
my Mac foundation I'm gonna go with my
Lancome ten miracle I love love love the
Lancome foundation and this foundation
is just oh my gosh it's like a
moisturizer I love the color I just love
the way it feels on it feels like a
treatment can I feel like I only need
like two pumps when I say Instagram
makeup I feel like it's really nowadays
like everyday makeup like life life is a
runway girl life is a runway and then
what I feel is that my eyebrows just
need a little bit more of a feather into
that foundation hold on hold on I hope
those eyebrows are not too close the
good thing is that a little bit of
concealer can always sort that out
so normally I'd set with some Sasha and
while I do my eye makeup and I kind of
bring it closer to my nose because that
actually helps to make the nose look a
little bit more snatched so next I'm
going in with the Tartus Pro palette I
feel like this is definitely an
Instagram favor but I'm a huge huge fan
of tar I do feel like the kind of payoff
is excellent and I'm going in with this
orange color called whimsy here orange
is my favorite as a kind of bridge color
and then I'm going to go in with smoked
just to add some color on the outside
almost like a cut crease that really for
Instagram makeup I should kind of be
kind
really should know I'm just going to
blend the two of those together I'm
going to go with something really bright
on the lid and this color is called
broad and I'm going in with Matt's but
I'm going to add a bit of shimmer a bit
later on and then I'm going to go in
with a cereal I'm not going to like I
always love the gold of my inner
tear-duct going in at with the Instagram
favorite which is the cat from the
tattoo liner it's not gasps this liner
is amazing and I'm not gonna lie I'm not
great with my lining my eyes but this I
feel like just gives my winged eye just
that just that extra bit of Shakey's
like you know as I said that and then as
soon as I try and fit I'm just gonna
mess it all up
hopefully it off I'm gonna go in and I'm
gonna use at my black eyeliner just to
make everything pop up but I don't
normally wear eyeliner ah did makeup
with a contact info so weird I'm just
gonna wipe someone with such a ah for
the my mascara I'm gonna go in with the
Mac false eyelash this mascara alright
it's not a favor of mine but it's good
for volume ization but and then I'm
gonna go in with my favorites which are
the huda beauty lashes and the lash I'm
wearing is the Samantha the Samantha is
oh so drama but I've been wearing it and
I've been really really liking it and
then I'm actually gonna just add a
little bit more mascara on my lashes on
the bottom I barely have any lashes
they're not even gonna lie like there's
not much going on but you know I can
kind of clump them together and create
an illusion now what I haven't done is
any highlight or any contour or anything
so I'm going to go in with my bare
minerals bare Pro this color is kokoa
a really nice dog I normally contour
just for my eyebrows down and I'm using
the Kat Von D shade + light brush to
contour this is a really nice angle
brush good
and for highlight I am using the Pat
McGrath fine gold pigment I love love
love love love this as a highlighter but
look at the color of that this to me
like from how it looks here to how it
looks on skin it translates so well like
this is a favorite and then I'm just
going to use a fever as my blush from
Mac just having a bit more highlight and
I am a highlighted contoured now for my
lips so this is new this came in
yesterday from Anastasia Beverly Hills
so I'm just gonna create something for
my lips and 99.9% of the time I wear
nude lips I don't really do kind of
bright colors but you know what for the
gram
I'll do it so I'm just going to line my
lips with my favorites all my favorite
lip liners are basically for Mac I'm
using night moth because this is a
really strong and dark purple I'm
actually going to go in with this bright
purple here but I'm going to kind of
combine it with a couple of others that
purple bags yes
whoa look all kinds of drama like yes
yes mmm all right so I'm gonna go and
move onto this side here and for my
brows I am using the same product but I
will say that when I do my brows i
could' everyday basis I wouldn't put as
much like brow product I'm gonna go in
with my L'Oreal True Match this is my
favorite drugstore foundation they have
got such a big color age the color I'm
wearing is 10 D you guys know I am a
lawyer ambassador I'm just going to use
this all over and then for my concealer
and going in with my bare minerals bare
skin I love love love this concealer I
just tap a bit under my eyes but this
eye looks really big and this I just
looks really small like what is that
normally I still wear eye shadow on an
everyday basis and actually I love me my
Matt's like my mats are lovely I love
this palette from Kat Von D it's on my
favorite so I normally go with this
color here just on my lid just like a
little wash just to prevent the oiliness
I have oily eyelids it's so annoying
Brown for my mascara I'm going to use
the bare minerals lash domination
eyewear use a lot of them and all I
really do like bare minerals go bare
minerals this is a really good mascara
for everyday I feel like it definitely
like lengthens my lashes and just coats
them nicely and then I still use my Mac
fever on a daily basis I just don't put
as much on to - I feel like all the
colors and everything can be used on an
everyday basis but it's all about the
application what my favorite liners is
also bittersweet from that it's so nice
it's really nice natural but warm Brown
I want to go with an understated gloss
guys that look not like it looks mad and
the funny thing is that like both sides
in that own way like this I feel really
pretty really like young and just cute
and everything and on this side I just
feel like oh my gosh but I love it I
love it and that's a great thing about
makeup is that you could kind of you
know create different looks but still be
who you are and just represent a little
bit of fun and make copies for fun and I
kind love it it makes me happy yeah love
it and so guys that is that my Instagram
makeup versus like normal natural
everyday makeup so guys thank you so
