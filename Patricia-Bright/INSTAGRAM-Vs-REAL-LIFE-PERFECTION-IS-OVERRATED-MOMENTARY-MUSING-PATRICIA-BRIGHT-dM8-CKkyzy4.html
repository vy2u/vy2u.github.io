i have a momentary musing where i share
my thoughts and my opinions on just
things that i don't know I've been
thinking that recently recently I've
been thinking about the concept of
perfection and why it's completely and
utterly overrated especially because so
many of us are looking at Instagram like
its goals and it's the real life and you
never know what the actual
behind-the-scenes is to get to where an
image or montage has come from that you
just never know and that shows inspired
because there's a video that's just gone
viral which is called Instagram husbands
and it was hilarious I'm going to link
it down below you have to see it was so
funny because I completely and utterly
related to it you know doing everything
to get a perfect photo pausing on eating
and you guys know I love my food I was
telling my partner to do I like when I
want it higher one here and getting a
perfect photo the reality is that
perfection is overrated and you never
know what it takes to get so couple
goals I see this everywhere like hashtag
goals
his-and-hers can I be like them and I
just stick to myself
you never know what is going on behind
closed doors and just because two people
are taking photos together doesn't mean
that they're happy awesome if they've
got loads of time to take perfectly
edited photos on a regular basis to show
the world how happy they are probably
means they're not spending enough time
doing other things together the reality
is that actually taking photos I don't
know is like for other people out there
but to people taking photos together you
know one person I might be all twisted
and other person's it might be dry never
know what it's like and your there's a
struggle when it comes to taking photos
I don't like taking photos with my
partner booking this like them it gets a
very stressful at the end of it and like
go away babe like seriously and this is
the truth of the matter avoid looking at
other people's relationship as gold
because you don't know what's going on
behind closed doors or in the bedroom
saying where I've seen couples who are
all probably per ad or mainly on the
girls I apparently per ad but that guy
is also seeing another girl who he
hasn't claimed on his social media when
you see couples who looks like they
bought each other gifts and like bay the
bay bought me this before couples have
to keep affirming each other with things
potentially it's a sign of he might have
done something wrong actually and he's
got to be like I'm sorry darling for
that big fat mistake I made here's
something to ease your worries perfect
couples do not exist real couples who
might fight who might look crusty one
day might have boogers in their eyes or
whatever that is the reality of couple
girls and when they come together all
perfect it's a once in a lifetime
scenario and I'm telling you it's not
every day the makeup looks and this
happens to be all the time I look at
certain profiles I'm looking at these
profiles and everybody does this contour
thing is in fast motion you know yes the
line there the 90 of the parrot contour
BAM everyone's all looking stunning but
when I do it and I have got mud and sand
on my face I look awful and I know that
when I walk down the street with that
kind of makeup people are looking at me
not in awe but in confusion the reality
is sometimes when you're looking at the
makeup that you see but it's the level
and the internet it's almost like stage
makeup it's much thicker even my YouTube
makeup but what I'm doing in this video
is much thicker than I would normally
wear because when you've got lighting
and pictures and angles you have to wear
makeups a bit heavier it doesn't
necessarily apply to real life scenarios
honestly when you're putting a stripe
here and a stripe here 10 shades darker
than your skin tone you're going to look
a hot mess in real life it might look
amazing on camera and you know when you
see people and they've got the flashing
in this part of their face is literally
fluorescent watching thing that looks
like in person
besides greasy I don't know but when I
have seen certain makeup in the flesh I
might oh maybe that looked a lot better
in picture then it does look in a person
so never feel like oh my gosh I'm off
what makeup way
terrible what you don't realize is that
a lot of the makeup is to create an
image of beauty to show debt to show
dimension and not necessarily to say
that someone that's better than someone
else it might be just to show how makeup
can work but you might need to turn it
down 20 steps to actually apply in real
life and also facetune is the boss if
you know about facetune all you need to
do is a little bit of skin smoothing a
little bit I white me and make the eyes
a little bit bigger put a bit more
highlight here and you know lip pumping
on the app that is what a lot of people
are doing so next up it's material
things and obviously we all love to show
our friends when we have something nice
I meet up with my friends and I'm like
girl this is what I bought I go through
my friends closets all that kind of good
stuff but often I feel that people are
affected when they see that everybody's
you know they've got this new bag
they've got this new shoe I'm seeing 18
year old Louboutins and vilette's yard
listen when I was 18 I had Primark that
was it at Primark at the market that are
maybe Topshop if I was feeling spendy
but nowadays kids of that age have a lot
more and sometimes I do feel like some
of us can think oh my god they've got
the most perfect life but again you
never know what it took to one get those
things you don't know if those lubes you
see in a picture have ever touched the
floor or been out the box or whether or
not it's just an empty box full of hopes
and dreams you do not know and actually
I saw the most hilarious meme where
there was like a go in her in her like
bikini and boots and it was snowing and
someone was taking a photo for and it
was like her Mike's will keep her warm
and I thought was absolutely hilarious
because the reality is people do so much
for Instagram or to create an illusion
of perfection and having so much amazing
stuff but you don't know what that
situation is to actually get there so
the key thing that I think you can do is
to keep your eyes on your own prize when
you're
Oh Road and the reality is if you do
have you know so much opportunity to
have so many material things it's a
little bit cringy to continuously put it
in the faces of people finally life
goals in general you see some people who
are on a yacht on the shard on kayaking
down the side of a mountain at the
fanciest restaurant and you're like my
life is just dry but let me be honest
the majority of the time given I've
shown those things 99.9 percent of the
time I'm sitting on my sofa watching
Netflix and chilling on my own obviously
people always show the best best bits
and there are times you can probably
reflect in your life where you've had an
amazing meal and amazing restaurant it's
not every day it's not every day 9:00
right there are times where you've been
you know blessed a bird amazing holiday
it's not every week it's maybe once a
year or twice a year or 172 years
depending on your circumstances so
remembering that people show the best
part of their knife is a way that you're
able to keep reality in check and often
if people are taking lots of photos of a
moment they're not able to be present at
that time and can't be having the most
amazing time in the world I've seen
places which are dead dry dry dry dry
dry parties everything but people are
like a most amazing party ever the room
is empty there's no one dancing they
take a picture and they go away from the
venue but to create the persona of
having a great time and it's more
important so I say it's more important
to be present and enjoy every single
moment that you get is actually to add
back to your life not necessarily to add
back to your likes so remembering and
taking on board and being in that moment
means that you'll have a much more
fulfilled and enriched life so guys I
had to get that off my chest it's
something that I have been thinking
about I'm going to be doing a room
very amusing once in a while I don't
know how regularly if there's anything
else you think I should talk about or
that you see or that you relate to in
the world that we live in today let me
know in the comments we'll speak on it
well touching it what I really want to
know from you guys is that do you
genuinely believe the photos that you
see it and not that photos are fake but
it's a case of sometimes things look so
perfect do you actually believe that
people's lives are actually perfect or
do you potentially see that they shared
a nice image of that moment but also
there's real lives and real stories
behind it or do you just see the rose
tinted glass glasses and just something
everyone has got life goals going on
because I know there's lots of people
who want to create that image of
perfection but honestly it's not true
and I am the first person to put my
hands up and say we go through it all I
look like cross 99% of the time
especially if you look at my snapchat
and my vlogs this ain't happening
because I'm too lazy for that but yeah
let me know in the comments and let me
know what you want to see next time
thanks for watching guys and I will
catch you on Thursday
