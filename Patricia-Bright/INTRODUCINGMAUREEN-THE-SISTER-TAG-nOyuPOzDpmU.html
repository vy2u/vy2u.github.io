for probably over a few years or so and
today we are going to do it and it's
there
since the tag that was rehearse by the
way but obviously good thing each other
okay we have got my sister Maureen and
here in City with me and thing is is
seat Yellen oh yeah and the is that
right Maureen's fairy aunty YouTube to
return you listen to i i'm not aunty
youtube i just would rather be behind
the lens is it on my blog channel a lot
more so i've been able to get her here
on the main channel so we're just going
to go ahead and answer the questions and
um I'm not sure how to the work but I'm
going to say basically you just answer
and yeah we're just uh yeah I'm so above
other so how old do you both do I say
how would you what I think I can I can
take this one I am 24 and I am 25 i feel
like my postures written badi describe
each other in one word uncle mine's so
easy mine so nice a watch it's gonna be
hot okay yeah you just described me in
one word and I'll describe you one word
the boss that's not one word then both
little boss then boss man you can take
it however you want
no you know does see your shoulders off
yes boss I like that one high five and
more you do that she gonna be no don't
granny she knew that was gonna be great
actually mom said that no one's about to
call me granny anymore I don't care what
I said yeah she said from the year 2013
I'm officially not allowed to be called
ready so FYI KGB but anyway I'm calling
her granny you know
I don't agree it's not going out to that
grimy
I vote me back but definitely grabbing
do people ever get you mixed up yeah yes
yes wait yes wait a minute Lee many
times one in the house they'll call like
Patricia a morning will answer or laugh
oh that's a bit first don't get mixed up
but definitely you just answer on behalf
of each other Mari yes
I'm cheap yes but no I don't think we do
I think we used to usually hammocks a
lot babies are the newer twins or we
were the same people but there are
people for I thought you were moving or
something like that
I think maybe the way we speak the way
we said yeah oh yeah that was a good
game I used to like playing I like high
loads more in a more granny a tone
basically whatever now she's become a
beauty guru and no I don't think we get
mixed up at all what is something that
annoys annoys you about one another I'm
gonna hear yours first um
Patricia's really like regimented so she
plans out her days and like 15-minute
increments of her days and what she's
doing up what particular time and if
forever for whatever reason things don't
go according to schedule
woman there's trouble she's like that's
her tree yeah she's such a control freak
that she can't just get things be
sometimes or just chill and relax we've
got if you're not on her schedule get
out the way hence the terms the boss but
yeah you will be bulldozed down that is
hilarious that is so true but it hurts
oh yeah that's rubbering okay I tell you
I'll tell you what annoys me about Maury
Maury does not like to be asked to do
things so that's
a big spreadsheet please do use the same
can you is that no the responses so like
back up against the wall look if someone
axes her to do something that's not
really is Charlotte Vienna convene
except in person it is true if you ask
more like for like right no I think the
only reason or if I ever question it
it's because I feel like why can't you
do it yourself
what my it myself asking you what is
what does Brooke will your hands that
you can't do it right if I could do it
myself I wouldn't aren't you yeah that
annoys me
we're not annoyed now but I need to know
it's true mine anyway what is it like
being a sister with sisters of the
YouTube guru
I guess as question is for me um even
the word guru is kind of weird but yeah
I guess you are like a fashion beauty
blog on blogger person when we go out
like if we go out shopping and things
like that we're going to be stopped
not weird she's going to be stopped and
I'm going to hang there in the corner
looking kind of awkward thinking oh okay
nice and but to be fair I really like it
and especially when like the younger
girls come up oh my god you're so so you
what do you think me that's it brick pop
princess what do they call you don't
even know much channel name that is just
a love for you it is love like yeah you
know I love you anything that's right
like oh my god I'm so inspired or in a
new channel gumbo so yeah I think it's
really nice how people um not only take
on her fashioning in advice but like
just her advice in general I find people
yeah okay that alternative that's a bit
too nice for you there
thank you you ever argue and I'm not
really not not a lot ready
that's because we were never really
to argue no no's ever an argument you
litter like if the tone got slightly
raised in my house litchi you'll hear my
mom like running up this day right No
Hey Oh Oh my bra set we weren't even
given the moment desk lit but yeah here
and there but not regularly what's the
best thing about one another you first
and for me it basically means that if I
want to go on a rant or there's a moment
literally Maury you'll never believe her
liver Lac more and more mm-hmm my gosh
mm-hmm I just want to talk I just want
to talk and go on might be about
nonsense it might just be breathing oh
 but Maureen will definitely answer
and there's a fairly good listening ear
and actually a voice of reason very much
voice of reason
yeah damn I think she's the sensible one
so I can be like Jesus everyone is what
oh you need to see it from this side so
that is very very good thing about her
actually quite like that got that one
thanks Trish
that was nice excited laugh only go
ahead me um she just gets it she just
gets me but the here I get you your just
bear with me like only recently started
doing this thing hopefully you know that
um Family Guy thing you're glowing
our family garden never change
Livingston
are you yeah we really started doing
this thing where we see something that
looks a bit um I don't know what this is
a see no oh no oh
I know you talking about yeah you get it
she did it we just get it we have our
own Oh sense of humor
we might just give each other the look
or sometimes there's a bit of a pinch or
a little bit of at oh we got a job is it
a genocide I got this little oh so like
yeah yeah so we definitely have those
moments where we entirely get it yes
also she gives the best gifts wow that's
so random do I really do are you just
yes I didn't know that you do have never
been highlighted for doing best gifts oh
that's nice and I just stopped recording
but I was just about to tell you like
bits of dirt for mooring being the fact
that sometimes she says stuff like out
loud that really you just wouldn't say
and it can be quite insulting like you
wonder - you're speaking - like I think
I'm manager or something and they're
talking about you told me about this
actually that um you know getting a
boyfriend or something and she's like I
would never be 30 and have no boyfriend
and this woman was like 40 was no
boyfriend I shouldn't be like who wants
to be that woman I got oh I really
wasn't nice
you know said the single and woman alone
as Letty and all I remember I would
never forget the time we were in church
and we were singing like this is like
the children's choir like Maureen being
a 10 year old child she what she was
we're singing you know we've learned
that good and bitchy on the mic mommy
when that sounded awful
like in front the whole congregation
it's like who are you please stop these
things got trickle out of your mouth and
that's it but I really don't know oh ok
she's not perfect now the only thing
that I can think of when this is really
rubbish is that Tricia have a thing with
Footwear like she's got loads and loads
and loads you don't know what I'm gonna
say I mean no idea why everything in
those modes of shoes right and I'm sure
she shared this with you but she has
rather big feet and there are time there
are times where she's like oh what no
shoes I want those shoes I can wear them
in size insert big size here and I'm
looking at this year I'm thinking no
probably not going to be able to fit and
she will buy them anyway and sometimes
the slight slightly crease right over
the edge of the ship that is all right I
think back and I'm thinking well you
weren't really that to begin with but
that is so just a little dirt rude I
cannot believe you just said that
favorite inside joke
oh we're kind of just going on on that
right Oh glue you doing favorite memory
together why not - Erica well one of the
younger we used to go out a lot like in
insane amount and four times a week yeah
it was intense
I'm like I just haven't yeah memories of
us going oh
you sweated shoe break in life yeah
that's a lots of good times and you guys
used to come up to mention yeah I'm up
to Manchester and we'd always go out do
you remember that school uniform party
yeah we had shirts out please it's go oh
Lord
it was good times and we used to just
finger began Jewish it always used to be
in the note or should always have a hook
up somewhere somehow so it would just be
a good oh good I didn't always have
hookups yeah and I was go and my my
looks are going to be a holidays mine
was going to be because we used to spend
a lot of time in Italy yeah so yeah we
used to spend a lot of time in Italy
when we were younger because we've got a
cousin who lives out there in Mantova
and literally our summers we used to
spend like six weeks just it was the
most amount of fun ever because we were
never allowed out not only weren't
allowed out but our mum it was quite you
know strict stay in the house read your
book so but we used to go to Italy
and my cousin was like I'm going to play
outside I think what play outside me and
warring gallabat we were ready ready I
was cycling by myself for hours
we did freedom that's how we learned how
to ride a bike literally you can it get
us back in the house after that we had
so much fun
she came with her first crush his eyes
oh my gosh that's not all about that
about this no boy I'm gonna say isn't it
obviously but oh my god every hour of
every McGirt oh yeah oh oh my god is he
outside oh oh
lightly so oh good I look back and think
yeah thank you for ha will fulfil
sisters each other's very right seeing
our Oh both of us that really listened
to contemporary music I wouldn't have a
clue
Watson do they even have shots anymore I
don't know Trisha is really into like
IHOP and stuff so um I guess from that
Jay Thomas would be like I'm saying je
tourne eventually but then the thing is
is that yeah right now Jay Thomas is
like my favorite person to listen to
yeah so that's actually who's in my head
but then we like really old school music
so like 90s yeah nineties we're talking
Dru Hill only talking genuine you're
yours yet again I think it's the same
thing but I was going to say brandy for
you yeah I was gonna say brandy family
who takes longer to get ready
I think Maureen takes longer to get a
meal actually agree more me and actually
takes for ever to get ready what are you
doing you know that really isn't much
hair to deal with over there it's not
even my hair I just like to shake that
side can i this is a line ice it's not
cancer I know it's not but it's my old
prep no good but um yeah Maureen takes a
lot hit me a little heels or flats I
would have said heels but recently
recently I'm definitely becoming a hat
person and mooring will definitely be
flats as well ants or dresses and
dresses definitely dresses Moyne would
be jeans or skinny jeans shorts pants
eeeh shoes yeah
favorite animal animal animal Kimiko no
no I don't do animals no zero on the
animal front but now if you had to pick
an animal
tonight what would you pick but I have
to pick for you you know what if I had
to pick an actually recently Trish has
been saying what she wants a job yeah
that's true let's it's a move in today
yeah but I'm not actually I say yeah I
know matching yeah
you're very fleeting but for the here
and now I know but I want to be my
favorite animal in like a peacock not
you know but I got a blue feathers now
you know yet dog for me no for me you me
for you know it's actually a sickness
it's something that is more I need
anything out I come here by kilo base
left no I don't know the matter would be
something at small but wouldn't be a
Roden it would be actually think it
might be like a murder look a little
guinea pig or something if your house
was burning down and your entire family
was sure to be okay what would you save
and why what do I think you would save
your Garmin you're not really precious
at well I'm not when you push it's about
my you know I know thing I don't never
got a hit on the house of them picked
something up um pictures yeah no I'll
let you make new memories right yeah I
to be fair I don't know I think you
might say your laptop or your computer
or something all yeah my but let it fry
I personally don't think any of us are
we're not very precious out matterial
things so if the family's safe then I
don't feel I don't need to go back in
and get anything else I just get some
meals comedy horror or chiclet comedy
horror me oh so not comedy comedy of
those yeah yeah forget that if you're
gonna pick a movie genre what movie John
would you would you pick and I say you
pick sci-fi yeah yeah dissing and I
would pick sci-fi like the audience
I found there like come on battery off
iPhone iPhone favorite movie oh I think
we both got the same favorite movie yeah
so also should we just list them up yep
on Romeo Juliet
look we're Romeo and Juliet with
Leonardo DiCaprio Leone ah well in that
the important when she was like 14 just
amazing in that French actress what's
his name Jack I can't remember get city
of God you've got whatever it's always
neon
oh yes men though both of the favorites
it was something weird that you II I
don't know she just eats meat like me
for breakfast with lunch
I'll just me and Isaac something weird
that you II I think it was is ketchup on
right bread I think no Sherman any
ketchup on bread but the fact that you
might put like a you know an egg
sandwich like Friday got for breakfast
and there's ketchup touching the bread
that's just weird
it's not we that makes as nasty so
kitchen and it's in bread no no it's not
in the bread plate are you take and then
the other bread touches are I don't
sandwich it though I have one slice and
then you've got the egg on top and
ketchup on it now your vision That's not
me delicious and do you have anything
matching loads of things those are
things that you've got that I've bought
so not I think oh okay I was
interpreting it differently I thought
they meant like features all like but
you're talking about clothes clothes on
and yeah that's weird features while
features no nothing yeah I think so
clothing wise title I and no style is
hands down better than hers so um she's
forever copying things that I buy oh my
God where did you get that from oh my
why didn't you get many one that is this
statement gobbler what's your favorite
