of energy I have when I see sly rays of
sunlight because the struggle is so
epically real back at home and I'm here
for Coachella in LA for the next two or

gonna shop I'm gonna go to all the use
these stores I don't normally go to

top from white fox booty I feel like it
it's very very LA and I thought my skin
has really been popping a lot recently
actually that's not true I have like
half good skin days and then half bad
skin days but when I have a bad skin day
normally I just do my skincare routine
which I did last night and then this

like not even using it but yeah this is
the shade topaz which is just bought

this is but it is absolutely gorgeous

me I'm gonna put on some Becca this
morning
I'm so in the mood why just want to keep
like working on my skin making it look
as radiant and as youthful as possible
and not messing about on my skincare
routine because at the end of the day
when your skin feels good I feel like
you feel better you know I'm gonna break
into the new highlight topaz I'm ready
