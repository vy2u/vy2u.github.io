their faith about the charged carbon is
considered to be the best formation in
the entire world they determined this
formation can set you back a cool 95
part if you don't know about this one
basically what you need to get to know
this is the new land contents particular
and this has been lodged in the UK I
think about a week ago two weeks ago and
I got the chance to go in early
this video is not funded they have not
asked me to make a video or anything
like that but I heard about this
foundation coming out and I was like no
I want to go in I want to try this
foundation as early as I possibly can so
this is basically a custom-made
foundation go there a machine they put
it on your face three different points
and they work out more your different
shades based on an algorithm they're
getting technical out here and then they
make your own custom foundation based on
a number of different factors which i
think is like my brother going to be
genuinely honest with you right so this
is from Lancome I love Lancome
foundation full stop right so my two
favorites I love the ten eyes aw I love
the ten mill call I also like the
cushion foundation I have that here as
well so I'm a I'm a die-hard
Lancome foundation fan I think that
their colorant is amazing the saturation
is amazing so yeah that's just on this
point of view but we need to be honest
about you know the new product if you're
going to be passing with 95 pounds you
need to know that this is actually about
to be the real deal and another knife
this look at the box beau look at the
glass this box is so gorgeous it's so
epic and then look at the foundation
which is it kind of weird because it
feels like there's nothing in it feels
very nice those might have been these
bottles because this is that made out of
the glass bottle this is actually made
out of a maybe like a plastic bottle
this is customized exclusively for
Patricia and also I have a complexion ID
and a bachelor
if I ever gonna go back in there's like
a number on it but yes so I've had it
done in store and popular honest opinion
I didn't have a lot of time in store
that was kind of a rush because it was
like the first date had launched it was
quite a lot of people waiting and I felt
like I just needed a little bit longer
to really get that perfect match in the
store I felt like it was a touch too
light and but I did have the chance to
up for a darker shade and I want to
compare it to my normal foundation in
the middle is actually the 10th peculiar
and all the other sides are my normal to
10th foundations so I mentioned that I
felt like it was a little bit too light
and as you can see here it is slightly
lighter than my other normal foundation
anyway so comparing it it is a touch
light but what I like is that it's quite
yellow and I thought I have more yellow
rather than red undertones so I'm just
going to go ahead and go in with that
foundation so what do you know what it
was a little bit light for me but the
way it is sinking into my skin did you
just see that that just sunk yes oh I
was looking at it when I put it on my
hand like not no honey this isn't going
to be right but the way is just blending
in and what I'm noticing is that this is
more yellow and actually select my skin
is coming through as well I'm using a
lot why am i using so much this is 95
pounds this thin it needs to be one ton
you know what I don't like the Beauty
Blender I'm using this beauty blender is
not a proper Beauty Blender and it's
just a bit stiff just changing my beat
blender does that one is so dead I'm
telling you that I'm loving and loving
this and literally loving it the way
it's going on my skin is different to
what it looks like when I pump
on my hand this is why the hand contact
sometimes may be flawed but in my first
shot put a decimal what I thought it was
going to look like it is definitely less
coverage than my 10 I felt definitely a
lot less coverage but it is I look even
I look radiant
I look healthy this is a great everyday
foundation this is the foundation if you
want that be right but that is a really
good everyday foundation up who knows if
you're going to spend money if I have 9
to 5 pounds of them in every day for our
nation that's another story however
okay let me put the rest of my face on
and see what I think of the finish
results
you
and they said just take a peek of what
that looks like my skin looks I feel
flawless it's like my skin and can see
my skin underneath it double it like
this it looks like there's nothing on
but just really even it's not a very
full coverage foundation but it really
has helped cover up my blemishes and
just make my skin look a little bit more
aging and I'm showing you this before
ever prize any like peril dirt or
anything I even still need to blend
where that concealer things in that
blend is right okay so let me finish
everything and then give you my final
thoughts on these okay so overall I'm
loving loving loving loving this
foundation it's basically my skin but
better like a girl like it actually
doesn't look like I'm wearing a thick or
heavy foundation and Lonnie I love me a
full coverage I'm over ten eyes all kind
of girl and it just feels like my skin
at but better that makes any sense and I
feel like it just is that many not very
even but without looking very very heavy
over here they mention our keep mention
is that I'm surprised that what it pumps
out on my hand looks very different to
what it looks like on my face so I
wasn't really able to judge by what I
saw on my hand because normally if I've
done that hand pump out of it I know
this is it to me but now that sort of my
specs I'm like really like really but
what you see is that it allowed my skin
to also come through to really match
being a custom match basically it does
what it says on the ten people as if
there's ninety five pounds with it
nicely found it seven - pounds with 95
pounds it's expensive okay it's an
expensive foundation this isn't a
foundation that you're going to wear
everyday to the corner shop but I feel
like if you have weddings or special
occasion or maybe you've got money to
spend on your perfect foundation and
it's differently an option but you know
I do feel like a lot of us we just mix
foundation to get that perfect shade but
what I really like is that it has more
the yellow undertone but is the red
undertones
I often find in most of my foundations
for my skintone I'm very impressed
I actually think it's worth it because
I'm a kind of person who I will pay for
foundation I will pay for my skincare
I'll pay for my foundation and that's me
is important and yeah this is this is
great prop the box it comes in is super
cute super cute so those are my thoughts
on this custom foundation would you go
paying 95 pounds for that perfect
foundation would you let me know in the
comments below and in the meantime I'll
catch you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
