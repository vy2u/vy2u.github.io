whole video for you guys today
yay yeah you guys know I love a whole
video and I basically done some nice
online shopping and a little bit more
shopping elsewhere and stuff I'm doing a
lot of traveling over the next few weeks
so I wanted to get some nice summery
bits and I've been loving a bit more
color and stuff I mean I still love
black white grey but I've been you know
dressing up a little bit more in pink
and orange and colorful stuff which I
feel like everyone really likes and I
feel happier in color
and but yeah I wanted to do a whole
video today I'm glad that you guys
enjoyed my video like my a couple of
days ago and in regards to blow up and
everything like that I'm thinking I'm
gonna do a video where I basically watch
back my videos and then like comment on
them and people do these all the time
but I've never done it I think I'm gonna
do it I think we need that let me know
in the comments if you think we need
that in the meantime and get coffee
get comfortable cause we're gonna submit
Tam how I suffered um how I saw dancing
okay so I can't quite find the other
shoe right now so I'm gonna show you one
of the shoes these are some sandals from
River Island and I am loving anything
lace up you're gonna see I'm loving lace
yes I'm a bit of a trend whore I do love
a trend if it suits me and I love these
kind of lace-up sandals and it's got a
bit of a snake print to it I can't know
how much these were but they are quite
affordable they're the hanging shoes
from River Island and I just want them
make a really nice summertime sandal
next I bought this little cute orange
ruffle top also from River Island and it
had like matching trousers that were
like wide-leg oh my gosh the camel toe
it gave me was out of this world it
literally looked like a pouch and you
could see everything as I know I have no
time for this camel toe although like as
a matching suit it looked amazing and so
I couldn't keep the trousers but the top
is so gorgeous I love the floatiness to
the top and just how it looks and I feel
like I look good in orange and my
colors like this so yeah after that I
bought this jacket now I actually
already have this jacket in the black
but I saw the kind of suede beige and I
think it's really just a really nice
jacket it's quite pricey because it is
suede it was a hundred and fifty pounds
but I do feel like it's one of those
nice standout pieces for the season I -
for it was really nice so I basically
went ham on misguided I usually do cuz
I've not bought anything from misguided
for probably about three months now and
because I've just been shopping
elsewhere and I right now I need some
good misguided bits yeah and they've got
some really nice stuff they're killing
it with the lace I love lace right now
and I'm going to France for a party and
well I can't my what part of France I'm
going to we're going to Rennes and which
is this really nice coming like sort ow
my friends having a party out there and
I thought I just wanted like a really
cute dress to wear I saw this dress and
thought it would be a really nice piece
I hope it's not too bright but it's got
the lacing down the middle which I think
it's really really gorgeous and then the
lace on the sleeves and I love the fit
and the nymph of the dress sticking with
the trend but I also ended up getting
this dress which is also in lace up as
well but I love the fear and I wanted a
plain black one as well they I mean I'll
be honest the lace is a trend at the
moment you know anything that is kind of
70s inspired but I don't mind buying
into a trend if it's going to suit me so
I know that flares and wide-leg trouser
trousers don't suit me so I'm not gonna
buy into that trend right now but I love
a dress you guys know I love a dress and
I think that's a really nice piece in
the summer I love to wear like a little
dress rather than jeans on the top I
like to throw on a dress and so I got
this gray wrap dress which you can't
tell how good at wrapping it is but this
is a really nice basic and the material
is very very nice it will wash really
really well and I like to have like a
black white grey kind of dress that I
can wear any time of day just fling it
on a fling on a jacket so I thought this
was a really nice piece I then also
picked up this gorgeous gorgeous rat
over great jumpsuit this jumpsuit is
amazing and I let me came out the bag as
a bit like
no not not sure about you love but put
it on oh my gosh it was so buff and it's
just so nice of the girls who don't want
to always wear a dress or something like
that a jumpsuit is totally good so I
bought this lace up hill and I just
thought it was super cool I know it's
like quite a trendy or you know stand up
piece but sometimes over the summer I
can imagine when I can really nice Beach
caftan and a shoe like this and I
haven't got anything like this I'm
trying to be a bit braver with my look I
mean I feel like I simplified but you
know there's nothing wrong with
experimenting so I also bought this lacy
kind of dressy number and the reason why
I've got this is mainly to wear over my
beach wear so anytime I'm at a beach and
I don't want to necessarily walk around
with my bikini I can just throw this on
and look on fleek and look really really
nice and you can also wear like a little
top and a little skirt or short shorts
and make it an actual look I then went
ahead and bought these sandals I had
basically bought like four pairs of
sandals like this I love them I like to
buy the new set of sandals for the
summertime that I like kind of sexy the
kind of casual and then kind of like
comfortable I think these are really
nice mix between like really nice heeled
sandals and casual sandals because
there's a slight hill and I love again
this wrap front it's gorgeous
love it so as I mentioned that I've
gotten sandal crazy so don't eat my head
off or anything like that
I also bought these lace-up ones in a
kind of gray and it's kind of like a
soft teal grey not a soft duck egg gray
and I saw Tasha green hey Tasha it's all
her I'll link her channel below I saw
her wearing these at beautycon and I was
like those are amazing and then I went
on to office and office had them and I
was like I need to buy these shoes
they're so so gorgeous and they're so me
like kind of girly nothing kind of
sticking with the trend I bought a pair
of mules I am obsessed with this kind of
hue of kind of a blue-gray duck egg gray
and I bought these mules and they're
really nice I think these are my only
pairs of mules you guys know that I have
the biggest feet in the world and I'm
always a bit funny when it comes to
Footwear I don't have the best footwear
cuz
got you know sighs UK and I'm not very
tall and everything makes me look have a
boatful it has to be really careful but
these are gorgeous I love them
oopsie I forgot to show you that I also
got these really nice glasses from
misguided I think that sorry they've got
the new bit on it
they're only about 10 pounds or
something and I think they're really
nice for me I have to be careful cuz I
have kind of like a moon head and if I'm
not careful with the kind of glasses I
pick up they look like a pie but these
are really good I really like them I
also bought this whole tunic and it's
just a basic to have I should probably
get this in black white grey in a color
but I haven't I just got the black one I
like this to wear with a pair of shorts
or something tonight the festivals and
that kind of stuff and it looks really
really nice and I love anything I can
like quickly whip on and wig off
so I also picked up this kind of
waistcoat it's kind of in a camel color
I'm not sure if the camera is picking it
up and I just love little jackets like
this over the summertime to throw on my
outfit because although it is summer
this is England and ah summer doesn't
quite understand what summer means so
there will always be a breeze or a rain
at some point in time which means that
you always need to throw something like
a little jacket on so I also went on to
a sauce and bought a couple of bits as
well I bought this off the shoulder top
I love showing my shoulders and my
clavicle it's like the sexy part of me
and I love the fact that it kind of had
that little shoulder but still had a
sleeve because it's not everyday that
you want to be sleeveless and I just
thought this was a really nice pretty
basic top that you can wear with lots of
different things I then bought this wrap
of bodies this is actually an American
Apparel I realized but they sell
American Apparel on the site and for me
I'm just loving having really nice
basics that I can throw on it's about 28
pounds or something so it's quite
expensive for something so basic but the
material is very good I will say that I
then picked up this dress and I only
wanted this dress on the beach I don't
plan
wellness at any point in time while I'm
in London it's this gorgeous kind of rap
front dress and it's got like a gap down
the middle I'll wear it so you can see
actually what it looks like it's a
little bit low at the front so I'm gonna
have to kind of get it stitched up but
the dress is absolutely gorgeous and I'm
just thinking of the times when I'm on
the beach and looking fabulous
you know sipping a piña colada I dunno
it's summer but it's this morning this
cocky contrast Jackie and I'm telling
you we have like weird summer here some
days it rains sometimes the sky is gray
and horrible most of the time actually
so I was like I wanted this cocky jacket
because I just thought it was really
really nice
I could make a really nice outfit with
it and I love a tomboy look you know
once in a while so some of you guys
might have noticed as well I got my
setup has changed it kind of always does
I've got some really nice home where
bits from Urban Outfitters they just got
some really nice stuff in their stores
it's insane and I've got this little pot
for like rings and stuff like that and
then they also have this kind of pot
over here which has got my nail polish
and stuff in there so I'll do some
close-ups over there oh and then this
waistcoat is also from Urban Outfitters
well I stand up so you guys can see but
this is a really really nice kind of
long waistcoat thing which is pretty and
I also picked up some jewelry pieces
people always ask me about where I get
my little small necklaces from I just
get them from Urban Outfitters they have
so many really nice pieces they're 10
pounds 8 pounds 12 pounds this is a
really nice a piece of hand jewelry and
then this is just a really nice kind of
long necklace they have such a varieties
that you can wear that is so stylish and
really affordable so if you know you do
lose them or break them like I do all
the time you can just go and buy more
pieces I love these so guys that is
basically it for me and I hoped you guys
enjoyed and wanted to have a little
chitchat but we'll talk in other videos

bit more consistent with my uploads I do
