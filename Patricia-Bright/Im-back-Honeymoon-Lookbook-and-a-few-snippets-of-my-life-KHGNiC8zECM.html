I'm a different woman so now yes guys I
have got married for those of you who
don't know in the past 3-4 weeks
so many things have happened there have
been so many changes and just changes in
my life you guys have been following me
for ages you guys know what's happened
so I got married quit my job but there
will come a new drop I'll tell you all
about it in another video and have a
huge wedding but on honeymoon in the
person's of moving in with my fiance
with my life you don't say my husband
and I'm here today to tell you the tale
oh and I reached a hundred thousand
subscribers oh yes I think that's been
the highlight probably up but amazing
news so a lot of a lots and lots of
happen but I'm back today in the
beautiful rainy gray London which I've
missed of mr. videos I've missed just
talking to you guys you know I mean but
it's been a whirlwind a whirlwind a few
weeks really and I'm going to be able to
tell you all about it in the coming
weeks and stuff I don't wanna pop our do
too much with wedding and my third vlog
stuff so if you think of vlog channel is
a good idea let me know put up this
video
it's basically holiday looks now we're
not in a holidays yet but we will be in
holidays soon hopefully the weather
starts improving and we can then think
about packing norway for sun at sea
so my first outfit that i think is
perfect on the beach perfect for warm
with up and just looks really casual is
a short and a vest now with shorts
they're like just you know lady you get
to see lots of legs you get to feel
really comfortable and then the vests
and especially the racerback best
because you get a bit of shoulder
carriage and a bit of that cleavage I
just love a bit of that looks gorgeous
next thing is the summer dress but the
summer dress is amazing because you can
just throw it on over your bikini or
something like that if you feel like it
but even nicer is I got a Denver one
which I put picked up in was I fit up it
heavy that from Primark and I saw this
is lovely and it looks really cute and
really feminine for those of you who are
more feminine on the beach
and next is of the wrong part I
absolutely love rompers jumpsuits cooler
outfits we're all in ones basically
because again you can just kind of like
shimmy them on over a bikini and they
just keep look really gorgeous and love
florals for summer and the beach because
it just looks so radiant and came out
paddling pool pool c1 or wherever you
are and just look really gorgeous in it
the case of maxi Jess this is fully
fully debated especially if you're short
now I'm sure right when I'm about five
foot five and figure out you are no sure
Mac suggests this don't look good and
short girls they look fine
I would suggest though wearing like an
all-black one like I have an all-black
one and it looks really slimming and
like elongating and to add a pop of
color I just add on and it was scarf
finding middle the maxi skirt and the
boob tube now I always used to people
use a tacky but depend well and we you
wear me and I know the maxi skirt
covering the bellybutton
it's gorgeously elegant</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
