favorite or should I say the first
favorites of the year so this is a very
important favourites for me if you
haven't seen my last video you have
noticed that I am now part of the
unicorn crowd I've been trying to get
here for a while so yes my hair is pink
is she a lavenderish a whole bunch of
different colors but I only use one
color long story
I'm going to do a hair video see we're
going to go through the whole shebang
when it comes to Patricia's hair so keep
an eye out for that but today I have a
favorites video and I'm actually feeling
very very excited about this one as I
always say get comfortable get a cup of
tea cause it might be chatty and then
little bit long but it's fine you got
sad you got sad just take a break okay
so first thing I wanted to say this
video is in collaboration with the
lovely lovely Essie button and I
actually met her probably about a year
ago I reached out to her and she's
lovely went to ping pong had some food
have a chat but overall all that kind of
stuff
and she has an amazing channel for those
of you who haven't seen it before I'm
going to link out in my description bar
below she's very honest there's a loss
of integrity there and you know you can
basically trust what she's saying she
knows her products to a tee and is
always on top of stuff and the most
important factor she's part of the tea
crew okay though she's not a brick
she's kind of like honorary because she
she lost her tea as well which is great
because you guys know that I live
breathe eat sleep drink tea so yes check
her out down below so the first thing
that I want to show as a favorite has
got to be the tartlet palette I believe
this came right in January I did a shoot
rivet art back in November race or
something and I knew this palette was
going out and to be honest it is amazing
not only does it just have a
nice design but it's really nice matte
eyeshadows okay I have a lot of shimmers
and stuff like that but this is a just
the sexiest neutral eyeshadow palette so
so nice my favorite colors I was
actually picked to be the natural beauty
on this but my favorite color is
wanderer because I find that this is a
really warm brown and I mix that with
dreamer actually it's kind of how I
created the look I'm wearing today but
it's a very very nice palette nice and
matte and I think that people really
need like one shimmer palette one matte
matte palette actually that's a lie you
need like three map palettes and then
three shimmer palette so that would be
like an idol makeup collections and I
prefer palettes to like individual like
pots of color it's just easier you get
more variety so that's definitely a
favorite of mine next it is the Avene is
their having thermal spray it's a
sunscreen you guys know that I truly
believe in sunscreen no matter what your
skin tone is a lot of people have seen
like changes in my skin and it's
literally because I started to use
sunscreen more one of the problems that
I found with really good or high SPF
sunscreens is that they just made me
look blue like genuinely there's like a
blue sheen on me and probably because of
this color my skin is just like what is
that and you can definitely see it and I
always have to wear makeup over it this
one does not if she like that it's so
good and they're always very oily
besides the shishito one the shishito
one is out of this world but it makes me
literally luminous blue but this is not
oily at all really really mattifying and
I can just spray it on my face and like
rub it in but just spray my hand is
easier amazing and it's back to 50 and
there's loads and loads in it so I think
this is a really really good product you
guys know that I've probably talked
about skin clinic for about four years
okay and I they don't sell this item in
Boots anymore so you have to go to an
actual clinic
to get it but I picked up the anti
blemish pore refining lotion if you've
been watching me long enough you know
that I have this kind
t-zone like large pores which actually
I've had a chat with them and they don't
believe that their large pores in their
like said kind of like whiteheads that
just don't come over the skin I know
that's a bit gross so I'm gonna have
some kind of treatment on it what I did
get was this pore refining lotion and it
contains vitamin A and glycolic acid two
things that I think are great if you
want to smooth out your skin and even
your skin tone amazing and it will give
you the most amount of glow but I
started to apply this on my nose every
other night and I've got really thick
skin like it just doesn't budge but I've
really found that it really is kind of
shrunk them a little bit and I actually
feel like oh my gosh I might have a nose
without all the like bumps on it that I
actually hate so fingers crossed but I
found that this has really been great at
seeing actual results more than I've
seen with anything else that I do so
this must be really good if you might
have like larger pores or like something
like whiteheads as well you're kind of
on a refine or tight in your skin oh
next product million dollar moisturizer
from lush what can I say about this this
I love lush anyway but what I love about
this is that it's a moisturizer is SPF
30 but it's got kind of like an
iridescent glitter and if you guys can
see that it gives you the glow of life
when they say million dollar you know
like a million dollars trust me you I
like glowing and it's very reflective
and it's really beautiful like on the
beach again this was the product that I
was using a lot when I was on holiday
and I was kind of like getting in the
water wearing my million dollar
moisturizer this is really had me
feeling like a bit of a supermodel and
I'm sure I could put it on like my legs
as well there's not enough here to be
sharing it to the legs but to get like
that kind of iridescent contouring
that's what this kind of gives you you
can kind of keep reapplying it however
it is a little thick for those of you
guys who are just look so pretty on and
who have like really oily skin but I
really like that kind of beachy glow it
definitely gave me that uh-huh so this
is not a new product I've had this think
of my collection for like four months or
something but I haven't really been
wearing it but
some reason I think it was like when I
dyed my hair when I first bleached my
hair I was like I need something that
really pops got this one it's so amazing
it's an aqua blue this is a color 16
it's a matte lip product on one side and
then the gloss on the other side I just
use the matte alone right this matte
sticks to your lips
litchi what is that it's not going
anywhere okay it's matte for life okay
it's kind of it's more like a stain it's
more like a stain really really
pigmented really really bright I kind of
combined it with another lipstick that
I'm wearing now but maybe insert a
picture of me wearing it it's so bright
I love this color and then it's the
gloss over it I'm not really feeling
glossy like I say that while I wear
literally the most glossy lips you've
seen me wear like a month so yeah but
I'm really feeling a max at the moment
so next it is my giorgio armani goodies
i picked these up I was a Sharon Lee
actually when Selfridges the lady at the
store just kept selling not a lot that
she was selling it to us there's like a
discount on and she did my face I was
like damn it I have to buy this now it
was so so good and this is the luminous
silk foundation but this foundation is
literally like skin it's literally like
skin I used up my updated foundation
routine I'll link that video below I'm a
color 14 and it's literally like the
perfect color for me it's not too thick
is very jewy and I really like it my
only issue is that it's not the biggest
tub in the world like come on we need
more another two phase from Giorgio
Armani are the lip maestro and the flash
in the curl ah my matte lips this is my
matte lip for life okay long is another
product I'll show you in a second I love
this the color is everything this color
is the 500 it's a beautiful nude Amati
pinky that works perfectly on me and I
think it's gonna work on anyone if you
want my Kylie Jenner look this is this
and this is a really nice gloss that
makes it a bit pinky if I want to put
gloss on top of this oh these are
amazing
so keko keko is not a store that i went
into it will be a store that i will be
going into regular
is actually the one is so affordable and
stuffs really nice this liner here it is
a matte lip liner it's five one five I
this is my liner for everything I now
need to come pick this up in the brown I
need to pick this up in the purple I
need to pick this up in every color it's
so creamy and it's like rolling up one
so it's so easy to just apply you don't
need a sharpener and it's just really
really pigmented I've got it on now I
use it with my matte lipsticks I use it
with the makeup forever it just goes
with everything and it's really
high-quality I show that probably
showing you some of the other eyeshadow
that I got from there as well they're
like 399 or $2.99 may I just loaded up
my crane just like come on man come on
get in so so nice like oh I love it I
haven't tried their foundations or
anything I don't know if any of you guys
have they've got oh no I have a
concealer that I bought from them
actually haven't really tried it yet so
maybe I'll see how that goes but for
such a really good affordable option I'm
very excited by kiko finally it's the
insta blur from the body shop this is a
bit more I mean sorry guys I use it all
of the time I use it under my foundation
it mattifies me it keeps me it keeps my
makeup on right for the whole day
and it really does like refine
everything as well make it makes my skin
look smoother underneath my makeup I
don't know and I feel like my makeup
just looks better when I am wearing this
so my next favorite is gotta be my
selfie stick I know this sounds really
like you're so shallow or whatever / I'm
so late on having a selfie stick
but the selfie sticks are absolutely
everything I use this on the beach but I
find that it's just really useful to
take your photos I take photos all the
time that's the reality of the world we
live in nowadays and this just makes it
so much easier I did take this away with
me and it did get a bit rusty like I
won't like that I don't if you guys can
see it's a little bit rusty but it's not
really stopped like it's functioning or
anything and this was only 9
so it's a bargain I thought they were
like 40 quid or something this is only
nine pounds and they bought this in
Selfridges so yeah I went downstairs
I'll see if I can find the link oh and
look you can make it really small or
make it really long as well so perfect
so next I want to move on to books there
are two books that I want to show as
favorite it's feel the fear and do it
anyway I did a video on this that's how
good this book is I feel like it is
changing my life like genuinely and not
necessarily just the book the whole
concept of how you approach fear and
just be like you know what I don't care
that I'm scared I'm gonna do it anyway
I'm telling you it's just making so much
difference to me I'm like I don't really
feel as burdened by my nervousness I'm
just like oh well what's the worst that
can happen I'll be ignored or I'll lose
her money or whatever like the worst
thing that can happen is I die it's made
so much difference and I'm really
excited to where my life is going to go
if I continue to feel the fear and do it
anyway love it and then this next book
is by Caitlin Morin it's how to be a
woman hilarious literally hilarious I've
not finished it yet actually like maybe
I laugh at things like funny and just
really stupid things but I'm on the
train like laughing out loud to myself
hello I love books that make you feel
like I know what you're talking about I
don't know what you're talking about and
this is such a relatable book very very
funny I love it finally I want to talk
music I've had like a massive excitement
towards music recently female artists
are just killing it for me the two
albums that I bought that I really
wanted to talk about as my favorite is
number one it's the jazmine sullivan
album I think it's called reality show
sick so sick really good R&amp;amp;B if you guys
like R&amp;amp;B I love it I know it's a little
bit and I it kind of has it kind of
disappeared but I feel like it is making
a resurgence because some people are
making some good stuff even if it's
little bit more undergone or not
mainstream albums her album so good
she's so vocally amazing she gets weeks
she get makes me bring out my get
outside a little bit you know I got it
inside her and then also another person
who's come kind of on the complete
opposite of the spectrum but I respect
them in the same way is be your
something y'all don't know about Bjork
right I love Bjork she's one of my
favorite artists her and Lauryn Hill on
my favorite artist because of how they
just do everything just against against
the sister and she's got a new album
it's sick what's this other cool it's
called a world Nakula volnek Laura I
don't know if it's an actual word or not
and for me what I love about the York is
her vocal like her vocal range is insane
and just the way she sings it just sends
shudders just down you I just love her
and I'm glad that she's still doing
music you know love it but guys that
those are all my favorites and for the
beginning of the year I really hoped you
enjoyed I'm gonna try and do them
monthly
I don't really do favorites monthly
because I don't have monthly favorites
but I have seasonal favorites so I'll
keep doing them as and when I can I have
a hair video coming soon and thank you
guys so much for watching and I'll see
you guys later it is anything else No
thank you for watching guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
