today's just going to be a quick
tutorial on this hairstyle here and it's
basically the kind of the two braids
it's fairly common I decided just to
jazz it up with a few hair rings and
these are the herrings that I got for
regal rowers and I thought it was really
different I think it's really nice for
someone if you just want a nice festival
look or something
I think the herrings are really good
idea they're really easy to do all you
need to do is open them up pull them
open like that and then when they're in
we push them closed really really simple
and that's it for all of you who want to
know my name's comment or on my Facebook
page of my Twitter and Instagram icon do
where I do the live vlogs on Sundays so
guys I'll see you later and fence
watching bye so guys I start off with
fairly clean and straight hair but I
brush it out this and your knots and
tangles this is not mandatory but I'm
going to do a middle part you could do a
side part if you want to but I think the
middle is a bit more classic and all I
do is take a section from the front and
braid it up this isn't really a braid in
tutorial video but if you did one form
then leave a comment below and I can
look at maybe doing that for you but
basically I just loop one side over the
other poor explanation rebook apologies
I'm quite fast at braiding but this is
in Ex fast motion basically okay so I
take the braid round and I use a pin to
basically and keep it nice and lodged
into place
and basically I do the same thing on the
other side but you don't have to if you
just wanted to do one side then you
probably could so I'm done with the
basic look and now I'm going to do it up
with some herrings
so the herrings are really easy to kind
of use you just pull them apart put them
in the location you want to put them and
let you just squeeze them shut and
that's literally all it takes to do it
and don't know if it gets a bit messy
you know you can just readjust them and
try and keep them aligned I think that
looks a lot nicer guys that is basically
it easiest hair tutorial ever the little
things can make a big difference to a
hair style so guys I hope you enjoyed
that tutorial thank you for watching I'm
gonna be away on holiday in Spain for a
bit so make sure you check out my other
videos to remain entertained</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
