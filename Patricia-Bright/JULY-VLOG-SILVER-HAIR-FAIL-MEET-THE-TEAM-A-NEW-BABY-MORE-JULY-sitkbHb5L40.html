start doing a bit of a summary vlog on
this channel and I've had a little bit
of a dilemma because obviously I have
enough long channel and you know I'm
meant to vlog on there regularly I don't
block on there regularly and I was like
well why I thought like a vlog on this
channel here and it was just gonna
basically be like a monthly we've had
cuz I do so many things I don't get I'm
not really good at doing the daily vlog
and you guys can always check out that
channel but I was like well I want to
share some of the really cool things
that I do do with you guys like over the
month and usually if it's like a whole
mum then it's usually gonna be better
than like one crappy day basically so I
wanted to basically start doing it on
this channel here and we cut over July
July has been a beautiful month and I'm
just gonna show you all the clips and
stuff but I bought basically over the
month there days where I totally do
nothing and I'm at the office and all
that good stuff but you know I thought
I'd put it together for you guys and the
funny thing my husband gave me a really
cool analogy and some guys will get this
he's like well what's the point in doing
the vlog on this channel when I've got
the vlog channel yet well having a vlog
on this channel is kind of like match of
the day which basically summarizes all
the matches that happened over the
Saturday and then he said that the vlog
Channel is the full-blown matches and
they'll start waffling on and that you
guys enjoy this video
I'm on route to Nando's right now
because it's a Saturday and it's kind of
gray and horrible and I don't feel like
cooking and I'm Nando's will be tasty
right about now so yeah and if you
didn't know
driving is not my forte I think I only
learnt to drive a year ago if that yeah
yeah just over a year ago I was and I
learnt to drive and a bit of a grandma
behind the wheel
I like proper light hold my ball like
that and everything do ya
okay guys well I hope you do the vlog
and I'll catch you I probably catch you
in on those I might vlog a little bit
while I'm and drop myself and then you
can watch this problem okay bad leashes

office do a little work
so I love you want to go to the cash
point and you get my freshness and the
cash point never has my palm notes well
