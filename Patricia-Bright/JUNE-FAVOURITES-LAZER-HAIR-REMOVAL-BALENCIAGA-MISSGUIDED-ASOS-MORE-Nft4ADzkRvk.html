it's not the first of July yet but it's
almost the first of July and I'm
planning on switching things up a lot
going forward hold on I need to check
out my brace because I can't speak
properly seriously okay I'm good I'm
good yeah so it is almost the 1st of
July we are halfway through the year and
I can't believe it and I really want to
switch things up a lot over on my
channel and just in general because you
know what I'm like I get bored very
easily and I kind of decided that I
didn't want to do like the monthly
favorite sing and I want to do like a
monthly haul but I don't want to do
holes anymore I really don't like the
idea and I'll be honest with you I felt
like this for quite a while of buying
like all this stuff and like showing it
and I know that people love love love
horse horses like my most favoritest
most popular videos on my channel and I
really appreciate that you guys enjoy
them but one it's not free and number
two and I know lots of you guys think it
is it's not I buy this stuff myself and
number two I mean I just don't feel like
it's like the best example when it comes
to like a healthy shopping habit so I'm
gonna start having a new in and what I
do now is I do shop I love shopping I
love buying new things I love looking at
what the trends are and stuff but what
I'm gonna do is buy a few key pieces and
share them with you hopefully on a
monthly basis so there won't be like you
know hazel as fast
Hazel's presided over everything like
everything world like it would just be a
little bit more refined so I'm gonna
show you some of the new in that I've
got for this month as well as some of my
absolute favorites for the meantime and
because we are in a new month I've
decided that I'm going to do a giveaway
for every single video that I do this
month and I've got some goodies for you
you need they keep wearing to the end to
see exactly what I've got and all I want
you to do is make sure you'll follow me
on my Instagram repost and tag my
picture that I share today on it the
ground on my snapchat and all that good
stuff so we're gonna get started I've
got some good things for you so the
number one thing I want to show you is
this jumpsuit it is from ASOS
and I am getting ready for the summer
season I've got some amazing holidays
plans I mean not necessarily holidays
they're like short trips and have one
big holiday planned and and I just love
wearing this kind of like striped
blue-and-white thing it just feels so
crews and just so lovely so this is a
gorgeous one piece from ASOS now because
it is the holiday season I have this
piece to wear over my bikinis and stuff
I don't know what it is like nowadays I
don't like just being like oh hey bikini
hey buddy like just just all out there
and stuff so I love getting throws and
like kimonos and stuff that I can wear
over and I saw this one on ASOS and I
thought oh my gosh how gorgeous is it's
very Brown cause very hippy and it's
super cute
I wanted a standout piece for summer and
so I found this matching two-piece which
looks super bright on camera this
matching two-piece from Miss a guy did I
thought it was so cute and I have a
wedding in Italy this weekend or next
weekend and I was like hmm could I wear
this I mean I don't know what do you
guys see wedding appropriate probably
not but I'm not buying anything new for
it but I thought this was just a nice
summer standout piece now this dress
probably counts as a new in but also a
favorite and it's from revolve clothing
now involve is kind of like the a sauce
of America I've heard and they've got
some amazing pieces on the site and
they've got like loads of different
brands and then they've got their own
brands as well and I saw this like mesh
net dress and I absolutely love like
mesh basically as you can see like mesh
is like my favorite thing and I have
this other piece also from revolve
clothing what I like about it is this
really gorgeous crochet cropped swing
top which is super pretty for the summer
after that this new in is a bit of a
pricey piece it is Balenciaga sandals
and I had no intentions necessarily of
buying these I always wanted the
Balenciaga boots that came out last
season I didn't get them and they were
just fabulous and I went into the
match's store and and they had the
sandals and they were amazing and the
guy came up to me he's like there's a
red dot on them I said what does that
mean he's like it's her price I was like
right oh so excited tears of the sandal
these are absolutely fantabulous ly
gorgeous really good leather really good
quality I can't wait to wear them on my
summer trips let's move on to my
favorites for the month as well I'm
going to try and do this super quick
number one it is my hand chain from
Urban Outfitters you guys are probably
seeing this in like every single video
you're probably going to keep seeing it
in every single video because I think
it's a super cute piece and for someone
I don't really like my fingers I think
they're kind of long and witchy but I
feel like it just makes me look prettier
and I also have this chain from Urban
Outfitters to burnish their jewelry is
amazing and they're quite affordable and
they last really long and they don't go
Brown so if you ever want to buy it you
know fro jewelry go there I love it
number two it's got to be a red carpet
manicure and this is basically a similar
to H it is a shootie app at the end of
the day and I was going to the stores to
get my nails done until my nose my nails
are literally dead like torn apart blur
ugly horrible and so I was like no more
acrylics they might get the sheliak in
the stores and then like the lady was
peeling it off with a needle I was like
okay I'm not doing that again
and I just like no I'm going to try and
look after and grow my nails at home so
I have been doing she like at home and I
did the red carpet manicure on my toes
now guys I don't show my toes okay my
toes are not for human consumption
however I was really just feeling myself
and got the red toenails and I felt like
my feet look pretty so if you can get
your toes looking good your feet can
actually be good looking okay after that
it is the Aaron amber mask perfume and I
have had this for probably about 2 or 3
months now but the smell of this is just
pure elegance and beauty it's just so
caught like you see my emotion I'm
getting into it it's so beautiful and it
just lifts the way I feel so next it's
the simple kind to skin makeup wipes and
these are a my seller cleansing wipe and
I don't know how I think me did
something in covered garden and they
ended up getting some freebies where hey
we are love freebies but I used it
before I take off my makeup in the
evening and then I do my skincare
routine it is very gentle you know what
simples like is very very gentle but it
gets everything off I'm loving it
after that it is my velour lashes I
mentioned this in my foundation routine
I now have a coupon code I didn't have a
coupon code before but I do have one now
I'll link it below now these are mink
lashes so if you're not into McMasters
I'm sorry please just ignore this bit
but they're ridiculous like I go for my
$1.99 lashes people about my Ardell from
the corner shop yeah but when I tried
these on I thought okay now now I get it
they're absolutely gorgeous I love the
ones that called doll me up and
something whispies so this is a top i
shadow palette and I don't know if this
is like special edition or something
because I was given this when I went to
IMAX because I did do a meet up at the
store and I cannot tell you how
absolutely drop-dead gorgeous or like
everything could bring tears to eyes and
to be honest my tart is amazing this
stuff is ridiculous and I love it when
it's so pigmented because sometimes I
have trouble with eyeshadows shown up on
my skin let me be real like you know my
eyelids are not like skin but they're
this shows up so much there's so much
depth and so much beauty in this
eyeshadow palette that I'm just like I
feel gorgeous when I wear it so finally
I have this Dove pure care dry oil now
for those of you guys who don't know
dava actually do have a range for hair
care and it's actually very very good so
I don't know this is a sample that I got
but this is the dry or and it kind of
comes out like a gel and it's beautiful
and I use it on my hair extensions if we
didn't know you know the curly hair I
was wearing or the wavy and I was
wearing this is the same hair but I just
straightened it out and then added
looser curls to it so this is heads
probably about three months old and it
straightens out and I am having to
straighten it a little bit more
regularly than
would normally do it to extensions but
I've put this in and I really like the
way it makes my hair feel it doesn't
make it greasy or anything but it makes
it look less like dry and I think it's
just a just basically ended this video
and realized I forgot to say when my
main favourites which is my laser hair
removal for those guys who watch my
vagina waxing horror story you know that
I mentioned that I had been having laser
hair removal I've had two treatments I
am due for my third treatments and why
it's my favorite it's because I've
realized I've not I have not had to
shave I do not have any ingrown hairs
and my arms just full root my armpits
feel really really good they're not
pretty yeah yeah I need a little bit
bleach off all up in those because
they're a bit discolored but I must say
they've come on leaps and leaps leaps
and bounds and I really am enjoying the
treatment and for those of you who's
worried about like the pain or if it
hurts it really doesn't hurt that much
it's like done really really quickly
jump it is only a very small area so
within like 2 minutes or 3 minutes
you're done on each arm I'm doing my
treatment at the Skin Clinic I'm having
it in a hole but their Skin Clinic all
around the UK I'm sure there's lots of
places you can do it you do have to be a
bit careful on darker skin tones but
I've done a blog post on it so make sure
you check out my blog it's Patricia
bright code at UK yeah I'm having my
armpits done and my vajayjay done as
well I've only had one treatment like
hasn't been as amazing as all my armpits
like I'd done it twice on my armpits and
I'll eat you for like I'm never gonna
have hair there again hey the treatments
are expensive and they are almost
permanent so I think that they're quite
good and yeah honestly if you can wax or
epilate this is a breeze I feel like
people are really scared about the
lasers but it just feels like kind of
like hot and so they blow you with cold
air so if they have good cold air then
you're not gonna feel anything at all
like you won't know when it's happening
and it's done so so greatly so yeah
laser hair removal so that is it
basically I've showed you all my
favourite and my new ends so I'm gonna
be doing a giveaway in every single
video for the month of July I'm so
excited and I really just wanted to give
back because I felt like I've grown so
much and
just haven't necessarily been able to do
these giveaways for a long time because
it can be a bit complicated and stuff
like that but we're just gonna make this
easy okay all I want you to do is follow
me on Instagram I don't know why I have
an American accent and just tag me make
sure you'll follow me on my snapchat and
give this video a thumbs up and that's
basically it people let me show you what
I've got so number one I have the amber
musk for one of you guys it is the body
cream which is supposed exactly like the
perfume it is absolutely beautiful I
also have a Tarte palette for you guys I
also have an ollie won't trip nail
polish this is literally like the
sexiest thing to put on as a topcoat and
seeing as I've been talking about having
dead out now this is beautiful and

blush I was like this is a really nice
product I really like it so I'm gonna
