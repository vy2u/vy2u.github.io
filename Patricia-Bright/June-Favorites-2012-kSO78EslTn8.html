favorite to June I don't always do
favorite videos but i thought to myself
I'm gonna do ugh they do have a lot of
favorites all of a sudden I'm going to
start off with just a few like make a
few bits nothing special but one is my
my select cover-up by Mac now I think
this is about 11 pounds or something
like that and i use it in an NW 45 and I
don't wear like a lot of foundational
makeup outside of YouTube basically but
I have been putting this on for work and
stuff just here and there and under my
eyes and it's a really nice and light
concealer for those of you who don't
wear foundation or it's a bit too hot to
wear foundation I found that this is an
amazing tight of nice concealer to kind
of make your face look a little bit more
glowy and even definitely worth it so
okay this is what you guys asked me
about all the time the blue eyeliner
that I usually wear I'm not wearing it
today but this is really really kind
common to let my most requested item
basically so this is from the makeup
academy this is intense color and it's
an eyeliner in royal blue i bought this
from superdrug which is basically a
drugs drugs all I did is the drugstore
type thing and it was one pound really
really good though really really strong
blue you've seen it many times on how
strong blue it comes out and love it
it's a favorite and I think it just
gives my eyes that pop just something a
bit different and doesn't look granny so
again you asked me a lot what am i
wearing on my lips and this is a
favorite I probably wear it every single
day and it's a it's a lip liner and I
learnt this from andreaschoice actually
because she was saying that she usually
only wears lip liners with some bomb
over it and I started doing that and I
found its really really nice if you
don't want to be buying lots and lots of
lipsticks you could wear lip liners they
work just as well and actually stay on
quite longer so this is a liner from
sleek and it
you lala liner in red sky night and it's
in three to four i sometimes wear ballot
barium color over it but this is what
I'm wearing now I'm usually which I got
some eyelashes from Miss outlet calm and
I did a whole video with it and the
eyelashes are absolutely amazing the
bands are really thin like as as it
should be because I bought some lashes
online before and the band are really
really thick or poorly made they can't
be curved to your iris or I think for
the price of one dollar 79 you can't go
out if it was me I would i would spend
like 20 pounds worth or lashes maybe the
shipping will be about five pounds or
something it's worth it because I low
lashes are five pounds if not six pounds
and my favorites are the ones that are
kind of like this they look really long
and they look really natural but Rhett
you've got really long lashes because
it's not really thick they're not the
ones I'm wearing now but this is the
number 68 in the butterfly and also the
ones I'm wearing now I'll kind of Oh
what's the other pin it's a 77 47 m and
these are kind of like a fluffy furry
type lash but not really really thick
and it gives you more of a fluttery
eyelashes look which is what I'm wearing
now and I really like these ones and
then one dollar 79 so you can't complain
if you're based in the states i think
it's actually free shipping i come on so
on to hair I just want to talk about two
products and the thing is is obviously I
wear hair extensions what I do wear out
my hair the honesty the majority of the
time so like at work and stuff like that
but I have very dry hair my hair is
chemically relaxed chemically straighten
but it can get very very dry it's always
been quite like that so I do need to
wash it a lot and I do need to use a lot
of oils on it and I found like a wash in
the mind user a light oil and I've
recently started using castor oil and
this isn't all I used to use in the past
but I stopped using it but I started
using it again and it's amazing I really
felt like my hair doesn't feel dry off
there at three days after washing it or
something it feels really really
good really really shiny obviously it
will be quite shiny but after using this
I have to shampoo my hair like once a
week or something just to make sure it's
not really good last month's GlossyBox I
received this beaver oil and it's a hair
treatment with our google now to be
honest I don't fit in is very much argan
oil in it but it is a nice ceram type
treatment basically I know it's got a
lot of silicones in it so you do need to
use shampoo but if you want your hair to
feel kind of silky and really really
sleep this stuff will work if your
conclusion or you have European hair you
could definitely use this this is great
on hair extensions but on the yen's just
to make sure they don't dry out and
lovely this stuff was will be really
good but you need to shampoo the
silicones out otherwise it will build up
on your terms of my cleansing routine do
you guys want to see my hygiene routine
I've seen a few of those videos they're
a bit much but I think their knives do
you want to see one of like my hygiene
routine if you do leave a comment below
and I will do that but i want to show
like a product that i've been loving and
i must thank you thank my husband for
picking this he picked up this shower
gel and it's the original source shower
gel and it's in the mint and tea tree
and it's got essential oils and
everything in it and i absolutely love
this when you go in the shower and you
use that you feel like invigorated i
feel that there's definitely a high
concentration of essential oils in here
it smells so good so minty so teach me
so fresh like you feel like tingly when
you come out I love this stuff I'm gonna
definitely try their stuff in like lemon
and I think they've got some other stuff
as well if it's as good as this mint one
oh my gosh of me and guys I will
continue to I'm not going to get any
more actually but the skin cleanse is
just the bomb diggity min it is so good
and for those who are it's the vitamin
rich cleanser for oily skin I love this
this is basically the holy grail for my
skin I do it every other day or two days
in between or when I just feel like my
skin means just a bit of research
forcing this is the one my sister's
started using it and she has got maybe a
bit more problematic skin than me and
I've definitely seen a big different the
next to item grant beauty or anything
but it's basically the secret so I've
been watching dulce candy and I know
she's kept talking about the magic the
magic and then a few other blogs I had
been watching what reading and stuff
we're talking about it but I knew that
it came from this original book called
the secret so I picked up this book and
I've heard about in the past and I was a
bit skeptical but I tried to basically
take it from a different perspective and
read and see what I think about it and I
really enjoyed this book it is for me
personally there's just a lot of
biblical principles that are ready in
there but sometimes people need a
reminder on how to actually put certain
things in practice and I think in
practicing these things your life could
definitely change and I've seen an
amazing changes in my life by applying
these principles before reading this
book so yeah I like the reminder I
really do like it I wouldn't necessarily
recommend anybody go out and buy it I
wouldn't recommend it now because the
principles are very simple but you know
I could do a video or something on it on
the wrong channel yeah and finally my
favorite if you guys follow me on
Twitter or you follow me on Facebook or
Instagram you know I have an obsession
with two food items one of these is
popcorn I consume or we consume a bag of
popcorn a day that popcorn is the one
like we've now moved on to just Brian
kernels because the amount we consume is
very fairly copious but my next thing is
twister tell me you guys know about the
twister these are popsicles as Americans
might say or isolated as I say Twista is
the best I slowly ever hands down nobody
can tell me anything and the mini
twisters have got like the alternative
colors and stuff and then the Reds on
the outside in the greens on the inside
I have about three of these a day and
let me tell you what's even more amazing
they're only 45 calories
they're actually nothing because it's
mainly water with some sugar but you
know they're really help Lee is that
everyone must ride tourister yeah not
true but they are you know they're not
bad basically this is my guilty pleasure
and one time actually I was like I I
take them on my way to work and it's
saving the clock in the warden that's
how deep it is and I was licking one
luck on the way like don't know I street
and it fell on the full</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
