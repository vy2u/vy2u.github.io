favorite for June I don't always do
favorite videos but I thought to myself
I'm gonna do ugh they do have a lot of
favorites all of a sudden I'm gonna
start off with just a few like make a
few bits nothing special but one is my
my select cover up by Mac now I think
this is about 11 pounds or something
like that and I use it in an NW 45 and I
don't wear like a lot of foundational
makeup outside of YouTube basically but
I have been putting this on for work and
stuff just here and there and under my
eyes and it's a really nice and light
concealer for those of you who don't
wear foundation or it's a bit too hot to
wear foundation I found that this is an
amazing type of nice concealer to kind
of make your face look a little bit more
glowy and even definitely worth it so
okay this is what you guys asked me
about all the time the blue eyeliner
that I usually wear I'm not wearing it
today
but this is really really kind of common
to like my most requested item basically
so this is from the makeup Academy and
it's this intense color and it's an
eyeliner in royal blue I bought this
from superdrug which is basically a
drugstore saw I did it's the drugstore
type thing and it was one pound it was
really really good though really really
strong blue you've seen it many times on
how strong blue it comes out and nothing
it's a favorite and I think it just
gives my eyes that pop just something a
bit different and doesn't look granny so
again you asked me a lot what am I
wearing on my lips and this is a
favorite I probably wear it every single
day and it's a it's a lip liner and I
learnt this from andreaschoice actually
because she was saying that she usually
only wears lip liners with some balm
over it and I started doing that and I
found it's really really nice if you
don't want to be buying lots and lots of
lipsticks you could wear lip liners they
work just as well and actually stay on
quite longer so this is a liner from
sleek and it's an you Lara liner in red
sky night
it's in three to four I sometimes wear a
ballot barium color over it but this is
what I'm wearing now I'm usually but I
got some eyelashes from Miss outlet
dot-com and I did a whole video with it
and the eyelashes are absolutely amazing
the bands are really thin like as as
they should be because I bought some
lashes on mine before and the band are
really really thick or poorly made they
can't be curved to your iris or I think
for the price of one dollar 79 you can't
go out if it was me I would I would
spend my twenty pounds worth on lashes
maybe the shipping would be about five
pounds or something it's worth it
because I know lashes are five pounds if
not six pounds and my favorites are the
ones that are kind of like this they
look really long and they look really
natural but Verret you've got really
long lashes because it's not really
thick they're not the ones I'm wearing
now but this is the number 68 in the
butterfly and also the ones I'm wearing
now are kind of oh let's the other pair
it's a 7 7 4 7 m and these are kind of
like a fluffy fur we type lash but not
really really thick and it gives you
more of a fluttery eyelash look which is
what I'm wearing now and I really like
these ones and then one dollar 79 so you
can't complain if you're based in the
States I think it's actually free
shipping I come on so onto hair I just
want to talk about two products and the
thing is is obviously I wear hair
extensions but I do wear out my hair
look honestly the majority of the time
so like at work and stuff like that but
I have very dry hair my hair is
chemically relaxed chemically straighten
but it can get very very dry it's always
been quite like that so I do need to
wash it a lot and I do need to use a lot
of oils on it and I found that I wash it
in the mind user and light oil and I've
recently started using castor oil and
this isn't oil I used to use in the past
but I stopped using it but I've started
using it again and it's amazing I really
felt like my hair it doesn't feel dry
off there were at three days after
washing it or something it feels really
really good really really shiny
obviously it will be quite shiny but
after using this I
after shampoo my hair but once a week or
something just to make sure it's not
really good last month's glossy box I
received this beaver oil and it's a hair
treatment with alcohol not to be honest
I don't fitness very much
argan oil in it but it is a nice serum
treatment basically I know it's got a
lot of silicones in it
so you do need to use shampoo but if you
want your hair to feel kind of silky and
really really sleek this stuff will work
if you're Caucasian or you have European
hair you could definitely use this this
is great on hair extensions but on the
ends just to make sure they don't dry
out and lovely this stuff was will be
really good but you need to shampoo the
silicones out otherwise it will build up
on yours in terms of my cleansing
routine do you guys want to see my
hygiene routine I've seen a few of those
videos they're a bit much but I think
they're nice do you want to see one of
like my hygiene routine if you do leave
a comment below and I will do that but I
want to show like a product that I've
been loving and I must thank you thank
my husband for picking us he picked up
this shower gel and it's the original
source shower gel and it's in the mint
and tea tree and it's got essential oils
and everything in it and I absolutely
love this when you go in the shower and
you use this you feel like invigorated I
feel that there's definitely a high
concentration of essential oils in here
it smells so good so minty so teach me
so fresh like you feel like tingly when
you come out I love this stuff I'm gonna
definitely try this stuff in like lemon
and I think they've got some other stuff
as well if it's as good as this mint one
oh my gosh of me and guys I will
continue to I'm not going to quite
anymore actually but the skin cleanse is
just the bomb nicotine in it is so good
and for those who are it's the vitamin
rich cleanser for oily skin I love this
this is basically the holy grail for my
skin I do it every other day or two days
in between or when I just feel like my
skin means just a bit of resurfacing
this is the one my sister started using
it and
she has got maybe a bit more problematic
skin than me and I've definitely seen a
big different the next - I don't want
Beauty or anything but it's basically
the secret so I've been watching Dulce
candy and I know she's kept talking
about the magic the magic and then a few
other blogs I had been watching what
really the stuff we're talking about it
but I knew that it came from this
original book called the secret so I
picked up this book and I've heard about
in the past and I was a bit skeptical
but I tried to basically take it from a
different perspective and read and see
what I think about it and I really
enjoyed this book it is for me
personally there's just a lot of
biblical principles that are ready in
there but sometimes people need a
reminder on how to actually put certain
things in practice and I think in
practicing these things your life could
definitely change and I've seen amazing
changes in my life by applying these
principles before reading this book so
yeah I like the reminder I really do
like it
I wouldn't necessarily recommend anybody
go out and buy it I wouldn't recommend
it no because the principles are very
simple but you know I could do a video
or something on my channel yes and
finally my favorite if you guys follow
me on Twitter or you follow me on
Facebook or Instagram you know I have an
obsession with two food items one of
these is popcorn I consume or we consume
a bag of popcorn a day that popcorn is
the one like we've now moved on to just
brighten kernels because the amount we
consume is very fairly copious but my
next thing is twister tell me you guys
know about the twister these are
popsicles as Americans might say or ISIL
Early's as I say twister is the best ice
lollies ever hands down nobody can tell
me anything and the mini twisters have
got like the alternative colors and
stuff as in the Reds on the outside in
the Greens on the inside I have about
three of these a day and let me tell you
what's even more amazing there are only
45 calories there actually nothing
mainly water with some sugar but you
know they're really healthy is that
everyone must try Tourister yeah not
true but they are you know they're not
bad basically this is my guilty pleasure
and one time actually I was like I I
take them on my way to work them it's
saving the clock in the morning that's
how deep it is and I was licking one
like on the way like do my street and it
fell on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
