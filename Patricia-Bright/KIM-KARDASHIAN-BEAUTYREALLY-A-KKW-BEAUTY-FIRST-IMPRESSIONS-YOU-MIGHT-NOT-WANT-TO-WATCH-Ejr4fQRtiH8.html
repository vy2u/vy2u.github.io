open okay before okay people
so some of you guys either love the
Kardashians or some of you guys actually
hate the Kardashian and when it comes to
the product it's exactly the same there
by the love of this over hate and
obviously Kim is about to drop if you
haven't got already her new cream
contour and hierarchy and if I could
completely honest with you I was not
willing to spend a single coin and or a
single penny on any of Kylie via kit
because I would never huge Chinese flat
fan I was a much bigger fan of Kim but I
was never like any we need to buy their
products I was just not that kind of
girl however when kinda came out with
the kit with Kim I was like I'm gonna
embed and put some money and try it out
right so we have the Kim kardashian-west
and these are the nude and lippies right
now the thing is I'm slightly late on
this one because I'm telling you it
takes about 14 million years for any of
these products to arrive in England
literally about four weeks before I got
this I don't know what happened it kind
of like how fun I've got it and then I
saw all these people I don't think they
loved it like Jackson Hale and then some
people like this is awful and I think
I've spent my hard on these okay but I
want to be in the camp of you know what
let me make it work okay sometimes
you've got to make it work and I feel
like it's really the women of color we
were making things work for a long long
time so I'm going to try these on and
then give them a review and I feel like
these are the net if I can make these
work I'm thinking I will put some money
down I'll get myself some of the contour
kits from Kim as well and I heard that a
minute this one is about to make 14 of
million dollars I'm kind of crazy it's
kind of crazy I really hope that the
products are not subpar and I'm not
going to sit here and be like these are
awful oh my god I hate this so long like
not every color is going to work for you
and if it isn't working for you you're
going to make it work and if you can't
make it work spend your money elsewhere
so
from villages so I'll be honest with you
Packaging is bomb this is very kin like
new pastures it's very Kim and I really
love this kind of shade as well my
favorite lip color for many years of
babysit pink actually that was the kind
of pink that I went for but I kind of
grew up out of that so look I'm going to
go in first is the Kimberly but I'm
presuming this is has come since
favorite Anna color and it's looking you
know what I've worn a sheer I've
actually worn a she are by let's go in
okay
these are not a liquid lip they're more
the cream they need layers to look good
so you can see for yourself that these
are giving me a slightly unwell
slightly to tell you know fits my face
in cocaine lips I don't know if anyone
does that but yeah that's we're kind of
looking like and this is the lightest
shade so it's kind of done it look kind
of crazy let's be honest with you this
is the one thing I find when I go to
certain makeup artists when you have
lips like mine one they like quite large
one that I don't have much definition
you never take a light color all the way
around the knit it just looks stupid
what you need to do is reduce reduce the
amount of color on the outside and
define it with a nice dark color so
let's just go I'm surprised at how easy
it comes off so all you basically need
are some dark brown lip liners hello
honey I am going to go in with this
liner from bareMinerals this is from
their Jen nude what is this color I
don't know what this color is called but
it's a beautiful pretty Brown
I already feel like it's going to look
better and then we're going to go back
in with Kimberly and just focus on the
middle part so I know people have a lot
to say about the color the color isn't
what's bothering me what is bothering me
is how thin it is you really need to add
layers and there you go
I don't know how does that looks on
camera but in real life that actually
looks kind of cute now it took a lot of
work to get here and I feel like you can
see the creases underneath my lips well
overall if I spent my money and this is
all I need to do I will roll with it
it's pretty actually like you doing akin
yet
do I look like you yet so honestly I
feel like every woman can make a product
work for them if they know how to work
on it for things like shade enhancing
drops
lip liners and I'm not saying it's
excusable for brands or companies to not
have everything that they need for a
person however sometimes not everything
is going to work on everyone and if
someone isn't going to cater to you find
other brand to actually do and take your
money with you okay and invest in those
who are investing in yourself or for
what is good for you next shade is Kiki
so I'm going to vary way that these are
all like kind of named for her that's
very weird
okay so Kiki more of a pink god
literally putting chalky paste on your
lips
good so this is a bit more of a pink
again it's the same thing when it comes
to the formulation slightly spin up like
this nice and creamy it feels nice on my
lips and too then if another huge fan of
liquid lipsticks anyway so if you the
ones that dry your lips out to kind of
say there and be hard but yeah so this
is bit more of a pink and as you can see
my liner actually looks okay what I'm
going to do is go in with bittersweet
again and create some definition honey's
right now I think that was Brian I don't
know if you guys can see those I could
get into my creases add a little bit
more to see that do you see that a skew
I really like it but again I found that
kind of car as I said I used to love a
baby pink like a purple liner that was
me for a very long time so yeah this
that you know isn't too far off why I
used to wear and kind of like a more
modern take from it I like it and I
actually like the way it feels and it
comes up like my lips don't feel like
crap basically the next shade is called
kin boom creating this one yo and every
time I put them on they have this kind
of shock factors right oh gosh should be
honest most of them look exactly the
same
this one has a bit more the probably
hint to it just literally look like the
exact same shade because that you could
just probably buy one but I'm going to
be creative and I'm going to switch up
I'm going to use V note which is quite a
nice dark purple
so that's that Fitness being a lipliner
and it's completely taking it away from
like the kind of new dnews and make it a
bit more of a pinky which i think is
kind of cute our point in being creative
with makeup you kind of make and what
you want to make for yourself it doesn't
look like what it would have looked like
but I was getting a bit bored of them
all looking literally exactly the same
okay
back to neutral and I'm going in the
final color called Kimi di sweat every
name is n cube GG Kimberly Kim and Kimmy
I got it Kimmy I prefer this one I feel
like this one is the most richest in
color and the one that's what we need
the least work
this is more like a dark coral on the
spectrum of ashy dark I keep doing that
face that face like that mean that like
therefore you face so we're going to go
in with this bareMinerals light Lionel
I swear Shakur this video hashtag the
power of - the power of lioness Bassam
I'm going to stop there you go
look at that that is super cute it's
where it goes beautifully look at this
at the top if she goes beautifully with
this orange top I love it I've made it
work for myself on its own this was
looking right no it was looking all
kinds of wrong but within like the right
line up I think it looks good so overall
my opinion is of bees is that I actually
kind of liked them because I do like
pastors and news however these for me
with my lips and my tone neither line
them like 400 percent sure hundreds are
hundred percent sure and I actually
think the colors are really cute
actually
and dose to finish a bit of cake you
need to layer it up and it's coming up
put on me a little bit more like a gloss
as it's more of a cream and it's been
nice if it was a little bit matter but I
don't hate them the color Kimberly that
one can just that was taken the long
shot into the bin and but this color is
um Kimmy really nice I also like um Kim
as well and Kiki plant a bit a sheet as
well but overall I feel like you know I
like it I like the packaging and I like
how I look and obviously I feel like I
thought it is a Kardashian Empire you
know in my home now so yeah that is my
take
somewhere else there are plenty other
lipstick places you could put your money
in first whether I be buying the contour
kit after this moment I'll be honest
with you I will shop and I'm telling it
taking me a you know a suspense any
dollar on on the Kardashian clan so that
says audible alright first guys I hope

it honest and real with you guys if
