video is going to be a really quick
makeup look I'm going to show you how I
get this what I'm going to call the Kim
Kardashian glow which is really
definitely a technique to kind of
achieve this look I hope I've achieved
it I'm not one for makeup what I makeup
and stuff like that if I'm definitely
one who is in love with flawless skin
and it does start with having a great
basis but if you'd like to see my
skincare like routine or treatments I'm
doing at the moment they leave a comment
below I will show you I do that anywho
I'm blabbing I hope you enjoy this
tutorial hi guys so starting off with
the foundation I usually mix two
different colors together to get my
ideal color and I put these on my darker
spots
sorry I'm gonna be singing all the way
through this forgive me then use a
kabuki brush to blend it all in really
really well and just make sure that my
skin looks nice and even and glowy I
find I've got dark areas on my head and
around my face the biggest step is the
concealing you want to use a concealer
that's two or three shades lighter than
your skin tone and keep that under your
eye area and lightly blend that in
you really want to keep the color of the
lighter concealer
then use my kabuki brush again to make
sure that there's no harsh lines between
my two different foundations I also
conceal all my nose and my forehead area
so you can sit in high life with a nice
and translucent powder or a highlighting
powder
i'm using asleep blush as always to
contour and a nude lip this is so easy
to do you guys
I'm done hope you enjoy thanks for
watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
