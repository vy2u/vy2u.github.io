that I now have short hair so yes it's
very different to me but you guys know I
love to like look kind of Beadle
bodacious and cute stuff and you can
still do it with short hair you know I'm
sure there's more of an elegant
hairstyle for me
but I can definitely work with it so I'm
going to show you how I create extra
nice bodacious curls kind of Kim K curls
even on a short hairdo so as you can see
my hair's kind of asymmetric this side
is longer than that side and this is
because this hair is more or less meant
to be worn across the face but um I'm
not going to be doing that for now maybe
I'll go back to own across the face I'll
show you how I just do colors in it with
um hair straighteners it's really easy
to do so all you need is just a brush
and some thin hair straighteners smooth
the hair straight was the better I know
what Andrea is talking about where she
says that so what you want to do is just
take a piece of hair and you wanna turn
it just want to smooth down I kind of
turn your
at the same time
and the more random the better and if
you do it on the bottom layer then it's
going to have more volume so it'll go
really big like that if you don't in the
top layer then it makes it look like
you've just got nice neat clothes
without too much volume
this is my front bone that I'd like to
be certain way
just a flirt that makes you feel like
that which is how I like just that part
to be any straight bitch you can just
color
so I just got really big sections could
you really don't want spiral cars in
short hair
I just mess it up
so now you can see tell the difference
between that side and that side okay
guys so that is it this is how I achieve
Kim K COEs on the short hairs I heard
she liked that video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
