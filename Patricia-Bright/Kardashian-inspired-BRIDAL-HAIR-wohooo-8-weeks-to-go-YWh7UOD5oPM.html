video is going to be to talk i'm looking
at a lot of pictures of kim kardashian
and she's got loads of pictures right
now we've kind of i think it's a perfume
shoot something I love the wave and it
was ideal and I'm really thinking of
what kind of style i want for my bridal
hair and i think i wanted a side part or
to the side of this kind of way so this
video it's just a tutorial on how I
achieve this kind of loose loose loose
loose connected way I did make one
mistake in that I cold and outwards on
this side and I curled in words on this
side my advice would be to call out word
on both sides I know guys I hoped you
enjoyed you enjoyed this tutorial and
I'll see you later I so I started from
applying heat protectant through my hair
I then use some mousse which will help
me with the kind of holding and that's
literally just as I don't have holding
spray and then brush through my hair get
out any kinks so with my curling Tong I
use it as a curling wand and grab a
section of my hair and wrap the hair
around
and lovely curl so the really important
thing you need to do is to wrap your
hair all in the same direction because
when you come to brush it out that's how
you'll get the hair to all stick
together so I kind of look a little bit
like Shirley Temple with these colors so
I don't want that I'm just gonna break
these out with my fingers and just get a
loose wave and then I brush them out you
can see they all start sticking together
and it gives you that really nice wavy
effect
I love this brush which i bought from
boots it's just the best brush in the
world I just add a bit more holding
butter to it and just use my fingers to
start that's it hope you enjoy this
tutorial it is super quick and super
easy thanks for watching bye it's going
to be part of the actual footage you
don't know Michael new haircut now
they've done whenever you should show
the Maureen to meet a non nails look
guys it's what I do my family in Roy
we've an ok ok I'm going as he just gone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
