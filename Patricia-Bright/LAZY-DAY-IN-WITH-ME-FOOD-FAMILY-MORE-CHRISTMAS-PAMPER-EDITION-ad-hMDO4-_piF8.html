favorite times of the year so I've got a
lazy day in with me just during the
festive period so I hope you guys enjoy
so this time of year I usually wake up a
lot more peppy and I love to put on some
Christmas music I love pentatonix and
just you know the traditional carols I
don't know there's something about them
that make you feel good and give me some
extra spring in the morning and then I
go ahead and do a little bit of a
workout I love using YouTube to workout
so anything from Pilates but I also do
Fitness blender as well and it kind of
just I don't know limbers me up for the
day so I do like just stretching
volantes
weights anything that's gonna keep me
nice and fit
after that I can go ahead and pamper
myself after I get my sweat on so I
usually like a candle get some up
bubbles and everything going in the bath
and while I do that I'll go ahead and do
like a facial treatment after that I
like to have a deep but a gentle cleanse
I am using a liquid facial wash from
Clinique and I'm also using the Clinique
sonic system as well which is a
purifying cleansing brush it's got super
soft bristles but it's really great for
like exfoliating it kind of rotates
oscillates to really just cleanse out my
pores but it's very very gentle and it's
great if you have maybe a bit more
sensitive skin but it's kind of like
giving myself a facial treatment before
I go ahead and just soak it up in the
bath so after that I'd go ahead and get
ready for the day I go ahead and do a
facial treatments and clarifying and
moisturizing and then I go ahead and put
my makeup on because I don't know
sometimes when I put my makeup on I
really feel like I'm a fresh for the day
so if you've been watching me for long
enough you know that food is my number
one priority and the girls are coming
around and I'm making healthy ish snacks
and doing fruit kabobs which I love but
I'm really lazy so I basically just buy
the cottage chop chop through not as
nice as just chopping up fresh fruit but
it's a really nice snack where say some
yogurt awesome ice cream so I've invited
my sister and my cousin around and I'm
plying them with treats before I get
them working
I love basically getting everyone
together to help me with the Christmas
tree I have an electric tree that you
meant to plug in the struggle was really
real and I had to actually get the
instructions out to do this but it's
just fun getting everyone together while
we basically get it all Christmassy in
the house
now before getting them to wrap up my
presence I've got my sister a little
present I've actually got her the
Clinique sonic system as well and this
is a special Christmas one that was sent
to me to give her it's also got the
3-step system in it so I'm going to give
that to her before I make her do all the
hard work for me and as you can see she
was a very pleased we basically then
spent the evening rapping watching films
and just having a lovely time
that's a Christmassy lazy day for me I
hope you guys enjoy it make sure you
check out my last videos and I will see
you guys later
