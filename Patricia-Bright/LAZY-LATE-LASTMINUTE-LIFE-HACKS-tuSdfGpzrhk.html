again I know I told you it's going to
change every outward just get just get
ready alright and but today's video is
going to be a life hack video for the
glands that are always lazy late or
last-minute calm I'm not going to lie I
put my hand up
that is me to achieve like I am one of
these people I'm always panting and
running out of the house and missing the
trades I am that woman who like me sweat
on my brow one eyebrow a little at food
but I was like you know what this year
I'm not doing that this year
I'm going to be that girl who is always
on point even if I'm doing stuff a last
minute and and what you're going to need
this video a thumbs up because you know
if you were late to be in that girl
who's a bit lazy last minute or just
late then I need to know that it's not
just for me so I'm going to share with
you some of my favorite hacks like that
it's actually about to transform my
actual life this year because I'm not
going to be the same so guys I hope you
enjoyed this video so number one and
they say well for plan plan to fail yes
that's what they say and I like to have
a diary with time boxes in the night
before and I think when you are someone
especially if you want to wake up early
if you are somebody who the night before
you get really excited about the
different things that you've got to do
the next day you'll be up and alert and
ready so when you have a diary visit
sometime boxes in there it kind of kind
of put the wind up your backside it's
going to make a huge difference to your
productivity and you're less likely to
be late or last-minute number two I love
this one it's to have a place to get
ready to having a track assigned to like
a role so like the six minute shower and
you find two tracks that you know what
an hour six minutes long if you have you
know a certain album that you do all the
work to but sending it set in a playlist
track that is like half an hour long
which is basically the amount of time
you have to get ready to makes a huge
difference so for those of you
so I'm rushing maybe for a hot day maybe
where as planned as you needed to beat
maybe down there is not looking as fresh
as you want it to look and you're going
to have to shave a really good thing to
do is to basically you know you're going
to have to shave but choose to shave
with conditioner because it is going to
make it smoother and silky and you're
less likely to get up and have a cold
flannel ready to like wash up down below
when you get out this is going to help
you seal up your pores and to prevent
you getting a razor bumps down the load
because there's nothing like shaving and
then you're walking down the street and
you're like you know just scratching
your crotch it's not going to be a great
look one of the number one reason why
people only is basically distraction we
are live in a world where there are
ping-pong things everywhere we got 14
emails coming in you know your mum
sending you whatsapp messages of those
and one of the things I actually love
and I find is a lifesaver is actually an
inbox pause are and I will show you the
inbox pauses that I use and basically
what it means is that I received no
emails for a period of time and then I
can set a time in the day where all my
emails come in and I can check them for
someone who works on my laptop and I
find that I always go back to my inbox
I'm always looking for something to
distract me but when I've got the inbox
pause on there are no emails that are in
my inbox and they're clear
and I can set up at 3 o'clock or 4
o'clock in the afternoon to answer all
my emails at one time in the similar
Fred again distraction it is not that if
you're in the furniture once that's your
Facebook you get all these messages
permanently coming at your face
constantly just annoying you and nothing
that you can do is put all your apps are
basically go to ping or notify it into
one folder and put them onto your back
page on your phone so that you can't see
them you can set an alarm or time to
basically check that folder and need for
your notifications only at one time for
the next way for those of you who are
always rushing is to have a uniform no
not a school uniform I used to wear
school uniform to school but a uniform
which is basically a particular style or
pieces that you wear every single day of
the week so you don't even have to think
about get a dress I like to have a
railer basically jumpers and jeans that
is what I'm wearing the jogger jeans
jacket black cream white grey and I
realized that I just had to simplify my
cell because thinking about how I'm
going to pair my floral top with my
peplum a line striped skirt and my shoe
wise and boots and I do that it's way
too much information right about now
hold your fantasy dressing till the
weekend or a special occasion but
uniforming is a great way to simplify
your life and to usual time effectively
so for all my makeup loving ladies who
wear makeup every single day having to
makeup bags is going to set you up for
success I have to make up I mean I've
got a makeup collection and then I have
a makeup bag that I basically throw it
into my cries you guys follow me on my
social you'll see that I often put in
our whole face like I'll be on the train
like I can do a beat in 20 minutes a
from my house to Waterloo just having a
set bag of all the key things you need
in it so like a powder and eyebrow
pencil a lip balm or a lip product and a
bit of concealer and a small eyeshadow
quad having it something like that means
that you know you know what if you can't
get your makeup done in the morning at
least at some point in time you'll be
able to get it ready and the worst thing
is if you're having to like sift through
all your makeup and you can't find
anything and you're mushing and you're
late and your mission tree you don't
want to do that I can tell you that a
lot of my sisters have known this trick
for a long time but not everybody knows
about this doing your hair the night
before hello to in quick time for
straightening and curling and blow
drying like in the morning know whether
you got coming to school of your hair
wet and snow all of that needs to just
stop do your hair the night before
there's really cool styles such as pin
curling or even in writing your hair and
wearing a my sexy little bonnet is going
to make your next day hair look amazing
I wear bonnet like every day like if you
see me I'm permanently in the bond on it
and wearing a bunny is a great way to
just maintain their hair spell Matt
slept on it off in the morning
you're just going to look like a queen
if you are running late to meet someone
or to go somewhere just bring along a
bride something like donut is going to
make everybody forget that you're late
and then you can blame it on the donut
to the reader that you later you were
being special you were treating everyone
good and then you know that's why you're
late
so guys those are some of the Hat I feel
like go to a lake last minute and lady
should definitely know and then put my
hand up and say this with me that's been
my life but you know I'm changing I'm
implementing these and I'm going to
improve my life in 2017 so guys I hope
