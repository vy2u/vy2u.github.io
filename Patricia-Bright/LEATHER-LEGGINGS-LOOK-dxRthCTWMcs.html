a number of different outfits with
leather and velvet trousers so you guys
saw the whole video that I did with the
leather trousers and I also had some
velvet trousers that I didn't show you
but I thought you know what let me just
kind of show you how I would wear them
out and kind of what it looks like so I
hope you like this idea
hi guys I saw I thought I'll show you
how I would wear the leather leggings in
a full outfit look and you could sim run
it with like a sparkly top this is what
I'd wear out kind of still very kind of
futuristic along with the leather which
are kind of reflective like the top I've
learned them with some started wedges
which I bought from next actually I
really like these they're really
comfortable and just really cute as well
you can see those like that and yeah you
can kind of see that outfit all together
and it's kind of hard it's kind of rocky
kind of edgy that's kind of me but it's
not too dressed up okay and also I can
top top the top in and I like that with
this so I'll also show you how I dress
up you know for another kind of night
out also and how I dress it down Fister
cated look with leather leggings kind of
put a nice black blazer on it this has
kind of got power shoulders but you
could put a plain black blazer with it a
white vest I think white vests are
essential you know especially when you
do black and white the whole monochrome
look with red is what I think that's
really cool
and I'm just gonna let those with some
like killer our doe Hills it kind of
just looks kind of elegant at the same
time and that is it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
