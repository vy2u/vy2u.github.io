favorite product and my hair extensions
so let me just break down my hair
extensions I wear weaves hair exceptions
or 3/4 we'se which is what I like to
call them which I stow on the hair I use
you guys know you've heard me mention it
before the hair that I have a wholesale
at full I will be saying this in the
future but there's a website being
developed and it takes a really really
long time
we have sold probably over 300 packs now
since I just mentioned it on YouTube and
I've sold so much of it and it's had a
really really good reception and for
anyone who has used it please leave
comments below because we've not had any
negative feedback but we've only had a
few people or not sure I've had about
20-30 people get back to me Zilla they
really liked it but from the amount that
we've sold you know it doesn't match up
but so with the hair it's kind of got a
kinky texture because I have my hair is
quite kinky and to make sure that it
blends you know you need something that
doesn't look too silky and too shiny and
I don't like I don't like that whole
Indian hair Brazilian hair type stuff I
just don't believe it because because I
know it's so much about her I just
it's an absolute lie and facade and not
that people aren't sending high quality
hair but it's a marketing ploy for one
minute you know Indian head was the best
half in the market then it was Brazilian
hair then it was Peruvian then only
unicorn it's actually that it's just
marketing and all of the hair comes from
the same source for a fact all of these
girls get there from Chinese or Indian
suppliers okay you can tell the
difference between hair because the
Chinese has a lot straighter or
Malaysian heads a lot straighter and has
high density and that how you get really
good ends really good finish really high
quality air Frank the Indian hair you
get more the wave patterns and we can
get the hair that looks a little bit
more not so shiny like the Chinese heads
very very shiny versus the Indy head and
then they just process their I rode by
steaming it or by chemically using rods
to create curls in to create waves for
all of you who are out there and we
still believe that this hair is coming
from Brazil still coming believing this
hair's coming from Peru you know it
blows my mind but I actually do
something like that what I've done the
video before but yeah so I just wear
that hair that blended my hair's and
know that this is getting Malaysian hair
Malaysian hair transcends anything which
has been processed to have a kinky
texture to blend it with my natural hair
and that's what I request and constantly
and that's what I've been selling and
that's what's have amazing amazing
reviews so that's for those of you ask
me all about my hair my sweat work the
color that I wearing Mac I determine NW
45 I use an NC 54 concealing under my
eye and stuff I'm actually using in its
in W 4 to 5
end up in 40 under my eyes right now
because I kind of changed up a little
bit Matt will be my favorite product for
now but guys I'm still at that very
early stage because I'm really not a
makeup artist I am just kind of trying
to work out what looks better than me
what do I like the most
as again I like a more natural finish
for the way that I like to look and I
have quite good skin and I look quite
good without makeup itself and so yeah
but for YouTube is finding their pot
lots and lots of makeup what nips it do
I wish you and you'll find that the new
new lipstick I were is called Jubilee
and by Mac and I wear all the time
although right now we're papaya punch by
see how do I stay in shape boys and
girls I don't do anything and I'm
actually ashamed to say it I have you
know I've told you guys this before but
when I was younger I was actually really
really horribly horribly sinned I used
to have my fellas breakfast Mac doubles
and lunch actually eat so much food
my mum used to take us to the doctors
and is there something wrong with my
kids you might know that perfectly
healthy but we were just really really
slim so I think it's natural to be
quacks to live with us I caught them all
away recently some of you this am i
pregnant I am not pregnant okay I'm not
pregnant and my head looks a lot bigger
because I'm getting away in Christmas I
just getting really big forehead and I
have quite you know chubby cheeks as
well so when I gain weight or like comes
over here so I I'm gonna start you know
working out but I'm probably Anna I hate
working out so I probably just gonna do
right Zumba or salsa dancing
I had guys I have some surprises for you
I'm not even gonna tell you yet so yeah
I'm gonna start salsa dancing and I've
been doing situps every single night
even doing 10 each other but I'm gonna
try and go up and do more self just to
get a nice tone of belly because again
you guys keep thinking I'm credit
no it's actually Jesus fact that I have
a curved cut part and it means that kind
of I have a more prominent behind and
the more prevent stomach as well and
because of the shape of my back so it
happens I was a question I got I would
say it was it's called fantasy by
britney spears it's really bad that i
like like a celebrity perfume but it's
not good and i know anything that's
karamanian like sweets and I feel like
it soldier you can really Elmo that
smell my favorite stores that's what
people ask me is are what would be my
favorite store just because you can get
just that classic European look from
Zara for a decent decent price and I do
like Topshop as well and I got something
really I think it's over a price for
what they're selling over there we
design I don't have one but it's gonna
have to be prayin other than that when
you proto bad and I lit up like I'm a
time person I like understated design
this so I'd like to wear designer but
you'll never see like from the outside
back it's a designer piece but you know
don't much because the bags are the sake
I'm Mary Lou Vuitton bag like I'm
wearing a Gucci bag it's just so garish
for me yeah so any product designer
which is understated is why I like is up
something else I've been asked a lot
about was a travel and money saw a dress
transfers and where I've been to in the
world you guys know I recently went to
Singapore Malaysia Barney I've been to
Italy six times I've been to Portugal
of into Belgium I've been to Nigeria
four times I've been to America twice
I've been to New York and I've been to
this don't ask you I was in Texas I've
been to and in Texas I went to when I go
to Houston and I've been to some place
where Elvis is from Tennessee I stayed
in the game or at home that hotels
amazing amazing hotel but Tennessee like
some random area and yeah that's worth
the trouble I will be go to Mauritius I
would love to go to South Africa
Australia and Fiji now oh my god I'm
drooling think about it I absolutely
love traveling I love like I should have
been an anthropologist because I love
people and I love culture and I love
different languages and I love finding
out what you know other people like
doing and so that's why I really like to
travel and I can't wait to get married
in travel the world people about to me
how do i afford to travel and how do i
you know - any more new stuff well and
I've always been someone who saved a lot
obviously I work a full-time job so I
get a wage and I do make a bit of money
on YouTube it's really not that much
money guys and then the majority of my
money from work and I just I'm really
good in terms of you know with all my
wages I wake sent off and then I
dedicate it to my bills after that
now I dedicate it you know I do I do
give tithes I do get offering and I do
give money out in to those in need so
different charities that stuff like that
and then all of those I see the priority
before buying clothes and stuff for
myself and then so our decided okay I'm
going to split the amount I've got left
between just general spend and then
saving for holidays and fun stuff like
that so that's how I like to manage my
money</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
