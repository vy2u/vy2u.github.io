really might ask this of my I'm not
gonna answer these questions with my um
the questions you guys asked about Mike
Hill odds himself that's how doing me
I'm I said this before but you know I
had a friend at university had an older
brother and he was a friend of the older
brother and kind of I've seen them out
and about before he used to work on the
doors and so used to be about sir you
guys don't know that he's very very like
being like some big fat Nick can use
this when will this I was shaking in the
gym like you so I used to see him on the
doors like when I used to got confidence
stuff like that and one night I think
those after like people someone's
birthday no no no I should tell you
before that so one last year that he
dropped me and my friends home like he's
always after card cool baby grand even
Rogers that we went there and he was
working on the doors next door and he
dropped me my friend actually remembered
us and he told me he thought we were
likes and a bunch of Elliot girls from
London before we go racing which we did
it's true and so we didn't really have
any planted there and then there was a
barbeque and then we all went out
clubbing and stuff and then for those of
you don't know he picked me up and we
were outside the club and there just
loads and loads of people you know you
guys are all trying to see who there
take it home for the night which was not
mean people and not just bad people
Bears know the people around and then he
kind of jumped in the middle picking up
over his shoulder and like you rang rang
with me and said what the hell is this
guy doing
and then my phone's robbed daddy took my
phone if I can I have my phone back
please
he said to me you can have my phone back
if you give me your phone number and my
but I 79 good thing so yeah that's how
we like she didn't even call me who
don't look cool I gonna do something
dramatic like that and then not cool
he text me hahaha and I'm the type of I
like talking you guys are talking so why
would you text me can you quiet Exim
call me and the cookie is he's shy okay
yes so that's how we met how we ever did
together no we never live together so
right now I'm in Mike's house and
Whitewater house in Manchester which is
actually just sold because he's moved to
London so I might show you guys around
but it's empty now and these are
probably the last time I'll ever be here
and we've never have to go low because
we want to get married than they need
each other and just do we just were just
very in traditional cockle where they
and just like to do things and a bit
about our relationship so we met at
University my first year of uni when I
was 19 and he was it was for one
effusion
and so we were here together for three
years and then we ended up being
long-distance because Michael still
lived in Manchester and I had moved down
so we were in a long-distance
relationship for two years that was very
very very difficult we had our ups and
downs during that time and our boy
long-distance is not the one like unless
you guys are sure that you're going to
have a future together and there are
times where is you know touch-and-go
foods if we were don't have a future
together because it was a case of you
know who's going to be where we going to
live what we're going to do and thank
God that you know Mike was the kind of
man who who who was flexible enough to
he's moving to London and you know I
don't know if I could have moved to
Manchester I really just didn't believe
in Manchester at all
I'm very close to my family and they
live down there so but I know what about
what did my parenting when I bought an
English guy home they um well my mum has
been right before and I just had always
a friend and he's been like he's good
he's really good when he met my mom he
was so respectful and obviously African
parents love respect you know and he you
know could hello auntie you know he
didn't stop referring to her by name if
anybody knows you don't refer to Africa
people by their name you just got an
auntie or uncle okay just straight away
in fact auntie very very script can I
help you he helped my mom so much and he
would just go do cancel her that all the
time and I really love that about him
how he would he'd bend over backwards
for my mum and AH something to say
and she loved Batman so she knew here
machines at all my kill my Caminos boy
but she never mean it then it got an
Alberta that you know and then you know
he started coming down to London a lot
more meeting my dad and my dad really
really laid-back he just say hello okay
how's the weather talk about the news
you know this country is going down me
but you know that's one of those night
so he was cool so he never said anything
no one said anything
and Mike's you know very open to my
culture as well and he knows a lot he
knew a lot he just knew you know where
people just know the ways good dinner if
I could talk about African homes like
long time and he just knew straight away
how to be like that and yeah so have I
had I how I dated in interracial
relationships and thought okay I know
Dylan Lewis I'm not dated that much I I
was not the kind of it lots of and but
you know I dated a guy I mind you I've
dated a guy who was you know mixed race
from Barbados and then I did
a guy he was half Pakistan Pakistani and
half English so I was always on his eye
open to just if I like someone I like
someone and I don't care what anybody
else thinks I like something like it
okay and I kind of like me a little bit
different properties I said I don't see
the challenge LOC is anything just you
like him like and I liked my of my metal
that they're very saw their own crude or
something was to do that pushing so what
do my friends think my friends website
or he's really nice to the thing is
where Michael is he is so personable
that you can't help but like him like
even I had I've got some Riddler and
then not all of us just like one or two
people but when they meet Mike they just
like him because he'll just he breaks
down barriers really really cooking he
doesn't care about nobody what you feel
