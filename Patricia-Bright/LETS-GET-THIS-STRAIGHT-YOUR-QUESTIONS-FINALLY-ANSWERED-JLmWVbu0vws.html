about me so I hope you enjoyed and
answer the question it's got more than
over a thousand questions about oh my
gosh how am I going to even do this but
other than were repeats this up like
that so let's get started and just a bit
about me so if some people arts what's
my name
well my name is Patricia and I don't
know one of my youtube name is Britpop
princess right at the time when I
started my on YouTube all right it was
all everyone was American and I like oh
we can just stand there and you know
British so I had great properties but
let's just forget all about
I am 24 going 180 yes I know my granny I
did at home with my mum my dad my sister
and you guys know you hear Maureen
they're not people arts whose mommy
morning my sister and for those of you
we live in London so some of you box
about my origins I am of my junior
heritage so my parent my parents came
over from Nigeria well my mother member
from idea but that came in from a junior
and the New England there me I'm
Nigerian and I from Delta States so
that's the origin she works for my
business Nigeria yes I've been there
plenty time about four or five times but
I've not been in a long time I do plan
on going there this Christmas
so Christmas coming for two thousand
times I hopefully I shall go so in some
box like well I was like when I was
young done what was like growing up and
stuff like that and term just more about
me so at the Charles I was my mom used
to call me strong-willed okay
I've always been very very strong-willed
I've always been very self-assured and
quite a confident and adamant that what
I'm saying is right and that's just why
I was like so at school I was like
everybody's friends and I like
everybody from the Goths to the Turner's
to like the group of Asian girls to like
everyone to the police whatever I just
used to kind of go around and talk to
everybody because I think that's just
who I was I just liked everybody and I
decided that much time who I wanted to
hang around there or who I did I was a
bit disruptive I used to get a ton of a
lot for talking too much and I was
actually traveled you know at school I
did get excluded a few times one of them
was for one of them was for right but
that was in defense of someone who's
being bullied someone was being chased
with water but another group of goodies
and then I stopped the girl from chases
the girl and then we ended up having a
fight because I was trying to be a
captain saving the world and then they
get to me different that and just
getting distracted but teachers like to
me and like I won awards like for the
most flamboyant pair of tights and I was
you know I used to go to the head of
year's office in the morning and collect
all the registers and give them out and
I was a prefect as well so I was quite
good it was just me and my sister in the
house I do have my older brother and my
older sister live in Nigeria and so we
were just like this people used to think
they were twins
we stood tall kept the same well she's
probably won't ever say but we were
extremely like scary it's a bit how
tight we are but you know I love this
she drank Oh friends you guys ought to
me a lot about my friends like I have
about I have three really best like
close friends with their friends with
from college we all were at college and
we just all the same in our own
different ways but we laugh at the same
things we all found the same people say
we sound the same stuff and yeah they're
just not my best friends and they're my
bridesmaids what what may we start doing
a YouTube video as well I kind of came
across them when I thought I was about
looking at hair and then after I started
looking at makeup and I thought oh my
gosh is this really really cool and then
I just really wanted to do it because
everyone was from the states and you
know I just got into it and I never
really took it seriously I was like
uploading as when like once a month or
once every two months and then I decided
I really wanted to take it seriously and
I enjoyed it and you guys don't know
that YouTube is one of the things that
I've actually stopped to that one thing
that have been quite consistent in my
life and all that I've done consistently
in my life might say what about other
than my I think yeah I wish it's all
about food might be it's one thing that
I focused on
it's like YouTube I talked to you guys
this before how I feel about YouTube and
I feel like it's my right we have a lot
of opportunity and that someone who
likes to talk so like it's just an
outlet for me not shimming everybody
else's ear off you know actually with my
involvement
that's know people ask me why are you so
confident and stuff like that I I would
have say no I am confident ass yeah I'm
confident in something I'm very selfish
short I don't care about what the status
quo is doing I've always been something
you've always want something very
different to everybody else and I don't
care if I come across as being odd or
all weed or strategy because what I'm
doing is white and have this belief like
in my head I am right I don't give her
any put me ugly then we're doing it
wrong I could do it right so I have a
lot of self-confidence and that that
wasn't steal from my mum like you know
she would not let us talk bad about
ourselves she might know you guys are
the best
so in that I'm gonna put that into
myself and not confident in the cocky
way because I'm not one of these now I'm
not just beautiful is that oh my god
I'm confident within myself that I don't
have the majority or show off in English
or when you ask me any questions about
my beliefs away I'm confident in what I
stand up so this next section is going
to be about job education and all that
kind of stuff so let me just start off
with my educational equivalent what
people wanted to know what did I do for
gtcys well math English science and I
did history ICT and up to even cares I
got all a to see grades I've got two A's
6 B's and to see so in terms of an
academia I am quite sought Bible was
always quite lazy absolutely hated
acetate studying and I fit not stupid
Apple but you know if for any lessons
learned and anyone who's out there
study study hard it's you know they'll
be over in a flash and graves means so
much in the future you explain yourself
every step of the way so yeah at a level
I did biology love biology absolutely
not biology psychology Business Studies
and I did chemistry but I dropped it and
then I did yeah that was it so yeah did
you say that at 8'o because what I came
along and got in the way again
warning to you
girls are doing what they're always come
and distract you I was distracted and I
went from basically I was a top female
in my biology in terms of grades and I
was a second top person in my biology
class and then you know his lessons were
not what my lessons were so he was on
break from my head lesson oh oh I
stopped going to listen yeah anyway
let's not talk about a print book a bit
so I went to a magister Metropolitan
University and I studied accounting and
Finance but initial awareness but II
studied international fashion marketing
but I dropped that course with if I
realized this I was really bad I
realized what people were passionate and
I was like I'm not no I don't work for
free like I really do care about money
and I do care about how much I earn and
for me it just wasn't it wasn't enough
so perfect
accounting and Finance just because we
have an accounting module and I was just
good and I've got like 80% of I think
that it is oh let me go do a county
completely different but there's really
good quite taxing and not finance like
stocks or bonds and the whole corporate
finance that was like for my favorite
module and
and I got a 2-1 after so the new guys
ask me a lot about my internship so I
did an internship at the new missile bad
people want to know how I got on
internship well it's all about
networking I ended up going to a women's
dinner for banking and technology and
stuff like that and then I met the
recruiter and you know we start talking
and she's really really nice and show me
more about what they did we got to meet
other women in that industry and then I
do the application and I knew that they
probably remembered my name and
remembered me from that event so if you
can find out about events that happened
like what spring internships in
insightly a lot of banks do inside never
back that's like every industry doesn't
then like that and give you in your
first year take every opportunity you
can now because people want to see that
you have been slow did my internship and
then I receive them offer
and out to New York and
the hotel went down to water Kim
Kardashian career two years as well so
yeah had some really good times up there
it was
a great learning experience there
particularly while my I do is that I do
business analysis and that's what my
skill set Eaters based on everything -
people ask me this what I might Korea
now and I'm up with why struggling no
not necessarily but you know having did
find out solution I have helped me or
helps me michael ranson stuff like that
so really university is about picking up
particular skill sets that can be
applied to any kind of business you am
under my graduates I graduated in 2009
from universities are doing society's
only thing yes I was the president of
the afro-caribbean Society in Manchester
were the two presidents so I was put my
medicine from the other University so I
think the act and yeah I don't know at
the time and loved Manchester while I
was there but was glad to be home and
but lucky enough and she still is
wearing that my quite seem to be husband
my current role so working in consulting
or consultancy firm within business
analysis and so anyone who doesn't know
what consulting is that was another
question I got it is basically he
provides you go to multiple different
companies or industry
and kind of improve processes and
practices we're experts of what we'll do
and again it doesn't mind at work what I
did at university but the skills I learn
at our previous role a little ding or
I'm doing this for my real life in life
everything's about the skills you pick
up and I just cheap everything
encampment and get where they're before
but just keep all the information you
can soak up information because it's
always been yeah that's not very nice
excuse me fix it we're gonna I'll think
you're messing up now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
