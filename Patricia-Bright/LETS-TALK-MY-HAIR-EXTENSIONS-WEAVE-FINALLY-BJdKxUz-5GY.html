video is gonna be all about my hair and
hair extensions and finally how you can
get more details about the hair cuz I
was I basically had quite a few packets
and kind of sold out of those within a
day and so I didn't really respond to
many of the met walk anymore
the mails I got about it because I got
four so many so I want a little bit of
details about hair extensions and hair
extensions that I wear and how you can
get them in a short term and how you can
get them in a certain the hair
extensions I wear are remy hair
extensions and it's a Malaysian hair but
I'm sure it's probably Chinese hair or
really straight Indian hair and it is
Remi and Remi means that all the
cuticles are in line so that means no
tangling my head is not tangling however
it is not what they call virgin hair as
it has been processed and what they've
done is they kind of make this hair so
order and the way that I make it is I
kind of say I want it to look like
relaxed hair and if they give it texture
and everything so it has texture to me
that my own natural hair can blend like
as seamlessly as possible with the hair
extensions itself you know you see kind
of people who you can see their own hair
on top of it it's quite obvious and the
owner is quite coarse and you know all
natural if you have like afro hair
that's not relaxed you're going to be
trying to blend you know really coarse
hair with really silky hair it's just
really damaging to your own hair and it
doesn't look that real so that's why I
was like no I just want you to process
it and make it the way it kind of will
look as natural and more like my hair as
possible and with that it gives it a lot
more fullness as well and yeah that's
all I can really think about it so get
it ordered in and I used to buy in bulk
and that's how I would get kind of
discounts on it because they don't sell
to individual customers but they are
creating a website so a website will be
supplied by the company called true
lengths and when that those are I will
tell you all about that but as it stands
I have
got a hundred pack so the last time at
forty is about forty this summer have a
hundred packs so hopefully people will
not miss out and we'll be able to get a
few packets of hair I'm gonna give you
the details of what is available 12
inches 14 inches 16 inches 18 inches
you're looking at 35 pounds or 12 inches
and you're looking at 52 pounds for the
longest but I've got the details below
so you can check that out what color
does that come in it only color that
comes in one color which is like a
natural black as they don't dye the hair
or anything it's literally some packs a
bit more dark some packs are a bit
lighter but it's kind of like this color
I've been lucky this is quite a dark I
guess or just like interest myself in
the mirror this is quite a dark packet
of hair how long does it last well I
have this in for 3 months but I think
you can go 6 months out say max maximum
but if you're like me I get bored of my
hair really easily and three three or
four months I'm finished but I've worn
it for four months my sister wears it
for six months and if you're really good
over there you could be longer but yes
it lasts very long time shedding it
doesn't shed I can vouch about this hair
because I've been using it for the past
two years you guys arts me all the time
where's your hair from it's always been
the same hair so I can always stand by
the quality of the hair what else is
there the packs are really for people
ask me a bit about what I use so I've
told you guys before when I have like
the layered look and come to the side
fringe and everything it's a to know one
packet of twelve on the top for bulk and
two packets of sixteen at the bottom for
length but sometimes I like 16 14 and 12
and but this time I went for hair that
was a bit longer so this is 18 16 and 14
that's the lips that I have on my hair
right now but 12 and 216 is my favorite
combo my favorite weave combination
people also ask me how many packets will
I need you'll probably need about two
packets for like a normal normal look no
look but if you want a really for great
voluptuous look I'd say go ahead and get
free if you don't use it all
for the next time they are on the way do
you get wet if you want it to cut it and
make clipping tracks you can I also have
about five to ten packets of wavy hair
so I don't know if you remember well I
did
Sammy's hair beauty crushers hair and
I've got a few packets of that in that
color is all we've got Kanna for she
seems to have died it or bleached a loss
have done something fabulous to it
darling
so that is also available that is really
really like there's not feeling that I
think I'll go and I can hour or
something like that but we'll see
there's also a Facebook group now which
I've created just to make it easier for
myself to kind of track who wants what
or who ordered what first until these
guys get their website sorted out and
yeah hopefully I can be this big person
so I can get more weave yeah that's the
arena I think I'll give you all the
details the payments are will be only
accepted by PayPal and that's your
safety and my safety shipping in the UK
will be - between two and three days
that's those first-class recorded
delivery that's three pounds fifty
international is between ten pounds and
15 pounds Europe is six pounds and you
know the most you'll be looking at
internationally is ten days to get to
you Europe you're looking at about six
days to get to you and yeah any other
questions please just send me in an
email but the thing is is that my inbox
will get flooded so if I don't reply
it's either gone or something's happened
so right also on the Facebook wall or
join the Facebook group and then
literally once it's done I will have to
say it sorry guys it's gone I've all
probably do a video to say there's no
more hair so that I don't get any more
messages and then when these guys get
their stuff so I'll let you guys know
but yeah it's looking good around here
we I'll stop being vague I'll speak to
you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
