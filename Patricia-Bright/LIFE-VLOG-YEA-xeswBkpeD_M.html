live floor because I like to keep you
guys in the loop up-to-date what's going
on
things are always changing man in my
life it's just like oh my gosh if it's
not one thing I'm just praying that God
by the end of this year everything will
be a bit more settled and you guys are
always asking me questions like this
this this and you I can't really answer
like I don't really write all the
comments cuz there's so many comments
are kind of respond to but you know if
you're following me on my facebook my
Twitter and my con do I do life holds on
Sundays and then I can kind of interact
with you a little bit more there and
then I can answer your questions more so
life log let's get started first of all
living arrangements
so I told you guys I was healing we were
living in like one room right when we
got back and stuff but I was just I
can't I can't do this I just couldn't
handle it it was just horrible for me so
we move so we allow renting and how it's
really really nice nice and big nice big
kitchen nice massive room we have like
free rein to the whole house and that to
me is perfect because we're in the
process of house-hunting you guys know
that we've been house hunting I can tell
you now that we have seen over 24 houses
I want to show you pictures actually you
know what I like it so like I love
content like old Victorian houses
Victorian oil they drew gaudy and that's
why I want like a period property I'm so
I'm so quintessential on I cringe but
I'm they're trying to get an old house
that's what we're trying to get an old
house I talk I'm sorry I really
apologize for the ramping but yeah I'm
trying to get an old house and then in
the interiors it will just be like mmm
which is lovely
so yeah loads of houses I can show you
like I've seen over like 24 houses loads
like I'm not gonna show you too much but
like I've got piles loads of property
that we've actually gone traipsing
around to see like across London but
we've decided on an area I'm like I know
that area but I won't anything I say
picky I mean they've put an offer on the
house but basically some cash buyers
came in and offered less than us but
because their cash buyers the people
just win straight with them
and as I said a house like but I'm not
disappointed
it because we went out this weekend my
good man so there's I'm talking like you
know we've got that Avenue the houses
you know we made an offer but I was like
happy again we're like well there's a
lot more houses that that meet my
criteria you never know in the next two
or three months he could be moving
alright not you might be here for the
next three years who knows what's gonna
happen and it's been kind of stressful
on fun
no stressful but fun at the same time so
we went in now but we're still on the
hunt and hopefully in the next two or
three months we'll have somewhere to
live now the plan is to kind of renovate
where we live so that's that so what you
guys know I started working I don't I
don't like talking too much about it but
I can tell you that I leave the house at
seven o'clock in the morning you know
sometimes I've had to leave earlier I
get back so yeah working my ass off
oh it's been hard like when you chose
quite quite intense like really intense
and you know it's a it there's four jobs
it's worth it then today it depends on
what your your desire is and what your
kind of motivations are and for me
having a career is really important to
me and the money is important to me you
know so yeah I can do it by God's grace
it's not gonna be like that like all the
time like leaving work at 10:30 at night
in doing 14-hour days it just it just
depends right now and I'm not still
doing the YouTube and everything and
I've married nuni Marian and everything
and I just want to make sure that you
know we're happy and stuff like that so
time with the husband is like really
really essential and that's right after
why I just have to turn everything off
make sure we maximize the weekend Mike's
been an absolute star like Michael
drives me to work like to the station
every morning and picks me up every
night like how keen is that but he
starts really early he starts at 7:30 in
the morning so he's the like he can just
drive and then come back to earth and
stuff like that so it's been really busy
it's been really really interesting as
well career halts will all be on conduct
it won't be on YouTube okay what else
all holidays so I was saying we're bit
we're trying to go on away and either
holiday so I'm trying trying to decide
between going to Paris or going to Spain
or going to Italy so but that's where
we're kind of deciding to go so what do
you guys think Paris Spain or Italy or
Bulgaria they know I'm from Bulgaria has
anyone been to Bulgaria I don't know
I've heard it's nice I didn't think it
was warm but I've heard it's warm and
that's it really like summer's here it's
getting warmer I'm very very happy what
married life has been like amazing
people have asked me about married life
and how it's like two months now so it's
so much yes I've been married for two
months now and have you learned anything
no not really
not anymore I think after a certain
amount of time you should know people
and living together is different cuz we
never lived together before right and
I'm kind of like I'm a little bit
haphazard Michael caused me a bit of a
mess but I'm right and then I have like
overhauls I can't spend two hours like
cleaning and polishing everything right
but once a week I'll do something mad
like that ways Michael is just like
maintains as he goes so actually that's
read quite good and tablets combined and
like we've been eating a lot I don't if
I look a lot fatter but it's like it's
weak because when we're together it's
like we won't we like cooking and eat if
you asked us what we're doing we're
either eating or cooking right that's
what we're always be doing but and it's
been a tsunami like why wouldn't it be
lovely you know we've been like amazing
obviously and I don't know I thought it
was to say I think I don't know and I
must add as well I've been trying to do
some new stuff recently you know can't
I've got some circle lenses which are in
a brown dark brown / black just cuz I
wanted to try something new and I've
been changing at my style a bit just to
see what you know what I could do it
gets boring like watching the same thing
and being the same thing and I know some
people just are not open to change or
new cheaper people doing it okay
just gonna do new things cause I feel
like it if it works it works if it
doesn't yeah again I always like forget
to do laughing
so just tell me below what I've
forgotten to say in the next vlog I will
put it up so I'm selecting guys by</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
