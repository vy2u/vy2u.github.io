vlog firing a good life girl so you guys
know what's been going on
basically because I've been really
inconsistent recently with my videos but
I really want to come back with
vengeance and just really kind of
maximize my YouTube and my friends of
life and my relationships as much as I
can while I can right so you might first
of all let's just give you a heart date
on the house over the whole housing
situation so what you might be able to
see that we are in a new location and
this new clip noodle-like I can't speak
English right now totally apologies but
yeah this new location is in our new
home yeah yeah we have finally kind of
moved in but what kind of sleeping on a
mattress right now because you don't
have a bed but that's a completely
different story but we've finally moved
in so I just want to tell you guys the
process and why it may be you might I've
been so stressed out and I don't know if
you can tell that I've been stressed out
I try not to kind of bring it here on
YouTube because this event money out
there but I think we got married in
March then went on honeymoon and then we
ended up living in like a one-bedroom
and hospital accommodation based on
where my husband worked and we were in
this box room with a bed no internet a
seat in the room a shared kitchen and
the shared bathroom I did that for three
weeks and I was like oh you gotta get me
outta here cuz imma lose my man so of
the three weeks of that widget and maybe
I'm just
that resilient but I felt like that was
torture and then we then ended up
renting in a friend of his and she had a
house and we were staying there we
stayed there for about 2 or 3 months
which is got to be really good but it
was really really far from its outside
of my head it's crazy it was outside of
London so then I ended up having to
commute for really long and I was
working really really late nights and
like 12 o'clock at night and then having
to travel for another two hours at night
it was just ridiculous and that got
quite stressful and there might got a
new job it quite near to where my
parents did so we ended up moving to my
parents home about another three to four
months ago and we thought oh we're only
gonna be in there for two weeks three
weeks we were there for months and the
whole housing you know the I think we
made offers on two different houses two
houses or three houses fell through fell
through the vendors not selling anymore
or we have a survey done one of the
properties literally I cried tears like
oh my god but I thank God that we didn't
get that house because what we got now
is ten million times better than what I
ever thought we were gonna have and it
was just a really really strong it still
is because we're still kind of in the
whole process of moving and stuff but
being a lot more chilled out and stuff
like that so now we've kind of got the
heat of this house over a month ago ish
and then we basically us being the
windows that we were we decided to rip
the whole interior out it was perfectly
fine the way it was but we ripped the
whole thing out and started again got a
canvas new bath you you kitchen it won't
ever forget you actually but knew
everything we plastered knew it like
just the most random kind of interior
design show ever and in our minds and
maybe I'll do like a home tour or
something like that if that's something
you guys want to see but it's not
finished
we don't even have much furniture well
not the furniture that I want as yet so
we're just kind of building that whole
stuff up but yes finally and I'm
definitely gonna be doing a lot more and
luckily enough I have my own kind of
studio space thanks to the hubby and he
thought over and have one the wife
always wins at the end of the day boys
and girls just just learn that now you
know so that's really good news so
hopefully well we're kind of in before
Christmas but I'm gonna be spending
Christmas here but it's nice to have and
being a lot more chilled out and so many
people encourage us and support us
especially on my vlog Channel you guys
have watch me looking like a crazy woman
99% of the time and again with work is
what's been really really busy and I
think I was in two minds about whether
or not to give up YouTube or not but the
thing is is that you can't let work get
in the way of your passions you know and
it was really really hard I wasn't a
hard project but it's got a bit better
recently and I just felt like I couldn't
combine the job and this I felt like I
had didn't have the energy or the
strokes which is free you really odd but
I'm sure some of you out there will
completely understand but like I think
being more settled I feel a lot better
about things and should be able to
combine the two and I really want to
because I love this so that's that what
else can I update you on some of you
might know I have the vlog channel now
which
for months so if you only look at me
looking Craig
go and check out that channel because
the most random things happen there's a
lot of singing my sister's in there
there's a lot of bad singing and dancing
actually but we're just amazing you -
she's even seen Ian Loveall hard who
comes in with her two pence piece she's
talking about herself my soon what
beautiful nobody okay oh thank you I
have the right to continue say go image
in it don't worry we'll get her on here
but right now she's I'll she's not in a
headscarf for those of you know both of
it but she isn't a hat but yet we're
talking about Maureen later in another
video so yeah that's been going on what
else has been going on no holidays but
we're going to well we're going to
Thailand next year hopefully for my
birthday in February so anyone who's
been to Thailand before please do
recommend like you're good the good
places to go because I don't really want
to go to the tourist spots but you know
I think it could be hard to avoid out
there and also potentially going to the
States as well so working at New York
what happened before but my husband
hasn't been so we're looking at New York
and also LA so yes that's what's on that
oh okay yes obviously hair new hair so
you guys might not see it's kind of a
bit funny right now but um I basically I
said that I did this last year like I
basically decided to cut my hair I don't
know whether or not it's like the
periodic thing I feel like I'm cutting
my hair and wearing my hair up but yes
I've cut my hair and
when hair up again and people always are
criticizing my hair because I have
naturally really really fine hair there
isn't nothing I can do about that I've
just always had really really thin hair
even when I had like natural hair so not
relaxed be straightened that thing out
it looked even worse than it looks but
relax it just looked like a fish so like
for me I think that might have us to
stay sure or something but right now
this is all my hair and it looks quite
good my hairdressers really really go
she's been looking after it and she's
kind of like dialed in and gave me the
card
her name's Vicky and I'll put details
below I think she's going to be given
special discount maybe when can we ok
what else is there to tell you guys I'm
not pregnant like people always say
you're fatter like that's not the nicest
thing to say no I've just been stressed
so no I'm not pregnant
not till now give me a year let us
travel let's enjoy you know before you
think about babies people who else is
there
I think I want to tell you guys oh ok
guys so so I've been a bit dry on the
video front but it's you know hard to
think about new things to do so if there
are any new things any new videos you
want to see your things you'd like me to
do let me know because I'm really gonna
start kind of rush in and get it filled
out there for us to enjoy man cuz I
enjoy doing them so let's keep this fun
ok guys I think I've said enough so we
will talk later and I'll see you next
