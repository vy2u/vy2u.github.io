quick video and basically how I kind of
upgrade an outfit to really give me that
kind of autumn look and it's so simple
to really transform your outfit to look
a lot more autumn orientated so let me
just quickly show you what I've done so
first thing in terms of my accessories
you know I never wear that many
accessories but i do love wearing a
watch and a necklace and really if you
wear those of gold and silver well you
can just transfer this and where rose
gold instead very very warm and just I
think really suitable for the autumn
season to the add to the autumn flavor I
just love adding some layers and m-fer
basically this is a book by it's faux
fur from zara but just these little sure
things look really really like perfect
than Alterman when it's not too cold in
the doctor where massive jacket but you
want to have that kind of snuggly
feeling a little fur trims a great way
to do it on the bottom I'm just wearing
a pair of skinny jeans which I wear all
year round basically but you know I mean
ending that lovely burgundy color which
is so autumn and I'm still wearing black
balls it so probably shouldn't but it's
fairly warm right now so I love just
folding up my jeans as well at the ankle
I don't know I just really like the way
that looks so I think it's really fun to
me not so really want to meet your
sister style different again with my
accessories I love leather always I've
ever but there's always a nice
difference when you add a bit of color
and a bit of texture so this part of my
bag is suede and like a brown suede
which is just absolutely perfect for the
altar
season though guys I hope you like this
little ways that you can kind of upgrade
your look and make it a lot more oughta
me so thanks watching guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
