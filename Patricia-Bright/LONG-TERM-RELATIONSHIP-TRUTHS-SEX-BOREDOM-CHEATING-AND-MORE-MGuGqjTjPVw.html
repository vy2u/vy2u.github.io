same
oh shit some truth mid myself and ask
how do you know someone is the one you
know you get that scene in a casting
line so guys today we are talking about
relationship truth and I told you guys
on snapchat and Twitter and some of the
questions and messages you guys send to
me I'm like ah alright we're really
going to get into it aren't we
for those of you who've never watched me
come before or don't know who I am
hi I'm Trisha welcome to my channel you
can subscribe if you're not already
subscribed but I have basic keeping in a
relationship for like 10 long years
no not 10 long is what yet but then that
relationship was basically 10 years and
I'm celebrating my five years of
marriage me and my partner we met
University when I was like 18 he was 20
so we met when we were kind of young and
that that stage is growing up together
but what I wanted to do is to kind of
give you guys a little bit of home
truths about you know long-term
relationships and what it's actually
like from my perspective and make my
story and then also answer some of your
questions so relationship truth number
one is that you know clearly everything
is not teaching so the DA not rocket
science and say that most relationships
people have ups they have down they have
arguments they have blowouts they have
walking out the doors I've had a couple
of walking out the doors might have a
couple of walking out the doors that ish
happens and I think the difference
between like relationships that goes and
mal is that when blow-up pattern how did
the people address it and I think I feel
like with a lot of people in
relationship when I look at some
people's relationships like they don't
talk it's like there's a blow-up or
something and then they just never come
in and dress it or they address it at
the time where things are happening and
it goes really really left field I think
that when it comes to having blow up in
like relationships is not to do anything
that is going to be permanently
destructive
and anything for the call or saying just
words that are just beyond cutting which
is one of those things I'm not going to
even lie I can have a shaft mount as
what my mother would say like shucks man
I would say won't be noted but what a
good that come from and I have to learn
real quickly that I can't say those
things what blow-ups definitely happened
in like long time a relationship the
best thing that you can do though is to
address what causes that grow up try to
prevent it from happening and also
communicate and talk about it after it
happened
not at the time that is going on because
it's just gonna become a shouting match
or like silent match relationship number
two is that people get bored of each
other like you know what the truth of
the matter is that sparks fly in a
different way and when I say in regards
to being bored with each other is that a
case of you know before you're not
always going to be doing stuff or like
constantly busy let's do something
really exciting and we get to my age but
you're much like don't say anything
let's just sit here in silence silence
actually something that two people
appreciate especially if you hear each
other's voices all the time so when I
used to see like my partner or New
Year's coming around to my house I'm not
oh my god you know you get that scene in
it
okay that's what that was okay I'm not
even gonna night I'm not going to like
that if Michael goes away for a couple
of days or we haven't seen each other or
I've been really busy or he's been
really busy but when we get to have a
weekend together we get quite excited
like ah like if I could almost like a
breathing out so I do definitely have
that so happy to see you babe it's not
the butterflies but it's like like all
is well with the world when I see you
you're in a relationship and when you
see your partner you think oh here they
are again I mean you might want to
reassess that situation guys it might
not be great another relationship truth
is that you don't have to live with
someone to knows what they like or who
they are and I never lived with Michael
before we got married
never like we spend lots of time with
each other with fade over each others
terms of stuff but we never like how to
flap together or move in with each other
or anything like that and I know a lot
of people feel like you know you need to
live with someone before you get to know
who they are but I think that someone is
always someone at particular point in
time but they change based on life and
experiences and things that happen to
them and actually the person you might
have left live with them for a year and
said yeah you know what levels live with
them for you they're amazing yet that we
get married to them ten years times they
might be a different person and nobody
stays the same however I think what you
find is that there is a fundamental
foundation about a person that you kind
of decide you know what I'm here for it
it means that you can kind of work the
storms of personality changes because
there's a fundamental foundation that
you see in someone relationships reason
number two is I do not believe that
there is the one oh my god my fuse the
one he's my soulmate and like no but I I
really genuinely don't believe that and
I know some people is always short no I
think that you know there could be five
or six different people who I could
spend the rest of my life with and I
always say if I say relationship is it's
all about choices also love is a choice
like it making this decision to
continually be with a person or relate
to that person or you know to give that
person and it's a choice that you keep
making every single day and I think that
say another guy not now but like the guy
is like he has that fundamental
foundation that I look for in a person
he he felt that I had that fundamental
trait and then we were both like you
know what we are the we are the kind of
people are going to choose to stay in
this relationship and choose to work on
this relationship he can also be my the
one so there is no the one there is a
once at the moment and the one that you
choose to stay with in relationships why
people end up breaking up a lot is
because they choose you know what I'm
not going to give my time I'm not going
to sacrifice I'm going to give up and
what you'll find is that there's one
person in relationship who's giving
their all and the other
person who is not given at all another
relationship shoes is that the way that
you love each other kind of changes so
yeah it's not like love changes so when
you're like young and a teen aging and
raised together like you love each other
in a kind of infatuation way and
actually like when me and Mike will go
away on holiday like so we have a little
night out you know there's no baby great
but we love each other in that same way
we love each other like only way you
really young and like that kind of more
like how I love you like you know
logging in the club that we never Debbie
we might have done that once in a while
yeah I feel like the way that you love
each other is different and it for me I
feel like I love my partner more now and
but also differently is more I don't
iconic so it's like a warm last it's
like a really deep heat love or a firm
foundation lovers is just a fleeting
love and obviously you know the passion
and stuff can still be there at times
when all times I know it's not always
behind
took my seat but you know we could have
those moments love definitely changes
but it doesn't get worse or better it
just becomes a different type or a
different feeling of love and I wish
there's a way to like explain it
yes I don't know that maybe you guys
know about way of explaining love this
is another relationship truth meaning in
the relationship is not going to make
you happier if anything it can actually
make you unhappy er and the reason being
when you are single all you've got to
think about is you you yourself and I
need myself and add to felt like gap in
it and you don't have to think about
anybody else's time anybody else's
schedule anybody else hurting you
anybody else breaking your heart anyone
else being late for you anyone else not
doing something away with you trust me
when you're in a relationship there is
this level of compromise you can't do
just what you want to do when you want
to do how you want to do you have always
got another person to think about and
not everybody is ready for that there's
nothing wrong you feel someone is
slightly selfish like people say dinner
well as kids because they're selfish you
know what at least you know then you
bringing kids into this world then you
have being a awful parent like what's
the point in being that person and the
same weapons were like some people they
want to get in relationships and then
they're unhappy you you are Russia what
are you watching - you aren't ready to
give of yourself and also you got with
something wasn't ready to give up
themselves either
so enjoy your moments of synchronous
because sometimes it's absolutely
necessary until you are ready to kind of
you know be willing to compromise
another thing that you want that you
ain't going to be able to get huh that
is actually a real true so so the some
of my relationship shoes I'm going to go
ahead this video is going to be long
I've decided that I actually like
longing but videos if I do a 30 minute
video this is just going to be what
happens we should have a segment like
the long videos the long airs video
segments when did you know that he was
the one I do not believe there was any
point in time what I thought you know
what my partner is the one
I think as a light feature that we
continue to grow together I realize
we've got time I realized that here
they're the key things that I knew that
I wanted in a partner and I knew that he
would make a good husband and a good
father
okay cool I want to get married because
I was the kind of person that I needed
to sell them because I can be all over
the place my eyes my mum says I've got
wild eyes I might as you can probably
tell so I felt like being in a being
married really early was a good
foundation for me to like get on with
the rest of my life it was evidence of
certain traits that make me know yet
he's the one how often do you argue and
how do you ensure arguments are resolved
for the best of the relationship Oh
Chisholm truth I will say that meanness
what's the definition of argue we might
have like a big blowout argument like
once every three months like a bit like
a big argument or something like that we
might have bickering moments like once a
week at least like like a little bit
about others but you didn't take that
out but not other than my job to do that
though but why don't you do that so we
will have that kind of biscuit and a lot
of the times you'll find that in
relationships it's little things that
can cause a problem I am Telling You
that we had an argument
because Michael ordered pizza from Pizza
Hut and not Pizza Express it was a
genuine argument over you go into the
wrong pizza store King imagine and this
happens in relationship and people have
realized is the little things that cause
argument and I think one of the things
I've been learning to do is it's not
everything to have a moan about because
it's not you're going to ask you over is
it tap water or bottled water the one
thing I like to do is you know accept
that I'm wrong and also for my husband's
part is to say sorry because sometimes
guys don't like to say sorry they like
to solution eyes and explain it to why
they're not wrong but a sweet word oh
I'm sorry I didn't mean II can kind of
you know make an argument go away why
are you guys try to talk to you why they
have a whole girlfriend but your
girlfriend is living and breathing yet
you are always in my
and text messaging telling me about hair
want to see you hey hey hey no this time
I saw this do so made me love my my head
ah I mean I feel like this sounds really
bad I feel like guys are 3d now like if
they're not settled down they have a
girlfriend but they still want to do a
little bit tasting what was out there
what's opportunity for my perspective as
a lady you shouldn't be the opportunity
and I think that girls nowadays need to
do their research there are some guards
I know of who they were dating someone
they thought it was you know official
until they file on Instagram that their
man got married to another woman
Oh Oh today little research ladies do
your research
the struggle is very real out there very
real okay how do you keep the fire off
the ten years together you to literally
goals
oh and execute the honors Chase is my
client is my best friend like genuinely
my best friend we crack so much joke
together we enjoy each other's company
there are things we like to do together
and also we talk a lot like in
relationships nowadays but everything
ends up going online or if Wanda lives
on their phone like me try having those
phones in the bedroom we try to make
sure we would communicate and just make
sure we're present with each other
that's how we keep the spark alive oh so
a period when you wanted to break up his
mic if yes and wife okay so we did break
up and I believe that I roamed during
that time like back in the day like it's
like six years ago or something
we had a breakup and we had a breakup
with Michael was in Manchester and I was
in London and I was I'll be honest the
breakup was because I was in the heights
like I was in London I was interning you
know I was partying every night I was
like I want to live my life and then he
was in Manchester and I was in London
and he had no plan on moving to London
and I only found a limited Manchester so
I thought maybe our relationship wasn't
going to happen because you know I
didn't I didn't know how it was going to
work we just weren't sure about where
our relationship was going to go or if
we were going to do it how does your
relationship change
what you're married especially once that
hunting phase is over I feel like you
get very comfortable each other like
real comfortable as each other and I
think you communicate more and I think
you communicate more about everything so
sometimes I don't think you know when
you're dating that people don't see like
the things that hurt you or upset you or
the true like raw raw raw emotional
emotion that you might be feeling but
when you're married it all let out like
your partner's women see actually
everything about you or they should do
and in my relationship
like Michael seen every side of me like
literally every sin I've seen every side
of him as well and it's the kind of
thing that no one outside of this
marriage would ever see right no one
would see it oh my god so this one this
person went all the way in absolutely
actually amazing relationship choose yes
is set still the same like in the
relationship day one will not be as
great as year 20 not just a compassion
change and I was told that if your
partner's huger given but your sexual
attraction is different so I will number
one say oh my gosh this is it over
please family turn off right now
especially right now
so is it the same no it is not the same
I would say it is different I think that
the key thing that happened is that the
longer you're with someone the more
comfortable you are with someone so the
more you're able to try to explore and
to also know what works for someone so I
feel like all that awkwardness is gone
and I feel like when you're with someone
in early days when you're with some when
it's kind of awkward but you know after
that 10 years right you're not awkward
no Mike let's go artless up let's get
that one level to say about this there's
a compassion change yeah I think that
when you're with someone for longer your
throat trying to pleasure each other a
bit more because you want to keep
everything exciting so that's a good
thing I was told that if your birth
partner CG human versus sexual
attraction is different I just
completely disagree let's just get into
it when I was pregnant like myself I was
like I was like all the way but
afterwards I was like really on it and
he's like
I'm here for it so yes that's all I'm
gonna say about that when dating on
married do the thought of having to Goku
and your mate knowing that your cooing
brother you and not of course the
worrying about this do you know what I
know exactly what you mean but if I went
in his house and you know when we first
started dating I would definitely not do
another to dilute and let's see I think
if you go about doing that early on your
nappy you are nasty and there's nothing
wrong we're having a - but let's not
just it's not the first day I meet you
you go upstairs or you start you know
you know releasing all your bodily
fluids in his bathroom is not that deep
and they took do you know what I'll be
honest with you I think we wait to do
married to get comfortable like that
honestly I wasn't comfortable like just
taking a dump in his loo or letting you
know by the way I just need to go take a
dump like yeah no no no no no however
now now we're like lucky for us to do it
constipated I'll be like well you know
what vindaloo like well maybe you should
take some of this this metaphorical
company so we get--we volkoff's the
Royal bit now which is actually you know
because at the time like I would have
died but do I think it's normal for 24
year olds who has never been in the
relationship to not be interested in
being in one nope if you are not
interested in relationships and you're
not the funny thing is I think that and
this is what I'm saying that
relationships are not anything like it
in some circumstances is actually nicer
to be single going to be with someone
and to be stressed and I think it's
really important for people to reflect
on themselves there are many people who
are happy single long-term however I
mean when you're in the old age pension
the time women you'll buy yourself
really look at that would be over sad
news is you've got one tear on his own
your face you might want to figure out
your life choices however you might you
might go in like an amazing entity or an
amazing orphanage or I don't know you
might do something in your mind that
touches so many people where you end up
having a family who aren't your remote
family but our family and another one
if you're not thinking about
relationships just make sure they're
thinking about the song and making sure
that you're happy
how important is fits in a relationship
I think that citizens of course very
very important in a relationship but I
think that also reflective of how good
you feel with each other but when we've
been tense or had arguments and stuff
the last thing that's on our mind is
basically even being attracted to each
other but if our relationship is good
and like with Carmen was been
communicating and we in a good place
it'll be happening all the time which is
for the good thing it's marriage really
what it seems when you watch and see on
Instagram and snapchat no definitely not
what you see are highlights of
relationships people are not going to
vlog or they're screaming at each other
people are not going to be holding
cameras when they're not talking to each
other they're not gonna be doing that
but I can be like so right now meaning
and position we're not talking like
they're not going to do that so what you
see are the best bits or moments which
people are enjoying or people or things
that people are just doing because
they've got to do it for the cameras so
know that I think that internet is any
kind of resemblance of real-life
relationship how to get over next I mean
they say get under someone else but I
completely disagree that time time is a
healer red flags to indicate that he is
not the one I thought up all the way
over here all the time looking at
someone else secretiveness so I mean my
privacy was privacy what is privacy
there's no such a time I didn't have
privacy growing up my mom kicked out my
door in my home no mercy I have every
part of EV every knock I have everything
and it is vice versa like I think people
who want to be separate like I throw my
phone at my partner like they look at
this but not it's nothing so people are
like arguing um privacy what's your
wives people you don't have other
options
I am your option real private together
so yeah red flag what do forgive if your
partner cheated and promised to never do
it again and another person art can
relationships and
hacklin or he'll after cheating and my
honesty fitna can I think that people do
make mistakes
I think cheating is one of those
mistakes that definitely happens and I
think that you can think that the most
innocent person would never cheat or and
they might do
gachi and then certain guys for just
obvious constant cheat cheaters and some
women choose to be with them I'm not I'm
not here to that however if I had a
partner who T in one time I would
definitely be able to forgive them I
don't think cheating is a is a deal
breaker actually don't crazy right
alright guys so that is my long-ass
relationship through the videos I loved
it I had a fun time filming it I love
all your questions you guys really went
in there I feel like I've revealed a lot
I don't know if it will or go in the
video but we will see but yeah if there
are any other topics that you guys want
me to talk about please do let me know I
would do them I can't wait to do more
stuff like this I think I loved it I
