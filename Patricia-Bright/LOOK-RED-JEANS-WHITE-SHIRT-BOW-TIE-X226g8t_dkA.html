video it's going to be a combination of
a few different types of days such as
trend watching and after the day but do
they really going to be focusing on
colored jeans and kind of the men's kind
of androgynous look that I'm loving at
the moment and a few different ways that
I've started so let me get started with
the jeans so right now a new color jeans
I think I'm a professional what they do
they always come into fashion every
summer but I'm not showing the the care
that I have and it's from Topshop these
are in a lovely lovely maroon color and
I like this kind of a matter of my
school uniform this was the color of my
school uniform exactly and collagen is
always coming to fashion around summer
and sometimes they're a bit bright or
the Reggie girl quite bright or the
greens you got right right and I'm
really as I said I'm not really into
bright colors but what I really like
okay we've got some toned down muted
colors that you can transition into
winter very very effectively I saw these
and I thought they were beautiful these
are the Baxters skinny jeans and I am a
28 waist and a 30 long for anyone who
wants to know and can get them you know
higher on the waist low over the waist
if you want to and the skinny leg is
great now I think I may exchange these
for the Jamie because the Jamie are a
bit skinnier on the ankle because the
Baxter is not as super skinny as the
journey but still quite like them right
now so copper jeans are just a great way
to add a flash of color to an outfit and
that in my opinion I don't want to go
really really bright with anyone
these kind of outfits it's always just
not me and I would combine jeans at
least with something like you know
you've ever seen is from H&amp;amp;M just
something plain in terms of playing in
color but maybe has prim the pattern in
terms of lace or in terms of its texture
and mixing up the textures would be
really really cool like a suede top I've
got this base top from H&amp;amp;M gorgeous team
it with your standard white vest really
your white vest is going to look really
really chic and stylish the jeans so now
this is the next trend but I'm willing
to discuss and it's the whole
androgynous trends quite masculine quite
sleek lines and I just think it's so
cool and you can also incorporate the
colored denim into this kind of look to
add another pop if you don't want to
look too blur and to wife so all you
need to really do is we have a nice
fitting clean lines
preferably in a white but I think a
black one with the white tie would look
amazing as well actually and you can
kind of get an idea of what your left
side and you can either go to the bow
tie or you can go for the really skinny
and the time I've gone from the bow tie
I'm feeling a bit gentleman ash and he
because you were in looks like with red
jeans
well the regime dreams what I do is give
you a little look at the shoes that I'm
wearing so guys this is just a closer
look on the shoes that I'm wearing I'm
going to call them the Hefner slippers
because they kind of remind me of the
guy from the Playboy Mansion and and
they're very very androgynous as the
style that I'm talking about is it's got
this lovely leather trimming around it
as well I hope you can see that and you
know it just adds that little bit of
extra cool chic - announcer you think
that these are multiple colors might
even see them with the tassels the
tassel
but they were 50 quid and I really
didn't spend fifty quid and just add in
extra tassels we could probably also add
some kind of like and I brought you
something on the top of them if you
really wanted to just to be a little bit
different so that is the end of my video
this is the androgynous look combined
with the colored denim which is a
favorite for this season and you know
going forward that's watching guys right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
