video a little bit of a different
location I am in my half-finished
kitchen and I thought I would do my
updated diet and regime at the moment
you guys know that I was on the kind of
health and fitness journey and I'm gonna
be real with you right I kind of dropped
off right I went to Thailand and that
tom yum soup
and that green Thai curry and everything
just threw me off right and I basically
became you know I just forgot all about
my health and fitness and I was enjoying
myself with fried ice cream on the
beaches
I really wasn't as disciplined as I had
been earlier on and if you guys have
been following me you would know that
I'd kind of been on a really good health
and fitness journey that was really
important to me anyway
I lost a couple of pounds but I
basically gave it all back and so I
thought okay it's time for some drastic
action and even me doing this is like my
first step of kind of getting back to
you know being as fit this half is what
I want to be now my current weight is
132 pounds I've done my research so
probably about nine stone six and
sometimes a bit bigger as well I'm not
very big but I definitely have problem
areas and my problem area is this belly
of mine
everywhere else might be quite skinny
and bony but this belly just seems to
hold a lot of excess fat and it is my
bug bear and some of you guys will know
that and I get people asking me if I'm
pregnant no I'm not pregnant
okay I just carry excess and weight here
so my key thing is trying to kind of get
rid of any excess fat that I have and
basically tone up you really fear and
really
and just have me muscle I basically was
looking for like a kind of like a
protein healthy diet to do and I've seen
people doing loads of these so I kind of
did my research and I found one called
protein world and I saw that kind of
lots of people from thali had done it
and a couple of other people had done it
as well so I thought should not let me
try this one what I really liked about
it was I liked the look and feel that
makes any sense and they have loads of
options as well so the blend that I'm on
is called the slender blend but I saw
they add more for weight gain for muscle
gain they had loads of different ones
and I've got like a flyer thing for it
here as well had a whole bunch of
different things in it and I like the
detail that I got in this so that's what
I'm currently using and what I'm doing
is more replacement so basically I make
a smoothie for breakfast and I have a
smoothie fitting and it's simply that
and I've been wanting to do like juices
and smoothies for so so long but I've
never actually done it yet and I thought
okay this is definitely going to help me
to do it I did really know how to make
some movies and it looked like it was so
much effort but that it really really
isn't I basically go to Tesco and let me
show you and they have frozen fruit
chunks this is the mango fruit chunks
amazing top top frozen mango put it in
the freezer it's two pounds and they've
got the same for pineapple as well it's
two pounds I can genuinely make like a
week to two weeks worth of smoothies
from this and I always buy the mixed
fruit berries as well a delicious and I
also buy it frozen eyes so so simple to
make a smoothie like this and what I add
is the slender bender protein powder now
basically this means that this is a
little bit more healthy it's got more
nutrients in it and it makes me not be
so hungry and if that's all I'm eating
for breakfast so guys I'm going to show
you exactly how easy it is to make a
smoothie and so I use my phone
and chance I go ahead and just grab a
handful I'm really not a massive
measurer kind of person so I just think
you know what's going to work for me
it's my frozen mango and I also add a
frozen pineapple I can make enough to
probably last me for the whole day
definitely for my breakfast and
definitely for my evening meals
sometimes it's great for like the next
day as well and then some berries there
I love the berries are so good they make
it really smooth and then I probably add
about half a banana and if I really feel
like the banana taste
I'll just put more now I don't like milk
so I don't add milk or anything like
that to my smoothies but I add ice in
there and then I add two scoops of my
protein world blend and this is the
slender blend so kind of aids
weightloss out to offset this you can
either add juice or you can add water
I'm going to try and add just 50/50
because juice Rooney isn't that healthy
for you but it tastes so good then add
in the other apple juice and then I'm
going to add a little bit of water as
well and that will help it to kind of
blend properly let's get blend in let's
see how thick this is if it's too thick
then I just add a bit more water but I
like it really thick as well that's not
too thick that's not too thick in my
opinion for some of you guys it might be
I like that mm-hmm
you can definitely taste the vanilla in
this it tastes so so good and as you can
see I have my special breakfast smoothie
glass oh that looks so good
so this is basically what I have as a
breakfast smoothie I love it I really
don't get hungry and when I just have
this but if I do get hungry I might just
have a slice of toast or a poached egg I
sometimes try to take multivitamins I'm
one of these people that are not so good
at taking them but I do try to take them
once in a while now when it comes to
lunch I try to keep it healthy and maybe
do something like a stir-fry or a rice
and chicken you going I love my rice and
chicken but upon spare fried lots of
vegetables and look with noodles in it
is good enough for me
and keeps me nice and full till the
early evening
while I like to add is a little bit of
fish sauce as well and I'm going to add
my salsa
the next I just added my bean sprouts
and veggies with lettuce and some onions
and carrots and that's basically it
and I'm gonna add some noodles to it and
I just get my from the local Korean shop
and more soy sauce can be added to taste
that's basically my stuff bye guys now
when it comes to working out you guys
know hey go to the gym and the weather
is so so so I might try and have a
little run in the park not regularly but
I definitely do some working out at home
and then after I work out I go ahead and
have another smoothie and obviously it's
really great to take protein actually
after you workout because it helps to
repair your muscles and that helps you
with your metabolism overall you stop
burning that fat and you become sexy and
slim right but with the current program
and young protein wad I'd probably lose
between 2 and 4 pounds a week which is
really really exciting as I said I'm not
trying to necessarily get really really
skinny I just want to get rid of like my
excess fat and have nice lean muscles
and I'll be honest with you it's really
hard to be disciplined and I love love
love eating food who doesn't love eating
food but so that's what I'm currently
doing and I'm hoping that I'm just going
to be able to get fitter and leaner and
feel bit more comfortable about the
weight that I carry but I think everyone
has to basically come up with a brand
right and follow through this what I'll
do in my description box I'll put a link
to the site it's called protein world
and I'll also put some of the smoothies
that I like to make and I'll summarize
my common regime and I'm going to keep
you on track with what kind of progress
and actually making and who knows I
might come in here in a bikini like I've
made it so guys I hope you enjoyed that
video make sure you check out my
description bar below I have all the
details in there and I hope this just
gives you guys a bit of motivation and
idea of maybe what you might want to do
smoothies
juicing is a really good way to start
living healthy life so I'm feeling the
benefits of it already so guys thank you
so much for watching and I'll see you
later bye
never</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
