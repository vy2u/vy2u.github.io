kind of my buddy qualms and like where I
really want to work on so number one I'm
what they call skinny fat and I'm I'm in
skinny fat anymore I'm kind of like
moving on but growing up I was very very
skinny and I could eat McDonald's every
single day twice a day pancakes and
sausage in the morning with a bit of
syrup and I'm burger meal in the evening
and nichy own every seat gained anyway
because full of my vlogs and my
Instagram you know that I'm a foodie I
think I've been little bit with food
obsession but I really wanted to focus
on doing a trans formation that it's
like wow look at the footfall and look
at the after but to target areas on my
stomach region people always say to me
Patricia are you pregnant like it's very
rude to say that however the answer that
question is no it's just my lunch baby
okay
and my bum is something really nice like
shelf um but it kind of dissipated it
into a lump of jelly and I'm like it's
time to get it back it's time to get it
back so today I'm going to start off
with showing you a couple of exercises
from the skinny bitch workout these are
really good exercises for targeting
areas and just great cardio as well and
