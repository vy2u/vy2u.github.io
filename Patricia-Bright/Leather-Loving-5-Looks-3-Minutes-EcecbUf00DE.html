so I've been looking for my wardrobe
recently and I realized that I had a
heck of a lot of leather items in my
wardrobe and I've become I've actually
always been a massive fan of leather so
I thought I'll show you a few different
ways that I wear leather myself and how
I kind of put them get into different
outfits and different bits of leather
that you can add to a look so I'll get
started first things first
it's the leather trousers and my leather
trousers are from Zara and I absolutely
love them they've got like a gorgeous
quilt pattern but I found they can look
really good really quite relaxed with
like a jump or something quite um I
don't know cozy so you've got the
hardness of the leather but something
cozy with the wooly jumper and I love
the way that looks together so next I've
got the nether pleated skirt and I've
got two of these so this is a pleat one
and I've got plain one but I love the
lever in an a-line I'm not so sure you
know into it when it's kind of like a
pencil skirt in leather it's a bit hit
or miss there but I really love the way
this looks I move like some color on top
can look really gorgeous like kind of
like a dinner outfit or something out
with the girls
so if you're a bit more daring you can
go ahead and try things like leather
dresses and stuff and let the dresses I
think are really really sexy and great
for nights out and sometimes you might
need to break it up with you know some
color or some texture or something this
dress is from love clothing but I love
the way leather dresses look they are
very sexy so other ways I like to wear
leather is also in accessories so I've
got this necklace here which is from
monkey I like the straps here are
leather and I've also got this shirt
which is from Primark and the collar is
also leather as well and I think that
looks really really cute
finally it's got to be the leather
jacket the leather jacket is a trademark
for a lot of us and I find it so cozy
great thing to wear in the winter layout
with some sweaters and stuff on the
inside and you just look so cool and
ready to go
so like I hoped you enjoyed that video
and it gave you a few different ideas on
how to wear leather and swatching guys
