ever do giveaways and like promote
companies and stuff like that just
because there's no need for me to do it
and that March but I was contacted by a
company called Ruger boots who you can
kind of see me wearing in the snow their
booths and the the car they contacted me
at a timely time basically did they know
it was gonna snow maybe they did but
yeah they've supplied me with basically
ugg boots which are fur boots which have
a sheepskin lining like this and these
are called worker boots these ones and
their fur all the way inside and it's
real not for sheepskin it is real
sheepskin by the way and it's like a
hundred percent genuine leather on the
outside and lovely it's a really really
thick so as well it's not one of the
ones that you just see them when they
all lean off and stuff like that and I
think the thing with uggs and this style
of shoe is that it's either one of those
things that you love or you hate but the
truth of the matter is that these will
keep your feet warm I wore these in the
snow I've warned them when I was walking
through six inches of snow when we had
to part the car down another Road
because we could not get to my road
because of the snow and these protected
my feet and stop me from getting
frostbite oh yeah it did and guess what
guys I have five pairs to give away to
you yes so whether you love them hope
you hate them I know that you look would
love a free pair especially when we know
that February's gonna be awfully cold in
the UK and maybe for those of you in
Canada and wherever it's really cold
like Austria or something like that
ulcer be are you guys know unnecessarily
this stuff is it really does work so I'm
going to tell you guys how you can win a
pair and
yeah what we need to do is actually
comment on this video and free of you
will receive a pair or you just have to
comment I'd love a pair or look I don't
want that let's just do something
different I want you to give free

offer for you and trust me you guys you
