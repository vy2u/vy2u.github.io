video is going to be a haul I bought a
lot of things recently kind of like a
collective haul from Azores Primark and
Topshop and it's her mainly clothing and
lots of different clothing for the
summer instead so let me just quickly
show you so this first thing that I got
was this jumpsuit and actually this
that's quite vibrant for me because you
guys knows I'm not I'm not the most
vibrant person but I bought this
beautiful cool acht skirt outfit skirt
outfit while culottes
jumpsuit from a Zeus calm and I just
loved their own pattern and the apples
on there and I just thought it was
really really different and a really
nice color and this would be perfect on
my holidays as well most of the stuff I
purchased and it's in the petite section
because I think it was only exclusive to
petite but then I got in a size 10 which
should fit me fine but another thing I
bought was a beautiful orange so wrong
and it's like a nice sheer see-through
color which is just gorgeous with like a
gold tie a cold tie gold ring at the
side now this is something I'll
definitely wear on the beach and my
holiday essential videos you'll
definitely see this so sticking with
culottes and actually the kind of blue
I bought these ones from ASOS as well
and it's this gorgeous cobalt blue and
these are culottes but it's so nice it
actually looks like a skirt and fits
really well it's quite sure but because
it's short it's not too bad and it's got
these really nice button detailing on
the very top and they loved it they
loved it yeah I bought the these are not
whites but these are black and white
dogtooth cropped trousers and I saw them
now that yeah yeah these are nice these
are different they're very very smart
they're like tailored but I thought that
the design on them the dog truth from
them all over is really different and
you don't really find these every one I
thought they were really pretty
so yeah culottes clearly I have a minis
obsession going on and I bought this
white a tall dude once again obsession
with white this white cool locked outfit
with a gorgeous bow detail here on
hope you can see that and it's in the
linen so this would be great for like my
holiday and a day dress or day outfit
and it's short but it's pleated shorts
as well actually from the motel brand I
got got this back swing crop top with
these gorgeous rose details on it and I
thought oh my gosh this is so bright and
so pretty and they lives it endures eat
I was very impressed this time because
usually I get stuff from a source and I
hate it but I was very very impressed by
some of the stuff and the quality yeah
Wow
shop then finally I bought this textured
for kid body con skirt it is really it's
not really short what its kind of sure
but I love the color and the roughage in
the detail on that and I'm quite curvy
but this is quite good not hiding
clothes but minimizing it so it's not
like oh my gosh so much everywhere but
yeah I don't know what is this the
texture that does it so I really really
like that so I let me move on to the
stuff I blow from so let me just say
that Primark are currently going in and
I'm really loving live right now and I
shouldn't look like as much as I do but
I do so I don't go there that regularly
because sometimes I hate this stuff but
anyway they will just show you the stuff
that I got
so these babies these babies are amazing
these are you know they're maxi trousers
they they look like a maxi skirt but
they're not a maxi skirt maxi trousers
and there she there she they've got
shorts with in them and they've got the
sheer legs I really hope you can see
that because this stuff this right here
Wow this is give this in my summer this
is going to be my summer trouser
absolutely gorgeous they look so elegant
they look so expensive but they were
just 13 pounds I just love love love
those then I also got this gorgeous
swing top and I don't know why it's
looking kind of ready on camera but it's
like a Coralie wine color and it's like
a gorgeous swim top swing top and you
guys know I can't get enough for spoon
tops this would look great with a body
con skirt or tucked into
something I bought these these trousers
they're kind of they're not like Korean
trousers because they're quite fitted
and cropped and they're just really
really pretty very very elegant as well
could probably wear these to work if I
wanted to but yeah these are nice as
well
finally I'm loving the white again and
loving the maxi I ended up with this
gorgeous limited edition white maxi
skirt now you can't see all the detail
I'm sure you can't but it is gorgeous my
sisters like who do you think you are an
angel on the Christmas tree yes yes I
yeah yeah fabulous this is and I'm very
very happy that I got that also got
these red shoes from Primark and yeah
they're bargain they were ten pound they
won't like sale from 14 pounds and I
think these would just be nice from my
holiday just quite comfortable very soft
and squidgy on the bottom and yeah I
really really like that though my next
set of stuffs from H&amp;amp;M and I got quite a
bit of a variety here so I got this top
and it's been around for ages I see it
for ages and I never picked it up but I
thought you I didn't pick it up and pick
up and it fits gorgeously it's very
different it's got this leather
detailing on those sleeves and this
level detailing on the top and I'm not
gonna wear it now because it's too long
for this but I'm thinking that come
winter I'll be really happy I have
something like this I bought this kind
of lace crochet top which I hope you can
see I hope my camera is picking up the
detail of this it's may not be but yeah
nice I love the lace design that was on
it it's quite unique but I'm a bit
concerned because I've got so much stuff
like this one like Patricia seriously
and it's crop and it's swing and it's
white and it's cream you know it's just
me all over really but if you've got a
style you might as well stick to it if
it were next up I ended up at Topshop of
course now Topshop it has always got
some good stuff but by this point in
time I was tired but I bought this
gorgeous white top this yeah white top
and I love the the knitted detailing on
here it's so elegant and I hope you
see I'm not sure if you can but the
detailing are beautiful beautiful
darlings and yeah it was elegant I was
in the why and just a very nice loose
factory it was expensive
it's 26 pounds and I'm thinking for a
vest really that would you
people who loves then bought these
culottes again but all that is beautiful
that fabric the drape everything about
them are beautiful my only issue is that
they are a little bit short and when I
bend over it's a full moon but I don't
know if I work with tights now not an
issue and then finally I bought this
like boob-tube crop top
underwear thingy Bobby which I kind of
like kind of don't like the cups are
very small very small so it looks kind
of strange but it's cute and it's
cropped if you work with like a
high-waisted skirt or gorgeous this
would be fabulous darling that's it and
you can take the straps off as well and
everything and that was 20 pounds when
this is the end of my haul I hope that
you enjoyed it and if you want to see
some of the outfits on you'll probably
see them in coming videos anyway so
watch out for that as watch it guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
