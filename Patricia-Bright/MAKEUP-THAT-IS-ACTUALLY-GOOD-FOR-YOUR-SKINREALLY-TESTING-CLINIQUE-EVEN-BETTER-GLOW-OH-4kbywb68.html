people welcome to my channel I am
Patricia bright and how are you doing I
hope you oh well today I'm excited as I
always am and I'm about to do like
eyebrows skincare or a makeup video I
don't really know my bare face and
egghead is out for you guys to see in
the full effect and I'm gonna do a video
I'm trying a new product that I'm very
excited about especially it's a little
bit of her like me in the face of those
who are quite critical people who've got
you know acne or hyperpigmentation or
skin issues and they say it's because
they wear too much makeup I literally
hate that statement when people are like
your skin is bad because you wear too
much makeup no there's like hormones
it's genetics there's not drinking and
I'm a water there is stress there's
loads of different things that impact
people's skin and sometimes I'm just
like please keep your opinions to
yourself because you know I'm beautiful
in my own way and I don't need you to
come in have a super excited because
basically a brand that we all know and
love will kind of graduate towards and I
know them more for skincare I use the
cleansing balm to take off my makeup I
used a smart serum at night and I raved
about the even better skin tone
corrector for literally years for my
hyperpigmentation it works amazingly and
I know them more for skincare but
they've come out with the new foundation
called the even better glow and this
foundation makes some big boy claim it
claims to improve skin texture instantly
and over time it's meant to make your
skin more luminous it is meant to help
you with discoloration it's meant to
give you a glow and help with em
imperfections and I my trousers that's
something to me it sounds a bit like
almost like a foundation and a skincare
product because it contains things such
as vitamin C in it becoming e salicylic
acid
screen and basically it's got properties
that supposedly as you use it over time
your skin gets better so I was like all
right I gotta try this out so I'm gonna
apply this and see what I feel like it
looks like and I'm gonna try it out for
a couple of days I'm gonna report back
to you I actually went in and met up
with their global color pro so I'm gonna
put those clips in and then we're just
gonna get applying I'm here at florea
my name is for white I am a makeup
artist based in London but to have
around the world and I'm here today to
demonstrate the connect even better glow
foundation or even better glow so
whenever I am pretty much whenever I do
a job I always put at least four or five
colors on the back of my hand and I sort
of work them in I mean for a personal
use I use one shade each yeah but just
when I'm working on models or actresses
I put a few I don't use to start a bit
of blending and contouring and that was
the Sienna okay
and it just it really sinks into the
Skinner we're gonna click mirror to have
a closer look and you see you can see
the texture of your skin yeah which I
find very important I can even I can
tell now yeah I look very much like me
you just feel nice light on the skin
it's perfect that's great thank each
other yes
I have got that glow on I'm excited to
see you know how this is gonna wear yes
yes because of the properties in the if
you do have any issues concerned more
you use it yeah its enhancing your skin
the Susilo gas it is of exfoliating it
so pause can we become finer there's an
SPF in there so the more you use it
you'll see the benefits so meet it when
you use it you get the instant glow in
the average then underneath your skin is
being worked out so it's more more
benefits and that's really cool yeah
okay so we are back we are going to get
in as you saw I got a color match and
the shade that I this color match with
was Sienna we're going to mix that with
a touch of an bucks I'd like a little
bit more yellow as well I feel like
those will make a perfect combo it's
made it a little less red and this is
the brush from Clinique this was used on
me and honestly if I feel like I am a
convert to using brushes now I really
like the way brushes are like a prime
eye makeup okay okay so the coverage on
this is a medium to light coverage okay
that is giving me a row glow can you see
that it's like fluorescent hmmm glow oh
I was gonna do your gold this is go this
is really your gray oh blends in lovely
and as you can see we have some areas of
hyperpigmentation there which is
whenever I get a spot so we just know
we're gonna blend it out like it wasn't
even there I mean it is definitely a
glow formula sometimes is something that
I'm scared of as an as an oily girl and
I haven't applied any primer or anything
so yeah I do look radiant I feel like I
might powder it down
dust just a touch I want to see what
this really wears like by itself I feel
like the modern look nowadays is
actually a really radiant and glowy look
which has really been just everywhere
and I might as an oily girl don't run
away from that you know you just have to
just Pat it down a touch I'm gonna
finish the rest of my face put my
concealer and everything and then
I'll get back to you all right that's my
base and everything on there is no
powder on the foundation has definitely
got that kind of instant radiance and I
feel like I can see an element all right
blaring blaring to my skin like it does
definitely look a little bit like
airbrushed which I quite like and I feel
like I can feel that kind of pearl
iridescent because it's actually giving
me more of a neutral tone I'm gonna go
ahead and finish my face and see what we
look like at the air
okay so this is my finished look
yes I feel very um I do feel like you
know my face is got a kind of blur
effect going on although it is a light
to medium coverage I feel like I've got
a good amount of coverage that's what my
skin looks like um who else obviously
I'm actually have texture and that kind
of stuff which I feel like I've been
showing you guys a lot of recently but
overall I feel like it is kind of not
showing it as much and I didn't use a
primer as well so that is interesting
but realistically what we want to see is
how do those claims work out I'm gonna
wear this for the next couple of days
and I will get back to you and show you
my results Here I am without like camera
lighting and everything this is day one
after doing it myself and I must say and
it's pretty I'm doing a house day today
so nothing too strenuous but I'll report
back to the end of the day I'll show you
what did you have to say no but this
would be a good moment to check in
because at the end of the day I had
dinner grace is going down for bed
listen this is the beat from earlier on
today in it yeah it's not red it's
matched so end of day one lovin it Wow
okay this is day two wearing my
foundation
looks good I don't know if my skin seems
any better or not but it's only the
second day then out and out about doing
errands and all that jazz so yeah so far
so good
I love the way this foundation applied
it is quite a light foundation but it
can easily be built up but I will keep
you in the loop
okay so I am fat it's eaten time I'm
just looking in a mirror to see what I
look like this really stayed in place I
mean I've got a little jus and moisture
coming through which is relatively
normal but it's been raining today and
everything so and I've had a boozy
dinner I like it okay guys so today is
another day in my even bed glow
foundation and today I've got the globe
going today's a really cute day
good morning today is the day after
yesterday because I fell asleep didn't
fall asleep with my makeup on but I did
use a missile our cleanser and face is
looking flaky normally I'm a little bit
more like dehydrated and right you know
last night was a bit of a rough one so I
look alright in the morning then that's
okay okay your girl is back hello I have
to be honest of you I didn't wear it
consistently I wore it probably at least
four or five times but not every day
because I realized that putting on a
full face of makeup every day is kind of
a long of course I wore the foundation
as I was going and doing things that I
was doing and overall it definitely does
give me glow I feel like in the very
beginning I was looking you know glowy
on the verge of shiny but it wasn't a
shine that was by the end of the day you
looked insane it was more like a okay
I'm really glowy and my go continued to
her out the day maybe a little bit of
powder it's fine to just kind of DAB
down that glow but I did find that over
time it's like my skin got used to
wearing the foundation so I wasn't
producing as much oil so I didn't look
so oily which is nice it was kind of
like how your face gets used to skincare
it was how my face got used to the
foundation which I thought was quite
interesting love the color love love
love the color
I feel like CMO mixer the little bit
amber is like my perfect mix overall did
I feel like my skin looked better I
definitely feel like as I applied I
looked more radiant a hundred percent I
do feel like it had a really nice
blurring effect going on I feel like to
really see difference in your skin it
doesn't take for days it will take like
a couple of weeks of consistently doing
something did I feel like my
imperfections were diffuse of course
because I was wearing the foundation
really nice on and what I notice is that
it doesn't feel like I'm wearing
foundation feels like I'm wearing a
moisturizer well it's really nice
lightweight doesn't really move like
that I would really like that and I'm
just interested to see if I keep using
it if I would find improvement in some
of the issues that I have so large pores
and discoloration when I get spots and
when I scar because I have used like the
Clinique even better skin tone corrector
for when I had really dark marks and I
found it to be really useful and it
really really worked
I wondering if this has the same impact
over time because with that it took like
four weeks to see a difference overall
I'm a fan I am a fan I love Clinique and
the fan of the foundation we've got some
good shades going on right here let's
have a look I am not mad at it
and I like the way the finish looks and
I feel like this is just in there just
the modern glow the Milan go mano so
yeah that is my fall at first
impressions of the even better glow
foundation from Clinique ok guys thanks
