video is going to be on ways to wear
maxi dresses or kind of just the
different maxi dresses that you can have
so I hope you enjoy this video guys
first of my maxi dresses and this is
just the standard maxi dress which is
I've got this in a navy blue it's like a
cotton e material I bought this from
Vera Moda and this can sue everyone
the only things and if max sees is that
they really do cling to everything so
you really have to have a nice toned
body underneath or work out how you
learn to disguise your like how to your
lunch baby stuff like that but yeah this
is the first but my maxi dress is and
it's kind of fitted it's not too wide on
the bottom I don't necessarily think
that those shoot me
okay guys so this is for the braids for
those who don't mind wearing a big
pattern all fall over
so I love the floral looking stuff like
that and this is a tape on the floor
look it's a Paisley dress and it's a
Paisley maxi dress from Vera Moda Vera
mode I think it's a Norwegian brand but
they do have it here in the UK and right
it's another tape just to make the maxi
a lot more dramatic I really like it I
just feel very feminine and floaty in it
as well and it's another entity ID with
a pattern we actually can hide all of
your ugly bits like your fat stomach
your fat leg literally the pattern hides
all that so I don't have the holiday in
my stomach it's harder by word
need something else
so an alternative to the maxi dress is
the maxi skirt which is actually my
preference I love the maxi skirt I think
it's so feminine it's so pretty and just
as long as you get one that's athleisure
what's a movement
to wear any kind of tight cardboard and
based on the inside I feel really like a
lefty
and I picked this one up from
okay so this is actually not a magazine
nominee but it's the new kind of leg
which is called a MIDI it's just over
the knee and shows some leg but I think
it's a really
