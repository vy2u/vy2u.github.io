video is gonna be all about maximizing
your assets and assets I mean yes your
bum okay and if this is all about my
body shape you know I have think I have
a really nice curvaceous but still slim
at the same time but you know my top
half I'm just really lacking in that
department which you know doesn't bother
me is the wording created so it's really
all about maximizing what you do have
and just minimizing the things that you
don't like so much what I'm going to do
is show you you know just a range of
different jeans that I have and I
definitely think that they maximize your
assets and give you a really gorgeous
shape you don't actually have to have
you know the perfect bum for these these
actually create the illusion of having
what you don't actually out I'm going to
wear heels in all of all of these
because I love heels on jeans because it
kind of just makes it look that much
sexier and just dumb up and stuff like
that so let's get started
the first pair of jeans I'm wearing our
dark indigo denim and these are from
Topshop and I love indigo denim because
it creates the illusion of sleeveless
you can wear it all year round winter
spring summer autumn you know dark denim
is not going anywhere I love the high
waist is great and I love high-waisted
jeans because it cinches in your back
and cinches in your stomach I have quite
a big stomach and you know that kind of
takes me in a bit and when it takes you
in a bit it makes your curves even
curvier so it makes you kind of look a
little bigger on top especially when you
wear a top of volume in it that makes
your body bottom half look a lot more
curvier as well so as you guys know I
don't have heat I have a big bump I
don't have hips which is really really
strange
so yeah I love that so I'm wearing that
also with boob tube top and I love the
boot shoe tops for this season I just
love them I think they're really - I
think they're just very useful youthful
as well and you could buy these in Urban
Outfitters but I've actually just taking
the scarf and tie them up at the back
into a keep wait time and that is all I
did it's of a look at our next pair
actually from Topshop they are a
mid-tone denim they are still skinny
these are called their super skinny
jeans or their I don't know if it's got
a name but yeah they're called the
really skinny jeans I'll put the name in
the box and I just love these makes my
thumb perfect it's not no rise I hate
low-rise jeans I think they look really
tacky it's not really high-waisted jeans
but it's high enough and you can kind of
tell when you put them on when I can see
it coming close to my belly button those
are a perfect pair of jeans for me
though colored jeans make my bum that
really nice really curved and the skinny
fit just shows my shape a lot more but I
never get thin denim because it just
looks cheap you need they're really
thick and sturdy denim will you're gonna
wear skinny jeans like jeggings and
stuff I wouldn't wear jackets anymore
it's just tacky but that's just me I'm
wearing it with a balloony tight top
which is actually this top but what this
top does it kind of tucks in to it so it
creates an illusion of boobs and
illusion of volume on the top because of
the air that's within there as well as
still you can see my nice seeing curvy
body as well
so the final pair of jeans I'm wearing
on my actual Levi's jeans which I bought
recently and these are once again a
really skinny fit they were in enlight
denims and I love love love the light
denim for spring/summer is perfect I
kind of went in and got off the in for
the curve jeans trial in the bold which
is the size that I was told I wasn't
different Leopold and I like them on me
it didn't do anything for my universe my
asset as well and I didn't like that's
it but these pair these were a perfect
hair and what I said to them I want some
Ohio in the waist and very fitted and
these came perfect great and lovely I'm
wearing it with a crop swing top as well
as I love cops within tops because it
creates the illusion of volume where
there isn't any and then when you can
see a little bit of that and no bit of
stomach it makes you look smaller down
there and gives your curve if I'm gonna
wear jeans with anything crop tops long
tops short tops any jacket denim leather
fur just to look really cute so I hope
you enjoyed that video guys umm what
else you want to see let me know if you
want me to do a you know what's in your
wardrobe or something else I just love
your responses and
let's just get interactive so I can know
exactly what to do going on in the
future so thanks for watching guys I
twirl twist did do certain do something
don't gallop but you know how to babe
