just sent out an Instagram because I was
like haven't shot or recorded a video
for today right and I didn't put out a
video last week something either I've
been really lazy recently forgive me so
I thought okay what video can I do lots
of people are asking for the the nipi
product tag I might do that I thought a
favorite would be a good place to start
and also like chitchat catch up actually
cuz I'm not done one of those for a
really long time so I prefer having a
chat yeah and I'll do the lip product
tag probably in the next video because I
was tagged by Amelia and Estee and I was
tagged ages ago so I'm gonna definitely
do it so yeah and a lot of people asking
about my lipstick this is the lip stick
bag beware for ages it is the Karakoram
and it's a color called persistent which
is like ammo and then I've overlaid it
with one of my favourite products but
I'm going to grab that in a minute and
I'm gonna show you my favorites as well
as their and then we'll have a chitchat
okay alright get your cup of tea guys
get your cup of teas first things first
it is my oh my gosh this is clearly a
favorites because the writing has rubbed
off this is a mascara from Clinique I
don't even know what it's called
yeah this is a favor of mine because
it's probably one of the best mascaras
ever it genuinely make sure eyelashes
look really really long and thick and I
don't have like thick eyelashes actually
they're quite thick but they're quite
curly so I can't really get length but
this is definitely very lengthening and
very thick I another it is a favorite of
mine my next favorite is the Craig
Austin is the ultra sheer sunscreen it
is amazing you guys know that I'm
probably a bit crazy when it comes to
sunscreen and I went into space and Kay
and this is basically a liquid sunscreen
now for all my chocolate ladies and
we ladies who used to when they use
sunscreen has that blue jean this does
not have this doesn't leave you only
does not leave you greasy this is
amazing please look just look it's it's
literally like milk it's sick okay and
it rubs in and it just doesn't give you
that blue cast it's not an oil it's more
like it it's almost like using the
makeup removing stuff like that's what
it blends in like and I can just rub
that in but I can put my makeup on top
of this and it's actually fun and it's
basically SPF 50 UVA UVB broad-spectrum
this is my sunscreen of choice it is
about 35 pounds so it's quite expensive
but I basically only use this on my face
and I use it every single day and after
that I've been meaning to say this for
ages but it's my my tiny BER lipgloss in
exotic island now this is I've overlaid
this on the lipstick that I'm wearing
now but this is basically my go-to pink
lip gloss and I'm in lip gloss girl
because as she lips don't look so good
on me but this makes them look extra
extra good and the color is very very
pigmented so the days I might you know I
can't leave you bothered with makeup I
will just put this on my lips and it
looks really really good X is my
foundation the foundation I'm using is
the Lancome
it's the ultra 24 hours and the color
I'm wearing is the color 13 and this
foundation is the bomb like it's so so
good and it's very matte so for those of
you who have oily skin it definitely
mattifies and I find that the color is
very true to my skin tone and the one
thing that's funny I thought I was
initially a kind of 15 but I basically
did a hand test where I put the 15 on
put the 14 on for the 13 on went around
shopping came back to see that the 15
had oxidized significantly
and this one had oxidized to my right
color so initially it seemed like it was
quite light but it's blended in
perfectly by the way guys I'm sitting in
my living room which has got no
furniture in it right now because we are
redecorating so yeah if you wonder what
I am and this is like man I can share a
couple it's so pretty it's all springy
so I probably should do a Bobby Brown
haul video because I received a lot of
items from Bobby Brown and I haven't
showed them all yet something usable but
one of the products that is my absolute
favorite from everything that I got and
if you guys check out my Instagram
you'll see about how much I got I got so
many things that I've been doing videos
on the I love makeup channel so make
sure you check it out on thinking in the
description bar below so it's the brow
kit and it's in the sad dog mahogany
this bracket has literally transformed
my eyebrow game okay so the eyebrow kit
is amazing and when I saw this kid I was
like this is way too light but I like my
eyebrows to look really dark and
everything but when the makeup artist
put it on me it was literally flawless
the application was flawless
and you've got to use it with the
eyebrow angled brush it's like a really
coarse angle brush you pick it up on
that and you basically draw the lines
and blends it in please believe that
it's just giving me dream brows I'm so
excited to have like I'm so pleased and
happy with my eyebrows right now guys
okay and if you guys have struggled with
your eyebrow game this is gonna work for
you but you need a tweeze are those
accessor something something's next
favorite of mine is this scrunchie now
that I have been wearing my fringe and
everybody loves it but the issue with a
friend right it's a lot of hard work
that is what I found I found that the
greatest thing that I can do is
basically put the hair up you know
because you know if it's not kind of
organized correctly you just look crazy
and yeah and I literally just put this
scrunchie in which has got this really
nice detail to wear my hair up guys with
that little scrunchie just put a couple
of side hairs down and all of a sudden I
look nice up because the thing with the
fringe is that I don't know I find it a
bit overbearing on the face so will work
out so I'm gonna do the rest of the
video like this my GHD eclipse
straighteners ladies and gentlemens if
you want some good straight news you
need to go GHD or you need a go home
these are so thick like they're so so
amazing they straighten your hair really
well and like I have a plugged it in but
even the sound it makes it makes me feel
like I'm in the salon it's like vinegar
look it tells you when it's at the
perfect temperature and it's just really
nice oh and for those of you who like to
color your hair as well
please believe you can genuinely get
create some really nice curls or loose
waves just using these straighteners
about getting that jaggedy that kind of
crimped look I find that this has gives
you the perfect kind of grip to
basically create really smooth curls and
this 12 as well so that way you are
doing that it's not going to twist up
amazing ingenious pair of straight nerds
I don't know what I've been doing
without them I'm glad I have them my new
babies so I want to just show two
eyeliners one is the Revlon Colorstay
liquid liner so I'm always on the hunt
for the perfect liquid liner it is a
struggle out here guys it is a struggle
but this is a very good liquid liner and
it gives you nice jet black eyes and
it's got a felt tip and that's what I
really like about it the felt tip is
nice and chunky and it's hard it's not
one of those flimsy brushes it's very
hard and yet gives you a really nice
wind eye and I'm absolutely loving Urban
Decay they're all night liner this
iodine art is
real again since I've been wearing the
fringe and stuff I find that I'd like to
have my eyes look really really like
striking this is what I'm using this is
literally just given me the boldest eyes
and it lasts all day all night it's
really really good and finally it's my
Tom Ford lipstick you guys are seeing me
wearing it a lot this is my lipstick it
is called deep me it's a beautiful
beautiful nude for all skin tones for me
it just makes my lips look so kinda
explain exactly just dogs hick Widow and
finally it's got to be sad miss album
and his album I've been listening to
every single day since last week was
it's Monday when it came out it is
actually so so good and there's a track
on it called restart right I might
actually have to do a little dance right
of me when I just wanna raise them
actually I am walking to work like a
crazy woman because it gives me this Bop
like it gives me this special walk
that's like yeah yeah restart it's
Monday we start like the album is just
nice to hear a good vocal album I feel
like you don't find like vocal artists
anymore and I just think he's amazing I
just love his voice a long way of my
favorite favorite artist which is
actually daily his eighth album is on a
point if you guys like vocalist that
he's an amazing vocalist and that album
days and nights is sick I'm gonna both
of them in the description bar below so
you guys can check it out I feel like
I've just done a chitchat now with this

chitchat but I think then we do a quick
chit chat then quick chit chat

other people's blogs and just enjoying
it the process of art and creation and

with be a as well so we will do the
floors and one thing people are ask us
or not is why we don't vote blog very
much but we both work so we both have
jobs so I don't know if you want me to
vlog in my offices but that's not going
to be happening because I hope data
protection and so yeah I'm not blocking
and the issue is right I'm tired
you know when I'm leaving the house at
7:30 in the morning
vlogging is the last thing on my
priority list and you know Michael works
a full-time job as well and obviously
there's no way he's and that's a blog
even close to what he does as a career
and you know we just really enjoy our
private time but we genuinely do also
love doing the youtubers sharing with
you guys so I don't know maybe we'll try
and do like a once a week vlog let me
just summarize little things we've done
in the week if it's worth sharing with
you guys and maybe we do one like vlog
day in the week but it's hard for the
people who can vlog regularly I told you

excited dude in fact this is what
happens when I'm in a good mood right

crazy day for me yeah but I'm going to
