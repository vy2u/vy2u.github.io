[Laughter]
I was a good resource in my hair one day
with my long today I got me that I would
mean what do you guys think of me I
can't admit I was just caught all again
this is the Patricia Webb found that he
just became don't know I think I have
spent more time with you to start just
like oh why man I met you now oh it was
a bigger cause we'll be in the pink room
oh yeah she was really like in public
like you do quite remember beneath us
what was your favorite memory together
one of the good one is my 17th birthday
my first I have fun we just moved into
that house and then it was white hood it
was very well room and as all kinds of
drama was just going on in the house and
when Mom was in the house serving people
biscuits or ministry about that when
when when it got too dramatic my dad
came down benefit everybody and
everybody I think basically just
embarrassed me a very much like a Sean
Paul video when I didn't know exactly
like that video so wedding and they
don't weapon yeah yeah I would you find
me
it was amazing from the beginning like
how we all got together away two men
father survived a mic is not working
gotcha I have not been able my wife is
all she was diamond right right and I
will you picking me up and apologize the
next day's oh I'm so sorry I'm looking
those particularly nice dress yeah you
don't want to be late for the wedding
you've got to the wedding and you start
to cry and describe each other in one
word
whoa in-car energy Maureen Maureen in
one word study how come like a brick but
okay okay
money in know I need the work dazzle
maybe also discuss her as juggle oh good
I don't want money keeps the next like
she drinks her name is Vanessa happy
yes finish she describing you a shop
like who are we describing me I'm trying
to prove something about the ones that
you you and you're talking yeah
definitely yeah he's very yeah yeah I
want to clean military with no
mathematics operation vital fun I run
run quite straight to the point
oh yes and also quite can be oblivious
oh yeah
right at the ferry
yes mystery items that you guys always
carry or each other we carried with them
right so Monique will be mobile phone
maker I went out on your get out another
night out loud
go ahead you have no one it has one car
nothing
Michael will be carrying everything all
the time you have two big community
nothing nothing
I want a grated sock do never have IP
this cowl-neck one has her ID we've been
to many a places oh do you mean ID what
is the definition of a good friend I
think the definition of good friend is
someone that you can tell your secrets
to or your feelings or acres going on in
your life and they don't judge you no
you don't do an honest opinion yeah and
I think that's why our friendship has to
stay for so long because yeah we've
always been honest to each other whether
or not like we do agree
what are you could as many times that we
haven't agreed to be tougher in terms of
what's been going on but we had each
other well black and I don't
think you to be with that guy I know
that what he did in fun but we've let
the person write it out and I mean I
love them so then we have microphone
next up then I was well someone that you
can be really vulnerable with when I
show any type of way yeah and now you
just get on and I think we have is
everybody has seen the good the bad and
I
yeah well that's true when did you
realize your girlfriend's have become
your closest friend how been quite
pinnacle happens and then we just and we
had each other's back that day Princeton
oh yeah I kind of feel that benign yeah
we weren't rowdy teenagers no babe but
ya know the moment where the girls who
had my back our clothes yeah and I think
from then everyone was like yes everyone
had each other's brat and I kind of just
felt that also will known just like a
closed unit I thought at my truth test
between me and you
when Samara mama died oh yeah but I was
bad for you
yeah like imma go and I called her like
my government just dyin
yeah yeah he's got on that 450 but no no
very much in my hospital in like 20
minutes
yeah that's so true yeah you're not
going to have to be the creep if you do
the Longwood
together for good Dean oh yeah oh I
don't know that how do you maintain a
strong bond as a group while you're each
growing and creating your own life
that's actually quite a good question so
the other thing I think we've recently
been discussing I feel like the part of
it is that actually older you have to
understand that your friends and have
their own life yeah man so just because
they're not sticking to everyday doesn't
mean they're your friends exactly not I
mean I think it's just understanding
Aaron Utley where we're all very
ambitious women we know that everyone
wants to wear the part of your month to
go to know we're very supportive of each
other
yeah and I think I just don't know I
think it's colorful you never went their
own separate ways but we always come
back together
that is a teacher Annihilator yeah
wonderful I'm not
- chat - but you've got places to go
people to see darling have you guys ever
fallen mouth argued and housing queue
over company no no there so all of us
including money and Natalie we've never
had a falling out we can share opinions
another person might not agree but it's
never a feature it's never enough um I
know tell each other about themselves it
is very bright for your eyes you know
okay Oh Q&amp;amp;A question how can you tell
when a guy isn't right for your
girlfriend
good question Wow sometimes I go on and
I think looking from the outside in
it's a lot easier to be someone's flaws
mm-hmm so you might be able to identify
someone who you don't think is right for
your friends but more than or not you
have to allow the friend to actually
experience it and see it for themselves
yes because until you get that Eureka
moment I'm telling you love is blind
you will continue to be through those
relativity laughing no matter what
people's and the behavior isn't every
single one of us every single one of our
and the rest of great suggestion I
assume this one they're good men is it
again really me mother
Zumaya puppeteer well for up okay this
