wait and how was Patricia in school hmm
fire fire fire fire no she was very good
no tell the trainer all right tell the
chief either at school yeah tell the
brothers were very good yeah but she has
a clique yeah in primary school your
notes so let's do it in primaries read
what was I like a secondary school and
in secondary school you guys sit good
but I'm and make sure your friends in
the morning before they go to school
they'll come to our house mmm
and I look at them from the dough so but
you are a big fan of some of my friends
yes if some of them they know that if
they are not
behavior
I will let it be I'll make sure I speak
to them and say from today you know
Patricia's friend go away don't Konya
you remember the time you and you were
having trouble in school we did you know
the time did teach on this channel said
we should come to school when you said
this girl is established she doesn't
know it
yeah I remember that times remember they
say say - she doesn't know she's playing
she's you know and I said two days
Patricia come home
ah but then I remember the teacher used
to call like every day - like report on
my behavior for you but but they the
complaint was that you are such a star
but you don't know it you're playing
you're following the wrong crowd but the
good thing about it is after maybe when
we sat down together the teachers myself
and you after the talk I think you go
home and take you serious you come back
wanting to say you know what I'm gonna
change I made a change in that year 10
you did you remember that I don't mean a
big time your way I got father to be bad
yes yes like when you went to six foam I
didn't want you to go to and what
college college no I knew if you go to
college too much freedom and college
will not do you good
as I said no Patricia we must go to six
four versus form is still like one
second with school did you want the
teacher to control everything yes and
that's where you met all your most of
your good friends to me as I'm
intimately Inca unique Mecca the brother
yes I think that was you're talking to a
turning point in your life what would
you change if you could raise Butchie
again what would you change if you could
raise me again I'm not God yes
but if you could change anything what
would you change not really we can say
you want to change somebody because you
are not good God has made you who you
are and if your see Patricia you're
Patricia that's nice yeah I don't want
to change it your Patricia you see
lovely last question although I don't
really know how relevant it is but
describe Patricia's perfect type of guy
like perfect man here I go we got my
shoe yeah Patricia is hot very I don't
know I don't know where you got that
correct ah so micros it come person I
think God God knows what it does by you

gold so because if you if you have to
fire fire they need to be double fire so
you must have fire uncle so that is good
