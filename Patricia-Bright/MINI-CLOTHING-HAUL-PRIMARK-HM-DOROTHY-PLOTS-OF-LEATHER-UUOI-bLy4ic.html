video is going to be a haul please
forgive my forehead which is like awful
the fringe is not good for my skin
literally broken out all over my
forehead and like oh my god
no more fringe but I'm going to do a
haul I've it's kind of like a collective
oh I've got quite a few bits and bobs
political so I'm a bit of a Primark fan
but not like the biggest Primark fan I
let go irregularly and 90% of my
wardrobe is not Primark like something
but yeah I mean in there recently and
found these most amazing shoes and these
are in my k and blue suede and like I
really like them because of what they
looked really expensive and it's a
really chunky chunky heel and it's quite
a cute you know front here it's quite
different and I just like the high and
the chunkiness of the hill I think this
is really in trend and actually quite
like blue long so it ended up ended up
buying these boots here and you know the
same of me I always wear heels because
of the size of my feet which you guys
know and I never wear heels that are not
high but for some reason these look good
of me they didn't make my feet look too
long or too massive as I and their ankle
boots and they're cute and they actually
are quite well made it feels quite well
made the only annoying thing is that the
thread the thread that they've done it
in is white what what why would you do
that and the black boot come on but
easily to just get some shoe polish and
like yeah I ended up getting this Union
Jack top as well
uni and Jack power to the people
jacket and I've also got it in this grey
color as well and I don't know how I
just liked it I felt a bit nostalgic and
I think with that the pair of leather
shorts or something like that you can
kind of I don't know harden it up and I
thought that was lovely
I also got this top here with the birds
on it now you guys have seen my motif
video and I just thought the motif on
this is so cute and the the way that
this fit is really nice with like
leather leggings guys you'll see I've
got like a sick obsession with leather
all of a sudden could be a fetish
who knows yes but and yeah this is quite
summer in everything but blazer up
everything bad but also got this bad
from Primark which I liked
all right there kind of granny view and
it's really large on the inside there's
a lot of room for you to put a lot of
stuff in there now what I do hate is
this like Prime update they hit it and
then they miss it no why why did you do
that but it's gonna easily be taken off
you can cut the thread and this will
come off so that is I also bought the
bangles which are in leather of fur
leather and what I liked about it is
that it's studded but the studies I like
rose gold now I've got the cause in the
gold but I'm getting the coat cause in
the rose gold yes I am yeah I am and I
just loved it cuz I hate but I hate
bright gold and just obvious things well
this is like rose gold and it wasn't all
shiny and veiny and awful and I was like
yes then I also got these tights which
were like they look really good on the
mannequin and I like striped tights can
you imagine those under pose shorts
leather ones are really big who is it
and then other than that I went to H&amp;amp;M
and I bought some leather leggins
oh my gosh fetish has arrived
yeah but they're like they're not even
might never leathers and wallet leather
trousers with like 11 leather legging
fabric on the side there's v's here
house phone so sorry yeah just talk
about these and had the leg in fabric on
the side there's no pockets or anything
but it makes my bum look juice a bit too
juicy my husband may not be happy with
that I will be wearing long coats of
this and yeah these are only 14 pounds
I've got them in a size 10 you will need
them and they're bigger size cuz this
stuff is like Oh your skin bought my
dream yes I bought a dream in terms of
the leather skirt
now I don't know
three something like this it shouldn't
look like a little shakedown
you can't I have I am plastic it but
yeah it's the leather skirt and it's
like the kind of rah-rah shape as well
and what I really like about it is
because I literally seen these in Zara
for 70 pounds but hey two names done
well and getting the style really right
and fetish is my thing and is like the
new thing this season and stuff and
Phillips metallics are also gonna be
really big as well and I saw HR HR h
collection channel is good channel is
glorious and she had this jump on and
I've seen it I'd seen in the shop and I
said really really sort on her but yes
really
so and a boy this is it and I'm gonna
have an outfit of the day with this and
like you're gonna do a pairings of this
and leather like and night and day
outfits as well and this was 25 pounds
it's like painted on is well I finally
my by like my buy of the month it's not
my buy of the year you have a drumroll
please or some kind of song it's this
white blazer no you didn't go and do a
blazer in white with black lapels this
is like a dream this is a dream blazer
to me I've always always wanted a white
blazer but I can never find a nice
fabric or anything like that but this is
just like I wish you could see it's like
high quality but look at that look at
the twill in there twin and then the
buttons the buttons then the pearls and
everything and it fits so well it's a
really really gorgeous jacket and I feel
quite lucky to have got that and I got
that from Dorothy Perkins you imagine
Dorothy Perkins they're really stepping
their game up and that was fifty quid
and that is it is my whole I think
that's gonna be my last hole with my
only haul in September and yeah that's
it so thanks for watching guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
