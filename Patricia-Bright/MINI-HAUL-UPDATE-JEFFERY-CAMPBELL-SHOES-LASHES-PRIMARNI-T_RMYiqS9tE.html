halt and kind of like a mini life update
and stuff because I might cop dating you
of what's going on but should I be date
you first or hook now call first so it's
the most random whore and it only
includes some stuff that I got online
some stuff from debenhams or yeah we'll
just go through it we don't need to tell
you what it is you'll see so I thought
I'll quickly discuss my Geoffrey
Campbell's but i got from shop and crea
calm its think it's a cut shopping
California and they have loads of
different shoes and stop and I wanted a
pair of Jeffrey Campbell's for a while
but the liters I found I win then almost
bought them I just felt that they look
like clown shoes just didn't like them
at all of the kind of the style of it
just wasn't me and then I saw these I
was like oh these are me these are
Jeffrey Campbell's than me they're very
feminine but still quite edgy at the
same time especially with the the
platform and everything and the glitter
glitter for christmas is just perfect
and what I would definitely say that
they're extremely like scaring me
comfortable why would a high he'll be
very comfortable but they're really
really comfortable and I was actually a
bit nervous about the liters being
uncomfortable but I'm presuming they are
extremely comfortable like these are
neither 119 dollars not entirely sure
how much shipping to the UK was what I
don't think it was more than 10 20
pounds and this is these shoes so i
ended up found out about this website
where you website this ebay account
where you can get loads and loads of
eyelashes and i think you get 60
different pairs or 1 2 3 4 5 6 i've got
another two boxes 60 pair of lashes for
like seven pounds so that's like a one
pound 20 / 10 lashes it's really good it
took about two weeks to come and I've
got selection of different one so you've
got like really thick dramatic lashes
that look nice on a night out you've got
the ones that I'm wearing are like more
a more natural looking one you just got
a good varieties and it's so cheap and
then they're really good the bands are
quite thin some I found were a bit thick
which I don't like that
most of them are thin bands so you guys
know I told you I'm about to step up my
makeup game and I'm good at this and I'm
investing so I ended up buying this
naked palette that I've seen so much
everybody is doing with using it and
everything and I just thought you know
let me go pick it up it's a nude palette
and for someone like me who doesn't like
dramatic colors and stuff and I just
like neutrals then this is perfect for
me you just get a variety of different
neutrals really i think the funny thing
is that i have so many of these kind of
Cutler's which i want to show you but
still you know it's a good idea just to
get more is it and it's a lot cheaper
than mac when there's the variety of the
colors that you get in this palette and
you also get a little primer potion
tests are basically but i also bought
the primer potion by itself by itself as
well and so i think this is like 14
pounds and this was 35 pounds so i went
to Primark and i got some bits and bobs
there i bought this jumpsuit which is it
jump to place it blah blah blah you guys
saw it in my previous video and it's
this stars on this jumpsuit and i really
like it it's really feminine and girly
but sometimes i may just want to wear it
as a top versus you know whole big
yellow outfit i could just throw on
another skirt like a plain black skirt
on top of this and just mix it all up so
this is really cool and that was only
like i think it was like 13 14 pounds
the rest of the stuff is kind of boring
but still cute at the same time so i'm
really trying to invest in my work
wardrobe so i bought this shirt here and
I thought it's quite smart but still
fashionable at the same time and it's
got a little bow that you kind of we're
done a bit middle very very poor she and
I think and that was like 10 pounds at
promo I'm ups getting these prices up
something like this used to be like six
pounds should get excited and again for
work i bought this pleated skirt but
this to me is not just a work skirt this
is like
for any losses right nice and its really
really thick and I think because
christmas has come in it's got a little
bit of sparkle in it but then if you can
tell that and I thought this is really
nice for work just to walk around and
everything and you guys know I'm like
not the most masculine a person that
pair people and I don't really wear much
denim but I bought these denim trousers
and I don't think I like the shape of
them they're too masculine for me but
they'll probably get returned but some
people like them and they look amazing
on my sister really making my sister
okay so based on my last video you guys
gave me loads and loads of suggestions
for like holidays and stuff like that
I'm all for the honeymoon and I finally
kind of picked a destination and we will
be going to Kenya and we'll be going to
Mombasa hopefully we've not put the
money down yet but we should be going to
Mombasa for like a safari honeymoon like
on the coast just quiet BTW location and
I think our options were over the
Caribbean Asia or Africa we still
haven't been to look I have not been to
the Caribbean and Mike's not been to
Asia but we both been to Africa before
but we thought you know this is a
different part that we've never been to
and it would be really really nice just
to you know see what it's going to be
like so I should make triangle eyes and
pictures of what could be like but I
don't notice I'm excited about that now
also we have like n a website because oh
well it's in the process of coming up
now because I've actually had so many
messages of people who want to send me
gifts and wedding gifts and I might I
can't believe how generous people
actually I think that's crazy like
because not everyone knows him in
everything and even when I went to
Singapore and ago I met out there
already had a lovely lovely wedding gift
for us house it's like oh my gosh how
sweet is this so we're going to give
people the option if you wanted to see
our gift pneus and stuff you can have a
look it up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
