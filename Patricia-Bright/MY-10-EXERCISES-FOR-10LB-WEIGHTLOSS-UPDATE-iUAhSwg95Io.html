you my diet and fitness routine I've
been wanting to update you guys on the
whole process of my whole 10 pounds in 3
months and I have been progressing okay
I had a little bit of a blip and back in
like end of January and stuff but I have
reason my kitchen was being done but I
thought I'd share with you one that my
little workout routine that I'm doing
and basically I just do like really
intense like resistance training and
exercises for 30 seconds I take a break
for 20 seconds and I do another exercise
and I do them all and then I do them
again like three to four times and
probably I spend about twenty to thirty
minutes doing it and it's really great
like muscle muscle building exercise
which is great calorie burners and it
can really get your heart rate going as
well so it's a great workout so I'll
show you that but I thought I'll talk
about my my whole diet regime as well
because one of the key things I've
learned recently is that it's probably
90 percent diet to losing weight like
exercising is nice but I actually think
that to be able to see the work of your
hands or the work of your exercise you
need to get rid of the fat and get rid
of all the like bad eating that
basically gets hides all the muscle that
you've got going on underneath there
health and fitness and the perfect body
is 80% diet and I like my food girls I
like my food but and I've worked out
ways to make it much easier for me and I
don't believe in eating less and what
okay I shouldn't say that I don't
believe in like being hungry like
starving yourself but I believe in
eating more of the right foods and less
of the bad food so I have probably one
of the most simplest diets now ever why
try to have the simplest eyes ever but I
basically start off my morning with
porridge and it's porridge every day no
milk no sugar it's kind of boring but
you know that's just how I start off my
day so I have a snap now if I get hungry
or peckish or anything like that I
literally I go and eat through I have an
apple I have an orange I have
and I have all three and I feel a lot
better or I have like a carrot or a tin
of sweet corn like rather then snacking
on a packet crisps or whatever just eat
the fruit be really fooled up but be
filled up with healthy things then for
lunch I've decided that well because of
the whole kitchen situation I kind of
learned that guilt grilled vegetables
and grilled meat or fish is great like
it's so quick George Foreman grill and
then for dinner
I'll have something like what would I
have something like again a grilled
piece of meat or good piece of meat lots
of veggies and then a little bit of rice
or a little bit of potato on the side I
won't lie like I seem to love potato
more like more than ever liked it before
but I have some potato or yam or sweet
potato and I do to make my veggies nicer
I basically splatter them with hot sauce
like hot salt as vegetables and
basically that's how I'm just eating
healthier and I'm hoping that I can
definitely lose more than 10 pounds so
my goal is to get to eight and a half
stone so I'll see if I can get there
I've currently calmed down to nine - so
I say it's about nine - I don't know
when this video is going to go up but as
of today I am 92 and I started off at
nine six so that's great it's working so
I'm going to get to it and I'm going to
show you some my workouts if you're not
following my blog it's Patricia bright
coat UK make sure you check me out there
I'll have a lot more stuff over there I
love you and I'll see you guys later bye
but the first one is squats it's my
favorite one because it means that the
booties gonna be looking good hopefully
so the next one I'm going to do is kind
of like a skiing movement and it's great
for your butt muscles as well
so another really good next one is
jumping squats you will be burning after
you do this after 30 seconds but they
are really reading so that's I'm going
to do some jumping lunges which are
really good for the legs and can get yet
really out brushes off but you doing
them so there's a four good leg
exercises again do them for 30 second
stop for 10 to 20 seconds dealing for 30
seconds just make sure you push yourself
and do them so this is a really easy one
if you don't have weights I have no
weights or anything like that but you
can basically use a towel like a small
table this is going to be but to use as
resistance what you do pull it is hard
you can and you basically put it out and
push it back as much as you can and pull
really really tight and you can squat
while you're doing it as well
so next I'm going to do press up I use I
literally hated hated hated hated press
retailers have kind of the weakest arms
you've ever seen and I was literally not
able to do one but the more I do it I
can kind of get like ten or so down well
a great thing to do is to keep your legs
and your knees on the ground and you
don't have to go all the way down so you
start with your knees bent but you're
making it harder you can stretch your
legs basically up a bit more you just
did this is an exercise that I hate it's
the prime but to be totally honest it is
one of the best cortex ER sizes you can
probably do beyond this abuse a some of
you guys should know it you get yourself
on your elbows your looks up and you
really want to keep your back as low
down as you can and hold for as long as
you can let's see how long I can hold
so the next one is mountain climbers
they're a great way to see how your
strength is improving when I first
started I could literally only do three
of these in 30 seconds if that but now I
can do probably about 1020
you're not going to count this time this
is just a demonstration so what you
gonna do it's kind of like a plank again
and then you basically lift your legs up
but you you're up basically we did but I
let them the move show you what happened
to Philemon
basically keep your head up and just
move our legs out like this it's kind of
like cycling so guys thank you so much
for watching I really hope that you
enjoyed as I said I'm not a professional
but I thought I'll share with you some
of my exercises that I do on my fitness
journey and basically if I can do it
anyone can do it so guys make sure you
check out my blog
Patricia bright coat UK and I'll see you
guys later
that actually hurts keep going might
just keep going I say just chill out you
know you only live once okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
