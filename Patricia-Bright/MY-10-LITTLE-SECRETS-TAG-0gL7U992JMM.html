little secrets tag and I was tagged by
Sonny Thank You Sammy for tagging me and
I rarely ever do tags but I saw this one
I was like I really wanted to do this
one so I'll just get started with the
questions
of course I should have thought about
this beforehand but product I would have
to say Vaseline now this is so bad huh
like if you have ashy lips you're just
not gonna look good but as long as your
lips look moisturize and you've got a
bit of glow going on on you you're gonna
look better than looking dry and crusty
especially not your lips so Vaseline
would have to be that product
my skincare secret is to not necessarily
wash your face with cleansers every
single day now this sounds really weird
but I for someone like me I've got
combination skin but I think I'm on the
drier side I found that when I what I
cleanse my face every other day and it
was really really useful and it really
had a really nice skin when I was doing
that and then it depends if I wearing
like lots of makeup then I'll have to
cleanse
my haircare secret has to be natural
oils literally if I don't have anything
but I've got a bit of water I've got Bev
oil I'm good to go
grapeseed oils avocado oil avocado oil
that much see almond oil these oils are
really cheap you can actually buy them
by the liter and I buy my liter bottles
of natural oils and put them in little
pots and I find that that's a great way
with moist with water and oils you've
got great hair and you can wash it out
use them for treatment anything all
those are just amazing
I don't really diet but I have notice I
gained weight as you could tell my
head's a little fatter but it would be
definitely just eating smaller portions
for someone like me I love food I love
fatty food I love rice mmm I love all
that kind of stuff but what I tried to
do is to minimize my portions because I
literally heap like I have a heap
mountain of rice and like four phases of
chicky and if I could go half the amount
of rice half the amount of chicken then
I'm in a better position and there's no
point in suffering yourself just try and
eat small portions
so working out tips would definitely be
for those of you who hate working out is
to walk and if you walk walk faster then
you'd normally walk because the main aim
of exercise is to increase your heart
rate and if you walk very very fast you
are actually gonna burn more calories
because you're increasing your heart
rate if you hate exercising I hate
exercising but I love walking so power
walking is a great way to kind of
exercise in the night Society really
I'll say it'd be my natural scent it
would be Britney Spears fantasy I told
you guys this every time but enough
caramely smells and my quite sweet
smells and that's a really really sweet
smell but I love my most treasured piece
of joy
obviously that's gonna have to be my
wedding ring my engagement ring
obviously because
now obviously I'm not interested every
Tuesday I know we don't really care
about celebrities very much I'm
definitely into like what I see around
me or what I see in the shops like
that's the stuff that inspires me if I
have to pick an individual or have to be
on YouTube it would be style Susie
because I just love it just looks
gorgeous he's just amazing so she's like
one of my favorite YouTube youtubers
definitely and I'm not that kind of
sleek starsin yeah
I actually probably only wear makeup
when I'm doing YouTube videos very very
surprising and that's because in the
morning I'm just lazy literally I just
wash my face moisturize sunblock and I'm
good to go I can't be bothered to do my
face sometimes I do always take a makeup
bag with me because I might do my makeup
on the train if I have the energy and if
I'm going out after work
so I drain your makeup and people you
see me like oh you put princess there
kind of like Oh what happened to you
yeah and wake up
oh yeah that's a little bit of a secret
it's not really a secret anyway guys
thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
