Week and created some looks for eBay and
I was very much inspired by all the
fashion but I saw there and thought I'd
create an autumn look book for you guys
so for this first look here I was
inspired by the kind of monochrome trend
that I saw everywhere lots of people
love black and white and I love this
dress because it combines black white
and grey in a beautiful floral print so
I just topped off this look with the
couple of hard leather accessories that
my shoes and my bad just to make it look
so good
the next I saw a lot of hair accessories
and when it's windy and raining like it
was they're so handy from cat ears and
fascinators I chose to wear a vintage
scar and run
they're really cool way and I think it
just set off a really plain outfit
so next it's got to be my favorite you
guys know I love leather in all
different types of ways and I saw about
a lot from skirts to obsessing Lisa
jacket the whole shebang and my nervous
going anywhere
so next it's about the standout piece
and in this circumstance
it was a standout jacket I wore this and
it's kind of gypsy huge circuses and I
just love it because it really did stand
out I love the colors and the prints and
everything that you can wear something
in a plane
so guys that's the end of my little
Fashion Week inspired lookbook I hoped
you enjoyed and I will see you later
thanks for watching guys so make sure
you check out my blog moments at Starcom
where I've got a lot of my looks already
