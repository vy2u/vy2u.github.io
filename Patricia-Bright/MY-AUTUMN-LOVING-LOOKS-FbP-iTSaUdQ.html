today I thought I put together a video
for you which is basically a little
trends that I'm enjoying for autumn so
the first wonderfully trendy item I'm
wearing in an umbrella that is because
it's always raining in England but
besides that you know I'm wearing
leather and peppermint's and starts and
also maroon being one of the lovely
autumn colours I'm wondering if the work
there is like this everywhere so I don't
get too jealous of those who are in the
sunshine
so I'm embracing the red colors a lot
more the darker Reds the Maroons and
here I'm only a red dress from Zara with
a blazer from H&amp;amp;M just accessorizing
with other colors like rose gold and
some Browns and textures to add to make
them look
so guys this is my favorite look of all
the looks I love this shot it's been
shot from Ramadan it's got lace on the
cast and on the collar
it's just sexy with leather and some
high heels
now talking in the front of the ship and
in the back and uncover the behind
so again I'm loving grays and stars for
an autumn looking you can find clothing
with studying on it as well and just
leather it's just always got that
feeling to me my jumper or sweater is I
love you call it is from Topshop and my
waistcoat is from a love of clothing on
it absolutely amazing guys
so another great thing I'm loving for
autumn is basically you've added a touch
of glamour with some fur
obviously faux fur guys and it's just
gorgeous just to add layering with denim
shirts and vests and leather jacket I
think it's very ordered
this was just a quick even looked I
threw together but I had the green the
red the starts are just putting
everything into it basically but it
definitely means right
so guys what was your favorite look and
I know I don't do not look but I will
aim to do more you guys want me to so
let me know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
