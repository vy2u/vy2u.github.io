an absolutely huge collective haul and I
have a feeling it's gonna be really long
so I'm gonna say right now just stop
right get a cup of tea some biscuits and
just Park yourself or you know where
you've got some time watch this video
because it is going to be long I really
apologize but I've got so much stuff
this has been like last month and this
month it's just so much stuff and I've
been gifted with a lot of things but I
want to definitely make sure that I
cover and but yeah let me know though if
you guys like long or big collective
hauls like this or if you prefer like me
to show you four or five items as and
when I buy them so just leave a comment
below so I know for for the future but
today is definitely going to be
collectible so first of all I've got
some goodies some prime up no it's a
penis I don't actually go to Primark
very often and when I do I quite enjoy
it but not when you go regularly so I'll
just stop talking and show you what I've
got first of all I picked up some tights
they're sheer tights they're two pound
fifty and I love this like in the autumn
I always wear like sheer tights and
usually about 15 Danny I like the kind
of see-through look some girls hate it
but I love it and then I picked up this
jumper here or some may say sweater and
it's coming up a bit brighter than it is
it's more like a dark maroon red
absolutely gorgeous
Raunak Raunak is my new thing and it's
got the buttons here absolutely lovely
the colours lovely and this is only 5
pounds so I picked up some just some
what they called ballot Bret ballet
pumps and they were only again four
pounds because I wear flat shoes to work
and I wear my studded Topshop shoes and
sometimes I'm in the office and I've
walked in and I completely forget that
I'm wearing those shoes and walk around
the office who've studied Topshop shoes
people are looking at me like I'm crazy
and I'm like okay fine let me wear these
so if I do get tired feet in your face I
can just put these on and I'm pleased so
I've developed an obsession for like
barbar what's it called Barbour bod body
warmers but I didn't want to get a
bobble one I just picked up one from
Primark and he
it's actually a navy-blue I know it's
coming up quite strong their brakes and
they dark maybe blue actually and then
it's got the brown bits of suede on it
and I also picked up one in the classic
car key color can you imagine this with
a leather coat underneath it fabulous
Oh another thing I'm also obsessed with
are tennis shoes these are the dark navy
as well but I know they're coming up
really blue on the camera and these are
only full pounds I really like them and
it's got the white sole and it doesn't
have any laces but I don't mind I think
these look lovely with jeans and just
casual look and then I picked up this
jumper here I don't know if you can see
the details on it I might pull it a bit
back hopefully it's not too bright
it's kind of crochet kind of knitted
jumper so next I will move on to things
that I was gifted this is from love
clothing calm it's an absolutely huge
bunch of stuff and they let me basically
pick anything I wanted and I just went
quite wild on the website and I
absolutely love it I will link it below
and all of the items on link below so
first of all it is this a mustard one
piece culottes outfit and it's actually
from motel for their box inside it's
actually from whoopsie it's actually
from motel and it's like a halter neck
and then the back of it has got this
hole in it and it's culotte absolutely
gorgeous my absolute favorite I love
leather I love leather coats I just love
it and they had this jacket here it's an
absolutely gorgeous softest leather ever
real leather and it's got like draping
bottoms so it kind of hangs loosely from
me really really gorgeous and it's got
like stretch on the sleeves as well I
also got this gray dress it looks a bit
blue on camera not sure why but this
gray dress and I've said I know things
that drape and round necks and this
dress has got it all all in one and it
looks gorgeous with the jacket sorry
that this is really creased it's been in
a box for ages I'm like struggling with
all the stuff I've got to find places to
put them now okay so it's this contrasts
long drapey t-shirt absolutely hard
love it it's kind of half black half
white it's all white soy cream scream at
the back and just lovely very soft as
well so you guys I think would love this
so they do basically customized Levi's
shorts so you pick the design that you
want in your shorts so I picked polka
dots and they will customize a pair of
vintage Levi's shorts for you and I
picked this design here in the dark bled
up in the dark denim but they've got
loads of different ones and the only
issue is that this is a little bit too
small for me so anybody who's a size
eight to six or maybe on the smaller
size the probably a smaller behind than
me if you want it just leave a comment
below and I'll just pick my random org
and give someone these pair of shorts
are absolutely stunning it's a shame
that they don't fit me with tights and a
jumper oh yeah and then also picked up
this chain I'm not sure I picked it I
think that was a mod of who's wearing it
and it looked really gorgeous on her
but it's a bit much for me I think the
only way I'd wear this is with like a
black polo neck or something just black
it's a bit brilliant bling but it's
quite nice also this bright orange top
and the top is like a nice silky
material and the bottom is just cotton
and what's really cool about this is at
the back hope you can see it's like an
open back basically
and finally this wrap over I wore this a
lot when I was in Spain and literally
over a bikini
it's gorgeous really elegant it's like a
kimono basically it's got a nice floral
pattern hopefully you can see it it
might be a bit bright so guys I'm
telling you this is like the start of
the haul I've got so much stuff but I'll
leave there like cosmetics to the very
end
okay so I'll show you some shoes that I
recently purchased I got some kids from
shoe this is shoe here and they kind of
specialize in kind of footwear often
men's Footwear and trainers and things
like that but I've noticed that you know
it was wearing converses and vans and
stuff like that and I was gonna go buy a
new pair of converses but they've always
only got fabric right so it's like the
the canvas fabric and I wanted them in
white and I'm like oh you washed them
laughter as they look at a bit of a gray
color whereas I found the kids victory I
picked up the converses and was about to
pay for them and I found the kids in
this in this style and they're leather
so I don't know if you could see but
they are actually 100% leather it's the
exact same style as the vans to be
honest that was it
yeah the vans but they're in the leather
and there were five pounds cheaper and I
was like oh yeah definitely and look how
cute the blue on the insole is
absolutely perfect again for
back-to-school so you guys have to
follow me on instagram it's patio loves
you the reason I said that is because I
basically posted a picture of me and my
new running kit and I am trying to start
running I'm not doing so well right now
but with these trainers and my outfit it
will be fine and dynamic workout light
and Mike's like we need to start running
okay gosh it's like if I have a new kid
I'll go so I bought these new trainers
there's some mics and then absolutely
gorgeous they've got pink on them I feel
like so girly look at my face cringe and
they were I bought them from sports day
late Umbro Lonsdale so yeah they're from
Sports Direct because sports gonna do
really cheap cheap sportswear but that
stuff's quite good like if you're Pro
Runner and stuff you'd go to Sports
Direct and get some stuff and then I've
got this t-shirt and then I also picked
up the black leggings to go with it so I
looked a right piece you know right
'stryed in for about 10 minutes and then
they stopped but yeah that's another
story
so I also went into H&amp;amp;M and actually now
I didn't just go into H&amp;amp;M and basically
oopsy basically this is from H&amp;amp;M and my
boyfriend my husband picked this up for
me from the Barcelona HMMP it's like a
really long touch bag really hard and
this stuff's really on trend right now
and then before I went I picked up I
keep saying I picked up I'm gonna stop
saying that how annoying is that this is
a caller I will speak English right now
apologies rose-gold
and I also bought up the picked up the
bangle as well I'm the rose gold really
etiquette and then I loved this long
this long chain like it's plastic but
it's got a kind of meant to be like a
crystal on the bottom and I would never
pick anything up like this but I really
like this girl called style emphasis is
it emphasis yes cut start style emphasis
on YouTube I love her channel I'll link
her below and she wore like a long
crystal pendant I look so good so that's
the reason I gave one of this and it
looks so lovely on and I also picked up
this jacket which hopefully if it's not
absolutely radiating that you can see
and it's a ruched cropped and blazer
from H&amp;amp;M as well so I've had quite a few
bits of jewelry gifted to me as well
this month and this set of arm candy is
from your fashion jewelry I think it's
calm but I'll put the link in the bottom
bar and you know I'm candy is the big
thing now I think and I love gold and I
wanted something today with my cause
watches stuff and I picked up these here
and basically you get a set of kind of
the gold ones and then with the set or
other ones that go from a collar and
they gradiate into gold so that was the
red one that's the green line I think
the green one's my favorite there's a
pink one as well and there's a blue and
silver one but they all look really nice
kind of layered together on like that
and they look really gorgeous with other
bangles and a watch lovely and from
Belarus as well I was sent this bangle
here which is bangle bracelet here
absolutely elegant me made it's really
heavy like it doesn't feel cheap or
anything really nice only thing is that
it's not really my style it's a bit
feminine but I thought I'd show it to
you guys because I'm sure there might be
someone who likes this Topshop I picked
up this dress you might have seen it in
my lookbook video I will link my
lookbook video actually somewhere here
and it's absolutely stunning it's got
this gap right here I saw the girl in
top
we're winning I was like where is that
dress and it was 38 pounds but it was
really nice and then again going with my
whole long muumuu drapey look I picked
up this long shirt with its a long top
with a pocket here I actually think it's
on the maternity section but it was on
sale for about 18 pounds and he picked
up one thing from Zara which is actually
quite surprising I don't think that she
went into Zara this month meg and my
sister actually got this because she had
this she bought loads of stuff in this
cell and she had the scarf at morning I
love the skirt I want the skirt give me
this girl so she bought me one how
lovely is my system right lovely can you
see it's all pleated and my gorgeous
chiffon fabric absolutely stunning and
then these floral trousers which are
from warehouse there were 25 pounds in
the sale and when I interviewed Whitney
she had a pair of cropped floral
trousers that were kind of gray in cream
and things really reminded me on photos
but I just got some color oh my gosh
that is the clothing darling yes so I'm
gonna show you some of the stuff that I
got duty-free oh no it's not done
actually I've got a few more bits from
Barcelona to show you I've been watching
you I think it's Lily MERS or NLM LRS
basically and she's got YouTube channel
I link it below and she's actually a
blogger and I saw her in one of the
posts wearing one of these chains and
she bought hers from Primark I think
absolutely gorgeous elegant so I had to
pick one up I went to this Spanish store
called Lefty's and it's this can you
seen out there and lefties it's kind of
part of Zara bershka that whole kind of
group so their style the stuff in there
was really nice then picked this up and
also inspiration from her was flat forms
now she had the black pair of platforms
I can't wear flat for this because my
feet are just too long it would just
look like a boat coming at you but these
are similar to the flat forms that she
had or similar like just two flat forms
in general but these are basically
wedges that are suede and black with a
little bit of a peep toe and a wrap
round and it's just a little bit higher
absolutely love these
and also finally I bought these
sunglasses from Barcelona from a vintage
shop they are vintage how cute are they
Michael hates them he said they're like
too big for me but I like them what do
you think they're all right yeah
love those 7 euro which is about 6
pounds and under 6 pounds 5 pounds 60 I
would say that is all the clothing stuff
done let's go onto beauty and makeup
this is more or less stuff I bought
duty-free because it's duty-free 20% off
so I picked up a lipstick from Mac it's
called touch and it's me I just wear
nude so I wanted to add a new new to my
collection and this is the touch and I
think it's just a really nice nude I
think this isn't a good nude on all skin
tones but especially dark skin tones
because we have to kind of try a bit
harder for news and I bought picked up
an eyeshadow as well and this color is
what's it but it's got all right embark
I've been looking for a dark crease
color for a while the darker I have is
not that dark so I guess I picked up and
bark which is very famous and because
I'm not wearing color but I still want
to wear some eye shadow I picked up it's
called mulch or MMU LCH which is a nice
bronzy color I surely recommended this
for me I'm sure we either were trained
them one was like yeah this is the one I
wanted I've got another box of goodies
here I'm keeping stuff in boxes cuz
nature have nowhere to put stuff where I
live right now so before I went away I
picked up body butters from the body
shop they were doing I think it was 2
for the price of one or there were six
pounds or it was a discount I picked up
the raspberry butter body butter and the
papaya body butter I've been using this
I loved it but I still find that it's
not that moisturizing like I need to add
some oils inside that and then I've been
really into skincare crazily recently
and I decided I wanted to start try
stuff from the sanctuary of sanctuary
spoil Covent Garden and they have lots
of facial kits in there professional
facial come
skincare from your wedding well and they
do treatment so I decided to pick up the
treatment in the box and the treatment
in the box basically I'm trying to avoid
the life it basically gives you every
product in this range which is the
Brighton range but in smaller form but
to be honest these will last like three
or four months so and it was only 16
pounds was one of these things is about
16 pounds and it comes with a face mask
and you can buy the face mark separately
for about two pounds maybe three pounds
I bought this one as well and if you buy
oh yeah it's if you buy two sanctuary
products or yeah you buy two you get 1/3
free so I bought this the deep cleansing
facial in a box again it had the set but
I finished everything in it well I've
taken them all out and this was okay the
facial mask is amazing I'll tell you
what that's called the deep cleanse
facial five minutes they're more
dtopping detox mask you can buy the mask
on its own for about two pounds
this mask is amazing it keep like it's
cold you put on your face it heats up
itself not let you put it in the
microwave it heats up itself amazing and
they also bought the face got there
making moisturizing lotion for free is
worth right so while on travels I picked
up Marc Jacobs Lola I really want to be
a perfume girl and just yeah I'm getting
into the whole perfume thing and I had
smoked this one before and I knew I was
gonna buy this duty-free again 20% off
so I picked that one up it's a really
nice it's a sweet so and I like sweet
sauce I like caramel smells but it's got
a bit of floral smell to it as well and
finally I picked up the Bioderma water
solution and to be honest everyone has
been going on about this for ages and
it's got really good recommendations I
believe again through the Persian babe
Barbara that I found out about this
product and I really really wanted it so
I got it I was gonna buy roads but I
think I'm going to Paris sometime this
year so hopefully I can get it again if
I really really like it okay guys I'm
sorry
that was the longest haul ever so sorry
it was so long I hope you don't mind
everyone feel really tired I feel like I
need a cup of tea after that hole okay
guys I will call that a wrap please let
me know if you if you like
like collective halls like this or maybe
smaller halls</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
