good to be back at home and back in
London for those of you who don't know
if you watched my last video I know that
I've been in America so I've basically
been in LA but I also went to Florida I
stayed with the gorgeous Rey and her
husband Eric they were the most amazing
host ever I'm so grateful for them too
for having us there in their home so
thank you guys send her some love I'll
link her channel below and my sister had
a baby as well my older half-sister you
guys have not met her before because she
doesn't actually live in this country
but and she had a gorgeous baby boy to
add to her trio of boys already so it's
got four little boys and I had such an
amazing time just hanging around with
them and stuff so today I wanted to do
share with you my body routine and
regime and all that kind of stuff
because I've never done this video
before and I don't know why because body
routine is necessary it's not everyday
makeup what about your body and I have
so many little things that are a little
bit annoying that I know that I have to
stay on top of so number one let's start
with hair removal so in the past I've
done everything I've uploaded I have
shaved I have a wax and now I'm company
doing laser now if I wasn't doing laser
my preference is actually shaving and
which I know lots of people like who
shaves like I would definitely shave and
I love the Gillette the Venus razor
amazing it's got really nice and kind of
like creamy bars which really do glide
along your legs and all that kind of
stuff and I still shave my legs but the
funny thing about me is that my hair
doesn't actually grow very long and my
hair is very very fine so I only ever
needed to shave honestly once my legs
and only probably once every four months
because my hair's really really don't
grow and I don't know why but I do have
the little hair follicles I have lots of
dots and stuff like that which is super
super naughty but when it comes to the
other regions such as the armpits and
the vajayjay we're just gonna refer to
it vajayjay today we're all adults okay
here when I was in Thailand last I got a
bit carried away that the Thai ladies
can do
an awesome math edge they know how to
wax an eyebrow make em feet look good
I'm going to just get my you know
vajayjay Eisley you know let's sweep
that hair away and let's just be fresh
and extra glamorous for the beach time
and I was like yes I'm going to just get
a nice wet so they have beauty parlours
and Ferrari we're so I went in I was
like oh can you just wax like works it
all off please thank you very much and
what kind of stuff anyway so and one
there were two women like and the woman
literally like I was laid flat on the
bed she hiked my legs up literally like
it was no tomorrow spread it like a
spread Igor like you'd like spread out
and I never had a vajayjay wax before so
I don't know I went to Thailand to do my
friends in the JD wax okay that's just
weird and but yeah when and you know
spread it all out everything was just
like separate right whoa awful show
there wasn't even like any like way to
like cover up what anything is that note
well in that anyway she went in like a
surgeon she's like really focus like
getting in and they used the hot wax and
the cotton and the cotton strands and
she basically is waxing I'm telling you
that it was extremely painful like i
what i watering lee painful anyone
telling me that a fanny wax isn't her is
lying in it's not true it hurt a tear
was that's like gonna drip him but you
know you can't you know be acting like
that around the tile a DS because
they'll be like what's wrong with you
like matt not like ty women did not
playing no games or spread your legs and
take it anyway so I was literally it was
painful but the good thing it's quite
quick and actually down below it hurt
less then Mike up top it was a squirts
anyway I did it and she literally
climbed on top of the bed to really get
in there she really wanted to get in
there and I was like why this woman
straddling me I like damn she takes her
job seriously seriously so I have one
Thai woman like straddling me and I have
another one holding the cotton and the
hot wax and
the day my results were literally
amazing I'm telling you it was smooth it
was like you know if you could you'd
walk down the street showing it off but
clearly no one does that but I would
have liked if that was the alternate
universe where everyone walked out with
their fatties out whatever but it was
like lovely or smooth it was silky it
just shot as gorgeous right but let me
tell you when it was time for that hair
to grow out huh I'm telling you I've
never had anything like that
it was literally ingrown hairs central
it was so bad I'm telling you it was not
pretty and I know this is a bit too much
information but it was not pretty coming
back and I was literally in shock
I would never wax my vajayjay ever again
like literally others like never ever
again so the hair removal or it's
shaving not a cat inhales chance it was
just it was crazy it was so
uncomfortable as it grew out and
everything and I just said oh my god and
I'm telling you I think it took about 3
to 4 months to really grow back out and
I had to grow all the way back out I
couldn't do anything to it again because
it was really bad but which is kind of
grotesque right anyway so then I went
back to shaving and I thought I don't
want to do this so now I'm currently
having laser and all over but for me I
definitely would recommend shaving I'm
good for shaving I don't really like
epilation because my hairs are very fine
so it's hard for the epilator to pick up
my hair I found and also I like hair
remover but it's not very good for your
skin and it stink and I'm having laser
hair removal at the Skin Clinic and
they're amazing you guys know I've
talked about the skin clinic from like
four years ago I've always used their
product and they're basically like a
dermatology center they do like lasers
and peels and all that kind of stuff so
I'm having my laser there they should be
worried that if you're black or your
dark skin that you can't do laser but
you can you just need the right lasers
you
on your skin so I'm having laser and I'm
also having Fraxel as well to help me
with my pores on my face and they might
have a skin pill but basically that is
my hair removal routine as it currently
stands so yeah so the next step of the
hair removal is obviously it's
exfoliation which is totally totally
essential I do have keratosis pilaris
which is basically chicken skin but you
have like the little dots I have them at
my elbows really annoying and I kind of
have them on my legs just at the side
lots of people have these little bombs
like the little bumps that kind of like
they call it chicken skin or whatever
and the best way to treat this is to
exfoliate now I can exfoliate physically
so that's why using a body brush the
body shop has amazing amazing body
brushes and you can dry brush your skin
really get those dead skin cells off and
before a buff I wouldn't do it every day
but maybe like once a week ideally like
two or three times a week to really help
it's a really good treatment and it's
very relaxing in a circular motion
towards your heart wonderful wonderful
wonderful and then I also like chemical
exfoliant so I've been talking about
their like Paula's choice but anything
that has got glycolic acid in it or
salicylic acid in it it's great to help
with the breakdown of dead skin cells
and basically that's what causes the
build-up so when it comes to having
ingrown heads or razor bumps my best
method of treatment is basically using a
tweezer to really just gently get these
out one by one and be very very careful
but also when you exfoliate it really
helps to avoid any kind of razor bumps
forming that really does help your skin
to keep renewing itself which means that
you won't have skin forming over where
your hair follicle is meant to come out
alternatively I love this product and
cool ten skin it's great for ingrown
hairs and razor bumps and I just put it
on like a little cotton bug and apply
that to anywhere where I have ingrown
hairs we all have them now I used to
call it strawberry legs but the reality
is like the little follicles if they're
not bumps it they just don't disappear
lots of people thought I've got really
like smooth skin and stuff
and after seeing my pictures now it's
just the Sun right the sunlight blast it
out and I've got a little bit more used
to having strawberry now you can get a
spray tanned which are really good if
you are black you can definitely get a
spray tan if anything spray tans make
you look just extra rich and extra
chocolaty and more even in the skintone
when my friends get a spray tan very
regularly and she looks literally Gor
just like literally flawless then Sally
Hampson has an air airbrush spray so if
you want to just you know for a night
out you want to get smoother legs the
airbrush spray is a really good option
to make your legs look super smooth and
even but things like strong legs is just
literally what happens to some of us
another thing I like to do is actually
facial exercises now that I'm getting a
little bit older and stuff like that I
found that facial exercises are a really
good way to keep your face firm and
stuff like that you might see that you
might be getting a bit of a jowl a bit
of a double neck but if you realize in
your face your face has muscles if you
work your facial muscles then your face
is going to be tighter more firm and
avoid wrinkles and anything that
involves like resistance so pushing back
when you do one move and I'll probably
just show you some couple of facial
exercises but it really does make your
face for a bit more tighter refreshed
and renewed and there's lots of people
who do facial exercises that actually
say that it makes them look younger and
all that kind of stuff so I love it so
guys that is my body routine I really
hope that you enjoyed that I will link
