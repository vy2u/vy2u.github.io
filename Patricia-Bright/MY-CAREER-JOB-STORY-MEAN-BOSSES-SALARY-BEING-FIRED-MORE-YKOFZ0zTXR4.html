cried all the time and starting salary
at that time was about 35 to 40 thousand
pounds but into the internship and this
is me younger in the city
oh hi guys welcome to my channel I hope
you are doing well today
I wanted to give you guys a little bit
insight into my career and kind of
Education history and I felt like I've
done I've mentioned what I've done
before but I've never really done a
video on it so today I'm gonna give you
guys a little bit of insight into that
part of me
and I do feel like you know someone's
career and their their experiences gives
you a little bit of insight into who
they might be
as a person so I'm going to a couple of
stories as I go and for those of you who
I don't know where you've been you've
probably seen a lot of the stuff that
has been happening in stateside and
there is so much injustice that is going
on and I am here to stand up and say you
know I am totally here with the movement
of black lives matter and yes all lives
do matter but right now there's one big
issue and it is the despairing treatment
of particular groups of people that are
black so right about now that's what
we're going to scream and shout about
but I kind of wanted to do this video as
a video to give people just a bit of
inspiration and to feel slightly
empowered and just to stand in
solidarity with my brothers and sisters
in the USA as well and I'm going to lead
just some info in the description box as
well so my first real real job was
actually selling better wear catalogs
and that was basically this catalog that
used to put through doors and of like
neighbors and like streets around your
area which I did and has about 13 14 and
one of the neighbors basically was doing
child labor and riku to the children in
the area to go and distribute catalogs
taking the orders and then distribute
the good goods after so I wouldn't
really call that a career but that was
the first thing I did and that was the
only thing I had on my CV before I was
16 - when I got my first job so my first
job like in the shop was in retail
and I worked at in House of Fraser
specifically in the brand called coast
which was basically bridesmaids dresses
slash just I don't know proms Latin you
know just random
I call it grandma we're now so I started
going with like a long satin skirt and
like just a button-down cardigan and
that kind of thing and I always felt
very grandma looking but is you know
high quality and quite expensive but
when I moved to university and moved
into Selfridges in Manchester and I
worked there but under the same brand
and and I worked there basically to root
through uni now in my last two years of
uni I was just sick and tired of working
I just didn't like working and I just
like I've got to quit so I quit my job
and I was doing hair so you guys do know
that I've always been someone who's been
doing hair extensions or hairstyling for
people and I absolutely loved it and I
had my own clients who would come to my
house and I had a client he'll come from
Birmingham for me to do her hair so I
was you know one of those livingroom
hairstylist so that's where my kind of
love for her kind of started and always
was so those aren't really careers but
there are some of the ways that I made a
living so I know that so many of you
guys are University students who watch
me and you realize you've got to do what
you've got to do so if you couldn't get
the retail job then you might need to do
a little something something for
yourself now when I got my first out of
school career jobs I firstly did an
internship so I can now I'm happy to say
I worked at Merrill Lynch and I used to
always not like to say cuz actually when
I first started youtube I was interning
at Mills um at the time and I was very
embarrassed one to be doing YouTube and
obviously didn't want to jeopardize my
career chances by anybody finding out
finding out at Mills that I did this and
so I worked at Merrill's within
Investment Banking specifically I worked
within technology and I did not do a
technology group degree I did an
accounting degree so one of my friends
he was super smart and he would you
already had his summer internship and he
told me to go to
a networking dinner and for women at
Merrill Lynch and they invited students
and I heater basically had his job and
he was really smart and he taught me
Patricia go there and go there really
keen so me and him had like a sit-down
talking session we were talking about
the market so he's talking about
technology we were talking about all
this stuff and then when I came to the
Women in Technology networking dinner I
came there prepared so there were all
these up for other female students there
and I came I can ask a question about
the financial markets what do you see I
don't was that girl I came in like ready
to just let everybody know that I had
arrived and I know that that made me
stand out because after that and I then
remember the recruiter are reaching out
to me and talking to me a little bit
more than I felt like she maybe talk to
some of the other people because at that
did I really made an effort to to kind
of stand out and I had a notepad and pen
and most of the other girls kind of were
like looking at me like what does this
go no that we don't know but obviously I
had had a bit of schooling so my bit
over the Vice that any of you guys who
might be going to summer internships or
you want to get an internship there may
be networking dinners or events that are
happening go to them and go to them King
you'd understand that for the internship
that I was on 7,000 students applied or
I think it was like massive amounts of
students applied and there were there
were a hundred interns so the reality of
this situation was really real it was
extremely competitive and I knew that it
was competitive and you do entrance
exams and entrance tests before you get
onto the internship and I did my test
and I can doing that time and I did the
it was the numerical exam and I thought
when I tell you I flopped I left that
room crying because I knew that I had
felt I knew that I miss certain things I
knew that I forgot to study for certain
stuff that came up during the entrance
exam so my next piece of advice is if
there's a test practice and prepare
for every last bit of it so yeah I
failed it and that you know they came
back to me the recruiter came back to me
and said to me Patricia and you you
found the test and I was just like no
because I had all my hopes like you know
on this internship and I'll be able to
be this was the only internship I had
applied for the other guys that kind of
girl but she basically said to me
Patricia I want you to come back in I
want to do the test again and at that
point in time I realized it was because
I had created that Network and that bond
with the recruitment team as well as
some of the other women in the business
who had remembered me and really wanted
me to come on board that I was given the
opportunity to take the test again and
obviously I did the test again and I
passed and then I got on to the
internships and I got into the
internship and this is me younger team
UCD
uh and starting salary at that time was
about thirty five to forty thousand
pounds so and that's probably about
seventy thousand now at the time it was
about seventy thousand US dollars so for
a 21 year old that was like hmm with
living and you got a five K sign-on
bonus Boop hey you're watching can you
imagine so obviously I was you know
getting a lot of money for someone who
was so young and you know working in the
city living that life and basically the
concept was that kind of industry is
what card play card and on my internship
the team I ended up being in I was one
of there was no other interns in my
group or in my team I were very seeing
women and um within my team I really
felt like I didn't fit in but it you
know when you just fought awkward I was
so so so awkward so quiet so shy so
reserved and I remember that the
feedback I kept getting was that you I
needed to come out of my shell more
Patricia that you guys see now needed to
come out of her shell that I wasn't
gelling with the team and that they
didn't feel like they know me so when it
came to might the internship group the
internship in
Hey most people knew who I was because I
was loud and fun and taking to the
raving I'm number one on the dance floor
busting them Vicki I was there for it
but when it came to like being in that
professional environment because I was
so much sure of myself I didn't know
what I was doing what I was good this
was like oh I kind of panicked and but I
always worked hard and so I got lots of
you know rate high rating and grading in
regards to the work and the quality of
the work that I do but the downgrading
that I had was that I was not I wasn't
connecting with the team anyway you know
I tried to improve that so I could go
out on the work drinks even though I
felt so awkward cuz I was so young and
it was just kind of like just these like
40 50 year old guys and you know
everyone's got wife and kids and you
know they go to you know I don't know
some random places on holiday and I'm
just thinking what we're going to do in
Oxford Circus that weekend and but
eventually you're not in made in
connecting with the team really well and
then I ended up getting the full-time
role we then did an induction in New
York so that's the first time I went to
New York and had an amazing time that
was the time with my wig fell off that
was the time when everyone found out
about my youtube channel and was cause
my youtube channel because I was a joke
of my internship class because of it but
I made it through and I started working
and I kind of worked with the same team
but you know people had moved around
there were other people there and the
same issue happened was the case of I
just wasn't confident so you guys see me
now as confident but when I was working
I just felt so strong I like I just felt
like this is a big world of all these
older people you know as you know the
youngest girl on the team and then
someone who's been there for 15 years
and someone who's been there for eight
years and someone else and then there's
me who doesn't have a clue but I had the
most amazing a mentor and she was just
like Patricia let me tell you this is
how you've got to do it this is how
you've got to be push push push if you
don't know how to do something teach
yourself to do it ask questions pull
someone over and ask them
how do I do this thing and she was the
one who really pushed me just cuz I used
to say well I don't know how to do it
and I'd sit there and I'd be so scared
to ask someone's I didn't want to
disturb them and they're busy doing
their work but she was just like just
ask just ask just ask and I started
doing it and I really thought Mike I'd
learn more I had a horrible um senior
manager than if he would say he won't
see this he was horrible
and did I ever cry on my job I cried I
cried all the time
I'd come home crying because if he was
very condescending and made you feel
very stupid and one time like you in the
middle of the meeting and I just kind of
went well just see that one that wanted
this was dyeing your face I had that
moment where I was just like you know
you know you can't say yes anyway like I
just don't know what I'm doing and
you're just rude and you're just
really impacting me in a negative way
and I and I just felt awful and I
remember after that he kind of was a bit
softer on me and but there was always an
awkwardness after I think was two and a
half years I was then made redundant
they were doing other cuts in the bank
and I was one who got cut but now
looking back I can totally see why I was
made redundant because at the end of the
day if you don't really connect to the
team you're not they're not going to
keep you on when when times are hard
they're going to let guide the person
who they don't feel the closest to and
that's what happened to me and then I
got recruited by Deloitte Consulting to
work there and I'm going to tell you
that Deloitte was the hardest job of my
life I think that job was hard I'm going
to go into it
but I'll tell you that I learn the most
from my experience like it wasn't even
long as there for a year and a half
because it was hard and but what I
learned there is what I apply to this
very day
so with consulting you have to come in
and kind of know what you're talking
about because what you do you advise
clients so you can't go to the client
like I go no no there's none of that you
come to the client but you know
everything
and the reason was hard because the
hours were hard you had to work very
hard very intense you might work on a
bid you might be there to like two
o'clock in the morning
everybody hates being on a bid which is
basically a proposal you might be there
from - you'll be up there to 7:00 you'll
make your dotting every T and your
crossing every I and you're delivering
to the client and what they end up doing
is that the director kind of ends up
submitting your work and analyzing your
work but you and someone else do I
remember me a continent that I was like
Ling me and Ling it was just me and Ning
just eating our lunch on this proposal
hopeful for like days till two o'clock
in the morning we were just delirious at
that point in time but the issues you
don't complain you come in you work you
come in at 7:00 you do that quick bid
you do that proposal because that cut
that director is going to ask for it on
the table and he's going to rip it to
shreds it was not how they were they
pick everything apart and then I learn
to like really be really critical about
work but in a good way
and then what else happened and then
another thing is then where you go on to
client site and I ended up you know work
it going to quite senior people and I
remember somehow ended up being at a
meeting with the head of Camden Council
by myself and they basically threw me in
and I was advising him on how to improve
his business analysis capability
meantime I've been working there for
three months I don't even know how to
spell business an accent capability
enjoyed his object here I did that but I
was this guy me by myself and then his
team and I was like so in my opinion I
think that came from my document
selecting not having a clue so yeah with
consulting you basically got thrown in
at the deep end and what you didn't know
you learnt and I ended up working on two
to three really good projects of really
good clients like that were like global
impacting but I remember it just being
very very
tense I would eat my dinner at what once
it hit nine o'clock and he was still in
the office it meant that you could have
dinner and have dinner ordered and I'll
be there and I'd be eating my dinner and
I'd be just going to the toilet and this
was just after I got married calling my
husband and be like I'm here again I've
got to stay late again and just got be
quite upset that I wasn't able to live
my life and then you know sometimes even
on the weekends it's like I've just got
to go do some extra work and it was very
hard I do think that consultants are
quite a hard job eventually I was just
like for me that this was not for me
however I will say again the experience
that I gained at Deloitte was experience
that I applied to now definitely the the
the just the intensity as is why I work
so in tempting now because you have a
sink or swim eventually when you have
enough years of experience
you basically have people calling your
phone a headhunting you to work at
different banks and different firms and
so I ended up getting this call from
bank of Tokyo which probably again was
one of my best like the best places to
like the tit and by this point in time I
was very confident in myself I was very
confident in my experience I was very
confident in my knowledge so the
difference between one year and four
years work experience is massive and
then I got that job offer I went in and
I met the manager and he was and he was
like he was senior executive director
something like that and I was just like
I want to work for this guy cuz he was
amazing and I never knew that managers
could be like this he was very calm he
knew his work so much he was very
responsive to people as individuals and
his energy was so soft that I couldn't
say no to the job I had already said I'm
not going to work anymore
and that offer came and I wasn't so sure
about it and I met him I was like you
know I want to work for you I know work
for your team because you're amazing
this is how people make a big difference
where you work and it was a Japanese
bank so Japanese back to have an amazing
culture they're very respectful and that
there isn't this sense of rush rush rush
right
right now whatever so I came with my
consulting intensity and everyone was
very much very respectful very calm very
level-headed and and again I learnt it
much of being that environment and
because I'd found my voice I was able to
bring so much to the table at that job
and I always felt like my opinion was so
valued there and it again is one of
those things that was um made such a big
difference bank of Tokyo was my last
official in the city career girl job and
was my favorite because I met some the
best people I still speak to them now
and I learn a lot but I gave so much and
I mean I say this to encourage that
number one though the first job I ever
got I didn't exactly have the
qualifications I didn't have enough you
cast points to even do the application
but I did the application anyway and I
fell the exam but because I had
connected with the people and people is
really what matters at the end of the
day I got the role right and and I
firstly wasn't very confident I wasn't
very good at my job
when I first started out and and that's
okay
duality is that everyone starts from
somewhere and confidence comes with time
so the more I work the more confidence I
had and by the third job I had I was
like he comes Patricia like they're
probably roll their eyes here comes miss
opinionated again and and yeah I just
say this to just kind of give you guys a
bit of insight into my career and that
everything I have today is based on a
lot of hard work sleepless nights late
nights applying and teaching myself a
lot of things I do think that those are
some of the keys to being successful in
any career or business that you ever
want to do so guys that is my career
story and I do feel like it was a little
bit indulgent for me I don't know maybe
you know my youtube channel
some days I've got to reminisce people
have been saying that you know they
don't feel
they're seeing me well here's a bit of
me it's a bit my story you know it is
nice to have a little chat but also
provides an insight into myself hey guys
and welcome to my channel so today I'm
going to do a cheat oil
