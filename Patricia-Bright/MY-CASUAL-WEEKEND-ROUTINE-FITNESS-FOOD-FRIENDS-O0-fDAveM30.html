little bit of an ultimate weekend
routine with me just to give you guys an
idea why I actually get up to on a
Saturday morning so first things first I
wake up by an alarm I've moved my phones
on the side of my bed because I like the
thought of not reading a lot on the
weekend this alarms a little bit
annoying but you know what
it gets me up right next I go to my room
where I basically keep all my clothing
and shoes and all that kind of stuff you
guys have seen this closet room anyway
and the first thing I want to try and do
is work out I'm not that disciplined yet
but I really need to work on the tush
right neither lifting and shaping and as
you can see my feeble looking arms I do
it at home workout it's by Six Pack
Shortcuts which I basically saw on an ad
on YouTube and actually bought it but
it's actually really good so I do it at
home for about 20 minutes on the weekend
now obviously are for that exercise I
probably work myself up an appetite on
the weekend I try to like have something
that I really like but if I know that
I'm having lunch
I have something like so either eggs or
a nutribullet
I am literally obsessed I got my three
weeks ago I don't know why I didn't know
about this before and I keep making the
exact my husband thinks I'm crazy
because of how many actually general he
makes as many as I do my favorite mix is
apple pear spinach and mango and yeah
they're so quick and easy to do I'm late
to the party but I would definitely get
one if you don't have one I wish I could
the tune is fantastic boys so I could
slap a stupid out of everyone so next I
might go to the living room which never
gets any love because I'm never in here
but on the weekend I can basically put
on like Come Dine With Me or something
stupid and just watch it for like half
an hour or something as you can clearly
see and next I get to do like a proper
beauty routine on the weekend and I love
wearing this headband this is from the
body shop and I you do a skincare Mars
this is a vitamin E Mars from the body
shot and it's a great moisturizing
treatment it's so quick and easy but in
the winter I find that my skin is a lot
drier I leave that on for about five
minutes and I'm going to hop into the
shower I'm using a deep sleep shower gel
but I use it because it's really
relaxing and the weekend and be relaxed
they also like using a body brush on the
weekend to really exfoliate my skin nice
and deeply clearly you can see I'm very
happy at the thought of this on my face
you guys know about my glycolic acid gel
I use it every single day even in the
morning sometimes and it gives me smooth
skin and I'm using this drops of youth
it's an eye gel from the body shop and I
found that it's just made my eyes look
less puffy and I don't know what it is
about that rollerball it just makes them
feel so smooth and I'm using Clinique
super defense in the day because it is
SPF 25 and it's very moisturizing shea
butter I love this I have the ashes skin
ever my hands are always crusty
sometimes the knees yes just give them a
hardcore moisturization that is what I
like to do for my makeup I'm wearing my
makeup forever HD foundation and I'm
just doing the lazy application people
were lazy eye brows I just been in with
my L'Oreal pencil here
and this concealer has come out my
closet again yes it's the one it's one
Bobby Brown no creasing and it's like
it's not too bright that's what I really
like about it
and I'm just using this palette which is
from Sigma it's a new one I'll link it
in the description bar below just for a
really gentle like you know Brown
neutral eye some liquid eyeliner and
some mascara on my lips I'm just using
these drugstore Revlon lipsticks and lip
balms they're amazing I'm kind of liking
pink lips on me at the moment it's kind
of innocent and yeah I wish I wish I
wish actively objectify concern the
circularity
I've been using a few more drugstore
products for you guys and I've gone back
to my sneak of brushes gorgeous I love
the color as you can see my finished
look is right secret innocent and it's
so quick and easy
in regards to what I'm wearing basically
black jumper leather jacket really
really simple for me I like to keep it
super simple and I've got a little scarf
and putting on as well
what I'm done my room is probably a
massive mess and I might have a friend
around or some things I will clean that
up a little bit later but we're about to
go and get some brunch and there's this
place I love to go to life according oh
gosh so obviously in autumn it's a bit
colder I always opted for like skinny
jeans and boots and I go to this place
called brew I've been posting it on my
Instagram like all the time for like
blueberry pancakes YUM lattes oh my gosh
it's ridiculous I have eggs were element
in the time not going to get some banana
there's blueberries inside the pie
makers well

my autumn weekend done and dusted I hope
you enjoyed it and I'll do more videos

me know if that helped you guys and help
