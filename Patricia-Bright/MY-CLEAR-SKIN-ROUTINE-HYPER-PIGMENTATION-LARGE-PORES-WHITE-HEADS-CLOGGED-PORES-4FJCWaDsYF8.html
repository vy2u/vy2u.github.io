hey guys so today I'm about to do the
most expensive skincare routine video
and for those of you who don't know I'm
a bit of a skincare junkie and a product
junkie I put my hands up I'll buy a lot
of product I love them and I have a
quite an extensive day and night routine
and I'm telling you I probably use about
ten products but look look okay right
don't tell me off I know there's gonna
be someone who's gonna be you don't need
to use all those products I know but I
like them but for the rest y'all who you
know like me you know you're like you
like this kind of stuff and might be
dealing with some of the skincare
problems that I have get a notepad a pen
and paper a cup of tea if you need to
pause this video you can do that and I'm
going to show you what I do so first
thing let me address the kind of
skincare issues that I've had and number
one I would say that I deal with
hyperpigmentation and usually happens
when you are black or brown and I know
lots of women do so not just that but I
do have areas of my skin that are dark
heart or if I have a spot they might get
a dark patch and when it scars and also
large pores you guys know these have
been the bane of my life and just
general like rough texture so large
pores hyper pigmentation rough skin and
I'm quite an oily person but I don't
think there's much I can do about that
one I think oil is good for the skin
because it means that you're not going
to age as badly as an ashy person so
yeah so I'm going to start off with my
morning routine and what my favorite
products are the number one I give
myself a cleanse in the morning and I
like to use something gentle so I'm
currently using the Sunday Riley so I
mix lip and I love anything that is like
a clay cleanser because it really does
extract like grime and stuff out of the
pores this is really really gentle in my
opinion I also love the bodyshop clay
cleanser you guys know that I've used it
for years I'll link it down below but
this is just a really nice gentle
cleanser that I use in the morning after
that I would use a toner or some form of
treatment I am using the Paula's Choice
then refining treatment and this is a BH
a now VHA is basically are things like
salicylic acid and I am all about using
as
ADEs and you know in moderation and at
the right percentage regularly now
especially when you're dealing with
large pores or pores that get clogged
exfoliation is really important and if
you have acne actually as well and I
find that when I use products like this
this is I can leave on product I use ad
with my fingers or cotton pad and it
contains salicylic acid and salicylic
acid is able to go into the pore extract
from the pore and change the shape of
the pore and I definitely use an eye
cream on a roll-on I use the body shops
drops of youth I've been a big fan of
this for a long time where like it is
because it's really really like some eye
creams can look very heavy and the end
up was shiny eye lids this is so light
but very very moisturizing and I
actually have eczema on my eyes like it
comes and goes it's so annoying I had it
on this eye for like three months
disappeared now I have it on this side
underneath for like two months is so
annoying but this is a perfect eye cream
for or eye concentrate for the day
finally for the morning I would top it
off with some form of sunscreen now if
you're using things that are exfoliating
or contain vitamin C no matter how
chocolaty Chocula you are or how white
you are sunscreen is an essential
because realistically sun damage is
really real and it does cause
hyperpigmentation to be worse and I
found that as a woman of color the
sunscreens always look pasty why do I
look blue like why am i glow in the dark
no but I find that there are much more
Scherrer sunscreens that are coming up
this is another polished choice product
this is the broad spectrum SPF 50 youth
extending daily mattifying so light so
like water and this is a sunscreen and
moisturizer it is amazing there's also
the dr. Lancer you guys know I love dr.
Lancer I have the sheer fluid sunscreen
in SPF 30 as well so now we're moving on
to the night
I'm section where it gets really really
real I've usually been wearing makeup
all day so I will remove my makeup I
will either use the simple my Salah
cleanse and wipes and I never really
used to like cleansing wipes for a long
time but I love this product I mentioned
it in my last video my favorite video so
this is a really really good product for
the evening to take off your makeup or I
will use a cleansing butter I love a
cleansing butter and this is the
chamomile cleansing butter from the body
shop beautiful I love it
you just rub it on and then you like
wash it off and all that good stuff so
yeah after that I give myself a nice
cleansing wash and I'm currently using
the Mario Badescu actually facial
cleanser it contains salicylic acid it
is great for acne and great for closing
up the pores and it doesn't have to be
this one I usually use the Skin Clinic
one as well a really good acne based
cleanser is great for those of you with
oily skin acne prone skin or large pores
this is the product that I'm using to
cleanse in the evening after that my
face is usually squeaky clean and then I
go ahead with the good stuff it's the
Paula's Choice skin perfecting aah a gel
at 8% this is a glycolic acid based
product I love this product I have had
this product for going on the same
bottle by the way for about two and a
half years right about now people and I
think I use I use this in every skincare
video I'm sorry this product is a
miracle product as in the next morning
your face is shining like it looks like
you are a new person the next morning
genuinely and it is quite a potent
product I believe that they're going to
stop selling it in the UK Wow Wow
so my American fans I might need you to
stock up and vend me this product
because it's so good and I love this
product it just transforms my faith by
the morning off that I look gorgeous and
glowing and radiant and I love a good
exfoliator like this and I know lots of
people go and get like um
like pills and my sister had pills they
use glycolic acid they use the same
thing but at a much higher percentage
and so this is a little dose of those
pills every other day but be careful
because if you have sensitive skin you
could experience redness or some dryness
but your body will adjust so just use it
every four days and then use it every
other day until you get used to it after
that I use a night cream around my eyes
I'm using the advanced night repair eye
cream I'm using this eye cream I'm
loving it is very very nice
and then I've always loved vitamin C
from the body shop they don't mess about
with their vitamin C I used to use um I
don't know if they sell this product
anymore but you should be able to get
like pure vitamin C like serum and it
lasted for ten days and it just makes
you beautiful and if you have
hyperpigmentation or you want to
brighten your skin vitamin C is a
natural way to do this and that's why
people rub lemons and all that kind of
good stuff on their face and this is the
vitamin C glow boosting moisturizer so
after I'll do my gel treatment are
adding moisture Iser on top of it and
this is a really good one from the body
shop I think this is actually quite new
and but it's really really good and I'd
be buying Viet Minh tea look I'm gonna
link my old videos okay I'm gonna look
my videos from three years ago where I
talked about the exact same product
almost but that you know there's some
refreshing going on here you know and
then finally I mentioned that in my
favorites that I'm loving the lunar
sleeping night oil from Sunday Riley and
it is retinoid oil so retina a is great
for acne grateful really renewing
refreshing the skin and retinoids are
basically a derivative of that in a way
that is less harsh on skin like people
have great results for my vitamin A is
retina retina and all that good stuff
but they have redness they have peeling
like it's not for everybody skin no
everybody can handle it so this is a
great alternative if you want to try
something that's a little bit you know
deeper that's going to really cause some
transformation so I use this at night
now that is that's one two three four
five six seven eight nine ten like about
eleven products but you can see the way
that they all work together so you
my NHS might be a chaise my sunscreens
my cleanses my retinoids and my
treatment in a way that is like
balancing to my skin and for those of
you who might suffer from you know
skincare problems you don't need all of
what I say I would say that you need to
at least start with three things which
is a really good acne cleanser which
contains salicylic acid I would say you
should definitely incorporate glycolic
acid into your skin care and definitely
go with a really strong and sunscreen
and moisturizer factor 30 and above as
well as four I had to add one more thing
anything vitamin C and moisturizing and
that's my like definite things I think
you definitely need to have and to
really have some good skin in the long
term that smooth and shiny and ugly and
gorgeous so guys I hope that video
