well today I'm going to finally finally
can you guess what I'm finally going to
do yeah I guess I'm finally going to do
a room tour and I'm really excited about
well I'm not really excited I feel
really kind of nervous about doing the
room tour just because I don't have like
I don't mind I don't have a lot of stuff
then you know a lot of people have a lot
of stuff in some of these room tours and
I'm really not that go with a lot of
stuff but then I think oh it's a bit
better anyway well it's a bit different
because probably more normal normal
girls probably don't have a lot of stuff
as well so it kind of just shows how I
organize my stuff and as well and some
of you guys know that me and my husband
we bought our first house together
in October last year and I hope one day
to do a proper house tour and just show
you where my room is where our house has
come from we've done a lot of work we
basically bought the house in London and
then we it was it was nice but it wasn't
us
so we basically spent loads and loads of
money on basically getting it all done
fresh modern and just as we want here
because we like um period period
properties I have like a Victorian house
and we've not finished the kitchen as
yet like pray for the kitchen because
that means but look on the kitchen yet
but so far I'm going to show you my room
today and you guys should definitely
check out my blog moments of Starcom
because I'll have BEC more detailed
pictures coming up on the blog in a few
in a few days and on my room anyway I'm
gonna go ahead
and show you it and be nice like it's
still so person will show you this stuff
might just show up you guys are lovely
and I feel like you're my friends so
I'll show you that so this is my room
when you walk in so this is my kind of
like dressing table kind of storage II
make up he area but there's lots of
different things to it also sometimes do
work here is well my laptop actually
regularly and I'll just going close to
some of the bits I've got so first we've
got this cake stand which is what I
actually use to store bracelets and a
few necklaces and rings and earrings and
it's made of glass and it's just really
gorgeous this really gorgeous um blue
glass with a nice detail I love that and
then these are faux flowers here the
reason I've got five flowers is because
I can't really keep real flowers alive
for very long so I just think it adds
some nice color and dimension to the
room and this mirror here is a trifold
mirror which I got from next and it was
99 pounds but I think it's worthwhile
it's really sturdy really heavy and it's
just a really nice mirror where you get
to see a lot of a lot of me lots of me
and these lights are from Ikea they're
just for my kid
and I think they just look nice dotted
around the mirror and he is my Mac and I
use it all the time I also have a
MacBook Pro I've also got an iMac but
that's in another room so this is my
blog book this is often where I write
ideas for like blog posts and video
ideas and then this is a comic book that
I'm reading now which is called ten
thoughts about time and me and Mike have
been trying to read this for about 10
years
well know for you here but I'm just
finally getting around to it so I keep
that there cuz I know that I want to use
it and then here is my makeup storage if
I'd be totally honest with you this is
the majority of my makeup I'd really
don't have a lot of makeup
don't really store a lot of stuff and I
like to get rid of things so I actually
this isn't a Muji case this was a case
that was sent to me I'm gonna have more
details in a whole video but it's
absolutely amazing it's so sturdy it's
not like really flimsy and these drawers
here are really really deep and it's
just great storage for everything I'm
going to go through it so in this top
drawer here I basically keep my MAC
lipsticks lip gloss is and just a few
other lip glosses I really probably only
have another two Mac lip glosses i do
not have lipstick sorry i do not have a
lot and when i'm finished with something
i throw it away and i usually buy
another one so on top i have this plant
pot which is actually from i care and
then i keep out a powder and a
foundation that i wear daily so it's
really easy for me to just pop these on
and when I'm getting ready and I have
this neutral eyes palette which is from
Benefit Cosmetics and I love this
palette I can open it up and I just love
this palette because it just has got
really basic easy colors that you can
wear everyday
so in here I've got my powders my
concealers and my gel liner in here I
basically have all my well a number of
blushes my contour kit and a number of
eyes shadow palettes I do have other
eyeshadow palettes that I never use so
they're stored in this cupboard here
which I'll come to there's not much in
there in here I keep my foundations and
foundation samples that I'm going to try
out and then here I keep my mascara line
are additional lipsticks just random
things here again I'm not the kind of
person who has a lot of stuff and for me
this is all the makeup I need and in
here in here I keep my polishes which is
actually a growing collection and I
don't mind growing a collection of
polishes because you can always try
loads of different kind of polishes so
that's that here and it's mainly berry
it's mainly barium on this side and then
these are random others and I've got
Apio back there because it can't stand
up straight I love this storage item
because it really does keep a lot of
items and it's just easy to use and over
here I just keep a couple of magazines
so got Elle and glamour and you guys
might see Romeo and Juliet this is up to
you my favorite movie and I just watch
it for fun so this desk is actually from
I can't really easy and there's a drawer
in here so this is how you know I'm
really not fabulous I basically keep
stationary in here so pens I've got my
business cards here couple of wires a
couple of other business cards that have
been given to me and I don't even know
what's in there and I keep my receipts
and candles in there and then I've got a
screwdriver because I'm a bit of a DIY
lady and if I need to screw things
together I know where to find my
screwdriver so you guys might have
noticed that my wards are mainly white
and the reason is is that I just like a
room that's quite peaceful and relaxing
and I can always add color like I've
added in this photo here which is well
this picture here which says love but I
can always change like the color and the
theme of the room easily with photos but
if I painted the walls and I can't do
that here I just have like a photo from
our wedding that's been blown up and
then I've also got this jewelry stand is
when I've got another one over there but
I never wear the jewelry there and then
I'm not gonna go through this drawer
because currently it is in a state of
dire dire mess and I've not worked up
what I'm going to use it for now because
I've moved most of my makeup over here
now and I've had a really good massive
declutter so I'm gonna work out what I'm
gonna do is stuff here but I just give
you an idea
I've got trays or like put products and
stuff let's see what's in this next one
all right okay so yeah there's like
eyelashes over here few brushes lots of
palettes that I just don't use and stuff
I'm really not a makeup girl so I really
need to kind of clear this out and
decide what I want to do in it so moving
on to this part of the room it looks
right there because this is what I call
the new things well again if you guys
check out my blog months of style.com
you'll see that I have this rail to
basically store things that I buy new
and it means that I can kind of see
everything and decide if I actually want
to keep it and it's really helped me in
deciding what I need what I don't need
when I'm overspending when I could buy
more things so these are just like
things that I bought yesterday and the
prior to that it's all been clear I just
bought some shoes as well which I'll
show in a blogs over here is the section
under the window and I've just got a
little safer area here and this is
actually a sofa bed so if anyone comes
to stay over they can pull it out and
stay on there and it's really
comfortable Archie Maureen has stayed
over twice here before and I love these
pillow cases they're actually a silk
which I bought from Thailand so I think
it's really cute and I used to have the
cow pillows but for this I just thought
yeah let me bring out all the nice stuff
it's me garden there's me garden you
guys can see in my garden and basically
I've got mini curtains and my curtains
which are again from Ikea the reason I
haven't gone for thick curtains is one
because obviously this isn't my bedroom
I don't we don't sleep in it I don't
sleep in here but I just wanted
something light and airy and yeah we
don't have anyone who can look into us
here so it's really cool if I want to
stand naked by the window and I've got
this um I think it's got a clapping
board from YouTube and my youtube
headphones I went to an event an event
and I got these and they're so cool I
love them and then I've also got this
cock here which is from Matt's like I
believe it's from my plan and then
another set of faux flowers again
because I can't keep real flowers alive
but I think these look nice and then
this is my teddy bear called Henry I've
had Henry for probably about twelve
years when I was in hospital with a
duodenal also
so Henry's been given to me can't for
the life of me remember who gave me an
me but you know he's a big part of my
life
love you Henry yeah he doesn't love me
okay
so I'm just gonna show you this area
here this is actually where I keep my
bags and but then I have bags that have
a regular rotation which have another
corner but I store a lot of bags in
there and I can fit probably about eight
know about five bags in each of those
things and I bought those from Matlin
the reason I've not kind of got my bags
all lined up because I hate actually
hate having things on show I think it's
really tacky well I say that I don't
I've got my shoe cupboard here but I
don't really like having things I'll
show because I think it makes it look
messy but I think these are a great way
to store it I can just pull it down when
I want a bag but you know four bags that
are in regular rotation I just keep them
in this corner and I pull them out or I
also put them in that corner and just
pull them out so guys this is my shoe
cupboard a food for you guys have seen
these and mentioned these before I'll
just open it quickly those are some of
my shoes and I've got others elsewhere
but yeah I just you guys suggested that
I do it backwards forwards backwards
forwards back to forwards and it means
that I can get a lot more shoes in on
each level so thank you guys for that
suggestion and yeah I have more shoes
which I keep downstairs things I don't
need I want to be happily getting rid of
so that's my shoe collection so got the
Cowboys buying just for you guys
let's get passionate so this is just
another like surface that sometimes get
ready here and these are some drawers
which were Michael's from his old
property but I just bring them in here
and it's really good storage actually
and over here I have some candles I have
this Cup but I want to show you guys
this Cup actually because this was a
wedding gift and it's been really cool
it this massive teacup has kept my joy
in it for a long time it's now housing
actual fake flowers again but I love it
I think it's so so cute so yeah and I
just got these candles from IKEA which
smell really minion eyes and brighten up
the room
here and there and then I've got this
numbers settle this come are so heavy so
I've got this
it's a light-up mirror but I hate the
color on it it's really weird so I just
use it there I've got another mirror
over there as well I've got another set
of these jaw storage containers here as
well because again I just used my
everyday make not my makeup my everyday
skin care products and like deodorants
and eyelash glue and the things that I
literally pull out every morning on top
of it a lot with my hair brushes as well
and some other things there so I use
that daily and then I I don't I'm not
among the massive perfume girl but I've
got a couple of perfumes just there and
then I have this stand up mirror so I
can see myself hello
there's a lot of feet there yeah just I
get ready sometimes over here in the
morning when I wanna have a look at
myself then we've got a little window at
the corner of my house which is really
cool then here's my laundry basket which
is lovely but I'll quickly show you this
carpet I love this cop here is add some
colour to the room and just smooth and
it looks like a really traditional style
you guys may be not seeing I've got my
wood floors here which are in a chestnut
kind of color I love these so let's look
at this side of the room this is my
wardrobe and I just store all my clothes
in here backside is completely full this
side is part full I might just give you
a quick peek
yeah you guys it's kind of so it is kind
of organized and I keep my short skirts
jeans t-shirts shirts down here I keep
my jumpers jackets dresses and work wear
so I'm a bit of an OCD I do keep things
quite organized but it's just a lot
easier and then in there I keep hats and
belts and scarves and things like that
so yeah that's my wardrobe one day I'll
go through it but again I'm not a
massive hold on up I've had a massive
clear out so I feel quite proud of
myself because I'm just trying to
minimize the amount of stuff I have and
these are as you can see these are
sliding wardrobes so they're really cool
they're double high and I'm able to keep
a lot of stuff in there so that's what
that looks like on my chair is also from
I care and I've got this little storage
pouf is where this is I'll show you guys
inside actually so inside here I keep
blow dryers straighteners curling tongs
curling wands rollers hot rollers and I
think this is amazing I love the floral
print I used to use it as a seat when we
just moved in and it was only 20 pounds
from Matlin
it's a massive bargain you guys have got
to see my cat calendar for all of you
cat lovers oh I love my cat calendar
it's one tesco really really cute I love
it so guys that's it this is my room
tour what my closet room tour not my
bedroom cool so guys that is my room
tour as you can see and this isn't my
bedroom tour few people have been a bit
confused and like us if me my husband
sleep in separate rooms which is a
little weird question to ask this is
like a spare bedroom which I've
transformed into like a closet room and
I have my own personal well we have our
own personal bedroom and I'm lucky
enough to have a space which I can call
my own for shoes and clothes and random
things so I'm very happy about this
space but I hope you enjoy and you can
