in light of the whole back-to-school
experience and I thought I'm gonna tell
you my university story my college story
and start off where like finish off
where I was before and trying like give
you guys some insight into what it was
like for me like growing up I'm kind of
old now probably can't tell mm-hmm but I
want to go ahead and tell you this way
if you guys want to hear my uni story
then let me know but I'm gonna just tell
my College story for now but leave a
comment below if you want to hear
University one so let's talk about
College
and I'm gonna try and break it down for
my first job guys
grades and like how I decided moving on
and stuff like that so College is where
you go between the ages of 16 and 18
after you've been in secondary school I
don't really know what that breaks down
if you're stateside or
elsewhere but 16 to 18 you go there and
this is kind of like big schools so you
already feel like I'm a college now you
know what College and but the thing is
is that my mom didn't let me actually go
to college I worked he went to sick form
so sixth form is actually an extension
of the school where people go to where
they're 11 to 16 and they have like 600
on top of that because my mom was like
Patricia oh you're just too wild to go
to college I think it was the best
decision made for me because I ended up
going to a fairly good school that had a
fairly good sixth form as well finally
in our that school was like a rival
school to the school that I'd gone on
before so I knew some of the people I
didn't know them but I'd seen them
before and I think these people are so
neeki like I thought they were saying no
because it's quite a nerdy's yeah it was
definitely nobody school in my opinion
and so and a lot of the guys he said
they used to hate me because they used
to see when the bus not hate me but I
was really loud like I've always been
really loud and really like hi
like I'm sitting on the boss and stuff
like that and I can't sing but me my
friends that have like quite a practice
quiet practice being Cisco song song on
the on the bus I could imagine us being
fairly annoying so yeah but the funny
thing is that 13 tries to see anything
on there so Nikki they became like some
of my really really close friends and
stuff like that so this point in time I
had got my first job no yeah yeah I
think I just started my first jobs I
started working when I was 16 and I got
job in House of Fraser working for coast
so that's where I got my passion for
fashion not really because the coast
clothes are granting it and they used to
have to leave College worried because
you have to wear their clothing and
their clothings like prom clothing so
you said this little long promise that
that was like sateen leave college see
all their like other college people in
my maxi skirt it was just so
cringe-worthy but yeah that wasn't my
first job and that was really amazing so
let me talk about like my friends and
stuff like that definitely
I made my closest friends and my
bridesmaids and just people who I love
the most when I was at college I feel
that he you you'll grow up a bit but you
think you're growing but you're not
actually as grown as you think you are
but you know I just in the first year of
college I had the most amazing time like
we just had so much fun it was just
jokes the common room was amazing it was
just social everyone got on really
really well and it was not like it's not
a bit cheap place probably because I'm
no boys but we don't know fancy ball
boys at all so there was never this kind
of oh my god she likes him she's no no
no no a certain seed nobody know so we
could all interact him that really fresh
strong friendship level and that was
just amazing and in terms of what
courses I did I did biology chemistry
psychology yes those are that is levels
that I did and I went I went like you
know I was kind of smart people I was
kind of small there was only one guy who
got grades higher than me in biology
psychology as okay I was here and there
and but biology was my course I
absolutely loved Sciences
I love science especially biology I
think it's like really really
interesting so I loved it and I was
quite good at it let's talk about second
year let's talk about second year where
it got dramatic so this means that we're
now at the top of the year and then a
new bunch of students came in and lo and
behold a boy came in and I don't know
what's wrong with me I always pick weird
boys like this guy is not like it wasn't
the most amazing-looking go and you
think like that but I liked his
personality and I'm definitely a
personality person and he was very very
extreme and I used to think maybe he's a
little bit autistic because he doesn't
have any empathy didn't care who he hurt
in in his behavior his behavior was just
like are you normal but it was very very
extreme and I think I just like extreme
personalities that wasn't the best you
know there was a lot of things that
happened here and there and mean things
that he did and I was like I can't
believe I'm still here after you did
this after you did that I was like why
do I still like you so in terms of it
affecting my grades it really really did
affect my grades like I went from top
guru who never went to biology class
because he in whenever he had free time
that's when I had biology lo and behold
you would find me in the common room
when I should be reading my book and we
do come on room so it really really
definitely impacted me and even impacted
my friendships because all my friends
were like what do you see in this boy
he's actually a beast he's actually a
diamond I'm so people refer to him as
diamond because he wasn't the nicest guy
and like after a while that see my
friends are just like haha like whatever
cuz I can't I say oh my god she did this
oh my god she did that and then I'm like
you're so stupid I wish I'd listened to
my friends at the time but sometimes you
get overwhelmed and it affected my
grades blah blah blah and I was even I
was so stressed out by the whole thing I
ended up in hospital I had a duodenal
ulcer what did that like is caused by
stressed and that's how extreme it was
and from that perspective but and I
don't act like even till the end of U of
college I liked him to the very end
and and then some became and then I grew
up and I was like Oh Lord what was I
thinking and I haven't seen him in like
seven years and so in terms of you cast
now deciding to get on to go to
university all I knew is that my parents
had always told me you must go to
university and you must be a lawyer
because I like to talk a lot and I will
debate with you and I was like I'm gonna
be a rebel I like fashion I'm gonna do
international fashion marketing and I
didn't really even think I didn't think
about career prospects I just did what I
wanted to do and I know my dad was like
yeah you're not serious Patricia but I
was quite red rebellious by that point
in time I don't know I'm gonna do that
but my parents walked it she's going to
university she'll see sense and
everything it will be all right and it
turns out amazingly which I'll tell in
my university story but um I didn't
really have much help like putting the
you Castform together because god bless
my parents they don't really know the
process they just thought you must go to
university and that was it so I didn't
really proofread my my application form
and I didn't really have anyone to
encourage me to do it but like honestly
I would love to ensure that when people
are doing that if you need help then let
me know like I would definitely like to
help people because I think you need
people to give you advice on how to like
presents often and now I know that I
definitely know how the process works
when it comes to applications and stuff
like that so yeah but I got it I got
into University and I did okay at the
end I got one be a see no to bees and to
C's which is like when I could have got
basic I could have got A's
but I left the second year kind of
failure and actually my first year
grades and actually what bumped me up
I'm gonna end on this I'm gonna end on
by this point in time I told you my
parents never them used to let me out
but now as a bit old I was and I was out
so my parents let me have my own house
party when I was believe I was so it was
my 17th birthday party and by this point
in time we had moved into like a really
nice area of really nice house like it's
very very very suburbia and it's a
little bit posh it's a little bit
pushing people a bit like oh you've knew
that Ian oh yeah oh yeah baby wait he
now
here so I was like oh my gosh I must
have a party and like I remember me and
my best friend like planning this party
like okay we're gonna vote this person
this person blah blah blah and it was in
my mom's house and my parents were not
leaving the house with me they'll be in
the house and I thought to myself not a
lot of people gonna come anyway because
where I live is really really far well
it's not really really far but it's in
the suburbs and it's not going to be
easy for people to find like where I
live or just get here and I thought okay
I'm not too worried about people
crashing or anything like that so like
brought two outfits I'm like white dress
Patricia white it's not to a wedding day
and then like some black dress or like
sequins on the shoulder and I remember
like when my house was getting full I
was like really nervous that only people
were coming people clean like music
playing and everything I felt like I was
so cool but I spent half the time up
here with my best friend like screaming
like it's coming is he coming is he
coming he's coming and so he came and he
came with a bunch of my random people
all those loads of random people ended
up turning up as well but everything was
cool everyone was kushti and the funny
thing was my parents and I had told them
to guys
I don't want you to share your faces
here right so my dad my dad's one of
those very simple after comments okay he
went upstairs you didn't see him again
my mom is one of those typical African
women she can't help herself but get
involved next thing so there's it like
we were all in the front living room and
like the lights were off and the music
was playing whatever you know it goes be
cool like that I saw my mom just turned
on the light share the tray of biscuits
that she came and she's like does
anybody want a piece keys I was like mom
this is a party nobody wants biscuits at
a party but the funny thing is that
everyone was like oh it was so funny I
was like mom please go upstairs okay
sorry
so yeah I knew she just wanted to come
and see what was going on just being
nosey but I was hilarious and then at
this point in time we were kind of girly
girls but we loved like grime music and
and Dipset I was really really into dick
my girls like I'm having I never think
that goes like I said like something
like Dipset or even know who they were
but we really like them so let's talk
about the party so at this point in time
songs like pow do you rent out anyway
that song got people major major height
and the song came on literally everybody
when you say everybody was jumping like
how the house with power my mom lips he
came running down the stairs I was like
what is going on I thought justin
darlington and then she went back
upstairs and then um more songs came on
everyone it was just vibes and having a
really really good time and then Juelz
dips it was it know if it was dips in
something came on and then the Harrelson
and literally again the house was
shaking and everyone was I just noise my
dad came down the stairs and when dad
comes down the stairs you know it's over
he literally came in right he turned on
the light said okay he's time to go home
everybody out like that so full video my
dad turned on the lights and sent
everybody home oh my gosh it was so
embarrassing
but it was like so amazing at the same
time I fought all my life I don't think
I'll ever forget that part either
feeling everything it was just the most
amazing thing I had such an amazing time
I was definitely a highlight of my
college story or that ended a little bit
badly when some group of hoodlums
smashed all the cars and like free cars
got smashed on the road and in the
morning we have the neighborhood watch
you know like um in this area those kind
of things don't actually happen we know
you're new here but and then my mom was
really really angry
and I was in trouble but it was worth it
it was worth it and that is the end of
my college story if you want my
university story then just leave a
comment and I will definitely do that
for you guys
so see you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
