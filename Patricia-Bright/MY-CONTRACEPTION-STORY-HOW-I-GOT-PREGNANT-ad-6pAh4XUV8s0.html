video we're going to get a little bit up
close and personal and I wanted to talk
about contraception I want to share a
little bit about my story what I have
used and what I am currently using as a
contraceptive method I thought it was
nice one because I'm just trying to be a
little bit more open and it useful on
this channel and I love watching videos
like this anyway I was going to say if
you're not old enough to watch this
video but actually I've been just
important for all ladies to understand
their bodies and know what options they
have for them
so I just wanted to cover yet but I'm
not professional I'm not a doctor or a
nurse or a sexual health practitioner if
you do have any key questions or issues
please do ask a professional I'm just a
guy on the internet who wants to share
my story with you guys right so let's
take it back I started taking content
section when I was around 18 19 and
actually wasn't because I was sexually
active is because I have really heavy
painful periods and there is nothing
like being doubled over not being able
to go to lectures or classes and crying
and just being in agony for just a
couple of days is the worst thing ever
and people really don't understand and
struggle and I'm not saying sitting and
saying that I have it the but I know
people who have excelled badly it's
actually a real medical issue just to be
in a lot of pain and I just wanted an
option so my GP suggested that I could
try going on the pill and I only said oh
my God my Mother's Day I want that but I
was at uni at that point in time so I
bet you know what my mum doesn't know
I'm going on the pill but so yeah I was
on the pill and the best thought I went
on was the combined pill so I think the
bill was called by micro kernel and it
contains progesterone and estrogen in
synthetic form I need to basically work
one by thinning the lining of the womb
as well as increasing the mucus so about
99% effective best but I took that for
about a year and a half to two years and
it really did help with reducing my
period
Payne for sure and you basically don't
really have a period it's actually
called a breakthrough bleed I took the
pill for 21 days stop for seven days you
have a breakthrough bleed and then you
start again but I won't lie I wasn't
that worried about the side effect I was
just happy to not really have periods
and that were very heavy or painful
anymore and it definitely worked but I
know that people were worried about
weight gain I didn't have that and a few
other things and such as deep veins on
braces that kind of stuff
but because I was young active didn't
smoke but those kind of stuff are very
low risk for however the thing that I
really felt like is but it was impacting
me emotionally I felt like I was just
drop here now now that I'm off of it I
realized that you know during that time
of the month
you are quite stroppy but I didn't want
anything that was going to make that
work so I actually ended up stopping
taking that and not being on any form of
contraception at all so while sorting on
to getting married and stuff this is a
point in time where I wanted to take my
contraception very very seriously so
firstly we started off using condoms and
now basically 98% effective which is
relatively effective and most of times
the reason why they don't work is
because of user failure so something
happens with the individuals which
didn't happen so I'll talk about net but
yeah we started off using condoms just
because I hadn't looked at what my
contraceptive options were I felt like I
really didn't want to be on the tool
because I didn't want to remember to
take one every day but I hadn't really
done my research
so condoms were actually the first thing
that we started using and you know what
they work I do feel like they don't make
everything as amazing as it normally
would be I don't want to get too much
into it for here I would say that that
is definitely and the case for myself
and therefore like if you get a big team
vigorous and a bit too too too excited
with condoms that sometimes accidents
happen we ended up actually having I
think two accidents
and with the loss of a corn dog and I
hate going into too much detail but yeah
it definitely happens and so the option
that I end up taking was a morning-after
pill which is I believe it called 11 L
and that space it contains a high amount
of progesterone which is a hormone that
basically Dickens aligners and meters
and also prevent you from releasing and
egg and that is basically will prevent
you from getting pregnant and again I do
say that it makes you feel quite ill and
quite nauseas but in option if you do
have an accident so moving on I looked
at the IUD and the iuf which is
basically the copper coil and the other
t-shape I assumed it was a releases
hormones these logs a really long time
these were not an option for me because
I didn't want anything that was going to
be inserted because I was really really
worried about having heavy periods and
extreme period pain is something that I
have eventually learned to manage with
by basically taking medication
beforehand and after enduring and I
didn't want anything I was going to make
that work for me so that wasn't an
option and then I looked at the implants
the implants is something that is
inserted into the arm underneath here
and it also contains progesterone which
is slowly released into your body
I believe it lasts up to three years so
you can have it in there and you kind of
think some women feel like they have
heavier periods someone with it that
they have no periods at all however when
I was at researching into this and
finding out that there are some people
who have periods for like and you know
it's like three months straight I was
like no I can't I can't do it I just
couldn't do it I just that wasn't an
option to me it's not something I want
to do and I also had quite a regular
cycle so funnily enough I ended up back
on the pill but I ended up on the one
that would just progesterone only rather
than a progesterone and estrogen I'm not
quite sure why that was recommended from
by my doctor but that's what they
suggested so again I felt like it would
have
in impact for me emotionally if I but
you know what this is not for me and I
actually ended up just stopping taking
the pill full stop and I was right we're
going to use condoms again mmm you know
when you're married that using condoms
is just not a thing that people want to
do so what I do when it comes to my
contraception is that I use natural
family planning and a method of
contraception
it's actually about 99% effective if
done correctly and it has been around
for forever it's like the oldest form of
contraception and it's all about
basically knowing about your own body
and how it works the analogy is that
there are only a couple days in a month
where a woman can actually get pregnant
and it's when she has relieved an egg
and it is ready to be fertilized other
than that you can't actually get
pregnant in the month and it's quite
important as ladies to kind of know what
is going on in your body are you
obviating are you not ovulating but it
does take a while to understand how your
body works and a lot of people don't
really wanna turn and check themselves
properly to know when stuff is going on
in their system and the body is amazing
because there are little ways that your
body changes when you ovulate anyway I
currently use an app called natural
cycles and this is a really good app
when it comes to monitoring and working
out when you are at risk of pregnancy or
not this is the app that I use here baby
says use protection lickable might be
close to oscillating and what I have is
a thermometer as well this is a summer
now this is a thermometer thermometer
yeah this is a thermometer which you use
every morning just to work out your body
temperature so when you're ovulating
your body actually changes temperature
during that period of time and what
happens that if you keep checking every
day you'll see kind of very steady
temperature until you're ovulating and
you'll see a change and that is a period
of time where you're high at risk of
getting pregnant because you might have
just released an egg or an egg is
already like in your room it's actually
the only
you regulations approved contraception
app so it's really really good it works
really well as I mean it's a good
alternative to taking hormone all I do
is measure my temperature every day put
that data into the app keep doing it
consistently and it is able to work out
how my cycle is or when I'm highly
likely to be up in 18 or not which i
think is great after that another
natural method is also to have a look at
your mucus or look at what's going on on
the inside you may need to use two
special fingers or either one as you
know probably only one actually and what
it is is that during your cycle your
mucus actually changes quite a bit and
you'll be able to tell the difference
between when you're not ovulating and
when you are because what your body is
either is preparing you to pad you know
sperm coming up in there and fertilizing
your egg or not and so if you keep
checking new keep monitoring you'll be
able to see that there's a consistent
change in what your body produces so
basically how I ended up getting
pregnant is because I was using natural
methods I actually stopped using
contraception for about a year and a
half prior a year and hearthfire I just
stopped and actually we've been going
quite well you know doing the deed or
the kind of good stuff and actually
we're quite consistent I wasn't really
tracking it tracking it but I knew kind
of more you know I feel like around now
I might be ovulating so let's not all
we're using the method butters which
isn't the most reliable however and we
were in we are in a committed and
long-term relationship and we were in a
position of you know if we get right now
we get pregnant if we don't get pregnant
we go and one or something we're
thinking about or trying for and I
remember literally it was one vigorous
encounter I really got a bit carried
away and didn't you know and then yeah
we had a baby and as the amazing grace
with us now
so and now I definitely know I do not
want to get pregnant I am using the
natural cycles app to make sure that I
just keep on top of my schedule it's
really good really easy to do and just
being aware of your
something I think that every woman
should do whether they're trying for a
baby or not with label contraception
methods or not just being on top of that
kind of stuff is very important for guys
that is the end of this video I really
hope you enjoyed it and found it useful
and that is a bit TMI at some point in
time well sometimes it's obvious that if
you have to kind of share a little bit
more by a transceiver or PG as much as
possible
I will have the natural cycles at in my
description bar below please do download
it and become a cycler if you are
looking at finding more natural or
alternative forms of contraception but
in the meantime I'll catch you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
