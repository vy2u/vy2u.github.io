I'm gonna show you how I recreate a
first look here and I'm gonna try and do
like my current favorite face once in a
while because I get so many products and
I never really use them or and the whole
thing about doing YouTube and being new
to but is showing people what's out
there what's good how does it actually
look on a face like mine and then you
guys can decide just for yourself about
something you you like or don't like and
I know people are very quick to say no
Patricia that doesn't look good I think
it's really really funny but this is a
look I'm gonna see today it's really
quick and simple and it's kind of medium
medium to high arrange products again
you guys know I don't really do
drugstore tutorials but I do have a
collection of really good drugstore
products that I am building up right now
so I will do that for you guys real soon
so in the meantime I will catch you all
later and yeah if you're not subscribed
already make sure you do and see over on
the ground and all that good stuff
now guys bye you guys probably know by
now that I usually keep my makeup
relatively simple I'm using the
invisible from Mourad as my primer and I
love it it's got SPF in it and it just
makes my makeup really nice and matte
and go on really smooth and I just find
it beautiful and the foundation I'm
going in is the Clinique beyond
perfecting foundation the color I wear
is twenty-eight clove and this is a
foundation that I kind of slept on but
now it's made its way to my main
collection because this foundation is
life yes not a fan of the applicator but
everything else about it I love and I
don't know if any of you guys I like me
but I always feel like I'm late to the
party when it comes to everything but I
finally got my hands on some morphe
brushes and I got these occult Beauty I
don't know if you guys know about
Beauty but it's like amazing for really
good like brands that are you know maybe
easier to get in the US and that you
can't really find easily in the stores
here and they've got so many the brands
that um that everyone on youtube talks
about and I always feel like I'm late to
the party like I never get this stuff on
time like everybody
use YouTube struggles youtuber struggles
want in the product exclusive I've just
started getting colour-pop as well and
then we'll rants and raves about the
morphe brushes i think what it is is
that they're really affordable and
people want good quality affordable
products and obviously some of the top
YouTube girls always talk about more
feet as well so that makes them much
more popular and so I'm gonna move on to
my brows and I'm gonna tell you guys
that I basically went through a process
of looking for every single drugstore
brown pencil that I could possibly find
and then trying on and finding the one
that works best for me and I ended up
with this matte effect at excessive
intensity it is a an eyeliner but I use
eyeliner on brows anyway and I found the
color to be perfect the text should be
to be perfect and it was relatively
affordable and it's one of the ones that
you scrolled up but the only thing is is
that I don't think it's gonna last me
very long but so far so good it's a
phase and I'm going in with the Urban
Decay weightless complete coverage
concealer and I've been using this for a
few months now and I do count it as a
favorite and I've talked about it loads
of times I love it under my brows under
my eyes just all over and to be honest
the concealer brush on this I don't like
it this is from Lancome I really don't
like it but I can't find my other one
honestly concealer hides a multitude of
sins cuz right now
my eyebrows are desperate for a thread
in Mike's super desperate I go ahead and
I highlight the tip of my nose and I
hate when I do my highlight like
slightly off-center because it really
does give you a bent lookin Norris but
it happens cuz I don't have a steady
hand
and this brush that I'm using is from
bareMinerals and it is the diffuser
shade and diffuse I brush I think it's
amazing for concealer contour I'm just
using a brown eyeshadow that I have
because I can't find my normal
foundation I'm just gonna carefully tap
that on and use my fingers after that
I'm gonna go ahead with the sascha and
put that onto my eyes I don't really
bake I just kind of let it set for a
little bit and I now try to always bring
out my powder just closer to the bridge
of my nose because it really does help
with the kind of highlighting and
contouring and I find it way more
flattering on me
makeups one of those things that it
takes a while for you to really get what
works for you but once you get it you
just keep doing it and that obviously
from YouTube I've learnt so so much I
just use a very tip to try and get it on
there the way I love the black beauty
blender it just hides all the crustiness
but I do watch them I believe the Beauty
Blender I really on so we don't know if
that's a bad thing or not I'm going to
use this Sigma soft angled contour brush
to just brush everything off so I'm
gonna go ahead and use this morphe
palette I know when you have a new
palette and it just feels like
everything like look at this
it's literally porn like you just want
to lick it how tasty does that look yes
and I'm gonna go in with a brown and
bronze sorry guys you know what I'm like
and this brush is so nice
honestly this palette is me all over
simple but with a little bit of edge I'm
gonna go in around here for the color in
my crease
and I'm gonna go ahead with a bit more
Brown to just diffuse the out cuz I'm
not feeling that purple me don't know
why I'm so anti color what colors do you
think would suit me guys I liked you and
its blended that looks like everything
that's pretty
I'm loving this that kind of gold and
bronze just do and then I'm gonna go
ahead with my mascara it's the false
lash sculpt from L'Oreal and I have told
you guys how much I love this mascara
haven't I this everything like it just
gets up and in there specially because
I've got such clarity lashes and the
lashes i'm going in with are the new set
of naked lashes from them i have a
coupon code in the description bar below
i always have a coupon code and I picked
up this random weed glue when I was in
Berlin wait why does it look like I
don't know it's like fluorescent kind of
scared but it sticks really well but no
can you guys see that color
it's literally fluorescent it looks like
it should not be on the skin
now this is a super simple up but I'm
going to add just a little bit of gold
and if you guys know my warm neutrals
palette is a palette that basically gets
used every single day I don't feel like
I can do a look without this palette and
I just add a little bit of gold just
here and I'm gonna use it on my morphe
fan brush this fan brush here man
is life you see life man is life and
then I'm gonna use the Jack King hill
with a collaboration of Becca cosmetics
I know there's quite a lot of drama
behind this palette but I got a good
palette and I actually really really
like it so I'm gonna talk about it in my
favorites at some point in time but I
know everyone has different palettes but
mine was great so I'm just gonna add
some highlight just going to add some
shown things up and it's so pigmented
like I really need to be careful not to
overdo it and I'm going to use the Becca
luminous blush in the color called
Delilah mine's cracks
I dropped here but it's still all good
we're good here now I'm just gonna add a
touch of highlight on my tip top lip and
I try not to overdo it because sometimes
when you do it you can it like got a
bogey just coming out compressing your
top lip like it's not a good look for my
favorite news gloss I'm using this Aran
gloss which is the colors called weekday
and this for me is you know weekday such
a casual look and I'm using a brown
liner which is a doughnut from Kiko
I've had it for a really long time
this is actually my favorite nude like
glossy makeup look I feel like I need a
little bit more color on my cheeks
actually so I've got this Becca beached
in in a color called Roseberry you can
use it on your cheeks and your lips yeah
little bit more color now when you do
like neutrals you do need a little bit
more so guys that is the end of my
tutorial I hope you guys enjoyed that
I'm gonna try and do a face of like the
week or the season once in a while so I
get to use the products that I've got in
my collection because I get so many
products and I never use them all and I
mean just to give you guys in there with
insight into what I'm not currently
liking and enjoy him and I guys I will
see you all later bye only thing I had
on my CV before I was 16 can I ask a
question about the financial markets
what do you see I don't was that yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
