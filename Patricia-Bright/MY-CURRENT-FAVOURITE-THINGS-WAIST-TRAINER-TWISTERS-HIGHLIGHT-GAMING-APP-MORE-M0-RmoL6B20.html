much that they are expensive but they're
lining up just girl just so good hey
guys welcome up to my channel today I've
got a favorites video and I don't
usually do favorites I don't do them
like every single month I really try to
save them to when I've got some things
that I actually really really really
love and really want to share with you
guys that I get really excited about and
you guys know that I'm very much an
excitable person anyway so I'm gonna go
ahead and get started I've got some
Beauty favorites and some other randoms
as well so we're gonna go ahead and
share these with you so everybody knows
that I'm a foodie I love my food and I'm
not ashamed to say it
food is life and I have found these mini
twisters and I've shared many twisters
with you guys in the past in a favorite
however these are many twisters with the
twist because these are not your classic
Limon strawberry
these are black currant and strawberry
and vanilla flavor this is a new flavor
that I've never seen in all my 20 years
of eating twisters because I've been
eating them since I was a kid and I love
them I've never seen this flavor and I
saw these in my tests code but you might
be able to find them I'm sure everywhere
else and I was like oh what's this let
me tell you that I eat four of these in
a city and I'm not even ashamed to say
at a four and they are absolutely
delicious if you don't know about normal
twist this firstly start off with a
normal and then you need to go on to
these but these are amazing so my next
favorite is ridiculously addictive I
don't know how much Tuchman how much
thought it's a game called best fiends
and the guys from besting did contact me
and did send me this game I'm telling
you that my level of love in this game
is seriously real I have been playing it
I'm like one level 21 22 whatever right
now and it's so good to play you
basically have to match up different
colors or strawberries and flowers and
leaves whatever and then you
set challenges to basically either kill
slugs or clip a certain number of
flowers or mushrooms or whatever it is
it's so so good for those of you who
don't know I'm actually breastfeeding so
it means that I get up at least two
times a night to feed and each feeds
about thirty minutes including wingding
and all that kind of thing and I can't
really you know watch TV or put on you
know a movie because that kind of
disturbs the baby but I've got my hands
and while she's like sucking I can go
ahead and play and it's been so so
useful just to kind of keep me and also
I might add that I know that it is at
Mother's Day on the 8th of May in the
USA Canada and Australia and the guys at
Best Fiend
are showing their appreciation for all
the mothers out there hey inside the app
there's gonna be a Mother's Day card
where you can get lots of game currency
to basically help you get to more and
more levels I have a link in the
description bar below where you guys can
check out the app and you can also get
it from the Apple App Store and Google
Play so my next favorite after that is
actually my belly wrap and I bought this
belly wrap on Amazon I'm currently
wearing it and I've seen waist trainers
stuff like that and I actually ended up
buying a belly band ear which is like a
post pregnancy bandit thing it didn't
really last for very long and the
reality is that your stomach kind of
goes down anyway during pregnancy and I
feel like the belly band it didn't work
so much and it was about 70 pounds it
was a very expensive product but then I
went onto Amazon and I found this link
and this this product was 12 pounds and
it's so so so good it holds me in it's
much tighter and much more secure then
the belly band ear and I found that it
also helps create kind of like a waist
as well while I try to kind of hold
everything in I got a bit of diastasis
recti which I will link in the
description bar below because baby was
actually quite big she's like 8 pounds
it caused a separation in my abdomen but
what happened is that basically my
stomach expanded and kind of split it's
not painful it's just the muscles so
what I'm doing is I'm actually wearing
the waist the waist trainer it's not a
natural waist trainer it's kind of like
a support belt to help with my posture
to help my back and also to help kind of
bringing those my
was back together which will happen in
time and then I can go ahead and do the
exercises that I need to do to really
firm up my core muscles but I found it
really really comfortable to wear it's
really affordable and actually kind of
creates a little bit of curves so it was
a bargain I'll link it down below next I
am going to move on to some beauty boots
that I'm absolutely loving firstly I'm
going to share with you some hair or a
hair product you guys have seen I've
been wearing my curly hair extensions
they are from white hair and I'm loving
it I feel really like flirting like
summery in the curly hair and and what I
do every single day if you watch my get
ready with me you'll see what I did or
every other day I kind of wet my hair
and I drench it in conditioner to really
keep the curls nice and secure I've been
using the eff either dry remedy
moisturizing conditioner which is
excelente it's not too heavy and doesn't
leave you if like crispy crispy curls
like it feels really soft and not like
this product stuck in my hair love it
love it love it so my next Beauty
favorite isn't actually a physical
beauty favorite bright it is a tool from
the ponds Institute and I don't know if
you guys know last year I went to New
York with ponds which is an amazing
Beauty brand which has got so much
history and they're not massive in the
UK they're really big in the u.s. really
big in like Africa and Asia and they
invited me out to be part of an insider
program and they've created basically
this tool but that uses facial
recognition and what you do is you kind
of type in what your skin ailment is
being acne discoloration aging wrinkles
whatever you can take a picture of
yourself and what they do is recommend
other product for things that you can do
for your skin based on the imagery and I
think that's amazing not only that
they've got so much information on their
site about acne the causes of acne the
cause of discoloration why you have
hyperpigmentation and I just think it's
amazing I mean it's easy to recommend
loads of products but sometimes it's
really important to know that there's a
lot of research and science behind the
product
you actually want them to work and I
have found in the past that my skincare
videos always do well because I take my
skincare so seriously and I take the
science behind skin skin seriously and
actually while I was in New York on this
trip as amazing I got to meet loads of
different girls from all over the world
and I actually got to go to the labs as
well to actually see what they do and to
look at the kind of you know science and
biology that goes into it it wasn't a
joke and you guys know that biology was
like my favorite subject but I can a in
biology okay Mergent say that but
biology is one of my favorite subjects
and I think people know how much I love
the science of it so to physically go
into the lab see the research page
papers and the innovations that they
came up with in the world of skin
technology has just been absolutely
amazing so I definitely advise you guys
to check out the my skin advisor tool on
the pons app I'm gonna have a link in
the description bar below
so my next Beauty favorite is what I
feel like I've showed you guys these
before but I get arts about this all the
time which is what lashes are you
wearing Patricia
like there's not a day that goes by that
not a picture that somebody doesn't ask
this question now I feel like I say all
the time I link it in the description
box all the time but I'm gonna come out
and say that they have the lower lashes
and I have a coupon code usually
hopefully it was this time sometimes it
works sometimes it doesn't
but I'm not gonna lie I love the lashes
so so much they are expensive but if
you've got a special occasion they're
worth it
the pen that I love are called ami up
and winging it those are my two
favorites and I think I'm currently
wearing winging it
right now so it's done and dusted now
you know after that this is a new
product but it is literally life it is
actually the this highlighter from
Illamasqua
now if you see the level of glow edge
can you see that level of glow edge oh
just go just so good so so so gorgeous
and I think this is a highlighter that
will work on every and any skin tone
it's just it's just fabulous it's just
fabulous darlings and I love it and I've
also
this new morphe brush that I'm also
gonna save the favor as it's not new
I've had it for like since December but
I've never mentioned it this and this
honey honey I love it brush I like life
last two things it's this murad
invisiblur perfecting shield
broad-spectrum it's kind of like a
primer you put it on before you put on
your makeup this is amazing because it's
an SPF of factor 30 but it's not greasy
it's like the opposite of a grease to
have an SPF that is matte a massive
innovation amazing I'm loving it
it's really really good you put it on
your face or neck before you put on
makeup or you can wear it alone it gives
you kind of a blur effect it kind of
reminds me of benefit Porefessional like
that kind of primer but much nicer like
it's seriously ridiculous it feels like
it feels like silk like you're putting
silk on your face and then you put your
makeup over it and it keeps it nice and
matte and you have the sun protection
finally it is a liquid liner this is the
I think it's called the master ink from
Maybelline and I love this because I
really do struggle with the liquid liner
everyone else wears it and makes it look
so luscious and gorgeous but when I do
it it just looks a hot mess like a hot
hot mess I mean because I've just got
these really small eyelids or something
but this eyeliner here is like I need
like ten of these especially when it's
like new and fresh they're so so good
and they're so affordable as well so
this is a kind of charcoal black and
it's a matte liner and it gives me a
really nice winged look so guys those
are my current ultimate favorites at the
moment I don't know when there'll be
another one but these are the things
that are giving me life right about now
and I hope you guys enjoyed that I will
catch you in my next video and to all
the mothers up there in the US and
Canada even here at home how about happy
Mother's Day we would appreciate you and
all that good stuff so catch you guys
