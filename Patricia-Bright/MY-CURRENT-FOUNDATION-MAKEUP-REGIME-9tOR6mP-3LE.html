upgraded makeup and beauty regime for
autumn and show you what colors and
stuff I'm incorporating into and get a
better look for autumn and just switch
it up a little bit because I've been
wearing the same kind of makeup look for
a while and I'm really really trying to
upgrade it so I just go ahead begin the
look so first of all I need some
eyebrows and the eyebrows are not
changing their kind of thick I'm loving
the scouts brow and I just use my pencil
to kind of fill them in so watch this if
you don't want that kind of boxy look
you really need to use a spoon me and
kind of just spread it out and then you
must conceal as well i conceal
so that's my brows done kind of you kind
of need to get the whole face in and i'm
just using like a mac and it's the
studio fix in an 8.5 and i really like
this one cuz i feel like it it really
kind of gives you that airbrushed look
so I always use a lighter concealer
about two shades lighter underneath my
eyes and that just gives me that bright
eye
that's my life foundation on my face
routine and then it's everything else
that I kind of upgrade and change for
the autumn so first things first I'm
probably not going to be wearing blue
liner anymore which has been my favorite
for but for all of sanitary and I'm
moving on to white eyeliner and just to
kind of give you more fresher piercing I
look
so the next wave upgrade in is by using
like bronzers now so not so much gold
and really really strong colors but
bronzes that kind of blend with my skin
this is called mulch and it's by Mac
and I'm definitely going for a lot
darker in the crease and i'm using
embark
you
then I use some mascara to kind of tie
that all in together and I'll probably
had some lashes for this video
so that's kind of my eyes and stuff done
and then I would kind of go on to add
some blush and I'd say I'm kind of
adding more a darker blush to my
collection so I've got this free piece
collection from sleek and I think this
is a nice dark blush which I think would
suit all complexions
but finally I'm just changing the kind
of lipsticks are where and I'm going for
a darker Barry look at the moment and
I'm using Mac's rebel which is a really
lovely Barry
it was at like a little peach or little
pain just on the inside give me a bit
more depth so guys that is my finished a
look it's really easy definitely kind of
the new colors you new things I'm
thinking about full autumn so thanks for
watching guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
