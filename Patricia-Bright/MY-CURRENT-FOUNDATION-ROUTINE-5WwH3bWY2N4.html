don't I'm sorry that I'm so raspy but
today's video is going to be a beauty
tutorial and accordingly kind of like
Victoria Secret bombshell transformation
and you guys may not under know this but
I find it really hard to do kind of like
you know quite sensual looks and I feel
that I've often I'm often mistaken for
being a lot younger than I am I know
I've got quite a baby face so I don't
really pass off these kind of sexy looks
very well but you know as older as I get
you know I want to try and embrace it a
little bit more and it kind of helps me
look a little older so I hope you
enjoyed this tutorial and it gives you a
few different ideas for that kind of
bombshell you especially if you're
trying to impress someone for I don't
know a special occasion or something
make sure you thumbs up if you do like
the videos like this I want to start
doing a bit more beauty makeup tutorials
and so do let me know your thoughts and
if you think I look kind of bad
okay so I'll see you guys later bye so
first of all I'm starting off with
priming my face I'm using crepin prime
by benefit which is absolutely amazing
it really gives me a flawless look
apology's as I know that it does look a
little out of focus but it should sort
itself out shortly I'm applying my
foundation which is from Mac and it's a
match masters in an 8.5 so it's a little
warmer than the one that I usually wear
so for that bombshell look I've realized
how eyebrows are so important and it's a
case of them being really quite defined
really quite full but having a nice arch
to them so I always use a dark pencil
and then conceive around them to give
them that really crisp look but when I
do this I ensure that I blend in a lot
as I've seen that look which just not
blended in enough so for that under-eye
glow again I use a concealer which is
two shades lighter than my skin and I do
it in a v-shape under my eyes and above
my cheek and it also helps from a slim
make my face look a little slip and
finally I'm just gonna set it off with
some powder which I really do so for the
eyes I just prime and I'm using Urban
Decay's primer and then I'm gonna use a
basic gold eyeshadow and I'm gonna just
Pat that onto my lid I then go for pink
which again is red for me but I thought
adds just a bit of a feminine touch to
it so till then bombshell that up I
added a kind of dark brown this is
embark by Mac and I just really roll
that into my crease and then even change
my brush to really get a more defined
shape finally I just highlight under my
brow so now I'm going to highlight and
contour and this is the sleek contour
kit which isn't a dark and I do it
around my nose
I am using a blending brush and I do
focus on doing it in quite stark on my
cheek start off quite heavy and then I
blend it in so then I highlight with a
highlight in place often with the
assistance of my husband and then I just
kind of blend that in and this is called
benefit high beam it's so amazing so to
finish off I add herbs my line are some
mascara and you cannot forget the dragon
lashes now I don't really like these but
these really do add to the bombshell
look and look great on a night out these
are by I'll or I'll put a link in the
description box of these go ahead and
add a nice pink blush for that bombshell
look and this is pink parfait from the
sleep kit and I'm adding a berry line
art as well I didn't touch which is a
great nude for dark skin basically and
with the plum was really great and then
just add some gloss to sex up my lips so
guys this is my finish bombshell makeup
look so let me know your thoughts and
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
