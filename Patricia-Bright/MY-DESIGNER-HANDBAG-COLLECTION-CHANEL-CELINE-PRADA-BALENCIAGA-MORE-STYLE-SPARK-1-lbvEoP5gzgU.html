out there and maybe I'll share as many
links and discounts as I possibly can

might have bag collection and give you
guys a little bit of how bad porn you
know we were like a little bit of that
don't we darlings and I wanted to share
with you my designer bag collection I
was a little bit expensive at it is very
expensive I'm going to show you the
prices how I bought them where I bought
them all that kind of things are
shelling so if you're not into you know
people may be spending more and designer
bags this is a collection I built over
years so please don't be judgmental
about someone has advice some people
like to travel some people like bags
some people like food some people like
um skydiving lots of people like
different things and I won't like that
bags are slightly my naughty vice so for
those of you who love this kind of video
get a pen and paper down because I've
got some tips as well for those of you
who might want to look at buying your
first designer bag and want to know how
to do it I'm also going to have a blog
post all about it over on my blog
Patricia Brice so I'm going to show you
my designer bag collection as well as
tips and tricks for looking after your
bags and also purchasing bags as well so
make sure you check that out and I hope
you enjoyed this video so the first bug
i wanted to share with you is the first
designer bag i ever bought and this is a
my Prada bag my first designer bag ever
as you can see it still looks absolutely
amazing there's two SIPP sections where
you can put things that are a little bit
more um you know private or delicate
into as well this bag is four years old
and I will say that this bag gets used
at least twice a week
for the last four year
that was a little bit more structured my
first got here but it's you know it's
kind of warmed up and stuff and I really
liked it I bought this bag for I think
it was about 1,000 pounds at the time
and these bags are a lot more expensive
now and I will tell you that this was a
lot of saving it was a lot of pondering
and it was around Christmas time but I
bought this for myself and I bought it
from Selfridges and I just love it it's
a badge that I wear with everything so
the next designer bag I purchased was my
Chanel and it's kind of a classic Chanel
I think it's almost a slightly limited
edition but obviously it has the classic
quilting and this has a gold chain and
the clasp is where you basically pull
the Chanel down and then it opens inside
it has a burgundy kind of color and I've
also got my authentication card is YP I
always keep the authentication cards for
my designer bag and this is the softer
leather so it's not that I think the
softer leathers called lambskin and EV
I'm not sure but this is the soft the
leather and so I'm very very careful
with this bad because it can scratch and
it doesn't come out a lot I bought this
bag duty-free when I was on my way to
New York if you get it duty-free you can
get 20% off and you guys know I love a
bargain and I always wanted this bag and
I think realistically I wanted the boy
bag but I wasn't sure that if the boy
bag was you know just a fashion piece it
was just a trendy one and also they
didn't have it so I went for this as a
great alternative and I'm so happy with
this as a purchase I actually ended up
getting a slight stain on the front of
it which was just the worst thing ever
but I took it to a place called the
handbag clinic where they basically
restored my bag they cleared up any
scuffs and literally got rid of the sign
on any signs of like discoloration or
anything so if you have designer bags
it's worthwhile maintaining them I will
link the handbag clinic below so you
guys can check them out but they were
amazing and really helped me get this
bag back this bag I think was about 1800
to 2 mm so again these are pricey bags I
am
grown woman though okay my second bag
off that is my Celine trapeze bag and it
is a tricolor one so you can see it's
got the bright blue the brown and the
black the leaves was really really
popular still really is popular
I think they stream like this style a
little bit more which I really like at
the moment and there was one that was
really really trendy that everyone had
and I was going to buy that bag and then
I you know tried it on in stores like
this bag is so heavy it was like heavy
empty how can the bag be heavy when it's
empty so I like that bag is not for me
and I picked up this one because I was
like I've got two black designer bags so
it's like well why not try something a
little bit new add a bit of color and
these colors definitely work for me and
I love it I don't wear this bag that
much I'm actually thinking that I might
sell this bag but um I don't know I
haven't quite decided yet so because
this is quite a unique shape I
definitely think it should be kept stuff
and not in the bottom of a drawer like
I've been keeping mine so after that I
picked myself a Balenciaga again another
brand that became quite trendy in 2014
2015 I mean obviously these brands have
been around for ages but I really like
bags that are really quite simple
I don't like bags with lots of like
branding and stuff over it's just not
really my thing and I seem to like a
really crisp and structured design the
bad so I like a love Victoria Beckham's
designer bags they were amazing I'll
probably get one and this one was just
so beautiful and so streamlined and I
love the color for spring I picked this
one up in matches fashion and I think I
was a discount on it I'm not sure I
think that actually might have been a
discount on it and as you can see it's
two-tone so it's got the silver and the
gold and then there's small Balenciaga
label here and then here is really
structured this is like a really nice
mechanism it's not loose like I wish you
could tell but look but then it's got a
silver and gold on there as well and it
also has these kind of I'm going to call
them feet because basically when you put
it down on the floor or something it
protects your bag from getting more
horrible and crusty and you
like that not that you'd be putting the
designer bags on the floor I love the
color of this I think this was 1300 when
I bought this I'll be honest it's really
not that big on the inside but I really
liked it because of how streamline it
was it has got a zips and a section but
I find that it just isn't very big and
it's shocked a structured bag like the
Nemours crazy hard stiff and strong on
this bag and it doesn't um scratch I was
very scared of its scratching but this
is a lovely one to ellic an all-black
outfit with and then like I have like
you know my pop of color and I love kind
of muted colors like this so after that
and I'm sure this is the bag that people
love and want to know about it is my
Chanel boy bag and I'm not gonna lie
this is like my favorite bag ever I love
love love love love this bag it's such
an amazing bag it was I used to think
that these bags are overrated but again
this is a bag that comes out two times a
week but literally it's so strong it
doesn't scratch it looks amazing with
everything it's an amazing size I think
this was an excellent purchase and
excellent purchase it's got the gunmetal
Hardware just like this and obviously
it's the classic quilted look but this
is the harder leather so I find that
this leather is very very good very very
sturdy and then it's Peyton around the
sides and edges so I just I just love
this bag I went with everything there
mechanism is the squeezing cast
mechanism as well to open it up and
that's what it looks like on the inside
men love the burgundy as well which I
find is just gorgeous so yeah that is
literally my favorite bag that bag was I
think it was it was over 2,000 pounds so
it is the most expensive bag in my
collection and I definitely think it was
worth it finally it's my color bag this
is the most recent bag that I purchased
and I absolutely love this one because
it's a much more affordable I mean when
I say affordable it's not too grand and
bad this was an 8
pound bad it is a small bag but I do
feel like Khloe has got more entry-level
price points when it comes to designer
bags that are very very beautiful and
it's kind of like a beautiful mink grey
color and then the top is suede and the
bottom is a leather I am really really
loving Khloe one because of the price
point but because the aesthetic is so
beautiful and loving a kite quite a
simple bag that's kind of what I'm light
but I just felt like this was something
I really needed in my collection so tips
for getting yourself a designer bag
number one set yourself a budget what is
the amount that you want to spend in a
year on designer bags I always do and
this is more like a financial management
kind of advice kind of bit if I'll be
honest with you but you should always
set aside your musts your wants and your
treats so say if you have to pay your
rent or you have to pay your mortgage we
have to pay your school fees don't eat
into all of that stuff to buy yourself a
bag no no no no no and then I have one
so things that are going to help you in
the future so putting about 20 percent
of your earnings aside for more like
investments and things that you're going
to do in the future and then you can
have a little bucket for treats so what
I have is like a treat bucket for money
where I'm like okay well this is how
much I've got that I can spend on the
goodies that I like never ever spend on
a designer bag that you can't afford or
that you don't have the budget for or
that you have not saved before
definitely don't do that don't go broke
to wear YSL it's not that deep okay my
second tip is don't buy the bag straight
away
think about it ponder on it look on it
there are so many websites that are
amazing for you to research on also
there are other youtubers who have
designer bags to showing you their pros
and cons about the bags and so just
check those out before you make your
decision number three if you can get
your bag on a discount so say at an
airport if you know you're traveling at
some point in time you can get it
duty-free or if you know there's going
to be some form of discount on in-store
so during that Friday I think
this collie bag wasn't on sale but other
ones had 20% off as well Givenchy had
20% off as well so don't try and not buy
a bag at a premium time try and buy if
there's an offer or discount on number 4
try and buy a bag that you know is going
to suit your style don't pick something
that is super trendy that you're not
going to be able to wear again and
you're gonna hate pick color palettes
that are more suitable to your wardrobe
so if you've got a crazy wardrobe and
you love bright colors and reds and
purples and all that kind of stuff then
buy it but if you're someone who's a
much more neutral definitely go for the
blacks first and then for the muted
colors and then buy yourself a bag with
a pop once you've got you know a bass
collection number 5 make sure you can
keep everything that you got with the
bag so that is like all the boxing or
the authentication card all the duffel
bags everything that you can keep to
store it in I have most of the boxes and
most of the duffel bags keep those
because if you ever want to maybe make
some money or resale or exchange your
bag then people really add much more
value to keeping those authentication
cards and they love it number 6 is you
don't actually have to buy a new
designer bag there's so many sites out
now where people who've got pre love
designer bags if you don't make the big
splash and spend 2 grand
well why not spend 600 and see what you
think about it I'll link some of the
sites that I know that are around like
kind of like depop but they're like
designer handbag exchange sites so for
instance I'm thinking about selling one
of my Chanel bags not my boy one the
other one and potentially my silene I
would put it on that site which I know
is where people are looking for designer
bags to buy so guys that is the end of
my handbag collection I hope you found
it a little bit helpful even if you just
wanted to be nosy into what I had and
that is a style spot for you so if
there's anything else style wise that
you want me to talk about please let me
know in the comments if you like videos
like this I will keep doing them but you
know it's the new year new me so why not
you know try and make a little bit of
extra effort so guys thank you so much
for watching and I will catch you later
