hello people welcome to my channel today
is the day that I do the number one room
tour and my makeup storage and
collection video which I think
everything for one eye contact and I was
gonna do but today is the day I'm gonna
do it and for those of you who don't
know
I moved house about two months there are
two or three months ago now and
basically I converted the spare bedroom
into like the room that you see like my
closet my makeup my storage why film
when I work from and it was just nice to
be able to convert a space in my home I
could use as my own for a hundred
percent privilege a hundred percent
lucky to be able to do that and I wanted
just to show you what I had in here you
guys have been seeing my epic black and
white form which is that little world I
will show you guys I'm going to show you
how I did it but I might just use a
before and after and so you can see what
I had down but I don't know how I'm
actually going to positioning video I'm
just going to talk and we're just gonna
roll and go through this okay okay okay
so the first thing you'll notice as you
come into my room is the black and white
flooring it's really unique I was 100%
inspired and basically I got black
flooring and white flooring both from
quickstep and I basically did them
alternating and I basically got a floor
fitter to do it for me guy dinelli he
definitely gave me a side I when I
showed him that I wanted this but I
fitted it and he said you know what it
looks alright after that you will see my
print wall every single print that have
you see is from decennial because they
do the best prints literally of all time
they're super affordable this is a
fashionable stylist but I really like
their prints and but yeah I really love
the kind of green and the pink and of
course like the feature lady who I
thought like she looked like she was
going for
girl I've got up code for 25% off and
the code is bright 25 they ship all over
the world USA Canada Australia and the
EU and honestly right they're the best
prints I've ever had after that I have
just this really nice bench which I
picked up from Quique map and it's not
dirty or anything it's just that it's
got a hint of pink in it so it has this
kind of look I really like this because
my room is themed black white or the
head pink and gold of course
so the lovely cow print and it just
feels nice it's nice to sit on and yes
love it after that got my light which is
from next I believe this is my old house
and I fit for it fits perfectly here my
closet are from Ikea I think my other
pets wardrobe but they work in when I
got here so I think they have them
fitted in but the only thing I want to
change is their handles I really don't
like these long handles and I've were
going to spray pants and and bronze or
do something to just spruce them up a
little bit after that I have my life
unit which is why people my house wear
underwear sportswear all that kind of
stuff on top of it I have more prints
from do videos as well as a couple of
trinkets which are from next and Tesco
and a bunch of other places on the other
side you'll see that I have this little
round marble table another amazing fine
from TK Maxx and for like a marble table
this cost 69 pounds and this is why TK
Maxx is actually born after that I have
my mirror this is not what I thought it
was going to be I picked it up some
Amazon you know I ABS a little bit of
extra to the room and at least it lights
up so over on this side this is where I
would call my makeup corner I'm going to
take you through that now okay we're
over here in the house of the maker of
makeup pencil relatives I'm about having
a huge huge huge makeup collect
and just because I really got one face
and I love makeup and of course I do
makeup but open fashion and lifestyle
other stuff and I can straight up makeup
person and also I'm not a makeup artist
I don't need a crazy selection or makeup
or whatever but I basically have this
wonderful set of drawers from Ikea and
then this section here funny enough I
found that with me the majority of the
stuff I have is like skin care because
they love of my skin care I'm going to
show you exactly what I have and where I
got it from and just show you how I
organize it so the first thing I have is
this lipstick holder which you just got
just under pretty lipstick my retro map
and Stasia these really nice lip glosses
that I really like from bareMinerals
monkey or lipsticks these are lit fits
that looks really nice and some of them
are got some really nice favor from them
as well I picked up this lipstick holder
from Amazon it's really good but if I
swing it to you from sometimes the
lipsticks insider it's like off which is
amazing remember that is clean makeup
story shape I think it was an animal in
well and I basically put whether scara's
eyeliners and pigments and well and
pretending like I actually use pigments
regularly I really do and I just did it
here's a demonstration for you guys but
after that I've got the palette holders
which are actually let to hold it I
realize that they look really really
good for my palettes and stuff
especially pilots I'd love at the moment
this a war apart from an insomnia it's
just insane like it's in the same
spectral other Olympian sea with my
special giving full and afterlife love
it and in my process my Mac room neutral
color
just a few others as well a more people
a they're over there and it's also at
least I'm here which I put all my
eyelashes in so the law might all
I'm not them as much as I used
to I come in lark backstage in a shape
they're really affordable and they fit
into me but another convinced them to me
or what's up I just get a bunch of them
and I want to see like shot the mountain
original ashes and then our girl
Chanel and throwing is these lectures
are quite dramatic but they're cute is
one it was special creation and mobin
and my favorite I want to see fails back
these beauties but when I was being
ingenious I decided that I will store my
eyelashes in a pillbox I don't know
where I saw this and joy that is from
someone or somewhere on the Internet
this is a great way to store lashes but
if you are afraid of finding my shears
like on the bottom of Norfolk or like
scrunched up somewhere you're going to
get yourself a pure box for the back
sorry in my lashes you know I'm not
going away they're not good
yeah this is what I do you work so so
well and then I have these cups
I bought these on nets and gold or three
months of model session yeah these are
really nice they're nice and tall great
my lashes after that I have this gold
box kit here which quite heavy
this is right for like the new you so
when I get used up in and I want to like
automatically or trying out off-putting
so really come be invisible to see a lot

that water blend
furthermore the liquidy blend of a blush

the music paste or L'Oreal the colors
are valium like when they come out I
will
actually there at you feel good and then
I looked at my beauty Brock and get a
monthly beauty box from the fantastic
every month and look like that's it and
that's what I've landed my booty box and
hurry but it is about ten pounds and
like the dark spots of the natural
beauty box that I got really good
products in there really introduced me
to me brand and what I hadn't really
been aware all right laura geller
but really big open I just put that
stuff there just to remind me like to
try it but come a little bit closer
I'm so glad myself but my something like
this at listen it wasn't like this
before
trust me but I basically have these is
that these are from Ikea I think that's
like jewelry storage and stuff but I use

beautiful Burberry oh my gosh

contradiction connection because they're
all good like I feel like they're all
good element but so one
welcome to white and is my last one Tim
I know this is actually a more
moisturizing formulation but normally I
like to use the matte formulation they'd
probably be a bit girly and Giulio use
this one and of course we have trim apt

never used to use this but I ended up
picking up in mean when I went on
holiday look about four o'clock super
information with me caught it in the

matte complete concealers although they
certainly like the darker one but this
colors dark coffee I use it look at that

you guys might not be familiar in a
massacre but they do have really good
dark foundation in chocolate foundation

these from this is actually from the
anselm astrologist who specializes in

insane and there's a also like sunscreen
feels she for everything and like she's
got like a full set septic system which
I've been doing for a whole almost the
whole month and I can honestly say that
I can see that my skin without makeup
it's a lot more even like if it's crazy
she's amazing
and then I thought ela mix of these
other products are amazing I love their
Daisy like facial moisturizer it's
really nice but moisturizing at the same
time I've had patients there I took my
mom for face regimen is amazing I'm
excited because I'm going to sit down

accepted it fit in my palate section and

stuff and then this drawer that's is
empty because of obviously artisans are
