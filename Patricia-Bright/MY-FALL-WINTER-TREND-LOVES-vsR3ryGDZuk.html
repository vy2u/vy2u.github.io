basically getting into like winter
ultimi wintry it's getting cold and
quite horrible here sadly we get rain
like then we get constant rain I thought
I would talk about trends so like autumn
wintry trends and I'm not a trend person
and I don't think like you should follow
fashion or stuff like that but there's
some really cool bits that I really do
like company that are trends and I
thought I'll show you about how I wear
it and if you hold out to the end I have
a little treat for you as well
first trend is definitely boots like
really high boots or even over the knee
boots I didn't quite like over the knee
boots for me because I've got really
skinny ankles and the ones that over the
knee boots just look really saggy and
horrible me
so I got some really nice highly boot
high boots and knee-high boots is it
high knee or nehi nehi high knee and I
absolutely loved them I find them really
flattering you can wear them with jeans
skinny leggings and even skirt and
they're a great way to keep your legs
warm like during the winter and they're
kind of expensive I found but they will
last you for years
number two trend is played and I was
like mom played and I remember seeing
quite a lot of it there's loads of
played right now in the shops but I
don't usually like the kind of the green
and the red played but I found this
skirt which is a black and white played
and I absolutely love it can wear it
with like basics and simple things
really really cool guys it's definitely
something you can wear all year round as
well so this was a really weird on but I
love it because I'm a girly girl and
that is pastels I was really surprised
that pastels were like kind of a trend
and I still saw a couple of bits of
pastels even in the winter especially
that very
pink baby blues and and baby greens I
don't know if that's what it's actually
officially called but I absolutely love
this trick because I'm such a girly girl
and you know maybe you won't wear it
every day while you're charging along in
the mud but you might wear it on an
evening hour or out to dinner and for
really cool in it
finally it's furry things I love Furby
things I have got fur jackets I have got
well not real fur guys I've got fur
jackets and virtual AIDS but there was
this alternative fur trend then I
absolutely love this alternative third
train so like I found this really cool
bag from a source that was furry and I
was like oh my gosh this is so cool but
I love it like fur for me it's just
something I love to it during the cold
times because it's always so cozy and
snuggly and makes you feel so I don't
know if you guys were like that I feel
like that so guys what I would just eat
to decided to do is I'm going to give
away something that is in this video all
you need to do is actually just like the
video give it a little thumbs up and
leave a comment below on what item you
like and please don't all go for the
boots because they were here expensive
but you know I'm freaking out right now
so we'll see what we get there and there
