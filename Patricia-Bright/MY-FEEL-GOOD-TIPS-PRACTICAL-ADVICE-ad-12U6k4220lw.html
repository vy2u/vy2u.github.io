of my feel good tips to be the best me
and we all have those days when we wake
up and they just feel right just argh
and just not the best so I'm gonna share
what I like to do just to kind of get me
out of that mood
the first thing I like to do is to get
fresh and that's basically just to be
fly looking first thing I like to do is
to brush my teeth and get them nice and
white and I'm using the Colgate expert
white which is great for whitening your
teeth and I feel like a white team gives
you a great smile which gives you great
confidence after that I like to go in
with a face mask and the good thing
about face masks is that they feel like
you are treating yourself but I always
like to go for a mug master but it's
totally clarifying and it kind of goes
that I've just drawn all the impurities
out of my skin doing my hair and makeup
always also makes a difference and
obviously if my faith is nice and clear
putting on my makeup and putting a nice
outfit
will make me feel a lot more confident
in myself and I don't know if you guys
have those times that you just don't
feel like making an effort trust me so
love the time and I'm in a bad mood it's
probably because I haven't done the
things I need to do like work or
housework something like that and what I
like to do to feel better is just to
finally just be productive and I have
this kind of rule of 1 as at least if I
could try and get one thing on my list
done I'll feel better but often that
will motivate me to do a lot more things
but getting on with things that are like
a burden are super important to just
feeling your best
so we all know that getting active and
exercising is gonna make you feel good
be it walking in the park or going to
the gym sometimes I don't even want to
do that so I like to just go out to my
garden and do a couple of stretches and
just do some light exercise but anything
that's gonna get my body moving it's
gonna make me feel good and usually once
I start I kind of get bored away into it
and then that feeling ten times better
afterwards
so the 3s food family and friends and
this is something that I love to do I
like to get my friends together get
barbecue on there's nothing that's gonna
make me feel better than the people I
have around me and if you are often
feeling bad just surround yourself with
positive people whether or not you hold
a party or you got for dinner you go to
the pub just doing something like that
is gonna generally make you feel a lot
better guys those are a few of my tips
that I like to do to feel like the very
best me hopefully it gives you a little
bit integration and makes a little bit
more positive if you're having I'm not
so amazing day so guys thank you for
watching and I'll catch you guys later
