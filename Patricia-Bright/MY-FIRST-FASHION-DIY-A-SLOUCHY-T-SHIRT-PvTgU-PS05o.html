a little bit different it's going to be
a tutorial and I'm going to upcycle a
really easy item for those of you who
have like me who are kind of creative
but aren't that good with our hands or
sewing machines there's definitely quick
and easy way to upcycle bits and bobs
and you guys know I love same bits and
bobs though you but today I'm going to
upcycle literally a piece of fabric and
I love this fabric I found it for like I
think it's a cut off and from another
roll of fabric you guys could do this
out of anything right your mom's net
curtains or your mom's tablecloth just
keep stealing some if your mum's stuff
to do this without her knowing but it's
so easy to do and it takes less than two
minutes to do it so i'll show you how it
works so all you need to do is get all
your items handy and all you'll need is
a piece of fabric probably about two
meters by two meters some scissors a
measuring tape I didn't have measuring
tape so I'm just going to use this for
now and just add anything else that you
think the necessity so what you're going
to want to do is get yourself in front
of a mirror fold your fabric in half and
put this against yourself to kind of
work out how sure or how long you want
your top to be once you're kind of clear
on that you can keep it folded in half
and lay it on a flat surface like the
floor once you're ready and you remember
what length you want it then you can go
ahead and start cutting really easy
so to get the neck in what you want to
do is measure the width of your fabric
for mine here 20 is about central and
i'm going to count four inches one way
and i'm going to cut there and then i'm
going to count four inches the other way
so I'm going to start cutting a
semicircle around the front piece of
fabric and I can cut the other side as
well a bit higher to create a neckline
opened it flat out and if there are any
jaggedy bit I can just smooth those out
so next time just folded it back and
gonna start cutting and it's kind of
going to look like a t-shirt for a
really big person and that means that
you've got the right shape
do then going to want to turn your t
shirt inside out and begin sewing and
I'm terrible at sewing so anyone can do
this if you like you can enlist the help
of a team to speed the process along and
then you're going to turn it back inside
out and voila you are done this is the
end of the tutorial super quick and easy
to do make sure you try at home thanks
for watching guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
