about
hello beautiful people welcome to my
channel I hope you are doing well I'm
excited as I always am because I'm about
to do a first today sweeties I'm about
to do first I am about to try out for my
first time ever Kylie cosmetics so
before we get into this video subscribe
if you're not already subscribe join the
family if you want a minute if you want
to feel like you're part of something
partake welcome come in you are welcome
because I know some people decide if
they like a person or not based on how
emotionally connected they feel they are
to the Kardashian so it's subscribe
before we get into this okay today is my
first time trying Kylie cosmetics and
obviously she has just launched a new
concealer I know some people are
thinking it's just colour-pop cosmetics
or the kinda label on I am going to
hopefully at some point try it out
however I do live in England so imma be
waiting here for a good three to four
weeks before it actually comes through
to me however I hadn't been a Kylie
cosmetic purchased up ever before
whatsoever so what I decided to do is to
Spencer point okay because my tick I'll
be honest I'm not a huge Kylie fan or
Kylie cosmetics fan
I haven't used the products before
besides when the k'kaw beauty was
released but I hadn't bought anything
for Kylie cosmetics and when it first
came out I remember there being quite a
lot of drama around it you know the
lipsticks with low-quality
sometimes when the Kardashians sometimes
release products often looks like their
name is just on it and they just don't
care about it and so that was what I
think my mindset was - Kylie cosmetics
was prior however what I have seen is
that there has been quite a lot of
developments right there's new rains
coming out it's been consistent she
seems on it and I've seen people
physically wearing the product so when
I've been out and about and I've got two
events and I see a go and I'm like oh
your lips look nice what you wear and
then I thought it's Kylie and is this
iMac okay but some of you guys are
really really liking it that has kind of
been warping my mind and making me think
you know I'm gonna give it a go
give it or go as I said okay I will
spend some coin and I did this about
four weeks ago before I even heard about
the launch of the new concealers and I
bought some stuff from Kylie cosmetics
this is my bucks from Kylie cosmetics
it's actually smaller than I thought it
would be I ended up spending I think I
spent a hundred and $26 on the products
I don't think I have too expensive I
don't think they're too cheap or
anything I definitely found them to be
quite a middle-of-the-road in terms of
price so I spend a hundred twenty six
dollars and I would say for those of you
who are all doing to Europe or to
England be a whether you might get
slapped with some kind of fee or fine or
charge and as you guys can see right
here right as you guys might see right
here is that it said customs fee to pay
I had to pay twenty seven pounds 93
pence in charges and if you really
sickly think about that twenty seven
pounds is about 40 US dollars which it
could have basically got me at two
lipsticks and a half from Kylie
cosmetics so then that's something that
is really worthwhile noting right
receiving that items is actually
expensive if you live in England but you
know we're just going to let that slide
because you know it's my first time so
here we go here we go give my order so I
bought some velvet lipsticks I bought
glosses i bought a highlighter and i
bought a car I know I've got to say the
inside does look it does look bangin I
think it's really cool I do think that
the decoration and everything and the
way that they spoil it and the Brandon
is on a plane know like okay so let's
get inside I've got the eyeshadow and I
think I do fit in the packaging that's
absolutely amazing and okay okay I
bought this purple palette why I bought
purple color I don't know it because I
don't really like purple I think I went
for purple to see if it will pop on me
but now that my hair is red I don't
think it's actually gonna work well
we'll see if we can make it worse so
next up I bought a highlighter and just
swatch that again it's got that drippy
design which I think looks super super
cool like well done for them and then
I've also got nifflas as of
again I tried to pick favorites that
were from that the everyday collection
that these are lipsticks and lipglosses
as well but do you know what I can show
you everything but the proof is in the
pudding when you apply product and see
what it looks like okay let's get
started so I'm gonna go in with the
pressed powder eyeshadows I love the
fact that it's got the names on the back
it's got all the names on the back and
I'm not gonna lie
somehow the shades are looking a little
bit as tastic little as tastic so first
thing let's do a lil swatch test so this
shade here is called stone okay that
looks kind of its kind of got purple
reflection lot going on on it it isn't
actually it's quite cute next up we have
this bronzy color which is called trophy
and I like this I thought my can't be
getting a bit more pigment not really
doing that much
okay this shade here is called a
periwinkle which looks like a kind of
grey and that is chalk ash I don't know
who that's gonna look good on who did
who's that meant to look good on come on
then there's this shade here called
turning violet that's such a cute name
another color that looks chalk esque
and almost applies like chalk oh this
shade here in the middle beautiful I
don't know why they're praying so just
basic right now I think I've got
moisturizer on my hand so it's not
spreading very well and then this shade
here is called lilac you can see what
that looks like there's this iridescent
shade here old blueberry shade I love
that shade it's called purple smoke dark
color called a Miss this shades I'm
gonna light some of the shades are
looking a little bit chalk tastic like
actually quite a few of them at least
50% are quite chalk casting but I do
think my hands are a little bit oily so
I think the best thing to do is just
create a new look and see what I think
it looks good and I'll be honest I'm not
someone who wears lots of purples and
stuff so hmm
I should have gone for maybe like a warm
neutral palette but let's make this work
the only thing is that I can't really
see a transition shade or a brown or
something in here that's gonna work if
you're someone who wears purple
eyes let me know some of them glittery
shade they look like they're gonna be
really nice okay we're already starting
off to a bad start I'm gonna go over my
math my Mac palette just to create a
nice little some warmth of transition
because this is what I need you guys
know I always need to have like a little
bit of orange little bit of brown just
to create some war on my eye because if
not I just think I look weird I'll radio
okay so I'm going to go in with a shade
called my look okay it's coming through
no it showed up initially when I put it
on it looked quite blue okay it blends
quite nicely it's looking very muddy
that has gone really muddy why has it
done that that has got my color
muddy smoky Brown that's awful I mean it
looks super smoky my plan wasn't to go
super smoky I think there's a lot of
pigment in there but that doesn't look
on camera or in life like a purple on me
at all let me try and put it on like
under my eyes and see what difference in
me do you know it goes on quite purple
and then it just goes grey but look at
the shade on the brush and then look at
the shade on my eye even down there
where I didn't put any Brown look at
that mmm okay okay I think it looks very
muddy when I think of a purple like I
look I feel like it should look really
bright and really vibrant this looks
like a grey and there's a lot of Gray's
in the palette so maybe that's a thing
this is where one where I might actually
just hit the baby right and just start
again I do it again and it all ends up
looking the same that's let's talk let's
start again that might have been because
I use the brown beforehand so let us
just you know let's just go again okay
round two let's rock this I still like
the purple under my eyes just because
we're here now okay okay how are we
gonna do this well I'm gonna go in with
this middle shade called wine and dine
and I'm just gonna go over a little bit
and I'm just gonna create a transition
okay wine and dine I mean maybe it went
wrong because I was trying to make or
maybe it's because you know this doesn't
really mix very well with other shadows
I've never heard of any eye shadow you
know not being able to mix and loads of
us a layer I shadow is you know again
this is meant to be a purple it looks
had muddy gray as in the purple that was
there has gone right this is what the
purple look like on the brush that's
what the purple looks like on the brush
but why does it really look like it's
gray on my eyes like that's insane
that is literally insane definitely
looks better than would it look like
when I just applied it before okay let's
sit let's make this a look I'm just
gonna cut out my lid using matte cast is
a cream-colored base which is really
nice just to create a color to go ahead
and put something on top off next I'm
gonna go in with this shade called
trophy and go in on my lid and it picks
up so nicely on the brush and or unlike
the way that sit in a way need this also
looks like one of those shades that will
look really nice or even look nice up
when you apply it with your fingers
definitely giving me who the beauty
vibes as a lip color that looks so
pretty
but that purple that wine and dine looks
so muddy
honestly just I just don't know what I
can do about this it bad she looks mad
muddy then you know that great on top of
it just looks even worse
I think it's so ugly like the knit
colors gorgeous I'm going to go in with
this shade here it is called I believe
it's called Newberry
which looks really nice like this could
like lift it out our blueberries coming
through yes blueberry okay blueberry is
a shade I do not know what was going on
with those like mats they look awful
I just tried to make this work put
little lashes and a little mascara and I
still think it looks like just looks
like dots I hate everything about it I
think it's a really
you guys know I'm a makeup enthusiast I
like makeup I do know how to apply
makeup to myself not an expert bar I
found that very very very difficult to
work with
and I felt like the shades in there were
not good for making a whole eyelid
there's no Browns or warm shades and
obviously this is a palette that wasn't
for me and obviously it's a purple that
could be my fault for my choice but I
found that their mats went muddy they
look so muddy they look really pigmented
I might purple on the brush but
realistically when I put them on it like
I just rubbed you know did you or my
eyes I was just confused why I've Nick
on this brown gray what's going on
however like this the shade on my lid is
nice but actually it is a bit sparkly
and as you can see it's kind of gone
everywhere this looks very amateur like
it just looks really amateur and I think
if you are a newbie to makeup I don't
know how you're gonna make something
like this way yeah this is giving me
subculture vibes definitely yes so for
me this is a no let me just take this
off because I feel really off-key like
sitting here 24 to purple panda eyes are
gone and back hello
go ahead I'm gonna try it the chi-lites
huh this shade is called purple caramel
I've caramel salted caramel that's what
it's called sorry illuminating powder
I should swatch okay it's kind of like
this champagne ego I like the
consistency it's really creamy I'm gonna
use this L'Oreal kabuki brush to just
spread it's really nice oh okay it's
cooler than I normally go for so it's
like all of my hair back it's cooler
than I normally go for but it's not bad
it's not bad at all it's really soft
it's really finely milled oh oh so nice
highlight it's nice the girl is really
nice here it's really finely milled I
mean it's nothing to really really write
home about like you know there's some
highlight is that you write home about
it's almost quite like a little tinge of
green to it I'm seeing at just a little
one and the trophy wife also has that
kind of slight green tinge to it but
overall it's really nice it there's no
good or in it which i think is really
nice it's really smooth on the skin and
I don't think it will enhance like it
doesn't make my pores look any worse
almost give any more age and I actually
think it looks kind of cute I mean it's
nothing to write home about but I think
it's a lot better than that I touch upon
it a lot of that are doing it's really
nice it's quite subtle but this side
I've put loads on and I feel like you
can like build it up I don't hate that I
think it actually looks very nice okay
well you girl is coming together right
next up we had one of these lipsticks
gone I've got to say the packaging for
these are so nice gloss is okay we've
got two glosses here you've got pop in
and we've got naughty let's go ahead and
try these okay you've got a little bit
of flailing going on here this is giving
me Oh what's going on with the brush
what is going on with the brush what the
hell is getting progressively worse as I
put it in there why is it doing that
what is going on why is it doing that
why is it can you see that can you see
it's like all played out it wasn't like
that before maybe the things to hold I'm
small for okay let's just go but that's
very annoying for application
mm this has given me 90s ruinous but in
a modern way I don't hate that I think
it looks quite nice
I think you've nicely lined lips as well
it would look good look nice
inside the lips it looks a bit chunky
that makes any sense not bad though I
quite like that I just can't see me
wearing it I think it might be nice as a
lip topper okay this shade is called
naughty
hello naughty wow that is a beautiful
Wow that is gorgeous
it's so pigmented it just looks like a
shiny cherry drop have you look at my
bottom lip look how red this looks this
is what you need in a gloss oh my gosh
and this applicator isn't doing that
craziness as well no like that is the
most gorgeous red gloss I think I have
ever seen
I'm astounding it I'm actually astounded
because I've never seen a red gloss like
this this is honestly my kind of red
across these lips that like come get me
bitch
come get me gosh these are very pinup
red lips but I cannot believe the
quality I cannot believe how pigmented
it is how flawlessly that applied
especially in comparison to our party
everything else has been so for me
this is look at this fantastic now I
wish I picked up some more Gossage
because this is amazing this has got
such good color payoff and I'm gonna
take it off I love it
next up I'm gonna go in with this shade
called birthday suit I've heard a lot
about this shade it's like a nudey shade
but we know what it's like when they say
nudie if you are my skin tone so let's
go in with this shade
really winning oh my god oh my god
seriously you're gonna take me if I just
sit here and talk to you like this
so this is a key example of although
something might look nice in advertising
on market it looks great on her but by
the time you put it on you look like a
tome right you actually look insane you
look I literally look like I have been I
don't know like I've not heard of
chapstick I have some kind of disorder I
wears on the sight it looks phenomenal
and it actually looked like it was
slightly darker right now my lips look
like they have been dipped in acid like
there's something wrong they look so
ridiculous I don't know if a lip liner
could even save this what I will say
I've been talking I'm just seeing this
gray hole moving my face it looks so
stupid but I will say that as a liquid
lipstick it feels really nice on I look
like a hot hot hot mess and look like
though you know those cut those racist
cartoon characters will have the black
face and the big lips this is what I
look like
no these shades that they say nude or
like naked or birthday suit for like a
woman of color they never are they
actually just make us look unwell that's
what's necessary like browns and news
that actually work for those with darker
skin because these news they like who
next up is a shade called Punk which
looks like a nice dark move which should
it look ashy on me let's roll
I love that I'm really getting into
darker lips at the moment Wow it goes in
my hair as well only thing I don't know
it's a bit weird though
I need something slightly lighter on the
inside actually I'm gonna go in with
birthday soon and just give me a little
bit of an ombre lip that's what I'm
talking about not gonna lie I think
that's really nice then that's really
nice I really like the shade I think it
goes really well with my hair and it
looks kind of sophisticated overall what
I feel like we can say and what I think
we might all say about Kylie cosmetics
is that the lip products are poppin like
they're really good finally if the shade
doesn't suit you but the quality of them
is really nice it feels really nice on
my lip reading that not drying like some
of my other liquid lipsticks and stuff
that I just had a palette that was dead
that would have really stopped me from
buying another eyeshadow palette from
there to be honest with you because I
just thought it looked like a muddy run
mess honestly the highlighter was nice
that and as you can see it looks really
nice on my face right now it's not much
to write home about but it's nice so
with the lipsticks I've been there
poppin I think they're really really
nice it's makes me excited to try the
satin lipsticks the concealer I mean
maybe I might make the order we'll see
but I would definitely buy one if he's
on there but actually given the fact
that I got charged 27 pounds and that
could buy me a good two lipsticks from
somewhere else I probably wouldn't order
it from here in the UK or in Europe but
if I was in the States and visiting yes
I definitely would okay guys that is my
first impression of Kylie cosmetics what
do you think your kind of cosmetics fan
