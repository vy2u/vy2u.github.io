everyday makeup and this is basically
the makeup look I have been wearing so
much it's a lot more natural then I've
been wearing in the past and it's all
about kind of being highlighted and
contoured and Julie in a way that
doesn't look kind of scary and I feel
like 2015 makeup looked very scary and
quite overdone but it's at 2016 is the
year of the demure but sexy it's like an
enhanced version of yourself and I am a
little bit more chubby than normal some
of you guys might not notice here some
people said they look cinema it's
probably just my makeup game has it so
which does like me but I just wanted to
share and show you guys what I've been
absolutely loving to do you don't have
to use the products that I use I have
some recommendations I actually used a
new contour and highlight that I've
never used before and I love the results
and you can use anything that works for
you so that's basically it it's probably
gonna be a chatty video so I hope you
enjoy it and I'll catch you later
bye alright so I'm gonna do my brows
first and I'm using the Anastasia the
dip brow pomade in the chocolate
everyone was telling me that I shall
definitely use this one instead because
I was using I think it was evany and I
found it to be like to grade but this
one's a lot warmer and it suits me so
obviously they look a bit crazy on my
face without having concealer around
them and I used to always go for
concealer that was maybe like a couple
of shades lighter but nowadays I'm not
really liking that kind of halo effect
around my eyebrows so I said I'm just
gonna use my normal Foundation which or
I could use a concealer that's not as
dark but I'll just go for using my
normal foundation around my brows to
give them a shape and so by using the
right color you avoid that kind of halo
look which was quite trendy last year
but I think we're like moving away from
that and I kind of like a more natural
eyebrow
I usually just go ahead with my fingers
to basically just blend that in but
obviously once the rest of the makeup
and face is done it looks a lot better
go ahead or with a spoolie just to brush
out the end so they don't look so harsh
I'll be honest with you my eyebrows are
the thing that take the longest on my
face
literally they take forever all right
eye brows are done so I'm gonna go ahead
with the concealer which really makes a
difference when it comes to my
highlighting and contouring I'm going to
use the bare minerals of bare skin
coverage concealer the color I'm using
is dark today a recommendation for
something a little bit more affordable
is the LA girl Pro concealer as well I
use the color 4 but this is a new one so
I just wanted to try it and I usually
just do a kind of v-shape I take it
under my nose based on the shape of my
face I don't do is I don't take it too
wide because that will widen a fatter
face basically so make it long but don't
make it wide oh my gosh that sounds look
I like it long oops this is what all
adults here actually know how or do you
guys know something you guys a bit too
young hopefully too young to get that
kind of joke I just made there this
feels very nice and very creamy and then
I am going to go ahead and draw a line
down the middle of my face to highlight
my nose a little bit and I used to
highlight my forehead I looked at my
forehead I was like you know what my
forehead is already wide it doesn't need
any more highlighting to go towards it
so I stopped that and I said this in my
last makeup video that you'll have to do
everything that everyone else does just
because they're doing it and the worst
thing is when you get the line then it
just gives you a bent face and then also
you can go ahead and do this here you
just bring some sliminess in and cause
the cheeks to pop a little bit more and
I did get on the bandwagon and I do have
the artiste brushes I'm going to say
that I really do like the way they apply
they are very soft and I really thought
that they wouldn't be that soft but they
are supersonically so
they give you a really nice dense
application my only thing is I feel like
you'll end up using more products or
wiping off a lot of product when you use
a brush like this because it's so dense
it picks up so much product but it gives
you a really nice airbrushed finish and
this concealer this is the first time
I've used this concealer by the way it
is blending in like a dreamboat
and for my nose I just use my finger
excellent so I'll it kind of creepy
right now I'm sure that we're gonna make
this all work so the foundation I'm
using is the new formulation for wire so
the two she cloth which is a beautiful
beautiful foundation I love the color
it's so warm it's so rich I feel like it
really does suit my skin tone and
there's also the brush which goes
beautifully but it looks really rich but
this is perfect for me at the moment
during the winter I like to add just a
little bit of color to myself anyway so
that I know I look rich so looks you
know sunkissed the brush is a very dense
and compact brush but it's also very
soft
I'm gonna go ahead and use my fingers
just to blend everything in a little bit
better and right now I am totally all
about the jus another makeup to look
really really kind of wet almost and I
feel like a more Juve look it's such a
supermodel look I feel like models
always look like they've got really
moist skin now my brows are not looking
on fleek because they haven't been done
recently so I'm just going to welcome
them a little bit gonna add a bit of
brow gel just to tame them so if you can
try and keep your eye brows maintained
and I will add a touch of lighter
concealer just so it's a little bit of
brightness going to it you know so that
is basically me highlighted in my
version of highlight I like to keep it a
little bit more natural a little bit
more softer and I'm gonna go ahead and
I'm going to use the Anastasia cream
contour kit in the deep this is new I
haven't used it before I brought it on
cult the UT I've always preferred to use
creams or foundations to contour over
powders and it does like this one's a
little bit cooler so I'm gonna go for
the warmer one and I might using my
finger because I feel like I could feel
my bridge and I can feel like word best
to contour so everybody contours their
nose differently but I find that I need
to bring it in more and also not to do
it like all the way down there because
that makes my nose looks look wider
basically and then I have this amazing
brush from Estee Lauder it is the
sculpting foundation brush - and
actually it reminds me of the it took on
Buki brush from NARS
but this brush is better it's kind of
got a angle or curved angle I don't know
if you can see that it's got a really
curved angle and it is great for like
getting the contour shape you can
basically create the perfect curve with
this and the line is very very shot and
so I just create like a sea here and
blend it out and then I also get just
under my chin as well now obviously have
a hairy face maybe a little harsher just
so you guys can see it on camera laughs
what you'll see is that just gives me a
little bit more definition like I was
really nice and I'm just going to use a
light fluffy brush just to give me a bit
more airbrushed look I'm gonna go ahead
and do my eyes and stuff I'm using a
sleek palette I hope you sleep in ages
but they've got these new pilots over it
you know what I'm gonna try it you know
you something a bit more affordable
sometimes and they were one of my first
favorite brands ever if you remember
sleek then you know you know your old
school but they've got really good stuff
that's really affordable for people this
is just a really super basic casual I
barely even there I think this works
more for an everyday makeup anyway I'm
gonna go ahead and use my Estee Lauder
liner it is the little black liner which
has got two ends I really like this and
the pointy end to do this and the
struggle to make this line look
respectable is really real people I'm so
sorry you're going to use the new
mascara from Maybelline on my
non-existent lashes but I always wear
falsies anyway so my lashes of the law I
always wear lashes I really like these
ones I've got a link in the description
bar below because I also have a discount
code and I'm gonna go ahead and just add
some powder to my face as well which
kind of helps to choose in everything
out I use the Ben Nye powders I use
topaz and banana play basically combined
equally I've heard a lot about session
I've also heard a lot about what I use
the Laura Mercier as well but this is
company my fave and I don't waste them
so I'm gonna keep using them and I
basically follow the same line as my
concealer and then just down here as
well which is really good for like
framing the face and I'm just going to
basically dust that off I don't like it
to look too baked and nowadays it's all
about the glow and it's all about the
juice
but for the oily people some powder is
necessary you know and I've been loving
the NARS and Stephen Klein collaboration
to highlight this is a duo called
vengeful and I use this on along my nose
and I use it on my cheeks as well now
this isn't everyone's taste but I really
do like the way this look it kind of
makes you look like a fairy that looks
so nice in my opinion you know you're
feeling yourself you're like oh today I
have those moments once in a while so
for my lips I'm keeping it really really
natural at the moment I'm using a line
art from Kiko I think the color is three
one four it's basically a chocolate and
I'm going to add this color which is my
favorite is called buff from Illamasqua
oh my gosh it's so buff there's lots of
shape and dimension to my lips so guys
that is my updated highlight and contour
routine and it's a very natural kind of
everyday look and I've been loving kind
of just a bit more of a warm up but kind
of jewy and like the soft and like
natural like everything kind of look I'm
sorry I don't know how many annotation
is that annotations I don't have any
things I had to say just there but this
is basically what I'm doing at the
moment I'm making makeup that little
more on the kind of natural beauty side
but obviously still kind of highlights
and contours my face and gives me that
dewy glow so I hope you guys enjoy and
I'll catch you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
