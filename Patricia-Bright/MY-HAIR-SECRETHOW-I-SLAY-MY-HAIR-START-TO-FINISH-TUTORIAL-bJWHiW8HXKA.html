do well so yes I'm looking a little bit
different because my real hair is out
again I feel like you guys have been
seeing my room hair so regularly these
days it's been five years and then BAM
get to natural hair videos and yeah
today I wanted to show you how I lay my
wigs and my weaves and I'm not going to
tell you that it's rocket science
because it really really isn't but all
you basically need is high quality hair
a good closure and a little bit of
technique and as I say that I'm not the
inventor of any of these methods and
I've been able to learn from so many
people on YouTube who are so skilled
when it comes to hair and they make it
attainable for any girl to basically lay
a wig layer weave and sway so I'm going
to give you guys a quick insight into
one my hair then the extensions I wear
and then how I do it so my hair is
natural and it is not relaxed however I
do have it pressed I have my pressed my
hair pressed probably about a week or
two ago at radiance hair salon and my
hair is short very fine but and that's
the way I stopped relaxing my hair
because it was just so fine that if I
relaxed it just looked super thin and
stuff so that's my hair after it's been
pressed it presses out super straight as
well which is kind of cool so if I want
to do like sleek hairstyles I can do and
I've been doing that quite a lot
recently but I like to keep it straight
now because it prevents my ends from
knotting up whereas when I keep my hair
natural or braided for some reason that
ends just always ends up being quite
just not a good way but because my
hair's pressed and flat it means that I
can wear my wigs and weaves over it as
much as I want to so when it comes to my
hair styles and my weaves and stuff I
wear white hair so white hair is my own
brand of hair extensions which I
launched about seven
eight months ago to like everybody else
but I've been wearing this brand of hair
for a very long time and I really trust
my suppliers and they've just done me so
so one I knew I wanted to bring
something quick and easy and simple to
the market so yeah I normally wear satin
here which is a straight texture or I
wear a body wave and sometimes you go to
see me when I get a bit excited and I go
for a curly hair and usually where were
you part which is basically my hair
extensions are sewn onto a cap and I
used to do this myself but I'm not going
to lie I'm so lazy that I basically use
a couple of hair stylists but I really
trust I'll link their pages and stuff
down below ok so I wear ivory apart
without the closure so I have my own
hair on top alright sometimes use a
closure and recently I've been wearing a
frontal so a frontal is net all the way
across the front and then the rest is
your standard tracks at the back and why
I really like the frontals because they
give you a really nice flat and smooth
finish like it looks super seamless and
natural so here is one I had made
earlier and this is a unit that I had
been wearing recently and it's so
strange what it looks like just like
this but this is it ladies and gentlemen
this is really it it's satin and it was
cut into this long bob a little bit of a
razor look of love Bob's your uncle and
Bob's your uncle and it's a really nice
piece so the key thing I think about
getting a really natural-looking wig is
to always have the nots bleach but make
sure you go to someone who really knows
how to bleach your knots properly if not
you're going to end up with a lace
closure that looks rod headed and my
unit has an elastic band again this is a
method that's used by so many girls on
YouTube but I'm going to go ahead and
show you what I do but what I do is
basically let's get excited
flip oops II don't even know what I'm
doing
so yeah I'm good to go yeah obviously
not however as you can see it looks
relatively natural but what I do is I
pull it back and there was a comb at the
back that I put into place you push it
into place to get it just over my
hairline and I do have quite a forward
hairline so sometimes my baby hairs kind
of stick out but that's fine I just lay
it as much as I can over and what it
will end up looking is a bit like this
we see that it is lace all the way
across to here so the gel that is the
gel of the moment is the got to be
Schwarzkopf gel and I find that it
really does give you really good hold
almost like a glue but you can wash it
out and for me I think it's quite
important to wash out regularly I
probably wash out mine every other day
if not I feel like you get a little bit
of buildup so as you can see it's quite
forward but it looks a bit like weird
just there like it's kind of lifted so
you don't have to do this but it does
make a difference what I like to do is
separate some baby hairs and using an
old toothbrush I just brush those
forward and some people can kind of go
overkill on the baby baby hairs I try
not to do that
right - happy
so with the spiking gel all I do is put
a just a touch on my finger and I use it
to gel the net down so you probably
can't see it because it really is quite
seamless and go perfectly with my skin
tone and I just put that down the very
front of it
I basically gelled these downs based on
how much baby hair
I want brush it into a little shape a
little bit of a wave I can go all the
way down to the end if I want to
especially if I potentially want to wear
my hair up but I don't so I'm just going
to leave it at that
and it looks a touch white because
obviously it's still wet but I can brush
the excess off and when it dries it
won't look so shiny gotta be you gotta
be here to be you rib mm-hmm
why is the product reminding there b2k
somebody turn right I'm going to do the
same on the other side with the front
tools oh great that is basically how I
lay the baby hairs and they might close
you down but again I've got quite a lot
of baby hairs but I've been really
loving this kind of look at the moment
and what I then use is some old tight to
just lay there and I lift up the part
just after so that this bit doesn't get
all right stuck down and stuff
and like a ninja and basically I just
sit here for a little bit and yeah I
look kind of creepy but it really does
lay them down and it helped it helps the
gel to dry out as well all right I'm
lovely and dry and load so easy I don't
call it all the time but I feel like it
just needs a bit of a fresh bump
underneath this color here is one of my
favorite it's from waaw waa like I've
never seen like I'm twisting it not by
the handle but by at all it's got
the great thing about closures there are
so many styles that you can do so even
though wearing this like flat middle
part right now I can part it anywhere I
want to and I can basically do like half
updo styles I can do cornrows whatever
so guys that is basically it for me
honestly it takes about five to ten
minutes in the morning and this is why
I'm such an avid wig wear because I can
keep my hair really kind of protected
and safe underneath and kind of Tidy
but I can switch up my look all the time
and I used to be super embarrassed about
like wearing wigs and Weez they're not
wanting to talk about it but when you
see just everybody wearing wigs and
weaves the celebrities are all wearing
wigs and weaves they're all wearing
frontal enclosures
you know and I'm talking about women
across the spectrum or wearing them why
not you know just come out here and
share your secrets really there's me
who's someone who's got quite thin hair
naturally it just feels lovely to just
be like slow this and then change it up
to thick long curly hair another day or
an afro another day so yeah I'm a big
fan so guys I will catch you later I
will have a video up on Tuesday maybe on
Thursday and again I will be uploading
on Saturday morning so stay tuned for
that and so watching guys and I'll see
you later bye hey guys welcome up to my
channel so today
I'm going to do a cheap toy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
