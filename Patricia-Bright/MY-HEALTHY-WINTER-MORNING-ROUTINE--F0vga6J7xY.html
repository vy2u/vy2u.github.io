healthy winter morning routine I love
these videos so I hope you enjoy first
things first I am really not a morning
person as you can see look at my face
but it's always about the head scarf
obviously I turn off my alarm clock and
I always reach my dressing gown because
it is ice cold and I hate being cold in
the morning and one of the things I
started to do is actually have a big
glass of water and a multivitamin on an
empty stomach and that's a big change
for me because I'm not a big water
person or a vitamin person but it is
great for like energizing and making
your metabolism work really well now you
guys know I am a tea Queen and this is a
spiced winter tea from t peak which I
got over the Christmas period I'm trying
to not have as much English breakfast
tea as I used to
it's my absolutely favorite but I'm
trying to decrease my caffeine next up I
go ahead and I make my breakfast I
basically have the same breakfast every
day
as well as preparing my smoothie for
lunch my breakfast is basically boiled
eggs high protein really feeling really
good for you along with tomatoes and rye
bread like rye bread is my new thing I'm
not having brown bread anymore and I'm
sticking with the rye bread and avocado
again it's slow burn so it keeps you
full for longer next this is my smoothie
that I have for the entire day it's
vegetables and fruit and protein and
this is kind of my lunch and snack and
then they have dinner as you can see
this is my protein will the blender
blend I've had this for about four
months it's kind of empty now but
vanilla is my favorite which is what I'm
going to use whatever I've got left in
this blend but there's also the
chocolate as well that I can add with
just water but for now I'm just going to
chop up my veggies and get them all
together it Michael doesn't really like
this mix but I've got really used to the
taste of it it's
and a little bit more veggie ish but
that's why I really like adding about 3
scoops of my protein powder here and
it's a vanilla as well which makes it a
little bit sweeter and I find that it
makes it a little bit more filling for
longer and my trusty nutribullet is the
way I just blend it in about 5 seconds
flat I absolutely love this thing you
guys clearly know that and what I do is
that I basically separate this out and
put it in the jar that I'm going to use
for the rest of the day I can
refrigerate this and just carry it
around with me and then the rest I have
for my breakfast my breakfast consists
of this it's eggs and I'm using pink
salt which is a little bit better for
you and that is me ready next it's all
about my working out I try to do
high-intensity workouts and about 20 to
30 minutes a day these are from the
Skinny Bitch worker and you can see I'm
wearing the new misguided active range
and why I like exercises like this that
genuinely really do cause the burn and
it is just really making a difference in
my body and they may look easy but
honestly do this for 13 minutes by the
time we've done like 20 reps of this
your knees will be shaking and I know my
form is not perfect I'm not an expert so
please use caution and I'm just you know
I'm working on it I will get there i
also do add weight and it makes so much
difference you can even see I'm kind of
shaking with it but I like the way it
makes me feel and I feel a lot more
energized in the morning when I work out
so then I go ahead and have a shower I'm
using my doctor Lancer cleanser it's a
really gentle cleanser which I'm loving
a lot more for January although this has
been my favorite for a while and just
scrub it up my body moving on to my
makeup I am using a thermal water spray
because again in the winter my skin's a
lot drier and I'm using the million
dollar moisturizer from lush to
moisturize as well as the into the blur
from the body shop which I put
underneath my makeup I'm going ahead and
using my everyday foundation which is
the Giorgio Armani luminous silk and my
concealer moving onto my brows I have
this booty that I basically stole from
Mac and I use a gel and a really thin
brush to just meeting it out and conceal
around the rest I'm adding a bit of
powder as well to mattify everything and
now I'm using the new Tarte lip palette
it is gorgeous it's in my favorites for
sure it's a beautiful nude palette that
just is gorgeous on all skin tones and
blends gorgeously and then I go ahead
and do a winged liner
I'm just doing a liner on the top and
I'm not really wearing mascara but I am
wearing falsies I then go in and line my
lips with this liner from Kiko and this
so either lipstick which I thought smelt
a little bit funny and I have this
little bit of brush here which is from
Bobbi Brown and finally my lashes moving
on to my hair I have changed my
hairstyle
I'm loving the middle part I tried to
dye my hair purple and I failed I ended
up with this so I'm gonna go to a
professional
in the meantime I'm just simply adding
some serum and I love the whole hair
behind it a look as it's so 90s and I've
gone back to an old classic which is
dark and lovely I'm keeping it a lot
more simple and I find that it's just a
really moisturizing gel to use on my
edges and it is alcohol-free which is
why I really like it
and I just sleep that hair back with a
slick brush and add a couple of baby
hairs and should say quote-unquote baby
hairs they're not really my edges are
relaxed and that is basically my
finished look it was really easy to do
my morning routine usually takes about
an hour and this is my finished look
this is all about me getting healthy I'm
making a change in my body so make sure

got a full strategy for like my health
and fitness routine and you can take a
