today I wanted to show you this look
here but I kind of wanted to do kind of
a juhi glowy look as summer is almost
here although in England its ice-cold
and I know how hard it is for those of
us with oily skin to achieve a look that
is glowy and highlighted versus looking
greasy the struggle is really real when
you have really oily skin or even
combination skin and you want your
highlight to be brighter than so many
people's futures and not to be an oil
slick so I wanted to kind of show you
how I do that and I think it's really
important to focus on what you do to
your face beforehand to give you the
right kind of base and then focus on
what you put on top of your foundation
and stuff like that and I still use
powders and everything even if I am
doing kind of a Julie look just because
I know that in like three hours I'm
going to look like a disco ball if I
don't set my makeup and stuff but it's
really easy to do I'll list everything
in the description bar below and I
always say it's not necessarily about
the products that you use but how you
use them and if you don't use the ones
that I use there's usually an
alternative on the market that you can
do and I will do a drugstore makeup
tutorial at some point in time I know I
keep saying it I'm sorry I will
definitely get that sorted out for you
guys and any videos you guys want to see
next please do let me know because I was
feeling a bit dry and my 10 hats for
women video has done absolutely
amazingly liked it on over 2 million I'm
like guys you really like those kind of
videos so I'm gonna see what else I can
do and get things that are really really
useful for people versus just you know
trendy anyway guys I hope you enjoyed
this tutorial and I will catch you later
bye so I start off with priming my face
because I hate looking oily I'm loving
this invisiblur from Mourad which is
also an SPF and I find that it makes my
skin super smooth and super map after
that I move on to my brows and so many
of you guys have noticed that
brows have changed quite a bit I
basically draw a line on the top and the
bottom and I fill them in and I've
stopped getting them plucked or waxed or
anything like that and I just let them
grow naturally and I use a spoolie just
to soften the edges and the wonder
product when it comes to brow is a
concealer I'm using my Urban Decay
concealer which I use basically for most
of my face but it's the best way to kind
of neaten up brows after that I'm using
this gorgeous foundation from Becca and
it's a luminous foundation and this is
when I say it's all about you know
getting the glow I love this because
it's kind of got an iridescent nough
stew it I think it's perfect for the
summer but you can use any foundation
that works for your skin but I'm just
loving this one right now so I mentioned
this urban decay concealer in a video a
while back this concealer is
ridiculously amazing especially for us
oily girls
I find it dries quite quickly and it
dries very matte and it lasts all day
like if you're going to get oily it's
not going to get oily in those areas and
I love it I'm going in quickly with this
quad from Illamasqua
and I've loved using oranges on my eyes
right now which is kind of random and I
just going to use that all over my lid
and I'm using this sleek palette here
it's got a really nice kind of Daisy
white that I use on my lid and I use
this as a trick to make my lids look a
little bit bigger because my lives are
super small I go ahead with a darker
Brown just to add a bit of dimension and
now go ahead with a liquid liner as well
this one here is the Mac's
Maybelline Inc one excellent
and I'm going ahead my false lash sculpt
mascara from Mario as well on my baby
lashes but I usually go ahead and wear
falsies I like to use foundation to
conceal this is the double we're in
mahogany and I just do it across my nose
and I usually just use my fingers to
blend it's really easy and then I just
do the sides of my cheeks as well I
don't know why I just like the way
foundation local versus powders now this
stuff is the miracle product for us
wiggly girls their setting powder from
Sascha is great and I use it under my
eyes I use it on my chin cheeks just
kind of contour a little bit and I just
rub it in and I think I bet you just put
some top powder on as well now for my
glow I'm using this Illamasqua
highlighter which is literally
everything and I try to do it quite
carefully because you can go a bit
overboard with your highlight but this
is just gorgeous I just do it on the top
of my cheekbones and I also do it down
the bridge of my nose as well and I add
a touch to the top of my neck now this
is another really nice product from
Becca I think it's kind of like a whole
glowing range basically this is a
gorgeous blush that you can clearly see
I'm loving for my lips I go ahead and
line with Bobbi Brown's chocolate is a
really nice liner but cuz the rest of my
face is feeling kind of durian glowy I'm
going to go in with a matte lipstick
from YSL which I just love this soft
color and that is me basically done
so guys that is my finished look
hopefully you can see that I'm not kind
of highlighted and Joey and I hopefully
it's easy to do for anyone who might be
trying to recreate a lot that I do and I
always say I'm not makeup Pro I'm
definitely an enthusiast who likes
transforming my face once in a while so
guys I hope you enjoyed that video and I
will catch you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
