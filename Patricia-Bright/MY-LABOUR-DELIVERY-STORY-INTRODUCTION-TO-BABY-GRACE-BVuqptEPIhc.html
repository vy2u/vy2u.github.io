say hello to every contraction I was
like and as I got a screaming like a
little world a beast say yeah five ever
my sit two cup of tea we were we're a
mess we were just a boiling mess hey
guys welcome back to my channel today we
have an introduction to this little one
here to baby grace and I decided that
this is so weird okay because I'm
sweating so much
hey guys welcome back to my channel I'm
kind of whispering and being a little
bit careful because we have a new
addition to the Patricia bright family
and this is baby grace she's here and
wants to say hello and she's currently
sleeping because she is kind of drunk up
on the milk right about now which is
always lovely and she is four days old
and I thought my favorite just wanted to
bring her up here and just let her say
hello to all of you guys hello family
hi I'm I'll be honest like the best way
to try and have a conversation is with
the baby that is actually asleep because
if she's not asleep it would be a little
bit great great but um she came into
this world in a hurry impatient like her
mum and my vlog has gone out and it was
probably one of the most emotional
moments of my entire life
let me stop fronting let me give you a
full-blown labor and delivery firstly
mostly introduction so this is grace
grace this is everyone Grace was 8
pounds she's four days old and she's a
beauty and she kind of looks like a baby
picture of Michael but also a baby
picture of my little sister is well
Maureen she's got these fat cheeks
basically which she gets from her mama
and so here she is
I wanna go ahead and give me back the
labor and delivery story I thought that
oh there she goes - it changed she's
dreaming about milk that's what she drew
it but there's no rhyme or reason to
this video but um it was just meant to
be an introduction basically she came on
a hungry on Monday at 7:00 at 28 and
what happened is that I started feeling
like contractions really kept that
really soft ones like the ones that you
might have like a few days before so
like pre labor and then I went to the
triage and they said yeah it's gonna be
at least a lot more hours if not a few
days so try and get some rest because I
wasn't dilated and I got back home about
four o'clock in the morning
and then from about 4 o'clock in the
morning I started to have just these
really intense and contractions and I
just was like if this is early labor I
can't do this it was so painful and so
fast as I what what's going on and
because the doctor had sent me home I
was like and basically said it could be
a few more a lot more hours or a few
days I was just like I could not do this
for a few hours I was like if this is a
few more hours you need to like you know
give me the drugs right about now it
became so bad I asked Michael to call
the hospital again and then they said
okay yeah come in we'll give her some
pain relief and I think it meant like um
code room or like something like
paracetamol ibuprofen something along
those lines and then Michael's like okay
try and come let's get down the stairs
and I physically couldn't get down the
stairs close in so much intense pain it
was really really intense and then from
the next contraction when that was done
I went down the stairs and then like oh
oh oh oh that was a bit
stretch stretch then I went down the
stairs in the living room and by this
time like I didn't have any water
breaking or anything like that just
really intense pain I got down the
stairs and I got to the living room and
I was basically crouching on all fours
and then I heard like a pop and then my
waters that broke like on the living
room floor I was like my my waters have
broken
but again usually when waters break it
doesn't mean that the baby's coming
straight away lots of women go 24 hours
after their waters break and some even
longer as well and then my water broke
on the floor and then I was in so much
pain I said I was like physically wasn't
going to be able to get into Mike's car
I could I couldn't do it and I said I
was like Mike you need to call 999 you
need to call the ambulance because I
can't I couldn't move I was in I was in
dying agony like shaking Quivers like
there's something wrong I'm in so much
pain I don't know I'm in this much pain
this can't be normal and then within
about five to ten minutes by this point
in time it was about 6:30 a.m. and the
ambulance came it was three lovely
ladies who came and they are like and on
the phone they're like can you see ahead
I was like no they would there's not
you're going to see ahead I'm not even
dilated so there's no head but I'm in so
much pain there's something wrong
there's something wrong and then and
then like the ambulance people because
they're not Midwest they didn't really
check they just check to see that I was
okay but they did check a heartbeat of
the baby or anything like that but they
checked and there was no head or
anything like that
and so they just gave me loads of gas
and then I was like I was high on
gasoline I was just like - every
contraction I was like and as I got
screaming like a little world a beast
right it was not even a joke and then
they were like okay on the next
contraction you really need you to get
up and we really need you to get to get
inside the ambulance and then Michael
decided to drive behind me because he
had all the stuff in the car got into
the ambulance and I couldn't sit down in
the ambulance I couldn't write down I
basically was on the stretcher on all
fours and then I was just saying this is
so painful and I was like I really need
to poo so I really really need to poo my
god and it's a little bit much and then
and then what happened and then they're
like just breathe just breathe briefly
the contractions and I put my hand
between my legs and I could feel the
baby's head and my heart basic my heart
basically sank I was like I'm going to
give birth in an ambulance Michael's not
here this is not what I dream this is
not what I planned why is this all
happening so fast but I was like I was
like high on the gas in there and I was
in literal agony because this all
happened really really quickly and the
ambulance guys were driving quite slow
there was no blue lights or anything and
then all of a sudden I was like I said
to them please don't let my husband miss
the birth of this child because I
thought the baby was about to come out
in the car in the car there and then
because I felt the hair in the head and
they like don't don't you know don't
touch you don't spread an infection blah
blah blah and then I was just like
please please please but I would have
I'd rather ask pull over and let's give
birth and it let at least let Michael
see then I heard them call the hospital
and everything and then eventually we
arrived at the hospital Michael wasn't
there and then there were two midwives
who came to the ambulance car I remember
hearing all of this and I hear them say
we can't deliver in the car park because
it's too cold I was like Jesus we were
talking about car park delivery I was so
confused
and so I was still on the ambulance
stretcher and they took they like
stretching me too much
Manatee and then we got in the lift
Michael was in the lift with me I don't
know where he came from but appeared and
then we got into the room and I had to
move from the stretcher on to an actual
bed bed which was ridiculous because I
had the top of a baby's head out coming
out my Banani within about ten minutes
and this woman came out all guns blazing
and I was a bit nervous because I could
hear them saying they couldn't hear the
baby's heartbeat but they said it's
because of the position I was in and
because she was already crowning and you
know it was very awkward and I'm on a
stretcher and the room was filled with
all these people not it wasn't like a
normal you know in some deliveries that
hits a normal but we have a three
ambulance staff to doctors Midwife my
you know just it I felt like the room
was packed but everyone just wanted to
get you know the baby out safely because
it had all happened quite quickly but
that's basically it after that I felt
elated you know it's really like
euphoric I don't know if that's what
always happens but after the birth it
was very very euphoric because I was
just like she's here this happened so
quickly
how was she here and if you watch a
video you'll kind of see there's like a
I'm really kind of in shock like this
happened and then I felt like a trooper
for a moment but my blood pressure is
really low and then within a few hours I
was able to like have a cup of tea like
I should have shot the vlog of me like
say yeah I'm five when I sit - cup of
tea as like Patricia you seriously that
person's like yeah I'm a person and then
yeah I delivered at 7:28 I was out by
five which was honestly so miraculous
but um you know it was amazing and then
ever since then we've just been chilling
Ilyn I've kind of been a bit bored if
that makes any sense I mean not bored
with her I love her but she just sleeps
eat so as I said a healer will let me
film a video and introduce her she's
been on my snapchat literally every
single day I had my mum and sister come
run every day Mike's parents came down
from Manchester for a few Dale oh that's
a big stretch turn your hand please look
how big her head is like have you seen
such a fat chubby cheeks look at look at
this adorable adorable and we've just
been enjoying and you know so far visi
she's a newborn so she sleeps a lot more
and yes she eats a lot so I and waking
up but you know what I'm just going with
the flow of it so if I found it to be be
quite easy but it's only day four and
I'm not feeling too tired or anything
but over the flexibility of going to
sleep when I feel like it and and waking
up whenever I feel like it I've got no
worries in the world right now and I
will say she's definitely a daddy's girl
daddy seems to have the magic touch with
her and I just give her to Daddy if
she's being a bit you know crying and I
make I don't know what to do
daddy's got it so yeah this is a little
grace and yeah thank you all for all the
love and support and everything that you
have send on my snapchat and everything
I hope you don't get bored of seeing her
and I'm not going to obviously do loads
of like banal videos I don't really know
what to do with you have I problems of
you but she just wanted to say hello to
the bright families and her summer some
love she can feel it through the screen
of everything and I'm sure she entirely
appreciates all of you guys and what
else is there
I don't know what else there is to say
besides that labor and delivery story um
kind of weight is kind of like I'm just
happy that she's like out of me and I'm
happy that she's in my hands and that
she's healthy and she's well and she's
beautiful when she's well loved so I
mean I don't think anyone could wish for
anything more besides a healthy happy
baby so this is really nice to see oh
she hasn't had a shower or anything yet
so today we're probably gonna give her
her her first bath and see how she deals
at that
I wonder she the mere fish like her dad
or she's gonna hate water like her mama
oh and me how I feeling I'm feeling
really good if that makes it it mean
maybe because I didn't get the chance to
have any kind of like medicine or
anything to kind of settle me and
everything was natural thing that the
recovery is different so I was expecting
you know to struggle with breastfeeding
or I was expecting to you know being a
little pain down below
and but it actually hasn't been too too
bad but no I felt fine breast as you can
see are looking all kinds of rusty and
huge and they are going through the
engorgement stage right now but she is
you're helping me get all the goodness
out of it because they've gotten even
bigger which is great great and yeah I
feel good I've had a little mommy
makeover I've got curly hair in which
kind of made me feel a bit prettier Oh
stretch it was that wake up and it made
me feel pretty I'll link it in the
description bar below I have a discount
code and for the curls and other than
that I just energy just feel kind of
like elated but it kind of feels kind of
surreal it's like so this has happened I
had a baby I gave birth she's here now
and almost like life goes on but in a
way where there's like just so much
extra love and extra fun in my house and
people always say that I'm really
juvenile or jovial and it is probably
going to increase by 20 right now anyway
it sounds like someone is drilling
outside so I'm going to call it a day me
and grace are going to say goodbye to
you but um yeah
that is just a little introduction to
the world and my labor and delivery
story she is very happy to meet all of
you guys
and she feels your love from all around
the world so thank you guys so much
