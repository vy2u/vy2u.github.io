morning in with me is actually like I'm
one of these people who move around
quite a lot in the night and waking up
is not as seamless as it seems it takes
about half an hour for me actually to
adjust time in my eyes open but I
stretch out and I just give thanks for
being awake and the mother day and also
I try to connect my phone so I try to be
good and make the bed every morning but
you know the days when I'm late to work
yeah that bed won't be making so guys
I'm really proud of myself I have been
getting it and I have been actually
working out I go to the gym but on a
lazy morning like this I will tell you
something I think this blender line up
and get myself a quick cardio workout
I'll do hey guys can I get a thumbs up
for me embarrassingly showing myself in
my cow cracks but after that I make my
way to the bathroom I brush my teeth and
I have a shower and I keep everything I
need in my shower so I like doing
treatments most days and I love getting
see it's an amazing serum and it's
actually really natural and it really
does help with having
smooth even skin tone and I'm just using
origins plant script which is a really
nice moisturizer as well it's got a
touch of SPF finally for my body I love
astral it's a nice moisturizing cream so
finally my head scarf can come down and
I would only like you do my face
honestly it's like the laziest makeup
ever but this is if I might have to you
know leave the house or I don't know
just to look decent but half the time I
don't actually pop up you guys know I
love minimalistic hair I just literally
brush it out but wrapping at night
really makes it easier to have it nice
and neat in the morning so a lazy
morning in with me means that I have no
work and that means I'm not gonna get
bothered to dress up I'll be in jogging
pants and hoodie
so on a day in like this I will attempt
to eat breakfast and I love fruit anyway
and of course a cup of tea and I had my
remove a splash of milk and no sugar
some people think it's really weird that
I've got milk Andy but this is what I do
and that looks like a perfect brew and
I'm not eating carbs so I might start
off with bacon eggs and some Tomatoes as
well put this cetera
after breakfast I'll probably just chill
out and play catch up worsening mass on
my iPad so that's what a lazy morning in
with me looks like I'd love to know what
your perfect morning would actually be
so guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
