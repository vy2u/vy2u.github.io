am finally addressing all things
patricia's and I'm gonna be honest with
you guys
hair and questions about my hair and all
that kind of stuff is what I'm asked
about the most on this channel probably
because I wear like my hair like a
helmet or something and I change it like
every other week so that's what I'm
gonna go through today get comfortable
get a cup of tea this is gonna be a
whole hair history so it might be kind
of long I'm gonna go through my hair
history my hair tight my hair routine
and some my hair styling options I
believe this is kind of a tag so I'm
gonna try and insert some pictures or
videos that I can of like my hair story
again let's get started okay so oh and
for for for my international followers
you know this channel is a multi
ethnicity channel there may be some
times that you don't quite understand or
whatever just Google ok Google will be
really helpful I try to describe things
like what's a we've you've bought what
the natural ones hair textures I'll just
go through it as I go so enjoy and get
strapped in start from the top let's go
through my hair history
I have spin someone who's been obsessed
of hair since I was a child okay I was
obsessed of hair I used to spell all the
hair for all the girls in my family and
I used to change my hair every single
day me my sister my cousin I used to do
all over there and like the same
hairstyle my hair was always the
shortest and the finest and that didn't
stop me from switching it up literally
every hour I possibly could I would have
a fan here a fan here a fan here I was
like a peacock with all kinds of gelled
waves and all sorts of braids and
cornrows going on and the crevices and I
was the person who used to spell here at
lunchtime I had like a lunchtime
business room running while I was in
school and also when I was at university
I worked in retail but I was able to
leave my retail job - by doing hair for
students and so I used to have you know
clients used to come from Birmingham to
see me like every four weeks there's one
particular client she's actually I
needed to do her hair so I've been
passionate about hair and actually for
those of you who don't know that is how
I came onto YouTube I used to be on a
really cool forum called the long hair
care forum that forum changed my life
I'm telling you it showed me women who
were growing their hair women of color
who were growing the hair really long
really thick and just gorgeously and
these were gods who were natural these
workers who are relaxed these were girls
who were texts like these are gods of
jerrick those gods just growing their
hair and I was so so so inspired and I
wanted to take part in the journey and I
used to watch all the YouTube videos and
in the area I am Nam I heard that track
was on there everyone's video hilarious
and so I started my journey so I
transitioned to natural meaning that I
grew out my relaxed hair which is like a
chemical straightening hair for those if
you don't know that and so I grew out my
natural hair and actually trapped that
on my journey so I'm gonna try and show
you a couple of clips from that on my
channel so I had like a little short
afro path and I grew like a bigger afro
I wore a lot of wigs and lace lace wigs
that just looked like des like Lord
Jesus take the world they looked so so
bad I think I was on my natural hair
journey I'll be honest with you I love
love love the journey but I felt like it
was becoming more than about just
aesthetics and for me I totally see her
as an aesthetic thing anyway I got bored
with the natural hair I didn't like
dealing with my natural hair I'll be
honest with you I wore it braided most
of the time and the reality I found with
my natural hair was that it's very fine
and is very fragile so the more I did to
my hair the more it broke however if I
just left my hair and braided it it did
really really well so I know that in
future I'd probably lock
here because I feel like my hair would
do a lot better being in locked and a
couple of my friends I've got them in
the gorgeous fire I love lux I think
they're beautiful to them I went ahead
and relaxed my hair tracked that journey
as well as kind of wanted to stop doing
a relaxed hair journey because there was
loads of girls of amazing long relaxed
hair that I was also inspired by but
knowing me I just kind of got it I got
quite bored of it so then I went to the
hairdresser's and I cut my hair dyed it
jet-black and had a really short like
angled bob and I feel like that's one of
my go-to hairstyles when I have really
slick hair that I really like and so
after that I wore that and the thing I
found with myself is that I were a lot
of protective hairstyles so you part and
weaves I wear them all the time because
I don't really like the fact that my
hair is really fine and no matter what
being natural beat straight it just
always looked a bit find the cause some
of us just have thin hair like we can't
all have heads of thick hair my sister
has got the most amount of hair and it
grows really right long and it's really
thick be it natural be it relaxed it's
just nice like that but I just was not
genetically blessed with that kind of
mess always now keep it on short because
I just think it looks nicer when it
grows out it just looks a bit mmm
anyway a lot a lot on my entire hair
journey that I did and a lot of the
stuff that I've learned on my hair
journeys the stuff that I do till this
very day so currently my hair is relaxed
and natural so I'm in between and I've
got the best of both for us and I
realized that I basically wear weaves so
sewing in my hair is braided underneath
with like a leave out on the top I and
my edges are out I realized that I wear
weaves and you part so much but there
was no point in me continually relaxing
my hair and because it was it was
getting that kind of two or three weeks
maybe four weeks of you know living it
out you know and
look at me and my new short hairstyle
and then I got really really bored of it
and then I put like a wheelie and
there's like well what's the point of
doing that so my hairdressers suggested
that I basically um go natural and when
I want to wear my hair straight
um blow dry air however I have what they
call peppercorns okay I'm telling you I
have the peppercorns of peppercorns like
at the front of my head the level of bdb
is just the most so for me I just don't
like peppercorn life no amount of sleep
brush and you know ice gel or whatever
was making them look neat so I was like
I'm gonna like send my edges okay that's
what I wanted to do and actually I found
that I have a lot less breakage on my
edges and they finally they kind of like
filled out after relaxing them I can't
explain why that happened but it
definitely did make like a lot of
difference to me and I loved it and it
means that my hair blends more with my
wheeze so that is kind of my hair sorry
next I'm going to address my hair tight
my hair is what they call 4c or for Zedd
so my hair is like very very tightly
coiled my natural hair is very very
tightly coiled it's very it's very fine
in texture and I have the low density so
I don't have a lot of hair and it's very
porous as well so it can be very dry but
is so easy for to manage my natural hair
and the majority of the time I keep my
hair braided okay I'd gone to the
hairdresser maybe once every two months
and I'll have them blow-dry it
straighten it and I give myself a black
rinse my hair is like a dusty brown
color naturally and I do not like the
dusty Brown so I say put some black in
it I wear and that's when you guys see
me like with this barn or a ponytail so
let me quickly go through my hair
routine and let you know what I do
I basically continue to do
things I've done on my hair journey the
whole time so I wash in my condition my
natural hair or my hair within my weave
once a week at micro wash so I've got
some products here I to be honest I'm
not picky about my co-wash conditioner I
use the Garnier ultimate blends and I
also use the mazzani
conditioner that I can use number of
cheapy conditioners because it's going
to be rinsed out of my hair I do not go
and spend a lot of money on those kinds
of conditioners and I don't think you
need to be completely honest what I'd
like to do is well when I take out my
weaves
I like to do a deeper conditioner and a
shampoo so I've also got the other
Garnier it's the sleek hair restorer
with coconut oil it's a nice shampoo it
does contain soul face depending on how
my hair feels I'll use a sulfate free
shampoo but I'm happy to use this one
after I haven't shampooed my hair like a
month or I'll do like a mask with the
documentary cholesterol conditioner and
I haven't got it here with me that
conditioner I don't know if you guys
know about cholesterol it's a very very
good protein conditioner for those of
you who have quite weak hair or socking
hair I love it and I'm using their dark
and lovely Amla legend deep treatment as
well once a month when I take out my
wheeze or take up my braids so my hair
is braided and cooler out underneath so
for me the key thing that I have to
maintain on my edges and obviously my
lever that I have on top to be honest I
love to use things like natural coconut
oil whenever I go away I'm like where's
our coconut Oh where's your coconut oil
if I go to Thailand if I go to the
Dominican Republic I buy bottles of
coconut oil I absolutely love them this
is a branded coconut oil I'm not quite
sure what this is one but yeah it's a
Fairtrade one it's a nice coconut oil it
is hard at room temperature but melts in
your hand when you give it a good rub or
if it's in a hot environment so I can
sometimes I even put that on my weave
where I basically dab it on my fingers
and then press it into my braids and
then that's the way I kind of know that
my braids and wait
getting moisturize I'll do that like
every other night so I'm basically using
the whole of the doctrine of li Amla
range and I'm using the billion hair
potion I love this I'll use this on my
scalp and I can because it's got a
nozzle and a tip I can basically put it
into each of the different sections of
my hair like for my scalp and stuff
massage that in and I'll do that
probably every three days or when I feel
like my scalp feels a little bit dry and
I also use the night cream as well
another thing that I always always love
or anything that our in spray bottle so
for me it's all about keeping my hair
underneath my weaves or underneath my
wigs really moisturize so anything
that's like a combination of water and
oil I love love love this is from
Carol's Daughter this is the money
repairing anti breakage spray which I
give it a good shake and I just right
lift up each track and I'm like easy
peasy
easy peasy and then this is another one
it's you so much I don't even know I
can't tell you what's on it or in it but
what I know is I really liked it it was
from it definitely was a Carol's
Daughter product I can't remember which
one it is sorry sorry I'll try and find
a link and then I'll let you know
and finally for my relaxer the relaxer I
do do at home so basically I do my edges
I'm gonna be honest with you I do my
edges when they look picky so it's not
really like every six weeks or every
eight weeks or every three months I just
do it when I'm like okay I've got enough
regrowth it's looking kind of rolling
stony
come on Patricia it's time to just whip
it out and obviously it's a tub it's a
no mixed up so I don't have the problem
of you know the winger's don't mix it
properly and over-processing I just
don't have that I find this to be a very
very gentle relaxer but it gets my hair
really really really straight I love it
love it love it
I do reuse this quite a bit and I just
use another neutralizing shampoo
that I have at home now you're not
really meant to do that but I do that
okay so in regards to my wheeze and in
regards to my hairstyling in regards to
where I get my hair phone this is hair
that I have been using for like years
okay it's the same supplier I've used
for giving years and years and it's not
something that's like they don't have
like a fancy website or like anything
branded like that cuz they're kind of
more they're more manufacturers but I
will be selling this hair in the future
so keep an eye out I know I've said this
before people but I never had the
resources all the time to really put
into doing it properly but I do now and
I plan to do that so you guys can have
access now in regards to looking after
my wave I'll be honest I really don't do
very much it will get a wash once a week
like along with my hair I love the
L'Oreal LV it's the extraordinary or
this is I feel like everybody knows
about this it's a very very very good
serum that will make sure your hair
doesn't look dry but we're not make it
really yeah combination of the two and
it really does have that power
that's basically what I put on it I will
I will shampoo my hair though because I
don't like when hair looks greasy can't
bear it cannot bear it shampoo and
condition it and then add some serum and
then I am good to go I also use the
quick styling gel from darken lovely
super hold this is alcohol-free and I
find that the great thing about this it
does not flake and it does not go white
or crispy or dry or anything like that
this gel is electri the one and I know
it's when everyone started commenting on
edges and how they look laid is when I
was using this and relaxing okay right
no I haven't changed much netic speech a
little product change and now in regards
to the current hair that I have this is
the wavy hair that I
whirring it's the same way Pierre and I
do so in my hair myself but I have a
hairdresser who basically kids do give
wigs and new parts I'm gonna link up
below she did my Bob she's really really
good and I would go to her when I have
time but sometimes I'm just at home I'm
like I'm gonna do a weave and I just get
breathing and just do it in like two
hours it's really easy and sometimes
really therapeutic for me and then my
color was done by there both work at the
same hairdressers I met them at the
hairdresser's that amazing it's Vicky
and Marie actually I went to school with
Vicky what am I talking about David meet
her at their dresses we were just good
to go up like came 12 years ago she came
to my home and did it she used the
Garnier Nutrisse the truely blonde this
is some ridiculous hair right now it did
take this hair from jet-black to all the
way up but this hair is not processed
before it has not been dyed so it was
very easy to get the color to live if
you've got hair that has been processed
a lot or it's got dyes already on it
it's on the process as well this lifted
in like 30 minutes so kind of like a
coppery coppery yellow or whatever but
when it also has a toner in here so if
you hate when people have that kind of
yellowy orange blonde you need a toner
you need to tone your hair and the thing
is you can't really go from black to
light blonde really quickly so you have
to be careful you have to do it twice
basically so we did that and then we use
these crazy colors this isn't a color
called lavender and lavender we
basically did it twice as well to get
the color to really to really like a
price it's more it's not a purple it's
more like a lavender yeah basically but
it's kind of pinky as well I probably
need to put a little bit more in I'll
probably do another round of color and
I'm sure it would be a bit more vibrant
but I'll probably bleach it again so
that I can get it really really light
and really really
DeRay well guys that is literally 20
minutes of your life spent on me telling
you about my hair and my product I hope
I've addressed everything I possibly
could if there's anything else you need
to know please let me in the comment I
will try to answer them and we can have
a cackle laughing at a couple of my
different hairstyle that I've had over
the years and yeah that is basically it
what's my next video oh I'm gonna have a
Valentine's best shelf on you okay and I
might do lucky get rid of me like that
many times as well so let me know if
that sounds good to you thumbs up for
more detailed videos like this I hope it
