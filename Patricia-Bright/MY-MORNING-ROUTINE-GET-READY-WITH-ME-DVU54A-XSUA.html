morning routine it's been a while since
I did one leaves and he's like my
favorite videos to watch so this is one
of those mornings I've had a shower the
night before and all I want to do is
refresh myself in the morning and I'm
using the Rennes hot cloth cleanser it's
an amazing spa kind of product and you
basically use your hot cloth to kind of
get your pores to open and then rinse
off so I finally graduated to an
electronic toothbrush I'll be honest
they make your teeth feel so super clean
and I don't know what I've done without
one of these so when I'm done in the
bathroom I make my way to my room I'm
basically going to get in tightly ready
in here pull on my laptop listen to some
music
I love Jose Gonzales and I'm just going
to get my face on
I've also finally organized my makeup in
a way that really works for me I try and
share with you very soon what this is so
move on to moisturizing my face and my
lips so guys I still love the Makeup
Forever HD foundation I think it's a
little bit dark for me and for the
winter time but you know I'll use it for
now and see what I might switch it up to
later but my favourite concealer isn't
going anywhere I love how bright and
awake it makes me looking it blends in
perfectly
I then set my face if my Mac lose powder
I've also done my brows and I'm going to
use my cream blush from by Terry which
is such a pretty pink and I'm going to
use my sleek contour kit as it's my
favorite moving on to my eyes I just use
a matte color on my lid and a nice
chocolate brown in my crease so you
can't go wrong with a winged eyeliner I
do it virtually every day and this
winged eyeliner
is amazing I'll link it in the
description bar below
finally either touch of mascara and
maybe some falsies picking my lipstick
in the mornings really easy I basically
always behind my notes and I'm using a
liner called burgundy format and I'm
just adding a nude gloss on top of it
so you guys know I love my hair
fuss-free and I love my current hair
it's amazing I just give it a brush in
the morning and if I need to I'll just
add a couple more colors in with my big
Tong I am in love with this Tong as you
can probably tell when I found this it
was like nineteen quid I was like I've
been looking for you all my life and
loved it so guys that is the beauty bit
done so moving on to getting ready I've
tried to organize my closet and had a
massive clean-out and I basically
followed my regular clothes and I've got
a couple more drawers I'll show you
later but I just pull out what I'm gonna
wear and I keep it super casual so often
dressed the first place I make my way
down to is that kitchen because I'm
hungry and if you're British you know a
cup of tea is the first thing you need
in the morning my perfect tea has to
have had the bag in for at least a
minute stir for a little bit and with a
splash of milk and no sugar so I might
have a slice of toast and some fruit as
well so like that is my updated morning
routine I really hope she likes that and
I will see you guys in my next video
make sure you're following me on my
Twitter Instagram and Facebook guys I'll
see you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
