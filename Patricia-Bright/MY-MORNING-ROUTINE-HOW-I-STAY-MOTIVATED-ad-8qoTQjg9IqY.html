channel I hope you are doing well I'm
excited as I always add because autumn
is here officially I mean it's been here
officially but I love this time of year
but I know sometimes it can be really
hard to just you know be motivated and
feel good this time of year when it is
cold outside when you wake up and it is
dark and you're just not feeling like
you want to be on your a-game so I'm
sharing with you today how I like to
make sure I am on my a-game at this time
over here and this video is in
partnership with my favorite partners
diet coke if you guys don't know I
partner with diet coke as part of the
diet coke break series but you know what
we're just gonna get into this video so
the first thing is when I wake up in the
morning it's cold it is dark you know
nowadays then you wake up and it's dark
how annoying is that I hate when the Sun
is not like warming me up to like you
know you know bring me round so nowadays
I love to use a illumination clock so an
alarm clock that makes it mean lights up
slowly by slowly by slowly and then it
kind of adds the light into the room
because I'm not good with the like just
being switched on and just you know
hurting my eyeballs I need to be gently
ease into the mornings or alternatively
I have an alarm clock that is a radio it
sounds really simple but having you know
just the soft sounds of some music wake
me up in the morning also starts me off
to a better day so you guys know that I
am a month right so to be honest most of
my mornings are a jumble and it's a
routine I don't really know how it
happens but it happens and I feel like
this is really important for everybody
to kind of have a set of structures that
you do the first thing like almost like
it's amazing wake up brush your teeth
have your breakfast and have your outfit
laid out from the night before do your
walk got your train didn't have that
routine or done beforehand so my routine
is basically look like a bum for at
least the first hour because that is all
grace dedicated time to she gets ready
Herbert or her breakfast dragged to a
nursery coming back made me go Jim if I
and then after that I do all of the me
stuff on an everyday basis I'll attempt
to try and just keep it really simple so
I have a little dressing area I'll you
know have a shower brush my teeth put my
moisturizer on and put on a casual house
outfit I have like that house outfit
that I wear all the time I kind of live
in it sometimes it's a bit you know
crusty but that's fine where my casual
house outfit and then at least if I've
done all of that I can start my day and
that's if I'm not going out but from I'm
going out then my routines slightly
different no matter what I'm doing I
feel about having that routine in the
morning the things that I always do
every single time no matter what's
happening it's really important to
having a structure especially a routine
where I don't even have to think about
it so you guys know I'm obsessed of
organization and planning all that kind
of stuff so I try to always have like
some key tasks in my head or in my
notebook from the day before and so I've
got this thing when I try to do three
tasks a day it doesn't sound like a lot
of tasks but usually it's quite hard to
get three tasks done a day and but if
you're someone who finds you're a
scatterbrain you have like a massive
to-do list like I feel like those
massive - look do lists are really
annoying because they're hard to get
them actually done but if you have
freaky tasks that you try to achieve a
day it's much easier to get the stuff
done and then I will attack the biggest
task first so one of the tasks that I
have been completely and utterly
avoiding has been clearing out my closet
and I know it doesn't sound like a task
but I just get breathless at the thought
of just looking at the clothing editing
is another task one I actually sit down
to edit it's like four hours and I
always wait till last minute to do it
but nowadays I'm like right my three
tasks do my biggest task first and then
try and achieve all of them and then I
feel a lot better at the end of the day
when they are done so usually when I've
done like my biggest tasks that are you
i I do at home I will try and get out to
my office to go and meet with everyone
to actually go do paperwork and emails
and contract and I find that
is life like everybody has to do
annoying paperwork and gritty and taxes
and accounting and I mean some of us are
like city workers some of us are college
workers at the end of the day getting
down to nitty-gritty on pen and paper or
on laptops or email is literally part of
life you know if you have been sitting
at your laptop all day long and writing
and doing dissertation and doing
proposals sometimes you need to have a
little bit of a break so I like to take
a little bit of a break in the middle of
the day as well which we all do and take
a walk I read a book I might even have a
diet coke take a little bit moment where
I have at least 15 to 20 minutes which
is complete and utter downtime from what
I have the normal mundane running of my
day because if you never take a break
your brain just goes my brain fizzes
so much when I'm just like at the laptop
a screen just staring at it all day and
I know my students relate to this job I
think everybody relates to this that
just screen time screen time screen time
are you having screen time right now as
you're watching this video probably take
a little break have a moment do
something that inspires you or excites
you you know have that little break in
the day it's so so important and often
when you have that break
you might even read a book that you've
been planning on reading you might go
outside you might even just go do some
jumping jacks when you come back you
actually feel a lot more refreshed after
doing it now after my break my day
continues as normal and I'm very
convenient of you you know most of my
days are kind of average there's a lot
of filming a lot of editing a lot of
meetings a lot of phone calls all that
kind of stuff and once I'm done I be
really consistent nowadays about being
done by like 6:30 I'm almost always done
by 6:30 come home have dinner with my
family chill and then call it day and we
start again
so guys I just wanted to give you a
little bit of insight into how I slay my
autumn days I know this time of year can
sometimes be a little bit hit or miss
with people I know it gets a little bit
cold and you're just feeling a little
less motivated but I wanted to give you
guys a little bit of a pet show you how
I like to motivate myself during this
time of year and what I actually do so I
hope you found that interesting but in
the meantime I will catch you guys later
thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
