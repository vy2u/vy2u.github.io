another tag and it's going to be my most
worn thing tag and it's going to be a
winter edition so I'm excited to get
started so the first thing on there is
the most worn nail polish now for me
it's definitely been read and and
usually I use a red which is from nails
inc and it's called sent James but I've
recently started using the OPI nail
lacquer and this is in a I think it's
called velvet in caviar no it's called
vodka and caviar which is a bit of a
deeper red morning George but I love
this I must say it also any nail polish
overwhelming I've been wearing it with
glitter and I know glitters sometimes a
bit with pain in the ass to kind of get
off but I've been loving the Barry M
glitter and this is in a gold I think
this cook yeah it's called gold glitter
and quite hard to get off by just like
adding accents and stuff to my nails
with gold glitter so that has definitely
been a favorite for me most one hair
products and you guys know I transition
between wear my own hair and wearing we
use fairly regularly but I rarely ever
put any product into my hair weaves as I
find that it kind of ways it down and
makes it lose like its movement and
stuff and I hate like stiff looking way
basically but on my real hair and which
I kind of moisturizers regularly as
possible and I'm loving the carrick air
conditioning cream headdress and it's
just like a white oh you can't really
see it's quite fluffy and really
moisturizing in it's um it's got like
all good products in it so no parabens
or you have that nasty stuffers people
like to call it and I find it very
moisturizing Ivan it on my hands might
rub it into my hair and that really
stops it from drying out so I love that
hair product my most warm bag has to be
this bag which I've got from JustFab and
it was my pick for december and i might
mention this before but the second I got
it
literally like it's my work bag now and
I love the fact that it's got loads of
compartments so I can put my diary in it
so we're 2013 diary and I can get my
laptop in it my person it and it's got
um one two three sections can I
absolutely love the detail on the front
of it because it looks really elegant
but it's really really sadly and it's
just what I need for like a work but I'd
that's really trendy as well so I love
this bag so the next question is most
worn shoes and must say I absolutely
love wearing high heels but I found that
like I'm not as good as I used to be
wearing them because I'm really
apparently when in that much so I've
kind of started wearing wedges and you
guys want to see these and these gold
worth dish I can't remember when I
bought them about summer maybe and these
have been my winter shoes because one
this way they're really really warm
they're really really high so if i don't
want confit i love these and they're
very very comfortable and they look
gorgeous would like a pair of skinny
jeans and high heels they're like the
most comfortable thing you can get so I
love these and look they look so
luscious stoneleigh they're like a
really luscious now it's not swaying
it's more like a velvet actually so most
one accessory I have multiple so i'm
going to show you all of my most worn
and accessories just because i kind of
wanted to show you so one is this fur
trim i know it has been warned to death
and i don't care i think that this is
the best thing i've ever bought like
four winter because it's so cozy it's so
so warm and like when you're cold like
just wrap it around and use it like as a
muffler as well if it's really icy cold
and even i wrap it around my head so I
know people see me walking around it's
forever absolutely love this it's it's
like the best investment it was 13
pounds for mazama and it's getting a bit
hmm because it is worn every
single day but I would definitely buy
one every single year and hopefully this
loss a little longer but I love this
like I want to wear it now but i won so
some of you might know that I hate
wearing earrings not like hate wearing
rooms I just don't like the way I look
live here in sometimes I feel like I
look like you know like a charm right
from a Chevy and stuff but it depends on
how you wear them definitely as long as
they're not too big or too garish that I
think I'm absolutely fine with them and
I've actually been wearing earrings like
yay high five and I don't know if you
can see these these are from dorothy
perkins and they look really elegant and
they're like on an antique gold on the
outside with some black and a little
crystal on the inside and I just love
the way these look I feel like I sound
so crusty I'm so sorry guys and I just
like the way these look and lovely i
have been wearing them loads like there
might go to earrings and also guys it's
got to be my fur hat just because
obviously this is the winter edition and
found that it's so cold like this kind
of exposing yourself thing doesn't
really work so this has been a little
goes in this top I don't mess up my hair
but this has been warned so much i love
this it really keeps you warm along with
that obviously can be a bit much but
when you're cold and don't think you
care and I think I've got everything on
so yeah so most worn clothing item I'm
sure you guys know this if you watch me
enough has got to be this study jumper
which is from i bought from leather lane
market so working chancery lane and
there's a market there so sometimes when
you're not lunch right there is a
nowhere else to go so i won't need to go
and have a look and see what was there
and like I went on this market store no
Furman with my sister boy first in the
dark gray I bought that already I don't
alway gosh
go to this market she's like it's
literally market this lemon play market
because we could work really close to
each other so I went down then they
didn't have her grade but they have this
gray so I was like yes I love this it
was 25 pounds now I've been accessed
expensive for something from a market
stall it's lasted very well really good
qualities when you love that just to add
because it is a winter edition i thought
i'd add most worn jacket because you
can't go anywhere without a jacket here
and minus Isle of Grain reminds
definitely got to be this jacket that i
bought from this polar bear and i
actually bought it when I was out with
the girls at levent near and i bought it
for 50 pounds amazingly warm it's got
this gorgeous lining on the inside and
it's kind of like a great speckled color
and this is basically my everyday coat
so this the ferc and good and i actually
sometimes wear my got like a woolly
waistcoat thing I were they with this as
well so I love this so my most warm
foundation and i'm not a big makeup
pertinent so I've been really trying to
get more into it and stuff and could
definitely do some recommendations for
foundations but I've been using the
match monsters in the 8.5 and I really
like it and I do hope this is the only
foundation I wear but it says what I use
under my eyes and I've also got the 8.0
but I find that to be quite cold on me I
find that this warms the upper makes you
look like more chocolatey but is great
but I really like this but again i'm not
really a foundation buff so any of the
recommendations then do let me know the
next question is most worn blush or
bronzer and i'll probably just show you
both and they're both from sneak again
actually sneak is the only drugstore
product that i actually haven't really
really like sleek and they've got some
great products and I've got this brush
kit so I just use a pink teeny and pink
puff eight at the end
this is a bit too Barbie for me but I
find that these when they like rubbed in
really really good and won't pick coffee
on me now and this is just my regular
flash I'm not one for changing the
products very much and I don't have a
massive makeup collection although i'd
like to but once i know something works
it's very rare for me to change it and
in terms of blush i wanted to show my
contour kit which is from sleep and it's
in the dark and i love this this is what
i use to contour and i use this to
highlight as well i've also got the NARS
and orgasmic illuminator which I think
it's going to be my new favorite by
haven't worn it enough to say most one
thing so the next question is the most
worn lip product it's definitely got to
be in lipstick and it's a lipstick from
Mac and it's called touch and I actually
love this and bought this just on my way
to Spain in duty free it was so worth it
this is like if you're brown dark brown
and you want a nude that doesn't look
really like dry or a she this is
basically the nude for darker and
skinned girls is absolutely lovely you
can without a lip liner I just slide
this on so I absolutely love this
lipstick so the next question is the
most more mascara and mine is the inner
that's why l'oreal it's the volume
million extra black lash and it's about
10 pounds and this is the only mascara I
have the other mascara i use i basically
use them finish use them finish I don't
buy for a time or anything so this is
obviously going to be my most one and
again this was another recommendation
for my sister who had this and I notice
a looked really good on her and I said
what is that she like it's this so i
love this as well and the final quest on
there is the most worn i shadow and I'm
not much of an eye shadow
where I don't do like elaborate makeup
or anything like that and when you chose
90 99 percent of the time so you'll be
looking at a either of gold or bronze or
nearly down on my eyelids but then I
always use a dark brown but if you can
see but i always use a darker brown to
just create some shape and some depth
and i love max embark for doing that so
i use this every time I do a darker
shape on my eyes as well just because it
creates like death and it looks nice and
stuff like that so guys that is my most
one thing tag and this is the winter
edition and I'm going to take a few
other people in the description box as
well and if there's any other times you
guys want me to do is I said I'm
definitely going to try and do a lot
more tags and this year and anything
else you want to see from me let me know
so thanks for watching guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
