today I'm going to do my loft slash
attic room kind of bedroom tall and I'm
not the kind of person who usually do
these kind of like home to all kind of
things especially because it's quite
personal because this is where me and my
husband both sleep and stuff but we have
been on a journey that has basically
taken three months where we've basically
transformed the loft of our house which
is basically a dusty spider-infested
storage place and made it a bedroom we
currently live in London and we don't
have the luxury of having massive homes
and stuff like that and basically we do
own our house and the only thing you can
do if you want more space is basically
move which is really really expensive or
you can basically add some more square
footage to your house which sounds
really boring and all people but it's
true we decided that we wanted to do a
lot as well so it's been a massive
building work journey which actually has
been quite difficult on me I don't know
if you've ever had building works in
your house but when you have traded
trades no traipsing for your house at
like 7:30 in the morning because they
usually start really early and like all
you hear is work better like just
drilling and noise when you are you know
six months pregnant to nine months
pregnant it is quite a lot to deal with
but we did all of that and then we have
made it to the other side now the bit I
really like is when it came to the
decorators I'm going to kind of share
with you some of the key bits and bobs
that I have in here and then just show
you around the room basically so here is
a loft space which is basically a nice
large double room buy in London standard
and obviously it has a sloped roof
because it is built in the roof and we
have a dormer and a balcony that opens
up to the back garden which is actually
really quite nice and I'm excited for
the summer so my bed is a king sized bed
which is from next and I love the kind
of gray and the button back Aditi
I love button back um but the last bit
was a double bed as in like it's hard to
really fit in king-sized beds into room
but we've got lots of room here and like
you I cannot treat ourselves to a
king-size bed
we also have built-in closets which were
done by our carpenter because again you
sloped rooms it's really hard to find a
slipped wardrobe and you know storage
system and realistically most of them
don't really work that well for a space
as specific as a ski area the focal area
of this room is basically this area
behind me and it's like my feature wall
that I was like I really wanted a
feature wall and I think Matt being on
YouTube and stuff we kind of go for the
white walls it's kind of been a trend
for so long and I realized that I was
kind of over it so I went for this
really nice gray color on the walls
which I absolutely love and then I have
this have kind of feature feature prints
wall my prints are from a Desio which
are absolutely amazing if you do not
know about Desio make sure you check it
out and go to link them in the
description bar below they have got so
many prints so much inspiration I
basically copied and one of their walls
that they had created and I basically
recreated it for myself in the same way
the prints are very affordable they're
excellent excellent prints there between
you know five pounds 10 pounds 15 pounds
but they're really really good quality I
love the one that says be bold or be
italic but never be regular I love that
one but you guys have to check out the
site because they've got so many prints
I each have a box of prints because I
ended up buying so many so many extras
the next piece I have that is a lovely
feature piece is this lab stand from
next everybody on my Instagram been
asking me like where's your lamp from
it's a little bit pricey actually for
and now depending on how much it
spending that's about 80 pounds but I
felt like it was a really nice yeah it's
a copper and brass kind of stand with
the black hood which I thought was
really really pretty and suited this
space entirely the chest of drawers are
an Ikea Chester drawers and basically
when it comes to Ikea there's I
the mouth everyone has the mouth I love
them all it's a classic but I don't
really want the mouth and this one I
can't remember what this set of drawers
is called
but what I like is that you can add your
own combination together and so Michael
has five of these and I have a couple of
I have I four of these because I have
another room downstairs
but why basically keep in here is
basically my underwear my night wear and
my house where and because we have a
little wet room here I have like a
routine and I might do my morning
routine and then what I have is I have a
set diffuser stick I'm definitely more
of a scent diffusers that kind of go
nowadays because I feel like it gives
you a permanent aroma this one here is
also from the next this is 20 pounds and
it's really a really really big one this
scent is called Miami it's kind of sweet
and rich but the thing is you can smell
it in the room and even all the way down
the stairs and then I have this long
gold VARs which is from Dunnellon is it
called dual on me lord uhlan name I
can't remember how to say it if you
don't know about that homo store yet no
it's so affordable and they've got
everything they've got like blogs versus
faux flowers these flowers are fake
because why not one half if that is
there they have got so much stuff it's
ridiculous and next to that I have a
bookcase this kind of cute bookcase
which is from Ikea and what I do is I
have got little pullout boxes and
drawers I kind of match with the purple
and the grey and yeah I picked the boxes
up for matt'll and they're like seven
pounds each they're super affordable but
they look really good I put my everyday
like bar thing stuff in there they also
keep electrics and what electrical stuff
and wiring in it as well the other thing
I really like all my little post in my
room is filled with booze I've got brick
of this really nice cute poof from the
next it's a 31 and I found that in this
room I was like I feel like you don't
have anywhere to sit and I just like
sitting on post in room rather than
sitting on chairs and they also have
this poop in and the purple I have this
lovely
a gray rug as well which is kind of
shiny which is from next is what I've
also got this shelf which I basically
put some candles on another bars and a
couple of books that we've read in at
the moment and that eventually will go
into storage or go on to a charity shop
I have been on like a kind of like a
minimalism journey and I'm not saying
I'm a minimus or anything but what I've
been trying to do is to really be able
to live with less and shop less and have
less and get rid of drunk and I'm
telling you the amount of things that
I've got rid of it's insane and I kind
of had this fear like if I don't need it
if I'm not using it just get rid of it
right so I'm quickly going to show you
the wet room so we have the choice of
going for like a really big big bathroom
but having a smaller room all going for
wet room so we definitely opted for a
wet room I don't spend that much time in
the bathroom for this really cool
cabinet which uses a sensor to light up
it's excellent for that you know just
that self ego it gives you that lumineer
oh I love it it's a very small but very
functional shower room if you guys want
to see what's in my shower as well I
would definitely do one of those as well
and if I haven't showed you I do have my
makeup collection which is on wheels
which I basically drag around the room
with me wherever I'm going to go and I
keep my my most favorite makeup products
in this in this thing as well as a
little makeup bag that I use on a daily
basis and this is the way that I
basically keep all my makeup really
controlled and then if I'm not using
something I've been it and I replace it
so guys that is the end of my loft
bedroom tour I hope you guys enjoyed
that it's a little bit different for me
I don't feel like I've done I mean I've
done like a my makeup room tour but I
feel like we get into a place where it's
like okay let's show a little bit more
let's get a little bit more you know
real and open so now you've been inside
my boudoir so guys thank you so much for
watching and I will catch you later
thing imagine other virgin journals um
so I'm not quite sure we'll be gone if
there's anything you want to see let me
know I will do that and I will catch you
later thanks for watching guys bye
and all I think I've been nipple coming
out is that you know we have a nipple
and nipple on the loose it's not loose
