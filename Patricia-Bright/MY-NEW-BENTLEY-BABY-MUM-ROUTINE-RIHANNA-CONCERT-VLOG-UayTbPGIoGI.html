out late I am buying it unbelievable
okay so this is actually my first time
hey guys welcome to my channel today's
video is going to be a vlog basically
apologies for the dress darkness I don't
know I am apologizing for being dressed
up but I feel like on vlogs you're like
you're not really meant to be dressed
out you're meant to be like really basic
or not basic you're meant to be really
normal but I just shot a video so I
still am like in my video gets up please
believe this will be wiped off real
quick but I decided that I wanted to
vlog over the next few days because I've
been to the piano concert tomorrow and
I'm really excited right look at my face
I'm like a big woman but why am I
excited like this and if you guys watch
my last Q&amp;amp;A I basically haven't been to
a concert in how long in like 10 years
if not 12 years gosh I feel like I'm
getting old and I see my doing it don't
matter age ain't nothing but a number be
me nah anyway so yeah I just wanted to
share with you like the lead-up I'm
hoping tomorrow is going to be really
good I'm gonna be Shirley but yeah I
like logging so I don't get a few bits
done the little one is downstairs quiet
actually loves her playing map I said
that's why speaking so fast could you
you don't know how long it's going to
last for like pani and Nick no always
stay calm children and babies
every day you don't get to see my little
one very much right here she is
he's such a little good girl gosh she's
excited she knows the cameras on so she
decided to Danielle perform hi darlin hi
good yes
are you excited cuz mommy's going to a
concert and she's cool yes that's
exactly why she's excited are you
smiling are you smiling anywho oh I'm
looking all kinds of Gracie we were
about to go to the office I'm really hot
right now it's so humid and just really
rainy and just horrible it's ridiculous
but we are going to the office we're
actually moving to a different office
because we are taking on more people and
we wanted to be somewhere that's a
little bit more central and a little bit
more fun so I'm really excited about
that but I just go sort a couple of bits
out there quickly and then gonna come
home here at the office and the girls
are started moving things you can say
goodbye to this place I don't even want
to show you because it's so messy but
what I have noticed is that they've got
sneaky naughty things in here like
Cadbury's animals I don't even know who
these are but as the boss it means
you're entitled to stealing people's
chocolate move some people have office
dogs we have an office baby I'll compare
my little one to add or anything like
that because she's 10 times cuter and
this face is good startle fear of God so
don't be surprised if you see extra
white um whites of her eyes how cute the
sugar you write your lace some of you
guys might not know that I've been
working with PayPal and this whole
concept called new money which is
basically about ditching your old school
but leather wallet and using your
digital wallet and I for one would
definitely consider myself to be new
money all the way and I'm totally a new
money person I always use my paper cup
but basically for the next few days I'm
going to be
using paypal to power everything that I
do and where I can basically so right
about now I need to buy my outfit for
tomorrow I haven't bought it I just
found this camera jacket and I think
it's going to give me a nice little army
look I'll either do this or watch a clip
but I'm going to go ahead and use PayPal
OneTouch to get that and basically all
it means is that because I've got one
touch activated I can check out without
adding a username or password that is
the bomb I was so quick and easy I love
it not having to add in a password or
anything
we always done in the office now I miss
this place
I'll get one crime today's actually
voting day so ah i'ma go vote I haven't
done it yet but yeah I've noticed some
people so interested about voting like
they are now say I'm gonna make my claim
guys good morning guy damn it did it did
it oh my god I'm up there she's so
excited right now I don't know why I'm
too excited I've got the concept today
and it's about to be lit you know it's
about to be lit some David arts about my
morning routine I have two morning
routines I had the great morning routine
and then I have my own morning routine
so my first morning routine can either
start from 5:30 by the way look at this
one
three paintings very excited just smile
and play herself strange really strange
anywho so my first morning with keen
presently start so just basically
getting the race ready so changing her
after the night she's actually sleeping
in her own room already the cards she's
an excellent sleep art and - we can't
sleep with her in the room
it's not even her G wood and we haven't
one to turn everything and she's fine
and she usually wakes up about 5:30 I
feed her and change her and then she'll
go straight back to bed until about
eight o'clock and then she will like
wake up for a bit like the next also and
I'm gonna feed her again so I end up
like washing bottles and stuff like that
I like doing washing up training her
doing laundry so I try and get that all
down done first which is why working my
last morning routine you didn't see that
you don't need to see any of that I this
is that the unglamorous part of life and
I expresses well because she doesn't
drink
on the breast but she goes through
breast milk so I have to like kind of
double my feeding efforts closer to the
exposure as well yeah that's what it
basically looks like a bit money in the
morning some complain to me why kids so
excited by these cells what you didn't
even get this excited around me but
she's by herself little thing to stare
what this will about grace
so looks like my parcel has come and
I've already started to put like my
outfit to get them and stuff but I'm not
sure if I'm acting away there so let's
see what it looks like

want to wear this I put Baron teabag to
wear but the jackets cute

up our food shopping you know the work
of a mummy has still got to be done
right I'm gonna put petrol in my car
right now and this is something that I
usually don't do as you guys know I'm
not the best driver in the world and I
usually leave Michael to help me with
everything but I'm going to use the
shell motorist app and use PayPal to pay
for it
so right now I'm going to use the fill
up and go service I don't know what my
pin is Pepsi how cool is this stay in
your vehicle I know it says fill up and
go here with our speedy payment service
