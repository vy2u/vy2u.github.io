today I'm going to do a makeup tutorial
for you and this has basically been my
most popular ever oh that boob keeps
popping out just there as it keeps doing
so today is going to be a really popular
look that I did recently and so many
people have been commenting on like the
way that my makeup looks different and
everything thank you so much I've been
stepping my game I won't like I've been
really watching those Instagram makeup
artists and see exactly what they do and
actually genuinely applying their
techniques and I haven't really changed
the products that I'm using but I kind
of changed the way I apply it and I feel
like it cuts one of those things if you
take your time with application because
I used to always rush always always rush
through my makeup but if I take my time
with application it generally makes a
big difference on the way my face looks
and how flaky I had some some new terms
use but how flaky my face actually ends
up looking so today I am going to show
you how I create this look which is a
signature alright so I'm gonna make this
video a chatty one just to make my lips
are all kind of dry right now so I'm
just going to moisturize them I don't
want to offend you as I do my makeup so
the first thing I feel like I've been
using this more add all control a
mattifying SPF SPF 15 I've been using
this kind of as obviously an SPF but as
a base for my makeup and I found that it
genuinely kind of makes my makeup set
nicer and so I'm just going to go ahead
and put that on and this one is
genuinely like not making me blue or
oily so I've been using the Charlotte
Tilbury magic foundation this is the new
foundation the shade that I'm wearing is
dark font it's not my perfect shade
however it blends in really lovely and
yes this is how I put on my makeup
and then I'm using a stifling brush to
kind of buff that all in now that color
looks really weird but this has
genuinely been the color
been wearing oblate and my skin seems to
just come through so that is the
foundation and I'm not going to lie to
you it is a little bit different to my
neck color my neck has currently got a
little bit darker but I've been
suffering from quite bad
eczema but it's getting a little bit
better but I can just blend it down a
little bit but I'm just kind of leaving
and rolling with it now and my chest has
always been lighter than the rest of it
so I just roll with what I've got right
so I actually haven't really been
changing too many of my products and if
anybody knows I'm obsessed with the
Estee Lauder Double Wear I've been using
it for I think I'm going on two years at
this point inside people and it's not
really going anywhere and I use the
colored deep this is the old one but
they do have the new ones I'd have to
show you the new applicator stick and I
do use this color is called deep as well
I think this is absolutely amazing this
is the stick here and I can swipe that
underneath but this one's much more like
everyday but I'm going for a little bit
more of a highlighted look so what I now
do is I basically bring it much lower
and I kind of do it in a line and I was
watching and Weezie snapchat and she was
basically showing how she does it and
she brings it quite close to her nose
and it kind of fans it out but brought
it all the way down and brought it under
her nose as well I'm not going to bring
it under my nose that's probably a bit
much for me but I thought it looked
really good I basically recreated what
she did but for my skin tone and I jet
like everyone was like your makeup looks
so good Patricia like thanks guys I do
look like a bit of a weirdo and of
course I just do the line down the
middle
then here the meantime what I do is I
don't actually just blend it in straight
away I leave it for a little bit I know
that's not normal but I found that when
I leave it it kind of sets the
foundation I don't think you set
foundation but it genuinely makes a big
difference and I'll go ahead and do my
brows again so many people have been
complimenting me on my brows thanks guys
you're all so lovely I am still using a
pomade and the only thing that I'm doing
is I'm taking a little bit more time and
I've really been inspired by this like
Russian into the grandma and I was like
I want I browse like curse and how
eyebrows are so amazing so I basically
do my eyebrows a bit flatter a little
bit thicker and a little bit longer and
I just take my time well I do it and I'm
using the Anastasia Beverly Hills dip
down
and I will be honest with you I don't
think that this colors perfect for me
the color I've got is dark brown I find
it to be a little bit cold but I also
have the tinted brow gel in expresso
color which just warms it up for me a
little bit I go ahead and use the same
concealer around my brows as well and
then I'm going to go ahead and blend
everything in with a Beauty Blender I do
the line along the top I brush it
upwards and on the bottom I bring it
quite thickly around and I brush it down
energy it take a lot longer doing my
face now that might used to if I'm
trying to do this more glamorous look
it's definitely worth it the results do
really show for themselves I'm going to
go ahead and use my Beauty Blender and
I'm just going to blend it out now
obviously because the concealer has kind
of like not dry but you know it's a bit
dry on what I find is that unless I rub
off less product and I get a much
stronger result my Beauty Blender is
slightly done and yes take your time
with your blend in or what like it's a
little bit dry so I'm going to add a
touch more fix press onto it
all right so the blending does take a
lot longer when I do in this way but I
really do like the results I'm going to
go ahead and add a bit more brow gel to
my brows and then I'm going to show you
how I contour as well and I'm going to
use powder just to even everything out
so let's and go to contour I love to use
foundation to contour I'm going to use
the double way makeup to go the color
I'm using is deep amber and if you guys
have seen this but it's got a little
pump it does have its own little worm
spongy thing but I don't like using
spongy things I'm going to go ahead and
use my finger and I just contour side of
my nose I do find this foundation goes
darker with time I basically just go for
my eyebrow and on where I can fill my
bone and then just go down and who needs
a nose job when you can have contour and
then I'm going to go ahead and just dive
dive down there and this isn't really a
dark contour I can go darker than this
if I'd be honest with you just couldn't
find my other foundations of realism but
could have found it it's like deep
mahogany but this one will do I honestly
feel nice and matte right now and I
think someone someone left a comment
anyway you look really matte but with
uge that's so nice
do you know what I was looking for a
foundation and it's sitting right in
front of me it's right here and this is
rich mahogany from Estee Lauder it's
also double work and maybe a big fan of
doubler if you didn't know this already
that's what I was looking for oh my gosh
like seriously
Patricia's brain is just not working
right so that is all my foundation and
contour and all that kind of good stuff
and I'm going to go ahead and powder I'm
still using the been my powders I'm
still using phenomena and I'm still
using topaz under my eyes I don't go so
much for the banana on its own I find
it's a bit cold but I like to blend the
Topaz which is a little bit orange II
along with the banana blend it with my
very good and then just give it a little
dab dab dab and nowaday I feel like I'm
baking from delusions I don't really
need to bake the powder I don't really
need to let it sit for very long and I
don't really do that if I'd be honest
with you I just use a brush to like
swipe it all off on the rest of my face
and then go ahead and use the laura
mercier invisible loose setting powder
my friend was going on about this on her
snapchat and I had to buy it off I saw
her just raving about it and I've heard
lots of people talking about it it's a
really nice setting powder like all of
this stuff makes the difference all
right okay where are we at now this is
wrong
makeup takes its time but it's always
worth it in the end
so the look that I was wearing was it's
from the kat von d palette shade + light
eye palette contour palette it's a matte
palette I'm going ahead with the Urban
Decay primer on my eyes first and I'm
just gonna go in with the kind of beige
II and I'm definitely not an eyeshadow
connoisseur I only believe in wearing
two or three eyeshadows you don't need
eight personally I don't need a should I
say
and then there's then kind of like a
brownie purpley color here and I just
bring these all the way up I focus on
the outer corner and what you might know
is I am trying to I bring up a bit more
because I don't have much of an eyelid
so I try to keep as much of the light
here so this just adds some nice color
around here then I'm going to go ahead
with my Mac pad actually I've got a
really nice dark brown in this palette
here this is the warm neutral palette I
use it all the time
I don't want it to look to cut Creasy so
I'm just going to use my finger and
blend now because it's looking a bit too
much for me you guys know me well I
don't really like heavy heavy heavy eye
makeup so that's basically my eye area
done and the one thing that I have been
doing differently which a lot of people
mentioned that highlighted my eye shape
is I've just been lining the inside of
my eyes and I stopped lining my eyes for
you is pear quite small eyes so eyeliner
never suited eyes like mine but for some
reason it genuinely seemed to me might
make my eyes pop more when I line it I'm
just using a black liner from the body
shop and it makes all the difference I
try to focus on the outside corner as
well and because again my eyes are quite
small and personally I line my eyes in
my eyes close because it kind of helps
it kind of touch the top as well and
it's so uncomfortable to try and do this
with my eyes open
I just can't physically do it all right
then I'm going to go ahead and use my
liquid liner this is the matte liner
from Topshop this is a favorite line of
mine sorry
it's never changed
I am going in with the Clinique chubby
lash mascara this mascara is absolutely
excellent I'm actually a big Clinique
flag fan as well love the foundations
and I love the skin care as well and the
annoying thing is I always end up
somehow getting mascara on where I've
done my makeup that's so annoying if you
have any tricks on pizzette preventing
that please do let me know the one thing
I also had differently last time was I
was wearing my velour lashes again and
they're not going to lie to you these
velour lashes are the bomb they are mink
lashes I'm not sure if it's actual mink
but their main cash is and I'm not going
to lie they do look a lot better then
the shop ones that I buy all the cheapy
ones that I buy they are a little bit of
a luxury item but they do make so much
difference
I usually wear the lashes called doll me
up but these are actually another pair
and sometimes I can find that the lashes
can be a bit overwhelming so I cut into
them to kind of give me a more pointy
look and it looks so so nice everyone
was asking me about this these are these
hardcore into the ground girl ashes in
my opinion so you can actually see the
big difference with the lashes but
because I've cut into these these shoot
my eyes in a bit more and I love how you
can see like the look coming together
back in the day my makeup never used to
look like this now I've learned how to
do it I'm feeling myself okay great so
that is basically the main majority of
my face done I've got my contour on and
I lightened up on the blush people I had
heard that you're pleased and I've heard
and I have so I'm going to use the Bobbi
Brown brightening brick and I'm going to
use the gold areas to just get a really
nice highlight going on here because
this look is quite matte
I also just highlight the middle of my
face and down my nose sometimes I just
use my finger as well to get genuinely
right high light and there's also a
pinky color which I'm going to use
lightly for just a top to blush not much
so I've kind of gone off blush now you
guys tell me off now moving on to my
lips this was the key thing that
everybody wanted to know the color I use
is called Dominique it is from NARS and
this is kind of like a cool purple
purple lip tone now I can't wear this
color on this its own and I need to
learn - and everything to make it work
for my skin tone but it pops off okay it
pops off when it's on I really like it
it's really cold and quite icy but it is
beautiful and now I don't wear it like
this okay so I go ahead and I add a
night moth which is from Mac on top of
that
and I just draw my lips and then I just
draw it all the way in
okay the keeping I'd do is just keep
blending it in mixing it up until it
kind of gets it in the harsh line and
all blends into a color that kind of
looked like this so guys that is my
finish signature glamorous look it was
highly requested on my snapchat and on
my Instagram and the photo did so well I
was like old people really liked this
and I was generally making an effort to
kind of change up my makeup so I hope
you guys enjoyed that and it was easy to
follow through and I want to share with
you their practical tips I'm genuine
your piont and actually seeing such a
difference in my makeup now this is real
heavy because I have gone from Patricia
bright so Patricia Brad to some
completely different and so I wouldn't
do it all the time because you can end
up just not really realizing who you
actually are but it's nice to see a
transformation so guys thank you for
watching and I'll catch you guys later
bye hey guys welcome to my channel today
