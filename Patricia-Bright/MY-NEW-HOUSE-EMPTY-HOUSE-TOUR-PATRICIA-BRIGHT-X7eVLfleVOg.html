like Trisha Paytas because Linda about
that compensation would be guide
projector I'm going to do a hopeful for
use and as two minds about this
insidious because of the speech occur at
the story by two magnitudes sometimes
holes and that kind of stuff can come up
accorded a bit showing of me and also
just a bit energy sometimes but you know
I thought right I said how many of my
journeys describe and you know see need
to the lawyers and the up and you know
I've been on a trajectory package really
really you know positive and I have a
lot of people to thank that you know
you've gotta see when I was staying in
shared accommodation and me Michael just
got Mary sharing bathrooms and kitchens
with other nurses and doctors you've
seen a foot I'll share the innocence is
right on mums how like people think that
things just happen does just
happen like everything is a process in
the journey and it takes time and this
is our second home that we have walked
to give up and out of the light
it's not even easy in the struggle is
very rules very complicated he takes a
lot of time takes a lot of saving and
discipline and focus but yet
but you know I don't want to kinda show
you of the asshole rather I share my
journey and healthcare can be a bit of a
inspiration to those goals
so you don't necessarily think that
certain things are possible for them
right now they are but they are up there
possible for everyone
you might have to grind harder and
harder than some but their work is like
everybody has the opportunity to build
something which create something what's
happening to have a good career you have
the opportunity for the property to kind
of take it but yes
you know sometimes working come close
very cheap I just as it is not keep my
mouth closed right now I'm very happy
with what God has provided for me and
you know I'm just grateful
okay I think that's it announcer let's
get through this okay this is bruised
knuckles one and this is kind of likely
see I don't live in green like it was
thought that out in the room and this is
here it's anything anything can see
right now what we have about it really
is number one of course the party store
in it's a little bit yellow work because
of the barnacles on it but with a negate
and with and then we're going to get ice
water and racing and then cool great
everything we have a fireplace sly
plating selenium like the center of the
home and the big high responders gas
prices which I have prefer and of the
main window as well that windows would
be to be priority yes and you can see
the huge area because of the lack of
furniture okay so next we are going into
a must it works
favorite part of the house which is
obviously the kitchen and during an area
the go through this before like they
killed it they did an
using job in here and so you can take
quite a bridge London home and make it
phenomenal I think I said this is the
kitchen if you're doing the chin area
and we spend the majority of hiding it
because guess what food if you like and
yeah it makes me happy
really nice a kitchen area I mean is
reduced so I'm a cooker and there isn't
four ovens which and a lot of people say
like you've got four of them actually
got a microwave a steam oven a new ovens
so just kind of that - Rihanna India
it's a bit ridiculous and then there is
like two fridges but everything that's
integrated in the kitchen so it actually
just looks really seamless think it's
really nice matching my fridge is quite
tidy
I have not cleared up for you guys I
kind of like milk right so there's worry
about containers and stuff in the fridge
we get y'all get it right
so there's a big island but working for
AR for when I'm cooking I can watch TV
as well and everything's much hidden so
like you don't have to feel the dirt and
mint you can kind of stake Heidi and
then over here what we have is more like
the chill-out area
so what we're lacking right now or we
want to get are some barstools across
here and then we're going to get like an
l-shaped sofa and this is that Pete
supposedly had in our other living room
and it actually looks so small here
because of the side seams just got
folding doors right towards the hold of
the back cannot wait for summer it's
about 30 Valley 15 times
so all my friends and family
and when you open the door that it's
basically like having the outside inside
I'll patch it alright so this is the
other side of the kitchen dining
chill-out area this is kind of the
break-up zone this is where we have
dinner if we're trying to be good and
having dinner at a dinner table the
lights be left here and it flows through
to a second living room area which I see
is our main area but we'll go in there
in a second alright so over here we have
more lights of snug area
it's like a warm chocolate brown which I
would have never done I'm glad that
people here did it before and again I
will see but this is where we are
chilling like at the end of the day of
the growth has got her collection of
toys in the corner here just the stuff
that she pleases downstairs outside of
her room and then we're going to get
like a proper chest pain about a proper
toy chest but you know what we
understand that this room can get messy
it can meet eyes everywhere and we can
just pack it up at the end of the day
and then yeah picture here is my
favorite we pick this up on trip to Hong
Kong this is going to save me forever it
makes me very happy
so okay guys upstairs we have Mia
Michaels bedroom where we sleep where
you say I'm not sure in that room I also
had Grace's room which is a little
nursery again I'm not showing that room
because I might do like a nursery room
tour one day when I've done it it was
actually how I wanted to be done but
this is where I do my filming it is not
ready yet and get a new changing the
floor changing up the furniture a little
bit but this is what the space currently
looks like this is my kind of drawers
that you see most behind me which has
basically got my like underwear having
it house clothing like stuff like this
that I wear just when I'm cheating at
home and I put like my magazine do
picture frame because I love love love
Jenny oh it's amazing so affordable it's
crazy I'll link them in the description
bar below really really good and then I
have these two drawers so this set have
covered here and a lot of people I think
wherever the water from I believe that I
hate closet but the people who need it
before and simply has them like fitted
into the alcove and then I've got
another set on that side as well I also
have like a dressing getting ready area
this is not done like our Beauty room
should be done I'd love it to me but I
haven't got time for it yet I am going
to do it I just need to like stop going
furniture shopping and findings and
pieces I really really like to kind of
do this place as I want Isaac here
this is like like nope there's no shame
in that which game this is like my wig
head area and then some of my
achievement area view
so yeah this is my life achievement wall
and then like hold on this is so when I
reached a hundred thousand subscribers

few traitors at homeless and astonishing
100,000 people and subscribe to your

six digit milestone each and every
person has subscribed to your channel

way off right now

there might be another five years or so
before I received my might million
subscribers thing well I'm really
grateful

kind of remind me that you know I'm kind
of doing stuff and I'm doing alright
yeah anyways sorry change of subject
so this is my current dressing area this
is not what I want here a lot of people
ask me about this this is from arbok
it's really good for like movability but
eventually that's the kind of couple so
I need something a bit more sturdy from
say yes and then over
here is my cupboard which actually my
clothing is really organized correct
organized it but I want to show you my
secret mess
this is my like secret makeup routine
like oh my god oh my god
but I'm very not happy with this this is
not how I want it to be in any way shape
or form I'm going to have this changed

monitors and all of this as well so yeah
okay guys so that is the end of this
house tour I'm not showing everything
like Gracie's room me in Michael's room
I just wanted to share the bits where I
spend the most time in or will do and
this room isn't even where I want it to
be but it's a big space is so big so I
can't wait to like make it my own it was
a spare bedroom that I've kind of taken
for that filming and working but it's
not that so everyone has their own
little space but yet that is the home
tour I really hope that you like paint a
