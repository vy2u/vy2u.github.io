big they were they were just like what
are these they were huge
hey guys I am back and better I took a
little bit of a break at the end of the
year and just took two weeks is like a
break from e on YouTube and stuff but it
was amazing I went on holiday I been
with my family I've had an amazing New
Year's I haven't asked my winners on my
snapchat but I have it down below but
you know what I am feeling refreshed and
new and I feel like I've got a new lease
of life so so much is coming and one of
the things I was saying like for this
year is that I'm just gonna be I'm just
gonna do me and I'm gonna just be more
like a slightly more in your face but
just wear my heart on my sleeve a little
bit more because when I first started
youtube I was like never ever look like
like I was that kind of person and I am
that kind of person and sometimes I need
to kind of bring it all back in but then
I got really like serious and really
like not serious but kind of closed up
and I said you know I don't talk about
anything that's controversial - in the
opinions flying out someone's gonna have
something to say and actually it's just
going to irritate me however you know
what that is life people are gonna have
something to say about something and
you've just got to deal with it so that
is a headspace I'm in and I wanted just
to have a frank chat about this topic
which is cosmetic surgery people we're
going to talk about it now those of you
who don't know I've had cosmetic surgery
plastic fantastic and I had I'm going to
go through all my cosmetic surgeries and
in this video and then kind of talk
about it but before I get started I have
had these thoughts like swirling around
my head for quite a while I felt a
little bit weirded out but I really felt
like I really didn't want to do this
video because people could get all up in
arms there's so many girls who have
their knickers in a twist I should point
like a trigger warning like warning
warning
if you are one of these people going to
get your knickers in a twist about this
then this is not the video for you kind
of came to this realization that people
aren't really mad at some surgeries but
they get mad at other surgeries so say
if someone gets a lazy eye fixed no
one's got a problem with it someone gets
their like jaw aligned right because
they've got an underbite someone gets
their ear piece someone gets tattoos
nobody gets up and arms about that but
people get up in arms when a woman does
a surgery that appears to make them more
physically attractive in you know a
mainstream sense so boobs or or nose
jobs or lip jobs or waist jobs or that
kind of thing so such thing as a waist
up and I think I just made that up
but that kind of thing like people get
really up in arms about it and when you
realize that there's a lot of surgeries
that are done that are cosmetic but no
one has a problem with one of the
questions I had for you guys is why do
you think people get so why they are so
emotionally connected to when another
woman decides that they want to make
themselves look more maybe sexy you're
physically attractive and the other
thing is that when I had some cosmetic
surgery and a lot of people I got a lot
of backlash people saying you know you
don't love yourself you can't talk about
self-love if you had cosmetic surgery
and I got quite upset by it and that is
actually one of the reasons where I got
a bit more courage was that this concept
that if you want to change your physical
appearance or if you change a physical
appearance you're not confident now do
you guys agree with this idea that if
someone changes something about their
physical it means that their uncut deep
down their unconfident and for me I felt
like my confidence came from my
experience and the things that I've been
through and overcome and had nothing to
do with realistically my physical
appearance and obviously that thing all
those are things about our physical
appearance a lot of us want to change
some of us do something about of it some
of us don't however what you guys think
about that do you think that someone who
has cosmetic surgery can't truly be
confident in themselves
I don't know question for you guys
before I get started anyway let's get
straight into it on my snapchat and on
my Twitter I told you guys that I was
to be doing this video the comments came
rolling in oh my gosh II awkward so yeah
I'm gonna answer everything let's go
straight into it
so firstly let me talk about my cosmetic
surgery that's what cosmetic work number
one I've had laser hair removal
I had laser hair removal on my hoo-ha
and on my armpits and prior to having a
baby
amazing I'll do it game cost not that
much expensive I'm looking at 200 pounds
plus plus but it can go up into the
thousands if you have let your whole
body done that kind of thing do I think
it's worth it yes but actually when I
was pregnant I wasn't able to maintain
it and slowly but surely my hair has
started to come back my armpits not so
much but definitely down below my lady
garden is looking a little bit bushier
so would I do it again yes I want to do
it again need a hookup though laser hair
look up hey I'm speaking to you out
there and pain level medium some areas
were more painful than others my second
cosmetic procedure I will say was my
cosmetic dentistry for those of you who
don't know I wore clear braces for just
just about a year and and there was one
reason when I had it done I had this one
tooth that would disappear into it oh
one it was over here I was over here but
this tooth just kept on saying the bride
Patricia and I just didn't like the way
that tooth look every time I smell
smiled like every does you it would just
come out there and so I got clear braces
and the price was Sircar two thousand
pounds in total for all of the braces
that I had which is basically like
Invisalign but not Invisalign is around
2,000 pounds took about a year and
regards to pain like I don't really like
going to the dentist most people don't
the dentist bit doesn't actually hurt
but it's when you put the brace in for
the first two days you're kind of in
quite a bit of pain and afterwards it's
fine and it you know settles back into
place and then yeah I just have to keep
wearing the brace and that was my second
cuz my tit surgery after that for those
of you who don't know
I broke a bone in my hand while I was
pregnant because I was literally the
clumsiest woman ever I don't even know
what happened I tripped I fell like two
or three times and while being pregnant
and I think there's something about your
balance or something you're just so off
scent I was actually crazy but fell and
apti ended up with a fracture on my hand
so when I fractured my hand I went to
the hospital and everything and they
were like we can I can kind of set it
back into place manually and you're fine
with that and it will be fine it'll be
functional and but it might not look so
good and so we can refer you to the
plastics team the cosmetic surgery team
to you know to fix it for you but you
will have to have a surgery and go under
them and set it to do that and actually
now that I look back on it this is a
cosmetic surgery I didn't have to have
this surgery because my hand would have
been functional but it would have been
ugly and I didn't want that so I went
under the knife and to have this surgery
done and you guys might remember I was
wearing like a cast for ages and
basically I had two pins inserted into
my hand they crossed over to straighten
up my finger and maintain my bone and it
is more or less than saying my hands are
not pretty anyway so I didn't need any
extra stuff to make them even uglier
that makes any sense but yeah so I had
to what to like wires put in and they
were in there for six weeks after the
surgery I was like yes this is fun I can
do this yes so easy easy peasy simple
pimple until like the anesthetic wore
off and I was in the most agony I've
ever been in pain level nine pain level
nine it was so painful I had to get it
out what Michael had to drive me to the
hospital a and E I was that crazy woman
in A&amp;amp;E like rolling on the floor in
agony I was like pain killers clean I
was desperate definitely but I could
have taken paracetamol ibuprofen how to
get morphine how to get really strong
pain medication any regrets um
no regrets no good but at the time I was
right I should have just left it I
should have just left it really hurt
so my final procedure that I know is the
big one which I got lots of questions
about which is me having cosmetic
surgery on my boobs yes guys I have had
a boob job or breast augmentation as it
is officially called and I had a breast
augmentation two and a half two and a
half years ago it might have even been
up to three years ago I think it was
2013 and I really didn't talk about it
because um I think people noticed
put an Instagram up people went buck
wild wild about it and I was like oh my
gosh delete that post that could never
even happen never mention it again until
last year and what I had I had silicone
implant in size 310 and they are high
profile the reason I have high-profile
implant is because I have a very narrow
chest and that is what the doctor
recommended for myself I saw three
different surgeons and and picked one
one of the segments that I saw he looked
like he was so tired and like he it was
just like you know conveyor belt of
people getting breast jobs with him and
he looked jaded and I was like you know
what I he ain't about to be my surgeon
there's one section who I saw who was
happy he was a private surgeon happy
chappy happy-go-lucky he was good smiley
smiley he told me every third nipple
because I have a little mole but he's
actually starting more with the third
nipple so wow that's really quite it
know that he was really good and
actually I should have gone with him but
I didn't reason I didn't go with him is
because he said the maximum um cc's he
would give me was 270 he said he didn't
think any larger would suit me and and
he thinks that's 270 would be good on my
profile however me being the big head
and oh I know it all because I've been
on certain websites like real self and
no I need four hundred CCS so I think go
thing because he was like I'm not going
to go any bigger and I said if I'm
get boobs I won't notice any bigger and
then I was another surgeon like my
target was 400cc
and he has like nope you're not going to
get that because you're just not my
body's not big enough to get that side
and so I ended up with 310 and boy am I
glad that I ended up with 310 and to be
honest I should have gone with the
original guy and gotten a bit smaller
because actually I do feel like my boobs
are slightly bit but I'm going to talk
about that later
so yeah so went with the other surgeon
he was good it was a really good : ik it
was one of the bigger clinics but it was
a private surgeon in the bigger clinic
if that makes any sense and I had the
surgery it was super nervous but super
excited and Michael was with me and he
like lost all the color in his face he
really really didn't like the idea of me
having surgery but I'm one of these
people that I'm when I'm determined to
do something I'm just gonna do it and I
need to just kind of jump all in or like
go hard or go home
so yeah I got marked up and everything I
might have some pictures of where I got
marked up which is basically they use my
pen to like draw and then basically I
went under let me tell you that I feel
like the surgery was about 10 10 seconds
but the surgery's at you it was for my
surgery was around 45 minutes so it's
not a long surgery and for a boob job
I went very simply I decided to get an
incision under my muscle so under my
boob because I don't mind small scars
they're probably about that big and
they're not very visible and I am dark
skin so it thought it is a bit darker
but honestly it's nothing bad and you
can't see on this I was tonight be lying
if I was doing a handstand joint you
would see them but my boobs cover the
mark that makes it he said I had my
implants under the muscle because I
wanted to be able to breastfeed and I
didn't want to do anything that was
going to impact my nipples and nipple
sensation and my milk so that's the
reason why I chose to go under the
muscle it's got a slightly longer
recovery time and also slightly more
painful came out the surgery
I'm on all kinds of
you know medications while I'm on
painkillers so I'm good and thumbs up
and well get home I'm good I meant yeah
this is fine this wasn't easy until
anesthetic in everything not all the way
off earning a right ah literally hurt so
badly so badly and you know what it's
not a right pain at the incision I'm
only hit like that the incision doesn't
hurt what actually hurt is the muscle
pain so what it is it feels like you've
been doing the most amount of reps in
the entire world and then your muscles I
like was stretch but it's so stretching
my skin was stretch and also my arms
hurt and my arms hurt because of the
kind of muscle area so but the only
medicine man actually needed was
paracetamol and ibuprofen and that
helped I didn't need like anything major
in regards to pain and I'll say that the
pain lasted like quite badly for two
days and I kinda had to sleep like
sitting up but that was for about two
days and I cut that literally couldn't
use my arms they was so weak because Ana
notes the way the muscles are connected
so for about two days I was in but pain
by day three I think I was feeling a bit
more normal by day four I was filming
videos again so I remember feeling like
nothing about it and I'm you know what
I'm not trying to tell anybody did you
do this I was like man this really isn't
that painful like it isn't that bad but
yeah I don't think all weeks of
requiring a recovery no it wasn't
anything like that and I think sometimes
people think surgery way to recovery or
whatever like that or no it wasn't it
wasn't like that for me and it the total
healing time is six weeks and it showed
I couldn't do any like videos and says
that oh my gosh if I ran my booter so I
just had to walk steadily you can't run
because you're tryna hello
you can't run because you want the boobs
to kind of stay in their pocket so yeah
you have to be kind of careful of
yourself for like the first six weeks so
everything can set and then after two
weeks I had to go back to the clinic
to basically have everything checked and
let my decisions and see everything and
see how they looked and they were very
very high and tight in the beginning
like as I arm I got and obviously they
look quite swollen and they're kind of
like that but eventually they kind of
drop down and like kind of softened up
as your your muscle loosens so yeah that
is a bit about my cosmetic surgery
experience so three years later they are
which I'll be honest of you and three
years later they're still in there good
there is no pain nothing like that they
feel like they are very much mine I do
do know that I have implants like I can
definitely tell that I have implants but
overcome let's just clean them abreast
now overall they're not something that I
think about on a regular basis I do not
have any pain you know everything went
really well
in regards to my healing and that kind
of stuff and yeah that is um what I had
boot drug wise so I'm gonna actual
questions because I know lots of people
had more specific questions and they
were actually really good so number one
this is from Louisa Muller and what's
your honest opinion on cosmetic surgery
and oh my honest opinion on on cosmetic
surgery
honestly it's girl if you can do it why
not if it's going to make you slightly
happier about the way you look why not
and I know some people gonna hate it and
say I should have different opinion on
it but I don't like duality is that you
can change every little thing but if you
don't deal with things on the inside
it's not going to make you a happier
person overall but if you understand
that it's literally just a physical
change go with it and it's the same way
when people get loads of tattoos and
stuff like that people like oh my gosh
but what is that going to look like when
you're old you know what it's gonna look
like wrinkly tattoos oh well and if you
don't like them it's one of those
experiences you went through
now obviously the thing that I wouldn't
say go and have cosmetic surgery is
willy nilly because there are risks
associated with surgery
and there's risk of everything in life
you just have to use some kind of common
sense however if you may have a problem
or be dealing with some other kind of
self-esteem issue it's not going to be
your answer but if you're relatively
strong enough to know that it's not
going to be the answer to all your
problems do it I actually don't care
that if people want to if someone what
support nodules in their head to look
like a cat that's your business you do
it do what makes you happy okay so this
person said what do you think about men
who say they wouldn't marry someone who
has had plastic surgery by I really then
think about them okay fine don't marry
me if I hadn't cosmetic surgery so Dania
said any regrets or recommendations on
recovery so as I mentioned that my
regret is potentially the size that I
went for a hundred percent I'm very glad
that I had a boob job I like the way my
body looks with boobs and not gonna like
movies are thing I remember always
loving like seeing all my friends boobs
cuz I'm one of those people like I don't
mind what my friends have seen me naked
I've seen them naked my oh you guys have
boobs like you look so good like I
always wanted boob so having boobs is
wonderful and but I think I should have
gone smaller like one of the surgeons
recommended and potentially I would
actually think about going to go and
have a smaller size but it's really not
that deep for me that and
recommendations on recovery I think one
of the key things that people talked
about was arnica which is kind of like
this a natural method of kind of anti
bruising it's like a a herb and lots of
people take that arnica supplement to
help them with healing and to stop
bruising that kind of thing and just to
take it easy and not to move your arms
that is what I remember doing Oh Marcy
said how did you go about doing your
research I did my research very
basically Google Google is your best
friend initially I went through all the
like official sources so things like NHS
code UK let they have stuff on
on breasts breast surgery the different
types of surgeries there are just doing
that general overview or the risk
whatever then I was on YouTube and I was
following quite a few girls journeys on
their breast augmentation journey
so yeah another surgery I would consider
if it's not actually cosmetic but it is
actually on my nose and it's not because
of the way it looks but actually it's
because I have a number of different
things that I have going on on the
inside of my nose that give me all the
trouble in the entire world so I have a
deviated septum which quite a lot of
people have set of one nostril can be
that the other icon I also have like
reoccurring like sinus infections and
stuff that happen and polyps that kind
of thing and it gives me a lot of aggro
and I spend most of my mornings like
basically sneezing like a madwoman and
then just eyes watering constantly my
eyes water all the time is actually
insane because your nose in your eyes is
basically connected I have seen doctors
about this one of the solutions is
actually having surgery and but it is
elective surgery so it would make my
life slightly more comfortable what the
question is whether I would actually
question what question what do it and
actually sometimes if you get you know
something done to the inside of your
nose it can affect the appearance of
your nose which is kind of scary and I
was like well if I choose to have this
surgery because it is a choice I don't
have to and if I chose to have this
surgery it could potentially change the
way my nose looked and there were some
people actually think I pretend like a
friend of mine she had really bad
deviated said to them that kind of stuff
and they ended up having to break her oh
Lord
think thinking about it just makes me
cringe but they ended up having to break
her nose and then uh-oh
scary scary this is why I'm not in a
rush I mind a rush and then she ended up
waking up out of surgery and her nose
was completely different and they like
but it works that's it the surgery I've
always always wanted but doesn't exist
is foot surgery I always wanted smaller
feet so this is from UM ciccolo says hey
hon my question is so if you're too
young to a for cosmetic surgery do you
think it's a good idea to get a credit
loan my face is it all know if you
afford it don't go into debt for
cosmetic surgery it's really not that
deep
because you'll get boobs and you'll be
broke and you'll be crying and looking
at your book boobs as your tears fall on
them it's not necessary no a cans excess
how did you know you were ready I knew
that I was ready because I was not
procrastinating about it as in when I
had decided I was going to do this I
think within six weeks I had had my
surgery done and always wanted a boob
job
always always always but you know
sometimes you think I'd love to do that
I'd love to do that but you don't do it
until something is that you know what I
really want to make a change I really
want to do this and I did it and within
six weeks I had got my consultation I
saw all my surgeons in the space of a
week I booked it in four to three weeks
after that and I did it heavily on at
nine nine five five said would you allow
your daughter to have cosmetic surgery
since you had and you know what this
questions been asked quite a few times I
don't know if it's meant to be in a
shady way or knob no what is achieved
good question I've had cosmetic surgery
would I let my child when she's of age
have cosmetic surgery if she asked me if
she had the money to it should a genuine
reason if she could explain it if I
thought she was in the right place
mentally she wanted to change something
I don't see why not
I know of I've say in school there are
some kids who have big ears and they get
their ears pinned back because
emotionally it's impacting them in a way
that it has a negative effect on their
confidence you know what if my daughter
asked me had reason I felt that she was
making a reasonable decision yes I would
let her do that
so see see Jay calls it I want to know
what your mum and sister said and
thought so
the thing about friends and family when
it comes to cosmetic surgery everyone
will always say what's in my eye
I can see like a black speck on my eye
with okay someone will always say no
don't do that you're perfect as you are
as you are my husband said that he did
not want me to do it once
the center I didn't even mention it to
my mom because try and mention this to
an Africa mum they completely don't
understand so I did my surgery and I was
a Thai hey mum and the thing is is that
I didn't tell my mom because and you
should be worried about the surgery so I
would rather come out come out well and
be like hey mum I've done it and had I
not be bothered by it
now she's not bothered in the slightest
I think she was upset though that I
hadn't mentioned it her my sister was
like don't do it but she let you know
what Patricia it will make you happy go
ahead and eventually that is where my
husband got to did you get your face
done your nose look smaller or is it
that your just stop watch your cards or
ah that is one with Nicole okay Taylor
thank you girl
well now I haven't had anything done to
my face
I'm not adverse to Botox like if I get
some wrinkles at the top I will Botox
that you know prevention is better than
cure
and I don't I don't think my face will
ever need fillers because in my family
we have full of faces like could you
imagine filler in this face like look at
these cheekbones people look at these
cheekbones
I was potentially thinking about getting
this thing called oh no it's basically
Botox or muscle relaxant in your in your
jawline and what it is is that it
basically relaxes the muscles here which
will get gives you a tighter and softer
APRI appearance so it's basically an
injection that relaxes the muscle and
then it kind of Slim's your face down I
was genuinely considering having that
done if I do do that
I will let you guys know you'll be able
to tell I look like really streamlined
hi Patricia I have a lazy eye one is
smaller than the other
I really want to do cosmetic surgery to
fix it but everyone says no to me but
deep down I want one what made you
decide to finally get it done in my case
if I do it'll be very noticeable so the
thing is that everyone will always say
no to not to do something because they
love you
they care about you and I think you are
beautiful just the way you are but
sometimes you know if if you are finding
that it's affecting your confidence you
can either choose not to be bothered by
it or you can choose to do something
about it miss faithful so did it make a
difference to your confidence when will
you need to get them changed it's never
I'm confident in my dressing before but
there are times I put an outfit on and
be like this would look so much better
if I had boobs so the certain things I
wouldn't wear because I didn't have the
boot and I just looked funny so I didn't
wear certain things now there are things
that I wear about all this looks so good
especially now that I had boobs but in
the same breath there's some things that
we're not like this doesn't look good
because my boobs are too big for it I
think that if you have boobs you look
bigger so if you're someone who wants to
look clean having big boobs is not going
to make you look as lean as you might
want to look when will I need to get
them change so I believe that you people
get them change every 10 to 15 years so
I'm aware that I might need to have
these changed this is Sharon from South
Southampton how much work was I willing
to spend for my boob job I think I had a
budget of 6,000 in my mind based on like
googling how much it costs for boob jobs
then that's how much I thought I would
be spending and I had saved up and I had
like a boob job
that fund to basically ensure I could
afford it Mandy had not seen what's my
long-term plans for looking after my
boobs especially with kids are you going
to take them out or leave them in or put
new ones in and she wants to know
because she's had her hers done as well
so they're absolutely fine right now
if something happens that if they
ruptured or if they got captured a
contractor or something like that then I
would have them taken out because I'm at
this place where I'm like you know what
I don't need them to be as big as they
are I potentially would have them taken
out and just put my own fat inside there
I'm so like a fat transfer to my boobs
one thing I really didn't like with my
boobs when I had a baby was that you
know when you have a baby all the milk
comes in and all the hormones my breast
was so almond the dose the bit there was
so big they were they were just like
what are these they were huge they were
huge they was so big they were so heavy
they were so laden Oh like nah
I think about how big my boobs were when
I was like just to the last month of
pregnancy and then when I was
breastfeeding they were just I had milk
just spitting out of their best cambio
yeah like milk everywhere it was just so
bad and I hated that and at that time I
really wanted to have my implants out
glad that your breasts get huge when you
have a baby now you have implant on top
of it but then now they look like they
look really good
do I think that youtubers and social
media stars and reality TV stars
encourage surgery or do you think it's a
personal choice in the end this is a
good question I don't think they
encourage surgery but I think what they
do is they bring awareness to it so I
think there's this awareness that people
are showing that they're been able to
change things about themselves that you
never knew that you could do but it is a
personal choice at the end of the day
but you know what you don't know can't
hurt you so now that people know about
it is up to them to make informed
choices just because you can do every
surgery in the world should you do it
question mark all right guys well that
was kind of Frank wasn't here I Kylian I
hope this video makes it up I don't even
know how or why I did this video and it
was long but I wanted to kind of start
the new year just being as frank as
possible and now it's long so I like
talking huh and this probably will be my
first and last what like chat but if I
had anything else done I will let you
guys know I won't just go and do
something is there anything else oh if I
do that buxom thing if I have any laser
I will let you guys know I'll bring you
on the journey so you can understand it
I think I was going to do something else
actually I think I was going to get no I
don't think it's time for any Botox or
anything yeah I think I'm all right
there and I don't need lip fillers
because check out these bad boys I'm
lucky like that but yeah I will be
really transparent about it and I think
I'm at this stage where I'm just like
you know what it's just it's literally
just physical and it's so and as
somebody asked me like where is it or -
priorities very very very low like
really really low but you know it's one
of these videos one of these things that
people I women like to know about they
want to know about so here we are so
