done one of these what I need to do a
morning routine and show you what I like
to do in the mornings and hopefully I
get this done in just under an hour
so my morning consists of waking up next
to Mohave who's always awake before I am
because he goes to work much earlier
than I do and he always opens up the
windows to let the light in and normally
that is what ends up waking the art as
I'm not so good when it comes to alarms
now of course like everyone asked
I wake up Dazed and Confused and yes I
do spend time on my phone but I usually
like to check some positivity apps the
Bible apt and that kind of thing and
then I'll do a ten-minute scroll on my
social media so my Instagram I'll check
my comments my likes and I kind of
battle between Instagram stories and
snapchat but I love both of them
normally I end up being working up by
this little one who usually makes the
noise and I have to go down and look
after her
so my morning cleansing routine is a lot
more simple than it used to be because I
haven't got time like that but obviously
I've dealt with brushing my teeth then
I'll say that this limit sonic care
toothbrush is the bomb you guys have
heard me talk about it I love it and
then I'm also using the ponds cold cream
hands up if you don't know about this
get to know it's really a classic item
and I bought it in the state and I
partnered with these guys like ages ago
and I thought was the perfect thing for
this time of year it's super
moisturizing but also really gentle when
cleansing I love the way my face feels
after I use it and it just feels really
Julia moisturize after that I just have
that shower so for the day I'm using
lots of mirrored on my face right now
and I just think it's a really good
range and as you can see that is little
grace doing I don't know what you're
doing down there so my lips have been
really dry as well as I've been using a
lot of gos recently and I've been using
the Neutrogena deep moisture on my body
as well so I try and wear a simple
collection of clothing in the morning
this is my like go to rail and I'm just
going to slip on a little bit
the jumper
so when I walk into the kitchen the
first thing I do is make my pet lunch
for the day and if you guys don't know
about love with food that you need to
get to know lovely food is basically a
monthly snack subscription service and
if you guys know I love my food and I
love to snack but these are really cool
because they're all-natural organic
snacks and they basically come to you
every month to your door and you can
find them on Lobby food com2 basically
sign up and if you guys are watching you
can get 25% off your first do LOX pop
using the link in my description bar
below I really like the coconut one I
mean like the gummies and what I find is
that they are the perfect snack
basically for when I'm at work so I have
like a really healthy salad but I also
have like a little healthy snack on the
side as well also for every box that is
sold at least one meal is donated to a
food bank and that is amazing now for my
main lunch I like to keep it really
healthy and I always go for a salad and
I basically chop up anything I can find
my fridge but cucumbers tomatoes and
carrots an avocado on my favorite and so
they always go in with some lettuce some
fresh olive oil and a little bit of pink
Himalayan salt
I also seasoned some salmon and grinnin
and this is basically for today and like
the rest of the week as well pop it on
the grill and that's basically my food
for good while so when it comes to my
breakfast I have to keep it really
simple
obviously I've spent lots of time on my
lunch and stuff but what I normally do
is I will have some kind of granola some
chopped up through and I might even put
a couple of snacks in it as well this is
like a really nice sturdy breakfast I
really like and then it gives me a
little bit of extra time to feed grace
now before I leave I always try to clean
up after myself as much as possible
because there's nothing like coming home
to like a really messy house I will show
my bottles or the plates and stuff so I
have them ready for the evening after
that I pack everything up and I always
have a backpack that I wear to work and
it's so funny how much I used to hate my
backpack but now my backpack is
everything I bought my laptop my snacks
my food it all goes into my backpack and
I basically bounce on my merry way you
guys have probably seen me wearing these
on my social media like all the tiny are
so comfortable these are the Valenti
others but I wear them so much it
totally worth it I close the door get in
the car and I will find myself at the
child minders and mums and then the
officer for the day so guys that is
basically my morning routine QG it's
done in about an hour no not too much
glitz and glam but I'm good
hey guys welcome to my channel so I'm
sure you're looking at me and looking at
my hair and noticing that it looks very</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
