and it's so so good I thought I am a
different type than when the sun is
shining like I'm I know this actually
the sword I think it could be like some
of us just means life but when the
lights out like with you the personality
comes out and it feels very very good
but today I want to go through my big
spring waters with you guys
it's a funny I've been having a massive
clear out of my home and my makeup and
everything I work for my closet and I
did a whole month to clear out of it and
I kind of wanted it to be really spring
I wanted it to spring it be springy
without having to buy those new items
I'm going to show you exactly how I did
that and what I did however stay tuned
because I still bought a few new pieces
for this season if you want to know what
some of the top trends are spraying why
I put my closet and I will showcase so
inside is my comment here and as you can
see it does look quite spring and quite
organized but some time to do it a
couple of weeks ago I basically have a
big old clear out I take out all my six
warm and windy coat and I put them into
plastic boxes and I never throw them
away what I do is I put them in the
sauce because I know that at some point
next year I'm going to wear them again
there's jackets there now three years
old four year old that I just get rid of
and my plastic box is lychees affecting
ever keep them clean and protective and
then I went through my items and really
selected out all the stuff that I
thought was really spring the key things
that I really like are obviously the
colorful stuff my closet actually looks
colorful we've got some yellow going on
and it's funny enough I'm less likely to
be actually wearing this I haven't worn
it here it's more like a yellow mustard
and it's a little bit warm but for when
it's chilly and might be wearing it I
bought this jumper last year and didn't
realize that you know
was going to be really trendy for this
year but I really like it I love the
detail at the back it's misguided piece
and it's really nice just to win out
with Sun and jeans and then I have my
little blue section the pink so trendy
love it and this top is new this is the
top that I think people have seen you
wearing
so mark thanks so much I've been wearing
it all over Instagram and I think my
next video I might be wearing is that
I've already worn it I love this top
both on and off that the comment is very
flexible e-even I'm not going to any
festivals on a look like I am and then I
have this structure this is bizarre a
jacket I think it's back in stores
bought it last year again but it was
only about 30 pounds but I think I
brought it back more expensive it's
crazy but I just love the brightness the
color is very pretty
another trend for spring is denim and I
have denim ok who doesn't have denim I
feel like makes a lot of denim as well
as to denim jacket.this is about 2 or 3
years old this is actually old school
nearby I still wear it
the style isn't perfect for this season
but throw off my shoulders and I look
like Kim Kardashian it's all good and
then I have this one from River Island
from a couple of months ago as well and
I love that says this isn't my first
rodeo and then next thing next trend
pink for lashes love it jumpers they're
all so I don't have to buy new items
just because they are on trend go
through do you have a king joffrey if I
do I will be wearing it like it's news I
love it and then this top is a new this
is from River Island and the nipple
still on there I have worn it once so
many people are asking me about this
immense napture mesh black blush really
in I love mesh as well but yet its
essence recall and then this is just
like my wife's picture now my white
sections a little bit developer I always
wear white all the time
whatever I've got another closet wake up
the more like not those fashionable
stuff the wall at the everyday item and
then leather jackets and you guys have
seen my Balmain I got my tag on that
handle which is the bow main hangar
I mean to me this to me just assumed
life it probably it is the most
expensive item in focus closet but I
feel like it's difficult
and I think it is what's really
flattening on and then all the rest of
these are again in the older pieces I've
got you know my beige is my life jacket
by camel jacket this I've had for like
three years
it's a Topshop and I feel like I wear it
every season
once the workmen start cooling it down I
just love the way this is it's so soft
and the older it gets the nicer get a
heart but that this is new and this is
victory motive to discuss it's from
Ridgid from misguided I thought was
really nice and although it's black and
for Paris from the bicyclist you'll be
really nice and then I have one of my
leather jacket so I have a lot of
leather jackets I mean I had too many
and I think I've sold some onesie pop
and against onto my sister's but I
really like that you only need one
maximum to another jacket like you don't
need so many oh and you guys remember
this as a stretch it it's literally the
best fitting jacket so oversized
and fun making sure happy family weave
around clown shoes and stuff are really
trendy for the season absolutely oh wait
bands on an everyday basis but literally
everything I'll just put some bad or the
converse is or some Stan Smith and
something but I what would be nice oh I
have a collection to inspire me maybe if
I want to get a bit more dressed up this
is my muse
State Oregon this is my one of two bags
for the year and I need love love love
describes it is very very pretty very
seasonal but all my bags are black so I
wanted to buy a bag that wasn't bad and
then I have my stance next either an
older style
I still wear them they stay relatively
clean and tidy which I like so these
also from Reebok these watching you and
they watch sense to me on the team so
they've got these neat colors and stuff
which are what women really nice Bob
excited I did buy the large piano
trainers they're really pretty ever a
lot of people ask me where I got these
from I have the link down below yellow
shoes these are old these are from
perfect all of them they're from last
summer and these are some hostage and I
think that they're really nice with this
time runs event or special occasion or
I'm going out and I wanna wear skinny
jeans and heels and I wear these and
this is Martin Gucci bag I was actually
going to sell this bag but then I really
liked it again I picked up on like no
this is really trending and all the
colors really nice it pops and I think
it's not as a bag that isn't all black
so yeah and then these bad boys are oh
my god
these are new from Ecuador I had to I
actually had to write all these online
and they just had me so inspired love
the blue of the black and white stripes
just everything about it screams me okay
so this drawer is my accessory drawer
and why realize is that I don't actually
have that much jewelry but I don't like
wearing jewelry I'm a chemical I live so
many items I take households on I just
over realized he raspberry wear rings
because I feel like I have the ugliest
hands in the world so we just got me the
draw more attention to them so funny
enough I just have like all my life
cheapy chokers and stuff which actually
like these are from khartoum and where
they're from if it's on next it is
actually gorgeous it is really pretty
and then actually I do like my so much
if you guys have been seeing we wear
disease really same thing
cause if you they are from the so marks
then I have almost got it again um I do
like my designers office I have the old
deal and I was inspired when I saw
beyond aware and Emma have to have them
have a lot of great bands as well and
the names for this theme of season
coloured glasses are with your friends
these are from Ray Bans Pete lenses so
many people ask me about them pick them
up on easels and I just think they look
amazing
it's another trend yellow sunglasses I
lost 12 pounds really nice I have them
linked down below I did pick the key
Australia and Desmond cuttings
collaboration and I thought they just
look so bad I'm a big fan of busy when I
see her I'm searching I'm like oh my god
Gold and then I have my best tip I don't
have that many belts Azoff vintage
vintage and Urban Outfitters and then I
did buy one of those Corvette belts but
this one's really good quality I love
the way the middle of it looks it's from
River Island and I noticed there's
definitely a hot trend that will
probably like fall out - and really
quickly because I remember when we were
young your way or way sprouts and then
they got really corny very quickly but
what this always really nice and then
over here I have my jeans and for spring
jeans the trend is to be light and
bright like so more vintage wash so most
of my indigo and dark or darker jeans I
have popped away but as well just be
nicer to keep out all my mom jeans these
are like a favorite pair these are from
American Apparel these are like the best
quality jeans ever is so good I've had
these about four years and they're just
so hard that proper denim but I think I
went back to go buy jeans again and they
will show that quality no wonder they're
going back and then I have just my
Topshop jeans which I think you guys
will recently read on you and then my
favorite place
the jeans or my favorite style jeans are
from River Island particularly a pair
called the Amelia they're really nice a
really skinny also the jeans that have a
little bit of something-something these
are from H&amp;amp;M they're not that skinny
fitting which are quite liked and they
have that really nice denim denim knee
patch detail
ain't nobody getting rid of black
trousers or black jeans so my remains a
single part of my wardrobe basically on
one pair these are my River Island
Amelia best slide ever and though these
Ron these are from Avis as well look
love I love it when they have this under
the knee at my favorite styles and then
I have this faux leather pair also from
H&amp;amp;M and look at the knee detail I love
it but sometimes this makes my legs look
so thick and chunky right when you were
shining on your legs
listen it can add about 10 pounds I
think you have to be careful once white
jeans because sometimes they can look
very tacky I actually bought these again
these are New River Island but I bought
them because I didn't want any risk
teacher I have so many rip detail jeans
somedays let G be normal so down here
destroyed virtually empty it is for just
casual items so just that stuff I want
to throw on that is room for a little
more stuff if necessary okay so over
here is my other my other closet and
this is where I keep the stuff that just
basically is this so it doesn't matter
but it's the fat lady love
like black bear basics that loads of X
and stuff here
a three or four bit and then about odd
you know at seasonal but I genuinely
enjoy wearing that t-shirts and all
stuff that I'm not gonna wear all the
time so like look at this like I bought
this on days off I like it but how am I
going to wear
not that regularly and then I drop that
less a bit more props and stuff you know
walking down London streets wearing a
crop top and just a couple of sweaters
I'm hoping I don't have to wear them
right now I want this phone to keep
shiny I want to keep my show on us out
but you never know and then they're more
chances more jumpers and then my wife
start the bet she's wearing that of
white I mean I don't know what to wear I
just put on a white top especially if
it's off the shoulder so I have a number
of those this one is from glamorous
another one remember I learned one
regards and embarrassed and this one is
a favorite of mine as well which are
born hazel it I just have long stretches
summer dresses and a jumpsuit and in
that place appear I hope things are like
shiny like my birthday dress or this
dress here these are coming on stuff
that I'm not gonna wear a regular basis
and actually a lot of people choose to
fold and vacuum stuff like this away
obviously I've got a bit of room so I'm
not doing that but yeah that even is
like little mini dresses if that's
Parisi or at the bottom it's not going
to get much wear so it can just stay
there okay guys at the end of my
wardrobe overview I hope they gave you
that visit inspiration and fun for you
no matter what you have or don't have
and yeah I will see you in my next video
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
