on achieving smooth and poreless skin
and for those who have been watching me
for long enough know that that has
always been my skin gripe I always want
to have the perfectly smooth skin and
it's really hard to achieve perfect skin
but you can definitely get there if you
work on your skin care regime which I
definitely try to do now for me I have
really large pores on my nose I always
have and there are times and they're
significantly worse and times where
they're minimized when I'm really really
good with my regime so I'm going to tell
you what I do to basically achieve that
first incisive pause a lot of the thing
is pores are actually natural and you
meant to have pores your skin has them
naturally but some of us have ones that
are larger than others and ones that
regularly can get clogged up and filled
up and I have these on my nose and they
actually could sebaceous filaments so
even when you try to like extract them
they still will fill up like the day
after and you can only really work on
just trying to make them a little bit
smaller so that's what I do
so for those of us who have large pores
or oily skin you know that you have to
keep your skin really really cleanse
however you want to be really careful
that you don't cleanse your skin so much
that you actually end up drying your
skin up because when you dry your skin
up you're just going to have larger
pores dry skin and you're going to
produce even more oil so you really
really need to be gentle now to get rid
of pores the first thing I say that you
need are one or two products it's either
a H J's will be a chase which are
basically acids that exfoliate the skin
and these can be firm naturally but but
don't bother with the natural way so
finally there are much better ways out
there and things such as salicylic acid
which you find in anti acne products and
also glycolic acid now for me I don't
have acne and I but I do have large
pores and I find that glycolic acid is
my favorite way to cleanse my skin and I
use the skin the facial exfoliating
cleanser for normal skin and it's a
gentle creamy cleanser but it contains
probably about three to four percent
glycolic acid and when you use it you'll
find that literally you can
your face looks glowy up because what it
does is it breaks down the like the lip
the lipid bond so the oily bones of your
dead skin themselves and it helps to
resurface them now I probably do that I
use this probably every other day and
with anything with skin problems never
overdo it never try to do it like every
day twice a day that you're just going
to exacerbate any skin problem that you
have so on the off days I use a gentle
skin cleanser and I am using the
Cetaphil at the moment which I think
it's okay it's alright it just doesn't
give me much but I think it's nice and
gentle when combined with this and this
is very very creamy so again I think
when it comes to really-really
exfoliating the skin you can use
Luther's or you can use like different
kind of manual exfoliation but I find
that I don't like using like scrubs to
clear the skin and actually you end up
kind of scratching your skin and
actually chemical exfoliation is
probably better in my opinion and manual
exfoliation you can then give yourself a
deep cleanse clay masks are really
really great at just pulling out the
impurities and the oils and like the
things that clog your pores so when
you've cleansed or exfoliated in with an
acid or belief or whatever you use to
exfoliate go ahead and use a mask I love
the body shop warming mineral mask self
warming deep cleansing clay treatments
this stuff is the bomb like I love it
and your skin feels so so cleanse
afterwards now after you've kind of done
something like that like a face most
like that what you really want to do is
to now kind of nourish your skin again
the one thing that I really like you
is vitamin C vitamin C serum I've
mentioned this many many times I've
always used the term mushy it's great if
you want to brighten your skin as well
and it protects your skin from free
radicals and stuff like that
I do use the one from the body shop it's
probably one of the best vitamin C
sounds that you can buy on the high
street or you can get like ones where
you make your own vitamin C so because
the thing about vitamin C is that it
actually doesn't last for very long and
it's not very potent for very long and
even with this serum it's ten days you
use it and probably isn't as active
after 10 days so after that I probably
lay my skin with the deep moisturizer I
sometimes use the kills ultra facial
cream a technique we have lots of
different moisturizers that I like to
use I like to keep these ones that are
quite gentle but my favorite thing to
use is an oil
I love night whirls I like the kills
midnight recovery oil I like the body
shop for 2min e oil I like coconut oil
I like olive oil because even if I have
oily skin actually using oil in your
face will really help to rebalance it
you think that it makes you earlier it
really doesn't and it is really good for
your skin now I bet if you did that
regularly you genuinely start seeing a
difference in your skin the key thing
that I really feel that makes the
difference in skin is the aah A's or the
glycolic acid it really does work like
you will not believe and if you're
someone who's got really extreme skin
problems then you can always go and get
a skin peel people do do them home I
wouldn't recommend doing them at home
I'll probably just go to dermatologist
to get them done but it can be quite
pricey some guys I think that is it and
I'd say that this is a journey that I've
been on for years and actually when I
physically seen my skin changing and
improving I have to share what I use and
what works and a lot of it is that
science base as well I'm not just a
product junkie I tried to work out what
actually works because there's a lot of
stuff on the market that tells you it
does this it doesn't do anything it
doesn't actually contain any of the
things that are actually gonna help you
so I try and test this stuff and
if my skin issue number one my skin
issue number two is hyperpigmentation
and I'm going to hopefully do a video on
how I am going to be dealing with that
or how I do you deal with that
so I hope you guys like that and I think
that's it
so guys I really hoped you enjoyed if
you did please do give it a thumbs up
and if there any other skin problems or
tutorials that you want information on
then let me know and I will get them in
the pipeline to do so guys I'll see you
guys later bye
so guys in the description box I will
have been outlining every product and on
my blog I will have my whole brain genes
kind of listed out over in detail</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
