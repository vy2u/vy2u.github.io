look kind of rough right now I am
feeling so relaxed and so talk about
just on my pamper routine and I wanted
to share with you a pamper meeting which
I do to kind of deal with all the body
issues that I have with that I don't
like so much such as certainly like
stretch marks and KP chicken skin you
guys know about that I talked about a
lot I thought it would just be nice to
share with you my routine my body
routine I've also got the most amazing
new spot the world kit from the body
shop I've seen lots of these videos that
I've been waiting to receive mine and
show you some of the goodies in it it's
inspired by sports all across the world
and the products are amazing but I'm
going to show you everything I do in
this routine super easy to do and
hopefully you should be able to find
everything online I'll link it in the
description bar below and as mentioned
I'll be uploading on Tuesdays Thursdays
Sundays between 6 &amp;amp; 7 p.m. so put it in
your Diaries
Patricia Brett is back bye guys so guys
the first step is the preparation and
usually that's when I come in from work
or wherever I've been for the day and
get comfortable
after that it's the kitchen items if you
didn't know you can find some amazing
things that can work on lots of
different body issues coffee is an
amazing natural way to treat cellulite
and lemon is also great for stretch
marks so if you can cut up and find the
lemon these are really good ways to
naturally treat some of those problem
areas so for me I get comfortable and I
usually do this in the shower because I
need to just rinse everything off my
stretch marks are behind my knees of my
broad cheeks
and just other places lemon is great for
kind of evening out the skin tone as you
guys know that you can rinse it off and
then coffee is also great if you can
make it into a paste with some sugar and
some water if you rub that onto your
cellulite areas for me mine again is
definitely the back of my thighs and my
butt again and butt rub that in leave it
on for like you know 5-10 minutes and
rinse it off for some reason it work I
don't know how but it's well known so
after that I'm going to use my expired
the world set from the body shop and I'm
going to firstly use the Moroccan body
clay this is amazing and it kind of
feels like it makes your body go like
nice and hard and everybody wants a firm
skin and again this is just a treatment
that I'll do say once a week you can see
it goes quite hard and then you rinse it
off
now I can start my actual pampering that
isn't so messy and I start off with my
normal cleansing routine and then I go
ahead and try using a face mask I really
like these paper face masks I first got
one when I was in Hong Kong and I've got
this one from indeed and it's just
really nice and moisturizing I put that
on before running a bar and then
basically it's time to chill out so I
like to soak up and I'm going to use a
body scrub this is the African examinee
I'll scrub this is a nice coarse scrub
which is really good for like my elbows
this is where I have KP and some like
rough textured skin so I love a scrub as
well as a body brush and when I do scrub
and like body brush when I jump out of
the bath I feel so soft my face also
ends up feeling lovely and moisturized
and treated
so my next step is to moisturize I'm
using a black ting
it contains lactic acid and I bought
this on Amazon I don't believe you can
get in stores here but I've heard it's
amazing for those little dots or KP /
chicken skin because it contains lactic
acid which can break the skin down and
then I'm moisturizing with this Hawaiian
cream also from the body shops by the
world it's super thick and super
moisturizing like it's like my next
layer I think it's lovely to lay out
moisturizers finally I'm following up
with a body oil and I think it's just
like moisturizing the ceiling like you
might do with your hair it just sells
all of that moisture in you can use on
your hair keys and your face you can use
it all over and I love just being all
shiny and moisturized so guys that is
basically my pampering and smooth body
regime I hope you guys like that and
gave you some ideas I shall see you on
Thursday so happy pampering bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
