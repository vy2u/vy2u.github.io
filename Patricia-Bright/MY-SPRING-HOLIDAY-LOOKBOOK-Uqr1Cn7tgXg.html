jeans and in effect denim and wire

was in a really silly mood this day
I love how super casual this look is but
paired it with these amazing sandals
from a zorse to just add that touch of
glam I was definitely feeling myself in
this little red dress because it's just
so easy to like put on don't even need a
word bra well you included but it's so
casual and it's actually really
comfortable and it's got some great like
contouring it that just makes your
