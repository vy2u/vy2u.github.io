another weekend where see you guys as I
am enjoying myself in the state I wanted
to share some of the looks that I packed
along with means I hope you guys enjoy
so if you guys don't know I'm definitely
one of those lastminute.com Packers
you'll always find me online buying a
couple of new bits before I go away I
got lots of the items in this look from
very dark owk they have a next day
delivery right Kinect plus service which
is amazing I even got this suitcase on
there and this is my carry-on which I
tried to kind of Pat kind of Knight me
but also any of the other stuff I got
I'll put it all inside there so when I
get to the airport one of my favorite
things to do is to hunt down sweets and
snacks for the flight I hate the way
ears pop and they definitely do help for
my look I keep it casual and I've got
leggings on and this oversized jacket
that keeps you nice and warm when I'm on
the flight because I always get cold
when I'm driving so once I arrived in LA
I was super excited because the Sun was
shining and that makes me so so happy
it's something about having sunshine
that just makes you feel extra good so I
donned on this kind of white caftan with
this cutout detail in the middle which i
think is really nice I have got chops on
underneath and basically so the majority
of my time eaten which is my favorite
pastime if you know me well I'm just
getting snacks and smoothies and just
chilling out you know living that away
myself so this is a really nice casual
look for a day like this
so one of the things that I love to do
when I go away about you to visit a
museum in any country I go to and this
is the LA County Museum of Art it's got
gorgeous outdoor installations and I
love this light one here you have to see
at night if you ever come to LA and I
wore this really gorgeous cutout dress
and nothing needs details in the palm
print is just super feminine and girly
and some days I have my girly days
actually it's quite a lot of the time if
I be honest with you there's some things
that were a bit more bright colors that
no no suitable in this environment
in LA is definitely worth while visiting
the beaches I'm so jealous that I don't
have a beach like this place why this is
in Santa Monica obviously I had some
model on the lifeguard stand is just so
picturesque there and I just wore this
bikini
I love the bikini because it's cut so
really good size and I like the pattern
on them as well they're just wearing it
with a pair of high-waisted shorts but I
don't really like show my stomach all
the time but it's got a gorgeous cross
back as well
additionally the Sun sets on the beach
are amazing everyone comes out it gets
super busy everyone watching the sunset
it is really something worth seeing and
when it gets a bit chilly I just throw
on a t-shirt and just enjoy the moment
you know
you guys know I'm like I'm always
changing up my look gum from shorter
hair for the moment and a super casual
cool look I've got these gorgeous added
s trainers which are super buff I love
these
I just wanted my extra ripped jeans and
my oversized jacket that you guys have
already seen it was kind of chilly in
the morning because you're going to a
farmers market just right by our hotel
so I just thought I'd wear this to go
through the market
so you guys know that I absolutely love
to travel and that's where the majority
of my money goes but there's something
about traveling and just experiencing
new cultures that really does expand
your mind and it is which you feel good
and I've been to America but I've also
been to Asia and Africa and all over the
world and I really do appreciate my
experience in and having the chance to
kind of share it with you so from the
glitz and glamour of Rodeo Drive - you
know villages in Bali I'm very grateful
to be able to kind of do this kind of
stuff and share it with you guys I hope
you enjoy it and I'll catch you later
I'm gonna do a us I'm going to show you
the things I've got because there's so
many nice things out here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
