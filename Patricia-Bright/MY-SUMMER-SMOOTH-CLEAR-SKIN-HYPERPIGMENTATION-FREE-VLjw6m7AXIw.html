beautifully clean smooth and even toned
skin I'm going to show you what I do to
achieve this I don't have to wear heavy
foundations or heavy makeup and I can
enjoy the Sun see the sand this summer
so hope you're doing this in da so a lot
of people suffer from uneven skin tone
and hyperpigmentation so this isn't
Italy where maybe certain areas of the
skin darker and also where you know
we've had acne scars and then leave
marks I still have quite a few but this
is really really really improved
recently and I just want to show you how
I kind of work on my skin to do that so
the first thing that I think is really
important is to exfoliate so exfoliation
kind of just gets rid of that top layer
of dead skin cells and actually kind of
triggers regeneration of the skin and so
that's going to give you a nice new
fresh layer now you don't exfoliate too
much because actually if you have the
opposite effect and makeup skin and very
really good view to invest in actual
exfoliating so on a daily basis what I
would usually do we're just peachy used
with some kind of facial washing pad
this is also from the body shop and it
only cost three pounds if I put my
lotion on it which I'm going to do what
I do is wet it and I put my facial wash
on it really gives you a nice foamy kind
of finish and I don't usually start on a
wet face I can but it does really matter
they can ready to wash it off now after
you wash your face it's always a good
idea T's a nice fresh towel and if you
can have a towel specifically for your
face so sometimes of facial wash is I
would actually use as long as it's a
high-quality facial wash anything be
silent C like acid in it is quite good
but not too much if you have quite dry
skin and also anything with antioxidants
in it it's really good for causing that
cell regeneration and it's going to give
you a smoother more even skin recently I
have started using benefits from
skincare range and I'm actually using
the foaming facial cleanser after you
cleanse your face exfoliate it as I say
use the pilots for later maybe once a
week and stop the one every other day so
you can turn off that but to be honest I
don't actually tow ever because I don't
really feel like I need to if you do go
ahead and use your turban it gets to the
side you really want to end up changing
your moisturizers so a lot more warm
your pores are going to be a lot more
open and you don't want to use something
that is too - and I said I started using
the benefit items and I'm using the
triple performance oil-free moisturizer
now the really important thing to always
consider is to use SP l need your SPF
because the sun's rays are gonna change
your beautiful skin and you don't not
only really teeth and so over here you
can clearly see one decided to kind of
say hello to to pay but um around here
is one very oily so I use up it
completely different on that era
so I use silver shield okay now I have
no idea where you get this one but I
like it it's not actually like a
moisturizer it's like a gel
so I could really clear gel no oil but
this is about 90% my stuff water but it
is very moisturizing and I like you have
very simple performance on my cheeks and
the other areas on my face apply in a
downward smoothing motion one thing I've
only recently started to consider is eye
cream and I'm using that it's potent by
benefit again just throwing your eyes
and it really will give your eyes a
really nice glow if you have bags as
well
it really helps and if you tap it I've
been told it helps with drainage if you
have puffy eyes it will help to get rid
of the water and the excess that's
making it pop so guide but it's my new
updated some on skincare regime I hope
it helps some of you out there so you
can get beautifully even and smooth skin</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
