video is going to be a bit different and
it's actually going to be a few of my
summer stories that i thought i would
share with you you guys have heard my
university story you've heard my growing
up story i think you've had my college
story as well and i thought i'd just
share a few little bits and from my
summers and how they kind of had
influenced my whole life basically and I
can definitely say I was one of these
people who never used to utilize my
summers properly and I'll stay at home
and I know summers round the corner for
a lot of you and I'd stay at home and
watch TV or I play outside just about
like on my road or my front porch and I
just didn't maximize my time and learn
how to do different things and meet new
people because i never knew really knew
what to do during summer but afterwards
i grew up a bit well not that much but I
grow up a little bit and I basically
started to use my summers a lot better
than i've ever used them before and they
really impacted me in a positive way i'm
actually going to be working with NCS
this summer and i'm sure you've got seen
a few other videos from a few other
youtubers as well it's an amazing
opportunity and I'm so glad that I've
been able to say yes to it and me
thinking about my summers and how useful
they were to me I thought something like
this could be absolutely amazing for
some of you I'll go ahead and tell you
guys my summer stories first best summer
number one this is my summer in Italy
this was the summer where I had my first
taste of freedom and I was 11 I was very
much money coddled growing up and not my
mom's fault or anything but she is very
very protective of us and we weren't
really loud out very much working out to
play outside we sat at home a lot and we
would like to see friends and like
family but there was no you're going to
your friend's house for the day or the
evening no none of that so when my mom
agreed to letting us go to Italy by
ourselves for six weeks we were like
crazy kids but
sickly and we got on the plane by
ourselves it was like the first taste of
freedom and I remember thinking that I'm
just going to really utilize this summer
in a positive way and I realized that I
was a big scaredy-cat I was a massive
scaredy-cat because maybe we were
overprotective I didn't know how to ride
a bike I'd never climbed a tree I'd
never done anything like that because I
hadn't had the opportunity and going
there I met my car I knew my cousin but
and my cousin who's a few years younger
than me and this girl was like crazy
like she cuts and bruises everywhere I
had no cuts no princess she used to just
did whatever she wanted have fun riding
a bike should have no pain and she was
like 10 or something like that it was
ridiculous and that summer was the
summer I learned to ride a bike and I
had my first crush when I was out there
and it was absolutely amazing because I
said yes to so many things so riding a
bike crime and trees like and doing
things I'd never done I think we even
did like a performance like a dance
performance for like the town learn just
said like let go a bit and do things I
hadn't done before and at least now I
can feel say I can kind of ride a bike
memorable summer number two was my
internship someone this was the summer
where I luckily enough got onto an
internship at an investment bank and I
cannot believe that I got that
opportunity because I didn't go to the
best university how did good grades but
I hadn't gone to like the best
university in the world and I never
thought I could get an internship at
like this firm whatsoever and somehow I
just decided let me just try let me do
my application then all things work
together really really well I met the
right people I did my application and I
got in i got unanimous only a hundred
and fifty i think was about 150 people
who got onto that internship out of
eight thousand applications so i was
like
I couldn't believe it but I think I was
a bit nervous about it as well so it was
very easy for me to kind of retreat into
my shell and try not to stand out too
much but I decided that it wasn't going
to do that and I decided that I was just
gonna embrace this internship when I got
an offer at the end of the day where I
didn't get an offer at the end of the
day wasn't I didn't really mind that
much I just thought I'm gonna work my
hardest try my hardest and might be the
most the most i could be basically and
luckily at the end of it I actually got
an offer at the end of that internship
by just doing the application and saying
yes to something I never thought I could
actually get be part of and that lets
you changed my life that's a long story
I tell you guys about that in the number
with you but that injures you changed my
life basically and I also say that I met
so many people like people from all
across the world from like the best
scores and different schools and some of
the people that I met I steal my friends
to this day and I was so glad that I was
just exposed to so many different people
so amazing summer number three was my
summer in New York and I spent a month
in New York and again it was just that
freedom I think that's the longest I'd
been away from home ever by myself I'm
actually remember calling my mom crying
like man we were taken such a weasel at
times but and when I got over that I
miss home thing and I really really
embraced my opportunity while I was out
there like I didn't do as much
sightseeing as I should have been doing
because I was having way too much fun
but you guys get the drift and I was
meeting new people and I find that
meeting new people is so important
because these are people that you
actually end up taking with you for the
rest of your life and again some of the
girls that I met in New York a girls who
came to my wedding day like three years
later and it was just a beautiful
experience it was a great way for me to
experience and the cultures I shot a
parties uh yeah
it fairly hard actually but it was great
it was great and I learned so much about
being independent and we're also doing
exams at the time so again I had to
learn how to balance exams and partying
and freedom and everything all together
to make sure that I was successful at
the end of it so amazing someone number
four was my summer in Southeast Asia I
don't know if it's Southeast Asian
actually only say I went to a malaysian
singapore and bali and i remember
thinking how can i go to these places my
friend mentioned it to me and she's
really really brave and she's like she
lives in india right now but then she
was in the North Pole but so she's just
really really random and she's like we
should cook Asian I was like no I don't
want to go to Asia and she's like no
it's really really cool and so I was
like okay if we learn also go to Asia
will go to Asia I stayed in a hostel and
I also was in like a five-star hotel and
it was so weird worlds collide or how
different they are but again I net so
many people I ate the most amount of
food ever and like to my favorite dishes
came from and like my time out there and
I cook them even till today and for
those of you know and massive massive
foodie so traveling and making sure that
you utilize your summer can impact your
entire life in ways that are
undescribable honestly those of you who
have the opportunity to take up
something and do something good over
your summertime that's coming please do
do it because it could change events yet
is the scheme that is providing young
people the opportunity to basically say
yes and that maximize their summers and
NCS are actually hosting in manchester
on the fourth of May and I believe that
there are opportunities to work
backstage and to get some experience if
you want to find out more about NCS in
general what they're doing and the
concert in Manchester are linked
everything in the description bar below
so you can find out a lot more and
hopefully it could be just an
opportunity for you guys to do so
great for summer as well I've shared my
summer stories and opportunities that
I've had and hopefully you'll be able to
share some summer stories with the next
generation complete your me or something
like that and I guys I hope you enjoy
