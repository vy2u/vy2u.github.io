I'm in a different set it's very
different because I'm equal to go what
now I'm still here this is my last mic
and I really felt inspired to just take
a quick intro video and I thought that
we've got July coming up and I really
want to make July a different month so
there's gonna be a summer lookbook in
preparation and coming to July we're
coming into summer and I'm really
feeling inspired and I'm just thinking
about being the best me that I can be
and hopefully sharing that with you guys
as well you guys have been with me on
this journey for so long and I feel that
sometimes like if you know everyone
pursue this party's gonna down and up
and I kind of lost a little bit of
confidence but I realized you know
there's just one you the best thing I
can do is myself the best I can and I
plan to do videos every Sunday and every
Wednesday so make sure you are
subscribed and attuning for those
regular videos but it might be more like
I'm feeling so inspired this so much in
me and I want to share with you guys and
if you want to see more of my holidays
well you can see it on my vlog Channel
and make sure you check out my blog
moments or Starcom because I've got so
many more posts over there anyway I'm
gonna stop babbling and I'm gonna let
you enjoy this summer lookbook so I'll
see you guys later bye
so guys this is my first look and I'm
wearing in the on vest
and I absolutely love neon for the
summer
why because it's flirty it's fun and if
you have darker skin or a great tan it
just really makes you pop
my next look is an easy shift dress I
love a shift dress at the beach because
if you've got a bikini on or whatever
you don't have fat that buttons or
anything you know something that you can
literally throw over your shoulders and
look cute while you're wearing it
so for this look here I'm wearing a pair
of high-waisted shorts
I love shorts for the summer because
they keep your legs nice and cool and I
love the high waist because it makes
your bum look absolutely gorgeous
Oh guys for someone you've got to have
their dress you know I mean as the dress
that makes you feel a hundred percent
like snap your finger amazing gorgeous
and just as feminine as you want this is
my dress and it's from ASOS I absolutely
love it and it's a gorgeous 34 print
that gives me next summer feeling
so this look here is my own white look I
love all white in the summer because
it's so reflective and it means that
you'll be really cool and there's
something that looks super elegant when
you're in an all-white outfit I'm not
the most elegant girl in the world but I
can definitely fake it with this look
so my final look is bodycon I love
bodycon because it makes me feel like a
woman and just really sexy and for
someone you've got to have those days
where you feel like no one can touch you
I've had this dress for free and it's an
absolute favorite of mine
so guys that's my summer lookbook and I
hope you enjoyed make sure you like and
subscribe
and don't forget to check out my blog
moments of style comm I've got a couple
of pictures here from my holiday that
you can enjoy as well see you guys later
