routine video for you guys I want to
share how I get ready my hair my makeup
my outfits my food all that good stuff
now that the summer is here so obviously
I wake up with an annoying alarm clock
trying to get me out of bed I usually
wake up around 7:30 but man Wolsey
once I am finally I kind of have one of
those dizzy moments like where am i but
I'm trying not to grab my phone the
first thing and I'm trying to basically
get out my diary I have one diary which
is full what am i doing for the week and
one diary where I basically write down
some affirmations and I writes down
something like positive thoughts and
stuff I find that this is really good to
kind of send to me and ground me and
also prepare me for the week I love it
so surprise surprise I've finally got
braces and these are the clear braces
kind of like Invisalign
they're quite painful and I got them
probably about a week ago so I'm kind of
getting used to it I'll tell you guys
all about it a little later but I have
to basically brush my teeth and brush
them really really well and then going
on to my skincare routine I really
switched it up or changed up my products
and I'm loving what I'm using at the
moment and this is the Sunday riding
clay cleanser which is just such a
gentle and clarifying cleanser I love
the way my skin feels afterwards
afterwards I usually jump into the
shower give myself a quick wash in the
morning and go ahead and start with my
skincare routine so if you're wondering
that is Michael's back in the background
on my face I'm using Paulo's choice it's
kind of like a pore refining treatment
and I go ahead and use this Sunday
righty good genes it's a nice treatment
that I usually add in the morning and
I'm using Estee Lauder's night repair
eye cream which I do use in a day
because I kind of have X under my arms
and I like to like moisturizer and then
I am using a lovely sunscreen I use a
sunscreen every day and while that all
absorbs in I will go ahead and just get
my outfit ready these jeans are
literally my current waves they're from
Revell clothing I'll link them in the
downbar and I'm just going to find like
a basic top to wear so I'm using the
benefits professional I love the way it
mattifies my face before I go ahead and
apply my Sunday
this is a nice foundation that I
absolutely love it's so pigmented and
very mattifying as well moving on to my
brows I keep it very simple I use Mac's
dip down gel I think using this for a
long time and I don't think I'm gonna
change this method of filling up my
brows I just brush them and use a
concealer from Bobbi Brown to make them
nice and neat but another time I'll do a
proper detailed makeup tutorial I go
ahead and use the double well foundation
from Estee Lauder the concealer is
absolutely amazing and I love the easy
application my eyes I'm loving Matt
right now even though it is summertime
some people love to loss but I'm loving
that and this is the Tarte lip palette
from the Tarte and I just think it's a
really nice matte palette and the colors
are really rich when I kind of apply
them and all this is my new thing
I'm using a white liner or should I say
a peach liner in the inside of my eyes I
just love the way it looks and obviously
I continue with my winged liner look
this is the Tarte liner it is very very
good as well
I might go ahead and use my mascara and
I'm using my lashes which are the lower
lashes these are my favorite lashes ever
I like they're expensive but they're
amazing and I've also finally you know
come on board with the Ben Nye powders I
had them in the past but I never use
them but if I now I'm getting a lot
earlier and these are great for keeping
me nice and that for my blush I'm using
Mac's fever and it's just a really nice
nice ready purpley blush that this looks
great and then my lips I'm using a
lipstick song Sephora
so that is basically my finished look
moving on to my hair I've really been
working and trying to grow out my edges
in the front of my hair that does break
a lot you know well that's the reality
but I really have found that they're
thinking and now I have been using this
grow gorgeous serum which i think is
really really good it's not oily at all
and I just come in to a couple of drops
and blend that in with my fingers and do
a little dance and I pull my hair I had
this is actually the body wave wavy hair
that I was wearing and I straightened it
out and I'm adding other calls back into
it hmm but I really like the cards that
I get with like a large bowel tone this
is from GHD and I'm just kind of doing
these all over and I'm going to brush
them out with my fingers so fingers are
definitely needed to give this a much
more natural like not Shirley Temple
look but I just keep running them
through and usually they drop and I
don't add product to my hair extensions
usually so just to help the blending I
use this John Frieda whisperer way
product my hair is durable at Sur but
that is my finished look so I usually
try and take a selfie like each day not
that I'm an expert but that is what I do
I've taken in front of the mirror and
now go ahead and make my way down for
breakfast and I'm trying to keep my
breakfast super simple it is basically a
boiled egg or two as my protein
and I basically have a carb and I love
porridge as well it's great for energy
and keeping me full I have these little
pots which are from the 21 day fix and I
think they're really good in terms of
understanding your portion control I
think that they're great even if you're
not on like a diet or anything just
because you can end up eating way more
than you actually need
I make oats and I usually use hot water
put it in the microwave and then I have
a portion of fruit is also protein carbs
and pro basically all about having
everything at the right portions and
this keeps me nice and full for the day
until I get a snack at lunch if I be
honest with you so what basically
consists of editing emails you know
responding to comments all that kind of
good stuff and obviously other things
that you don't see going on so during
the summertime you have to try and get
out of the house I can be a definitely a
home a hermit sitting in my pajamas but
now the sun's out I love driving you
know top down I'm running some errands
while I can you know it's not good to be
at home all the time so I do try to get
out and enjoy the sunshine and at this
idea on this day just to go to the shops
and pick up a couple of bits I want to
go in holiday and I went to nice sandals
and I just like walking around and
seeing what's going on in the town
for me I'm like falling in love with
flowers I keep getting bouquets and I
just feel like they change the
atmosphere like in your home and usually
if you get some clothes like clear needs
usually in like the couple of days they
bloom and they last a really long time
like flowers are not as disposable as
you think so these are really beautiful
set and I love getting fresh bread after
my time in France like we have my
friends family the amount of fresh bread
they had all the time I was right right
fresh bread for me all the time and it's
just a nice little thing I'm the miss
weird lady in short way to be similar
filming but she was lovely but that is
basically my summertime routine I'm
definitely gonna do more detailed
routines on everything else but I hope
you guys enjoyed it it gave it some
inspiration thanks for watching guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
