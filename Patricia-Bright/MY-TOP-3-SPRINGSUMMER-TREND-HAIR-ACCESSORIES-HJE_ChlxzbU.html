video is going to be about hair
accessories which I think are really big
for this spring's I've got a few Eric's
reason I'm just going to kind of show
you which ones i really really love now
for this spring summer so the first one
is the tie of a turban here from
asos.com and love it and you can kind of
see how you can look very very beatnik
very very cool very very trendy you just
kind of mess up your hair quite a bit
like that and your turban can look
really cool and mr. Byrne was 12 pounds
but I don't know if you guys remember
last year I bought a turban I'll show
you I have two of these turbines right
exact same style or 12 virtually Adam I
bought these for one pound from a local
beauty supply store actually wear this
to bed at night he knows keima and fresh
but yeah so here's like the avis calm on
and the ones in the shops are probably
more expensive but if you go to a beauty
supply store I'm sure they have these in
the black so I have this in the purple
and the pink because I want to be
vibrant but even you know you can get
this in a black for one pound so that's
really cool let's see what the colored
one that's work yeah fits exactly the
same so you probably just need to dress
it up and make it look stylish and it
looks really cool if you get like a damn
one T on the very top of it you can
probably buy one pin it on yeah that's
the turban
so when next favorite piece is the floor
or headband and I really like this one
because it's got i hope this focuses but
it's got diamonds and each of this this
is from oasis and it's literally on a
band and you can put it wherever you
want to put it so I kind of like it at
the side especially if I've got a middle
part that looks really really cute on
the side hope you can see that it's very
you know bohemian gonna that's great if
you've got like loose waves and messy
messy hair like I do right now so my
final and favorite piece is the metal
hair accessory or hair band which is
just really really cute and this is from
lipsy there you go that's the headband
how cute is that right so guys this is
it on and this is the headband and it's
so so too you can imagine this in a long
white dress kind of prancing in grass
like a proper hippie it's just a really
really cute hairpiece and its really
really unique it's very very comfortable
on another that's really pretty you
don't have to wear it around your head
like this if you don't want to you can
put it up whatever and then if I said
but it's from lipsy calm so guys I hoped
you liked that video it was literally
just a quick video on how accessories
I'm feeling or I like at the moment and
yeah let me know what you want to see
next hi guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
