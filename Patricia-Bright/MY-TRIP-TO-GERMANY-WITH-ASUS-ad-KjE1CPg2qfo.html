Germany ACS said that I can do a live
swap with a girl here we've been filming
some videos that are going to be on the
ACS Channel I've got my Asus Zenbook
free look how thin that is it's
literally so thin it's really light I'm
carrying this around with me the whole
day it's got an amazing battery life and
to doing this what I like the most is
that it just it just looks amazing right
look at that royal blue this is in such
an incredible that is why we're here in
Cologne okay so for this LifeLock I've
actually been set a number of challenges
by a YouTube partner VM here something
goes straight to them so my first
challenge on this incredible life swap
was to get carnival ready it's something
that the locals always do so I had to
get involved are you probably holding
and I come I put on one of these outfit
which it like a carnival outfit which is
only funny so it might seem strange to
some but Mary certainly this challenge
because it's actually a local tradition
and a lot of people were carnival outfit
on a regular basis because this is how
they like to celebrate so my next
challenge is actually to mix my own
perfume at 47:11 which is famous for its
original Cologne kind of named after the
city I didn't get the chance to actually
make my own perfume I had a really good
opportunity to mix up scent and learn
more about fragrances so your hair from
mouth yes yes smells like back yeah well
my favorite yeah but this was definitely
something new and also was a challenge
that brought me out of my comfort zone I
had to be a barmaid for the evening
pouring beer looks a lot harder than it
looks
and the local culture beer here is a
favorite but I had a good teacher
and then finally got the hang of it I
then ended up being up
raided and pouring beer at a bigger bar
and actually serving customers which is
really kind of crazy especially because
they were in their carnival way
today we are going to the chocolate
museum yes okay so my next day in
Cologne was the start of the food
challenges I had my aces had it charged
it overnight and it has a very long life
battery over 8 hours and it was
preparing me to find out more about
chocolate to be honest the food
challenge is probably my favorite and
the easiest because I love chocolate
50% of cocoa is greatest in West Africa
but the beam was originally from here
this is basically meant to be a tropical
environment Alyssa what it would be like
where they grow it
this is my third one people my third hot
chocolate guru however Mary M switched
up a little bit and I tried a local dish
called curry Wurst I have had this once
before but never really like this it's
basically a sausage with ketchup and
curry powder on it and the powder
so I was pleasantly surprised by the pie
worth the sausage is definitely
different to sausage here ketchup and
cocoa powder a weird combination but
overall and liked it and yes I have my
Asus Zenbook sitting right next to me
it's ultra thin ultra line 910 gram easy
to put in my bag and great for
researching what food I was actually
going to eat there and then we went very
Cologne and had the local dish called
heaven on earth
okay so it was tired
very good this is crazy Oh
Thanks
delicious yes yes yeah hey it not to
come back
very good yeah well right
try to duplicate four items
like we
taste everything yes anyone okay I like
it separate - thank you for letting me
try this okay well that is it guys I am
done in my experience in Cologne and I
definitely was challenged to different
things I hadn't done before but as the
whole thing says incredible is now and
it's definitely worth it trying
something different so we are at the
airport now cologne was definitely an
incredible experience we are only here
for a short while so if you guys want to
see more stuff from like my stuff that I
filmed with a food I'll have it linked
where you guys can check that out in the
meantime I will see you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
