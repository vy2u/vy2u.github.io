kind of school story and I've told my
college story which I will link at the
end of the video or below and I thought
I might as well tell you the university
story as well also I wanted to announce
my winners and I'm gonna put your names
in the description box so congratulation
to those who enter the competition and
won and for those of you entered thank
you so much for entering but there was
like 15,000 comments and I had to pick
this at random and I will be doing more
giveaways maybe at the end of the year
because I don't do them regularly and I
spent a lot of money in all of those
items so you now gotta save up for the
next one you know and for the winners as
well I will be sending you a message to
your YouTube in boxes and just so that
and nothing else happens or goes off
because I've heard stories before but I
will be messaging you and just be aware
and if I don't hear back then I might
just what I will pick someone else to
win and keep alert let's go on to the
university story and I'm going to
probably be quick and this might be like
a 20 minute video but you know what I'm
just gonna let it if it's long it's long
apologies if it's too long let's start
so first year I decided to go to a
university in Manchester which is a
completely different city from where I'm
from and I didn't know anybody going
there so it was real shock for me when I
got there I was like I don't know anyone
and I spent the first few weeks crying
really really upset calling home I
didn't go out during freshers week I
didn't do any of that because I was it
was such a shock to me and I never
realized how much of a kind of not shy
but I don't talk to people if they
haven't approached me first and that is
my problem I'm not like a hey but it's
all guys hey to me first like I can like
from there we couldn't create connection
but if people didn't really do that to
me and so I ended up not creating many
connections in that first year
especially where I lived so you live on
campus or halls of residence and I'm
tell you tell you now I didn't know like
anybody on my floor and there's only one
girl who I measures absolute
lovely and let she was okay how he there
like that's how I got to be friends and
her but it wasn't really a close
relationship and there was another guy
who had gone to my college but I'd never
talked him I didn't really talk to him
at college and I heard he was in
Manchester so I gave him a call and like
you know I'm here and I really don't
have any friends I'm I'm really lonely
and he was so lovely as like hell can't
come over come and do dinner at my place
and then we end up having like a massive
dinner and he had a few other
girlfriends from his course who then I
ended up being really really close
friends live and I got to a point that I
was so depressed where I was living and
staying because I didn't know anyone
will talk to anyone that I packed my
suitcases even though I was paying for
the room there and I ended up squatting
with two girls who literally they gave
up my their bed to me I would split my
time one of the girls will share will
share for like three days and then the
other girl will share for four days and
then would like kind of rotate it like
that all intentions but I kind of went
to the other room or something and that
is how I lived my first year even though
I was paying like hundreds of pounds
thousands of pounds for that other place
I just couldn't bear to be there and
first year was amazing and I chose
international fashion marketing that was
a course I did because I was able to be
a fashionista and I hated it I literally
detested the course and I think the
reason I test me because I found that it
wasn't to do with all the glamour that I
fought it was when it came to fashion
marketing that's you're not that
interested in fashion I just like
looking nice to myself and fabrics and
how they're sauced and how they're made
just wasn't of interest to me and when I
realized that coming out of university
like a graduate starting group like in
fashion was between 10 and 12 hours and
I was like you guys have to be having a
laugh like I am not coming out on that
and then I realized I'm entirely money
driven so there was an accounting module
and I was really really good at
accounting so I'm like I could do it
with my eyes closed and get like 75% so
I was like okay I'm just going to do
accounting because the constants make
money and so then I changed my course in
my first year but outside of courses and
stuff I was having a blast like I was
partying all the time like
every night we will go out we will come
in did you do the dress forgot who eats
what's eating eat go out literally party
and when we partied it we just partied
so hard it was good times I remember
like I look at God's sake why they not
got their shoes on that's so gross I
used to be the girl with shoes in my
head walking down the street home so it
was just like really really good times
and stuff like that and I met my
boyfriend in my the end of my first year
and you guys know the story so I'm not
going to go over that again you can like
look at a previous video to find out
that story and like things are looking
looking good and stuff like that so yeah
okay let's work out what happened me
okay it's a second year right this was a
year that was really really hard for me
and because I found that you know a lot
of people stopped talking to me I didn't
have many friends and I was just quite
depressed and I think it happened over
the kind of summer period and like
there's kind of a whole note of
bitchiness that happened with the group
of girls and I was living with one of
the one of my friends and it is one of
the things I always say is that go live
with your friends
so um not that things just got a bit
more bit tense between us and me we
weren't that close and like all the gods
were out close to - they would come to
the house pick up my friends and we had
all been friends and goblak go by we're
going out bye
and I remember sitting at like in my
flat crying by myself and Michael like
don't worry don't worry you don't need
them or if they don't want to be your
friends it's nothing it doesn't matter
but I remember you know that feeling can
you imagine when you're living in a
house with God like Galia friends if and
I'm not still friends live like we'll
still have very much love for and like a
bunch of girls who you used to all used
to talk to will come and then go and
you're just sitting there like rocking
by yourself thinking what's wrong with
you and that was definitely what I went
through in that second year there was a
lot of talking a lot of gossip and a lot
of stuff just going about that was just
so messy and just so
kind of depressing and upsetting but it
took me a while to kind of get over that
and maybe in the first half of the year
I didn't go out so much and I just kind
of had Michael it's just me and Michael
me and Michael me and Michael and he was
my rock and obviously my sister Orion
mom I just talk to them like nobody
likes me don't worry don't need them and
in terms of on my course the same kind
of thing happened I didn't really end up
speaking so many people my course yes
that was how that year ended but later
on in that year I ended up these are the
good times I must shout out my friends
like Irene
Alex hamda like these are I ended up
with a bunch of people who are more
misfits like I don't know if they're
misfits but they were just a bit more
alternative and from being acting like
the girls that are always so girly we're
so like whatever to like the bunch of
misfits what we had like the most
amazing times out when we will go about
this focus there's dedication we're only
out to dance so only out to break a
sweat and just enjoy ourselves
so those times are really good because
we had the greatest night out ever of
all time like just stories and good
times of those and it really like you
know my mindset changed a lot more and
then I was like yeah yeah I don't really
need like to be part of the group or
anything like that I just need to have a
good time I've got my boyfriend
I've got God like I don't really need
anything else so things improve later on
in that year and I had a lot more
confidence and then in the next year
after that this was when I was asked to
run for president of the afro-caribbean
Society at university and I was like
really like oh whatever but and I ended
up running for it and I ended up winning
for my university to be the president
and that was again really really good
times increased like my social group and
the kind of things I was into and it
just was great to have on my CV that in
Iran I was president of the African
society you know people started coming
back and social groups changed again but
I think at this time I was very much
more into church and like not I didn't
go out so much I did a bit him there but
I was more focused on my studying and
like a church and things like that so I
remember that year being a good year
and I don't know like I I don't remember
that year being it wasn't rough or hard
or anything it was just a nice normal
yet oh and I ended up living with a case
in this year I ended up living with this
girl called Rachel and it was really
really nice like having here cuz my
basically my mum bought bought a flat
for me and then I had to find tenants so
each year I I stayed in the house for
the whole time and it's still with
Manchester someone else lives in it now
but um like each year I have new tenants
oh well I was always there if I'd have
the tenants and I named this girl come
Rachel who was literally hilarious she's
like she's like a typical blonde whatnot
and we went out and I remember everyone
until this so we went out to like one of
these kind of footballers night clubs
you know and I think a girl came over to
Mike I was like offering him chocolate
right or something like that kind of
with her boobie but I yeah I don't
really give a damn let whatever and then
this girl was like excuse me do you know
that's her boyfriend over there
I don't think so like I was like this
guy is a hilarious if I had a really
good time with that and the good thing
is that she was come from a completely
different social group that I was from
she wasn't from the same social group as
me at all and so things were sick things
were nice yet she was bit a really
really nice housemate yes so this is a
really good story of what happened to me
in my second years I'm trying to think
nothing really happened much so we had
exams right in our second year and I did
okay and I did the stupidest thing where
there's a court like core scored or
module called corporate finance and I'm
I'm a G at this like I'm good I know I'm
good at corporate finance because I
loved it and I was passionate about it
and you know I was going to the exam
hall after study and I'm a morning study
I so I can study from four o'clock in
the morning till like til the exam time
that is what I'm like so I always woke
up really early and I was like on my way
to the exam hall I saw a guy off my
course I was like hey how are you how
you feeling is that good good how did
you find the exam I was like no I'm
going to
right now No how'd you write it that no
no I'm going to dig them because he's
like Greek so I thought maybe he didn't
understand what I say I came at the end
of the exam versus going at the time it
started so I must have read the end time
versus the start time and I know they've
been a bit of changes to the timetable
and I missed the exam and I had to do a
reset and the thing is if you don't
reset you get capped at 40% whereas when
I the actual mark I got for the exam I
believe it was 77% was what I actually
had and then I got capped I was like oh
my god and I was really really upset by
it but because I know I've got the
ability like and you know it was just a
stupid stupid mosaic so please if you're
doing exams do consider and the
timetable effectively okay don't miss
things and don't come at the end of the
exact my guy final year let's talk about
final year finally it was quite a lot of
great year for me obviously evan has
exams where while you're stressed out
but at this point in time I'm more
focused I'm like I'm really focused I'm
really dedicated and focused to my
course and focus to just doing well
University Church Mike like I was just
focus at this point in time and I ended
up making a whole new bunch of friends
in my final yet why didn't I like meet
these people or my other them on my
course but I had like my study buddies
and we were really good and we just
studied all the time yeah that was there
a bit of party in him now of course
obviously and I think I felt a bit more
settled in myself with what I was
comfortable with in terms of who my
friends were
and then I had a new housemate as well
which is or me and we just got on so
well we just had good time she liked
cooking just like kitchens like an old
African lady in a young body basically
and like we had really really good times
the next thing I was thinking about was
well what am I gonna do off the
university and funnily enough the guy
who went to my college and I didn't
really talk to him that much actually
and because I'd made new friends and
stuff like that but he's like really
smart he's really on the ball is telling
with people you'll be getting jobs and
investment banking and what they were
earning I was I
you kidding me and then he actually
literally he got an internship and then
he introduced me or he told me to go to
an event or something like that and he
knew the recruiter and then he
introduced me to her and then I went to
this event and littering the ball got
rolling for there so after university I
was literally set up to get on this
internship and get my job which was just
the most amazing opportunity over which
has literally opened every single door
since for me and I was lucky in that and
I might do a video I've on my vlog
channel then about this whole
recruitment University grades
internships blog laughing because I get
like it's something I'm really
passionate about so like leave a comment
below if that's something you wouldn't
hear about but yeah so I did my exams
and I was ready to go I was like good
bye University and goodbye Manchester
and it was an amazing whirlwind four
years lots of ups and downs but it's
such a learning curve and I really
appreciate my time at University and
people think it's just it's not just
about the course it's about you growing
up it's about maturity it's about
meeting people outside of what you know
because some of us have only been in
London and only know London people some
of us have only been in Yorkshire and
only no Yorkshire people but you come to
University where you meet people from
India China Greece London England
Yorkshire Scotland like everywhere and
you know what you're all in the same
position and it's just like it's just
such an amazing learning curve and I
think it also prepares you for the world
of work where you have to integrate with
everybody and you learn how to work
together and appreciate the differences
of different people different
personalities so yeah that is the psyche
playing of my hair that is the end of my
kind of school and college story the
other videos I will link below and I
don't know what you guys wouldn't hear
from me next do you like this kind of
stuff do it more like there's no more
the story basically this is it or if you
wanna hear about after university then
leave a comment as well because I can do
one video and like life after you know
city that sounds like a good idea
alright guys thank you for listening I
hope I haven't chewed your ears off
thanks a lot five</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
