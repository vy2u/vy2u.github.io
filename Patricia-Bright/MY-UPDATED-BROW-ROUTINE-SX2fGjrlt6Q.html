perfect my perfect brow you guys know
that brows are so important and I
clearly look very different with
foundation and everything on but no
eyebrows it does not look on fleek
and I thought my eyebrows are just such
an important thing that word days but I
always say eyebrows are sisters and not
twins because everybody has eyebrows
that are very different mine definitely
don't do the same thing so I try to get
them to look a little bit more even but
you know sometimes they want to fight
against me but today I'm going to show
you exactly what I do to get my perfect
brown it should be very easy to do
working in collaboration with House of
Fraser and their beauty confidential
events are going to be happening in
stores all over from the 7th to the 22nd
of September I believe there's 10 pounds
of xxx products when you buy a house of
Fraser favorite and they've got some
amazing things so definitely check out
my link below and get into store there's
going to be lots of activities happening
and if you want to top up on your beauty
this is gonna be the time to do it so in
the meantime get comfortable and I'm
going to show you what I do to get the
perfect brown so this it is gonna be a
chatty video and I'm probably gonna take
a little bit more time on doing my brows
so they take about 10 10 minutes usually
and I do feel like brows are the things
that take me the longest like eyeshadows
really quick but the brows has to be on
fleek basically so I'm gonna start off
by using simply a spoolie I've actually
got the Lancome eyebrow reshape ah this
is a brush it's got spinning on the end
and it also has this kind of fan shaped
brush that's nice and hard I'm gonna
tell you why this side of the brush is
amazing but you always need a Spoony in
your life to tame those bad boys and I'm
using this sushi dough full lash serum
which you can use on your eyelashes and
on your brows I've got quite thin brows
but this sum is good just you know it to
apply it before you put makeup and maybe
if you wanna do it at night as well if
you kind of want to fill those out so
I've started using this on the hope that
it's going to help me get some thickness
and I genuinely don't really do much to
my blouse brows nowadays I just tweeze
them once in a while I'm just kidding in
them up but I used to get them threaded
and I do
like my brows are just thin enough as
they are already so just relax than that
so I really love this I brought a mole
which is from urban decay and this is
just a flexible hold clear brow gel and
I like to brush my brows up a little bit
just so they look a little bit more
fluffy and when I get you know brushing
and putting everything in they look a
little bit more natural
so next I'm using the Bobbi Brown barrel
kit and if you don't know about this get
to know it's got two colors in it it's
mahogany and sable and one's a more of a
warmer brown and one's more of a grey
Brown and I found that we use a powder
eyebrow kit you get a much more natural
looking brow that is buildable I think
when you said something like a gel or a
pencil you don't have much room to play
with once you've drawn that line you're
over but I feel like with this you're
able to get hair light strokes it's got
really nice hard brush as well that you
can basically just brush each little
hair in and it genuinely looks very hair
like Magister it in an upward motion
I like to take my brow down closer to my
eye and I also bring my brows in a
little further as well probably not that
much so obviously they're not perfect
and I'm just going to literally brush
some of the excess I have out and I've
done mine in a way so they look a little
bit hairy like so the key thing you have
to do to really get those perfect
looking brows is to conceal and that's
why I really like this brush because
this side has got this kind of tapered
edge and it's really quite a coarse
brush as well so it doesn't bleed and I
just use my Estee Lauder Double Wear
concealer just to create a nice neat
line underneath to create almost like a
perfectly tidy brow and this is great if
you haven't might you know had them wax
or they're looking a little bit you know
rough this is a really good way to make
your brows look really neat
now I don't mind using a person I'm
going to use the Urban Decay brow beater
I'm just gonna add a little bit more
just thickness to the front of my brow
underneath I might kind of drawing a
really simple line underneath and then
also just using a spoolie at the very
front again just to cause some kind of
fading really does make them look a lot
more natural and perfect alright guys
that is how I get my perfect brows I'm
gonna finish off the rest of my face and
then you'll see my finished look so guys
that is the end of this eyebrow tutorial
it should be quite quick because brows
are relatively easy to do you kind of
just need the tools and the know-how and
then you can do it and it took me ages
to perfect my brows and I always say
eyebrows are sisters not twins they are
slightly different shapes because you
know what my eyebrows are just naturally
different shape but I hope you guys
enjoyed as I mentioned that I'm working
in collaboration with how's the phrase
that you've got there Beauty

store all over you can get 10 pounds of
some amazing products so make sure you

to top up on your makeup collection this
is definitely going to be the time to do
