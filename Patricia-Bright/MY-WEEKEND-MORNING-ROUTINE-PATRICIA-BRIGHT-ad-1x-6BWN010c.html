i wanted to do my saturday morning
routine as you can see my life consists
of my husband and baby and you know
sleep it in isn't a thing anymore this
happens at 7:30 in the morning even if
it's a Saturday but it's all good
because it's my favorite day of the week
hubby and I usually every morning chat
and then I like to make the bed and just
open them in there is taking that fresh
weekend air in and then make my way
downstairs to get the breakfast in the
road during the week my breakfast basic
because this or porridge but on a day
like this I will you know get some eggs
or Salina butter and do something a
little bit special
you guys know absolutely to put mighty
mica drinks Iranian tea which is kind of
like Earl Grey and I just love me and PG
tipps
and a maltose I like some peanut butter
my glass
two slices I just have one or I'll have
it so we will go ahead and have
breakfast in front of the TV in the snug
and it's also good I usually like to
catch up on creme de la creme which is
like my favorite show and then we will
just have breakfast together including
Grey
then go ahead and have some playtime
some short time we'll just chill for a
little bit until I make my way upstairs
okay thinking we time now I leave in the
fabulous bed I think a little bit of
time to myself all the weekends you guys
believe at another skincare must concur
needs more sleep to keep this person
radiant and glowing and I thing that the
best way to have amazing makeup is to
have prepped and really good skin and it
wasn't an idea in which I don't have any
makeup on for the night before I'm using
the new l'oreal fine solid real this is
a really calming and nourishing makeup
remover and if you've got your makeup
still left over this is going to get a
right through to it I also have a bundle
deal with a few other put up where you
are able to get sixteen pounds and
there's an extra 20% off our the details
below but it is really nice really nice
and really creamy bottle surety gentle
and kind of worth it I'm going in with
another three months you guys know I do
learn a lot and I choose other payment
it is the lovely of your payment which
is for the nominal this one is amazing
so those large or girls is my favorite
one and this is also part of my bundles
as well I will put it on my face leave
it on and run home and sort out some
bits and bobs in my house but I can
leave it on for about 10 minutes and as
I said I just get stuff done but that's
cleaning that got preparing for the week
after
right now the note shopping this or that
jazz and then I will go ahead and get
ready for the day
you
you
okay so this is my everyday makeup which
isn't actually massive some people this
is a helmet collection but I can be my
whole face in like ten minutes using
everything that's in here and I go say
skincare is important if you want to the
makeup you need to have Pratt skin
I'm using the new L'Oreal Hydra genius
and a water this is ridiculous
it contains olive oil which is really
good for sensitive skin also contains
hyaluronic acid which if you don't know
is one of those products or ingredients
that really hydrate skin and holds a lot
of water and if you know someone who's
dry this is really really good
gel recreate when you put it on I think
it's amazing and then when I put my
makeup on top I love it this is also
part of my boots bundle which you can
get with the other product but I
mentioned and there is 20% off but it's
actually only 16 pounds and that is why
I love L'Oreal the products are amazing
at a really good price
okay I am done I decided to do a bit of
a next round this Saturday
highlight popping now I'm just going to
enjoy the rest of the weekend so my
weekend with probably Intel doing
something nice together with race maybe
going on a war the women I like to go to
the shot I might drop her off at her
grandma's house and I'll go shopping
maybe go to the box park and see some
friends have a cocktail have some food
and that is basically how I like to
spend my weekend so I hope you guys
enjoyed that video gave you a little
inspiration and in the meantime I'll see
you later also do make sure you check
out my bundle it is a bargain and those
products are some of my favorites or
