I got here with me today we've got great
pain hi hi she's very happy to be here
actually makes an appearance on this
channel once every few months probably
when I've had some epiphany or some
learning or some lesson that I want to
share with you guys but today I wanted
to share some of things that all my
basically on my mom's ultimate winter
checklist and some perhaps that I have
been using during this winter season I
found to be super useful with a baby and
she is like 9 months now and boy has it
been a lesson but I'd like every single
moment of it so yeah I partners with
optimal ready-to-drink follower milk to
bring you guys in this video and
hopefully what I've got on my checklist
some of you ladies might want to add all
to you I'm going to let this get one go
because she is ready to launch for this
camera right now so the first thing on
my mom's checklist is to avoid having
cold wet words on your baby's bottom
there is nothing fun about a cold
website and if you find that your baby
is sometimes a bit like skip it when you
want to change them and they don't like
to be change because it's uncomfortable
they're startled try warming it up
especially during the winter what I like
to do is basically put wet what upside
down cover the main make up about 30
seconds it just warms it up a little bit
or to use a blow dryer to give it a
little bit of warps before it goes on my
baby's bum so have you ever had a
blanket on your stroller your baby kicks
it off the end up on the ground covered
in the dirt and mud and wet oh it's not
great and it specially during the winter
having a blanket in your stroller is
like essential so one of the hats that I
found that was really cool was basically
to use a key lock which you can attach
to the side of your stroller and you can
create a little bit of a hole inside
your blanket on both sides and it kind
of creates a permanent blanket that
cannot be kicked off by your little one
it's really great to keep them warm and
you know
your blankets not going to end up on the
floor also and that you had is that you
can add a hot water muffin in a few half
an hour so before you go out just to
make sure it is nice and toasty before
you leave the house then the next thing
is all about always being prepared when
you are out and about and you have got
bottles it is just long and that's the
last thing you probably want to do when
it is cold outside it's so important to
be prepared and I absolutely love the
axonal ready-to-drink follow on milk
having a ready to drink formula milk is
amazing I just twist the cap pour it
into the bottle give the little one
something to drink when we are out and
about and it makes life so much easier
this is all at my checklist but every
time I need the house because it makes
so much difference so during the winter
tight socks gloves hat all those little
things are essential because you know
what it gets cold out there but the
thing that is so annoying is when a
basically go missing they go missing in
the laundry basket they get missing and
wash everything they just go missing
like it's so annoying that you're like I
can't find that sock where's this what
was it where the hat with a bubble where
the hat with an ear like if they just
disappear I don't know if it's just me
but it just goes where you find oneself
but you can't find the other and your
kid is a kid with the odd socks
everywhere it's just not a good look one
of my favorite hat is basically to use
one of those zippy laundry bags should
keep all those little bits in it means
that they never get lost
always put in the exact same place and
you can also follow the laundry bag into
the washing machine take it out and you
know where everything is all at one time
that way you'll never lose a sock again
but it wasn't cause one of those things
that about happened during the winter
time if you are unlucky however you
don't want to make it worse by baking
rub in this area it's really horrible
well as unknowns gets really soft or
more the blowing of the nose and all the
wiping and the things you can happen to
your little one what I really like to do
is make sure that I use a
wrong tissue or a wet wipe and I like to
put a bit of moisturizer on it so
coconut oil or something that's a little
bit
emollients and put it on the wet work so
that when I wipe it stays nice and moist
and doesn't go dry and crackly and make
the baby even more uncomfortable so when
it comes to being out the stroller the
worst thing you do about monthly takes
the stick that you don't know Wow like
disappearing off into space because
there might be some that ice or some
needs or something that you slip on the
ground with you can add a little bit
more grip to your stroller simply by
adding these little plastic repeats
around the will you can put three or
four on and it's a really good and
effective and cheap way to just add that
added security
finally the onesie like the onesie is my
favorite thing on my mum's entry
checklist because it's just easy and as
you can see Grace's wearing act like a
onesie with the ears and everything
which is so cute but it means that I can
put having relatively normal comedian
can like crazy on the inside put on in
its really nice big onesie and it means
that when she did from hot to cold
environment it is a quick on and off but
if you've got lots of jackets and lots
of layers and all that kind of stuff
your kit your baby you might hate that
being changed my baby hates me change
but if I could just go this picture out
very good she's not going to be
overheating and she doesn't be cold when
she's outside so like that is my mom's
ultimate winter checklist I hope you
found it useful there might be some
things on there that you definitely
didn't know about we'll just do an order
until you do let me know if there's
anything else that you yourself would do
and in the meantime okay bye
yes yes people hey guys how you doing I
mean one of those really</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
