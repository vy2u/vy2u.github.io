feel like I haven't sat down here and
I'd like a proper chit chat with you
guys for ages and so I'm gonna do that
today and that's gonna be in the form of
me telling you my youtube story and
basically how saying yes has brought me
to where I am today some of you guys may
know that I'm an NCS ambassador and I'm
so glad to have the opportunity to be a
part of it and basically it's all about
saying yes and I was thinking about my
youtube story and how saying yes has led
me to be where I am here today so I'm
just gonna tell you guys the story from
the very top so I started when I was at
university and it was a case of I was
really into my care and hairstyling and
somehow some links was shared from
auntie on mica form I was on on to
YouTube I was it hopped on what's this
YouTube videos girls very exciting and
then I found out the word Beauty there
were these girls who are doing my makeup
and all this kind of stuff and I was
like hooked I was addicted I started
watching that girls like flower push and
a couple of other girls do see candy
like I loved her Fafi net x3 these
amazing girls are just like my bread and
butter and I was like I really want to
do this but I felt really nervous about
it because there was no there was a
really many British girls something was
that you're not but you should just do
it just say yes and just do it so I
don't even I didn't even do any research
I just bought like a camera I was like
okay I'm gonna record videos but I
didn't tell anybody because it's
obviously really odd and really strange
to record yourself and put it on the
Internet
I didn't tell anybody I kept it a secret
even Mike my husband my current husband
who's my boyfriend and I didn't even
tell him about it and I basically I
didn't have a tripod I didn't know what
a tripod was I
a shoebox to put my camera and all books
and I would put my camera on top of
these books or my shoebox and I'd be in
my bathroom and I used to share a flat
with the doll and I didn't want her to
know that I did it as well so I'd be but
I do and she was at the house or she was
in the house I've kind of been speaking
really quietly in the bathroom to myself
and I did wonder what she's thinking I'm
weird but I was like you know what I
didn't care I just really wanted to do
it when I started out I didn't really
know what it I wanted to do and I have
to be totally honest of you I was very
much copying other people and I haven't
didn't have my own voice I didn't really
know who I was initially I came out
being really like and it just was like
that's so cheesy it's really not ready
Patricia is it well that's how I first
started out and sometimes you just got
to start out by just just do it and you
will evolve and stuff and I started out
write that and I remember like on my
first video and I was like clicking on
it I was like oh my gosh like three
people watched it four people have
watched it turn TV would watch it and I
was so excited not realizing that that
was me who was watching it like every
time I clicked on it was a new view I
was like oh okay maybe no one's watching
me so I stopped clicking on it and just
like would peek then when I got like a
comment I was like no like someone's
commenting I was back on that oh my gosh
thank you so much I'm so glad and
there's particular people who even till
today like I really recognized their
names that they still comment but then
they were leaving me comment all the
time and they really really encouraged
me just to keep doing the videos again
it was in secret I would not tell anyone
you need but it was like my little my
little world money oh you know place to
be and then I got to a point where I am
just kind of relaxed a bit more started
doing a couple more tutorials home
videos some style videos my style was
all fall back just awful now that I
think about it back then but it's
hilarious to watch to be totally honest
I might put a little playlist
my my old videos that are available for
viewing I remember when I got my first
1000 subscribers I did like a video on
having 1000 subscribers and I was like
guys happy and I was so a static I don't
know if I did the giveaway or not I
don't have giveaways or big things back
then but I just did this video just to
thank everyone and I think about them I
told Mike that I had the channel and
what was really cool is that he was like
oh my gosh baby you're famous he was so
excited that I had like 500 views it's
like 500 people watched a butcher shop
okay yeah but it was so cool like those
early days of doing YouTube and I will
tell you that I definitely haven't
discouragement from doing it I remember
that like I had a couple of people say
to me you know don't do that when they
found out I don't know how they found
out but they found out that I did
YouTube and they were like no you
shouldn't do YouTube it's really
dangerous
I remember hearing you know someone got
was killed from YouTube and that you
know your future employers might find it
and it's really bad and the rember
people just telling me this and it was
like I very much felt quite nervous like
oh no maybe I shouldn't do this but um I
kept saying yes and I kept doing it and
I just tried to keep it a bit more quiet
I remember when I was interning in New
York I've got some videos from my time
there and I remember that someone came
across my camera and we were taking
loads of photos together and they saw
like me like they saw the video of me
like talking to the camera and that one
guy was like what's Patricia doing she's
so weird we're actually filming on her
camera and I didn't realize that he had
like snuck it around to all the guys in
my internship group and I was like oh I
just have this channel like I just
mentioned it in passing the next day and
him and a group of guys had found my
link or found my channel and literally
they passed it around to the whole
internship group and my videos were
being played in our classes and I was so
embarrassed I was so embarrassed to the
point by
almost shut down my YouTube channel I
stopped uploading like while I was in
New York because I thought they might
find me again and I like did all the
guys who were there I took them on
Facebook I was like I don't want these
guys to be able to find anything about
me I was just so embarrassed about it
but I got over the embarrassment I
decided to start owning it and being
like do you know what yes I do do videos
on YouTube yes I really like it
yes it's really fun and guess what there
are people who are watching me it might
not be your cup of tea but it's my cup
of tea you're my cup of tea might be
playing football my cup of tea is
talking about clothes and styles to
other people on the Internet
so don't be angry at me okay and I
started owning it and people just you
know started to forget about it I
started to grow more and more you guys
have seen where I am today it has opened
up so many opportunities to me and I
have met you know some amazing people
from the other youtubers to my
subscribers I remember that when I went
to Singapore the fact that I could go to
Asia and sit down and go to like a
market with a goal who watched me out
there how amazing is that
and like I thought I'm going to might
get very emotional about that but it's
amazing and I feel so you guys have
never seen me cry so I'm not gonna cry
on this but it's such an amazing
opportunity
bye guys I'm so right so this is a side
of me you don't get to see which is
someone who's very very emotional and
sentimental at times but and I had so
many amazing opportunities via YouTube
to you know to meet some wonderful
people across the world to make friends
to I remember
you know having some down times and
moments where I've been like really
upset and really emotional really
excited and I just record a video and I
upload it at that point in time and you
guys are always there watching it I'm so
happy that I can encourage you guys and
also receive the same back some other
opportunities that I've had I've been
able to meet you know Whitney port and
interview her directly I am an
ambassador for NCS and I think the
opportunity to encourage young people to
say yes via my youtube channel I have
gone to Fashion Week shows I have made
amazing friends you guys have seen me
grow on here and YouTube has been that
platform that has allowed me to do that
and I sincerely appreciate being on here
and this vision wasn't necessarily about
like my appreciation but when I'm
speaking to it I so appreciate having
the opportunity and it was just simply
saying yes in the first instance and
carrying on to say yes continually
despite what other people were saying
which has brought me to where I am today
where I used to work in finance I now
work in you know online video and
advertising and something where I'm able
to release my creative juices because I
said yes to doing you know YouTube
videos I also wanted to give you guys a
couple of tips because people have been
asking about this kind of thing and if
you want some more detail on this just
let me know in the comments and I do
like a full-blown like YouTube tips
video but some basics the first thing I
say is important is to have your voice
and to have your idea the one thing I
say is there's only one you there's only
one me there's only one you so find your
voice find that thing that makes you
stand out find that thing that you're
passionate about and just executes your
personality in it when you do that
create your channel I've got this tip
here that says lights camera action you
don't need much but you need a decent
camera I used to know
have a flip screen camera only up until
about six months ago to be totally
honest of you so you don't need anything
fancy but I would advise any form of
cannon I'll list a couple of recommended
ones in the bottom lighting is really
important as well but I always say
natural lighting gives you the best
finish like I'm not I'm using natural
writing now and I have a reflector I
like to reflect natural light because it
gives you a glow as well but again I
will list in the description bar just
some tips on three-point lighting
systems and some links to some lighting
you can get next just because system
despite if no one's watching you or not
keep uploading upload regularly and you
know trying to in your style all the
time don't go from you know doing
mountain climbing to sewing you know
it's too different but maybe you want to
add a little my mountain climbing trip
amongst all your sewing videos next
reach out to others on your level so
that's by leaving comments liking other
people's videos sending people messages
just be part of the community YouTube as
much as a video platform is a social
network so just make sure you reach out
to other people who are about your level
and bigger and smaller but it's
definitely you know best to stay within
your pick your peer group because
they're gonna be going through the same
issues that you're going through and be
persistent in sharing and being part of
this don't just make videos for the sake
of views make videos because you enjoy
it and enjoy being part of this world
and I'm gonna have to say it make sure
you just say yes and do it I know so
many people who think about doing it and
they haven't done it yeah it's just like
just do it you're thinking about it do
it so guys I really hoped you enjoyed
that video I didn't expect it to get and
emotional as it did I'm gonna link like
a playlist over at my previous videos
just so you can see
I came from don't laugh at me too much
