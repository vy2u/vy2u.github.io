I'm gonna do a video on holiday
essentials I'm gonna kind of do this in
two parts one's gonna be you know the
serious stuff the stuff you really need
which is what I'm gonna do now and then
the novelty I'm gonna do is going to be
on the clothing and the bikinis and all
the good stuff or the fun stuff for
going on holiday so as you guys know I
mention it in every single video I'm
going on holiday and I'm off to Malaysia
Singapore and Barney and these are
tropical countries very very warm and
you got to just make sure that you're
prepared for any kind of eventualities
out there so the first thing you're
really gonna want is to get your beach
bag and this is my beach bag which I
just actually bought from H&amp;amp;M and this
was just 30 pounds and it's big enough
to fit anything up on in it and it's
also got a latch on it so I definitely
think that this is one of the
accessories that you definitely need for
your holiday so let's see what I've got
in my beach bag oh good you need your
slippers or your sandals because to be
honest you're not gonna be one of
wearing clothes shoes in the hot weather
and I bought these these are mighty
wedge ones and I bought these from
Primark and these are 12 pounds and you
can see the lovely lovely detailing on
it that kind of gold gold twist
detailing on that and it's just because
you don't want to get really really
sweaty feet and get really really dirty
and these are real leather as well for
12 pound that's amazing and it means
that your feet can breathe as well but
you're probably gonna need some flippity
flip flops something like this now these
are these are Anthony Ryan and look how
big these on if anyone who doesn't know
I have a massive feet my feet are
massive okay the worst part about me yet
part of my perfect in
confections actually but you need your
sniffling floors from when you're on the
beach when it gets really sandy and wet
and soggy you don't a mess up your
really nice pair of shoes you can get
these for one pound these are one pound
fifty from Primark so sticking with
accessories you want to get a gorgeous
big beautiful Sun Hat do you not I have
loads of Sun hats and loads of big hats
but you just need something morosely fun
for the summer no shield you from this
the heat and everything like that honey
I think it's really important to have a
plastic pouch which a key goes with
whiskers if the wall doesn't it and this
is so you can keep when you're on the
beach you can keep your coins and your
notes and everything they won't get all
soggy and Sandy and you know it keep
protected from the elements in a plastic
tie so let's go back into my bag of
treats and talk about the boring stuff
you really need your Sun protectant okay
you'll be looking at factor 30 plus
really and even if you are dark skinned
trust me you need your Sun protector I
know a guy who's black as night he went
to Cuba or something like that and he
had sunburn okay so it's really
important no matter what skin color you
are to use heat protectant he protects
them this is a net to use skin
protectant and I always get bitten in
tropical countries because I know my
blood just tastes so good to mosquitoes
what you want is your repellent okay you
definitely need an insect or a permanent
you can find these everywhere and yeah
it's just really important lessons your
chance of getting malaria I've actually
had malaria before I had malaria when I
was 13 and since then I was very very
cautious about insect repellant and also
taking your chaps beforehand and if you
do need to take you know your Daniel and
some malaria tablets do take them it's
really essential and if you do get
bitten then it's really great to have an
antihistamine or a bite cream or
something to stop you from bitching
because if you itch a lot you're going
to get scars finally the part of that
you know the bits and bobs your needs
it's probably going to be one antiseptic
hand gel so you'd ever know what you're
going to touch you know maybe people
aren't that clean or you know you're on
buses or in public transport just going
to be dirty just get your hands nice and
clean before you eat anything to stop
you getting any kind of stomach bugs or
anything nasty in inside of you and if
you do end up touching any bugs or
anything
grotesque like that you can get some
diarrhea relief tablets now as funny as
this is I think this is essential
because I know lots of people have gone
to Morocco and Egypt and they call it
like the the Egyptian bug where
virtually everyone who goes there always
gets diarrhea it's so strange and you
know I'm not gonna take any chances
no matter where I'm going no man you
never know what you're eating out there
and just to stop me you know dehydrating
or anything like that I will have my
diarrhea tablets just in case and along
with that I think it's very important as
well to carry along your own bottled
water you don't drink water abroad ever
I never drink water but I do drink water
in Europe depending on what country my
I'm in because even in Portugal I didn't
drink the water out there but you never
know your body will be certain used to
something so guys that is the end of my
the boring bits for your holidays and
keep a lookout for all the good stuff
that I'm gonna talk about later on so
thanks for watching guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
