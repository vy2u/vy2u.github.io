my autumn face and kind of how and where
my autumn makeup I'm really gonna focus
on the lipsticks that I'm going to be
wearing and the colors that I'm into and
I'll show you how I apply a dark
lipstick what do you think isn't the
best waited in front of girls with
darker skin so just to quickly run
through it I'm doing a lot more with my
eyes in terms of I've not got false
lashes on today but usually I'm wearing
a lot more false lashes and thicker
eyebrows I've changed my eyebrow shop
I'm not sure if you've noticed that but
they are a lot fuller now and a bit
darker today they're not as dark as
usual but I just really like this kind
of you know statement eyebrow now and it
means that you can go quite neutral with
the rest of your face and that's it
really I shadow is I think I'm done with
eyeshadows on this they were neutral or
a brown but I'm not really into coloured
eyeshadows blush I'm still using my
sleek Santorini as it's a really bold
color that really comes out quite dark
on my skin so on my lips I I'm loving
the kind of dark plum ease and that's
why I kind of bought some from Mac
recently and today I'm gonna focus on
the rebel or colorable which looks like
this and also how to combine it with
kind of a dark lip liner and this is a
Mike moss so those are for really really
dark lips you can get that effect now
the thing I found with the rebel is it's
really not that dark plumbing effect its
plumbing but it's really not that that
dark so it's great to use the knight
morph I did buy the Prince na but I
realize hold on lighting off does the
same things and let me save myself some
cash so I'll go ahead and show you how i
line my lips and apply my rebel to show
you my autumn yeah okay so to get the
real dark look it's a great idea to kind
of really bring your lip liner in not
just round it apply it with a stroking
inwards motion rather than just the line
as that will kind of make it have more
of a gradient effect
and can make your lips as large or as
small as you like my lips are huge and I
have no Cupid's bow so I kind of put the
shape that I would like my lips to be
and also holding it at an angle as well
we're just smoothing it up a lot more
okay guys so this is literally how I
would be wearing my autumn lip and you
can kind of see it goes really well with
the kind of honey-dipped
hair and another video is short and
sweet but I hope you enjoyed it as
watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
