feel-good routine in collaboration with
Kinder Bueno I'm sharing with you some
of the things that I do to make me feel
better when you know things aren't
perfect so obviously in the morning it's
either a horrible morning or it's going
to be a great morning so I try to get up
with passion and I try to avoid you're
getting on my phone and scrolling
instead I will stretch taking some air
and then I will maybe have honey and
lemon to really freshen me up after that
I try to complete a goal early in the
morning recently it's been trying to
work out and not necessarily just go
into the gym I try and do a 30-minute
walk but usually I bring up my clothes
and have them set aside so that I can't
avoid it
after that it's all about getting active
and some of us break into sweat and
tears when you think of being active but
the thing about it once you start you
feel good you release endorphins you
feel good on the inside and your body
feels great when you get that blood
pumping and again I'm not a gym freak or
anything like that but I definitely like
to make an effort so after the gym I
like to have a post-workout treat
Kinder Bueno is like one of my favorites
and it's like the most deliciously
different chocolate it just feels extra
special when I tuck in to one of these
especially with a cup of tea I think not
treating yourself is a way to add
variety to your life you can't just have
strict regimes and it's great to just
feel good so next I work on my to-do
list and this list can be quite long but
it's so good when I can finish my to do
this so I have something like getting
the groceries done and also clearing out
my closet this is a major one on my list
of late and I really went in on like one
side and I can't wait to show you guys
my entire room but basically I decided
that I just wanted to have a massive
clear route and it was on my to-do list
for a long time so just taking the time
to just work through my list and
although this took me a day or so to do
it it felt so good when it was done I
also decided to you know swap my makeup
my sunglasses and just you know refresh
my life and just clear up and my to-do
list definitely got a little bit smaller
as well
a tidy desk equals a tidy mind and for
me it having a tiny mind is so important
jotting down my thoughts my goals my
aspirations is really important and I
like to do it when I feel comfortable so
chocolate beside me the cup of tea and
just feeling nice and relaxed like with
a burning candle so I usually just write
down all the different thoughts that
have goals - aspirations that you know
get me excited and make me feel good and
I think that when you you know write
things on paper it's like releasing them
off your shoulders finally you've
definitely got to pamper yourself and
for those of you who might be in a rut
sometimes you don't want to get ready
you know you want a new address like
rubbish and not bother but when you do
your routine or makeup routine or look
after your skin and your body it will
make you feel better even if you don't
feel that good so I like to do my makeup
routine and put a nice lippy on even
during those times where I don't really
feel like doing it because I feel like
once my face is done actually feel
better about myself so it can be a
little bit hard to you know do it but
once it's done I feel great
so guys that is my feel-good routine in
collaboration with Kinder Bueno
hopefully I shared with you some
deliciously different ways to make
yourself feel good when you're maybe not
feeling perfect so guys thanks for
watching hi guys I know that I've been
wanting to do this video for a really
long time and it's about my college and
university story and kind of at the
start of my career story and some of the
learnings</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
