video is going to be a tutorial on my
kind of nude summer look although it's
not been that sunny my sincerest
apologies and it looks like I've missed
out the first section of this tutorial
on the basic I apply my concealer and
foundation but if you really want to see
that then leave a comment below and I
will try and do it for you but to
continue with my summer look the main
thing for me recently has been having
juicy looking brows I don't want to know
what it is
I just love really thick brows that just
really frame my face but I always use a
concealer underneath and blend it in and
I'll list all the products in the
description bar below but some of you
wanted to see how I do my brows and this
is it
so I'm trying to ensure that you know my
makeups not too thick so I apply my
contour with my fingers and this is the
sneak dark peak here and then I use my
brush which is a Sedona lace brush to
blend those contour lines and everything
else in a bit more also kind of add a
bear at my temples just to make my face
with nice and smooth
my blush is the same blush that I've
been using for sleep for years which is
flushed and you can see it just add some
rose to me also the lights changed but
here I want to show you is how I do my
nude lips and I know it might look a bit
scary right now
I'm using baby Emma's peaches and cream
but blended in it's absolutely a perfect
nude for darker skin tones
finally I'm topping everything off on my
face with some powder just to mattify me
and set everything in place I'm doing
minimal contouring with my nose is just
really minimal but the main thing I like
doing is highlighting through my face so
down my nose and just on my forehead as
well just to give me that summer glow
you also apply gold in the inner corners
of my eyes now just to again make my
eyes look wild wild like bright and
summery touches of brown in my crease
just to make my eyes look a little
bigger and you guys to see my blue line
art like everywhere I love it it make
really makes my eyes pop and finally I'm
winging it out with some liquid eyeliner
as well it's all about kind of focusing
on my brows and my eyes this summer and
having flawless skin
almost forgot I just add a touch of
mascara as well as always Oh guys that
is my summer makeup done wondering if
you guys can guess what I'm dancing to
probably not but if you do leave a
comment below so thanks for watching so

summer styles and skin so don't forget
