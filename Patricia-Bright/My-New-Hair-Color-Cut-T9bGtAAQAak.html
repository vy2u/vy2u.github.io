video as you can tell it's probably
gonna be about my new hair and I have
had my hair cut and I no longer wearing
hair extensions now I'm not sure how
long that's gonna last for but I will
attempt to make sure that it lasts for
at least a while for you guys to enjoy
it for me to enjoy it as well I really
want to hear what you guys think you
know do you like it do you not like it
do you think it suits me I look a bit
weird because I've always thought I've
got like this a moon head right and my
hair extensions are able to kind of
reduce the size of the moon in my
opinion right where's this hair smells
like head everywhere but it's quite cool
and I feel quite clean and crisp and
different like that so that there's this
kind of look and like this kind of
uniform of like hair extensions and
stuff so I thought I'll let me just
break out a bit and do something a
little bit different and I told you guys
that was inspired by my sister who did
the same well she actually got her
caught all off into a pixie and I'll
show you what it looks like I wasn't
brave enough to do that but I was a
sight yeah I mean I'm definitely gonna
try something new I'm definitely gonna
try something different so this was my
mom was definitely a pop this is not
what it looked like when it left the
hairdresser's when it left the
hairdresser's it was a bit more like
what I don't like so society let me just
adjust it I thought I'd go sneak a star
but the great thing about this has my
find that it's really really versatile
so if you guys would like to see more
videos on like hair tutorials like this
short hair and stuff and then leave a
comment below and I will it from me
start doing that and but I'm fully a new
beginner and don't know much about like
I'll probably just do this like side but
done it's so easy that I did it last
mine
I already got like a few kinks in it
which is a bit and annoying shaking but
it's fine I don't know if I can show you
the back but you can come again tonight
it's like short like that it it's meant
to kind of be a bit rigid but it's
really not that great deal that's all I
don't know if there's anything else that
I need to tell you about it I got it
done in hyper fuel which is in Balham
sometimes you've got to spend the money
it puts 117 pounds a lot a lot but I did
get a car I didn't get it relax I did
get a treatment as well so but that's
still expensive in my opinion as well
but yeah whatever ice not talk about it
it's here now it's done yes that's it
and yeah but really cool I feel really
different with that I hope my star
doesn't have to change too much or the
things I wear I don't want them to
change that much but who knows we'll see
and I can wear it off as well I'm that
was one thing I said to them I need to
be able to get into a bun so at least if
I'm gonna put little donut bun on it and
like change it up big is funnily enough
it seems that short hair is quite
versatile so yeah that is it again oh I
wanna hear from the guys like I know
that the guys that usually comment on
the videos but if you're guiding you're
watching what do you guys think of my
girls a short hair you know if you like
it you like it more then like long hair
and this is just a bit more like
research I want to see what people will
actually think out there and yeah that
is it but yeah when you hear it okay
guys bye
oh definitely thumbs up if you want to
see more tutorials like short hair and
stuff and maybe if there are ways I can
kind of switch it up and do stuff to it
yet
alright guys fine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
