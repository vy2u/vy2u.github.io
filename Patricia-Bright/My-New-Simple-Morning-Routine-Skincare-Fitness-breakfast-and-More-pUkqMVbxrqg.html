simple morning routine I'm super excited
because I feel like it's been ages since
I've done one of these this is basically
my routine after I've done my second
sleep so usually I have a wake-up around
maybe 4 to 5 when I wake up feed the
baby put up back down to sleep in her
mother's basket and I go back and have a
little bit of a nap and then I wake up
after this and give myself a little bit
of time so at the moment I've been
trying to kind of stay fit and get back
walking and running and exercising
everything and I think it's so important
to keep your gym where or what you're
going to wear you know running or
exercising close to you so you don't
have to think about it I have like a
bottom drawer
filled with my kit and my house clothes
and basically I get ready before doing
anything else and I put myself in
something that's gonna movement motivate
me when I get back it's time to
basically pamper myself and refresh
myself for the day and I start off by
brushing my teeth as any normal person
would do so I picked up some new beauty
items from Westfield Stratford City they
are having a month dedicated to beauty
throughout May with lots of live Beauty
events and lots to offer especially for
the bank holiday weekend and seeing as
I've been suffering from quite dry skin
lately I knew that the Clinique Body
Wash was going to be ideal for me it is
the deep comfort Body Wash some of you
guys may have seen this lots of times it
is absolutely amazing and makes it feel
so moisturized after I shower kind of
locks in the moisture and keeps my skin
silky smooth after that I going to use
the origins checks and balances and face
wash this is so frothy and it really
does make you feel like you're having a
deep cleanse but is nice and gentle
after that I go ahead and moisturize
myself afterwards and I always take my
time to moisturize especially catching
those elbows this might seem a bit weird
but I actually like to use this night
cream from Estee Lauder it's the night
wear plus I find this is so light I love
it at night and in the day it keeps my
skin so moisturized but without it being
greasy I love it so even if I'm going to
be in the house all day I like to put a
little bit of makeup on just because you
never know who's gonna turn up at the
door and I mean sometimes it makes you
feel like you're actually doing
something but it's just being a bum at
home so I usually put my brows on and a
little bit of lip balm as I say
breakfast is the most important meal of
the day and I try to keep mine as simple
as possible I try to have some fruits
and I usually make a smoothie out of
fruit that I've already frozen and
chopped up or I will go ahead and have a
porridge as well so with the frozen
fruit I either buy it pre-made or I do
it myself with fruit that I put in my
fridge that might be almost on its way
out and it's so much easier to do it
like this and it lasts for such a long
time I squeeze in some lemon sometimes I
add some honey and then pour in some
water I don't really like bananas so my
smoothies are never thick but this is
delicious
even though it doesn't look that good
because of the berries
after that I usually eat porridge every
single day it's such an easy breakfast
it's really good for you and keeps you
so full and for me I need to feel full
in the morning I just add water to mine
some people like milk but I don't really
back milk anyway so so I then go ahead
to eat my breakfast and I usually take
my laptop with me because I love looking
at what's going on in the beauty world
and as I mentioned Westfield Stratford
City will be hosting the beauty unbound
event which is going to have so many
brands there there's master classes
there's talks free beauty treats so much
will be going down I have all the
details in the description but below
about it but do try and get yourself
down there before the 30th of May so
guys that is the end of my very simple
morning routine I hope you enjoyed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
