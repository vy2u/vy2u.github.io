an updated night and skincare regime and
I know things have looked a little bit
different in my background we're
actually staying at a hotel at the
moment because our house is being
redecorated and we thought why not just
take a little bit of time out but let's
get started so after a long day the
first thing I want to do is get my
makeup all off and I use the Bioderma
and my cell solution I must say it's
probably one of the best it's a great
way to get your makeup off and it's very
gentle I usually kind of do it like two
times so one of my skin problems is at
large pause so I like to do a warming
mask here and there to really cleanse
out my pores this one's from the body
shop and it's amazing it heats up as you
use it and when you're done your face
just feels so so clean without feeling
dry
so once in a while I like to run myself
a nice relaxing bath I'll go lie and say
I do this all the time but I try to when
I can and I love this product it's
called deep sleep by this work and it's
just a beautiful amazing aromatherapy
shower gel and it just smells beautiful
and really helps you to relax so after
having a bath and washing off my face
mask I go ahead and use this vitamin E
night oil from the body shop this
product is absolutely amazing my face
was so supple and moisturized in the
morning without feeling greasy I'm
absolutely in love and I also take the
time to do a couple of facial exercises
as well because it's great for your skin
I think I had to use the Miller Harry
citroÃ«n and body lotion to moisturize
the rest of my body so before I go to
bed it's all about being relaxed this is
what this whole regime is being about so
I also spray a kind of aromatherapy
product as well which could also spray
on your pillow and like jump into bed a
really good thing I started doing it
actually just writing all the thoughts
that are in my head in the evening so I
can see much more restfully so guys
that's basically my relaxing at night
regimen it's super simple and it really
does keep my skin nice and supple and
keeps me relaxed as well or night you
tell me that you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
