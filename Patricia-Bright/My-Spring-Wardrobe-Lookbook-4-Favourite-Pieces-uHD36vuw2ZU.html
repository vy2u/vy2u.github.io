my favorite items for spring even though
it's pouring with rain at the moment so
pastels are everyone's favorite right
now and they are mine
dresses are amazing they suit all types
of figures and showing up if Lincoln
spring is a must to a dress like this I
like to add a touch of leather some
boots some metal just to make it look a
lot less girly and just I don't know
bring make it a bit more modern looking
a pretty dress is always perfect for
spring so my next favorite trend are
striked and any type of pattern really
stripes can be flattering on everybody I
know some say they can't but vertical
stripes can look good on all figures
stuff like these on my shoes here
definitely add a bit of flavor and
different to kind of outfits in the
spring and for some reason I've been
loving gold leaf Sydney it just adds a
bit of brightness as well very springy
working
so lace onward got an absolutely love
place it's so feminine it's so flirty
even if it's see-through it's fine I
love it the seafood tops like this I
think it's best to get bando tots I know
American Apparel sells a lot of these
Urban Outfitters just to kind of keep
dignity underneath them a little bit of
flesh never hurt anyone if I are gonna
wear something seafood like this I find
it's best to kind of cover up a bit more
and just let this shirt do the talking
so my final spring trend is texture
anything that makes you feel kind of
warm and cozy lets you think of animal
horse or something I love that right now
cuz really spring isn't that room it's
rainy it's just really annoying but
these things make me feel warm like a
woolly jumper some leather as an animal
print so long slouchy cardigan is the
best way to top off like an outfit
that's a little bit mini I balanced
they're wearing socks and boots just
because I think it looks cool
