is going to be all about my summer
makeup routine I'm going to show you
things that I do just to kind of switch
it up now that the Sun is here so you
guys have probably seen my skincare
routine if not you can see my son
skincare routine and to be honest when
it's really hot you really don't want to
be wearing really heavy makeup or lots
of foundation so if I can get away with
just you know like just a powder and
nothing else then they will but I think
it's really great to have a base or what
they call a Primark basically and I'm
loving Porefessional by benefit I found
out about this at one of the benefit
events I take it went to and there's a
little makeover my system I couldn't
believe it and it just kind of I've got
quite larger pores it kind of just sits
on top of them and really smooths out
your skin and also makes your skin look
less greasy and less kind of I don't
know shiny and I just use it on the
areas where my pores are like what it
does you can see that it really just
smooths out my skin almost instantly it
does look a little grey so you do have
to put a bit of color on top but I think
if you're like white or lighter skin
toned that this is easy you could just
wear it by itself
look even so if I'm gonna wear
foundation hopefully if it's not a
really really hot day I will be using
sleek new revive it's their new silicone
base foundation and I'm the color nutmeg
if anyone was
and that's the nine eight eight and I
literally would put a few dabs that
won't irritate me just let us look
you'll see runway dark areas
I like to choose my stifling brush to
brush that in and I won't even bother
with you know foundation anywhere else
because it's just too hot too much
effort to put in terms of powder I will
be wearing Mac's mineralize in a deep
dark dust that like all over and it just
gives you that nice kind of matte not
too greasy looking one thing I'm never
tired of is my concealer and even in the
summer I'm definitely still wearing my
Mac concealer I deliver I rep because
they're not free flex pay is gonna find
this in my house but yeah so I just
apply that around my eyes as usual using
my fingers and I stick to the NC 50 as
well and on my eyebrows more let's do
the same thing however I'm using a brown
liner from back yeah eyebrow pencil and
I don't know if you can tell I've had my
eyebrows tinted so they look a little
dark come in and lovely I don't do it
heavy and then I just brush them in a
bit more so on my cheeks I'll be going
for a really bright flirtatious color by
sleep called Santorini now I don't know
if you can tell how vivid it is but it
looks full or wrestling this one of
those that you kind of just touch it
my cheese so my lids
I'm keeping it really basic and I'm just
going for new was it in the crease I
will be going for a nice dark brown will
be using Mac's expresso used at the time
now the big big selling point of my new
summer look is that she my blue liner I
am loving loving loving blue liner and I
hope you can see like the Lighting's
really bad blue eyeliner
watch it it's just amazing but yeah I'm
noting about a dark blue liner makes the
whites of your eyes look whiter and make
sure our eyes look brighter so on my
lips I'm tired between two colors one is
sleeps peaches and cream which you can
see it's like a really peachy really
nice peachy color and I'm torn between
that and the Lady Gaga liver look at
Graham color as well which I've done but
with whichever color I'm wearing I'm
wearing it of loads and loads of gloves
being quite daring with the lips this
summer or the Lady Gaga but I do quite
like this right now so we'll stick to
this right now okay guys so that it's my
summer makeup I hoped you liked that
video something to give you guys an idea
what I'll be doing and also what do you
want to see next
I will be doing a summer lookbook so
watch out for that yeah then we can get
the filming rolling eyes either</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
