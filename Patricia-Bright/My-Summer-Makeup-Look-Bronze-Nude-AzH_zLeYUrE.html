video is going to be all about my summer
makeup routine i want to show you things
that i do and just to kind of switch it
up and let the sun is here so you guys
have probably seen my skincare routine
if not you can see my son the skin care
routine and to be honest when it's
really hot you really don't want to be
wearing really heavy makeup or lots of
foundation so if i can get away with
just you know like just the powder and
nothing else than I will but I think
it's really great to have a base or what
they call a Primark basically and I'm
loving pork fashional by benefit and I
found out about this at one of the
benefit event side and it went to and it
is a little makeover my system I
couldn't believe it and it just kind of
got quite large pores it kind of just
sits on top of them and really smooths
out your skin and also makes your skin
look less greasy and less kind of I
don't know shiny and I just use it on
the areas where my paws are like what it
does you can see that it really just
smooths out my skin most instantly it
does look a little gray so you do have
to put a bit of color on top but I think
if you're like why or lighter skin toned
that this is easy you could just wear it
by itself look even if I'm gonna wear
foundation hopefully if it's not a
really really hot day I would be using
sleek new revive its their new silicone
based foundation and I'm the color
nutmeg if anyone wants to know and thats
1988 and i literally would put a few
dabs that won't irritate me just let
look you'll see
runway dark areas and I just use my
stifling brush to brush that in
and I won't even bother with you know
foundation anywhere else because it's
just too hot too much effort to put that
in terms of powder I will be wearing max
mineralize in a deep dark dust that like
all over and it just gives you that nice
kind of matt not too greasy looking one
thing I'm never tired of is my concealer
and even in the summer i'm definitely
still wearing my mac concealer and
maneuver I don't ref cuz i ran out free
flight of stairs gonna find this in my
house but yeah so I just apply that
around my eyes as usual using my fingers
and I stick to the NC 50 as well and on
my eyebrows more let's do the same thing
however i'm using a brown liner from
Matt yeah eyebrow pencil and I don't
know if you can tell I've had my
eyebrows tinted so they look a little
dog come in and lovely I don't do it
heavy and then I just brushed them in a
bit more so on my cheeks i'll be going
for a really bright flirtatious color by
sleep called santorini now i don't know
if you can tell how vivid it is but it
looks fluorescent so it's one of those
that you kind of just touch it put that
on my cheeks so my lids I'm keeping it
really basic and I'm just going for new
or in the crease I will be going for a
nice top round using Mac's expresso used
at the time
now the big big selling point of my new
summer look is actually my blue liner I
am loving loving loving blue liner and I
hope you can see like the Lighting's
really bad blue iodine are watch it it's
just amazing but yeah I'm nothing about
dark blue liner makes the whites of your
eyes look whiter and makes your eyes
look brighter so on my nips I'm tired
between two colors one is sleeps peaches
and cream which you can see it's like a
really peachy really nice peachy color
and I'm torn between that and the lady
gaga and leave a little gap Graham
Connor as well which I'm done but
whichever color I'm wearing I'm wearing
loads and loads of glands being quite
daring with the lips this summer or the
lady gaga but I do quite like this right
now so we'll stick to this right now ok
guys so that is my summer makeup I hoped
you liked that video just going to give
you guys an idea what i'll be doing and
also what do you want to see next i will
be doing a summer lookbook so um watch
out for that yeah then we can get the
filming rolling I see those later I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
