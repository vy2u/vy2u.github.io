summer makeup video today everyone on
Instagram been asking me a lot about my
current makeup and what I'm using so I'm
going to just share with you
you know summer's here the weather is
getting super hot and some of us just
look greasy and I have oily skin I never
used to think I only skin but now I
realized I really do have oily skin
especially around here I know that my
nose is probably glowing like a disco
ball right about now but it's all good
clean up we're just gonna roll over
there so the first thing is my nan come
it's the 10th idol ultra 24 hour and I
use a color 14 and I really do love this
foundation and yes I still wear
foundation I find this to be a very good
mattifying foundation doesn't leave me
oily at all but the only thing I'm doing
is I'm just applying a lot less than I
used to do and I'm using my brush it's
the full face coverage brush from Bobbi
Brown which is my most favorite
foundation brush like ever but a little
bit more in my areas where I'm a little
bit darker and you know I can never say
no to my Kevin a qualm concealers and
but I'm a little bit darker at the
moment because of them just the weather
so I'm mixing 15 and 12 so that it's not
so right because you shared I keep quite
bright but you know you can kind of look
lucky Ghostface Killah if you keep doing
that you know
and I'm using my stippling brush the
mini one from raw techniques which I
love for my concealer I'm just going to
use the excess to just contour down my
nose I don't worry guys eventually I'm
going to blend everything in but I'm
going to move on to my brows now for my
brows I use the Bobbi Brown and brow kit
in the dark which is like it's changed
my eyebrow life basically as you can see
I don't really have much you know and
they have much eyebrow action going on
so I need to draw these in but I find
that with the powder it kind of gives me
and I don't know it's just soft up then
doing a pencil yeah I try to be really
careful she's one line at the bottom and
then one line at the top I do bring it
forward just a little bit
and I just blend back through and
eyebrows are sisters not twins so I can
never get mine as a match but my
eyebrows that this eyebrow is very
different to that eyebrows I just have
to roll with what the eyebrow gods are
telling me and I'm just going to consume
underneath with the same concealer
nipple when she would first right so I
know that I probably look insane right
now like quite catchy but what we're
going to go ahead is use kind of like my
big blending brush and I'm going to use
my Mac mineralize powder and I'm just
going to blend literally everything in
like just kind of even it all up
and then I use my sleep brushes my
favorite is pink teeny it's quite a dark
plum you actually don't need to use a
lot the sleep brushes are actually
amazing they're better that my favorite
ones like completely and then fund me
for my contour I also use the same brown
that is used for my brow kit now for my
eyes I'm solely using this like all the
time I use this kit unless I'm doing a
different look but it's the Sigma
neutrals and palette warm neutrals this
palette is amazing if you go my blog is
patricia bright Kokoda UK i did like a
some love all my all my favorite
products and this is definitely in there
and what I use for my everyday face so
that's that lovely so I usually just go
for this matte Brown on my lid
so in the crease I usually go for this
purple here or this brown here for my
liquid liner
I love the mentioned piece in one of my
last videos it's the Revlon Colorstay
liquid liner and I loved it I loved the
end it's just a nice thick felt that
just gives me the perfect like and I
look oh and my eyes I am using the
Revlon Photoready mascara again a really
goodness car
I think they've pinned out quite a lot
and I know that some wearing false
eyelashes which is a little bit sad but
I'm gonna try and actively grow them
back when I don't really know if I
should stop wearing falsies right this
is what I look like about falsies I
don't know what do you guys think folks
these no falsies before my lips I'm
going back to just soft news you're not
wearing a lot of pinks recently in quite
bright colors I do like but sometimes
you need a new I'm using Mac's chestnut
to line my lips
well for a phase of just not liking my
lips I'm not liking the shape of my lips
I love the size but I just felt like
they didn't have much shape but I'm just
like you're going to work with what you
got and and I use my favorite favorite
lip gloss
it's called seduction it's my charlotte
tilbury it's actually the most sexy
flattering news I've ever ever ever
tried but I love it so guys that is my
summer makeup finish I just added some
eyelashes because you know I can't help
myself with the eyelash it I'll list all
the products below but I've also have
them in picture format on my blog as

details and I wanted to give just a
quick shout out to the vlog brothers
