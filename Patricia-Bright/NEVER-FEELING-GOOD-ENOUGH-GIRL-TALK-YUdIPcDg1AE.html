wanted to do a really like a topical
video because this has been playing on
my heart for a really really long time
and I don't know why I haven't done it
yet and I did the 20 things I've learned
in my twenties and you guys know I do
kind of talking videos like this and
sometimes I feel like I just talked to
waiting what sometimes I'm a little bit
opinionated one thing that has been
pressing on my heart like a lot recently
has this this feeling of never feeling
good enough and I know some people might
look at me I think why would you not
think you're good enough you're gonna
make you live you're good YouTube
channel all this kind of stuff and I
understand there may be some of you guys
who are out there who you don't
necessarily feel like you're good enough
there's so many elements and it can be a
case of like your gift or your skill
like you don't feel like you're as
skilled in something as you want to be
it could be the fake case of you don't
feel that you look as good as you want
to look it might be that you are not
where you think that you should be in
comparison to everyone else I realize
that this whole element of never feeling
good enough is because sometimes we're
just comparing ourselves to a benchmark
that isn't us and I got to this place
where I just felt like I'd be completely
honest but in regards to physical it's
like I don't look like that I don't look
like that and I think for someone like
me being in the meet like in the
industry that I'm in and it's weird how
how it has taken a totnes not
necessarily at all but it has impacted
the way I felt about myself on a
physical appearance now it's so funny
like know I've worked in the corporate
world and I've worked at like top
companies and anything and being as gone
being a black female never never
actually worried me at all I never felt
like it was hindering I never felt
that's a problem I never felt like I
stood out I felt like due to my skill I
was able to be respected based on the
knowledge and the experience that I had
and it made me a strong candidate and so
going to a place where it's a case of
what do you look like and
you know how does your hair look good
what you wearing and it caught it can it
really started to take its toll because
I never that I never placed a lot of
confidence in my physical appearance but
I placed a lot more confidence in my
like head smarts and the way I
communicate that was how I really felt
really confident in that right and I
want that fast about the way I look like
I look good sometimes I look like crap
some other times me and I got to this
place where basically I have to always
be like look perfect but I really wanted
to like help you guys and help myself
when it comes today the first thing
about this but I've realized was that
comparison is the thief of joy this is a
well-known statement but I really
started to feel right just comparing
myself to all these different benchmarks
it just doesn't work like the only thing
I can really compare myself is to myself
how was I yesterday to how I am today
and I my improving or not we're
literally sitting down in the world
where we spend hours and hours consuming
information about somebody else some
other people someone else's life why am
I not watching my own life what your own
life don't be sitting there comparing
yourself to Tom Dick and Harry well you
need to be looking at Bob okay I need
only looking at Patricia honestly
comparison is the thief of joy now the
next thing is if you don't like
something change it or change your
attitude it's a well-known statement
from Maya Angelou and that's something
that really really resonated with me and
it's almost like you can't sit down
complaining complaining comparing
comparing and just keep doing it cause
at the end of the day the only thing
it's gonna do is eat you up on the
inside and it just fills you with so
much negative energy and negative just
negativity that it actually causes you
to just go into a downward spiral of
despair and disgust and self-criticism
you're gonna change it be that your
weight be that you'll care be that your
education be that your your reputation
what are you gonna change your
dude about it okay if you can't change
it at all you don't want to change it
you need to get into a position where
you're going to be like you know what
this is just the way it is and this is
the way I'm going to roll with it all
you need to get your butt into gear and
so you know what this is getting on my
nerves I'm going to do something about
it this is super important and I've got
a lot of emails from people who said
that like they receive like a lot of
negativity be that from their friends or
their families people who tell them like
regularly that they're not good enough
or that they're ugly or that they're
theaters like they're failures and I
know that there's this and there is this
common thing of criticism from those
around you and trust me sometimes the
people around you can be the worst they
don't necessarily want the best for you
or they don't know how to say a good
thing to you now you have to get into a
position that are you going to absorb
that because if you absorb that energy
it's just going to make you feel even
even worse but you need to know to be
like a reject those statements and you
actually have to physically say like no
I do not accept him let people your life
knows that you know what I'm not going
to take what you say about me
no I'm not human you've got to say
enough in a way that is respectful or
even if you have the whisper I'm
Geographic while you're being told about
yourself just go accepting this that
moves on to another element which is
about speaking life onto yourself I
found that when someone is very critical
of themselves which is something that I
can be like it's oh my worst thing I'm
very and very critical because I really
do push for like excellence because
that's just the kind of person I am and
I will realize that I've got Patricia
that was that's rubbish that's rubbish I
was like to myself you can't keep
telling yourself that you're rubbish you
can't keep telling yourself that that
doesn't look good and you can't keep
telling yourself that that's not right
you need to learn to even speak those
things that are not as though they are
okay and I think that when you get into
a position where you actually start to
speak a right one to yourself you shall
receive these things and
it's really funny I don't know if I want
to tell this I'm gonna tell me I'm gonna
tell this story because I am a believer
for those of you who don't know and I
remember that I used to worry a lot
about like finances and I think it's
just because I'm a really really
cautious person when it comes to that
money and income and all that kind of
stuff and even up until recently and I
decided to like you know pray leave all
these things in the hand of the Lord
within two weeks right I had literally
the most amount of like blessings that
came in to my life on that specific area
right house being valued at you know 40%
more than what we bought it for my
mortgage rate coming down by six hundred
pounds a month basically happy getting a
new job of three times more than what he
earned previously and some really cool
opportunities come coming my way because
I started to speak in life unto myself
and I don't know what it is and I said
this many a time but life and death is
in the power of the tongue so speak life
you need to tell yourself that you are
good enough you need to tell yourself
that self that you're beautiful you need
to tell yourself that you're great and
the next thing is that you really need
to understand your identity where you
begin to know who you are you become a
lot more confident in what your
capabilities are and what they are not
not everybody is gifted physically okay
and it doesn't matter
not everybody is gifted academically not
everybody is gifted in business not
everybody is gifted in hair-like but
when you start to understand what your
gifts are what your identity is and you
roll with it man it's a my final tip is
when you don't feel good enough you have
to realize that it's a constant process
you need to keep confirming yourself and
keep remembering these things and keep
rejecting what people say and stop
comparing yourself on a regular basis to
really embody things that make you
better and realize that you are good
enough you are good enough despite what
the world may say despite what other
standards might say despite what
somebody might say despite that your
work
look as good as you wanted it to look
trust me if you compared your work from
a year ago to your work today you
actually see well you've gone come on
leaps and bounds and you can visualize
that if you keep consistently wanting to
better yourself you will be better run
what everybody else is doing don't watch
what everybody else is doing do your own
thing and compare yourself solely to
yourself and you'll realize that you are
good enough so guys as you can see I get
very emotional when I talk about topics
like these people because it really does
come from up good I have to teach myself
and I have to teach now you know tell
you guys you know what I feel and Joey
feels like so much release when I get
that out quickly before I end I wanted
to let you know about a site called
