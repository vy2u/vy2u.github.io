the side finally your passions actually
think that boys man what is it that I
actually do
hey guys welcome to my channel it's
looking a little bit different around
here isn't it people very different I'm
in my fancy dweller swivel chair today I
hope you guys like it and we are in my
office and I thought it would be nice to
come and give you guys a little bit of a
tour of my like new office space because
I knew that so many people were asking
me about it in the vlog that I last did
and I thought I would answer all your
questions I'm like what do I do
as well as just give you guys a little
bit of you know tips and tricks into
maybe doing your own thing and you know
my my advice and my experience of being
self-employed so firstly I'm going to
give you a tour of my office and I'm
going to chat it through while just
dropping bits of my office because it
will just make it easier so I mentioned
in my vlog that I have a shared working
space which is really cool for like
creative people or people who work in
tech and there's like lots of like
working deaths and stuff but I have my
own office inside this place and I have
about three people who work for me but
it can go up to six if I have interns
and that kind of thing now I really
wanted to have this office decorated
like I like it and to suit me but I
wanted it to be kind of you to be but
also I mean like kind of text Spacey so
I'm going to show you some of the bits
and bobs that I have that I really
really like so number one you guys can
probably see my wall behind me
the guys at dziena are my favorite as
you guys know they have got the best
prints on the internet they're so
affordable and they're so so stylish and
I basically go on the web site and work
out how I want I just copy the website
design basically to look at how I want
my images to be layer laid out because
there's so many prints to choose from it
can even be a bit overwhelming but if
you're someone who's super creative and
there's your color scheme you can find
prints however you want and I'm not
going to lie I'm a massive fan of them
I've got their prints all over my house
in my loft room which you guys have seen
so yeah
dizzy and I print a number one at the
back of me and then I got my kind of
boss desk area which is my chair and my
death which are both from dwell and I
my co wanted my own mic separate special
desk that was white and glossy and just
you know had that kind of vibe that was
a little bit more you know Here I am but
the thing about this desk it's really
cool like for me to do my makeup on for
me to work on and I just put everything
on it it's big enough to put all my
notebooks and all my letters and all my
pens and on my makeup and everything on
the desk but without feeling crowded and
I have my laptop and all that other
stuff in it as well so I'm a massive fan
of it and then I just have this like
storage unit which I just put bits and
bobs and to business I just wanted it to
look nice which is why I've got like a
Tom Ford box and a light and for those
of you guys who don't know I obviously
do YouTube and I do lots of makeup and I
receive a lot of product and I found
that for me having my house filled of
products really wasn't you know
something that was going to work for me
in the long run so I have this unit
which I feel is like the best makeup
storage ever and I have a system of how
I work out what's new what's not what
should I try watch like test and this
way I've been able to do way more
tutorials of newer in products they
basically give them a try because I've
been wanting to do that more and more
but I just never got around to doing it
but I love the way this unit kind of
zigzags and crosses over it looks a
really really cool and then in the
middle I have a desk which fits eight
people so there's been times where we've
had seven I think I've had seven people
here all at once and it's just a nice
little co-working space and I'll be
honest with you a lot at the time I sit
on the desk in the middle is Abajo
because I like to be part of the team
but I love the fact that everyone can
work together and like shout across the
table and then I also have this really
nice hope sign and everyone basically
calls us the hopefuls and they for our
company was called hope and when people
like walk pass because you can kind of
see in and saw so yeah that is my office
space I love the big windows and I've
the exposed brick and I love the fact
that we are in an area that I really
love and is super up-and-coming it's not
major leap or anything but is super
up-and-coming the mayor came and visited
the office I was so mad I wasn't here
but where we are is like really growing
it's like the new tech city of the south
and to get into this place first was
just absolutely amazing I will link
everything that I've got and that
shown in this video in the description
bar below so you guys can check that out
but yeah that is what I've got what I
wanted to do something that was a little
bit more helpful and give you guys some
insight into what it is that I actually
do as well as some tips and tricks on
you know starting your own business or
working for yourself or just making some
extra moolah because I know that is what
lots of people want to know and I get so
many questions on it so I'm going to
answer some of the questions that I have
been sent and asked on many many
occasions so number one what is it that
I actually do well darlings I am a jack
of all trades no not really
I am do YouTube of course as you guys
see watching it on YouTube and if you do
not know obviously people do make
incomes and really good livings on
YouTube and the way they do that is by
making Adsense revenue which is when you
get I can add that place before the
video and on the side and on the bottom
as well as doing collaborations or
sponsored posts or an add posts on their
YouTube or their social media content
and by having their own product so that
might be a books or t-shirts or hair
extensions or Footwear accessories and
that's basically it on the side of
having obviously my youtube channel I
then have a hair extensions business
which is why hair company hey which I
started about eight months ago and is
doing amazingly I try not to no push
products or push it in your face but
obviously that's what I wear all the
time and I love it and it's my baby and
it's amazing and yeah it makes me so
happy and if you guys know anything I'm
like literally love with her always have
been so it was inevitable that I was
going to go down that route and I also
work with brands doing lots of
consulting outside of the stuff that you
guys see on YouTube as well so that's
basically it now that's not all I want
to do I want to do so much more
I've got like a to-do list as big as
this but I do lots of different things
and that's what I do and I'm totally of
the mindset that it is you can live very
well if you have multiple streams of
income
and even when I had a job I always had a
job I always had something that I was
doing on the side because I was that
kind of person you know like I am bored
I come home at the end of the day or the
weekends and I'm the kind of person like
hmmm what what could I be doing what
could I be creating what ideas do I have
what ideas don't want to bring to life
because I feel like life is all about
creation and if you're not creating what
are you doing and that might be creating
life or creating beauty or creating food
or creating happiness but I'm all about
like constant creation if you're not
progressing you're walking backwards and
you guys made that about me so I get
loads of questions from people asking
how do you start your own business how
do I start my own business how do I work
for myself how did you do it and I got
the answers but I'm going to try and
share with you some of the insights and
you know some of the things I think that
are really useful for anybody who's a
bit worried about doing that other thing
or just doesn't have a clue on how to
start or even what to start so I
actually wrote a brief a blog post which
is on Patricia bright co uk on how to
start your own business all the four
things they don't tell you in school
which i think is quite a useful read so
if you want to pop over there you can
definitely do that
so I think when it comes to deciding on
what you actually want to do I think the
best thing to do is to final your
passions actually think that all right I
actually think that that follow your
passion is just the dumbest thing ever
because they might be honest with you my
passion is watching Netflix eatin food
and chilling with my family that is my
passion every day chinwag over coffee my
passion however I get it and I think
it's important to align passion to skill
and then what where can add value into
the world or add value into the lives of
people around you so there's things that
you'd like but do you think that there's
a way to bring that to people in a way
that they'd be willing to pay for it so
something like YouTube it's an
entertainment platform we entertain you
with our lives or without information
we inspire you with our style or our
picks and we give you ideas and that is
what we do and you know if I am
consulting what I do is I give my
knowledge on something to people who
want it and they pay for that service
and if it's my hair extensions company
it's because I felt like there was a gap
in the market for simple buying of hair
extension so I think it's important to
think about where do you see that
there's a gap in the world for something
that you might be able to bring to the
world basically so is there a gap is
there something that's needed and do you
think you can fulfill that gap in a way
that is unique to you
and I do feel like there is nothing new
Under the Sun being stopped because
somebody else is already doing it or
because you've seen it done before
somebody might like what you do better
than the way someone else does it and I
can invest the friend who basically says
to me if you're going to fail is fine
just fail fast and that's like my
favorite favorite sentence if you ask my
team I say fail fast everyone all the
time I don't care what you're going to
do try it see how it works if it fails
whatever hurry up and fail until you get
it get get whatever you need to do right
because everything fails at least once
or twice or three times and in all the
feelings you have this totally learning
the best thing I would say is just try
it's just to start something that you
want to do and if it's gonna fail let it
happen and I also say that there's
people who are scared of losing money
honestly if you don't fear money you
will never not have enough and we are so
lucky that we live in a world where and
you'll never go hungry and more than
likely you'll never go homeless and
especially for in the West and I'm not
talking about in other places but the
worst that could happen is that you lose
some money and you start building up
again like it's really not that bad you
might have to live with your mum you
might have to live with a family member
so many entrepreneurs started out like
that they've lived in garages they've
lived in know in the streets that they
have lived in there
parents houses till they were 45 and I
think that if you're someone who doesn't
like to take risk and if you're someone
who is scared of failing potentially
entrepreneurship is not for you but
another thing I also think is really
important is that read as many books as
you possibly can so rather than you
making a mistake learn from people
who've already made the mistake but I
love that who did I get that from and
Tai Lopez he reads a book a day and it
was the concept of he reads so much I
could see or rather learn from somebody
else they're making those mistakes and I
think that's so so so valuable and
really really important right so moving
onto YouTube specifically because this
is something I get asked about all the
time number one is what camera do I use
I use a 16 with the EF 35 millimeter
lens and I use a rode mic on top I
personally don't think that people need
to use the 60s I think that a TD of the
70d is really suitable a much more
affordable my camera you know was around
2 grand my lens is about a grand and
Mike's like 250 pounds you can start off
making youtube videos with 500 to 600
pounds and I mean that's a couple of
people's nights out you know in a month
stay in your yard and save some money if
you would like to make videos in regards
to lighting you can get umbrella lights
on Amazon for 25 pounds and then you can
upgrade if you need to but natural
lighting is absolutely amazing for
shooting videos as well and you know the
best tip I have for starting out is to
basically do what your interested do
something that you feel is going to add
value to either you or to somebody you
know don't just and potentially you can
do things that you're just enjoying
yourself
you know just stirring it yourself in
the mirror you know but you know overall
how do you add value back to the world
that you live in and I think that's what
it is when I used to do tutorials and
even with a whole video as much as
people think not a whole video is a bit
indulgent whore videos are some of my
most popular videos because I'm showing
girls what's out in the shops and
providing them with links to a bargain
that I saw and I'd like to I love this
and I look alright I like that I've been
looking for something like that for ages
when I started on YouTube I was doing
Primark cause and like cause I found
this just the way I would share with my
sister or my cousin or something like
that it was a way to show people what
you've got
not because of like oh look at me I'm so
amazing it's like girl know so it's a
value in a way that it's not everybody
is going to understand you may have a
different way to add value also my tip
when it comes to starting business is
going to be a bit boring but it is to
get your numbers and your accounting on
lock when you really start making money
it's very important to know how to do
your accounting a lot of people I have
an accountant of course but I know every
single balance sheet every single profit
and loss statement I know all I do
invoices myself and I know lots of
people do not but you need to learn the
process of money coming in money coming
out and understanding your cash flow so
important so my favorite accounting
tools are basically zero and quick book
I think I prefer zero more I'll put
links in the description bar below so
you can check those out but basically so
important to know how much money you
have coming in when it's in who your
outstanding debtors what you are
outstanding expenses and because I have
a product based business it's really
important for me to know how much cash I
have to basically use on my stock and
you know some people go to the site and
I'm out of stock and it's a case of you
know the money that was meant to come in
had to come in and we haven't used the
money on the stock and it's crazy if you
don't have your cash flow or not their
struggle is really well but I don't want
to get into too much detail because
that's really hard but before you start
thinking about you know your business
think about how to manage your
accounting and make sure you
your taxes and you'll realize that there
are people who are multi millionaires
who will go who have gone bankrupt two
to three times over because they haven't
paid their taxes and it's not a joke so
being on top of you know what do they
say pay Caesar what is due to Caesar and
that's very important and my last tip is
whatever you're going to do do it up to
the best of your ability do not do
things half-assed because you will get
half-assed results and it's so funny I
found this over and over when I do this
thing where I like say I hone in I like
make a vow to myself like I'm going to
dedicate this amount of time and I'm
going to do this I'm going to do that
every single time I dedicate myself to
something it it literally goes through
the roof every single time and I know
that some of you guys might be at school
or multitasking and you might have like
a little bit of an idea what I would do
would say is that right I've got a job
right now but this is the idea that I
have you better do your job and you
might need to sacrifice a lot to focus
on the thing that you want to do and I'm
not going to like when I was um you know
on growing my youtube channel and my
business I did I worked every single
Saturday and Sunday but there's no I
basically only stopped working weekends
since I had my baby like I work every
single weekend I did not go out I did
not do coffee my coffee where there's
work to be done this moment Evita
there's editing to be done because I
dedicated my entire self to it if you're
not willing to sacrifice for anything
that you want to do the likelihood is
you're not going to get very far in it
you don't have to be the smartest you
don't have to be the most beautiful you
just need to be the most dedicated and I
think Will Smith said this he's like
he's not the most talented person out of
all of the actors who are out there he's
not the smartest he's not the best
looking but he basically gives his
entire whole being to what he does and I
think that is so important no matter how
old you are or whoever you are or what
you're doing you have to give your
entirety to it to really reap the
results anyway guys that got a little
bit pretty she didn't
you know what I'm like you know what I'm
like but I hope you guys enjoyed that
video and you found it useful and let me
know what you want to see next so thanks
for watching guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
