closet room tour and I've been saying
that I've been wanting to do this for
absolutely ages I am not completely done
yet
I don't think I'll be completely done
for a really long time but I'm I'm happy
with it and the thing is is that so we
have a three-bedroom house and this is a
spare bedroom but we don't have any
kiddies or anything yet so I use this
spare bedroom as my closet room or my
filming room and I have a lot of stuff
in my opinion and to other people this
might not be very much but whatever and
in America you guys have like um like
close like actual walk-in closets we
don't really have that like houses he
don't really have that what we have our
wardrobes everyone has a wardrobe one or
two wardrobes in their house and that's
what I've got 99.9% of my stuff is from
I care because I care so good at just
giving you some great stuff but I'm
gonna show you and talk through and I'm
also going to do a makeup towards what
because my makeup collection can be done
in like 10 minutes so that is fine so
guys this is my room as I mentioned this
is basically the spare bedroom which I
have converted to a closet room let's go
ahead and do this tour this is actually
a sofa bed it can be folded out into a
bed and we don't use it very regularly
it's kind of ugly in my opinion probably
gonna change it to something else like a
nice looking sofa bed but it is useful
and practical and I do like it being
here I'm wearing a pair of shorts hey so
this is a member here that um it's
basically a movable mirror I just move
it around it doesn't bother me because I
didn't really have a full-length mirror
but I really wanted once I bought this
one it is for my kid so things have
moved to pick this used to be in on the
opposite side of the room
this shoe cupboard is not it has most of
my shoes or the shoes that I wear
regularly and I like the most I do have
shoes which I keep downstairs but I
tried to keep a couple of shoes right
here and some shoe boxes and stuff and
then my boots couldn't fit into the shoe
cupboard but I do wear them so I list
them right there and above I keep my
bags now I can't keep all my bags in
there but I keep quite a few maybe six
bags I have them up and in there and
these are really stiff I bought these
for Matt Matlin and this bookcase is
that she just a yeah this shoe cupboard
is actually a bookcase from Ikea over
here is my little area of junk and I
have some like hexagons shelves which
was meant to put up I haven't put up as
yet so I don't really know what I want
to do and I'm just a couple of things
that teacup and Henry they've been here
for years
probably will be there for years and
that's pretty cool so this area is my
new dressing up area I used to have the
really large wardrobes but I basically
split this wardrobe into two and I
bought me the doors to separate it and
fit them into the alcoves just because I
felt that the cupboard used to be over
there I felt like it was just too
imposing and I get really bored really
easily so I switched it up so I wanted
to kind of go through my wardrobe a
little bit so you guys get an idea of
how I organize my stuff so guys this is
my main color I wanted to show you guys
a little bit of my organization of it it
is actually relatively organized and in
this closet it's where I keep the
majority of the pros that I wear on an
everyday basis and I know it doesn't
look like there's a lot there but it's
really organized over here I have my
denim section you'll be surprised what
I've got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and I can fit
10 or 11 pairs of denim jeans into that
little cubby hole and the same for
trousers so in there can get B 10 pairs
of
means ten pairs of trousers it's not 15
pairs of trousers in there and I just
like folding it like this rather hanging
rather than hanging it because it
basically takes up a lot less room then
having everything hung and I kind of
like the way it looks it kind of feels
like a shot and I do the exact same
thing with my jumpers they're not kind
of coordinated or anything but it's just
easy for me to pull out items that I
wear really really regularly this
hanging thing it's from I care I've had
it for ages they do have plain white
ones but they had run out where I wanted
a plain white one so I just got this
floral one so in here I basically just
hang my outerwear and I like jackets and
blazers t-shirts and shirts and like a
couple of skirts and a couple of pairs
of trousers this is the stuff that I
wear very very regularly or things that
I really really like and I don't like to
iron up here as well I keep my hats but
we have about eight to ten hats that are
in that section I have my Chanel bag in
that box to the right up there and I
have my Prada bag as well in there so I
do try to keep my designer stuff away
tucked away you can also see my sling
bag in the duffel bag I just keep it
there because I don't really have
anywhere else to like keep my bags and
stuff so that's what's for me right now
this copy didn't have a shelf but I
added this glass shelf into it just so I
could basically fit this thing perfectly
and to put new things on top of it but
down here is also a drawer and I love
this drawer because it has this clear
glass top you are be able to see it but
it has this drawer which I basically
keep you know jewelry that I don't
really wear that much but I still love
my sunglass is like little bags and
belts and a couple of hats as well and
then in here I basically just fold denim
jeans and t-shirts like the more casual
cool stuff are all in here and down here
is also casual
cool but maybe more summer stuff that
I'm not really wearing a lot at the
moment so over here is my dressing up
area I love this picture I bought this
in Hong Kong recently and I just think
it just kind of frames my room really
well this is my mom I've had this for
years you can see it's really old but I
just keep my you know my underwear and
stuff and my house clothing the stuff
that I just laze about in and like um
Jim wearing I also have my electronics
and tripods in one of these drawers here
over here you guys might remember this
from a hall I did as a TK Maxx Hall and
this is where I keep all my bracelets
and I have one of those little necklace
stands as well and I got this little box
from Birchbox actually but I think it is
from Muji I basically put just all my
rings my bracelets and other things just
over there so I could have easy access
and I'm not a perfume girl like if I use
my perfume I just hurry up and use it in
my bin it and I don't buy a new perfume
only if I get it as a gift so I just
keep a couple of my perfumes right there
on this corner and over here really is
it nothing besides really old candles
and this really cool thing that I bought
from Primark I'll show you it's cute
right and then I have couple of books
and magazines a lot of people do have
the Alexa draw I find it really useful I
do not use it to store my hoards and
hoards of makeup because I really don't
have hordes and hordes of makeup but if
you guys want to see it I'm gonna show
you anyway I basically keep products
that are new products I haven't used
before I just put them all in here in
here is also skincare but the skincare
in here is like skincare that I know and
I love when I run out of my main stuff I
then come in here and I take it and I
finish my stuff I tried to use things
over and over in here is like basically
makeup palettes eyelashes and stuff I
went to Asia so I've got lots of
eyelashes from my China
and the rest of my drawers are all
dedicated to hair product I have a lot
of hair products from Carol's Daughter
two bleachers for every time I think I'm
gonna do on brain and I change my mind
and finally this closet here which I'm
not gonna go through because there's a
point is basically my coats
my dress is fancy tops and stuff that
I'm not really wearing or very much off
so guys here we get to where the action
happens and the action I mean is making
me look good in the morning so the first
thing I'm going to show you is actually
my main makeup draw this is where 90% of
my makeup is as well as in the other
drawer but I basically try to organize
it in a way that I get ready in the
morning or how you prepare your face so
the first thing you probably do after
the cleansing would be to moisturize and
treat and use your sunscreen so over
here is my my daily moisturizers which I
switch up and my sunscreen but I've also
got my cleansers and my night oils so
that in the evening can come and sit
down here and just cleanse it all away
before I go to bed and then next I have
my foundations
I have prep and prying I just bought it
as a primer but funnily enough and
finding that my sunscreen is a really
really good primer on for some reason I
have my mac matchmaster this foundation
which is I see my favorite foundation
along with Make Up For Ever HD I'm a
color and 180 Kevin the Kuan concealers
in color 12 or 15 I always use that and
then obviously after foundation you'd
move on to your powders and your conceal
your powders your blushes your contours
so over here I have my powders a range
of blush is my Charlotte Tilbury
this is the cheap to chic swish and pop
blusher I love it it's really pigmented
and my buttery and high cream blush
really nice blush and then next would
obviously be moving on to the eyes so I
have a number of different eyeliner
that I love and my mascaras there
kalique mascara that's my favorite
favorite the skies well it's very very
good names have some sharpness and then
I also have I pencil so these are like
shadow sticks which I never used to be a
fan of but I absolutely love at the
moment cuz they have some really good
color payoff and stuff and then they
have three palettes that I use very very
regularly which is the Charlotte Tilbury
palette so Dolce Vita one my favorite
palettes NARS Coconut Grove in my crease
I do that almost every day and I also
have the nas Tsuburaya I love the colors
on my lid they're beautiful beautiful
beautiful and this palette is probably
one of my favorites it's hidden over
here it's this the Sigma and warm
neutrals perronnette this palette is
beautiful absolutely beautiful and the
color payoff is divine the next I have
my falsies so my Mac eye lashes in the
scuitto eye lashes my lash adhesive
lashes that have been used but I'm gonna
reuse and then I finally have things and
stuff for hair its combs it's hair pins
it's moisturizers and a couple of things
like that so this is you can imagine how
I get ready basically from left to right
every single morning
so moving on it is my cont brush and
lipstick collection but my brushes I may
need the real technique brushes and but
Sigma have some really really nice
brushes that I got with my palette and
they're like my favorite brushes these
one two to three brushes are amazing and
they also bought a an hour grass and
brush I haven't used it yeah it's too
beautiful to use and far too expensive
to use I got these little tubs and
containers from tiger
I think nice and narrow ones are really
cool and over here I just keep cotton
more buds so my top drawer is basically
my most favorite and my most expensive
lipsticks probably so non drugstore
staff and
some new tomforde lipsticks which I
haven't worn yet they've been sitting
there for ages
my Burberry lipstick wear cell Charlotte
Tilbury in the masks are kept in a corn
and some urban decay and a couple of MAC
lipsticks I'm getting off MAC lipsticks
nowadays because there's so many other
options out there so I really want to
try more stuff and I think Kevin Taquan
I've actually got probably my favorite
ones that I wear all the time and this
Charlotte Toby Goss is like my
favoritest so underneath that I have my
lip glosses and drops drugstore items or
some of them a drugstore and I also keep
my lip liners here I only really need
three lip three or four lip liners so
here are some more eyeshadow palettes so
when I do want to try something
different
I'll come here I have my Mac quad I
never use it and I also have this embark
which used to be my favorite crease
color but I really don't use it anymore
downtown Browns I love this palette it's
like a wet and wild palette and I've got
some Inglot colors that I bought last
year at IMATS never been used never ever
been used but it's beautiful
now here are like newer products
products that I'm yet to try it or want
to try this drawn saves like everyday
essentials so my Bioderma I use everyday
to cleanse I use of my African botanics
body butter on my hands or if I'm
feeling dry my doctor lip nipple balm
for dry lips amazing I use it all the
time though in this jaw is basically new
things that I haven't tried yet so and
I'm gonna try real soon and finally I
have my nail polishes majority of them
are Barry M or top shot but I also have
some Marc Jacobs ones and some sage fees
and some SD and some other random ones
so probably about 50 in total but I have
them elsewhere as well so this is my
main makeup collection
ladies and gentlemen so guys I really
helped you in joy

these room tools is that it gives you
ideas of maybe how you might do your
storage I love watching them myself so I
hope you did enjoy it as well but I will
