with me video I was in New York with
Birchbox for the past few days for
Fashion Week and I thought I'd go out
with the girls and have a great time
so I know it I look a little bit blue
it's actually my sunscreen but that's
fine I cover it up with my Kevyn Aucoin
concealer which I blend two colors
together for the perfect hue I love this
concealer because it gives me the
perfect warmth and is literally my
perfect skin tone I love it
so next I'm using my trusty match
masters Mac foundation which is an eight
point five I use this all over and you
guys know it's one of my favorites and
if you're wondering who's in the
background is the lovely really and Anna
so my brows I've changed a lot
there are a lot slimmer for me and I
don't highlight as much I think this is
a much more demure and elegant eyebrow
the next I'm using my powder which is
for Mac I love this this is new it just
gives me the silkiest finish ever so you
guys know I've got a fat head so I like
to contour I'm using the sleek kit in
dark and I'm also using a sleek blush
for my eyes I'm going totally neutral
you know I'm like it's literally gold on
the lids and a bronzy color in the
crease I also had the chance to go to
Sephora and I'm using this champagne
eyeliner that I bought for men and this
is the bronze color that I'm using in my
crease it's a really simple look but I'm
going for a bold lip so the girls and I
couldn't get this song out of our heads
can you guess what I'm singing because
I'm going for a bold lip I'm lining
first chestnut and this is literally my
most favorite color in the world at the
moment it's a gloss from Mac so for some
added dimension I'm going to contour a
little bit more I'm also going to
highlight for that glow you know girls
moving on to the hair it's a little bit
messy for now but I know how to
transform my hair I literally brush it
out and I'm trying to get some body way
so I'm going to curl it with my hair
straighteners and then I'm gonna
literally tease like mad
so this is where the fingering action is
needed
I literally play with it play with it
toss it and all sort and it gives me
lots and lots of volume and this move
coming up this is the move if you want
extra volume so that's my hair and face
done I'll move on to my outfit decided
to wear all black and mas a black is
just so flattering I ended up with a
basic vest and my leather trousers and I
have this perspective it is amazing and
it's from ebay recently bought these new
cutout shoes which are from and other
stories I love them
so guys that is my finished look I must
say we had an amazing four days and I'm
so grateful to Birchbox as well as Lilly
and Anna who literally entertained me
the whole time
when they hear a little bit more about
my trip then make sure you check out my
blog moments of Starcom we've got a post
all about it on their bloody raw song no
no you HOT nothing I think that was babe
that was pretty good
do it again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
