I've got this look for you now I didn't
really have any particular inspiration
or anything I was just going through my
makeup collection happening that was
sort out adding a couple of new bits to
it and I came up with this look I feels
kind of quite an Instagram II kind of
look kind of thing if you see what I'm
saying but yeah this is it it's really
quick and easy it's going to be a
voiceover because I didn't actually plan
on you know doing the video I just
wanted to test out a new set up see what
it looks like it turned out okay so much
he going to do this as videos I hope you
guys enjoy probably by the time you're
seeing this I'm on holiday so make sure
you are follow me on my Instagram which
is the Patricia bright and then my
snapchat which is Patricia bright XO I'm
probably Sun in it up right now this is
the tree just before hand and I'm one of
these people when like my if my makeup
and stuff and my house isn't sorted
before I go away
I literally just can't like handle it it
really stresses me out but it's all
sorted in eyes and I thought why not be
one face anyway guys I hope you enjoyed
this video and I'll see you all later
bye so I'm firstly starting off with
priming my face and I'm using the
invisiblur from Mourad which is really
good because it has an SPF 30 in it and
I'm moving on to my brows and I'm using
a brow gel because I've run out of my
brow pencils and brow pencils are my
favorite but I'm using the Anastasia
Beverly Hills dip down / made in a
chocolate
so normally when I do my brows I like to
do a line on the bottom a line on the
top and fill in my brows really don't
look the same so I've just learnt to
live with them and work with what I've
got
I usually then go in with a concealer
underneath I draw quite a thick line and
I kind of drag it down because it gives
me really defined brows
so I then when I'm with this foundation
which is from Clooney and I actually
fell asleep this was just before the
airport and I only had the chance to
have an hour's nap and had to just go
straight away to the airport I fell
asleep in this Foundation boy on the
plane when I got to the hotel and before
I had another nap and this lasted and
stayed flawless for 12 hours so I am
highly impressed with this and the color
is perfect did that I went in with the
Urban Decay weightless complete coverage
concealer and I really like this
concealer especially because I'm quite
oily I find that it really doesn't have
a lot of oil and stays really matte and
this brush is from bare minerals like
it's an amazing concealer applicator it
kind of gives me an airbrushed effect
and I'd like to put concealer on my
eyelids as well as they're a little bit
dark
so I go ahead and put some concealer
down the bridge of my nose just to add a
little bit of highlight it's the same
one and then to contour I'm using a
darker foundation and this is the double
we're in the color mahogany which I've
been using it to for like over a year
it's my favorite contour color I then go
ahead and use a buffing brush to blend
out all the harsh lines and just to make
it look a lot smoother and then I'm
going ahead with the sacha powder which
I took about all the time
under my eyes but I like to kind of Pat
it in rather than really bake it because
I think it can look a little bit white
and washed out
so for my eyes I'm using the Kat Von D
shade and light palette I just gone in
with the darkest brown in my crease area
on my lids I've gone for a dusty pink
shimmer which is actually from the Mac
warm neutrals palette so I don't
actually have the product shots I just
didn't have the time and I was exhausted
but hopefully this is useful enough for
you guys and I just Pat that onto my
dips you give me a little bit of a girly
shimmer
I then went in with a touch more of the
dark brown it should give me a little
bit more depth and then in my inner
corner I like to add a touch of gold
just to bring out my eyes a little more
and I've gone in with a black pencil
liner as well after that I go in with
some liquid liner and I'm using it the
maybelline i think it's called Inc
something and I am just terrible at
doing liner nowadays for some reason so
any tips will be useful and it takes me
forever to get it right now then I'm
going in with it miss hippy mascara from
a l'oreal which is actually really
really good just to coat my itty-bitty
lashes that are super curly
and then you guys are Milosh girl these
are from the law and I do have a coupon
code in the description bar below and
these are the winning ones which are
just light and fluttery which are
perfect for my eye shape so I'm using a
highlight from my sleek palette and it's
actually a blush but it's a gorgeous
highlight color and the blush is well is
gorgeous and it's in a color called
Amira so on my lips I'm going in with
the dose of colors liquid lipsticks and
the first clap I'm using is cork I
wasn't quite short on this and found it
in a little bit you know didn't suit me
so much on its own but what I did is I
combined it with a second one which is
called chocolate wasted and I think this
is great just to add a little bit more
shape and dimension to my lips and kind
of give me an ombre look
now once that dried I realized that I
needed a touch more of the cork I just
put that in the central area to give me
a little bit more dimension finish off
the look I'm just going to give my hair
a little brush and tuck it behind my
ears and I am wearing two packets of 18
and 20 and a closure for this kind of
full look and just for you guys I've got
an extra 10% off link in the description
bar below I look great oh wow really
good really good

question yes because obviously I was

age of 19 and I didn't have loads of
