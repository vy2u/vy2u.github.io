I'm gonna do something a bit different a
little bit auntie the wave of what's
going on because we know that
Valentine's Day is in the air and some
of you absolutely sick and tired of
hearing Oh what to care to go for
Valentine's Day
oh my god I did you know Oh fantastic
hey Valentine's Day makeup Valentine's
Day whatever especially for those of you
who don't have a Valentine's Day to
celebrate with but never fear it doesn't
mean that you can't enjoy your
Valentine's Day and get yourself some
gifts so I'm gonna give you a few gift
ideas I think it's great for a girl
who's single or someone who just doesn't
know what to do for Valentine's Day for
themselves because on my channel I don't
do feeling sorry for oneself we don't do
that on my channel no no no we are
fabulous we got free we are beautiful
whether we have someone or whether we
don't have someone so I'm gonna give you
a few gift ideas so number one this is
very much a Valentine's Day gift and
it's underwear people love you know
getting their partner's underwear or
whatever but get yourself some underwear
girls there is no reason why your
underwear should be all ripped and like
discolored and just wrong no go and get
yourself some nice and lacy underwear
something that makes you feel good
something that makes your outfits look a
lot nicer the censors got loads of sales
going on right now as they're in
administration go and pick yourself a
nice piece so that when you put it on
you're like damn someone's missing that
obvious give yourself a foot spa I've
seen so many feet that just look dry and
ashy and crusty or in the back is just
crack hold your foot should not be
crackle girls ladies and gentlemen no
don't do this go and have a look at the
back of your feet right now then looking
a bit tired then looking a bit dry they
look a bit cracked go and run yourself
one of those saltwater baths especially
if we can get some salt there's dead sea
salts they're amazing and some bubble
bath and just steam your feet get them
nice and comfortable this is something
you could definitely do on Valentine's
Day night and just you know do that get
yourself one of the foot scrubs and just
massage your feet
do your toes pay your little toenails
and just make sure that your feet look
presentable to yourself first or to
whoever may walk into your life and see
your lovely toes
next up the greatest gift I feel is
often being able to give somebody else a
gift so find one of your friends one of
your best friends one of the girls or
guys who've been there for you all your
life
have been there right now and I thought
ride or die and find that individual and
bless them with the gift often you know
you feel good about it whether they have
a Valentine's Day or not if you love
them they should be your Valentine's Day
and if they've been there I'm sure you
have a lot of love for them one thing
that's amazing is chocolates my friend
god I love Lind or anyone who knows me I
love a Lind or chocolate that's Swiss
crema chocolate get them a packet with
Lindor yes they will really appreciate
that get yourself some nice smelling
perfume and perfume is one of those
ideal you know gifts like Valentine's
Day gifts Christmas gifts but the thing
about perfume like the way things smell
can really really change up your
atmosphere and if you can go out I said
you know I'm gonna buy myself my own
atmosphere right you want something kind
of buzzy kind of you know snappy get
yourself a new scent to go by so this is
not a gift I think this is amazing for
Valentine's Day
decide what music you and then listen to
what everyone's listening to a bit of
Lionel Richie or some slow jams you
better find yourself some dub some grime
or some Pussycat Dolls okay you know
another song I'll definitely recommend
would be sway he's got this song called
what's it called still speeding Mac it
much yeah um you know that song gets me
really really hyped you just need
something a high-energy just to make you
feel like yeah I don't have a man and
what yeah that's what you need so get
yourself an item that you've wanted get
brush yourself with it if you don't need
anyone to bless you a gift bless
yourself that was so aggressive
but yeah bless yourself over gift guys
like a piece that you've been looking at
for a while
treat yourself to it now obviously don't
go far too far out of your budget but
you know just
a bit out of your budget you know get
yourself something really pretty and
just let you know I bought this for
myself on Valentine's Day okay
now the thing is with being single
there's loads of us out there go and
find yourself could be your other single
friends cuz I'm sure there plenty of
them go out and have a good time meet up
where you go show each other love go out
and dance the night away and probably
you'll end up finding someone else you
single maybe next year you'll have the
Valentine's treat yourself to like a new
hairstyle that's a lot I do why I treat
myself to new hairstyles like every week
I love like doing new stuff I've just
got this Bob now which I've discussed in
another video and it's just like it
makes you feel fresh it makes you feel
new treat yourself treat yourself to a
new experience something you've always
fought I'd love to try there it's a bit
weird it's a bit different
mmm that thing do it like whatever it is
treat yourself to that thing that you've
never done before that you've always
wanted to do you felt a bit nervous
about doing it and find a friend again
or do it by yourself and just go and do
that thing and you'll feel really
invigorated and empowered so guys I
hoped you liked that quick videos and
this is for my you know my single girls
who are out there who you know I don't
want you waiting on my videos I wish I
had somebody to share them and I said
get yourself your own Valentine's Day
gift forget you don't need a man to do
this for you enjoy yourself looking for
yourself
and whoever comes along will come along
so go search into that video bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
