to surprise trying to compose myself
right now and everyone welcome to my
channel my level of excitement is that
she peeked intensely I've been up since
5 a.m. today of the day about 20
launched in the UK all I know if I was
in a taxi at 6 a.m. and I made my way to
Harvey Nicks for a pre kind of opening
and where you could basically get a
first touch and look and feel of the
collection
thank God I went a little bit have you
didn't you don't even need to see that
like nobody needs to see that I went
home and I basically bought up the
entire collection
I bought it all I just bought it all I
just couldn't help myself
you know if you don't know you've
probably been living under a rock
Rihanna launched Fenty Beauty we've all
been waiting for this to drop and it is
here and it is arrived and it is looking
for mm obviously when the campaign video
went out everybody you lost that actual
minds like they're like a familiar face
is duckie hear me Anderson some the
other ladies I was just saying okay I
said take everything if they take my wig
take my koi just take it out take it out
oh I'm so Vienna has done now and I'm
just going to try and take this back a
little bit you know me I'm always on ten
I just want to be gone like seven right
now I'm not surprised that the
collection starts out with base so
foundation and concealers it's really
hard to get foundation right people have
been doing foundation for several
million years and they still haven't
gotten it right and Rihanna was like you
know I'm gonna launch with foundation
the hardest thing to launch with so for
that I'm very like yes you go go you did
you did yourself well and then there's
actually only one lip product again
which I thought was brave but I love
that about her there are lots of
highlighters that are just beaming the
level of Beamish is real there's also
brushes there's also a sponge applicator
there are also mini applicators which
basically look like Kim's full-sized
applicators I mean so we have full-sized
brushes and then these mini travel ones
as well I didn't pick this up because I
ended up spending too much money I was
like listen I've got to come home and
just control myself it was it was too
much let's talk in the press the
packaging it's just got that bad girl
RiRi right what not one
it's got just that effect you know it's
just really although I'll have a look at
this come on this is the sponge this is
the packaging I just think it's amazing
and then obviously you have the bag as
well and because I just got slightly gas
we also have this I don't know this if
this is going to be at every store but
actually I think it's only being sold in
Harvey Knicks in the UK but how cool is
that so the prices I saw are actually on
par with market rate for not high-end me
well yeah kind of higher makeup your
Lancome when my favorite foundations
it's not a drugstore price but actually
it's slightly lower price than map and I
feel like that was maybe a decision that
was made so the foundation was 26 pounds
which I feel like is slightly lower than
some of the other prices of foundations
which are about 32 pounds I don't know
what that is in American dollars at 34
$34 so and I was not mad at the prices
at all in store it just looks gorgeous
nice it was a vibe okay I've talked
enough
let's try product so this is the pro
filter instant retouch primer it's kind
of like Christmas I'm acting like I
didn't see this in store but when you're
here you're just pumping it the first
time your house no fragrance okay nice
and see if it's getting rid of my pause
slightly tacky slightly tacky yeah my
face does look a little bit more matte
doesn't it
okay I mean you don't really know until
you put your foundation and everything
on so we're just gonna go in with the
foundation so my foundation shade I
didn't get the chance to be shade match
there's a lot of people there but I
think my foundation shade is 450 oh my
gosh there's 40 shades
there's literally 40 shades of
foundation I mean there there are other
brands that has 40 shades
Lancome has literally 40 shades for us
more and shade matching but to start off
with 40 shades that is a lot just look
at the richness of that that is just
rich it's warm and it's a it's a shake
well I did not shake
I believe it's more of a mat
full-coverage foundation and I'm going
to go in with the full-bodied foundation
brush this is literally so soft so so
soft it's crazy so the foundation is
it's looks a bit not watery but it looks
like it's more of a watery base there's
no oil in this foundation I always stop
my chin area because it's a little drop
ya know I don't know if it looks a
little bit orange on camera but I'm
telling you that is soaking into my skin
I actually think this shade is a touch
duck then I normally would wear as a
foundation however I can bring it back
with my highlight and everything but
other than that this foundation it's
really flawless it really doesn't look
like skin just with I haven't used a
brush to apply foundation for quite a
while I will say though for me the
primer potentially could be doing a
little bit more when it comes to
blurring it isn't giving me that kind of
super blur effect I expect from a primer
I mean if you have like no pores and
you've got really flawless skin and this
is a great primer I need something
that's really gonna just you know just
really block it out okay so next up are
the match sticks amazing this so many
shades it's 20 shades of these match
sticks and these are the match skin
which are basically concealers and
contour sticks it's good so I'm gonna
use this to kind of highlight under my
eyes so the shade I got was latte again
there are 20 shades it is very matte
very matte I did notice that this is
definitely quite a neutral shade I love
the way they surprised because the when
it's not like this you're not going to
get that creasing do you know it goes
really well with the foundation it's
like the perfect from from my shade
anyway the latte goes really work with
the 4:50 and it's not
the yellow because I'm not gonna lie
sometimes I can look a little bit yellow
and then look at the beautiful end oh
look how thick it is so dinky I think
it's a perfect combination so you have
the brush for the foundation the dinky
sponge for under the eyes lets blend
this is beautiful
why is this carpet under my eye like
it's literally fits right under my eye
no this is some economics going on this
is literally going right in here has
done a really good job
this looks really natural okay I'm gonna
use another matchstick this is what I'm
gonna use to contour this shade is
called espresso now this was actually
the darkest shade and I felt like I
don't know how hot this is gonna be a me
I feel like it will be quite dark okay
yes jawline and here the jawline I've
been here two mini cakes recently that's
all I'm either dry or not that so it's
actually quite a warm contour it's not
cold it's a strong contour let's just
see how much product we have been here
people and this is thick this is thick
very thick a decent amount of product in
there it's magnetic didn't know that
how you gonna surprise a guy like this
how are you good this is amazing
it's just blunt blend out of our contour
in I feel like she's really full of all
basis all bases have been covered I feel
like I look really warm like just that
that really good good chocolate that I
went on holiday and I got myself the
freshest glow not that one I went on
holiday and I look ashy this is where
you get this is when you read tide be
firm body in the same week okay so there
aren't any
i shadow x' yep so I'm gonna just finish
my eyes and then we're gonna go in with
some highlight right I'm back with a
little bit of eye makeup you know
leaving off my hair a little bit more
and this is the stage that I'm actually
genuinely really really excited about
it's the highlighting stage to Lunas
fancy beauty has gotten ridiculously
hard at the highlighting there are the
matchsticks and these are the shimmer
skin sticks so creamy stick I'm gonna go
in with this shade called blondie whoa
every time that Patricia had to sing you
are gold it was right then it was right
then go and then I'm gonna just tap it
in with my finger because that's what it
says to do and this is quite creamy Wow
chicks come on somebody but it blends in
really well but it still just give me
one gentle you are gold papi it's a
gentle pop though you can wear this one
to work you know if you really don't a
blind people this is an option feel like
that's great to put on the tip of my
nose Oh bridge life snatch that bridge
this whole look is giving me very much
that modeled you like you know how yeah
I mean I'm used to literally looking
matte I put powder everywhere because I
wanna be like I wanna be like for men a
brick but with this it's like just
letting my natural beauty come out it's
a little bit like a cake let's just roll
away let's go in the next step is the
highlighters another highlighter these
are the kilowatts like kilowatt and the
shade everybody has been wearing is this
shade here called trophy wife this will
just bright this will brand your wife
this will bright hold on it's like a
gold bar you we need to say you are
Gold in slow motion you go this is
insanity okay if I'm gonna go in with
the 20 is the highlighting brush this is
the brush look at the design of that
super angled I just got sharp
you've got to be kidding me
this is against a we're just gonna take
it back because it cut it
this one is Wow Wow it looks like oh
okay you don't need a lot of this
Patricia's got to rectify it Patricia's
has got some what what happened not
slightly kind of doing just just a
little bit carried away I was and you
need to be confident in the product you
need to be confident in the product you
do not need to just get be cocky and
just go in there with your brush because
you will look like this I actually just
have had two baby wipe that away we're
just going to literally kiss kiss this
and obviously as you can see I'm kind of
doing it in the she--she which isn't how
I would normally do it however if we can
do it maybe she's just trying to teach
us something new you know she's that is
actually quite a lot of highlight of
like a lot beautiful diamonds diamond
shine baby when I'm feeling that this is
not everyday though I think you'd have
to go really gently to wear this
regularly 26 pounds for that highlight
arm tell me that highlight is going to
last you for years
oh yeah and little goes a long way but
it's beautiful
okay so next I am going in with the one
and only lip product which I'm surprised
by I was like why is it just the one but
you know Moore's gonna come I feel like
we definitely know more is going to come
and this is basically like a it's a very
natural lip gloss and you know my ashy
lips you know meet the gloss however
sometimes they need a bit of color
yes tis very rare for me
this smells divine Mitch it's not like
kind of watermelon I like watermelon
yeah
so I've got nothing under my lips I
don't have any lip liner I don't have
any color I've not seen my lips like
this from from since I was like 13 like
literally the days when my only makeup
was Vaseline and I would layer it on
this thick to the her lips they look
like sand not gonna lie this is very
very different makeup for me very very
different but I really like it it's a
much more natural beauty this is like an
enhancement it's not a transformation
it's an enhancement I'm just going to
come in so you guys can see like why I
look like up close and people we all
have real skin okay I have pores I have
a hairy faith it's very very normal I've
got a little bit of creasing under my
eyes don't let the internet make you
think that people like don't have things
on their face I have texture very normal
does it look different to my mom we'll
make up our hundred percent million
percent say yes it definitely does and
in a good way I'm kind of like okay this
is different I like it
there's a number one the primer for me I
eat a little more out of a primer it's
quite a moisturizing primer it doesn't
it's not a sticky primer and it also
didn't blur me and you know as I say
I've got pause and that kind of stuff I
want a little bit more blurring but if
you're someone who's a bit more of on
the dry side and you find that primers
are too dry for you that's definitely
definitely definitely an option
secondly the foundation I think that for
fancy beauty Rihanna to come out with
forty shades
Yoji you're a real G because if you knew
it was difficult and that was the
decision you made you didn't take the
easy road and I like that and I was
probably about I think there were three
other shades darker than me and might
have even been four shades and my shade
was 450 I actually think that I could
have gone a shade up because this has
kind of dried down a touch darker than
my normal shade but I do think it was
quite nice even with all the
highlighters and everything in so next
up is the matchsticks and it's the matte
skin and you know what it does what it
says on the tin however I did feel that
it was a little bit dry on application
but that's really good if you don't want
creasing and that kind of thing but it's
safe you have really dry under eyes or
like eczema around your eyes and you
will need to put your moisturizer on
underneath because it is quite a dry
matte formula but again if you are you
know greasy eyelid Queen then it's an
option again there are 20 shades of
those and my shape is very neutral very
very neutral I feel like it paired
perfectly with my foundation no no where
something a little bit more yellow but
as you can see this is not giving me my
crazy halo I like next match tips again
and obviously the highlighting ones nice
and creamy there's so many shades
there's a lot
it's an excited to try quite a few of
them I think the thing is is that no
matter your skin tone you're gonna find
one or two or three that you really like
for you so in my opinion like this oh
that's a lot there's a lot of these here
but I can understand the reasoning
behind it if you've got forty shades
it's 40 different women who we're gonna
want 40 different highlighting sticks
and colors to go with them then yeah I
get that entirely and now we come up to
kilowatt this is a kilowatt no
definitely
it's pigmented it packs a punch but it's
like crystally buttery smooth it's not
like glitter it's like mmm I can't
really describe it it's just a wow it's
just nice you know it's just nice and
then the lippy but live here I'm just
interested to see more shades I think
that this is basically potentially about
to trigger something different in Beauty
I think is very innovative in terms of
pairing it back letting women girls
whoever likes makeup to look more like
an enhanced version of themself it's
very natural it's very you know chewy
and glowy and I don't know if this was
what the brief was I feel like this is
what really went to Fenton was like you
know what I want girls to be beautiful
naturally I just feel like enhance
that's that's how it comes across I feel
like I do look good if I do sit with
them of them getting gas in myself
overall I am a happy happy bunny and I'm
I'm I'm just shocked I've been turning
my head I'm like sure
so yeah Fenty beauty my level of
excitement was real it did not
disappoint it is amazing you don't have
to bright everything you do not need
everything you do not need every
highlight because I've got a big gasp I
bought a lot of additional items another
killer what that I am tried oh it was
this one ginger binge a Moscow Mule
these two are the ones that I really
really like
from a pricing perspective I do not
think it's bad not bad at all so yeah
