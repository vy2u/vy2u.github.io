hello beautiful people welcome to my
channel I hope you are doing well I'm
excited as I always am because number
one Christmas is in the air and
therefore something works too early and
for some people I'm a little late but it
doesn't matter and what I wanted to do
is do an unboxing because I've got loads
and loads of PR and stuff to show you I
think I've even got some clothing
goodies in here I'm seeing lycra violin
so hey and if you're not subscribed make
sure you subscribe I have my social
media down below make sure you've all
follow me in my Instagram my Twitter

stuff for the Christmas season so stay
tuned for break first make sure you've
got your notifications on we're just
gonna get into it we're gonna have fun
like it's gonna be a jolly Christmas
okay hey bright yeah I'm slightly
overexcited as per usual so let's get
into this video this is so pretty
clearly it's a cute little bag but then
there's a ton of other stuff in it as
well it's a bit weird sometimes they
give me stuff I already have and they
know that I like so this is a take the
day off but I have like three of these I
use them all the time I think is that
they know I like it so they keep
stocking me up but there's some other
stuff in here okay aromatics in white a
perfume package is a bit weight it
doesn't look very finicky but let's
smell it it's quite strange not going to
like it smells a bit grandma and lovely
but it does smell a little bit grandma
like your grandma's under word or but so
no one had say 'under mojo clean clean
underwear drawer like fresh laundry
drawer okay
pet star hydrating moisturizers they're
really generous they get right they've
given me three of the same product these
are a hydrating moisturizer SPF 20
another moisturizer with SPF in it did
Patricia some Clinique
top-ups to2 giveaway goodies love bear
I knew it because I feel like why do you
accept at least if I already have to
give away okay so this is clearly for
you guys so what else do you have in
here
smart SPF okay okay dramatically
different moisturizing lotion as well I
don't think I have this bit I might just
keep that one for myself
okay sorry okay we have another one
another perfume in black a similar
packaging as well let's smell this
hopefully it does it's more like
grandma's underwear drawer no that
doesn't but it smells a bit a bit more
masculine and I get why it's in black I
think I'll just take my time to see fine
I like that more than the white for sure
but I am a Tom Ford black orchids fan
these are cute I've not seen these
before these I've not I've not seen them
I don't have those cute giveaway right
so another be getting fancy hello love
me oh my gosh the lip balm from Lemire
me oh my gosh I haven't ever had any
lemare products to be honest with you I
haven't really gone to buy any I have
seen them I've been really really close
to buying some but it's nice to get
products samples I mean they've given me
full-size products
that's amazing and a note dear Patricia
please find a clue some lemare
essentials for you to indulge in yes
it's an indulgence sweetie we have also
included the limited edition Christmas
oh okay this is the Lumiere I
concentrate oh listen if you guys don't
know I am a sucker I'm a sucker for pack
for packaging is no smell to it but I
feel it smells a bit like its sheer
butter base well that's quite thick that
is going on my nightstand thank you okay
hmm there are new oil we generate I like
to use a oil at night I've kind of got a
little secret recipe about I kind of
mixed up myself oh but look I shook it

a menthol minty smell we're gonna go in
because this is my Christmas present
okay yes oh it's very heavy this is from
nails in your killing it oh thank you
I've already got these I'm so so so like
honestly so so grateful I think I've
actually done a review of some of the
new makeup from incredible so maybe the
way across someone else authorities sent
me things I've already reviewed this is
a new makeup line from ink nails so they
have a new lipstick line and I think
they've got some liners and a couple of
different things this is a lot of
product this is the jelly shop that and
kind of snapped on me but I don't think
they will snap should surely test-retest
but as you can see it's got a little
grows inside it when I use it the last
time it kind of snapped right at that
point by feeding right there and I think
there's a little bit of a pressure point
but other than that I will say that I
will the lip in it lasted really well
I'm more one of their as their mapme
lipstick so oh this is cute though
glazing intense lip glaze and this shade
Oh double shot day oh this is a bright
intense red let's see how intense it is
on here okay you're cute and I have to
swatch one of these unicorn shade which
is actually very cute so those are the
shades as you can see that mad that

what is this liquid lipstick and
fragrance travel duo

don't need to do that but I'm not gonna
like this little perfume bottom is cute
