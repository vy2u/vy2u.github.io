nappy like unbelievable you cannot tell
me nothing is this the secret hello
beautiful people welcome back to my
channel I hope you are doing well I'm
feeling a little bit like a Latin Lover
today like with the red lips the black
Mina flouncy top
I like the jet-black hair I'm feeling it
like you know what hair colour genuinely
makes you feel like a different person
and I'm just like Morticia and they're
just extra swag and you know in today's
video as you can probably tell by the
title is going to be Olivia fashion
overhaul because it was six months ago
when I first purchased on fashion over
and when I first did the I spent series
I've been doing is only six months ago
it's crazy right
and I can I bought stuff on the website
said I've heard about it and I just seen
it around and you know to me out like
this is where you get your items that
are kind of sleazy you know and I spent
my money my first encounter wasn't
amazing I definitely found I had items
that were hit or miss and then on my
second encounter
I always he went to LA and I got some
stuff and I'm not gonna lie it was
really really nice so I did another
order by myself just to see what I could
get this time around and just get it
shipped over from you know the states
and just see how my process was and you
know what it was it's so far everything
so right now I have had messages from
you guys I read my messages on my
Instagram and my snapchat on my Twitter
please do follow me if you're not
following me already but I read messages
of people who've messaged me and said
they ordered something that was out of
stock and instead of being given a
refund they were giving gift vouchers
and I also know that they don't do
refunds they give people back gift cards
so my advice is like if you are going to
purchase don't buy too much and just be
very short of the items so that's just
one of the things that I wanted to say
but recently I don't want it just to be
you know
sexy you know I'm gonna enjoy my body a
little bit more I think it's why I also
had a baby and stuff like just like I
just felt very frankly but this season's
been the season of bougie thought and
I've just so you know I'm gonna be sexy
and when I think of sexy I do think of
fashionable I'm not gonna die so I
bought some good like stuff that would
be good for New Year's party season and
just so you know just increase the sexy
items in my wardrobe because it was
looking a bit thin and there's too many
jumpers in there you know too many
jumpers and druggin bottoms and I'm like
no so let's see what we got let me just
have a look I've got some goodies some
fashion over I I can't lie I do think
that the Christmas package it looks
amazing what we're gonna do is we're
just gonna try it on and see what we've
got
so it looks like we're starting the wall
with a bang this is what I'm seeing is a
lot of shining shining hello crystals
this isn't bad though I wonder what this
looks like
Wow I'm not even gonna sing it I'm gonna
let you guys sing it for me but you know
look at the way the dress is sparkling
and good to read this is a really nice
party piece look at this without being
trashing could you know like you know
there's a balance you know there's a
palette this is really nice I love this
and this is $44 which is about 35 pounds
listen you never know oh my gosh I
really like how that look how nice does
that look yes I love this I love it yes
well do the one where you pretend that
you're walking just chillin in a hotel
lobby in a hotel you're not staying at
yeah I got this dress I think it's even
a little bit bright I need it to be
darker so you guys can literally see how
amazing this looks it's so nice oh so
nice I feel like this is going to be my
New Year's dress New Year do you meet a
it's actually quite nice quality and
quite nice material what is this a
sequin dress oh it's very small
39
$99 not gonna lie it does seem a little
bit flimsy but you know what the style
is cute this is one I need to see on
it's very small very very small I like
the color this kind of would have looked
good when I had my red hair this would
have been very pleased in IBS and
sequined I find it to be very shortly I
mean it's different for everyone
depending on your body shape but for me
this isn't this isn't me this is giving
far too much it's too short too low too
much arms and like my rule is like show
some not everything or like kick
something to show well this is just
showing everything the principle is nice
though oh okay this is a little combo
that I picked up these white trousers
that they were like wide leg trousers
and then this yellow top and I saw it
styled like that on the website these
are not bad oh and I saw it styled with
this top okay this tops a lot cheaper
than I thought it would be it's just a
little t-shirt material let's try it on
anyway guys you cannot tell me nothing
right now my gluteus maximus has done
zero work and it is in pancake territory
right now but in these trousers its
lifted from the shadows
I love this is enough good thinking
fashion over I have to show you the
bottom I have to just show you the
bottom oh my gosh they're really nice
these are an amazing pair of trousers
this is a look please believe that these
white trousers of $32.00 they're really
really really really really really nice
quality and not even joking I live for
these the top is $19 and I'm not gonna
be like it's really nice material it's
not it's actually quite thin and flimsy
but it looks cute realistically it
should be more like a $10 for this top
but that's because I've got cheap
nowadays but I feel like I look like I'm
up at least a hundred and fifty dollars
don't you think I pick these up I pick
these up because I needed and it will
help with the booty I wanted to see if
they actually worked and fashioned over
has these as well as you know that like
stick on boobie things and got all of
them so you know I'm gonna do I'm gonna
put these on under my outfit and see if
it makes any difference and then I've
got this dress here which is like an
itty dress but this is $27 it looks
really cute for one shoulder or I can
tell I can tell I'm gonna love this oh
my god it looks like I'm wearing a nappy
what can you guys see that oh my god it
looks like a depressed pea what that is
abnormal is this what people do is this
the secret I've even got a big like five
fat like you'll it I did to the booty
and it's just he's so weird like I'm not
the man I don't have a little booty I'm
very straight from the front I am
married to shape at the front like mmm
but from the back and I've got a little
something because this looks like an
actual Jo I actually can't decide if I
like or hate it it hurts blood
circulation al blood circulation cutting
off unbelievable
do you know what this is gonna stay in
what they say
water therefore like Valentine's Day you
know when I want that extra curse to be
popping for the bay not gonna lie
looks like I'm actually wearing a nappy
like you know it is it's the side to but
ratio it just isn't right like fights
should it be so thin with the bomb just
going bloop I mean it depends some
people are naturally born with it you
don't - fashion over this dress is
actually quite nice but this is the same
material as like the leggings I have the
leggings but actually we're quite
regularly it's the exact same like jog
am like Nagini material and it looks
nice on E
that's always settle it in it makes you
look cute I love the one-shoulder this
was $27 so actually isn't too bad ease
and make really really really expensive
I feel like it does look nice on as well
I don't know what in God's name this
even I do not know what this is let's
just get the velvet down and one tea
katsu on this is all wrong I feel like a
you know to be completely honest it
didn't even look good on the girl on the
website and you know she had the perfect
body to make this work I don't know who
would be wearing this penis inducing
outfit
anywhere I kept you know what I always
say that but there's gonna be one goal
he's gonna wear it and kill it and then
you know I look like a sack of taters in
this that's fine like I look like candy
floss sack of potatoes with a floating
head but someone else is gonna kill this
and look fire I do not the fire and I
definitely have a little pouch for the
penis which which we don't have seven
yeah I feel like I look like a very
inconspicuous super villain night dude
dude dude funny enough the felt but
actually quite nicely it's made of okay
so over here I have a bodysuit
nice let me see what I can wear it with
how much is this this was only nine
dollars 99 and it's actually really nice
material really nice and then I picked
up these trousers over sighs zipper
pants it was doing so well but look at
the size of those zips they look like
zips that are made for someone with
gigantism they're huge
let's see what it looks like on whoa
this is what this looks like on and what
I hate is this these gigantic gigantic
zips they're like so big no one needs
it's as large as this but the trousers
are phenomenal please note I do have the
pants on here and I think in trousers it
looks even worse but look how my bum
looks in this my glittery vanellope so
yeah and it makes me kind of in them
even more here but besides that I think
the trousers are quite nice ignoring
this and this is just a really nice body
suit and it puts to the wind today
you'll be fine you'll be fine
free the nipple hashtag it's just a
really nice little what they could say
race the top I think it looks really
nice with the trousers this is the thing
with fashion overwrite you have to take
your time you don't have to pick up the
items that are not for you find the
items that are for you which is what I
did this time and I'm living for it I am
New Year's ready I'm gonna just take off
these shorts and then just see what my
normal booty looks like okay this is
what it looks like normally much better
not a letter P just just simple how I
like it okay next start could they let
them know skirt Wow
I like that so here's this go on it's
just a little pencil skirt it's actually
quite nice I really like the light
metallic effect is like a pic pinky
metallic I have to show you guys up
close it's just a little pinky metallic
skirt I think it fits really nice my
booty is poppin I'm loving it it fits
really nice and I think it really looks
nice with this top as well all together
I feel like this is really a look I love
it
2018 we're ready so Vista at chip
like so pissed about it that is Patricia
all over yes let's go this is super
giving me a minor communist got a little
breast carp here a little side hip curve
here my hip is hurting but you know okay
we have another piece here whoa there
ever was a shining shining it is here
this is shining shining and your gold
all in one jumpsuit listen I need
glasses let's try this on wow this is a
shine of here this jumpsuit on it is
really a while it is really really
really oh wow it is it too bad it is a
little bit racy it's a it's a little bit
shiny shiny this is what you're wearing
in like Vegas you won the strip you want
to shine this is what you wear I cannot
be wearing this in the middle of London
right no no no like no but it's a nice
little piece not the shiny party piece
this is a velvet dress velvet queen oh
okay how do you wear this okay seems
simple enough looking a little bit low
in the V area this might be cute I like
the mint for this
I do like clothing that's a little bit
long on I'm gonna have the sensor the
middle of this again it's just boobies
to the winds not nipples to the wind
boobies to the wind just very open like
the back is really open as well I love a
low V that's fine but this is just
boobie nipple everything to the wind
funny enough I really like the fit of
the dress I like the material
I like the fabrics it's kind of got a
little bit the galaxy effect going on
but the fact that you can see my areola
and all of my milk ducts is like no but
I do think that if you don't like
smaller boobs or like a flat chest or
like boobs at one like mine it could
look good on you and oh oh this is so
adorable hi darling
yes darling what did you sit in the
middle
so unfortunately this dress is one of
those examples of far from the reality
this is $99 and it does not fit like how
it fits on the model on the website on
her it goes in it goes out it is banging
on me it looks like a bin liner with a
dead birds coming out of it
unfortunately you know what on that on
the gram on the photo it looks so
fantastic it's like super smashing maybe
I just need to get like a really extra
extra small or something but this is a
small I mean it's it's meant to look
like this like if I put it on an it look
like this how amazing but instead it
looks like this well okay let me give
you guys my final thoughts okay guys
that is my fashion overhaul what did you
guys think I feel like I am glam ready
and this dress this is gonna be my new
year's dress I think I'm in love I'm
literally in love I really think it's
really really nice my overall thoughts
and I feel like I've not come 360 but
I'm a little bit of a fan I do like
fashion oh I thought I bought in and
when I first you know came on to it I
was a bit like this is a bit of an
Instagram brand like is it any good and
like oh you see loads of famous people
wearing it and that kind of thing and I
like being paid to wear it which a lot
of them were and which I totally get and
stuff what I found is that I've actually
continually worn the items that I bought
on my last two videos which are from
fashion eyes are from the jeans to some
of the dresses to like some items that
have worn holiday and I feel like I you
know as much as I was able to kind of
make a little joke out on that items
some of them are really really nice and
I think the best thing to do is just
take your time when you're shopping on
the website
do not go crazy do not go ham right
don't follow my example
okay do understand and you need to get
you know your sizing don't just get
something look at the price of the item
look at the material of the item because
they do not do refunds I ordered and I
absolutely fine and I've ordered three
times now
and always receive my stuff here in the
UK probably takes about 14 days to come
and I don't know what they do but I
never get a ship in charge so that's
kind of cool that has been my personal
finding yeah that is it really I don't
know what video I'm gonna have next for
y'all but you will see me very very soon
so if you're not subscribed subscribe
and make sure you're following my social
and in the meantime I'll catch you later
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
