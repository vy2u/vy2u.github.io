kind of a out for the day or how do I
wear it and what I'm talking about is
actually this metallic jumper that you
may see me wearing I hope it comes out
metallic on camera it may be a bit
overexposed I don't know some of you
probably have seen this in my whole
video and they thought okay how would
you wear that so I'll show you a way
that I wear in the day or wear with this
I think it is quite flamboyant of an
outfit but you know depending on how
you're feeling you could go ahead and
we're a high knee silver jumper if you
feel like it which is what I do I've
paired this with my leather skirt and I
thought that was really on trend for
this season metallics and they're all
together with a pair of flats just to
dress it down and a little bit
the Second World War this was with a
pair of high-waisted tailored pants and
I thought that's a great way to dress it
up for an evening now and with some high
heels and like a little cropped like
bolero as well to kind of add a bit of
flavor and a bit more color to it the
pants were actually Navy but kind of
looked black really so if you have a bit
of brightness to it that just adds a tad
of color to add to the monochrome look
I will say that the metallic trend is
really easy to pull off you just don't
want to go like shine bling bling
everywhere and you can kind of get them
telex that suit your skin tone so if you
really want to go for over more you know
warming effect you can go for gold kind
of metallic if you want to go for
something cooling if you go ahead and go
for a silver metallic kind of like this
gentle but no one wants to know it's
from H&amp;amp;M almost $25 a really quick pair
and video I hope you enjoyed it have a
look more different parents coming up so
Fanta watching bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
