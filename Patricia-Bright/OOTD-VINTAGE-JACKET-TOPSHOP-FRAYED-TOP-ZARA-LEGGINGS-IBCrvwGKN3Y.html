video is gonna be a really quick outfit
of the day video I've not done with
these been about eight months now and I
really want to get back onto it a lot of
people ask me to do lookbook so I'm
gonna be doing a lot more lookbook say
stuff like that so we can kind of see
what I've been wearing so I'll get onto
this outfit as quick as possible because
I can talk forever I'm wearing a vintage
or secondhand corduroy
barbar camel and quilted jacket I love
love love this jacket because it is
different in so many ways one it is a
quilted jacket but - it's in the camel
is very rare to find it in the camel 3
it's in a court and 4 it is vintage or
secondhand and wearing it with my
Michael Kors watch which is the only bit
of Roebling I actually don't mind
wearing it so I'm wearing it also with
this Topshop cutoff top this top which
you should be able to see I'm gonna
either have a haul video I'm gonna have
a whole video up it's really cute Aztec
top the pattern on the top is really
really cute
they're like blue and it looks a bit
rough earrings are some rusted clip-on
earrings and rusted because I choose it
to be losted I'm not interested in like
in a blue jewelry or anything I learn it
thinking that's good
and I remember there were some really
cute leggings some old leggings that
I've got from Zara I've had these for
ages and the really cool thing about
these is that they've got really nice
suede on the inner leg like they're very
different I'm a belly buttons on the
show yuck gross I pull it down and I run
it with these really cute shoes from
Zara these ankle booties which I have
had for ages I think I bought it
December 2009 I love these I love the
bottom I just love the way they look
they're just gorgeous I'm going out in
Shoreditch actually
some French for some drinks full so guys
that is my outfit of the day I hope you
enjoy bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
