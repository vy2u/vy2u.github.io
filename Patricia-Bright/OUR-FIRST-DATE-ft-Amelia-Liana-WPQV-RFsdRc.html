still take it hey guys welcome to my
channel I am sure everything looks quite
different I'm here with Amelia decided
look at it the first day tagged because
we've never done this before I was
tagged by Barbara and I was like yes
finally I'm gonna do it I thought I'd
definitely bring Amelia on to do this
and they're gonna do a tag on her
channel as well but you've not looked at
a time oh yeah we're doing the bridge
time it's a sad day yes today
how long does it take you to get ready
for a date probably about 14 minutes I
don't get like it doesn't take me much
longer than normal getting ready I don't
that might including shower maybe
including shower maybe an hour yes I do
like to have a nice and it smell good
yeah thanks bro yeah like moisturize
yeah do that and then like makeup and
then actually if it's an outfit that
I've not planned it will take me a lot
yeah but I will end up with like a whole
wardrobe away so I would actually plan
my outfit the night before or the week
before actually yeah that's what I do
I'd say the same especially if it takes
like drying my hair that sort takes the
longest like that doing my hair will
take a good half an hour and then the
getting ready will take so would you
wash your hair like fresh for a day or
would you that have day um no I'd
probably like do it the night before
because it just takes a lot what is your
idea of a perfect first date dinner
drink cinema or adventurous date I think
when you're first starting to get to
know someone you know it's nice to like
have something kind of a bit more casual
like a dinner and then once you've like
gone on a couple dates and you kind of
have got over that like first onion
level of go into the convinced they are
together I might get to know each other
on that level and adventurous date would
be my worst like what hands what kind of
adventure if it's like climbing or
I don't know do something no that would
be horrible because I'd be squealing
like the bike we're gonna climb this
mountain no I would never do that I
think mine is like probably drinks
because you can get a bit drunk and then
you feel a little bit more relaxed it's
a little bit more casual
what would you gravitate more towards to
wear on a date jeans trousers skirt or a
dress I am a girly girl so I will always
wear a dress like I always wear dresses
especially if there's gonna be a guy
there my guy there yeah I would wear a
dress I can't think I definitely wear
either skirt or dress yeah yeah
just the cutesy and girly also kind of
depends where you're going for me yeah
and a more than like obviously wouldn't
walk out the door I still would dress in
here I would still do it cuz it you know
I want to look feminine okay and I'm a
girly girl so yeah it's like I don't
have to get used to that bite from
straight off the back of the knee
yeah not holding anything back no I'm at
my day what choice of makeup would I
make doll next door smoky and sexy bold
lip or brights I would go for go next
door because I think that if you if
you've got loads and loads of makeup on
a guy's just gonna be like oh my gosh
but rather just look a little bit more
natural so he's used to like my natural
face and then when it's like other dates
that I can show him a smokey eye but I
think for the first day he needs to see
me looking natural so he knows that Mike
I'm naturally okay looking I definitely
wouldn't go for a bold lip was just I
think guys don't like bold lips that's a
room I heard like yeah I think I want to
it's just like no good especially for
trying to kiss someone they don't know
where it's gonna go I don't kiss on the
first date
you gotta work with that oh yeah maybe
if he got any ideas he's thinking I
can't kiss you you got lipstick oh yeah
thing like that your date says you have
half an hour to be ready what do you do
I'd say yeah yeah yeah and then I'd
still take a little bit faster but the
reality is I'm probably gonna be late
anyway yeah don't give me half an hour
to get ready didn't happen to me before
and then you're like oh my gosh yeah
dry shampoo like makeup like it can be
done your date asks for the bill do you
offer to pay with actually meaning to
pay make a fake fast with no intention
of painting but experts him to pay
straight away I always offer to pay yeah
I think it's like in this day and age
and that kind of fair hopefully it's
just like no but you offer to pay I pay
really meaning there's like multiple
occasions where like guys guys I think
like that idea yeah I just say yeah cool
oh nice this girl do you like sit there
on the bill and while the bills arriving
in this minute no yes like never do that
like you're gonna pick no never do that
I always offer to pay with the intention
of paying because yeah in reality is if
you go on more dates their likelihood is
that you know he'll be the guy broke on
the first day I'm thinking oh my gosh
she's so expensive so definitely always
pay on the first date okay it's time say
goodbye and you really like your day oh
do you wave hug kiss on the cheek pack
full of smooch you've already said you
don't get enough there's no fool on
stage yeah I'm good so I wave so I can
imagine me waving but ideally I'd like a
hug and a double kiss yeah okay kid
about that like am I good yeah but like
initiation from the guy to be like oh
yeah totally but what if he went in like
I mean look going for the cheek and he
went for that what does he do
I'd still like do the Didache thing you
wouldn't like back away and then that
would be really no I'd just be like and
like push my cheek okay fine that's a
good idea that was how you have to
protect yourself from first date kids so
guys that is the end of the video we're
gonna text some people down below don't
put on a media channel we have the
British tag and yeah that we're gonna go
and do that and we're gonna get some
teeth some teeth some cold tea because
