still here in New York everything and
this is probably the first half of the
day that I've done since I've been here
I recorded some other ones but with this
thing about leadership because I was
just you know rushing and stuff like
that but yeah I'll show you before I
show you what I'm wearing today it's
really hot it's really hot and humid
here and the only thing you can wear is
nothing just glass so make it and you'll
be fine
other than that you're going to be hot
but yeah I'm just wearing you can't see
it completely I'm sorry there's nowhere
for me to record here but I'm wearing
this beep now I need other thieves
because they're just made of fabric and
it's just got jewels all over it and it
makes this casual rest
all of the sudden look quite hmm quite
doughnut stuff like that I'm wearing it
with high-waisted and vintage shorts and
these only cost me 3 pounds through my
50 than they're in cocky a lot cocky and
I wear it just like that so this is how
this outfit looks and went with these
tables like this it's just a really
quick color of the day this mess is from
Primark is really loose tiered really
really breezy really really nice and
really comfortable so you know in this
new yorky is a really hard to feel
comfortable you're wearing but I feel
like with the shorts whose top nothing
dry fitting and
because it so casual all the bit really
dresses it right they can't so guys
that's my outfit of the day and
hopefully I'll do some more and show you
a bit more what I'm doing right here
over people who asked why am I here I'm
here I'm training I work for a company
from there's a huge company you don't
need to know the company I work for but
yeah I work for me and then spend to us
there's about 160 of us who they sent to
New York to train now it's not really
training because they've actually just
having fun partying in all that jazz so
yeah that's really what I'm doing no
nothing like I've got an example Friday
next week so yeah that's the reason I'm
here I know you know a spy
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
