video is going to be a week in my work
wardrobe and you guys like in the past
I've done these videos and they've been
really popular and I realize that people
are just looking for ideas of outfits
they can wear like on a regular basis so
hopefully this video can do that and I
wanted to give you a little career
update or work update so prior my MOT my
previous videos were based on the fact
that I worked in the corporate world I
used to work in investment banking and
then I moved on to working in consulting
investment banking consulting and up
until about two thirty two months ago
and I've now moved into something that I
am much more passionate about and
probably more of a creative person and I
am a financial person although I still
have my financial head and my business
head on me however I now work in
basically advertising and on my video
content so heavily heavily related to
YouTube heavily related to the creative
world is also a business element and a
commercial element that really appeals
to me so and that is what I'm currently
doing and I must say I've it sounds
really corny but I think this might be
my dream job I think the fact that I'm
doing things I really enjoy doing and
I'm really passionate about doing the
fact that I can wear almost whatever I
want to wear it's just really really
cool to me so I just thought I'll show
you a few of my like outfits that I wear
and to work and I hope you enjoy don't
forget guys I will be doing a meet-up on
Friday the 21st of June and at
Selfridges so do try and come down and
remember to follow me on Facebook and
Twitter and Instagram and then I'll give
you a bit more updates on the details
but I hope to see you guys really soon
hey guys so this is Monday this is day
one look and I'm just wearing a t-shirt
which is from Primark and overall step
which is from Topshop and it does have a
little bit
on it so it depends on where you work
but I can get away with it because it's
kind of an environment where you can get
with some stylish elements but you can
always change it for a pencil skirt or
another like a line skirt without all
the details of it and this is basically
my everyday bag this a week from Zara
and you guys are seeing this loads of
times it's great and I'm just wearing
some flat dolly shoes today because I'm
not going to wear heels and that's
today's look so this is the top which
I'm wearing which is from Primark and
you can kind of see this neckline here
it's really really cool
it's like applique beading I love these
tees from Primark from the top pounds
and here's the skirt I'm going to tilt
the camera so you guys can see so this
is the skirt are closed as well and it's
kind of short and wearing black opaque
tights and they're quite thick though
these are my shoes and my bag and this
is today's look clearly this eye looks
darker because there's no light on that
side but yeah this is a look of the day
which will be the look every day because
I really don't change my makeup very
much for work hey guys so day two and
it's a Tuesday look for me you guys know
I love wearing dresses so this is a
bodycon dress which is from misguided
and it is quite short but I wear it with
quite opaque tights so I think it's fine
in the office and it's got these little
it's all leather details on the collar
and on the cuffs but I'll show you those
in a minute but obviously to make it
look a bit smarter I'm a red blazer so
I'll show you what it looks like with my
blazer so you can see it looks a lot
smarter and we're going blazer which is
from Topshop so I'm coming in that you
see what a moment the shoes are the same
as yesterday and the bags the same as
yesterday as well so here is the
dress-up clothes and that this is the
Blazer which is a dark grey and they can
see it's got these really cool leather
lapels and smoky in the pearls it's kind
of
color and then you can see my sleeves is
rather kind of another you see the
dresses call it body con but I think
it's absolutely fine I will
you know just pop a blaze born and stuff
like that that's it guys I'll see you
later bye so guys this is day 3 and this
is like my favorite getaway look because
I'm actually wearing jeans and a vest
but I always say a blazer is a lifesaver
because you can wear a blazer on top of
something basic like a jeans and a vest
and then it looks really like you know
sophisticated for those of you who can't
wear jeans to work just you know swap it
for a skinny trouser or a drainpipe
trouser and you can get a nice little
corporate look that's really casual
because this is what these look like so
you I don't think I'll take off my but I
would not take off my blazer obviously I
work but if you wanted to and a little
cardi on the inside would be absolutely
fine I mean you like this look every
time I can show you guys so you guys
probably saw this place yesterday
that's what it looks like it doesn't
have any the petals but it's a really
nice fitted shape that's what it looks
like at the back and this is a long my
dirt bag down this is like a long drapey
vest which I really like I've just
ruined this necklace as well because
it's not too much but it's kind of
sophisticated fashionable at the same
time these are my jeans are just some
basic black skinny jeans which are from
Dorothy Perkins it's all they like these
are the shoes these are my slingbacks
which are from Zara
and these are the shoes that have got
amazing toe cleavage like that if you
can see there's some great toe cleavage
going on there I love the color I really
neutral and actually really comfortable
I look for quickly show you my earring
you guys are not a massive earring wear
but I quite like these and then again
make you look quite sophisticated so
yeah that's it
these are from JustFab so like that's
today's look and I'll see you tomorrow
hi hey guys it's Thursday today and it's
another jeans day like I won't lie
Dean so that they're comfortable but
I've put some pyogenes on just to add
some and disaster it and another one of
these
Primark tops a really nice fabric
t-shirt shape with a bit of detail on
the neck and I can show you that but my
mark will cause what's wrong or that I
kind of wear this every single day and
I'm wearing sandals hopefully you guys
can see because they usually help make
like the jeans look smarter this is the
Blazer that I'm wearing with it it just
you know just add a bit more color makes
it a tad bit more smarter so is the
t-shirt and you can see it's got the
really cool like balls on the neckline
that's really cool when these earrings
again because if I'm wearing my hair up
then earrings usually do help this is my
blazer making kind of squinch up the arm
just to make it look a little cooler and
this is my Michael Kors watch it's like
three tone cause watch which love so
this is my Jean but I'm as well let me
show you my sandals guys these are the
sandals you can see okay guys I'll see
you tomorrow bye hey guys so last day of
the week this look is very casual cool I
must say it's not like them it's like
small outfit but whatever and I'm
wearing like a really baggy t-shirt that
I've had I bought this like four months
ago I've never worn it I pulled up the
label this mine I'm gonna wear this
t-shirt even though it's black but I've
got this cream skirt which is from
Primark
the t-shirt is from Topshop but I just
like how big the sleeves are and how
drapey feels really comfortable and nice
and if you can see my shoes from there
but um it's these really cool shoes is
all from primer so you can see the
details of the t-shirt is kind of
see-through but it's not to see through
at all
it's fine I can wear I could wear a vest
underneath but I'm not even going to
bother wearing a vest underneath and
I'll show you this skirt it's actually a
cream but it's quite bright and by the
wind over it's not too rre
but it's okay and you might be able to
see if I knock it down the exposure a
bit
yeah it's got these like bubble details
on it this is the belt that came with it
and it just cinches it in a bit because
it is quite big for me but yeah that's
what that looks and it's a really warm
day today as well so I thought I could
get away with this skirt so this is the
Murray James that they're so comfortable
like ridiculous it's like having your
feet and slippers so I absolutely love
these so guys thanks for watching my
week in my water and I will see you guys
later bye okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
