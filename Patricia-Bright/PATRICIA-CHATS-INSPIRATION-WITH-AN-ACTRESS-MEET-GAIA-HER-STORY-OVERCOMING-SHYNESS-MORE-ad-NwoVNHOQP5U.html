video is a little bit different I have a
lovely guest here
this is Gaia we actually met on the set
of a new show that's coming out on Sky
Bar and it's called you meet and the
apocalypse and I have a really small
little role to play but guy is like an
amazing main character and I thought it
would be really amazing just to bring
her over here especially because we're
in the back-to-school season I was
talking a little bit about careers and
development and you're an actress
obviously I feel like it would be really
great just to get your story
find out a bit more about the show and
then how you got to be where you are
just as some inspiration to some of you
guys who are maybe thinking about the
creative industry or just want to know
you know what the options are out there
for you so I've got loads of questions
on my phone here and I'm gonna ask you
as many as you let me yes no worries I
don't if you want to introduce yourself
and just say a little bit about who you
are from what you do well first of all
thank you for having me here nobody's
really coming yeah my name is Gaius Koda
Lara I was born in Naples
my father is Neapolitan and my mother's
American we've got Caribbean background
and Native American yeah I lived in
Italy until I was 10 years old and I
moved to New York and from 10 to 19
years old I lived in the Bronx so yeah
it wasn't very different from Naples
yeah but I definitely learned a lot and
I really think skin and shout out to the
Bronx cuz there's loads of people from
New York who is and they'll get very
excited they say we're friends of mine
from high school yeah yeah absolutely
and yeah so from there I chose to move
back to Italy and I actually started to
get myself out there through the web
with web series online in Rome with very
young directors and screenwriters and
actors and
together my my first really important
webseries was stuck The Chronicles of
David Raya Arif to buy even see mr.
Feeny and that was sort of what
catapulted me quickly give me - yeah
into the TV scene in Italy as well and
then from there through agency I got the
audition for humanity apocalypse
so webseries is kind of what you started
out with absolutely this so much
opportunity there is so much opportunity
we have to create it for ourselves yeah
you know there are young people young
creative people that can't find the
space to express themselves so online
the web YouTube has been a tremendous
medium for people to get their work out
there so I can only thank the youtubers
yeah thanks and jumpstart my career that
is amazing right so I think it'd be nice
to get a bit more about your journey and
how you got to where you are today and
any advice you might have for some young
people who are thinking about a creative
career so could you give us a bit of
insight into your journey I think what's
the most important is to just keep your
eye on your goal and not let go of it
and not allow anyone to tell you that
you're not capable that you're not good
enough that you're not beautiful enough
that you're not you know any of that
it's just it's it's difficult because
you're on your own out there so you have
to rely on yourself and you have to be
strong and you have to be prepared you
have to study yeah you have to focus you
have to be disciplined I think all of
these things are very important and yeah
and there's really nothing that can
stand in your way except for yourself if
you can never slack off you can never
feel like although I've arrived it's all
good it's really not because the
competition is very very high but did
you go to school or did you study to be
an actress I I didn't hit the curd until
I was in college because I was very very
shy when I went to college I studied the
theatre for three years and that sort of
gave me a base then I had a better
understanding then okay if I if I
prepare myself a bit but I also rely on
life experience to give me - to know
what to do eventually when I find myself
on set and there's nothing better than
actually being on set that's where you
you will truly learn we are throwing
into the deep
you've got to perform absolutely yeah
absolutely that's when you you know you
have to rely on your skills yes I needed
to get a little bit of studying a little
bit of training and some some input from
professors as well to understand am I
going in the right direction am i
capable yeah and then with the web
series that I did it was great practice
so then would you advise someone who was
you know interested in becoming an
actress to go down that a little bit of
studying route or do you think there's
another way that people can do this I
think there is that thing called The X
Factor okay there has to be something
like whether you're a painter and
musician yeah or you want to be a doctor
whatever lawyer whatever it may be there
you had there has to be something innate
okay that allows you to push further yes
the studying is important to preparation
is important but it can also sort of put
you in a box okay I feel like you can't
really go any further than than what
you've learned yeah so I think that you
also have to trust your instincts and
and just be really passionate about what
you're doing you have to love what
you're doing yeah
there were says everything in life
everything everything about what you
were to do you kind of just have that
passion and push for it because focus
for the fight the heart is for it
exactly yeah so let's start off with you
me and the apocalypse because that's
obviously where we met so how did you
get your role as Selene I was offered
the
the audition I was I was asked audition
right before Christmas 2014 and I didn't
know much about the show at all I was
just given the the script and a few
pages for a scene that she that she was
in and I had a fantastic character
description about six pages on silly and
on her life her background so when I
went to audition for it I felt like I
was very close to her and she ate her
yeah I didn't do much research about
nuns and and convents but I did go to a
private Catholic school for elementary
school and okay so I was surrounded by
nuns at some point and did observe a lot
and so that helped me also to to get
more into character oh and just explain
your role is actually a nun you can't
give away too much show so make sure you
guys keep your eyes peeled for it but yo
goom's get more into it anyway so do you
see any similarities between you and
your character probably the the fact
that we are very capable with languages
I speak several languages I speak
Italian English Spanish I am trying to
learn German because I'm currently
living in Berlin oh what a minute stuff
okay government is quite tough I had to
learn a couple of lines in Polish yeah
for the show as well okay that was great
and so yes his passion for languages
definitely may have a absolutely and do
you think that has helped you in your
career the fact that you speak so many
night it absolutely has I have to only
thank my parents for moving me to United
States if I stayed in Italy it would
have been a little bit harder to learn
yeah English without an accent okay
because as you get older the accent
stays and how's this different to maybe
any other productions you've been on
then this is a really on a grand scale
it's it's a huge production I've never
been a part of something this big I mean
really it gives you the sense that
you're working on a huge film set it's
really it's been a fantastic
rollercoaster ride for me even I
actually went on the set and I was like
they couldn't believe like how many
people were there how big it was and I
was like wow this is a big thing
absolutely yeah and that's been very
exciting for me
so what was your life like before this
production then quite simple I would
audition for a couple of things yeah and
wait for four results because you just
wait at home you know and you're just
wondering if you get the job and I
continue to do a few web series
low-budget projects just really anything
that was given me a chance to to just
learn and to get better better at this
craft yes which is the main thing for me
but if you knew that the end of the
world was coming what would be your last
meal it would have to be me Jonathan on
designer which very elaborate but this
is a Neapolitan dish and it's um it's
eggplant parm I don't know if there are
Italian American people that might know
about it I'm into bTW that's why I'm on
YouTube what would be a beauty product
you'd have on like at the end of the
world if you would need that you
probably wouldn't mean it but everyone
thinking about it yeah but I rely on
coconut oil for its it's a
multifunctional yeah product you use it
in your hair all over your body your
skin your face um you you it whitens
teeth yeah yeah it's just that we will
put the oil in yeah I tested it yeah
I've found some fantastic results from
that as well yeah and it's antibacterial
at some point as well so just it's
something that you you know you might
need if you weren't gonna be in an
underground bunker for like two years
what are the five things you would have
with you I'd have to have a good amount
of pasta with me typical but I can whip
up some pasta if you've got beans
lentils yeah there as well you make you
know if you have like minestrone yams
and all of these things you can you can
whip up a hearty meal so I love to eat
so I have to make sure I've got some you
know some good food in there like I said
the coconut oil I can use for everything
so yeah it's good to have as well what
else a stack of books I can't get
another
I need to have those moments you pray
for us I just finished reading girl on
the train okay
which a lot of people were talking about
and I do like further so I like to be
engaged and if a book captured me from
beginning Yahoo to the end it's just
it's the best for me so if there's one
thing on your bucket list that you
thought you would want to definitely do
before the end of the world what would
that be I feel like I haven't traveled
enough and I haven't seen anything my
parents yeah I mean they gave me an
opportunity to live in in different
countries and yeah right but there is so
much more of course yeah I would love to
travel more I I need to see the reality
of what world is yeah and world is like
out there even though this job allows me
to to do a lot of traveling as well yeah
I'm very fortunate in that sense yeah
but when you're working it's kind of
different to travel in for like yeah
exactly
yeah yeah work and you have to focus on
my work so being able to yeah off the
bucket list a couple of different
countries as well so have you had a
career high night so far you me and the
apocalypse has been a career highlight
for me I was really surprised and
extremely happy it's the kind of
opportunity that that an actor it needs
to to really get that kind of visibility
of course yeah on a more international
level so just maybe some key steps you
think that someone who's young who has a
dream but is a bit scared to maybe
pursue it what do you think you know
what's your encouragement to them and
what steps do you think they can take
cuz you said you were quite shy yes I
was I was very shy yeah I was very shy
when I was little I didn't want to put
myself out there too much I think you
need to just push keep pushing and keep
pushing and keep learning and keep an
open mind and I really don't think that
there's there's no way that you can't
make it if you really believe in there's
a hundred percent you have to believe in
yourself you have to believe that you
are with what it is that you see when
you see for yourself that's what you
were already even before you get there I
I felt like I was a little star walking
around in Naples like I always thought
that I had a camera so you know I would
do seems by myself of all these things
like I imagined it I envisioned it and
and I
believed that it could happen to me
eventually so I think it needs to start
from there did you have a plan B for
doing this so if this wasn't successful
do you have anything in place I don't
think there ever was a plan I'm doing
this no I I think that if I gave myself
a plan B then I was going to give up on
plan a and plan a plan a was so
important to me that I wasn't I wasn't
gonna allow anything else to distract me
of course in the beginning if you're not
making enough money I had other jobs
okay I taught English in Italy after
school did homework with children and
was nothing that sort of took me too far
away yeah for what my ultimate goal was
it's it's that thing that you you know
you of course you think about another
plan you think about it but you know
that if you want it to happen you you
just have to stay focused and that's
that's my number one thing is really
stay focused because a lot of people
didn't believe it just really felt like
it was it was just it's unattainable you
know you're getting an actress is seen
as something that you know it's it's
Hollywood and the red carpets and all of
that yeah it's it's all of that is
wonderful and if that comes my way you
know amazing but it's the work is the
work that comes with it in the
preparation and I just I'm looking
forward to just being able to interpret
my roles and and have more fun with this
because I would love to do it for as
long as I can exactly and this is
probably like one of those big roles
that predict you to even maybe there'll
be season two as well we'll see what the
audience thinks it's crazy

kaya but do you need comments below do
