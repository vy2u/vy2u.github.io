so today is an update video people I try
and do these once to twice a year and I
haven't done one for a long time I do
feel like it's about time I've got real
with all of you and I feel like
sometimes it's kind of hard to be real
on YouTube because people can be a
little bit critical now and I used to be
I so can't play and do all kinds of
candied things and you know things I'm
in a bit like Patricia why would you
come up on the internet and say
something like this but I used to be
very frank and very honest but now I
understand now you know there's people
watching you from all over who don't
necessarily understand your point of
view or your perspective but I feel like
it is important for me to just kind of
share a little bit about myself my life
and I know you guys have so many
questions so I'm going to kind of try
and answer them as much as I possibly
can so this one's going to be a little
bit of a rollercoaster so as I always
say get a cup of tea and get comfortable
so the first thing I want to address is
cosmetic surgery and if you don't know
I've not yet made a clear statement
other than on my Instagram that I did
have cosmetic surgery about a year and a
half ago and I had my boobies done I had
a breast augmentation and I did feel
like this caused a bit of a ruckus not a
ruckus but it was interesting to see
that lots of people had lots of
different opinions and a lot of people
were quite hurt by the fact that I had
had a boob job I couldn't understand why
someone else would be hurt by a decision
limit I made about myself but now I can
see why people were worth some people
upset and lots of people like you go go
and do what you want you know whatever
makes you feel good but then in other
people were like you know they thought
like it was hypocritical based on the
fact that I always talk about self-love
and you know confidence which I a
million percent still agreeing I don't
think you know having cosmetics
changes that in the slightest and over
two million women have had boob jobs
like much more and it's probably the
most popular cosmetic surgery in the
entire world
however no people felt like it was they
were disappointed but now that you know
I'm much more confident in it I was I'm
happy to kind of talk about the fact
that I did have a big job and I know if
you guys have noticed recently I made
mention to it I've worn lower top
because I covered up on YouTube a look I
was good like I know I don't want
anybody to make my first to my boobs and
I don't want an argument about it so I
just you know covered them up and but
now I'm now you know I'm gonna rock it
here they are here they are but I
completely see where some people and
maybe what confused but I genuinely
believe in self-confidence I do believe
in self-acceptance but I did lots of
research beforehand and there's so much
information on the internet about it but
again I'm not an advocate for it and
that's why I'm not gonna do a boob drop
video or anything like that but I always
say do all research and do make sure you
make the right decision for yourself and
I'm a grown woman out here okay secondly
it's my teeth and when you smile I know
loads of people make references my keep
saying that I'm going to talk about it
but I haven't so I keep saying it
Invisalign but I don't actually have
Invisalign Invisalign is a brand I just
had basically clear braces or the clear
retainer the plastic retainer you wear
different sizes of retainers it's slowly
move your teeth now I have a gap before
and I also had a wonky tooth the key
thing I actually wanted to fix was my
wonky tooth because actually quite liked
my gap however I'm moving this one key
to it has caused the gap to close up
slightly but the wonky teeth I just
called it had a mind of its own like I'm
smiling you just see the two just kind
of poking up the side smile you know
when everyone has that little niggling
thing that bothers them and that one one
key to bothered me so much and it's
ages but I've not been consistent and it
can be quite painful when you're
changing the brace and and it is quite
pricey so uh so yeah that's basically
what I have done
so my next really big announcement that
I'm sure lots of you guys have noticed
now is actually the fact that I am
pregnant yes I am going to be having a
baby
I am extremely extremely excited and
extremely happy about it but I also know
that I did not want to make a big thing
on the Internet or my social media about
having a baby and I think as soon as I
found out it's like and I get quite
emotional thinking about it I felt
instantly that I knew this was going to
be an extremely private and thing for me
and if you guys don't know me my family
and my family I'm getting very emotional
right now
my family my husband my home is the most
important thing to me in this entire
world and and sometimes people think
that I'm a little bit flaky and
sometimes a little bit vacant and stuff
because I'm not going to lie to you I'm
so content at home I'm so content with
my husband I'm so content with the
relationships that I have my friends and
my family they mean absolutely
everything to me and I do love but I
don't vlog everything i vlog because i
want to cuz i like to share and only
when I want to and as soon as I knew I
was pregnant something instantly said to
me that this was going to be a very
private situation for me because I
wanted this moment to be about my baby
about my husband about my home and I do
feel like having a camera all the time
takes away from moment for me personally
and I knew that during this pregnancy I
don't want to take away from any of
those honest feelings that I had and I
wanting to cherish them I hope that you
guys can understand now no time with
something you can never get back so for
me I'm just trying to taking this time
taking these moments so I hope you guys
can understand that I will share what I
can when I feel like it and I think lots
of people were making references I mean
I'll be honest with you people have been
referring to me as being pregnant since
I got married but as soon as the picture
of me that looks slightly bloated and I
know that people are really excited but
I think sometimes it can be quite it can
be quite quite rude actually I think
when you refer to someone as looking
pregnant even when they're not and you
never know what situation somebody is
going through and if you guys are
following me on my snapchat and all that
kind of good stuff you actually realized
that I was actually in hospital last
night and suffering from I basically had
read I had a fibroid I didn't realize I
had a fire boy which basically caused me
agonizing pain and I you know it was
very very scary at that point in time
and you literally never know what
someone might be going through so
sometimes I do feel like it's really
important for people to just be a little
bit of considerate of people's privacy
and I know that the world that we live
in and we are very excited and we're
already forthcoming but remember that
we're all well people out here and this
is a world while we're living in so all
I always think about that okay oh and
finally actually my hairline I have to
mention this here and there and is
finally coming out we are doing the
final pieces of work on the site our
final shoot has been done and I'm not
going to lie to you when you're trying
to come up with a business it's not easy
so much can happen it's not just okay
wham bam thank you man it's not like
that at all and this has been like I'll
be honest with you spend years in a what
and then put me about six months
complete and utter dedication to really
get everything going but I cannot wait
for you guys to see I really hope that
you're going to be able to
support me anyway I think that is
basically all the news that I have to
share with you guys
in the meantime things should go on as
normal I haven't really changed that
much like I don't really look that
different other than I have the glow as
people say and my belly is is getting
bigger and bigger but I'm just wearing
like really baggy stuff and yeah but I'm
very very happy with where I'm at right
now and I've just felt like I finally
just wanted to share it with you so yes
I am pregnant yes I did have a boob job
yes I do have Invisalign so now you all
know that's basically it people I know
guys thank you so much for watching and
I'll catch you later
