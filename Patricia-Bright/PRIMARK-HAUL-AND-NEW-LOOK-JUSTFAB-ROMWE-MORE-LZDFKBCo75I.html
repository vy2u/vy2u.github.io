video and to be honest I think it's in
the low since I lost the dinner oh I
didn't do all Linda's many whoopsie so I
think yeah I've been really good I think
my money's been more focused on like
stuff for the house and stuff so I don't
really bought much clothes for a while
but I've got a fair few bits so it's
just a collective haul of some stuff
that I've got over the past few weeks
and stuff so I'm going to show you my
bits from forever 21 and doing this I
don't get to 21 a lot because where
they're located is just a mission for me
so I bought some jewelry from them and I
found this piece here which I love it's
like got some really nice detail on it
it's kind of like a marble effect sure
you like that it's a gorgeous marble
effect and they bought this piece here
which is like a really nice Aztex it
looks like I was kind of keen and gold
again and I love them know about ten
pounds each maybe and the both of you
who don't know I don't often wear
earrings but I was going to wear a few
more bits and these are just these
little sets of triangle earrings at they
had and they're three pounds 99 and you
get like one two three four five
different sets and I love them because
they're quite small but and but they
look really nice everyone know then
finally I bought this jacket you might
have seen me wearing it and a few times
but I saw it once and I've gotten to
this position where I don't buy things
straight away and weight allowance if I
really want it and I actually really
really wanted it tried to find it online
and I couldn't find it went all the way
to Bond Street to go and get it and it's
just this really nice chiffon blazer
with this really nice blue kind of
detailed sleeves and I just love the way
that it looks it's really elegant and
it's a classic style and it's actually
really warm so from romwe calm and I get
some free stuff from them once in a
while and I
a large balance in my account I treated
myself took hope from them and it's this
amazing camel coat it's just amazing
it's like a boyfriend jacket but it's
kind of fitted at the same time very
Zara rich it's got these amazing pockets
here and I just love this kind of camel
cama cama cama kind of camel color in
light for this season basically I love
this really really nice no really weird
really random as I do and there's always
going to be one off but sunsetting knows
it's getting really dark really sorry
guys but um I bought this cow pillow how
amazing is this cow pillow he'll learn
calculus hello and can you guys guess
where I got this pillow from I wouldn't
say I don't know you can't guess can you
test code Tesco Tesco is like Walmart
maybe or something like that but it's
like oh how love is yours is it and I've
got a new sofa in my room now in this
like filming room it's kind of like my
own space I've got a sofa and I'm gonna
get a rug and then I got a caterpillar
and it was eight pounds from Tesco and
it was it's really nice it's gorgeous it
feels like ah so just sticking with from
their house bit I will sent some amazing
candles by Kringle candle and I'm gonna
do out zoom up on this actually so yeah
I was sent these candles by Kringle
candle and these are like scented
candles and these are absolutely amazing
and the flavors that they have are
amazing this is the mango one and I also
got the red cherry one as well so it's
like a big one and a medium one here but
they've also got these really small
12-hour ones so this one here is frosted
cake smells divine
and they've got American apple pie as
well and I've got sugar plum as well so
know that as I was just showing you that
guys those candles the Sun just decided
to disappear so I've had to put on light
here hopefully it's not too bad so these
are the candles which I got from Kringle
candle I got a whole bunch of them I've
got a draw for but they smell
solutely divine for those of you who are
really into candles and I just after
something different they smell
absolutely amazing and they've got
really really nice flavors flavors yeah
flavor the sense they're beautiful so I
love those so you guys might have seen
my what was he might get ready with me
date night video and I had this fitted
dress which is from new look and this is
really new it's like I'm obsessed of
this kind of midi skirt style now
so buddy comedy it's just so flattering
or in this color I also bought a
sleeveless one in like the Aztec color
and go to Thailand in like four weeks or
three weeks from now so I thought that
this would look really really nice of my
while I'm riding an elephant in Chiang
Mai but now I just love the design and I
really like this color on me and then I
also bought the black one which probably
looks a bit boring on camera but it is
really nice so I've had to put on a
light over there the color is literally
jet black and it's waiting now but some
of the items I got your monthly pick
with JustFab coat UK and this month I
decided to pick up some shoes just some
nice country flats I can wear to work
I'm on the way to work and not feel like
I look insane and these are kind of in a
silvery a silvery color with just an
extra colored toe area there and they're
really just some nice casual facts and
they've got a really nice thick bottom
so these have been quite good for
wearing when it's been snowing so I
really like these but I also went to
Primark and again Primark in some way I
don't get to very regularly but I've
been going to the one on top and Court
Road which is a lot quieter than the one
in Marble Arch been loving going in
there and working in there twice and
might bought a bunch of stuff and
returned it and then bought some of
their bits but the first thing says I
bought this jacket now it probably looks
like a granny jacket to you right now
but it's absolutely amazing on it's like
a tweed jacket and it's got these really
gorgeous and the Pels
I just love the way this looks with like
skinny jeans and something it looks like
really chic but like trendy at the same
time so that was that and that was
actually 26 pounds and I think that's
quite expensive for Primark but their
prices are going up but their stalls
have been getting a lot better so maybe
that's the reason why and then bought
this drapey hi-low top oh yes you can
see quite well it's kind of got like
specks on it so this is the pink Specht
one and it's like a high-low like that
bear it's got long sleeves but it's a
really nice breezy fabric and then this
is from their limited edition collection
it's an oversized jumper but I ended up
buying it in the size 14 and I'm
actually a size 8 or 8 to 10 but it's
like see-through so you can see my nails
there it's seafood and I just love the
way this look I was like even it was a
size 20 I would've bought it and it can
be worn it can be worn really well and
actually looks a lot more slouchy when
it's this size so I'm actually loving
this from Primark and finally you just
wanted to show a few more bits would
that been sent to me and these have been
sent to me by Regal Rose regal Rose is
like an online website where they sell
write really nice like really unique
jewelry pieces and the pieces are always
in point so this time round I got this
gorgeous necklace it's got these little
feathers on it here and I just looked so
pretty and then also I got these um
knuckle rings as well there's actually a
third one but I've lost it somewhere and
but they're really cute and that's like
a little feather as well and it'll cross
I'm really getting into feathers I think
I want a tattoo like I'm not even joking
I've been really thinking about this but
the what have you seen Paloma faith's
one but she's got some massive doves
going across here and they look gorgeous
I'm thinking of doing something similar
like that but who knows who knows I'm
not brave enough to be totally honest
with you but yeah guys those are my bits
from this haul and it's a really small
haul but hopefully for February it's my
birthday month birthday man</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
