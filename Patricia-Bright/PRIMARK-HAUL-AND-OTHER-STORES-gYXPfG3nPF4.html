video for you and I know I've had some
issues with my camera on my lighting
before please bear with me because I'm
like kind of just trying to get settled
into new house and positioning and all
that kind of jazz I'm trying to get
sorted out I think I'm almost there
anyway let me just carry on and do this
whole and it's gonna kind of be a
chitchat as well like along with this
stuff because I feel like I've bought
stuff based on how I've been feeling and
I know that sounds really weird but yeah
it does happen like there's a lot of
emotional connection associated with
shopping and I really feel like oh my
gosh sorry I wasn't gonna go on so if
you want to do get your cups of teas now
please do that but I feel like I feel
like I'm changing and I feel like I've
been really really stressed out you guys
probably can't tell because YouTube is
like my therapy and it makes you feel
really relaxed kind of set you from the
camera and talking but my life's so
hectic and if it's not one thing it's
another and rushing around and I feel
like I lost a lot of myself like because
of situations I lost a lot of who I was
and not personality but like me and was
wearing loads of kind of darks and um
just quite basic and I know I like basic
things but I was like why her I lost
some of my personality and my clothing
and like I felt like I wasn't as
adventurous I used to be and I'm always
world nude lipstick but now I'm like
getting back into brights and colors
obviously I'm always gonna love news but
I just felt like just starting again
afresh and I'm gonna be buying a whole
new wardrobe over time guys over time
and maybe clearing out the stuff that I
don't know really reflects Who I am now
as a person and this is far too
psychological I'm thinking there it's
way too much information but that's how
I feel and anyway it's only shopping
what you guys can understand how you can
associate shopping to how you feel or
what kind of mind space you're in I
thought my mind space hasn't been hasn't
been Patricia enough but and kind of get
in there
show you one of my monthly tips which is
from JustFab you guys know I always have
a monthly pic with JustFab and you guys
also know that I'm going on vacation so
I decided I wanted to pick up kind of a
you can seen getting back into colors
and burgandy's become one of my favorite
colors and it's this big chunky bag what
is from JustFab it's I bought it I got
it for February so it should be
available and it's the comment garden
and it's got like sand is this like
snake print here it's really nice chunky
bag this is gonna be like my pink beach
bag and I can't remember how much this
cost to be totally honest with you if
you guys want to see what's in my
holiday bag then let me know so I can
show you I'll be packing away with me
fair let me show you some of the bits
that I got from I think this one
yeah what's coming off clothing calm
it's this gorgeous hat I've been having
like some random bad hair days recently
and like hats have become a Savior I
love this hat Michael insults this hat
says I look like a cowboy all the time
but I love this hat and it's like from
it's a villar hat so I think that's like
a brand but it's a Norwegian I'm not
sure but this really large hat and we'll
put it on for you but you actually
follow me on Instagram Facebook Twitter
because you might see me pose for I'm
wearing things I've worn this hat a few
times in a few posts so I'll put on my
next below and you can check me out on
those social media platforms I think
I've been more focused on getting
holiday bit so I know it might be weird
for some of you like cold on this winter
go find umpire shouts so I've got these
little lacy white shorts and I don't
know if you can see we look at this way
to seal it you can potentially see how
lacy they are and not sure how much more
of the detail you can see but they
really really may see that crop top and
be like hey and I've also got a pair of
them these in black as well so you guys
can see but it's got like lace all
through it there and they're like really
short shorts but on the beach I would
wear like a bikini and they're short and
then I love jumpsuit I love jumpsuits
like one pieces I've got two or three
actually that I thought that if they
said yeah motel
Mattel do amazing and drops jumpsuits
and this is the one I got for this year
it's like polkadot black and white
it shorts on the bottom sorry and like a
v-neck it's so cute I also bought a pair
of green and skinny jeans and these are
criminal damage jeans so they do carry
that line on there and again just
injecting a bit more color I'll probably
work with like basic grays and whites
but I think it's fine to wear green
jeans and they're really skinny all the
way down to the ankle I think they're
slightly cropped as well finally I
bought another pair of shorts they're
kind of in a mustard I'm not so sure
about the color but I love the style
because it's like a high-waisted really
high-waisted shorts and they're baguette
in the bottom so I really like them but
the colors a bit mustardy but depends on
how I wear it I'll show you something
that fits that I've got from boots and
it's a bit of a drugstore haul the funny
thing is is that I've seen so many of
these and I'm sure that's the reason why
I ended up going into boots and like
buying loads of stuff but I'm glad that
gods have been posting videos on stuff
and boots and drugstores if you're in
the States just because I would I forget
to go into those stores now but when you
go in there there's a really good bit so
I just got some cotton wool pads and I
use these all the time usually I've not
tried these ones but I think it says
it's got two different surface texture
so that would be really good for a face
or nails it says and I bought some of
Eros skin relief I heard a lot about
this moisturizer but for me I usually
use things are a bit greasy because my
skin is dry okay and a lot of those like
maybe Johnson's baby you know show some
of these lotion I like water on my skin
and it like absorbs in about four
seconds and then it is dry again but
this isn't like this this is actually
really moisturizing so for the black
folk out there who get quite a she this
actually isn't like watering your skin
so I really like that you also got Suzy
always talks about this mudra and
dissolving and you literally put your
nail in it let me show you guys you put
your nail in here and literally you just
squash it in and it should just dissolve
your nail polish off amazing and then I
got some cleaning clear advantage spot
just Rock treatment gel
it's one of those things that if you get
a quick spot you just put it on there
and it kind of stops it from getting
bigger and worse and redder and just
horrible and it kind of release it and
helps it go down I've heard a lot about
this and I was like yeah let me let me
and pick this up so you guys have seen
this probably many a time I got the
Maybelline um I still do lost in jaw
drama tell eyeliner I've had this before
and it dried out but I personally feel
it's because I just didn't look after it
really really well so I'm gonna try
again with this I hear really good
things and a Neutrogena are visibly
clear porn and shine daily scrub I'm
sure you guys have heard about this and
it's about tithing my pores I have
massive paws on my nose they have got a
lot better to be totally honest with you
I think I'm one of those person people
who because I know that I've always had
that problem
I'm always quite keen to ensure that it
doesn't come back again but it's been
doing very well but hopefully this is
give me some smooth skin the iPhone I
thought was this Revlon Colorstay and it
says 500 addictive and for you guys you
know I'm just queen of neutrals I don't
really like colors on my eyes at all so
I found this palette it's a quad and
it's got its really cool I might show
you it's got like instructions on the
back on how to use it and where to use
it so if you want the kind of forward
steps dimensions then you can use that I
might do it in a video if you guys want
to see that leave a comment below and
they also bought the Maybelline volume
express mascara I don't usually use this
I'm usually a L'Oreal muscari user but I
think this is on offer like if you buy
four things or three things from
Maybelline you get something free so I
picked up this and star and then the
lipstick I'm wearing and I'm trying to
kind of just get back to normal so I was
like I need bright lipstick so I picked
up this lipstick which I've worn a quite
a fair few times and it is a fun fun
time fusion that sounds like futuristic
fun time future
I bought two lip glosses from Maybelline
and it's the 40 24-hour super stay I
think it's got a
I'm not Antoni so it's got like a
conditioning bond with it and I picked
it in the creme caramel and rose duh so
these are quite neutral these are
neutrals again but I've got one kind of
one right and then finally I bought two
gorgeously pink lipsticks and these are
both from Revlon and it's in lollipop
and sweet tart so it should be nice oh
just to add I was looking for like some
shower gels and stuff and I do like nice
but not all the time I don't know this
stuff it's quite expensive you don't
want to use all the time but I like Ray
Docs if you like colors in really really
nice smells they've always got some
great products and this is a shower
smoothie and this one is the
passionfruit and papaya which is
delicious
literally delicious and it's got little
bits in it and it's got a sign on it
that says do not drink me because it
actually smells that good like you could
you can taste it in there and I'm kind
of just trying to refresh all my power
to power totes
all my electronic tools and stuff so
I've bought some new straighteners my
own straightness I've had for about four
years and you could tell that they're
just not working as well and
technology's got so much better recently
that I probably don't need to use old
one so I bought a new one and these are
my Remington ceramic straighteners they
were 25 pounds we've also bought this
amazing blow dryer I don't know what you
guys have but basically the blow dryer I
had before this was crap I'd rarely blow
dry my hair but when I do I would like
to have something nice and this is
amazing like it's got cool shot and it's
like not winging it you have to hold it
for the cool shot
it's like permanently cool air if you
want it to it's so powerful this is
lovely and when you plug it in it's got
this nice pink light that's not it I
don't know if that's important but these
are from total hair experts brand so I
also got some items from war to your
skin calm and they did send me these and
it's basically a skincare range which
focuses on like watering the skin
basically their products are sulfate
free paraben freeze synthetic colors
free silicone
three and preservative-free so it's
focused on being just really clear and
really pure a really pure product that
is healthy for your skin and I got
basically four different products ones
the day cream the cleanser and the body
moisturizer and the serum I've not been
I've not used everything I have used the
same I really enjoyed using the serum at
night because I do feel like my skin
looks a lot more puffed up in the
morning but a bit more plump which I
really like the thought of my skin
looking plump and young and healthy and
gorgeous and actually I have tried the
day cream as well as UVA UVB and Patek
so a sunscreen action and it works
really well
I've enjoyed that so do check out their
website I've left the link below and I
would say so far I really liked the
serum and the day cream because those
the ones that he used to finally guys I
mean part of me building my new wardrobe
I'm a to Topshop and I bought like this
is my new shopping mattre basically buy
things that are a bit unique or unless
and buying basics a bit unique tell a
story and I'm not just trendy and you
like for a particular reason so that's
it so the first thing I bought was this
top which is a tassel top you can
probably see there it's just gorgeous
and just gorgeous and Tesla and it's a
basic vest but then it's got the tassels
on the bottom and I bought this because
it was one it's quite high low so the
bottom tassels at the back are really
really long and I think it's great for
layering so I also bought this leather
skirt as well I do have one or madiba I
thought this was a bit different because
it's got the leather band at the top and
the leather band at the bottom it looked
good it was like a little crop top like
this as well I also bought this
miniskirt which was like 22 pounds
really cheap I love the design on it
it's quite basic but it's got the
patterns on it as well and I love
miniskirts full for winter and for some
like a just wrap with tights and
winter I bought this this t-shirt I
think it's like a muscle t-shirts just
because of the way it fits so it's
really quite baggy and manly but then if
you wear it with like some really tight
skinnies or miniskirt then you can
really make it look a lot more feminine
and I love the distress color because
when I put it in the wash loads it would
look fine I also went to bershka and
bought this white top here which you can
pop this ease like holy-holy this kind
of knitted sweater and it's kind of a
v-neck and off the shoulder and it's
just really really cute with long arms
as well yeah and I think sure I don't
show you as well this top here which is
from new look it's kind of cropped I
don't need to see my stomach because
it's just not very toned right now but
it's really nicely that's really good
just as this necklace so guys I hope you
enjoyed that whole and it wasn't too
long for you and your copy dingo card in
the process and I will see you guys
later do let me know what you want to
see next because it's hard to think of

lookbook but just of clothes like no
theme and nothing just things I like
