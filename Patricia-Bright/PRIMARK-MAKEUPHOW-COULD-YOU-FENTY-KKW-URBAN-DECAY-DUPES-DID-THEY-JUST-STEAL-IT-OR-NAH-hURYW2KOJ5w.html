brick you didn't do it this is rude
k'kaw are you shaking hello there
beautiful bright people welcome back to
my channel I hope you are doing well
today
we're about to test out cheeky little
Primark makeup and I you know I went to
Primark for the first time in like 4000
years I haven't been for ages
pleasantly surprised and if you don't
know I found out that they had makeup
this was news to me my mind was blown I
was shaking in my boots and when I went
to Primark and I saw the makeup I
realized that there were a lot of
products that were basically Jeeps it
was actually quite scary how thing just
right no her boy what kind of always
blatantly doesn't ripped off like just
were knowing Brad's right I was confused
by the way your girl is wearing earrings
can you believe it it's a new day in
Patricia price world remember for ages I
just stopped wearing earrings but now I
really like them again and I love these
like dangling in my ears that's what I
was doing for another day but yeah went
into Primark and saw that they had a ton
of basically what I considered to be
dupes of you know one I'm Beauty like
k'kaw you know Kim is she gonna be
shaking there's even some 20 copies a
lot of urban decay copies and I just
like guys come on
so I decided I'm gonna compare the prime
up makeup to the actual originals that I
think that they had juked and see if
it's any good so if you're not already
subscribed to my channel make sure you
subscribe and then I am gonna be doing
giveaways this month of May so you have
to follow me on my Instagram and on my
Twitter be really interactive and I will
DM you going about winning the goods
okay okay let's do this so I feel like
everything's like matching with primer
right now I'm not wanted by Primark
obviously but there were so many goodies
that look at this with primers
foundation like honestly they had a well
stop beauty section now the first thing
I picked up was this three-pound primer
it is
oil-free mattifying skin primer three
pound people three pound and to me this
was giving me Smashbox primer just from
the bottle and I just feel like it's
gonna have that same like silicone II
like texture and effect so I don't
currently have that one but I know what
that one feels like on I'm just gonna
see if it's like that I mean it's doing
what primers should do and it's actually
quite nice it feels really nice on
anything is I feel like it's like
boiling up a little bit is it or is that
something on the back on my hand I mean
yeah nice so I have this primer from
wire so it's a blurring primers kind of
got gold flecks in it it's a little bit
bougie but it's this kind of same
silicon II base of a primal primer but
yeah in comparison it's a lot more thick
and luxurious this definitely is a bit
more smoother and creamy but obviously
you're paying more for in price but this
is still a nice primer this still worked
but yeah I just forgot how banging that
primer is oh wow so next up Primark also
has foundation errors that pound for the
foundation and three pound for this
foundation so this is a matte foundation
medium to full and this is another
foundation which is the long-wear
ultimate and I have that this has been
compared a lot to the Estee Lauder
Double Wear foundation this was the only
shape for my skintone but let this is
not even because you know diversity of
whatever they only had four four shades
in general like light medium beige and
dark that was it like it was just very
very limited this is cool expresso and
this is rich expresso these are my
options I can tell they're already too
dark
but I'm just gonna try and see what I
can make work actually having a tan look
at the bottles I can see how people act
like it's kind of a dupe you can see
that they tried they tried a primer you
tried it with the bottle and everything
so to go ahead and apply that I'm gonna
use this little brush this is tell me
this is not read people this is rude
KKW are you shaking probably not like
come on bro come on from the colors to
the packaging and nude
so this shade is too dark normally where
I shade a bit more like that they're
like literally two different shapes
let's see well let's just see what this
foundation looks like I don't feel like
we can do a fair comparison if the shade
isn't even right it's not even close to
being right but it's a nice finishing
foundation and it's definitely mad
tonight I might do I'm gonna try the
other foundation we're going in with
this one my perfect color this shade is
called cooled espresso and it's a more
of a medium to full coverage although it
seems quite full coverage now that color
works we can that color can Han this
isn't bad
I like this I like the finish of this
it's got a nice finish it's actually
very natural looks really like care for
my skin and then here's the foundation
it looks super natural now I'm gonna go
in with the Estee Lauder I haven't
actually used Double Wear in a while but
I do really like it I feel like it's a
good foundation it's a stable one I feel
like I've got more coverage here than I
have on the other side I like how I look
with this foundation more I'm just gonna
be honest with you I like I look more
than I look like this as I said it was
really natural looks like I haven't
gotten foundation on I'm just like why
do I look just dry I look bland whereas
here I got way more copper so next up
this is a little cheeky Primark so they
have their eyeshadow their eyeshadow
palettes the fact that they call this
urban I think if root do these not give
you indicate there's another one that
niching looks just like the make cities
palette and they look exactly the same
they kind of have that smoky effect
going on with it
I like Mac these are four pounds but
look at this we cut just urban decay
really you guys are taking the monkey I
don't I don't I don't believe you didn't
do it so I'm gonna use this palette this
urban palette from urban decay and it
very much is giving me the vibe of the
new are and Beach eyeshadow palette
listen I don't know how they did quick
turnaround like that they did it so I
feel like it's giving me the vibe of
this collection what was similar to me
with the colors inside the palette so
maybe they decide
oh we're not gonna just completely like
copy everything but the colors will copy
I haven't actually opened this artisan
Oh
the imagery looked really promising but
the inside is disappointment it's
actually disappointment they're all
maths there's no ship I mean there's
some kind of yen I mean okay so it's
nothing like that
indicate about it from far from far bit
look like it was similar up close
nothing like it I'm gonna firstly go in
with this orange here for my transition
Jame what it picked up relatively nicely
okay oh okay
unexpected it's actually very pretty and
it came out nicely from the urban decay
I'm gonna use this shade here called
daybreak this one's got a lot more
pigment like a lot more pigment
instantly instantly was I had to build
that up but it's mad that I was able to
almost build up slightly a similar shade
this is a lot more pinky and definitely
more pigmented we're gonna go for this
pinky shade right here in my outer
corner be honest I'm surprised at how
much the pigment actually comes out on
this it's actually really quite nice in
all honesty it comes out we see it it is
very pink though you know what it shows
up it's quite nice they don't blend them
really nicely and I'm gonna say here
that it's like blended for the gods it's
not that blended but it will do I'm
gonna use this revolution Pro palette
because it's got more pinky shades in it
I would say if you were looking for
something really affordable I would go
for a revolution Pro now this doesn't
have any form of like a gold for like a
halo what we have is like a shimmer
yellow which actually is actually quite
nice you know you can't judge books by
the cover and all of that oh okay okay I
didn't expect to see that much color
come out
I mean the only thing that's slightly in
comparison here is blaze whereas this is
a very yellow we kind of almost given me
trim firm trophy wife vibes that I
wouldn't really wear on my eyes
whereas this is a little bit more
wearable now but I'm not mad at this I'm
not mad at this at all under my eyes I'm
gonna use the blue because obviously
blue is the color everyone's loving blue
right now put that under here the blue
is quite powdery you know but it shows
up it's just powdery mad dry this
palette we have these two blues there's
the shade labeled double-dip and plunge
gorgeous look at that look at that honey
okay honey okay honey before I put my
lashes I did buy the false lash effect
mascara nobody feel like this is a
particular dip but there are fair few
mascaras called false lash effect and my
favorite ones that is called the foal a
ship it is from way and smell like and
it's gold as well so I don't if they
were trying to like you know kind of do
a thing oh I like the brush that's a big
old brush it's a nice brush it's lifting
it's separating it's cute such a cute
mascara on my eyelashes my favorite
mascara is the benefit bad girl bang
mascara
it gives me actual lashes it's crazy
brick can you see the way that blue is
popping in comparison to that dull blue
come on guys come on is done okay I'm
gonna go ahead with my mascara
I actually think these lashes do look
better than these this is kind of an old
mascara you know but this mascara one
unlike the bottom lashes but actually on
the top lashes the primer mascara was
alright okay lashes are on I'm gonna say
I love this like pop of this yellow
color I didn't think I would but I like
it now listen Primark you rude this is
just this is just rude but we're gonna
use it anyway here you can see that my
monkeys
accompanying auntie Kim and yeah from
the stick to the contour stick to even
the advert I get it you got to do what
you got to do you want it to copy and
I'm not a mad you know don't hate the
player hate the game
okay we have the kind of yellowy orange
stick and then we have this kind of
thing okay a highlighter stick and a
cream contour this isn't even bad this
is actually dark I never expected this I
didn't expect this Primark okay okay
let's see is this gonna be looking kind
of let me try blending it with a sponge
let me see if this branch the sponge
belly absorbs water listen this is
literally like rubbing my face at the
brick why is it so hard that just
blended Wow interred into 0 into the
dust into the ether terminus I wasn't
confident in that concealer so I picked
up this concealer as well
my perfect color again this is give me
the NARS creamy radiant concealer vibes
there is definitely some similarity
between the two of these for sure
oh okay I feel like the color looks nice
but this is my perfect kind of like
yellowy
nice under-eye I'm just gonna use a
concealer blending brush to get that in
a concealer is nice it's really light
coverage though it's light coverage but
it is nice here's our NARS creamy Radian
okay so from a concealer perspective
they can't compare as you can see this
is really bright in my face this is
really disappeared into nothing
unfortunately I mean the color wise it
was nice but here besides that kind of
looks like I don't even have any makeup
on it's mad how they can be actual
product and it just dissipate like it
just evaporated into thin air like what
happened how annoyed would you be you
spent you spent your whole day like
beating your face that didn't do your
music on and then you look at your face
a night with it up a minute cup girl
okay let's go ahead and use this contour
stick though it's dark I'm not sure it's
gonna be dark enough for me
oh that's actually growing
that's actually great on me wow so what
we won't be using this one we're just
gonna we'll just come up with it
you leave on that one just gonna lose
this work break to contour it's not back
on top it's just kind of invisible and
look for my k'kaw contour stick i don't
you think i finished it so who needs my
sin t which is actually very similar as
well look up and i as though you know
let's compare i mean it tried it try it
on the nose a little bit alright let's
just get this on a tree care
so the Primark contour versus the Fenty
contour I forgot how good the Fenty
contour stick is like honestly so they
had their own global panic glow glow oh
it's actually quite pretty neat and tidy
and I like the packaging at - I could
compare it to maybe my Sahara blush
palette maybe in terms of the color
picked maybe this as a highlight the
orange oh oh I never smelled it I never
aspirated Primark
that is gorgeous how much is this Alec
five pounds it's like that it's worth it
for that one that was good and actually
I'm gonna swap out I'm going to use my
revolution probe highlighter palette
because I feel like this is kind of
slightly comparative to this okay not as
comparative because this one's nuts
I forgot it's crazy what's crazy is that
actually feel I feel like the primer on
warm
I like the makeup revolution one but I
like the primer or more and let's go
ahead and use is this gonna be
highlighting we should use that as a
little oh god it's like a highlighting
blush yeah no I wouldn't use that much
ink it's just - that's - but I will go
ahead and use B on this cheek it's kind
of similar in tone but without that kind
of reflectiveness I'm just gonna set
with my powder a touch so now they also
had a range of lip kits kind of for
Kylie maybe but I do feel like more and
more brands nowadays hand the lip kit I
feel like the whole new thing having a
little box is definitely a trendy thing
and yeah I wouldn't call it an exact
dupe but I get that you try to copy that
idea I just got these on makeup
addiction cosmetics
this is their new nude collection they
would you Kate bran homegrown amazing
and these are matching you
I don't know that out yet or they're
coming out I've got them in PR from the
lovely they need these are absolutely
glow just darling
on gorgeous so if you want to pick those
up I have a link down below she's super
sweet and I'm just loving loving this
nude so I feel like I can put compare
one of these to at least something in
here I'm gonna be honest with you for a
woman of color I don't get pearl liners
like what does it do it drive really
really really really really really
cooked quickly but the color is nice is
it nice
is it nice I can tell I'm going to use
my chestnut line up this glittery
driving about four seconds flat this you
know it's got time to move it's actually
quite crumbly actually quite crumbly
okay so there is my finished face and
this is my Primark sight there is not
much color but not much pigment when it
came to it the foundation that I use and
also the concealer I thought they both
dissipated into water but this glow
palette actually was kind of popping I
might just keep this in my collection
and then the lip he was really dry it
was really really dry but it isn't awful
but it is dry like if you are somebody
suffers from dryness this is your gonna
be crackle back in scaling away with
this lip product but from the eyeshadow
palette as well I felt like it looked
rough but some of the shades
surprisingly look really nice I feel
like obviously you can see in this that
just looks more done but you know this
side cost a lot more as well so you know
I'm not mad prymaat you drive overall
like if you want to check it out try it
out just don't go crazy and I do think
it's important if you want like nice
makeup and good makeup invest save your
quite buy some goodies but in a rush or
if you need some stuff stop
yeah go ahead the guys that is me Donna
