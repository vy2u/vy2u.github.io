they are scamming this did not give me a
she undyed hello beautiful people
welcome to my channel I hope you are
doing well and today I wanted to kind of
do it or not in regards to products that
I've seen a lot on Instagram and that
has been hi and I wanted to share with
you the things that I think are
absolutely you work the high and also
the things I don't think are all of that
you know I like to keep it fairly honest
with you guys not fairly very honest
with you guys
and they're definitely things I see that
really why why's everyone talking about
this I think it's really not that D and
also there's some things that you know
me I'm an info commercial Queen I love
it
but there's some stuff that you know I
think it's out there it looks good and
it works amazing and I just want you
guys to see exactly what I'm feeling I
hope you guys enjoyed this video if
you're not subscribe subscribe follow me
on all my social I have it down below
but I'm not gonna do lead Ally let's
just get into this video so the first
thing that I've got to tell you I
actually think is wow I think it's
absolutely amazing it's gotta be the map
Patrick Starr and collection it's a
collaboration between Mac who we all
know and love and Patrick Starr who's
obviously an influencer and a youtuber
out here and I've got to say the
collection is really really good the
products really really amazing they
aren't necessarily all like new.i
shadows but what he's done is kind of
collated some of the most amazing ones
that are out there I feel like it was
perfectly curated like the color
combinations in both of these palettes
are literally the a match made in heaven
there are exact combinations of one
existing Mac products that would always
buy but just it's nice to have it handy
in a quad just like this absolutely
phenomenal please look at that packaging
though it's so Patrick it's just shining
like really nice really glorious and I
just think it's fantastic the shades are
right up my street this is one that's
slightly lighter so I wouldn't wear all
of these but I couldn't
a lot but I created this look today with
basically a combination of the two of
these and honestly just you know what
that's not like matte shadows are really
good they're really good and I think
it's just reminded me on how good they
are I've also tried the shade Patrick
crew which is a really nice bold red I
think I was wearing it in one of my
videos or a picture that I had up and
everyone was at what lipstick it was and
it was a Patrick Fulop stick which I
somehow could not find you know when you
lose a product that's amazing like I
used it and I've had it in my bag and I
kept it with me because I really liked
it and currently I can't find it but the
memories of it was it was phenomenal and
definitely was a nod to rooby-roo which
was one of the first Mac Reds that every
on war and then I think the hero product
is obviously the setting powder which I
know a lot of people were a little bit
scared of if you are of darker skin tone
because it isn't like really yellow or
really pigmented and it looks like it's
more on the pink side but honestly it
blends in flawlessly and I'm gonna be
real I think it could be better than the
norm or like yellow and then I look that
some of us can sometimes have including
myself this did not give me a she under
eyes I was set and I'm feeling it and I
love it and it's it wow I love it okay
so next up this is a product that you
guys might have seen I gave to my sister
in December and I know I also have one
and I just gotta say guys it is the
Dyson it is the Dyson supersonic I know
I know it's glorious it's gorgeous and I
know none of you guys know Dyson as the
technology company but they also have
this amazing hair dryer it's very very
fast it drives my hair very very quickly
and it's super quiet as I've been using
it I've really enjoyed it and I
definitely feel like it's worth the hype
given the fact that it is so
good-looking I feel like I did an
Instagram like I'll buy my Christmas
tree to get out of the box just to show
how cute it looks and its really good
looking but it also works very well
which is very important bearing in mind
that I do my hair
at night and my baby's room is next to
my like getting ready room but I just
blow dry my hair and she doesn't wake up
because it's nice and quiet I love the
fact that it comes in this handy case as
well it also has two different nozzles
plug it in blow dry your hair if you
would like to you can add the nozzles as
well for a more streamlined look okay
guys we're going to get into this this
right here I was actually like oh my
gosh why did I know about this I feel
like it's changed my life and it is this
called the style Pro limited nuts wanted
or anything I came across this product
at beautycon London somehow it was in a
goodie bag or something you might be
able to buy these on eBay they also have
their own website I think basically it
is a black brush cleaner and I like to
keep my brushes clean I'm not gonna sit
here and pretend like I do it all the
time because they don't write some of
them are looking a little bit worse for
wear no joke but this I just brought it
out and like a couple of weeks ago I
thought you know let me just try to use
it this stuff works and I was like why
did I not about know about this but it's
been out for at least a year if not two
years honestly no honestly it's rude I
have to show you I talk too much I gotta
show you it comes with these different
attachments that you can put your
brushes in this is my brush this is my
foundation brush that I use today I'm
just gonna find the attachment that
holds it nice and tight and then there
is this thing here which kind of spins
and twirls put that in there right
there's also like and make up brush
cleaner and go hold on hold on
I just realized the guy on this is the
guy who was on Dragon's Den if you guys
watched dragons then you'll remember him
no it was your dragons dental was he on
the apprentice he was on the apprentice
actually that is the guy oh okay he's
out here doing kind of inventory okay
fine so basically you put the cleanup
and I feel like this is something that
basically breaks down oil you can either
use soap and warm water if it's like for
a powder brush or you can use the clean
art if it's for something like
foundation here's my bowl here's my
brush turn it on
bring it out for like 10 seconds
look my brush is virtually crystal creek
clear it is also my gosh oh my gosh it's
also bone dry dry dry I think everyone
is on I don't know the exact amount but
it's a great I think it's dry and it's
like fluffy and it's like new again you
can make me whole again
okay so next up is a little bit of
skincare and I don't know if this is a
high product but for me I'm just like oh
my gosh this is amazing these products
are from a PLC so dermatology cosmetic
laboratories DRC except and it's an
expensive brand but the product is good
and you guys know I love my acids I love
my chemicals I like I like my science
I'm not I'm not I put my hands up I'm
not one of these coconut oil you know
cook it on the oven add one Algarve a
and a lemon and it's doing too much what
I want is bottle goodness bottle
goodness which I feel like this is this
is and I've recently been suffering from
really bad skin really dry skin I have
eczema around my eyes and you know the
winter are so harsh right but this is a
cleanser that when I'm putting it on my
face it's like it's so nice when it goes
on my face I'm like why does this feel
so good feels so good when it goes in my
face it's more like a really gentle
cleanser it contains glycerin in it it's
very gentle but really I feel like just
is really cleansing my pores from within
and I'm also using their hyaluronic
product from this brand as well and it's
just so amazing
and I feel like as soon as I started
using it just the moisture and the pump
plumpness started to come back and also
I have skin that sensitive so sometimes
I can feel it like tingling especially
when it's like really cold
or I've done something or I've applied
something that my skin's I Nabi don't do
that girls don't do that I found that
when I was using this or as I've been
using this it's really helped to come
down but oh my gosh like I really like
DLC and I feel like it's hot
more in like though like people who are
really into skin care and deep skin care
products but this amazing okay and
finally my Webster heart is as you can
see it's my fancy lippy I have been
wearing these and absolutely loving it
but in the same breath I'm almost gonna
say slightly not worth the height
because what I've found is that you know
of the colors that are out there they
say say there's like there's 15 or
there's 14 different shades
realistically there are only two of the
shades that I'm gonna wear and Griselda
and PMS which I'm wearing now really
really nice they do definitely transfer
not gonna lie they definitely transfer
but they look a really nice on they feel
really comfortable now a matte finish so
yes like this PMS is worth the hype
Griselda is worth the height but the
fact that there's 14 other shades that
are just not matte well it walks but
still these bad boys the ones that do
look good they look absolutely
phenomenal in my opinion it pops it but
gonna pop in now we're gonna go on to
some stuff that really to me aren't
really worth the hype and yeah certain
stuff it's just it's a trend you see
trains so the first thing has got to be
easy did the dirt I remember I did a
video about buying shoes on eBay and and
I also bought a pair and and I didn't
tell you guys which buyer I bought them
from because I wanted to be sure that
they were authentic and then I went to a
reseller who were like no they're not
authentic and I paid 450 pounds of them
and I realize out here there are people
who are scamming they are scamming
because they look authentic they had
authentic packaging distribution
everything was authentic if I just
wanted to double-check what your find is
at this the way that the little bubbles
are placed that they're embedded or
they're not embedded there's certain
things in it like it's
to do with this bottom part there's some
random things as to how they check so
then I found that I spent four hundred
fifty pounds on fake Easy's I was like
excuse me I have to have an ebay dispute
and everything percent my shoes back and
then they try to like not give me my
money back it worked through some whole
process so no don't buy the Yeezys on
ebay just go to official retailers
anyway so I did get myself another pair
of actually easy the easiest and these
are from I think the newest season
normally they sell I think it's like 180
pounds but by the time you start buying
them I ended up spending I think it's
four hundred and seventy pounds and no I
know I know people and I got them and
then nice they're nice
yeah they're nice right but everything
means that it's just it's just the
trainer you know it's literally just the
trainer they look nice
I like how they are and everything I do
feel like that bigger price and the
height that people go through just makes
it not even worth all that high and then
they're cold so when I wear them in the
winter I'm like why do I feel like a
breeze is going through my feet that's
so cold right they're not they've not
got lots of like layering it's kind of
woven I say I paid 400 pounds of these
for my toes to be cold not worth the
height I said it this I feel like I'm
gonna say and I feel like you can
actually get quite a lot of hey if
you're genuinely honest but I think I
have to be honest and I I feel like what
it's not what the other well like I'm
literally stumbling over my words the
thought of wanting to say this right and
it's kind of to say that not that it's
not worth the height but there's a lot
of height right and it's obviously
around 20 beauty
and I think that no brand should be
above being able to say that product
isn't all that and I feel like Fantine
is almost on that verge of people not
being able to say that something is in
all that and so like it's the line is
great right obviously it's great it's
inclusive wonderful grits good stuff
right what's that
but what's really important is also to
put up that is really useful and stuff
like that so for me like the foundation
was okay it was okay for me I I don't
really wear it on a regular basis so
that's one really thing I realize like
it hasn't been my go-to foundation I
know for some people it really really
has been and then like for instance I
think I bought like the blotting powders
like these these are stuff I ended up
basically picking up everything in in
height like that type of it were like I
don't know I won it off
I like honestly I found that the
translucent powder wasn't all that and
also like they say these rotten powders
and you know I'm saying height as if
anybody hyped them
nobody had them I didn't actually hear
anybody high up in knees no brand is
above criticism and I think what they do
is amazing some products are actually
amazing and some I'm not all that this
is a great example of like you don't
really need this kind of pipe you know
this I've seen these literally
everywhere not gonna lie it doesn't it
really cool it's really really cool
but I'm gonna say it's a big old tin for
miniature product when I see certain
things to run brands on that and love
that idea and everything but well this
one I was just that I didn't understand
the colors and maybe cuz these for me
were never gonna look good on me what we
have is this shade here which kind of
resembles a corpse so we should just
call it corpse gray not quite sure how
that was gonna look on me personally I
have seen it look good on some people I
think Jamie Genevieve did a video and I
thought wow you look amazing I look like
I came out of a grave
zombie and then this
was the the NIP shade which actually I
could just about rock I could just about
rock with and then what we have is the
strobe on the top and for me I just find
a lot of shades like this and colors
like this they they look great on video
and they look great in images and
instagrams but when you if you saw
someone walking down the street with it
she'll be like are they well are you
actually well do you need the doctor and
then this goes on top and for me it's
just like at one has to get to a place
where we're not doing stuff just because
it's height I want us to do stuff and
look at me talking but I'm trying to
tell every brand out there like let's do
stuff because it's we're gonna have
women enhance their bue and make them
feel more attractive but triple anis it
is nice to experiment and to explore
even for photographs but it's nice to
like go to the train station and not
have everybody staring at you and you go
no I'm a train girl you know I get on my
public transport I should do a video
doing my makeup on the train because I'm
a public transport girl I've run for the
Train if you ever see me say hey should
I put the lippy on for you let's just do
it
let's do it there's a she in the
nosedived and rose again zombie hmm
so dad that is what that has me looking
like I mean I get it I could do an
institute if you like but in reality I
just look what are you doing babes that
was that okay guys that is it for me
I'll give you my wow the stuff that I
really really like they're definitely
worth the hype and also the stuff so I'm
like no babes
no it's like just just leave it leave it
behind it needs to go no it's just my
opinion I know some things are amazing
on some people and some things are just
a hot mess on others and it's all
relative right but for me this is just
me sharing my personal opinion and feel
free to share yours down below if
there's any other things that you want
me to try out and give you my opinion on
then let me know in the comment and then
