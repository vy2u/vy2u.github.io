couple of New Year's Eve looks for you
and I thought I'd show you what I might
be wearing for New Year's Eve I hope
it's not too late and it still gives
some of you guys some inspiration but I
wanted to say that I'm gonna be doing a
Q&amp;amp;A in the new year I'm gonna just do an
ox pack anything you guys will not
answer me just ask me send me these on
Twitter on Facebook
I'm definitely leading on my facebook
messages when you guys send them over so
they can be from funny to advice to
random to whatever you want to do ARC's
pack because I really want to make sure
that I can you know engage more I've
been getting such positive feedback
recently because I feel like I've been
being a lot more just transparent and
trying to be a bit more you know
personal with you guys and I really want
to do that more often because if I don't
know if you guys love it
so guys anyway if I don't see you guys
let me think before the New Year's make
sure you follow me on Twitter
I'll be gone there and I will see you
guys later have an amazing New Year's
and keep safe so I'll see you guys later
bye
so let's start off with outfit one which
it's a sequin top and some high-waisted
riding pants so if you're like me you
like to keep it fairly casual you can go
for a sequined crop top like I'm wearing
here this is from Topshop and I think it
just makes a really casual look look a
little bit more glamorous and a bit more
New Year's Eve ish
I love their way riding pants are really
really flattering on most figures and
basically they come up so high that even
if you're wearing a crop top you can
only see a little bit of flesh and you
guys know I love leather so I just
thrown a leather coat and that's me done
and because it's quite plain I pair it
with some really cool booties and this
really cool furry clutch
so I love this local because I'm a girly
girl
aha but I love this little shift dress I
bought it in new look and you can see
it's got a little bit of detailing on it
I love the fit and I love the fact that
it's got a little bit of kind of black
lining around the neck and around the
sleeves and I just pair it over long
chain now it is a little bit short but
that's kind of what she's dresses like
so I've paired it with really chunky
shoes and a chunky bag wrap your
leggings around my hip and seeing as
it's a little bit cold I just throw on
my chilly which I think makes it look
really cool so finally it's the bodycon
dress and I call this my dress this is
just dressed I've had for a long time
and I always feel really good about
myself when I'm wearing it
I just pair it with my Chanel bag and
some black shoes and I'll probably wear
like a flurry jacket or some leathers
protection so guys those were a couple
of my year's eve looks oh you have a
great time stay safe and make sure you
add me any of your questions on Twitter
I'll see you guys later bye come to me
look at what you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
