is going to be a hair tutorial and as
you can see I'm no longer wearing the
Miss Nadine hair I no longer have the
ombre ends what do you think do you
prefer me with darker hair I think I
prefer me with dark hair really but yeah
anyway I'm gonna show you a tutorial on
how to get kind of Victoria Secret big
bouncy waves and I'm I'm using a
remington jumbo curl hot rollers
magnetic roller thingy bobby which I
bought from class Olsen class Olsen is
that store that's kind of like I care
but not by it's kind of Swedish
Norwegian all at the same time and yeah
the these are already heating up but
this is what they come like you get 12
rollers you get eight big ones or four
eight small ones and four big ones and
I've done it before and I found that if
you don't ensure that these are heated
up well like at least 10-15 minutes then
your coals are gonna drop and actually
did it like a few days ago and my cars
have really really drop and I didn't use
any hairspray so maybe that could have
been the reason why and I paid thirty
pounds from this and spot for this and
it's got a three year warranty so I'm
gonna let this heat up and I'm going to
show you how I put these in and how they
work okay so my rollers are hot enough I
think I've left them for like 20 minutes
and for those of you who don't know I
wear a weave with a shoehorn bit I don't
have much move out very little and my
hair is actually like probably as long
as the extensions at the front but I
don't like putting heat on it regularly
just because it causes it to get damaged
so I move it out of the way and I'm just
gonna take one section I do my like
front car first
and these things actually get really hot
so you just want to hold them at the
side and you just want to wrap it around
from the very end round and then you get
the clip to attach to it put that on
like that and avoid it resting on your
skin because it will get really the best
effect I think you want the four smaller
ones at the very front two big ones at
the very top and then just BAM the back
middle two big ones and then the other
four little ones just round the back of
the head okay well after that is me done
with my hot rollers some of them are
kind of falling out but really it's not
neat or don't even know what it looks
like that's the back and what I'm gonna
do is I'm gonna leave it for like half
an hour I'll do some other stuff and
I'll get back to you and you should be
ready to take down okay so it's been
about an hour basically because I
thought I might as well just leave it
longer I don't know it's going to come
out my butt let's see you can unroll it
or try to keep it as together as you can
and at this point you can add some
hairspray
my children they are really really cold
get some nice colors
okay these does seem like they're bit
warm so I don't know if I should just
leave them yeah it's gotten a little
cold so I will just finger pal through
them now and put some hairspray but I
don't put any hairspray in my hair
extensions
so that's my results really it seems
like it gives you more of a full-body
look maybe if I had to use smaller parts
or smaller rollers it could have been a
bit different the drafter body look I
think these are good and also think if
your hair is quite thick this may be the
result but um what do you think do you
think it's okay I like it I like it but
this is probably the cause that you get
in 20 minutes
thanks for watching guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
