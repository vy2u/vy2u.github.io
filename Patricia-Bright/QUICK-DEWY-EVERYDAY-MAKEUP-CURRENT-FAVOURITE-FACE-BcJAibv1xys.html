favourite face I feel like I'm gonna do
these once in a while when I kind of
change up my look I do feel like this
look is quite different for me and it's
not the most trendy look but it's a look
I feel really pretty in sadly I was
talking through this video but I
realized that the mic was off so that
hasn't been captured so I'll probably
just do a voice over and it looks
different I think the one thing you'll
notice is that I meant a bit like
pinkies and I've got gloss on and I
haven't got a wig lined up which looks
so much different to normal but I really
really like it I'm the kind of person
that I always say it's not about the
products you use it's more like about
you know how you use them I list
everything in the description bar the
love hey guys I hope you enjoy and I
will catch you later okay
so let's get you to my favorite face
honestly this could be done in five
minutes and it's really natural and I
think it's quite nice for every day so
my foundation is the new foundation from
YSL I know you said this has got more
coverage is a little bit more thicker
and it's nice and Juby you can see what
the two sides look like but I really do
love this one and I used it in my last
tutorial as well nowadays I do take my
foundation down to my neck as it's a
little bit darker so for my brows I'm
still using the anastasia dipbrow pomade
I'm gonna be honest with you it's not
really my favorite I usually put the gel
over it as well but I think I'm gonna
move to pencil so I also use a concealer
this is the bare minerals bare skin
concealer which I am really really
liking I use that around my brows to
make them nice and tidy and I use my
finger basically to kind of blend it all
in as well so moving on I am just going
to highlight my face I kind of do it
quite gently and I am using the artiste
brushes which I really like some people
don't like them but I've never really
good I don't think they're overrated
although they are quite pricy
my blending my concealer and I also use
my fingers to blend in my concealers as
well
for my contour i use the Anastasia
contour kit which I do really like and I
love this angle brush from Estee Lauder
as well but my eyes are basically using
two quads this is one from Tarte
which has got really nice purples and
brows and I'm just creating a little
bridge and then I'm using my warm
minerals palettes from Mac which get so
much use I feel like this is the only
palette girl really needs if I be honest
it's got really nice pinks and browns in
it and I go ahead and use the darker
purple from the Tarte quad and I
basically just mix and blend between the
two I basically been picking lots of
pinks and golds in my inner crease on
the outside I'm using a darker purple
but because I can look like I've been
punched in the eye I go ahead and use
some concealer as well so I'm lining the
inside of my eyes but I am avoiding
winged liner this mascara here is
literally a favor I love the kind of
comb on it and it does make my little
lashes look good but I also put the
lower lashes on which you guys know our
favor I have a discount code in the
description box and then for my setting
powder I am using the Sasha Buttercup
people asked me if I prefer this to the
Ben Nye and the answer is yes I prefer
the color and I find it is a lot lighter
and less drying and I just brush that
all in gorgeous I've been loving
highlighting with this Milani
highlighter which I bought on Amazon
super cheap and it gives you such a glow
I use it on the bridge of my nose my top
lip and it makes me look nice and dewy
and this lipstick here is my literal
fave I've worn it every day since I got
it it's the new way I sell these are
just beautiful and I just line them with
Bobbi Brown and I'm using night Moff as
well just for a little bit more color as
well but I just feel like this is like
my new favorite phrase forever so that
is me done simple quick takes five
minutes and I think it's really like
everyday appropriate so guys I hope you
enjoyed and I'll catch you later
