have a quick breach time get rid of you
and i want to show you what i do to get
a little glamour
while i was away in l.a shoutout to my
sponsors diet coke as part of the diet
coke break series and bring you this
video so number one whenever i go away
the sunscreen is a hundred percent
necessary and even though i am dark
skinned it is important for me to keep
my skin nice and protected and even and
I take my sunscreen very seriously and I
also go ahead and use a primer because
that really does help with oil control
and shine
you guys are thing we do this million
time yes you girls eyebrows need to be
filled in because I haven't had them
micro bleh did and I go ahead and
actually do the powder before foundation
trick because it she works really well
especially at the beach and in warm
weather I follow up with some foundation
to add for my beach time glam just too
even at my skin tone and you know I like
wearing makeup you know most of the time
I go ahead and add a concealer and I
just go too heavy with concealer because
the worst thing is when they crease when
you're wearing sunglasses so I kind of
go a little lighter than I normally
would and of course blending is
necessary for my eyes I'm lazy I go with
just a wash of add already brown and a
gold or silver and of course mascara and
lashes that to me is like a classic
Beach time look I go ahead and line my
lips Brown is the way I go neutral and I
do wear sunscreen on my lips what's
really important to do that and then I
go ahead and add lip gloss or a lip
product on top but be careful with lip
glosses could you come at some burn in
the Sun and then I just powder all of
that in to keep it nice and set
so for my favorite hairstyle it's got to
be you know loose ridiculous wave just
because like my hair can kind of frizz
out my extensions can freeze up so I
like to add cause there was no point in
trying to go pin straight when it is hot
and Ginyard I don't do that I rock with
a curl and a wave to create something
really loose and glam and beachy I use
my fingers to uncurl these and yeah it
just gives me a really nice natural look
now for me a beach dress is essential
and I love this a red one it's got a
little split at the knee and is really
calm and relaxing and cool I ended up
with a middle part instead as I
mentioned I've been doing a diet coke
break series over on Facebook and I
picked up some of the demand ideas and
have decided to apply them today and one
of my favorite things has got to be the
tattoos I can you go wrong with a silver
foil tattoo no you can't I feel like it
looks absolutely fabulous so easy to do
and kind of makes me feel like a little
bit of juvenile but it's quite fun just
to add that little bit of glam to your
bare skin after that another thing I
picked up is to use glam jewelry and I
don't do this all the time but when you
do do it it just adds a little bit of
extra sass to your hair and I feel like
this is perfect for LA just extra boho
glam so guys that is it that is my glam
get rid of me to the beach and I hope
you guys enjoyed and make sure you check
out the diet coke Facebook page as well
you can catch more of my videos in the
meantime I'll see you very soon bye
hello guys welcome to this week's diet
coke break ever so I am Patricia bright
