create an updo hairstyle with like short
hair so my hands got a bit of texture in
at the moment cuz I've curled it
recently and I have created a side swoop
on the front which is what I want for
this hairdo so what I do is I just
separate the front bangs type area cuz
I'm wearing hair extensions and I don't
want my hair to show and this is going
to be like what I call the coverage area
and so what you do is you kind of with a
fingering moment movement you just kind
of lift it up I'll go ahead pinning and
you try to get as high as you can
just left it to the top word
and you use the hairband to do that so
it doesn't matter if it's all messy and
stuff there because that's more or less
the look you're going for then you've
probably left with that little little
fan at the top there which is not a
problem because we're going to fix it
over here me do this I don't like how
long that part is so what I'm going to
do is just take that and wrap it round
rocket run the back and pin it
but I'm going to also do that with these
side bits here as well that are too long
and they take it round
on the back
so then with this one what I'm going to
do is not talking in we're sure hey you
always end up with these little flyaway
bits which is quite annoying let's talk
it into the hairband
I'm probably gonna pin those down
so with this part here this part is
going to stay out and this part I'm
going to grab like this
climb it forward and we've got about
that and just wrap it behind my ear bits
that are all like big and stuff can
easily pin those down
so guys it's as easy as that to create a
messy updo hairstyle which is maybe
something quite to you quite casual you
could probably dress it up with some
kind of hair ornaments to look nice on
them right now I hope you liked that
video guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
