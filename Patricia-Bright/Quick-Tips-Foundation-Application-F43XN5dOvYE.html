on creating this look I have no real
kind of name for this look it's quite a
natural look but it's got quite a lot
there's a lot going on on my face and
this is kind of inspiration from you
guys because some have been so mean to
me because you know my makeup is a bit
hmm a bit hit or miss I won't lie I'm
not that good with makeup it's not my
forte at all but I do want to get better
at it because I want to do my makeup
myself for my wedding day so I'd better
get good at it I'm going to look like
some ugly bride so yeah I'm trying to
get better and if those of you who are
new as well you can kind of see what I
do I've had a lot of inspiration from
other youtubers lip shop being my
absolute favorite this lady is the most
amazing woman when it comes to makeup
blending everything editing everything
perfection with a cherry on top you must
check out lip shock okay I'll put a link
below she's amazing and yeah I've had a
lot of inspiration from her so anyway I
hope you enjoyed this video and this
look bye guys okay guys so this is at my
face without any makeup on I've kind of
already filled in my eyebrows and
concealed them so we're not going to
worry about that I use NC 50 Mac Studio
Fix when they call it under my eye areas
and I apply it with my fingers because I
just find that it's easier
and I also highlight what kind of used
the lighter concealer along my nose
under my chin and at the top so I'm then
going to use my sleek revive around my
halo area
and just dot it
and then I use my Jean satin liquid
which is a little darker than that on my
darker areas
I'm gonna use my stiffening brush I know
that crazy and I'm just going to blend
it all in
okay so now that gives me a really nice
like even toned looking my face but very
monotone so then I'm gonna go ahead and
use my Mac moonrise my mirror minnow
lies on my face just kind of
maybe a bit more flawless and I'm gonna
begin contouring and highlighting and
before YouTube I would have never done
anything like that but nowadays I can
really see the value of it and I'm using
this sleek contour kit for I think it's
for the dark accomplished
I'm gonna highlight undertand around my
eyes around my head they're not going to
use sleek Santorini which is quite a
bright pink on the apples of my cheek
so I would consider that to be my for
foundation and my flat face done so if
you want to keep watching you can seem
to get my eyes my lips nothing special
so my eyes I'm going to use something a
bit more natural this is max expresso
I'm going to use a darker Brown in Y
not my inner corners I'm just gonna use
like a gold get another format
I'm gonna line the outside corners of my
eyes with a black pencil
and I'm going to do a really thick line
of liquid eyeliner
I'm just going to use a L'Oreal mascara
and then I'm going to use this
Maybelline lipstick it's in the velvet
beige but it's kind of like a pinky
okay so I added some lashes and this is
the final look of this tutorial which I
have no name for and I hope you enjoyed
it that's watching guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
