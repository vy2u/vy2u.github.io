doing today I wanted to do something a
little bit fun and if we're not been
meaning to do this for a while but I
haven't done it and it's about to go
down today we are gonna watch my old
videos I'm talking about the videos that
have been left behind in the dirt that
they ate for anybody to see we're gonna
go back to the videos that I first did
yeah so if you don't know I've been
doing YouTube for five years five years
you know I can't believe it and I'm just
gonna find my oldest videos I'm gonna
look at them and look at my embarrassing
self and again there's lots of videos
here that you guys probably will never
ever see and they've done a video like
this before but I get a cup of tea it
should be fun I haven't got tea I've got
avocado apple and banana smoothie thanks
to my husband actual virtual teas I'm
tearing out my outfit like what am I
wearing and I'm sitting there why is
that a headband around my scarlet
where's the waist but so high
what is church roaming today I'm going
to ask you the same thing for Tricia
what are you wearing well let's go to my
first makeup tutorial
I've lost eyelids but guys it's been
right and you've got the intro wrong
Patricia hi guys it's been worse inside
laughs it's a video today I'm doing
video inspired by uh miss it's miss
technical she didn't look which is like
a glassy eyed look and I thought it was
fabulous
so on-trend see I love oh I'm getting
Vaseline for my beloved Vaseline oh it's
going for the real Vaseline it's the
fake breasts means I got my best thing
this is fun
this is emoji I know about this so I
picked on my eyes oh my gosh Patricia
what are you doing why you pouting what
camera is that no point in going out
feeding lights up my hose so I got
changed oh my gosh
actually remember this dress it's the
nervous dress
this dress was was from first up the one
thing I notice is that I never had a
voice like my voice always sound really
grainy and it was really like it was
always this drone speaking because I
used to honestly I used to party so so
so much it was really bad how much I
used to party and I might wear those
turns I always be shouting and like my I
would lose my voice like four days at a
time
and just listening to how I'm straining
when I speak is so bad hands that
working hard because it's what you've
got
and everything so I've been kind of lost
in that and come forgotten with YouTube
channel I feel really guilty about that
I licked myself I travel all this but I
spent about 4 500 pounds online I spent
500 pounds on landing and I actually
confess that I've really been a big
spender from the very beginning today
it's honest this and what am I wearing I
just like you should never leave the
house my coming I literally look like a
32 second non-video from an awful outfit
I remember this why am I wearing that
all the cool headband on my head looks
so steep so this is going down here okay
and my boyfriend rose up with me yeah
yeah exactly that's good right
oh my god with me believe it this is my
actual breakup revelation I didn't talk
about Lucy oh my laptop broke my laptop
broke as well I think it is a kind of
person I smell through my awkwardness
because there must have been quite upset
its point in time but I just love the
way I look good good in Cairo

my cow prints I'm sorry that you guys
had to deal with this individual at some
point in time I actually always been a
mad woman I said oh I'll Patricia you

been on this channel one time but she

bit dodge but that one there your bare
face that's pretty much the same no my
skin does not look like this anymore my
