trash hello beautiful people welcome to
my channel today I want to smile and be
like how you doing and all that jazz but
today today is not that day today is not
that day I have been in Shanghai and I
came back from Canada this morning but
I'm sitting here doing this video
because it's like you know what it's got
to be done I've got to say my own part
on this you know sick little situation
and by the way thank you guys so much
for 2 million followers can you believe
it how how we do it how did we do it can
you imagine that we've done it we've got
to 2 million followers it it's
unbelievable it's unbelievable yes I
look crazy because I do feel slightly
crazy and but I I appreciate all your
support and I love you guys I'm gonna do
so much stuff and I can't wait to do
more but today we're about to have a
little bit of a moan we're going to have
a little bit of a moan because you know
tart shaped ape foundation you really
you really you really did that in 2018
you you really did it so I'm going to
give you guys my full first impressions
of I'm gonna call this the crumbs from
the table that is what I received I feel
like you know and I can't even look at
you guys because I'm just like like what
the hell what has happened is that
topped and have release 50 shades of
beige you know it's 50 shades on actual
beige and actually it's not 50 shades
its 15 shades and there are three shades
for the darker skinned women I don't
know what my Indian friends or Sri
Lankan friends are gonna do cuz I don't
know where you sit on the scale you can
just wear hopefully several of the
shades mixed together I don't really
know what they were thinking you know
outrages is put important because it
brings change but I just think to myself
it's really 2018 and you did this you
really did this and you know that you
know we know it's a big issue I
personally think it was really strategic
I think it was done on purpose I think
you are trying to play games you know
how do you have 20 concealers that are
the number one selling concealer in the
yes and you came out with gray and an
orange at 15 foundations I just feel
like you would come on Wow
it said well it said like 'hey-- and
they said Wow I'm bored and I'm
unimpressed then my mom says this thing
like she always says I see or meet and
she gives me that face you know is that
this look of disgust and then their hand
moves see your meets your myth that if
they do well you you're doing nothing
and I feel like just doing that to talk
I'm gonna press that I'm moving but that
I'm just like see your mitts you people
they're launching they're doing
foundations of all colors of all shape
and you have the audacity to come out
with 15 shades and then backtrack and
discuss that you're coming up with 10
more later mm-hmm mm-hmm
we heard we heard and for those that for
me so if you're not you know I'm not
waiting for you at the door you can go
over there I'm gonna complain but
there's so many people out there doing
greatness that you know we're not
actually that bothered you know fancy
foundation hello there's 14 shades the
number one selling foundation in the UK
is the Estee Lauder Double Wear fifty
shades and it made good Lancome ten
adult forty shades if not forty four
shades Bobby Brown love Bobby Brown just
worked with them 30 shades nos 33 shades
L'Oreal Paris 33 shades even huda beauty
as problematic as that foundation is and
made me break out 30 shades so your mix
look at them who W is a new brand
Fenty's a new brand and they came out
with foundations that everybody could
wear all almost where and you came up
with 50 shades of ash and expected women
to just put up with it
I just don't know so yeah that is just
my thoughts on that and I don't think
given the year that way insists like
it's 2018 you didn't think about this or
you planned this and I think that you're
getting a lot of coverage and a lot of
use and a lot of attention and I feel
like the release of the additional
shades think it's actually more of a
marketing show
strategy but I will be trying them if I
can get my hands on them because I'm
probably maybe you might be off the PR
list but you know I'm sorry secondly I
think I just felt like something web
from us where I had to say this like
I've seen certain people who have been
problematic towards black women and they
say it was in the past
but realistically a year and a half ago
you were calling certain individuals not
certain names that I do not call women
using the c-word on women calling other
women raps attacking women and you know
you've been off-key jeffree star to
women of color and now you're here like
you know defend up you know I don't
really want to defend this to billing is
just that that's just that's just
something that hurts me and then just
use it you know you know it's just that
it's a great PR strategy for a lot of
people but the reality is that this
issue diversity is not just a PR
strategy is some people's everyday lives
in the makeup industry in the work
environment in you know medical
treatment so I know this might be a
great way for you to grow your followers
and be like I care but actually you know
this is some people's everyday lives but
we're going to get into this review I
think I've said enough here we have the
PR box that was sent over and funnily
enough I haven't actually used the top
shape tape concealer so funny enough the
concealer came in here which I haven't
tried and then here are the shades that
I receive now do you know what I'm going
to be honest with you seeing this this
doesn't look that bad you know if I
received from a brand almost
quote-unquote 600 only this is looking
like actual you know desert wastelands
so I'm gonna look like a ghost with that
on but um you know foundations that kind
of look from afar like they could work
for me it would look okay but I think
when you realize and in comparison to
every other shade that's out there it's
basically the crumbs from the table and
I don't eat crumbs darling I eat gourmet
gourmet darling there are two different
foundations that one is more of a
hydrating foundation and one is more of
them
that foundation it's much more similar
to the consistency of the shape tape
concealer so it comes with this brush
and funny enough some of my favorite
brushes are the top brushes they're
actually quite good and they always stay
in my collection they may be leaving my
collection you know after after you know
today but you know we'll see okay this
is very rich and that is real Road okay
you said wow it's so wow this is really
a WoW there is really no gradient they
should have just left that the door they
shouldn't have bothered so yeah this is
the three darkest shades they sent this
to everyone as you know you know y'all
black people you're gonna be one of
these four ishe know just know
yeah so I'm just trying to work out what
my option is maybe this you know a
luminous red middle shade could be the
one that works for me okay so I'm gonna
go in with the rich sand rich sand which
orange this is actually face paint why
does it look so orogeny my god this
looks like this.what foundation used to
look like in 1999 then we have one of
those antes in her facelets right
why does your face look red auntie okay
let's just brush this in
so on camera that looks so red so damn
red unbelievably red in real life it
doesn't look as Road it isn't bad I love
that finish that like matte finish and I
think the brush is quite nice I quite
like the brush I'm not gonna lie the
finish on that is so lik like the finish
is really nice and the shade isn't that
bad on me but the redness is what the
big problem is but it doesn't look that
great
it looks really red on camera but it
doesn't look really red here
I'm shockingly surprised this shape
actually looks okay on me but like all
the other shades and nuances in-between
have not been accounted for especially
between these two colors like the
difference between here and here is
night and day honestly some of us are
brown so I'm not gonna count amel so I'm
gonna sub warm some listen there's
undertones I feel like for the girls who
actually have their shade it would be a
nice a nice product if I'd be completely
honest with you but I'm not gonna
recommend you guys to to buy it because
I want them to learn like you don't do
that so it's nice but don't buy it until
they have more shades but it is really
giving me an airbrusher friend okay let
me try the concealer pale much better
like look at that that's a much better
gradient look at that now look at that
that is a shape tape concealer there's
gradient right I'm going to go ahead
with this concealer here as well
so if I be honest with you on me it kind
of looks flawless um that's unfortunate
because I'm not gonna keep using it but
the finish is really nice I didn't
expect the finish to be as nice as that
and the color has blended in nicely on
me so why couldn't you get the shades
right and and this is a whole this is
the whole thing even though it works for
me and it looks great on me what about
everyone else that's left out you know I
think that's what the principle is like
you know I look good but what about
everyone else it's not fair it's not
right you know now I'm gonna move on to
the hydrating side and for the hydrating
side I have been sent three different
shades and we can see you know desert
over here which is it gonna suit me
there's the mahogany which matches the
matte one and there's also deep honey
what they didn't send me is rich sand
which is this shade so I'm just gonna
have to try and make it work the shade
that is called tan sand as you can see
it's not for me and then the shade after
that is called deep honey deep honey
looks like that again which is just very
light for me and then mahogany and with
a hydrating foundation is also a sponge
that comes with it this is just a
blender I've wet it already it's cute I
mean I feel so unnecessary so let's just
see what this looks like this shade is
again not quite right it's less orange
and red than the other ones but as you
can see it's a bit too light yeah it's
definitely not as full coverage more of
a hydrating light coverage
I mean you can still see my spots I
because go see all my pores even though
it was light because it's quite a thin
coverage it's kind of blended into my
skintone
obviously this side is a lot richer and
a bit darker than my skin tone this one
is just it's just there it's just there
similar to like how I use that glossier
tint there isn't much there but it
depends on the kind of person
some people want this kind of
evaporating into thin air makeup look it
isn't necessarily for me the color
actually isn't that off for me either
but there's a stark difference between
the two sides
start difference this is not my kind of
finish like not like this is my kind of
finish this is not my kind of finish and
also it just isn't doing much it's just
giving me I feel like I need loads more
basically my beard is coming through and
everything and we're going slightly
Ghostface costs get ready
Ghostface Killah you know down here so
we're I'm dark are and I've built that
art it looks kind of grey beardy mmm
yeah this foundation is darker than me
but I love the way it looks
this this to me is honestly this is
basically trash put on my little do lip
glow okay so that is it as you can see
this side is way more of like a
hydrating more glowy look the color
we're kind of on ash territory it's very
neutral and because it's quite thin my
natural skin color can come through so
if I just blend it blend it away blend
it into nothing it's not it's not harsh
it doesn't look too orange
it just looks smack-bang neutral over
here this is much more of a red and the
finish is flawless like that foundation
finish is beautiful okay so like the
actual airbrush but you know look at my
face and look at my neck so this is
darker and it's just I'm already already
here so yeah from my shake
perspective it's not great but the shade
up there's literally no gradient so I've
got no choice it's my only choice and
then on this one yeah I actually think
that this may be a bet a bear color kind
of but it's not even a finish time I
even personally like if I was gonna pick
any other foundations it would
definitely be the matte one because I
think it looks gorgeous as a finish
we're talking about the shades they
haven't got the shades right
matter of fact you just felt like you
just got it wrong top I know you're
coming out with ten additional shades
we're way in the pressure is so on the
pressure is on you know I'm not gonna
judge until we see it coming out and I
think the important lesson is that and
the more we or speak up the better it is
and I know makeup can sometimes seem a
bit trivial but it's almost like a
reflection on society and I think they
say whenever there's a recession there's
a there's only one industry that never
goes down and it's the beauty industry
during recessions because people always
want to look good because when they look
good they feel good so it's almost like
an emotional reflection on how people
feel about themselves is the beauty
industry and if you don't see yourself
being represented and if you don't see
yourself being considered important or
as an afterthought it can affect you
know self-esteem for groups of people
but to Venice you know I know too many
black girls will pop in our self-esteem
is not impacted by any of this darlings
who we just won't be buying your product
okay I've listed my favorite brands down
below and I'll keep them listed there
who are inclusive and do have amazing
shades that I would genuinely bad for
and recommend in the meantime you know
talk do better and yeah guys I will see
you guys very very soon there's anything
else you want to see let me know in the
comments but in the meantime I will
catch you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
