gets the guys excited
hi guys welcome to my channel I think I
kind of very young right here right now
whenever I wear my hair up I feel like I
look young we're going to get into the
hair but even I'm looking like that but
really this is up go back to school or
something I don't know we'll see we'll
see but today I have a favorite video
for you and I do not do favorite videos
every month I do not do them regularly
but the reason I really wanted to do
this video because there's some genuine
things in here but I really really like
I thought I could put a train I've got
to trade people I wanna share some
things with you that I feel like are
really nice and I'm making a big
difference to me when it comes to at the
Beauty side of things and I feel like if
I share this is you maybe some of you
guys will relate you'll see it and
you'll like it so let's get straight
into the video the first thing I'm going
to share with you is this okay this is
the LOC pain this is the intensive hand
balm for very dry skin now if you
doesn't watching me for long enough I
get a lot of people commenting on my
hand I do not foresee hands they're kind
of wrinkly they're kind of old looking
and they always look like that and I'm
the one with the hardest hands in my
family like even my dad's hands up the
other day I with hands and I'm but
definitely pull your hand and they were
soft my mum's hand saw my sister's house
was so slender and pretty it just mean
who has these really coarse dry wrinkly
hands however all right this has been a
hand life Savior and I have a video
coming up in about being more feminine
and womanly and having hands that are
just soft to the touch is a really
essential
this right here is so good it's very
intensive very thick and you know
sometimes just to keep repeating and
keep putting your hand cream on this one
here you just need to apply it one time
a day and you are good I really really
like it is intense in hand them enriches
organic shea butter and it's a very dry
skin the good thing about it is that
it's also not greasy sometimes you'd
cream your hands and
and this already to the touch it is not
only to the touch and I really like me
so the next two product I absolutely
love it's not a brand I've ever talked
about before or even that I've heard
about before but this listen
so the branded could a Borean and I
believe it in the South Korean brand and
I specifically am sharing with you the
night cream that I use every single
knife probably since about October and
also this is a Boreum it's the lip
product look at the lip product this is
how much lip product I have left and I
don't quite know what I'm going to do
when it's gone because this lip product
is nice so I had an allergic reaction
actually to I think of an Anastasia
Beverly Hills
it was a lipstick and it's not just that
one there's a couple of hours anytime I
use a certain kind of liquid lipstick
and get like a lot of breakout but kind
of like a breakout on my lips and then
it starts to kind of bubble up a minute
friends are going to go a bit puffy and
liquidy and then it goes really drank
last week it's kind of lasted for like
two months and then I was using this and
this was a life Savior and now whenever
I feel like I got like a slight tingling
on my mix or anything I always use this
lip balm I think it is amazing and then
this is an eye cream again something I
use very regularly
it's a really nice thick moisturizing
night cream without being oily and
greasy what woody and dry skin like my
skin needs to be hydrated but sometimes
it can react with this my skin just
absolutely loves cake
let's talk a little bit about hair so
you guys have been loving this been
loving it I'm surprised because I I
never really wear my hair in natural
form again this is a ponytail okay it's
not even a pony time they'll be honest
of you people this is a frontal that I
wrapped around my own pony tail yes
Patricia reveals it all if you guys
watch my Instagram stories I did a live
stream on way Instagram cereza but what
how's that I do and I put the frontal on
the phone is out and then just wrap it
on the end of that was this it is an a
white frontal which I have linked in the
description bar below from my own brand
of hair extension some days looks like a
lot a cars always wearing you part I
can't always very wink I want to switch
it up and I said this yeah I'm going to
switch up my hair all the time
some people don't like it some people
like it I love it cause how did you get
the edges on fleek two things one I've
been using the Tara can't leaving
conditioner
another I'm kind of using it as a
commercializing mother
I love character if you see my blog to
see that Tara has been a classic in the
collection it's great they sell it on
look fantastic even a more amazing I can
get it next day delivery I don't even
need to go to the ends to go and get my
product
Hey and then this is another one which I
can't get online is 2 pounds 49
different mix on freeze gel and my
hairdresser used to use all my hair all
the time this has your edges just like
clock just tight just cool it
I like to put a headscarf and press it
all the way down and I end up even with
a slight wave my even my curly tightly
curled 4b 4c hair but it can have a
minor wavy now I'm loving it yeah next
up let's talk about a bit of L'Oreal
product that my favorite number one it
is the infallible foundation you guys
have seen my ad some of you guys who
follow me I am a lawyer ambassador so I
get to use product early I get to
receive samples I get to know about
stuff and sometimes I'm even in an ad
and the infallible foundation is
actually amazing it is so good it's a
great everyday foundation full coverage
matte finish great for people that means
you are oily I actually think I have a
tutorial coming up I've in my next video
the video after but I generally need
really liked it and in the UK I think
there are only maybe seven shades of
this I wish they were slightly more
shades you know it happens
however L'Oreal
so far for me all those favorites when
it comes to the drug store catering to a
diverse range true Matt is just there's
nothing quite like very much range and
this is just a really good product I
think in America they have more shades
the color I'm using is 33 cappuccino and
then after that it is this lip pain nah
I love this lip pain this color is
called Galvin ooh-gah when the news I
love it it's a struggle amazing it's so
gorgeous
ah it's just one of the perfect needed
for like a brown guy like me I just
think it's amazing
hold on but then when you combine it
with oh my gosh this here this is a get
your many and colors for some reason is
I've been very attractive and flattering
about nude lips on a woman and I know
that when I do this lip combo I get all
kinds of looks from all kinds of men and
like you know I'm married and all
thought but I feel like this is the lip
combo that really gets the guys excited
so usually I wear that lawyer knit front
up and then I put picot on top of it
these are the three be highly glosses
I've got one of them on my nips right
now on their own fabulous love it but
they would that oh my gosh so the color
I really like is color too and color 19
was it color too is a color 20 is color
20 on the gods of them in your eyes this
is a bit more of a pinky a nude and this
is more of a new de this is a newly new
that I like to combine with this oh I'm
so excited right now
another loriel product is the false lash
superstar x5r if mascara has actually
been in scar that I've been wearing so
much that I've actually not been wearing
eyelashes as much as I normally do so
those of you who don't know actually
wear eyelashes on a very regular basis
like a seriously regular basis and I'm
trying to like give up but somedays my
eye like I just look bored and I'm like
no we need to do something about it
however this really does give me body
and volume and fabulous lashes I love it
so the final beauty product is the mask
this is the soft matte complete
concealer the color I'm using is a man
day oh my gosh I love it it gives me
such a nice blurred
smooth full coverage finish and actually
it's this a bit warmer than some of the
other concealers that I have been using
I love it there's so many shades as well
and it's a full coverage but Matt and I
thought if everyone's doing my full
coverage Matt right now circuits a trend
but I really really like the finish on
it it's very very good and I don't have
a lot of nos products in my collection
but actually and Esther he's actually a
makeup artist he does my makeup for my
wedding special occasions she's
phenomenal she always uses nose on my
face oh geez electricity's knowledge you
should use nods and says I've got that
and I really really love it
finally I don't know if it just this
magazine but it just might be teens in
general a really wide prostate of not
reading or looking at any magazines at
all because obviously we got the
Internet
but some of the times is actually just
nice to slick for a magazine as being
inspired I don't know what it is there's
something nice about just clicking for a
magazine especially if you haven't done
it in a long time and I don't know if
I'm going to buy you as a magazine
because that's how much that that was
free that was free my look fantastic
beauty blogs actually and I'll link it
down below but some of them I like six
seven pounds I'm I really really however
it was nice you know
so I advise it for me I hoped you
enjoyed that favorite it feels quite
nice to sit down and just talk about
product and there's some people who just
genuinely like these kind of videos
including myself you know some things
just got to do it when I say people
watching and I'll see you later
I
