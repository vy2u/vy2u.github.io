putting this effort in you were created
whole and complete hey guys welcome to
my channel today i have another virgin
journals for you and I'm feeling really
good with myself because I feel like
I've been relatively consistent in my
last video I did how to edit Instagram
pictures which I personally really liked
the video and it inspired a lot of
conversation and in some cases
controversy but personally I think it's
really important for conversation to
happen and I'm the kind of person I
don't mind laying my cards out on the
table because I don't feel like I feel
like honesty is never a bad thing and
it's always good to share as much as you
possibly can you can take it as you want
or leave it as you want but personally
I've been loving it and loving all your
love and support but today I wanted to
talk about relationships and
specifically the fact that relationships
are not gold and I thought it was really
important to just kind of have a chat
about this is specifically for my single
ladies who are out there but also my
women who are in relationships who maybe
feel like they might be losing
themselves or have lost themselves or
have such a high expectation or
benchmark when it comes to relationships
and maybe don't feel like they are
meeting it and I know people might look
at me and say that's easy for someone
like need to say in which it probably is
because I have been in a relationship
for going on almost 10 years as it
currently stands if not 10 years you
know 10 years and I am married but I
feel like that's given me quite a lot of
insight into relationship as well as
I've seen countless women that I know
around me who've been in good
relationship bad relationships no
relationships on the hunt for
relationships given up on relationships
so I just wanted to give you guys a
little bit of just there just a little
bit of a pep talk you know just just to
feel good or just you know some insight
really when it comes to relationships
and why they're not actually gold so
number one all that glitters is not gold
and I think this is so important for
people to realize people look at
relationships and think that once I have
a man
once I have a woman my life is going to
be set you know things are going to be
great from here on out because you have
that person to you know complete you or
to add to your life and the reality is
that this is not the case you can look
at a relationship from the outside and
see you know at grand gestures and
amazing things and kisses and think oh
my gosh that's amazing
but trust me all that glitters is not
gold you never know what is going on
inside that relationship and for matter
of fact there's ups there is downs
there's plateaus those fights there's
passion there's lots of different things
that happen and you have the arch
yourself is that one of the things that
you're ready and prepared for when
you're in a relationship and also for
those who are in relationships don't
look at other relationships and think I
wish my relationship was like that
because again you don't know what's
happening and as they say the grass is
not always greener on the other side
it's green where it's being watered I
like that one so point number two
relationships take a work in my opinion
and maybe this is because I'm a little
bit old school and I'm not the most
romantic person in the world but
relationships and love is actually a
choice it's about two people coming
together and making a decision and
choosing to work through the ups through
the downs through the compromises
through the strife through the changes
through the big decisions and it's not
just the case of you know I mean have
googly eyes that eventually kind of
wanes off and after that googly eyed
moment is there you need stability you
need muscle you need time you need
effort you need sacrifice to really make
love and relationships work and I say to
the single people out there while you're
kind of not in a relationship it's a
great time to use all that effort and
that work and that kind of working out
time on yourself to build yourself to be
the strongest person that you can be who
is feeling whole as themselves and
before trying to share it and spread
this out to someone else because it can
get very tiring being a relationship
if you yourself are not even strong
enough as an individual and also the
fact that it takes work it's really
important to be in a relationship with
someone who's also willing to put in the
amount of what that you're willing to
put in a relationship is one of those
things that is about equilibrium if I'm
putting this effort in you need to be
putting this effort in and it's not by
force I'm not going to make someone do
it both individuals and parties have to
be making that choice they kind of keep
the playing field balanced but if one
person is putting in all the effort and
the other is not eventually what you
have is kind of a skew whiff
relationship that eventually won't hit
the long run so effort and work baby's
evident work so my third point is that
you are enough I I personally don't like
it when people say this person completes
me you know I need to be in relationship
so I can be still whole and feel
complete you have to realize as an
individual that you were created whole
and complete you are not half a person
half a spirit just because you don't
have another person besides you oh heck
no if that's how you're thinking you
probably need to go back to the drawing
board reassess yourself and take some
time to just get a little bit of
self-love you are genuinely whole as an
individual in relationship your partner
does not complete you but compliment you
it's all about what you can add to the
table the others of the other person and
what that other person can also add to
your table to really create a
bountifulness that overflows not a case
of something was missing or is missing
from you as an individual rather that it
will be nice to have something extra
there that just adds more spice to life
you know so what you can find in lots of
relationships especially if they're a
bit dysfunctional is that there's an
individual or someone in the
relationship or both who don't feel like
they're enough and sometimes they become
you know a little bit they don't value
themselves as much as they possibly
should and then they get walked all over
the reality is that you are enough and
that if you do
I feel like you are then it's better off
to take the time in building yourself
being the best you building that
confidence before you fly and jump into
a relationship that isn't going to make
you feel complete my fourth and final
point is that love is a goal and I am
one of these avid people who loves the
concept of love and love is more than
just about the attraction that you feel
to a person of the opposite sex or
someone who you feel attracted to love
is beyond that it's a beautiful thing
that sometimes you can experience
through nature and you can experience
through people you can experience for
you personally sacrificing for someone
else and you can experience through
charity and I think it's important to
realize the way that love is sometimes
perceived in this society is very or in
this day in age is actually quite narrow
and when you kind of experience the
fullness of love it means that you'll be
able to bring something more valuable
when you do end up or may not end up
being in a relationship with another
individual for the rest of your life if
you choose to so guys that is my virgin
journal so for today you see the passion
as it always comes back with me I hope
you guys enjoyed that and I kind of just
wanted to share my thoughts on and mean
relationships and that good stuff and
I'm totally for relationships I love
them I love love as I've just mentioned
but you know what it's not goals there's
so much to life and when you remember
that eventually I feel like
relationships come it just comes easily
because you're not that kind of thirst
trap person desperately you know
googly-eyed looking for this version of
relationship and version of love that
actually isn't realistic in the long run
so guys thank you so much for watching
and I will catch you in my next video
and thoughts below you guys know I love
when reading all the comments and seeing
the conversation so I can't wait to hear
what you guys have to say bye 100 these
are basically all I used to take photo
can bring that dent out which is a demo
always had I don't mind it I can you see
one make it look bright</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
