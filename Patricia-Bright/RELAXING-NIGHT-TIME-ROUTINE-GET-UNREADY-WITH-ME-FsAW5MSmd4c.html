down and I'm going to share with you my
relaxing evening routine and lots of you
have asked about this so I hope you
enjoy so usually I walk through the door
and it's kind of like a habit I just
dropped my keys run up the stairs
and the first thing I want to do is take
my makeup off I wear my silky dressing
down because it always makes me feel
good when I'm at home tie my hair up and
basically I just want to get rid of the
grime that's on my face all day there's
nothing like taking off my eyelashes
which feels like removing a good bra you
guys know that feeling it feels so good
I might go ahead and begin my cleansing
process I am using it the Nivea micellar
solution it's a three-in-one cleansing
water you guys know that I absolutely
love cleansing waters for getting rid of
my makeup deep clean my skin and just
leaving me with a moisturizing feeling
for me this is the best way to take off
makeup really gently so if you have
sensitive skin solutions like this and
this new one olivia is an amazing
alternative to like using scrubs and
things that are a little bit harsher and
a great thing it does get your makeup
instantly off another trick is if you
want to avoid panda eyes and a q-tip is
a great way to kind of just roll it
along your lash line and you'll get nice
clear beautiful makeup free skin
so after that I would usually make my
way downstairs the first place I hate is
the kitchen and I love blueberries they
are my favorite snack and it's a great
healthy snack usually I'll just get a
Punnett of blueberries and I will go
through my facebook way Instagram my
Twitter all of that kind of stuff before
getting ready to go ahead and do dinner
dinner for me is quick and easy I need
to be able to throw it in the oven sweet
potato and chicken breast or salmon
either my dinner of choice because I'm
trying to be healthy but I haven't got
time to around with lots of
different things so if I am trying to
relax I love to paint my nails I usually
will watch some Netflix or something and
I will just play with different nail
polish colors and I've opted for this
kind of Daisy color with a bit of detail
I don't know I find doing my nails
super relaxing after that I will have a
cup of tea and sit down in front of the
telly with my hubby probably till the
rest of the evening goes by and then I
will make my way up to the bath and have
a relaxing bath I will put on to my
favourite kind of these are from Dipti
gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous and I have a
new one as well and yes I love a large
transform like everyone else
this one looks crazy right now but once
the waters flowing it's a lovely
gorgeous one and it smells delicious
and they always feel so moisturizing on
my skin this is a rose bath balm which
is actually for my Mother's Day kit and
I just love the bubbles and I basically
like to just chill out until I basically
prune for the next 30 minutes or so I
find it very relaxing before bed
now I met my way to my bedroom by this
point in time I am chilled out and ready
to fall asleep so again I'll just put my
mic at 19 something like that my
dressing-gown and I will roll into that
bed now I'm someone who sometimes
struggle with sleeping and I find that
having a little diary or a book or
somewhere that I can write stuff down
all the thoughts that are in my head
it's a great way to clear my mind before
sleeping if any of you guys struggle
with sleeping or anything like that
writing all the things that come into
your head and clear your mind and it
means that you won't be you know running
crazy throughout the night and put my
headscarf on and turn up at night and
that is my relaxing nighttime routine so
guys I hope you enjoy so you so much for
watching and I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
