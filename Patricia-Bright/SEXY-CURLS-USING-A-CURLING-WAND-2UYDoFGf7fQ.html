learn how to create sexy Victoria Secret
curls using the curling one I purchased
my phone boots you will need a brush
heat protective gloves and in flips to
section your hair so you want to section
your first part and I avoid putting heat
on my natural hair because I'm just
trying to protect it this part has been
previously cold because I tried before
that's my trusty heat proof glove we're
going to take a piece of hair kind of a
small section and wrap the piece around
the curling one
I made a bit of a mistake there
a smaller piece is a little better to
get really defined clothes what you'll
find that it takes no time at all to get
these curls you just have to leave it on
for about five seconds and release and
you get beautiful curls
you could do it you know different sizes
depending on the amount of hair you wear
depending on how high up and do it on
the one
so that's a little villainy to see
that's half and half done and this is my
completed look beautiful easy to do
curls my today my wand was only 24
pounds really cheap and I get glamorous
card like this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
