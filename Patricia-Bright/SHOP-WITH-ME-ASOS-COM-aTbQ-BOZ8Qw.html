video is going to be shop with me I
thought this was a really good idea to
do for some people who are a bit
concerned about shopping on the internet
and websites to shop from before you
know spending your money online you get
stuff that you don't really buy so
today's video is going to be on aids
Ofcom I'll show you how I navigate and
everything and things that can pick up
and then tapes and tricks that you can
get from shopping on a sitcom and if
there are any other websites that you
want me to review leave them down below
because I'm going to start doing them my
next review will be on top shop calm
boho calm as well anything else please
that need below and we can review them
so hope you enjoyed this video and I
hope it's helpful I think you're going
to need is obviously a laptop or
computer and I'm presuming if you're
watching this you probably have one and
the next thing you're gonna need is that
a nice area of what I like to do when I
shop online is to kind of separate
myself you know assume I'm actually
shopping put my shoes on and what
handbags a bit too much there they put
on a handbag and they just have a nice
beverage it wines a cup of tea I do love
my mr. Khan has a range of different
ways to navigate the website you can go
from interest from the front screen to
where you're able to shop for different
seasons trend and this is this element
here I think is written by professional
people from magazines and you get an
idea to have a look at the Edit and what
they think is fashionable and in trends
most of the time I do think it is crap
but you can go ahead and have a look
through this and you can shop a
particular trend such as the crutch that
was being shown or you can shop the
entire edit so everything that the
designer all the editor for a magazine
thinks is in fashion another great thing
about this website is you can shop by
outfits and looks and it seems that this
area is
ten created by people who are interested
in fashion people who put together
different looks and styles and put their
outfits together so you can see that
this has been done this anyone how to
look here has been done by fluorescents
which is kind of like almost like a
YouTube lookbook account or or you know
people are just interested in showing
their different trends and you can see
that there are other comments on these
so it's a great way if you want to see
what other people think about fashion
and how they put outfits together you
can do so a Descamps has recently
created this thing for called
marketplace I'm not necessarily sure if
it is open to all nations but definitely
in the UK and these are people who have
their own products and their own styles
and clothing and you can actually come
in here and purchase their goods they
they you know provide aids or some kind
of fee to sign up and then they're
allowed to sell their own clothing that
they make or they have manufactured and
I actually think that this is a really
great element of the website and its
really putting the fashion world back
into the hands of the people who are
actually interested in it and this is
one thing I think that sets apart a
sauce from any other website right now
they're really really fashion forward in
terms of really interactive and engaging
with the people all these people that
you see here are just everyday people
who have their own you know stores or
are interested in freshening themselves
so as us you know have the standard you
know shop by women the new in clothing
accessories and stuff and it's really
important that any website that's out
there divide this you know their stuff
up they have so much clothing on here it
is crazy and I'm the type of person the
first thing I go to is dresses and to be
honest that's just because I love
dresses but you'll see that there are
1482 styles
that's a heck of a lot of dresses and
right now it shows you 20 per page but
you can increase that too
200 pipe if you show up on the website
in law newing is the bait great way to
see what the new trends coming in
that's what or they would have purchased
so purchasing items are really easy you
can just click on the item that you're
interested in and you can add it to your
bag
obviously I've already signed into my
account so it automatically goes in
create an account is really easy to do
all you need is your email address and
you can set that up I don't think you
can shop without an account so as us
actually stop their own brand products
and other brand proper products so what
you can see from these collection of
tights here is let's have their own
style so I'm quite interested in two in
one particular pair this star pair I'm
just gonna add this to my bag but you
can go back into those collections and
also find a pair of Henry Holland House
of Holland tights as well once you
finish shopping and put all the items
you wanted in your shopping bag what you
get to see is your totals and when you
spend a certain amount on a Zeus comm
you qualify for certain things so you
can qualify for standard delivery or
next working day delivery depending on
if you have spent over seventy five
pounds so the great thing is that you
can get to your order summary and you
can add in either give vouchers or promo
codes or if you have a student account
you can get your discount if your member
took a this is premium account they
actually give you a discount code once
in a while and there is actually a
discount code for this month however I
can't I don't think I can tell you guys
cuz it doesn't work for every account
anyway so I've added in my promo code
and I've been able to have a massive
discount of about forty pounds as you
can see
I've been taken off my total so once
again it's easy to do and to navigate so
we'll wait and see my whole video from
this shop I also didn't discuss the self
section which is massive and is very
easy to navigate
