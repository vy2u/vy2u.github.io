I've got this look here for you and I'm
feeling all kinds of like cutesy and
quite innocent looking I feel like it's
a really nice casual date night look and
I try to make sure everything was
affordable but besides that I've been
really good at kind of achieving it and
to be honest usually when I'm on YouTube
I do it much more like glam look good
lashes and everything but it's quite
nice to do something that's a little bit
more natural but I use the new stand on
the eyes reloaded mascara from Rimmel
they did send it to me alongside this
top-secret case with a bunch of things
in neg even like a mirror that lights up
a pen that has got a little camera in it
as well as the mascara runs on the bits
and bobs and like I had a challenge and
I've decided to create this look right
here but to be able to do something a
little bit different was nice so I'm
feeling it like oh my gosh so innocent
butter with it melt well you guys know
got a little of my B side hey guys I
hope you enjoyed this tutorial and I'll
catch you very soon so let's get started
probably notice that these are my
natural eye brows I finally had them
done it's been a long time coming shop
Cora Patricia has eyebrows that look
slightly respectable I do think they
look a little bit thin so I'm going to
go in with Rimmel's brow this way and
I'm going to use the gel first to kind
of thicken them out and lengthen them
and then believe the powder and it's so
much easier to do my brows now that
they're just not picky because before my
eyes that have basically been picky for
two years two years straight just had
stray hairs all up on the outside like
they were just sorry but I wanted to
grow my brows out so I could have
eyebrows at just one tweaks you that gel
is giving me all kinds of life
oh yes I've gone back to real long hair
we'll talk about it in another thing now
I'm going to add the powder as well and
I like to use a spoolie to add the
powder just to give it a bit more of a
natural finish and so my eyebrows look
like they don't even need concealer on
the outside it's crazy
so my concealer was basically conceding
just roughness I realize they didn't
prime my face but I'm going to use the
fix and perfect Rimmel and makeup primer
my skin has not been up 100 at the
moment but I'm about to work on reliving
my good routines as I used to do them so
seeing as this is meant to be affordable
I'm going to go in with my la girl Pro
concealer they're not going to lie it's
not my favorite and it really is a bit
thick but with a damp Beauty Blender you
can cut you can make it work you know
nice little yellow doesn't it
nice little yellow I'm actually just
going to highlight my nose using an
angle brush and I know a lot of people
suggested that I've had a nose job I
haven't exactly just contour if I did
have a nose job I would tell you guys I
chose you I did it for me my favorite
foundation is the Lancome ten I doll
along with the wire cell as well but
this is my comment like go two innings
it's been four for a while and I have a
darker mouth area so I'm just gonna jab
jab jab
aha and the brushes I'm using are from
the B the B Beauty range which is from
Superdrug which is a drugstore range and
they are again affordable and they're
very very good brushes I have them all
linked below but genuinely I'm really a
fan they come like this if you're ever
wondering about these brushes
you
I'm going to go in with the darkest
color to contour
alright next I'm going to go in with the
flat contour brush and I'm just going to
use my Sacha powder it's not necessarily
drugstore but it's not bad in price for
how much you get and basically how long
it lasts and I really like this brush
because of the shape of it it's got a
really good angle for under-eye
okay let's get to the important part
the are eyes right I'm going in with
Rimmel's magnetic eyes and this
eyeshadow color is basically it's like
an eye contour and palate
you can see it's got a really kind of
more I don't know at blilie eyeshadow
colors which is a bit different for me
but I still think you can make it work
for an everyday basis and I'm going to
go in with this gorgeous cool gold on my
lid I'm just going to tap that on my lid
and I have really small eyelids I'd like
to kind of take up the gold just a bit
to kind of create a bigger eyelid and I
swear that my eyelids are getting
wrinkly are getting older you know guys
but I only look 21 don't play me I'm
actually going to go in with the brown
from the brown this way and use it as
kind of a crease color and that's why
I've got one thing about makeup you
don't have to use you know actual
products in their actual way you can use
them in a way that works for you this is
like the perfect brown for like your
eyelids and then I'm going in with the
skies and I've reloaded from Rimmel and
I'm not wearing last year's so the
mascara needs to do its work and I feel
like it's nice to once in a while give
your eyelashes a break and I've got
little baby lashes so sometimes I like
to just take it down and twist it up and
this mascara is great at giving you just
an extra volume
slave baby lashes slow
all right so either my baby lashes can
come through like how cute does it look
like not wearing and not wearing
eyeliner or eye lashes like this is such
a natural neutral look but I mean okay I
feel really innocent like how innocent
do I look all right well let's get rid
of the innocence and let's do a little
bit of highlighting and contouring but
so I'm going to go in with my blush
I'm going to be naughty the highlight
I'm using is a current highlight to a
favorite of mine and it's not affordable
I'm sorry guys but it's the tongue
forward shimmer shot nugget it's like a
liquid highlight I think about it it's
just so gentle and a little goes a long
way right so I'm going to stick with a
kind of innocent doll look and I'm going
to go in with this color here which is
good thoughtful which is it very
innocent girl but I'm loving it and it's
super affordable
you kind of got it later on as well and
I've been dealing with some
discoloration on my lips because I
recently had an awful allergic reaction
and when it was Krusty for like a week
and then it's just recovering now so
guys that is my finished look and I feel
like I definitely look like butter
wouldn't melt I don't know if you guys
agree or not but sometimes it's nice to
do like a gentle everyday look but it's
kind of like that little sneakiness and
loving the natural eyelashes Oh Mike I
should do it in a little bit more but
only if I've got the puzzle SCARA to do
it but yeah guys I hope you enjoyed and
I will see you very soon thanks for
watching guys I
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
