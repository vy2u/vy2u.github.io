makeup look this is one of my most
requested makeup looks people always ask
me what lipstick you're wearing what
eyeliner you're wearing all that stuff
is gonna be included in this video I'll
put a description of all the stuff in
the bottom and there's my link to my
facebook my Instagram icon dude my
Twitter guys I answer loads of questions
over there and I'm always interacting
and actually I love you guys joining me
and follow me because then I can get
good ideas of what to do next so this is
definitely your crest from you guys so
hope you enjoy it and it's really easy
to follow my eye so I start off with a
clean and moisturized face before I put
on my makeup I go ahead and apply my
foundation with a stippling brush I know
the common looks a bit off it's a match
masters 8.5 but it really does settle in
lovely I then go ahead and focus on my
brows they're a bit wild I'd say I like
to brush them into place and apply a
brown pencil just with light strokes to
give me the ideal shape which is quite
thick and quite square that's what I
really like and I use the brush just to
make sure it doesn't look too harsh so
concealer is a key part of my look I use
it under my brows just to add some
definition now use under my eyes as well
just to give me that glow and give my
face some extra depth and highlight
oh so apply concealer to the bridge of
my nose lightly just for some extra
light and definition I love it and I'm
using a Pitt purpley pink blush that I
love like see I go little bit wild blush
and you guys have been asking me loads
about what's been on my lips well this
is it it's from sleek and I love it I
use a line art to add color to my lips
it lasts all day it is a babydoll pink
but I love it blend it in with my finger
and it's perfect I had a touch of Barry
M just to make the color a bit more
vivid so another thing that's been
really popular is this blue eyeliner
it's so cheap guys I'll describe what it
is in the bottom bar again and it's from
super drug and I pry it to my bottom
waterline and it just gives my eyes that
pop I finish off with liquid liner and I
always incorporate a flick because I
think it's just flirty and finally I
always top up with some mascara just on
the outside corner it makes my eyes look
a lot bigger and that is my kind of
popular makeup look done and dusted so I
hope you enjoyed there and remember to
