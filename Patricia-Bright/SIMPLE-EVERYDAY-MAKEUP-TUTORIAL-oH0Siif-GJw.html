be like a basic foundation just basics
routine basically but it's how many
times gonna say basically many many more
just because I felt like some people who
would really like direction in terms of
like that kind of base makeup routine
but sometimes some of the cheaters can
be a bit much and there may be a lot of
layers and this step and this step and
this step and for me I don't do all of
that mine is really really basic and I
think I get a decent finish
so hopefully this kind of gives you guys
who are maybe a bit more new to the
whole makeup thing an idea of the steps
to take and the key is you need so you
don't need a massive collection but you
might just need four brushes and three
main base products or something so
hopefully I should be able to convey
that in this video guys so here I am
fresh-faced and I just wanted to show
you how I usually do my makeup and so if
they like keep changing I don't control
the Sun but basically this is all the
makeup I own in terms of like the
foundation and concealers and stuff like
that I don't have a massive collection
at all and I use the same products and
when I'm done with them I just go buy
the same product again but I just keep
it in a tray like this left fund it's a
really comfortable way to just get ready
really quickly and create minimal mess
so the first thing I would usually do
would be to start off with a moisturized
face I'm sure I don't need to tell you
guys that but it really does make a
difference in how your foundation sits
on your face and the next step would be
to add something like a primer to be
totally honest with you I don't do it
everyday luxury makeups it and it also
makes your pores look smaller this
product is by benefit and it's called
pore fessional
I just add a light layer to my face and
I focus on my nose because I have quite
large pores there the next step is for
me is to conceal because I do this whole
three-step concealing and I go two
shades lighter and my skin and if it's
for work I will just go with something
that is just like maybe my actual color
but for videos and stuff from going out
I go two shades lighter because it gives
you that kind of glow in depth so you
can see how much different it looks that
either looks like a big black bag and a
lot of people do the whole kind of take
you up their nose in the top of the head
and just above their lip I don't do that
much because I'm not a massive contour
but it is nice if you want to create
some dimension to your face and you can
always add wore less depending on how
natural you want to look one that you
want to look so the next step would be
to apply a foundation and a lot of
people get a bit confused about what
brushes they should use if there's some
people who've got just loads and loads
of brushes and it's just like oh my gosh
personally I think the only brush that
you really need is a duo fibre brush
like the this.f 20 which is from Sigma
but this will give you really light
coverage and it means that you don't
have to think so much when they're doing
it but you'll see that literally I can
like rub this in here or even don't like
the foundation of my face actually
I can just buff that in
so you'll see that it kind of evens my I
still have this highlight here so I
don't look really many flying after you
apply like all that foundation and stuff
you probably want to set it I've just
started using this been and why banana
stuff I don't think it's that good but
I'm gonna use it right now
prior to that I used to just use and Max
I'm gonna relies in the eight point five
but I'm going to use one of these little
sponges and I'm just gonna just dip it
up with that doesn't add any color but
it really does help to set that on
dialogue this is where you probably want
to use another brush and I'm going to
use the Mac Studio Fix and this is in my
not actual shade I'm gonna get a really
big power to brush and this is the f30
and this is so that I don't look powdery
but you just don't want to set it
lightly so I just do it really lightly
some that stuff is the whole contouring
and highlighting and I don't do this on
an everyday basis but with them going
out definitely so I'm just going to use
and the sleek face contour kit in the
dark and it's the CC action just across
here so see it makes me look a little
bit more defined so to highlight I'm
going to use this illuminated from NARS
and it's the super orgasmic now finally
I would just add a blush with a kabuki
brush or just another blush brush I've
probably used that one to be honest you
but if you want to switch up your
brushes and this is a color called
Sahara by sleek might use this all the
time I always get too much wrong so well
like that is like my foundation and like
base face routine which i think is
really perfect for those of you who are
looking for like an everyday look for
school or for work or something like
that but I'm gonna go ahead and do the
rest of my face but if you want to see
like a slowed down version
that and do let me know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
