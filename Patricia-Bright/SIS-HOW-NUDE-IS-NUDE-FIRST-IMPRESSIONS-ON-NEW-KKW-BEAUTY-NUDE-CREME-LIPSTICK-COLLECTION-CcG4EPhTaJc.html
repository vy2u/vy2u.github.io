just don't do it with that beautiful
people welcome back to my channel I hope
you are doing well today I am coming to
you bear not their face naturally I'm
commenting you dry on it because it girl
is about to apply something new and i
have the new kk w beauty lip cream and
this is the first time i've received any
PR from k'kaw beauty and since when I
got a DM I was a bit like have you got
the wrong person like excuse me I have
been very honest of my thoughts of some
of the items that I've bought from k'kaw
beauty some have been really good some
haven't been amazing some didn't always
work for me when it came to shade some
really cool somewhere not right and I
haven't reviewed anything in a fair bit
so when I got this I was like you know
what I really really wanted to try it
out especially because you know one
definition of a nude is very different
to another definition of nude some
people's nude is like some peachy pinky
something that makes me look like death
walking and then my version of nude is
more like a warm chocolate kind of thing
and when I saw this collection I was
like oh okay well we are trying to work
this so I wanted to try it out I'm gonna
swatch all of their believe this eight
different shades in here there's three
different liners I've got two of the
liners I want to swatch them and see if
I look good in the nudes so if you've
already subscribed you can subscribe if
you want to but there is no pressure and
also you've got my Instagram and my
snapchat and my Twitter I'll have that
all down below but can we get right into
it please let's do this this is a
classic k'kaw Beauty Collection it's got
that new that clear that minimalistic
vibe what I say is that Kim has been
really consistent when it comes to the
packaging and design my genuinely feel
like it's very her I am getting a little
bit over just in general and beauty the
kind of new
and I'm wanting to see some like a meal
I'm like we need some meal and the
Patricia bright Beauty coming out real
soon but one thing I'll say is that the
brand is consistent this lip kit here
which contains all eight lippies is a
cool 144 dollars Wow it's a cool 144
dollars if you felt like you needed all
eight nude if you are a collector type
person then that's a lot of money but
you know if you're a fan it might be for
you I think that most people are just
gonna buy one to three different
individuals and a liner I think it's
really nice I like the shape I like the
vibe it's very cool and very collector
so this individual item costs 18 pounds
and I've got to say it's kind of dinky
it's kind of small
I don't know open up just yeah and then
we also have the lip liners these go for
$12 there are three different liners and
I was impressed because there's a light
line are a medium liner and a dark liner
the one thing I find when it comes to
Linus is that I can never get a liner
dark enough and I only use matte
chestnut and bittersweet those are my
best liners and I've also got an amazing
one from Bobbi Brown in chocolate those
are like my only three liners in the
market that work amazingly for me so
here the two liners this is shade number
two and shade number one I mean one I'm
not I'm not sure about one of me
it's not even as ash as I thought it
would be obviously this isn't the kind
of shade I would normally wear but I
don't hate this it's very creamy glides
on really well but this is the shade I
was excited about Oh for me that's a
really nice Brown I can go a smidgen
darker but to be honest it's good it's
almost got a hint of warmth to it like a
hint of red rather than a hint of casket
so I want a little more a little bit
more punch a little bit more punch maybe
a touch but it isn't bad know what let's
take the shades in numerical order
this is shade number one which is giving
me peachy nude I'm not sure how it's
gonna look for me but let's let's get
going
no idea what this fit formula is but
obviously it's called a cream lipstick
mm-hmm I need some sunglasses for this
this shade no amount of work is gonna
bring me back from the grave even with
the brown liner to light for me
obviously but that shade number one
which is going to be a perfect nude for
someone else the thing I will say is
that it's not as pink as I thought it
was gonna be it's actually quite a
neutral nude which is surprising it
doesn't look that neutral but it's quite
neutral might have been the base I've
got underneath Cass get ready people
great in all honesty I don't expect
shades one two three to be wearable
shades for me but I think three to five
I'm excited about
okay let's try try shade number two mmm
so the difference between shade number
one and shade number two is this has a
bit more orange in it it's a bit warmer
than this one so say this was quite
neutral
this one's warmer but it's still ashy on
me next up we're going nude number three
this shade looks right up my street
actually if I'm gonna go for my light my
pay or my pay your nude look not a nude
look that's when to blend with me but
like when I'm going right up I would
probably go for a shade like this
mmm well that's nice it's really creamy
I feel like this one feels creepier than
the other ones I don't know that's in my
head but it feels a bit more creamier
because the others I felt like they were
kind of settling into the lines of my
lips but this one feels a bit more
creamy and smooth the worst thing is
when my lipstick settles in to your
Kratz and you look like a desert
especially if it's nude in color there
were going into a territory that I like
this one with the power of my liner I'm
good and from here on the nudes get
darker and darker can I get away with
this without a liner maybe should we do
it mm I really like that shade but you
can see why I always wear a liner I feel
like I look ridiculous when I don't wear
lip liner and wear a light color or
lighter color but I feel like I can
almost almost get away with this without
a liner but you know the black community
I probably shouting at me like no but
just don't do it word night lipstick
without eyeliner and my really is
sacrilege like you don't do it you don't
did but this colors a nice very nice
feeling creamy giving me a classic
lipstick I wonder what it feels like
when you wear I think I'm gonna do a
wear test for the end of this video
added a little liner I feel like there
we go there we go I can wear it like
this I can wear it like this and I like
it I wouldn't normally do this in all
honesty I wouldn't normally mmm feels
very nice feels almost like a
moisturizing balm it's shiny not shiny
it's not a gloss it's a sheen it's a
creme okay so five isn't darker than
four it's like a different hue it's more
like a pink
I wouldn't call this a nude I'd call
this a pink and I mean I feel like my
lips look a little bit like in English
so no no not this shade that's how the
liner do you guys see the power of line
out on me right on my chocolate listen I
can go from looking like an anus to
looking like a guy oh if you like I need
to sing like a song like the power of
liner look at that I like it now
quite pinky though it's quite pinky this
was a new this is a pink but it's a pink
I'm here for we are on nude number six a
nude number six has gone darker oh it's
a bit rookie it's a little bit bricky
which I actually really like hmm so this
is what it looks like without a liner I
feel like a liners going to take it to
the next level so it doesn't look
strange on me cuz sometimes shades can
be a little bit too close to your skin
tone but I think it's a really nice
color watch what the liner will do to
this honestly
I'm really really really really really
like it's a little bit gritty nude it's
almost like a burnt burnt ready brown
nude but for me this is a good color
nude you know this is a good color nude
really wonder how these last that's a
real important question these feel good
on my lips what do you guys think okay
nude number seven we get in a bit darker
this looks way more on the neutral side
quite similar to six these two are
virtually are they virtually the same
can we compare side by side if you like
they're almost the same color this is
still on the brick aside but darker I
think I slightly prefer this one
actually oh I like this one more I think
it's less brookie
more nudie ah it's bringing that to the
nineties oh and the last shade on this
spectrum which I feel like it's a big
jump it's a big jump from here to here
look at that I can have this and it's
like all the way
well okay so this is this shade I like
it I love a dark brown yo girl
it's got her own little something coming
coming really really soon but um for
some reason this always has a bit of a
green tinge to it
what is that in my head it could be my
lighting versus more warmth to it it's
not bad but I don't think this looks
nice on me personally but I like the way
how shiny is can you see how shiny it is
almost like a gloss gotta say these do
you feel great I feel like wood going
back to that classic feeling of a
lipstick that feels good on your lips
like nourishing okay
I'm done I'm gonna go back in with this
shade that I like the most and give you
my final final thoughts
okay I'm back so final final thoughts
I love the liner number three the dark
line art is a really good liner to wear
with light shades or other shades when
you wanna do a contrast in it that's the
one thing I think is missing the most in
the market right no one's been doing it
besides a Mac killing it with chestnut
and bittersweet those two are still my
absolute favorite when it comes to
liners but this is a really good
alternative when it comes to the shades
favorite shade was number three and
number six and actually like number four
as well because I had to like the pinky
the pinky thing going on I think it's
really nice that you know k'kaw booty is
coming out with a diverse range of the
nudes because I know how hard it is to
find that perfect nude what your nude
could look like death on me so I'll give
you a little clap for that girl in terms
of the way they feel nice classic but
they're more like the cream is like
neither a matte lipstick neither a gloss
but it's kind of shiny so it I don't
know where I sit with it I don't know if
I feel like I wanted it to be matte
everyone in it to be gloss you know I
don't know your girls not really sure
yet but they still feel nice and I feel
like you can wear them all the time I
know a lot of us are still like you know
kkw it's like problematic but to be
honest judging from the product I really
like to see how
the brand has been going from strength
to strength and really like developing
itself further and taking on you know
consideration because I remember when I
tried like the Kim Kardashian range with
Kylie those lip those lip creams it was
death becomes her it was it was dust it
was ash it was gray well as this is not
that's got warmth of richness and a
variety which so yeah what do you guys
sing are you gonna be picking up any
other collection I do not think anyone
needs to spend a hundred and forty
pounds on the whole set unless you're a
fan actually death do you think someone
because if you're someone who's really
pale you can go from the really light
one to the really dark one it does I
don't think it works the other way
around probably a model could do it and
look flawless but meet now no um well
yeah I definitely think that for my
shade three four six and seven as well I
really like eight it's giving me kind of
green and I think there's nice
alternatives um so guys that isn't my
take
what's your take are you picking up any
goodies from k'kaw beauty what's your
thoughts on Beauty at the moment as well
do you feel like there's just a lot
coming out I want to know down below but
in the meantime I'll catch you guys
later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
