do an updated skincare routine video and
I feel like people have been asking me
to do a skincare video for ages and I
don't quite know why I haven't done it
this whole time I usually do them if you
don't know skincare is literally my
favorite thing like it's on a part of
beauty it might even slightly be a bug
because I absolutely love skincare and I
usually do these videos but I just
haven't done it for so long but I wanted
today to do a video finally to help new
ladies who are battling the large pores
on even skin tone or just wanting that
glow so I'm going to share with you
about some specific tips that I
genuinely apply and also some of my
product favourites that I use and I'm
not going to lie I use a lot of products
I am a product junkie I buy skincare
like it's going out of fashion I've only
got one face but it doesn't stop me
it's like wreck I do find that sometimes
your skin can get used to something so
it's worthwhile switching up so I want
to share with you some of the ones I'm
really loving at the moment and just
some of the key steps that I use to
battle some of my skincare problems so
the first thing I wanted to share with
you is just a little bit about my skin
so I'm not going to sit here and say
that I've had problem skin and now my
skin's amazing and glowy if you don't
know I'm currently pregnant and it's
given me an amazing glow I'm not going
to lie my skin is so smooth and buttery
at the word and even without makeup on
it's really really good but my main
problem has always been
hyperpigmentation so where I've marked
from spots in the past and they've left
dark marks and I have like a darker area
around here and also a large pores on my
nose and it's not just large pores it's
more like sebaceous filament so their
pores that basically get quite filled
with gunk
not necessarily whiteheads that go black
but they more kind of stay under the
skin and they are something that I have
to continually manage so the thing about
pause is that you can never get rid of
them but you can definitely in
the way they look and manage them so the
first routine I'm going to share with
you is my poor busting routine first
step is to cleanse and I like to have a
gentle cleanser so anything from I've
got really nice morel cleanser I love
simple cleansers as well for when I'm
going to do this specific routine and I
also have the osaki a London perfect
cleanser which is a cleansing and
nourishing balm so a cleanser that isn't
too harsh it's going to be a great one
to start off with the next steps are now
to treat and the treatment is basically
two part the first part of treatment is
basically using something that contains
salicylic acid at the right percentage
2% is really good but also it should be
at the right pH but I talk about the
Paula's Choice I love their salicylic
acid based products and their glycolic
acid based products which are absolutely
amazing because I know that they're at
the right pH and no there's no other bad
things in there but anything with
salicylic acid at the right percent is
going to be amazing because salicylic
acid can basically get into your pore
and suck out all those nasties and it
really does kind of break it down get
underneath the skin there and just kind
of refresh and if you find that you've
got spores that get filled out mine get
filled out this is what I have to do to
get it all out and to cause them to
become smaller and smoother the step
after that is then to use a clay mask so
there are people who say you can put
salicylic treatment on so I've a liquid
treatment or wash of treatment leave it
on and then put clay on top of it clay
is excellent at also extracting pores
and also just clarifying and purifying
your skin I always talk about the
warming mineral clay masks on the body
shop because it's an excellent and
affordable product and really does work
I also have another product from Peter
Thomas which is the Irish more mud
purifying black mask and I think it just
looks really cool but again mud and clay
oh it's like a combo in heaven when it
to pause anything clay with salicylic
acid we'll just set your pause free the
next step after that is basically to
wash off and I think it's great to use
an emulsifying type of cleanser to wash
off because it's less stripping than
using a cleanser that kind of stripped
your skin back I have the evil arm
cleansing cream which again is quite a
pricy product as well I have some other
ones I use a Tom Ford emulsify as well I
think that most of my most defining
products or white cream cleansers are
quite pricey I'll see if I can link an
affordable alternative in the
description bar below if you do those
four steps you'll see a difference in
your pore size almost instantly because
that kind of salicylic then clay and
washing off and cause lots of grime to
come off and then cause a shrinking and
it's something you can repeat every 5 to
7 days depending on how filled up your
pores get but the key thing is to keep
them nice and clean avoid grime and dirt
in them so my next routine is for that
glow and also for even skin tone again
something that I always want I hate
looking dull I love to look kind of a
radiant and I have had hyperpigmentation
in the past especially if I've had marks
some old spots that I've kind of I don't
know discipline left like scars on me
and also in general just have kind of
darker areas on my face because that's
just what happened so the first step is
to cleanse and I think it's fine to go
with a gentle cleanser because we're
going to do some things that are a
little bit more complicated further down
the line so the next step is to ex
foliate and there's two ways to
exfoliate it's physical and it is
chemical and I like to combine the two
but everything has to be done in
moderation so when it comes to physical
its products that contain either beads
or grains in it I've got the tattoo
Harper regenerating cleanser which is a
daily exfoliating and clarifying
cleanser and there are beads in this but
they're not too rough which is why I
know you can use it daily but I think
that sometimes it's not so good to use
the beads because it can kind of scratch
your skin and I don't think it's a good
idea to do that right
Ginley or you can use something like a
face brush which I love this one is from
vanity planet it is the spin for perfect
skin and I love face brushes like this
because basically they're very very
gentle this one has four different heads
and what it does it kind of brightens
your skin it gets rid of some of those
dead skin cells and it basically causes
a smoothening and I don't know a
revealing of some gorgeousness
underneath but in a very gentle way some
people have even found that using face
brushes can actually decrease their pore
sizes and really just helps that
cleansing and I generally think it works
wonders
and then the next way to exfoliate is
chemicals and this is by using other
forms of acid and I think that you know
there are ways that you can go to like a
facial place and get acids put in your
face
it sounds really scary but I'm talking
about like lactic acid and I call it
massive but I think that there are
products on the market that are just as
good so I've talked about Paula's Choice
there alpha alpha H liquid gold with a
glycolic acid is absolutely excellent as
well and anything that contains glycolic
acid at the right percentage and without
too many other ingredients in them is
going to be a great way to chemically
exfoliate your face or you can go for
treatments but what you really want to
do is kind of get rid of all the old so
using a brush and using acids will
really help to kind of get rid of the
old tool now whatever you use on your
face next to actually penetrate now with
all these things don't overdo it don't
exfoliate everyday actually let your
skin get used to it it might be
something you only do once a week or
twice a week or for special occasions
finally specifically when it comes to
evening out skin tone my number one
answer is a vitamin C vitamin C is a
natural bitumen clearly all vitamins are
natural you can find it in lemon and you
can find it in lime and you can find it
in products that are really good and
some can say they contain vitamin C but
they don't necessarily contain them at
high enough percentages that are going
to make a difference or in the right
container that stops the vitamin C from
denaturing but even if you want to try
the lemon and lime treatments you can do
that but I would be careful but you can
get some redness and there's other stuff
like in the citrus fruit that can kind
of make you and kind of be a bit achy if
I be honest with you after that you want
to moisturize with an excellent
moisturizer because lots of these things
can be drying and sometimes they get a
bit worse before they get better but
when you get amazing results they are
amazing and finally Sun screen you don't
want to expose your skin treat your skin
and then not protect your skin sunscreen
is the icing on the cake that keeps all
the goodness in and keeps all the
badness out so make sure you use a
really good sunscreen I have one from
Paula's choice that I love to use as
well I also have a couple of others that
I'm going to link below I have so many
and I use them all year round and I
don't think it matters what color your
skin tone is in regards to using some
sunscreen it's important to everybody I
live in England where I'm not getting
very much vitamin D from the little bit
of Sun that we get here anyway so I'm
not worried about vitamin D deficiencies
and finally when you've done all these
treatments don't forget your eyes okay
your eyes are really important eyes are
where aging everything starts to show
first so I must are really important and
be very very gentle and avoid using
really heavy creams around your eyes
because that can cause more
wrinkles and bags and just make them
look even worse so guys those are my
skin care hats for large pores and
unevenness I hope you found it useful I
feel like it was a long video I was
talking for absolutely ages but I'm
going to try and edit it and I'm going
to link everything in the description
bar below and I will have a blog post
with much more detail on it as well as
some product outlines as well so I'll
have that all linked in the description
bar but I feel good I feel like I'm
doing something that I've really wanted
to do I finally wanted to help my people
out there have been asking me about some
skincare tips and I'm sorry for not
doing it so yeah there's anything else
you want me to talk about beauty related
life related then let me know in the
comments give this a thumbs up if you
found it useful and I'm
catch you later bye today we are talking
about how not to give a now I am NOT
someone who swears but I feel like this
was the word that had to be used for
this and I'm not going to use the word
throughout this video because it's just
not ladylike</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
