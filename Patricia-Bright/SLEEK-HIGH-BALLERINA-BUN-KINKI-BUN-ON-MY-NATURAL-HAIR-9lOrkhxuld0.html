my channel so I know I look a little bit
different today I'm gonna shake all this
fun that's a little bit been you know
just me to get this bum looking right
yeah it's a bit lopsided today I'm gonna
do a hair tutorial for those of you who
don't know I'm basically queen of the
weed like I wear a weave and extensions
like all the time but I've also been
like really embracing wearing out my own
natural hair and it's been really easy
it's been really really easy and my
favourite style and / the only style I
do is a high bun because it's so easy to
do and I find that kind of suits my face
and I have very thin to find her and my
hair just doesn't look nice it down like
I just don't like the way my hair looks
down unless it's really cut into a short
hairstyle this high bun that's very
miniature right now but I can make it
look much more dramatic in you know
enlarge I'm going to show you how I do
that this is what my hair basically
starts off with this is my hair after it
has been washed it has been conditioned
it has been blow-dried and it has been
straightened
I used this gel here this is actually a
hot gel that I stole for my husband it
is called super wax ultra strong and he
got it from a barber's and I don't know
what brand it is or anything but this is
better than any edge control I have ever
had so I kind of just get a little bit
like this it's this blue kind of waxy
texture and I kind of rub it from my
hands because it's just really round the
front that really needs it and just on
the nape I have one of these brushes
which my husband often refers to as a
dog brush but it's a great way to get
really nice really slick edges now I do
have to do it quite tight because then
it doesn't usually like to stay in place
and I will add a little bit more wax to
it because you got to get those
peppercorns you know some people have
baby hairs
some people have pepper cords I am of
the latter and the key thing is actually
um a headscarf okay for those of you who
are natural or have textured hair and
headscarf really is a great way to get
everything to lay for a good amount of
time
okay in the meantime I'm going to show
you how I create a pony I can either do
two kinds of pony one pony is where I
use kind of like a pinky type texture if
I want a really really big pony tail or
I can go for one that is more of a you
know straight texture and what I do is
in the middle I kind of get a piece of
hair like this and I basically wrap it
round the middle and then next I put
that at the back of my existing one and
then I pin that with a bobby pin and
that just kind of secures it into place
like this I can basically twist it
for its own eggs they basically will
tuck in and stay itself the other side
and I can kind of lift it over my
existing bun so that is how I achieve a
nice little ballerina bun it literally
takes about a minute to do that and you
can buy these packs of hair for $1.99 I
really like the way that it kind of
looks a little keytar and I'm not
wearing earrings I know someone's going
to mention it I like the only one facing
it's without earrings people and that's
so easy to do and it's really secure
like it really doesn't feel like it's
going to go anywhere at all
I feel really bored now oh who is that
that peaceful but yet next I'm going to
show you how I put on the kinky one
again it doesn't blend perfectly
obviously because my hair is a bit
straighter but for those of you who have
a bit more texture in your hair and yeah
it's going to work really well again I
basically separate it into two and I
wrap some hair around the middle but
this time I'm actually going to pin it
at the front oh I love this as a look
you've won my queen to be coming to
America let me know if you know about
that do you guys know about that coming
to America Queen right yeah actually I'm
not I'm gonna pin this at the back just
like this just like I did the other time
and then I'm going to bring it forward
I'm going to twist it in front like that
now in an ideal world I'd probably pin
it again just there maybe that's out so
what I'm going to do is on one of the
sections I'm going to just twist it
lightly at the end because it's very
thick and by the twisting it gives it
more of a doughnut shape and this side
here I'm also going to twist lightly so
that the tighter I twisted the smaller
the bun
and there I have a super-large kinky bun
which is nice just for a little change
of look and for those of you who might
have textured hair again it's 399 for
the bun you can reuse it over and over
again and you know if you get any crazy
like loose bits on the side just get
some gel get a slip brush and you're
good to go so that is it guys I hope you
like this tutorial I'm hoping to do more
hair hair tutorial so if there any
hairstyles you might want me to do then
let me know but if you're not following
me on my Instagram and on Facebook and
on Twitter make sure you follow me and
I'll see you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
