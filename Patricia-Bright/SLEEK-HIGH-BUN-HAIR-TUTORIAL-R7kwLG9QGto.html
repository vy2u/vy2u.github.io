how I upgrade my top bun you guys are
see me wearing this top one quite
regularly recently I may want to know
how do I actually achieve this with my
short hair but I'll show you how in this
tutorial so I use a donut sponge which I
purchased from Primark this is about 99
P but if you don't have one of these
there's ways to easily make one at home
using my husband sock because I'm not
going to use my own and I roll it down
my speed to kind of create that donut
shape and I snip off the end to create
an alternative down
so as you can see I end up with
something very similar to the sponge
that I bought but for what I'm going to
go ahead and do next I'm going to use
the sponge so to create that really fun
look I use hair extensions because I
have short hair if your hair is long
then this is definitely a step you don't
need but the main technique is to fold
and roll once I've done that I basically
pull it through the donut barn or the
sock and put my finger through and
spread out the hair like the star you
can kind of see what that looks like a
top donut bun you can see my hair is
quite fine and quite short so really I'm
not going to get that really thick
bundle so this is what I do so I just
use a fine-tooth comb to basically comb
my hair right up through to the top of
my head I do have some product in it and
I use maybe a styling wax or just upon
me to kind of get my hair nice and shiny
and to listen to me
and in forward a lot when I'm doing this
because the aim is to get the bun as
high as you can and go ahead for some
reason it's never high enough for me
using a scrunchie I just basically tie
my hair up to the top of my head and you
can kind of see that a little bit like a
pineapple here so this is the tricky bit
if you're using hair extensions if
you're not you just slide the donut onto
your ponytail but if you are using hair
extensions you need to get two fingers
through so you can basically pull your
own hair through and the dome so I'm
looking fairly strange here but I've got
it as I want and what I do is basically
push down and pull my hair through a
comb round to shore none of the sponge
or the sock is on the show
so technique I'm using here I call it
the roll and tough so basically now I
get the hair that's come through the
DOMA roll it all the way through and
tuck it underneath to get that really
tight dome on look this is quite a fill
one usually I might using it or less
hair extensions you can see I've got
that kind of dough not not so any bits
that are loose or hanging out I can
easily use hair pins to kind of cut them
all in and get the perfect shape that I
want I just gently smooth around my baby
hairs and that's my top bun completing
so voila I am done I hope that tutorial
was easy and simple to follow thanks for
watching and I can subscribe for more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
