clearly I'm not at home apologies for
the noise I'm in sunny Bay that's right
but now and I've been talking about this
for quite a while but I finally made it
on holiday and I used to always film
when I was on holiday but I kind of
stopped and the thing about when you go
away is that it just gives you just this
it's like a wait list from your
shoulders I don't know maybe because I
work a lot when I'm at home but when I
go away like I get really creative I get
really excited I put on my makeup and I
put on my nice dresses and wear color
and stuff and I feel really good and
like when I feel really good I really
feel like filming and I feel like I
haven't really had a proper chat with
you guys but ages might really just
Express the matzoh off so I just wanted
to do that today I hope you guys don't
mind obviously it's not gonna be perfect
because there's clouds it might come in
and add but I just felt like coming here
and having a chat and just you know
sharing where I'm at all my workers I've
got I asked people my snapchat and I
only did it like half an hour ago so I
don't quite know how much I'm gonna get
on there and on my Instagram as well but
actually there's like 200 questions and
in the meantime what else did I want to
talk about my channel and stuff like I'm
really interested to see where you guys
want me to go next what kind of videos I
would like to see from me so I'm quickly
going to just answer some housekeeping
questions that'll run my makeup look and
I put all the details in my description
bar below my eyelash you've got
individual false eyelashes I do them in
a place called cotton it's called super
much boutique I have to shout them out
because it's amazing and whenever I go
away I always get like falsies like this
one because I hate having to glue on my
eyelashes and they start like peeling
off and I do like to wear makeup when
I'm away so when I see about how I
maintain my makeup when away when I'm
away girl you know it's hard out of here
it is hard out here I really do struggle
to maintain it and it might sweat off
and I just dab it again but there is no
way to have to beat the Sun and even
right now right makeups a little bit
patchy because I don't think I bought
the right foundation with me but
anyway let's see what yarn sense of me
here at about now okay and I do find
that there's lots of questions that I
have answered in the past so if I don't
answer them in the past I'm just going
to skip over them so what's my ultimate
go-to beauty product oh I mean I always
talk like Estee Lauder Double Wear I
love the foundations but I'm looking at
trying new foundations and I'm going to
do a new updated foundation and contour
routine right about now it would be any
kind of lip product I always say that
I'm loving this la splash that I've been
wearing I'm gonna have a makeup tutorial
that shares like my most current
favorite look but our I mean my go-to
makeup product will be a moisturizer
okay let me be honest with you right
because you can't just have foundation
because your eyebrows would be
disappearing you have no eyelashes and
lips to look dry I can't just have Nick
product because it just won't blend and
look quite right so there's no one thing
so I'd say moisturize okay because
nobody likes an ashy face how many kids
do I plan on having I have no idea like
I'm having one right now let me just
deal with that as it currently stands
but I would love to have to a Victoria
Beckham perhaps for when I think about
if I had this discussion with Mike this
morning cuz Mike's a big Beckham fan and
I was like the toys got four kids and
this woman is serious but I think mine
would be between two and three how do I
feel about becoming a mother and I'm
gonna be completely transparent and
honest with you I was not ready for this
this was not a planned pregnancy and I
was a bit like my initial response was
like oh my gosh like this wasn't in my
schedule and if anybody who knows what
I'm like I'm quite I'm a bit of a
control freak and I like things to work
a certain way and my Diaries and my
plans and my goals and then this came in
and then I feel like it was meant to
happen because you can't plan everything
and I'm someone I always tried to plan
my whole life so much and you know I
feel like God was like you know what I
just wrote I'm a just for a baby into
the mix right about now and
so it's taking a while for me to warm up
to it but and I'm gonna be honest with
you I don't feel like I'm the most of
maternal like googly eyed mother in the
world and I can't want to be fantabulous
and my glamorous which is why some of
you guys have noticed that I my looks
have changed since I got pregnant
obviously you have the glow and stuff
like that but like I've been making more
effort because I don't want to I don't
want to let it slip and that might sound
strong to some people but that's my
genuine feeling and I know at the end of
day when you have a baby love will fill
you what am i what are some of my
favorite books
I love the 4-hour workweek by Tim
Ferriss I love feel the fear and do it
anyway
by Susan Jeffers I like the seven Habits
of Highly Effective People so I'm a kind
of person I really like self-help books
a person individual books what do you
think about when you're feeling down
that instantly lifts you up I think
about the grace of God I know I think
about the fact that I am Alive I am
fully blessed I am I have a family who
literally love me I have people around
me who love me and support me I have
grace I have knowledge I have wisdom I
have my right mind and sometimes it's
hard to feel good if you wallow in the
things that you don't have but I think
it's really important to really reflect
on the things that you do have because
these things will empower you because
when you realize that not everybody has
what you have obviously we all have
those down days I have been but I think
gratitude is a great way to get out of
your down moments my biggest fear about
becoming a parent I'm not I'm not
worried man and I think one of the
things that I want for my child and I
always say this I feel that we're living
in a world where people have lost love
where they've lost openness
and I always pray and I always walk for
my child to be someone who's filled of
love and compassion because I think
that's going to be a skill set that a
lot of people in the future won't have
but I don't have fears I have excitement
I do worry about getting fatter I'm
moving to lie to you like if I'd be a
hundred percent we're doing at home too
right now so what's the piece of advice
that you're going to instill in your
newborn child's life love others and
love yourself be compassionate and don't
allow the the ways of this world to
remove that from you because I feel like
I'm I maybe I sound like just some widow
I do feel like love and compassion is
like a really really important thing in
the world we live in today what's the
most important thing in marriage
communication communication and I think
this is something that in my
relationship me and Michael have really
learned a lot recently if you can talk
from this fruit and respectfully just
get it out what's on your chest
get it out don't do this don't worry
about it
don't do this holding it in I talk about
it because like this if you talk about
something you can you can you can deal
with it but if you never talk about
something how you meant to deal with
what's affecting you and at least when
you lay your cards out on the table and
I have always been this kind of person
like I wear my heart on my sleeve
I lay my cards all out and it's
important to do that but also in a way
that isn't harmful or hurtful to another
person how'd you let go of someone and
be able to focus on yourself and for all
my girls from having breakups and on
Valentine's is coming and I would say it
takes time don't just think that all of
a sudden you're over that guy some girls
are lucky like that some of those are
not but realize that time is a really
strong healer and also focusing on what
you want for your future and visualizing
potentially things that wouldn't be
right
usually when people break up there's
that there's a real
remember that reason and don't let them
it felt so good get in the way however I
found pregnancies so far I mean this is
such a big question there's so many
things that happen in pregnancy from the
early stages I was really unwell
I was very nauseating and but that was
like the busiest time for me it was
during that Fashion Week and I was doing
those of work
I felt very sick I felt very tired and
that was one of my first signs is that I
just kept sleeping over why am i
sleeping all the time and I didn't know
I was pregnant obviously and then then I
went through this stage of feeling great
and feeling alright now I feel really
good yeah right now I feel really great
really good sadly I have got pelvic pain
which happens to a lot of women is
basically you release something can
relax in which make sure your ligaments
are looser so if I walk a lot I get
really bad hip pains and like I just
have a lot of aching rather than that I
feel good
emotionally I feel a lot better now
earlier one I was literally a wreck
literally a wreck and I think that's why
I kind of closed up initially some of
the mainly just feeling like closing up
and kind of like protecting myself I
think it was hormonal but I feel good
now
it's my favorite country that I had
traveled to it's gonna be I love
Southeast Asia personally I am an
African woman who likes Asia I spent a
lot of time a lots of different places
from Malaysia to Bali to Singapore to
Thailand Thailand I had a great
experience there with my husbands but I
love the food I won't mind I love the
food and it's visually beautiful like
literally beautiful and also you can get
around very easily what did you notice
in pregnancy that no one talks about you
need to use the toilet a lot and you
might accidentally weigh yourself once
in a while or I am often running to the
toilet for a week and when I need to go
and
to go it's not even a joke whether any
racial issues when you make were dating
so that's what now that you're married
know that there were realistically we're
both from quite modern cities both of
our families are relatively chill and
we're two human beings who share very
similar upbringing if that makes any
sense so what has been my biggest
achievement I mean going it alone and
doing what I can do plus a lot of the
other things that I do behind the scenes
really are big achievement for me
because I feel like I could have gone
one way and didn't go down that way I
hate to be one of those cryptic people
but not like not everything has come to
me really easily if that makes any sense
there are a lot of challenges and things
that I've had to face in my life a lot
of barriers a lot of nose a lot of
reasons where certain things should not
work for me
they have so just overcoming those
challenges and doing what I currently do
and they really are big achievements for
me what my free top tips for someone who
wants to start a YouTube that's blogging
career definitely and be genuine be
honest do what you really like and what
you think you can continue to sustain in
the long term you don't have to follow a
trend actually I think right now people
are looking for people who are a little
bit more freshly little bit more new a
little bit more different and also find
out or grab map competitions I talked
about the rimmel competition right these
competitions really do help and set
people apart and also network with other
youtubers and that kind of thing what is
the one piece of advice that I would
give my young viewers and I feel like
I've still got a lot of younger viewers
although I feel like my views getting
older I'd love to know how old you guys
are my advice to you guys out there is
to be
self don't be distracted or fooled but
what you're seeing here and what you're
seeing that stay focus as they true to
who you are maybe by your own code of
conduct or by your own standards that
might make you seem a little bit weird
but it's okay because being different is
gonna set you apart in the long run and
when I reflect on myself sometimes I
realize that I'm not the coolest person
I've never been cool there's never
really popular but people liked me and I
was always a little bit of a go against
the tide kind of person anyway and that
when you're older you feel actually more
proud of yourself you didn't have to
follow everybody down the route that
they went that half of them where are
you now where are you now so you know if
you have to be that person who goes
against the grain then people look at
you like you're win it's okay trust me
for now really is only indifference but
I like this question how do you stay
organized and manage your time I love
this kind of question okay my face lit
up right I think I want to do a series I
want to talk about all proper adult
things really soon I just need to get my
act together but what about him I'm
thinking about it but I live for my
diary my calendar my notepad my Excel
spreadsheet if you don't know get to
know I love itself
I love software that helps me organize
my invoices and all that kind of good
stuff so I really do like using tools
and applications are a little bit more
technical to help me manage and organize
my life and I think the key thing though
is making a choice and doing it don't
say you're gonna do something and then
let it slip and let it slip you can let
everything slip all the time and then
you're just a mess and also I try not to
set too many tasks on myself to do so
I'll try and maybe set three key things
that I want to achieve in the day and
then after that whatever else I've got
to do I'll do it but I always the night
before as well write down a list of
things to do but I've got much better
tips for like organization if I'd be
honest with you so how do they find it
leaving work and becoming
full-time youtuber it was definitely a
transition for me if some of you guys
don't know my career actually interns so
and I can I can talk about where I
worked now so I worked at Merrill Lynch
I worked in within Investment Banking I
worked in prime brokerage technology and
I was an analyst there business analyst
and then I was made redundant I talked
about on YouTube and then I moved to
Deloitte Consulting and I'm gonna tell
you that Deloitte Consulting was not a
joke that was the hardest job in the
world right but also the job was hard
but I loved the most
that I ever learned and I worked there
for about a year and a half I learned
the most that I ever learned and then
after that I worked at another company
which is a private company where I
worked I worked part time and actually
they have worked within whole YouTube
business and I just wanted to I didn't
want to jump out of not working to
blogging and then after I realized okay
I can bandit to my time and I need a bit
more flexibility I was able to leave so
it was a transition and I've got four
years for five years work experience
under my belt so I feel like I feel
quite confident I've got something to
fall back on a lot of people are asking
about my vlog channel and why I'm not
really vlogging I'm actually planning on
a vlogging maybe what buys bimonthly on
this channel and I realized that for me
personally I got to a place that I don't
want people to just like me because they
like my relationship and I I don't
actually care that much about Fame like
I don't actually want to be famous I
don't want to be popular
I remembered the reason why I shared was
because I like to travelling and I like
to recording my journey and then I've
realized that sometimes it became a
little bit
then vlogging for the sake of it and if
I have to do stuff if I start thinking
I'm living my life to get hits and the
usual to entertain people it wasn't
gonna work for me and I feel like I will
vlog like randomly if I feel like it but
I think me and Michael came to that
decision that it kind of come walk your
mind Jenna I really do think that
vlogging your life regular Neil fill me
online same with the Kardashians people
who put their life out there all the
time it can kind of remove authenticity
from your actual moments and I saw that
happening and personally and it like
that but I don't mind sharing my
personal journey but I think for my
relationship and my home my family that
I just felt like it wasn't for me it
took away from too many moments that
I've really enjoyed what features of
yours would you like to your child to
have I like this question I was gonna
say like my nose I quite like my nose
it's yeah my nose I like my face shape I
think I've got a really nice face shape
then I've got nice cheeks
it sounds like I'm really like feeling
myself but yeah tips on revision and
getting good grades definitely speak to
your teachers do as many test papers as
you possibly can if you have any
questions arts people make sure you get
the right answers Google is also your
friend but there's nothing like saying
to a teacher can i pencil in half an
hour of you and just have your questions
already set up but it's been a long time
since I've done it so yeah what's the
one thing I think should be left in 2015
and that energy bad bad energy and I'm
again I feel like I wouldn't be really
honest I was burn quite a lot last year
by people that makes any sense
and it caused me to close up it made me
think you know what but all of you
however I really wanted to remove that
energy from me this year because I was
that at the end of the day the one thing
that I used to like about myself
that I'm very I say this I wear my heart
on my sleeve
I think everyone's my friend and I think
all that perks is amazing I think
everyone's amazing until they're not
amazing and then I started to say like
whom I'm not sure I'm not sure but I
want to go back to thinking people are
amazing cuz eventuate them but the
reality is that everybody is in their
own way so don't be closed up towards
people leave that negative energy behind
and what will be will be any tips of
becoming more popular as a blogger I
feel like I kind of answered this but
consistency there was some bloggers out
there who are absolutely amazing Lydia
Ellis milind she's the UK blogger she's
amazing because she she really is
consistent she's not the biggest
youtuber or anything but I could see her
becoming huge because she's so amazing
Victoria is amazing consistent and
discipline the girl could Cyndi she is
beautiful and consistent as well like
and I feel like the more you upload
stuff that you like and that people like
me or passionate about people are gonna
see you more and more I'm gonna put some
channels or vloggers and bloggers that I
really like down below do check them out
do send them some love because they're
excellent as well Jake Pierce
I love that girl she's beautiful and I
know she's gonna do really well what's
my advice that I give teen girls who are
not that confident and who are
struggling we've all been there
and you can fake confidence and
confidence comes at a time and
experience and when you're comfortable
yourself I don't think now our teenagers
outlook there might be some who might
appear to be confident but they are and
also it's okay to not be so confident
because in your weakness you find
strength and I'm gonna do a video on
this at some point in time so don't
worry about it you will grow in
confidence but don't let the words of
others bring you down and I always say
this don't and our enemies of progress
to come and speak into your life even
when people say negative things
you'd be like pause pause right there
please
I get this question a lot is can you
breastfeed with implants
it depends can you breastfeed about
implants there's some women who don't
have implants and they couldn't
breastfeed lots of women can breastfeed
with implants some women can't there are
lots of women without implants who can't
breastfeed and my friends I have about
three or four friends who we're not able
to breastfeed I made them some latching
issues maybe there's time and there's
painful for them so breast implants
shouldn't affect breastfeeding there's
no link and my improv are under the
muscle so they have there's no
connection between my milk ducts and my
nipples to my implant they're not near
them pop that part of the boob so I
should be able to how do you support
yourself when everybody's giving up on
you I always say that people will always
fail you relying on other people and
what they do for you to be your
benchmark for happiness and success is
always gonna fall short because people
will always fail you at some point in
time it is human nature you have found
somebody and somebody will throw you
that's okay though learning to encourage
yourself and I did this video come and
when I did the video I think I've been
saying in the video I got carried away I
think that learning to encourage
yourself be happy yourself and know that
your happiness will only come from you
your happiness can't come from someone
else it has to come from internally and
then that really sets you up to ensure
that even if people aren't necessarily
there you're not gonna get so low that
you can't keep it moving but what's the
best and worst snow you can currently
think of I was going to say like maybe
baking where I'll be honest it's like
rice and chicken and stewed being cooked
in my house like go to my mom's house
and then that grub is up that's a good
smell but obviously I wouldn't want to
smell like that physically but I like
that smell but physically I love a sweet
smell
listen out more smells I love George
Armani see that's a beautiful smell
and the worst smell is sewage - sewage
is disgusting
what camera and lighting equipment do I
use to film my videos I use a Canon 6d
which is very similar to a 5d it's a
full-frame camera not sure what lens I
have I will link it in the description
bar below
I have rubbish lighting right now I'm
trying to buy some new lighting but I
usually actually use natural light and
just umbrella light and I've got a road
mic as well so it's nothing fancy but I
want it to get a little fantasy I won't
even mind Nigerian John off of organi
and gel off and I have to say
Nigerian gel off it tastes real nice if
you don't know what jollof is it's
basically a rice dish that West Africans
fight over and say that they're the ones
who invented it how many languages do I
speak I sadly only speak one language
which is English barely but I currently
watching on Netflix at the moment so I
was watching last Kingdom and I
mentioned it being a favourite of mine
and then well someone said if you like
love Kingdom watch reign reign is 3
series and it's 20 I think it's 20
episodes the series it's not more I
ended up watching the whole thing
because of someone's recommendation and
they've been joking and it's not the
first series was not that good but if
actually you start to like the
characters I really liked it and the
costume was amazing in rain I really do
like it so I watched all of that that's
company while I'm watching what would
you do if you could go back in time and
change anything
I would I would have stopped the slave
trade I would have stopped this shake
slave trade
I would have stopped slavery in general
I would have stuck stops there Nazis if
I could have I when I reflect back on
the fact that and I get
really annoyed by this but if you think
that we there was a time where people
thought that people would delude
themselves that believe another set of
people are not assertive people because
of a difference in religion or skin tone
I think you know what that means I'm
gonna do I'm gonna snatch them from
their land but I'm gonna make them work
for me I'm gonna take them I'm going to
kill them I'm gonna break them for 300
years plus like oh wait oh wait is it
mad is this madness like when I think
about I think you the people who did it
must have been literally insane but
these are people who ruled our
governments you could like it blows my
mind what's the physical personal trait
I think I would like my tarty inherit
from my husband and for a daughter
none really I mean I don't know if
Michaels gonna make a good looking girl
for my son I think my husband has an
amazing facial structure and you know he
is my husband but I might babe we got a
model bone structure so I'd love for my
my son tab its face structure because I
think Michaels got quite a regal face
drew facial structure it's like he kind
of looks like a prince like an English
Prince I don't know you luck might not
agree but when I look at him that's what
he reminds me of it's like you've got a
crate you know strong strong jaw babe
what's my favorite clothing piece at the
moment anything that is long and loose
and shows a little bit of cleavage like
this dress right now my boobs are
looking great and I'm enjoying them and
but the rest is looking a little bit hmm
I've been very really struggled with the
body changes that happen with pregnancy
if I've been really
and it's because I don't look that big
obviously now I look definitely more
pregnant but there's a time when it just
look like I just look really bloated and
I feel that it's nice to look pregnant
like really pregnant or like not
pregnant
well I was just like side Irish but yeah
would you rather be without elbows or
knees I'd rather be without knees I feel
like hands are beautiful you can hold
you can touch someone you can pick
things up like if I didn't have knees
then that can have a wheelchair and I
can still get around and I can be lifted
and carried but then if I if I didn't
have hands I couldn't carry anyone very
much sure of that yes I do have baby
names picked out and I've always known
the name that I wanted to name my
daughter which I think people do know I
love classic names I'm not that creative
I like things that have meaning and
grace is the name that I'm going to go
in I think we think greater than name
I'm going to go in for my daughter's
name because I think it's a beautiful
name that come it it makes me think of
the grace of the Lord it makes me think
of her being gracious I think it's just
a reminder of where we have all come
from we've all come from a place where
potentially grace has been what saved us
last question is are you happy because
I've got so many questions here I'm
going to just end it because this video
is going to be super long my answer to
that is I am happy happiness is
something that you have to work on break
in the knee and you know
again what's the definition of happy is
it feeling elated and smiley all the
time or is it a feeling of contentment
and I feel like right now I'm as content
if I could possibly be and filled with
just I don't know I feel like a freedom
and it makes me feel really happy
I've actually been shooting this video
for an hour so I'm not quite sure how
long it's gonna go on for but I want to
go get some food right about now okay
and I've got some local friends who
actually gonna take me around so that
sounds really nice this still looks like
hundreds of questions I still go to
answer I'm sorry
maybe next time like a but lots of them
are repeats and stuff so yeah and it
