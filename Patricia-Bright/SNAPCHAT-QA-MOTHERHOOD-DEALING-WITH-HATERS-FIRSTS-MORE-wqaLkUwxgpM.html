I'm finally going to do a snapchat Q&amp;amp;A
and I've been meaning to do it for like
a month or so but I just haven't had the
chance to do it but today I'm actually
taking the time to sit down and find the
answer the questions that you guys sent
me and if I sound a bit funny I've got a
wire in my mouth now and I'll talk about
my Invisalign treatment but there's that
now a wire in the back of my mouth and I
feel like I talk really strange now but
it just takes a little bit of getting
used to anyway
as it's gonna be a long one I'll just
warn you now because there's a lot of
questions get comfortable get a cup of
tea put this on pause save it for the
morning when you're doing your makeup
and yeah I'm not gonna rush it for room
I'm gonna get into this one you know
it's been a while it's been a really
long while and you guys know I love
talking and please believe I don't have
a gorgeous phone case or anything fancy
like that my phone case actually looks
like a potato but yeah we're just gonna
act like this isn't what really is
happening can I get any advice on
starting equipment for YouTube channel
and affordable camera and good editing
software thanks in advance a lot from
the states my advice for starting
equipment for YouTube is I definitely
love Canon I find that people are
usually ever a Nikon person or a Canon
person and I'm a Canon person but
they're both as good as each other and I
think you should start out with a flip
screen the camera I would recommend is
the 60d which flips out but it doesn't
have autofocus so actually if you can
get one that autofocus is then I would
definitely go with that but when I
started out on YouTube if you ever see
the grainy Samsung handheld camera thing
I had that used to stack on shoeboxes
and books to use then you understand
that but you don't necessarily need a
really high quality crazy camera but
just something that has a clear picture
so creative Jenna has said how do you
stay so happy and confident well thank
you Janet and I'm obviously happy and
confident when I'm sitting in front of a
camera when I've had a cup of tea and
I'm in a room all by myself and of
course I come across as happy and
confident
and to be honest I think that we all
have moments where we're definitely
unhappy which I've chose to the ad and
I'm emotional and totally times are
uncomfortable but what keeps me happy is
just staying really grounded my family
and my friends are like the most
important thing to me in the entire
world and speaking to friends and family
really makes them happy and remembering
that that's really really important that
you know keeps me in a really good
positive place and realizing that
everything else actually doesn't matter
that much and then in terms of
confidence I kind of tried to just roll
with whatever comes my way and I kind of
T take deep breath and just do it even
if I feel uncomfortable so I always talk
about feel the fear and do it anyway
but it's that principle of just you know
even if it feels oh just do it because
that is what will give you more strength
and more confidence in the future
rayma has asked me how would you kick
lazy habits and become more disciplined
I'm 23 and still struggling to kick
habits such as leaving everything to the
last minute well girl I'm not gonna lie
to you I leave things to the last minute
all the time
I'm not gonna lie to you I'm definitely
one of those people I love working under
pressure but when it comes to laziness I
mean I think that you're lazy when we
don't really care about something or
where you can't see the vision of where
that thing's going to go to in the
future so for me whenever I do something
it's remembering the reason as to why I
do it so be it that you're studying for
exams or you've got an essay to do or
something like that which I know so many
of you guys have it's a case of
realizing that you need to put the
effort in now so that you're preparing
for your future or you need to you know
do that exercise now so that you look
tight on the beach you know later that's
what I'm telling myself at the moment so
realizing the reason and giving it value
is really important Russ lady has said
to me when did it when and how did my
turn he loves you or did you tell him
first he told me first but it was
definitely over the phone and we were
long-distance for two years and I had
to London and I think that's just before
an internship or something I can't
actually remember actually but it was I
was in London and he was in Manchester
we used her for our phone calls all the
time you know pretext there was no text
in our age and I'm lying there was text
but we were definitely phone call people
and went talk for hours on the phone I
miss those days
and I'm sure over the phone you kind of
mumbled but I love you and I was like
and they say finally and it's such a
burden on your shoulder when you're
telling someone you love them or whether
or not it's you know just there or if
it's just you it's but it Quincy isn't
it but he tells me he loves me every day
so enjoy a car I had asked me about
Grace's other names and if she does have
them and she does she's at t got my mom
and Mike's mom's name and she does have
a tradition in name which is my favorite
tradition name which is Chitti MA but I
mean TT is like the shortened version of
her name which is like a favorite of
mine was my best school memory my best
school mummy I mean I'm gonna be honest
with you I didn't really like school
itself
I enjoyed education though my property
like that like I liked education but
school it so much memory I mean this is
kind of a good and bad memory so I was
bullied a little bit by the guy and I
say bullied I mean people wanted to beat
me up and I was never very I was never a
very good victim because I was really
mouthy and really confident in terms of
like you can't tell anything to me and
probably that's why the guys in the year
but that you cannot bear me they always
find someone to pick on and I was like
that's literally a twig I was a twig
we've got the big peanut head anywho
that's another story for another day and
I remember that like there was one girl
who adamantly wanted to beat me up and
she was just like so annoying something
like so whatever and then I'm the last
day of school I thought I always
pretended like I didn't care I wasn't
scared I was as they say shook I was
scared to get scared and I knew that
like this girl was gonna wait for me
after school was gonna beat me up
and there were a couple of girls and
- my sisters Fatima and all those girls
and one of the girls and we was put the
little Asian crew I call it and one of
the girls gave me her hijab to basically
wear and I was like I'm invincible
why do I always like everything is so
glittery and she gave me her hijab and
like because they were a big group so I
walked up with all of the girls like hey
look at me a job' that you would never
ever know that I was like mingling into
the group and then the girl wasn't able
to pick me up and I just remember that
being such a good moment because I
remember how how the girls are there for
me and and Alice afloat I saw I was part
of so many different groups and that
group was one of the groups I've got
lunch time I might chill with those
girls and I remember just feeling like
so warm and welcomed and that this got
actually took up out the job like for me
and I was thinking I hope your dad don't
see you firm up but I'm sure you would
have understood so yeah that was it
princess nas 100 I said who's your
favorite celeb I am not really a celeb
hunter II kind of person but I'm not
gonna lie I'm a big Beyonce fan and I'll
be honest with you I never liked Beyonce
and I don't want the Beehive to kill me
right now don't kill me no my feelings
down no but I actually couldn't bear
like before I really couldn't bear like
but now I just see this woman I just
think you're actually a G like
everything she does is excellent and I
love excellence she does everything
excellently she must work so hard she's
gorgeous she's great mother wife all
that kind of good stuff and I think you
know what you are actually seriously
really great like you seriously I can't
be a hate anymore you're
and then I also love Leonardo DiCaprio
is my favorite actor like I know he's
turning into a granddad with the beer
belly but I still have such a soft spot
in my heart for him from the beach and
my man Cheney yeah and Titanic like he's
just he's just lovely
Jody Kasem has asked me do I think I
will be a strict mum or lenient mum I
always thought I was gonna be a really
strict mom like open it to be like quite
a mean strict mum I don't know why I
thought that but then now I'm matching
in mother I just feel like I'm a
glittery a big kid and I don't know how
to actually be straight alright I laugh
and I mess around my baby and i annoy
her and you know take her and do all the
things that you're not really meant to
do I do that - like mice I'd do it to
her to like just bother her and I think
it's funny so I think I'm gonna be more
of an idiot mom I'm gonna be one of
those moms who wants to be really cool
okay and the funny thing is that like my
mum was just the uncoolest moment ever
used to be so embarrassed of my mom but
now my mom's like literally that's it
like the same as me she like a big kid
and she annoys me all the time but in a
really fun way so let's see how that
goes how'd you get over haters right so
I don't know if I've said this before I
hate the term haters I don't believe in
haters do you know what not everyone is
going to like you and that's okay not
you're not meant to be always like Jesus
was a man who half the people hated him
okay Dalai Lama there's so many people
who hated there's so many amazing people
who people don't like and it is
absolutely okay
and I don't focus my energy on how
somebody else feels about me I focus my
energy on how I feel about me it's okay
just live your life and don't be
bothered by it
Senya has asked me hey Patricia did you
get Invisalign and how have the results
been so far I'm halfway through mine yes
I did get Invisalign I had a wonky teeth
here it's still a touch wonky but it
used to kind of disappear off into his
own world and I got Invisalign last year
it wasn't actually Invisalign it was
clear braces so for those of you who
can't
get Invisalign just tell your dentist
clear braces because Invisalign is a
brand and yeah I had those in and what
has happened yeah it was a year and it
hurt because you just had to keep
wearing these different braces to kind
of bring your teeth in but I really do
like the results and I'm not going to
lie my teeth do I look a lot better but
it's not permanent if you stop wearing
the brace the plastic brace your your
teeth naturally want to move back to
where they were like the teeth want to
go back to look over there so I have a
wire put in the back of the front for
two and then actually feels really weird
and I actually only did it in last week
so I'm trying to get used to it and
stuff not your destiny I said to me
how'd they do snapped back so fast after
grace my mother wouldn't let me out in
the house for six weeks and I still and
after five months I still don't look as
fabulous as you well thank you darling
but I'm telling you that though that uh
smoke and mirrors being the fact that I
am definitely wearing a control pant and
support there and I actually haven't
snapped back in tiny I mean at an eight
pound baby
I was really small and I got stretched
out a lot so and I never had abs
beforehand anyway so my muscles have
gotten a lot looser but when I wear a
corset and everything it sucks me and it
keeps it all nice and tight but I still
have a lot of stretching but I'm just
being patient with it initially I wanted
to like rush into it and I just like
whatever and eventually it just gets
smaller and smaller I just have that
little mum pouch at the moment
Noorie princess I said would you
consider doing reviews of high-end
products I liked at Easter and it's a
complete death of Black Beauty reviews
of high-end cosmetics of a non sports of
nature I think that's an excellent
question number one because I think
tatty is amazing she is flawless and
just excellent in her delivery and gives
really good reviews
I think she's just amazing i link her
channel below do check her out if you're
someone who's really into their like
beauty and hire and beauty and I'm not
gonna lie I love high-end beauty I might
not middle range beauty's well drugstore
you I love all of it but I do find that
sometimes subscribers get a bit upset
when you do use more expensive products
so I'd like to know if you guys you know
don't mind that kind of stuff because I
used a higher-end products a lot at the
time and I kind of use them in my
tutorials but I think I'll do some
minutes a bit of more review based I
think I'm gonna do like face that is all
one makeup brand and keep doing that but
we'll see how it goes
Tammy pond has asked me how and why did
you start off your hair business you're
such an inspiration I'd love to be like
you once I'm done with uni well thank
you so much Tammy that is so nice it
touches my heart and how and I would say
the way if you guys have watched me long
enough new latina that is started
YouTube all about hair like YouTube hair
was the reason I came onto YouTube I
used to be part of a forum and the long
hair careful of which was dis forum of
women who has growth who were growing
their hair really really long styling it
just doing such amazing things
I was the playground hair stylist I used
to braid up girls hair at lunch time in
when I was 13 and I used to make money
that way
at university I quit my job and I was
doing a hair at home and that's right
Harley funded myself while I was at uni
and I always have money because I always
had an on ongoing client list so here
was something that I've actually loved
from the very beginning like Niki
beginning of I think I was born to like
do hair
that kind of good stuff and I used to
wear tights on my head it's a kid's wish
I got long hair and I don't naturally
have long or thick hair it doesn't grow
like that I'm just being real
and so it's always been in my DNA I feel
to just do something that was related to
hair specifically and I wanted to do it
years ago but I just didn't have the
time I was working I was so busy and
then since going full-time freelance I
then was like right I'm gonna pursue
this and I'm gonna do this and we've had
when I say excellent feedback oh my gosh
it's been amazing
mimmo see banda has asked me do I know
any good primers for very oily skin I'm
coming loving the murad invisiblur which
i think is a really good primer and you
put it on before actually you don't need
to put makeup over it but it gives you a
nice matte finish and it's got an SPF 30
in it and I'm also liking the time
primer from bare minerals as well GDK
Joe has asked me where would I like to
go on my next holiday well if you don't
know I've actually booked for a next
holiday and probably by the time you see
this video I might be on it no I might
just be about to go on it actually and
I'm going to start in Hell which is in
Italy and I go to Italy quite regularly
I mean when I was a kid I used to go all
the time I have family who live out
there and it's one of my favorite places
to go to we're going to Sardinia which
is an island just off the coast because
we want to kind of first family holiday
I mean wanted to keep it in Europe right
now Europe is only an hour to you know
an hour and a half to go to so we're
keeping it simple but I'm sure by next
year we'll go much further afield and
with the little one Hannah dimples
that's me
what is my advice for growing a
successful YouTube channel and well I
mean I have been doing YouTube for a
good six years at this point in time and
I think definite the definition of
success is different for everyone so it
might be loads and loads of teenage
subscribers it might be really dedicated
music fans it might be
really dedicated Beauty enthusiastic out
what your definition of success is but I
think the key thing is transparency so
just being as real as possible and
consistency they always say about
uploading as regularly as you can but
don't be like stuck to the schedule like
if you feel like doing four videos then
do four videos and if you feel like
doing one video just do the one just do
what you you feel like doing but be
consistent with it being unique while
still following some of the trends and
formats that are on YouTube
so you might have asked me what are my
favorite movies and this is a good
question I like questions like this but
I feel like it really makes you realize
Who I am I've got quite a few so City of
God is that one of my favorite it's a
Brazilian mood movie Romeo and Juliet
with Leonardo DiCaprio a favorite of
mine watched it in school and it watched
it ever since all the time over whenever
I'm feeling down I play that movie it
makes me feel really good Leon with
Natalie Portman when she was young oh my
gosh
beautiful beautiful film one of my
favorites again and Apocalypto excellent
film and I'm an x-men fan as well I'm
definitely an excellent fan Naomi xoxoxo
is asked me what was the last concert
you went to I do not go to concert I I
wish I did and I'm I'm embarrassed to
tell you what the last concert I went he
was but I'm gonna tell you I'm gonna
tell you it I'm actually embarrassed is
that key Ludacris and Chingy like it do
Abbott engi how cringe-worthy was that
but actually I had a whale of a time and
I don't really go to concerts but that
happened like at Brixton Academy years
ago but I'm actually going to the
Rihanna concert in London and I am going
hopefully going to the Beyonce concert
is also look at me stepping up my game
they made bit all has asked me how do I
live an organized life girl don't ask me
this question
if you understand how it makes me
excited to think about organization you
guys know this about me I love it
and I write notes all the time
I plan each evening what I'm gonna do
and I'm not gonna lie
I don't always stick to it but it's
literally just getting the into the
habit of writing what's important in
priority I try to think of two to three
key goals I want to achieve in any given
day and I try and I work towards them I
also use a lot of PowerPoint to give me
just focus on my life and stuff and
Excel and I have alarms and all that
kind of stuff on my phone so just taking
the time to be organized or to put
planning in place will help you be
organized so it's true dear that's me
what is my opinion on everyone going
vegan crazy don't get me wrong it's I
can see the positive sides but I like me
some chicken
it hit once in the world so here's my
thoughts on it it's one of those topics
actually feel like you're not able to
speak about anymore which is actually
quite sad it's an almost a bit like when
you have like a dictatorship or
something you can't really speak about
it without gonna be an attack Salman was
gonna say I'm lookin answer that
question I think it's great that people
are becoming more conscientious about
themselves and the environment around
them and everybody taking the small
steps that they can to improve the
situation for themselves and others
around them is excellent and food is to
be enjoyed as well as to nourish and not
everybody has the chance to eat you know
luxuries like we do so it's something we
shouldn't take for granted and just to
be aware of and that's my take on the
whole matter Jeana Keough's asked me who
is my favorite game of Thrones character
I was initially gonna say Johnston
either who I've actually named is John
sex because he's actually so bad like
hello and but it would probably be
tyrion tyrion is like a g like he's
literally a g he's got so much swag and
he's just an excellent character what
would I do if I couldn't be a youtuber I
run businesses so I would be a business
woman which is Who I am
and which is what I do
I would probably invest in different
businesses I used to work in the finance
world so I know a bit here and there
about investing I love it I like it
sounds really bad but I love making
money I love watching money kind of
turnover I like when you put something
in and watch it transform and come out
into something else like that really
excites me so I'd probably keep doing
that and but I also love marketing and
planning and what be a project manager
or something yes
along those lines cuz baby has actually
wasn't it struggled to get on the
property ladder when I did and how long
did it take any hits and hints and tips
I think this is a video for another day
I don't know how many how old you guys
are and where you are financially is
that something you want to know about
how to get on the property ladder as a
young person oh my god I think that's a
video idea I think I'm actually gonna do
that even if it's not watched by those
of people I just think it'd be useful
yes I've gotten the property number at
the age of 24 alongside my husband I did
not do it on alone but he actually
bought his first house at the age of 21
in Manchester so was it difficult no the
key thing about getting on the property
ladder is one having a deposit and that
is basically saving and if you're not
saving then boy you ain't gonna get in
the property like that because you need
to deposit and secondly is having work
experience which is only three months to
be able to get enough money to get a
mortgage and then when you have that you
get an agreement in principle besides
that it's all a quick and easy process
but sometimes it's difficult if the
buyer of the seller isn't ready to sell
you or you're negotiating fees from a
bra and then all the legal and paperwork
that's not the hard stuff but overall
it's not a hard process it's just having
the initial deposit and did I find
saving hard yes of course life is
expensive so yeah that was one of those
things that I had to deal with so far
this is actually what is my take on
motherhood and what has changed
motherhood has been anime
seeing journey for me I mean not that
much has changed other than I have this
extra ball of life to love I am I never
felt like I was like the most maternal
person I'm probably not in terms of you
know being really cuddly and coolly and
that kind of thing
but I'm extremely extremely loving and
extremely what's the word like
protective and sometimes that in the
middle of the night when my baby wakes
up in kind I kind of look at her just
just kind of this like this shock and
I'm short other parents will get it it's
like I actually don't believe like I do
or we created you like how did you come
here you weren't here and now you're
here and you're beautiful but you have
this moment this like every time it kind
of hits you like like what you're here
and that is what I feel motherhood is
it's That moment when you realize you've
created something so beautiful so
innocent so wonderful that you get to
love it's just really powerful and from
a practical perspective I get Leslie
which is fine but I feel like my bodies
are just in my baby sleeps about five
hours at night now I get a less sleep
but I'm working with it and one of the
key things I realized there is no time
to waste
if you guys thought I was efficient
before I don't play a single game now
because that moment that she's down you
need to do something you got to do the
laundry
you got to wash up you got to watch the
bottle if you gotta film a video you're
gonna sort out the clothes do you got
something to do you can't just go AHA
what my doing right now no there's no
time for any of that mate and yeah and I
feel feel like also that being a mother
has made is gonna granted me more and I
spend so much time with my friends and
family now it's not but most weekends I
don't look at anything I just don't look
at social or post my baby or social but
you'll see that there's like other kids
around I have a but I had a barbecue
with like all my family around and I
think she just made me realize or keep
remembering the importance of the loved
ones you have around you and the joy
that it brings
and I thought the happiest I've ever
felt in my life because I think during
my pregnancy I was like I wasn't I
wasn't the happiest but now I'm like no
I'm free happy and I just got this
thinking of here they think not really
think but I've got this baby to love
which is just beautiful she's lovely and
if you want to see how she's on my
snapchat like literally every day I know
I haven't been vlogging but I've just
been busy
Alex posing is actually what's the next
milestone you would like to accomplish
in your life and for me it's definitely
building my businesses further I am what
a businesswoman through and through I
absolutely love business
I love finance and you guys know this
about me anyway and one of the things
that kind of bothered me was that I
always felt like businesses that are
directed that women are always run by
men and I love men don't get arrested I
love men but I also feel it's really
important for women to feel that they
can do something and currently I employ
like four girls and I would like to
implement more girls I mean we're all
for boys and girls working with us but I
like the fact that I'm giving women the
benchmark to feel like they can you know
work and be providers and be strong but
also be soft like it it's important to
still be soft and feminine and beautiful
and loving and supportive but also do
your own thing so for me that's really
important and texture has I've seen what
is my favorite thing to do well if you
know me really well my favorite thing to
do is basically to eat I'm a big fat
eater
I love eating I love food but I also
love just walking and I just walk
everywhere all the time and I find it
very relaxing and therapeutic not just
on an exercise perspective and you guys
should follow me on earth miles actually
it's so funny because it tracks like how
much I walk and stuff like that and I
remember there was a season where I
wasn't walking as much and one of my
friends who follows me on my earth Mars
which just had some activity she's like
I noticed that you did you didn't you
haven't been doing as much walking as
you normally do and I was like damn like
you really own this and I thought
so so good and I just walked to kind of
keep relax to get my mind in focus I
like do laps around my park and I've
come up with so many ideas just when I'm
walking and when I'm at home and I just
like I just feel so like it's everything
it's weighing on my head I'm tired of
the babies in the client let's go out
it's got a little walk but it's how I
come back I feel like a new person I
love it so nice I said to me there's a
lot of pressure these days for girls to
be sexually free as part of believing in
equality and being a feminist but what's
your advice are goes out there you're
wanting to save it whether it's a
religious or cultural or personal
reasons
Thanks see I think this is a really
interesting question
just because obviously I was with my
boyfriend now husband from the age of 19
and I didn't have loads of boyfriends
before that like I could count them on
two fingers basically and here's a
couple of things I say it takes strength
to be soft so for you to be really
feminine really calm it also takes
strength for you to be someone who's got
a lot of integrity and decide you want
to keep yourself that takes a lot of
strength if you decide you're somebody
who wants to be out there and giving it
all that takes a lot of strength
there's no there's never a good or bad
but it's really important for you to be
true to yourself don't do stuff just
because everybody else is doing it
because the only person that you are
going to harm at the end of the day is
yourself but the reality is that giving
your body away constantly without love
without depth I don't think it's a good
thing I actually realized that it's like
selling yourself short right and I know
that some women they get affirmation or
they they often give a lot of themselves
away for because they have that desire
to be accepted but until you accept
yourself throwing yourself out there is
not going to do that if you just want to
have fun I need you to feel good you
know there are things for that wink or
if you want to go out there and you
don't want to do that that is true to
you but I've seen a lot of hurt and
devastation
for girls who have you know given
themselves out a lot and I think just be
careful whatever you do do it safely but
remember you can guide your body but you
can't always guide your heart and I
think that women we are creatures that
our heart is our hearts are easily moved
when we open our legs basically so be
careful who you open your heart and your
next to so guys that is it for me I
answered loads of questions to spend
like the camera actually stopped but I'm
still got loads more questions so I
might save it for another day I might do
like a Q&amp;amp;A and answer it on my snapchat
actually but thank you guys so much for
your questions if you have any extras
put them in the comments below if you're
not following me on my snapchat make
sure you do on my Instagram make sure
you do I'm over there and yeah I will
catch you all later
