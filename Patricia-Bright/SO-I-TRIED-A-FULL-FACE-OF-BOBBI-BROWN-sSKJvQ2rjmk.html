bar that's what I'm talking about hello
beautiful people welcome to my channel I
hope you are doing well today today
we've got this look here we've done it
we've done a full face of Bobby Brown
and yeah as you can see him feeling the
results I want to show you how I got
this look basically trying out some
products from Bobby Brown and Bobby
Brown is realistically one of those
classic brands that you know I feel
personally was always there for me like
when I first started wearing makeup
Bobby Brown was definitely where I would
go to for like foundations and actually
even color products I always went to
them because a lot of brands we know
works back in stock in shades or they
weren't stuck in right shades but but
the guys are Bobby Brown they always had
the good stuff but it's been a while and
haven't seen anyone do a full face of
Bobby Brown so I'm about to do that
today for you actually partnered with
them back in October I went to New York
did this amazing video which you guys
can check out down below in the
description bar below and it kind of
made me like just fall back in love make
you wanted to try some new stuff do a
full face and then show you guys what it
could look like so that's what I'm gonna
do today for you and you guys know I'm
or like I'm not a makeup artist I am
just an everyday girl who wants a look
beautiful and hopefully my steps are
easy enough to follow that you can do as
well okay guys let's get into this video
okay so yeah I am bare face right now
I've been having a little bit of just
dry skin issues it's the winter and I
always get like eczema around my eyes
that you help me they look very very dry
but we're gonna work on that and look
after our skin and I'm gonna go in if
you guys have seen me use this before
this is the vitamin enriched face base
which is like a moisturizing primer and
I love oh hello this is a new fresh one
and I love this primer I think it's
really good I love the way my makeup
literally slips and slides on when I use
this right next I'm going in with some
foundation and I'm going in with the new
foundation this is the skin longer
weightless foundation it's SPF 15 it's
full coverage you know I love
myself some full-coverage foundation I
actually have tried this once when I was
in the u.s. I actually used this on the
shoe and I can't look entirely remember
what it feels like on and I didn't apply
myself so we're just gonna a like this
is the first time I've done this
supposedly it covers pores it gives you
full coverage but it also feels a really
nice and weightless I'm gonna use this
full coverage face brush in all honesty
like I haven't been using a face brush
all so it's really nice it's a really
soft
wow that's a really nice brush that is
really nice I was gonna say I don't
normally use brushes to apply my
foundation and stuff but you know what
I'm gonna go in cuz this feels
phenomenal okay what shade am i wearing
this is a shade called almond yep I
think we can roll it is fragranced okay
not fragrance it's more like it sounds I
don't know if there is or is it feels
like there's some essential oils in it
it's got that kind of smell this is my
area where I basically have my beard so
this is what I like to see can you cover
up my beard I think in coverage I think
they're getting beard coverage okay you
know this feels like the first
foundation that I've applied on here
that doesn't have that orange look that
I usually have you guys know and I often
get people saying well your foundation
looks very orange and then it blends in
but this does not have that orange
effect which I do kind of like sometimes
that orange but this is way more like
natural this makes any sense but the
coverage is full and it's definitely
matte it's like mattifying into my skin
in tensley right now okay Bobbi Brown
okay foundation on I don't know why I
did my foundation before I did my brows
because I know that looks ridiculous I'm
gonna go in with their brow pencil I
have a brow pencil here the shade is
called rich Brown my eyebrows have been
so struggle recently I don't know why
it's filling in my brow but I would have
to put a lot of product on and go quite
hard right I'm going to forfeit my brow
pencil because these are giving me way
too grown up brows and I like Instagram
brows
it's quite light for me it's quite light
coverage I don't have a lot of eyebrow
hair I need more like paint on my brows
okay my brows I've done I put a little
based on my ideas I'm gonna go ahead and
conceal now you guys already know I
always use the instant full-coverage
concealer from Bobbi Brown I'm actually
a huge fan of this and this came out I
think last year so I think this is one
of the main reasons why I was like you
know what I need to start going back in
and seeing what else you know Bobbi
Brown has this concealer
y'all be knowin how much I love this
concealer today I'm gonna use almond
which is the slightly darker shade I
either use almond or golden but I feel
like the foundation the Superman is
slightly darker than I would normally go
for in terms of foundation so I'm just
gonna go a bit darker in general I'm
just gonna use my finger to blend that
in actually I just feel like this makes
me just look so lifted and just light
and lit from within love it
see that it blends in so beautiful so
naturally I love it next I'm gonna go in
and do my eyes and I'm gonna use this
evening glow eyeshadow palette this is I
don't know if it's new or not I don't
think it is but I learned that really
cute and you guys know I'm a sucker for
gold package in how cute does this look
this Brown it's kind of like a level of
thick I mean it's a little bit cold for
me down he looks a bit cold but I'm just
gonna see what it looks like on I
usually like warmer Browns but this is
the only eyeshadow palette I have so I'm
just gonna try and grow with it and then
I've also got these these are the eye
shadow little ones they have these
little you always see them in store how
cute is that those how cute is that
package in okay wow that's actually very
pigmented because it looks quite grey
but actually it's really quite pigmented
I'm gonna go in with this light pinky
shade and see what this looks like this
reminds of the kind of makeup colors I
used to work back in the day but see
with that pink what I feel like I need
in this is like a red or just something
like or burgundy then just kind of gray
but that Pink's such a cute pink this is
a very springtime look right I'm not
feeling that shade but I'm loving the
little ping AHA but I can see there's a
brush this is a brush in berry this is
what you need inside through the
eyeshadow palette I'm just gonna use the
blush the blush look at that how nice is
that I mean maybe it's weird
some people but I love like reds and
burgandy's and those kind of shades and
the pigment payoff on these is
ridiculous
and then I'm gonna go in with this black
plum I'm just gonna be really gentle
because these are super pigmented there
we go I'm feeling that okay so for me
these kind of little individuals are the
way to go because you can pick your
colors and I'm like you know what
they're pigmented they're definitely
pigmented but I'm gonna go in with this
little shimmer and just go in my inner
tear duct oh wow that is a shimmer that
is true so strong Wow okay well okay
then well okay what is this this is a
long wear liquid liner I just did the
smoothest Jettas blackest line ever what
I'd like to see is does it bleed because
some of these liners they bleed but this
isn't bleeding okay let's just do this
that's really good it's a needle thing
it's not individual brushes I feel like
it's as a sponge but it's needle thin
okay did my line ah I think it actually
looks flawless the other issues I made a
fair few mistakes I said just wipe down
and restart again but it's really really
small really really thin and there's a
lot of products so your I thought like
your your your applicator it can get
quite loaded so you need to actually
just you know swipe it a little butt off
so you don't end up looking crazy or
making mistakes like I did but it's jet
black it was really shiny but it's dried
nice and matte let's get some mascara on
okay this is the smokey eye mascara I'm
not new to this
it's not a new product it's a really
good mascara I just haven't been using
it a lot lately so yes let's just go in
there let's see if it's gonna make much
difference to my baby lashes down here I
mean it's a nice it's a nice type of the
scar I feel like it makes my eyelashes
curl quite a bit but I actually feel
like I need mascara that kind of
stretches them I want longer lashes not
curly lashes because they actually KO
upwards quite a bit but it's nice like
my eyelashes are covered they look a
little bit longer they definitely look
fuller but you know I'm still gonna put
my lashes on because I'm
or lashes on feeling good I'm gonna go
in with contour I didn't see a contour
product that I wanted to use so I'm just
gonna go with my normal Mac contour
stick which you guys know that I like
just to contour my nose a little bit
part of me feels like I wanna go in with
a slightly lighter concealer I might
just go in a little bit with the golden
because I'm just not as lit as I would
like to be and I know I like to go quite
light with my concealer and kind of look
a little bit Instagram makeup s well
that's why I like brands like this you
can build it up yeah I'm gonna add a
little golden just to brighten it up a
little bit more amazing right let's go
setting stuff finished pressed
powder nice let's do this no one uses
poof's anymore oh gosh is it a shade off
this is called golden brown golden brown
I love that song wow there's a lot of
color it's real pigmented Wow
oh my gosh I shouldn't have gone
straight in on that that's beautiful I
love the way it looks to finish what I'm
gonna do is baked under my eyes using my
stash just to lighten it up a bit more
for me I'm such a loose powder girl I
feel like there's literally no way to
turn back from being a loose powder girl
I have got to say that the packaging is
super cute I am going to just rub this
off and I'm hoping that it's all blended
and look nice as you can see that
powders it's actually not that but
it is a great finishing powder I feel
like this will instantly come in to my
main collection this brush Wow
this brush is the blush brush
I'm very matte now I'm very very very
matte right now very matte but I like it
right let's add some you know life back
I'm gonna go in with this highlighting
powder and it's called bronze glut just
look at the glow just look at this
there's an angled face brush let's go in
oh it's kind of like opening a bar of
gold your god ah you go I'm very happy
I'm very happy whoa you guys see that
really really nice I think what I feel
like when as I'm
using this is that I can sense the
quality I can sense the history and I
like it and pikmin is coming through I'm
gonna go ahead and I'm gonna use the
blaster which is called barony and I
used on my eyes but yeah we're just
gonna use it on our cheeks look I just
weren't like that look at that but you
have to be careful because sometimes
you'll be looking like a natural clown
got a little hidden pink of my cheeks I
can tell I can build it up if I want to
go to art I can build it up but I
decided I'm not gonna do that
I'm nothing right I'm loving it now
we've got to finish off I feel like I
need a bit of highlight on my nose let's
just go in but I feel like this bronze
glow could actually go ham they have a
lip liner the lip liner is called
chocolate this is giving me bittersweet
fights and I'm not mad
although it says chocolate can you see
it's more like a burgundy burgundy s
crown on me what am I gonna do what am I
gonna do so these are the crushed lip
colors which are basically kind of like
a satin lipstick I believe and then
there's also glosses and this goes here
naked plumber and this is like a
miniature one this shade is called buff
which looks like a nice nudey pink
it's got coverage though because I have
a little bit chapped lips and you know
Bevis or lip or you can't see that oh
this is really sexy that's what I'm
talking about
I wonder if this is limp pumping I think
it's got some menthol or something
inside it cuz it's tingling just a
little bit bit minty fresh
I'm gonna go in with my fixed gloss
spray because it's just one finished
love it's love love love love love those
results really love it love the way my
base looks laughs the way my base looks
yeah yeah full face of Bobbi Brown full
face of God Bobby Brown the products
came together nicely
obviously there are products that I have
used before here but I know are good but
they're also new things that I hadn't
tried and it was nice to me to try it so
the new skin long-wear weightless
foundation SPF 15 I'm here for it this
was really really good it's a matte
finish it's a weight look I'm down I am
for this foundation for me the brow
product wasn't actually amazing the only
ones that I'd basically have a
non-existent brown so this was a no for
me but I came to my eyeshadow palette to
be honest it's kind of a little bit on
the like the classic side and but what I
will say the pigments are strong but the
shades in this palette were not great
for me but the individuals I think I'll
way better because you can find
individuals that you actually want but
the fact I could use the blush on my eye
I'm really happy that it's a full
coverage concealer you guys already know
I've talked about it too many times
I'm a fan the finishing powder was very
interesting sheer finishing powder hmm
not very sure actually quite medium
pigmented but I love I feel like it
brought everything back together so I'm
here for it highlighting powder just
just oh my gosh
it's just like dripping gold loving it
and then this lip gloss we were living
in 3,018 because it's very modern and I
feel like this look kind of embodies
that even though it's a full coverage
foundation and full coverage it up well
this could be my natural skin whoever
knows you don't even know well so guys
that is it for me that's a full face of
Bobbi Brown and as I mentioned I did
partner with them in like back in
October I shot an amazing piece of
content with them I haven't linked in
the description bar below so you can
check it out so yes I'm a fan of the
brand cuz I think they're phenomenal but
I always tried to keep my views as
impartial and as honest as possible so
guys thank you for watching and I'll see
you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
