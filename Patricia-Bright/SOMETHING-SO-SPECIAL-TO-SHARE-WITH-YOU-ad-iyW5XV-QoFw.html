viewing for something special and very
excited I'm going to take a seat on my
bed I've been wanting to show this of
you guys for such a long time I mean for
me this is so powerful because the whole
point of me doing videos is to be able
to provide a little bit of a escape even
if it's about fashion or it's about
beauty or about my life like it's
literally about providing escape and
some entertainment however what you
going to feel about an actual physical
escape oh yes
amazing now if you guys haven't seen
these bottles they are absolutely
everywhere these are on all different
coke bottles and what you'll see is that
there are destinations on the front of
these and this one says clothes for
moving
so basically coke are giving away a
holiday every single day and it's a four
star seven days for basically four
people the thing that I'm super excited
about right now but they have given me
an additional chance so you guys
watching this video to win a experience
to Koh Samui which is a destination that
I pee because it had a huge impact on my
life and I'm going to share with you my
travel story the thing about that when I
traveled some of my experiences just to
let you know that the level of impact is
actually had on my life and I feel like
this kind of shaped me to what I am
today and I feel like travel is so
important so I'm going to give you the
details of that in this video at the end
of the video but I want to share a
little bit as to why travel is so
important to me and also a bit about my
experiences because I know for some you
guys are you know world travelers and
some are not so yeah I'm going to give
you my little bit of a breakdown
okay so comfortable I've got a chair I'm
going to go ahead and share view a
little bit about my kind of travel story
and if you guys have been watching me
long enough you will actually remember
when baby Patricia went away with a
girlfriend of mine and we went to
Southeast Asia we were broke
just out of uni students and we decided
to do a kind of backpacking trip to
Southeast Asia we get some Malaysia
Singapore Bond in then every step of the
way
so let me learn a different thing and
met different people and I will say the
first thing that I remember when we were
planning to go away is I felt very
nervous because I hadn't been away like
with somewhere so far without that
family and we were friends but we
weren't like really really close friends
but what I loved about the garden when
we look who I wanted with how
adventurous she was and for me I was
like okay you know I want to be a bit
more like her I want to be adventurous I
want to be confident so you know what I
swear that we booked and cost that our
hostels our flights we did all of that I
think we did it for like two to three
weeks for probably about 600 pounds that
is how much we spend we were not going
to live luxury lifestyle this laminate
but we were excited and yet living our
life so the first thought was Malaysia
and we arrived in a hostel and I in my
mind has a thought of a hospital a being
like quite dingy kind of scary kind of
dangerous but actually it was amazing
it's really really nice it had a wooden
paneled with had wooden paneled walls
and we shared a bed we shared the
bathroom actually so it was really quite
nice and all I remember was just being
quite giddy like we just wanted to go
out we wanted to meet people and connect
with people who had never met and I feel
like when you travel that is exactly
what you do the ended up making friends
with lots of local lady boys who
absolutely loved us with at our first
drag show and I haven't ever seen a drag
show before I've never met a lady boy
before
however they were loving ask you like
the new best friend via to come with you
know a little bit so on another culture
they were so excited I remember dancing
on stage with Lady voice doing some kind
of randomness that I wouldn't normally
do because often when you're at home
you're very self-conscious but when you
go away you're like you know what nobody
knows me here I'm going to do something
and make new friends which is exactly
what we did when we went away and
whatever I was just experiencing local
food local culture and if you want to
learn how to boss are the best way to do
is obviously when you're abroad and we
did a lot of barking
we were able to get quite a lot of
discounts because people were very very
spending of us and also in the same
breath I also learned in Malaysia not to
lose your wits about you and I know some
of us can get a little bit carried away
we're in a holiday that's also important
to stay safe and I know I've shared you
know a bit of a horror story in the past
but you know I feel like I definitely
learned from that after that our next
thought was Singapore and I feel like
Singapore was my favorite favorite spot
for a number of reasons it kind of
taught me that well one the power of
YouTube I was most excited for was the
chance to actually meet up with a
subscriber Chinese Singaporean girl who
was watching little of me in London and
when I said I was coming to Southeast
Asia she's like if you come to Singapore
please come and meet me a which I did
and that is what I realized that there
are little things that can connect
people from around the world for
different reasons and YouTube was
basically that thing that connected
myself and Nicole we went to dinner
together we were shopping together it
was a really really nice it was
extremely random because this was before
the days of meetups over for the days of
you know being you know quite popular it
was just a case of random girls who
loved talking about fashion and drifting
on the internet actually connecting in
person and I found that very powerful I
love we met so many expats we ended up
popping with random people as you end up
doing go to lots of house parties you
know interacting with a lot of guys
that's really what you end up doing you
end up meeting a lot of guys as a girl
but in a in a good way because you know
one guy had the hots for my friends he
was a dairy farmer and I was just like
on the side just being the crazy guy
that I normally am and and it's so nice
just to be able to talk to people from
different walks of life but also where
you find people who are similar okay so
I lost that was barley and the thing I
picked up in barley is that you have to
try everything once and if you guys are
watching for long enough you'll know
that I'm a bit of a scaredy-cat however
I will just try stuff as much I think I
hate it I'll just try it at least to say
I've tried to do it and somehow we hit
the beach and ended up meeting some
locals too with giving surfing lessons
guys I can barely swim but I decided you
know what I'm going to suck yeah I'm
going to join the gang and I'm going to
surf and we spent hours just practising
surfing I was able to stand up like once
I was not good to hear anything my best
but ended up my surfing my friend was
amazing and just having a really good
time and I think it's so important just
to try something at least once and that
is what travel does to you kind of make
sure you push yourself out of your
comfort zone and Oh after that it was
amazing ended up meeting these other
guys who like stepping on the island for
like six months about what you guys
doing it for so long they were like
we're just here like live in their best
life and they like come around they had
bikes and they gave us basically our fav
sunrise tour of the island so it was
investing you know you ain't no you
aware you didn't sleep I think you're
like from like 2 o'clock to like 6 7
a.m. we were like cruising around the
island we'll go to lots of different
vintages and ended up on a private beach
and watching the sunrise and I don't
know where else you're going to get to
do that but there was an amazing place
to do it an experience that I will
forever remember in my mind based on
that experience going on a girly trip I
ended up going back there again because
I love Southeast Asia I feel like you
get a little bit of everything I mean
there's lots of places in the world like
absolutely love Southeast Asia's one of
my favourite and then I ended up going
to Thailand and I've been back twice now
so I'm clearly a huge bag I love the
food I love the culture and that is why
Koh Samui was a location that I really
wanted to pick for you guys to be able
to go to because I feel like it balances
the culture the beauty the food the
relaxation the luxury and now that you
know that I'm a bit older I've
advertised with this you know backpack
lifestyle makes maybe if I decide to go
on like other than have a midlife crisis
I decided to do some backpacking but
right now I like I like the good life I
wanted to share that with you guys as
well so I wanted to share with you a
little bit of insight into my travel
experiences and why I found it so
valuable to me and why I really really
want you guys to enter so the
