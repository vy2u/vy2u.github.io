channel I hope you are doing well I'm
excited as I always am because you knows
they like to say new year new me
honestly I did test that time I hate
when people say that however I'm not
gonna lie I definitely feel like I can
sit here and say that this year is about
to be amazing and there are so many
things that I feel like I learnt from
2017 so today we're just gonna speak on
those and I feel like I wanted to just
do something that's a little bit chatty
motivational as we come into the new
year because ladies and gentlemen this
year I mean I'm cleaning it for myself
is about to be my best year so far not
ever but so far because I am gonna learn
from the things that I experienced in my
past to make this year amazing I just
hope that this video is gonna give you
guys a little bit of you know feel-good
factor delivery kick up the backside
yeah maybe just put you guys in the
greatest mindset for the year to come
you know also this video is sponsored by
Google home Mini in particular so shout
out to Google let's get started so
number one I learned to stop worrying
what anybody else thought about me
because in reality someone's always
going to have something to say like
people will always have an opinion on
you the worry of what you think others
are going to think about you can
actually stop you and hold you back from
being your true true self and reaching
your purpose and I think you've got to
get to a place where you release the
chains or the burdens of what everybody
else thinks and you have to do you and I
mean I feel like you guys noticed it
last year I was just like I do not care
what people think about me like that
litters like I don't care and I might
not seem like a person whose
subconscious but I am I often the second
second guess myself mentally and like
emotionally but I love to be like no not
I'm not gonna take him against myself
I'm not gonna even think it I'm gonna do
what feels right to me and I don't care
what Tom Dick Mary Jo or Lucy have got
to say about it
hmm this is a good one I learnt that
time waits for no one and if you want to
be a boss you have to manage your time
like a boss I am a scheduling kind of
girl I used to write things in Diaries I
have Excel spreadsheets and that kind of
goal and I had to really learn how to
develop Nikki managing my life
hour-by-hour I absolutely love my Google
home Mini it's just amazing especially
for reading out my schedule so but I'm
like okay Google what's on my schedule
for today today there are three events
on your calendar the first starts at
5:15 p.m. the titleist reply to emails
the second is at 7:15 p.m. with a title
nail salon appointment the third one is
at 8:15 p.m. with a title gym session
with girls no excuses like honestly I
think that if you want to be great and
if you want to know your value you have
to learn how to manage your time cuz it
will run away with you and the more you
do and the more spot something that you
have especially me as a mom as a
businesswoman as a youtuber I don't have
time to waste
listen I learned to schedule every hour
of my day but it works so so well and
actually I feel like I have more time
because I manage my time all right this
one is that it's a little hush but
sometimes the truth hurts and delete and
block is kind of good for your soul and
I love this in 2017 I found that there's
certain negative energy negative people
negative situations that you really do
not need to see or have around to you
and I mean I learned a lot about
friendship in last year and there's
certain things that I was like wow and I
remember being you know maybe there are
people who hurt me your situations that
had hurt me and upset me but yeah I
could continue see these individuals or
these situations on my feet and I
remember being like you know what I
don't need this energy in my moment in
my present and in my here and now and so
I got very trigger-happy and I was like
you know what delete blocked delete
blocked delete block and then it's
almost like you realize wow that thing
that bothered me or that situation that
bothered me doesn't bother me anymore
and it was simply by using the delete
and block button so this one's really
good and I implore that you add this to
your like
lifestyle routine and basically it is if
you want to break a bad habit usually
you have to create a new one I decided
last year that I didn't I wanted to
manage and own the first hour in the
last hour of my day I learnt this form I
believe it's Jim quick he's amazing and
it's the whole idea of like you have a
certain number of decisions that you can
make in a day so if you are overwhelmed
from ditching them the beginning of the
day you've got all this information your
social media your emails your Twitter
all of this stuff right you it's already
blocking your mind or by 12 o'clock
you're not able to do anything so I just
try and take control of the look first
and last hour of the day so rather than
you know picking up my phone which is
what I dislike wake up check my phone my
phones my alarm and you know just I'm on
it
so I had to say no no more phones in my
room so I use my Google home Mini I use
that as my alarm clock it reads the news
I can find out the weather I can find
out what's going on for my schedule for
the day and it means that I have all of
that information to hand but not my
phone right so if I don't need to know
okay what have I got going on today I am
able to find out that information
without picking up my mobile phone and
then thinking I'm turning off my alarm
clock but really oughta matically on
Twitter I'm automatically on snapchat or
automatically on Instagram and it
literally became a reflex so my new
habit is not having my phone in my room
for the first hour and the last hour and
completely off lines so this one is
quite personal quite close to home and
it is to take care of your mental health
and I think last year was one of the
years where I feel like there was a nice
push towards understanding the
importance of mental health and I think
that not enough people were taking it as
seriously as they needed to and this
year that is a goal for me personally I
dealt with you know certain things that
were quite stressful we lost a young
family member to suicide last year and I
know I didn't talk about it because I
wanted to respect my family but that
that situation was very very real and I
think it was a revelation and after that
I really
to step back in realizing that you know
what mental well-being is so so
important and being able to talk to
someone is really really important and I
am I ask anyone if there's anything
you're gonna focus on focus on your
mental health because if you have peace
of mind have peace and body and you're
able to do what you need to do and there
are different charities such as mind or
the Samaritans out there if you are
dealing with situations that you can go
to and you can speak to them about what
you may be dealing with okay so this
this is powerful it is to keep on
learning and if you guys have follow me
on my snapchat you might notice that and
I mentioned about wanting to go back to
university right and I realize that
that's about this is my desire to keep
on learning it's so so so important to
learn because as you leave school and as
you leave the structure like a lot of
people think they've made it no you
haven't made it life is a lessening me
to keep learning and the best way to
learn is to ask questions ask questions
about anything and everything
okay Google how far is the Earth from
the Sun the Sun is one hundred and forty
nine point six million kilometres from
Earth you know what it doesn't matter
what questions you ask just asking
questions and learning something about
something is important you need to be
around people and situations that
sharpen you and ask questions that will
make you better you want to be great you
want to be big you need to learn from
those who are already doing that and ask
questions staying on the same line of
thought because you guys know this is
the stuff that makes them tick and it is
to read I am you know I'm a geek you
guys know I am a geek at heart
I love reading I love books I love
education I just like to know stuff and
I've realized that if you want to if you
want to do a certain path or you want to
achieve something the shortcut to
achieving that is by reading I'm trying
to start to read a book a week or even
read a book a month read something
there's certain things that I want to
achieve right but I'm impatient so I
want to learn the shortcuts by reading
other successful people how did they get
there I'm just going to read how they
got there and do
recreate that and do that myself I love
this one this is me I don't have any
difficulty with this I feel like I love
you guys notice that I became a little
bit more silly a little bit more fun and
this year and I genuinely think it's by
having a baby right I am a big kid
naturally and then I have a bit a little
kid in my house and I feel like it's
okay to be silly
shake it up listen my biggest Jam of
2017 was twinkle twinkle little star and
head shoulders knees and toes we spend a
lot of time together you know finding
out you know what sound does a cow make
here's a cow sound or barring like a
sheep or woofing like a dog and I'm
telling you like little things like that
have actually just made me feel more
free as a person because you know what
it's okay to be silly it's okay to be
fun it's okay to be joke jovial oh I
love this one I feel like I feel like
last year with the revelation of my real
friends and I feel like the one thing I
want to say is to appreciate your real
friends I am very comfortable and very
confident with the people who I have in
my life and the people who I want to
make time for and I definitely want to
make time for new people and stuff like
that but for me appreciating those that
have been for me here that came for me
my girls know who they are like I
literally love men oh this this one here
it's like this one this is a real lesson
yeah sometimes you've got to say no
today to say yes to your destiny
tomorrow and you know I'm still waiting
on this you know this you know can I get
an amen somewhere I'm still waiting on
this but there's certain things I kind
of got to this place of I you know
sometimes you're scared and you want to
do everything like yeah I can do that
yeah I can do that yeah I can do that
and then you actually end up sacrificing
yourself and you say yes to an
opportunity right now because it looks
great but something but in you something
in your psyches like um I don't know
I don't know sometimes you have to
listen to what you're saying and be like
no right now sacrifice that thing that
you're going to get instantly say no
right now
saying no right now maybe you say yes to
something bigger and better and more
suitable for you in the future sometimes
it might look like something's all great
but looking little closer it might not
be right for you so guys those are some
of the things that I learned in 2017 I
wanted to do something that was a little
bit more emotional and a bit more you
know motivational I thought it's really
important to just get your head right as
you come into a new year and I feel like
you know 2017 was a big year but this is
about to be bigger for me and also for
you so thank you so much for watching
