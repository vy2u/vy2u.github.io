quite a long time and I've always felt
like I've been able to share you know
what I'm going through how I feel with
you guys and I really feel like now is
the time to basically tell you something
I wanted to say this for a long time but
I just haven't had the chance to so
things are changing around here guys and
it's about to be right must good I have
a bad way if I had you guys work
yeah I'm sorry guys I'm really sorry if
I have just made you guys for really
nervous and they know something wrong
there wasn't anything wrong it's about
to be brightness around here and the
reason why I feel like I need to make an
announcement is because I've never
actually done it I've been on YouTube
for 7.7 years I really wanted to do it
because this is the year that marks
hopefully my million subscribers and I
want to do something really really
special that I remember this December as
the month or something special so I want
to do a major giveaway I'm going to be
giving away not one but two MacBook and
I'm also going to be giving away two
iPhone 7 and in every video I'm going to
have some major Beauty goodies that I
want to give to you guys all you need to
do is be subscribed to this channel

Instagram and on my Twitter and that is
basically it a December 30th I will
announce to all my winners and
everything are but I'm really really
excited for this time of year and I feel
like I come to a place where I'm really
comfortable in who I am and what I want
to be in this world and I feel in this
world but it missed like this ug1 and I
feel like there's a space for everyone
in in what they do and like you know I'm
slightly a beauty guru I'm slightly an
auntie I'm slightly a mother and I'm
slightly of why I'm slightly a bit of
everything and I kind of tried to come
to terms of like trying to be one thing
but I'm not one or the other and I like
being a bit of everything and I feel
like there's girls and women out there
who feel that way so I hope that what
I'm going to do over the next month I'm
going to be having four videos a week

be having a vlog once a week I cannot do
everyday vlog I'm not about that life I
can't even blog on my main vlog channel
