video is going to be on how always I
wear white t-shirts and my last how I
where video you guys definitely said
white t-shirt or t-shirts quite a few
times so I thought yeah this is
definitely something I want to do and I
had the stuff in my wardrobe I was like
yeah I'm gonna do this video for you
guys and I definitely think a white
t-shirt is really really versatile towel
I actually wear them to work like it's
that let's start basically anyway I'm
going to stop blabbering and let you
enjoy the video I was going to say that
I've got my facebook links below my
twitter link so do join me over there
and where you get to see more pictures
for me and anyway I'll see you later bye
guys so guys this is my white t-shirt
it's kind of a round neck and it does
have a little pocket to add a bit of
flavor to it so I like wearing a white t
even potentially a squirt like a kind of
a line skirt or something really pretty
just for really summery and flirty look
mine's a little high on the waist you
don't need to wear it that way paired
with some cute heels it can look really
feminine and girly so my next wave ring
white tea is hanging loose with a pair
of leggings really simple really casual
add some boots and some flavor and it's
perfect
if you are gonna wear it with leggings
and I always try to cover my rear end so
you can see it's really casual look just
add some accessories anyhow and also
being the fact that it's freezing cold
in England a long cardi always goes
really well with this look so I always
feel like american apparel items are
absolutely perfect but any kind of
high-waisted jeans a little bit of shine
will look lovely with a white t-shirt
and i've added like just a bit of scarf
accessory to add a bit of flavor to the
outfit if you do want a tutorial on this
then leave a comment below and I'll show
you how I do it it's really easy I think
this next look just shows how you can
wear a white tee to an event or
something a bit more small it doesn't
have to be casual just pair it with a
blazer some statement trousers and some
heels and I think it's absolutely
perfect
shockingly I could actually wear a
t-shirt to work I look a bit back a
newsreader right now but I do work in a
professional environment but with a
pencil skirt and a blazer I absolutely
love the way a white t-shirt looks so
guys the perfect way really casual with
a pair of shorts a white t-shirt looks
amazing you can go for jean shorts but
here I'm wearing tailored shorts and I
don't know it just looks so elegant and
laid back so yeah my favorite look so
guys this is the most classic and
easiest way to wear white t-shirt a pair
of jeans and a leather jacket it's just
so effortless and seamless and I love it
ok guys thanks so much for watching do
you leave a comment below and let me
know what what to wear you'd like to see
