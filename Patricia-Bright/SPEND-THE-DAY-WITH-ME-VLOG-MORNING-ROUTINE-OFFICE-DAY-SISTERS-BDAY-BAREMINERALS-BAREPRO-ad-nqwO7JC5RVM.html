right tell me hey guys welcome to my
channel I hope you guys are doing well
today's we do a little bit different
because I thought it would be there's
there's the dishwasher yeah I thought it
would be nice for me to basically do a
spin the day with me to give you guys an
idea of what I do in an entire day but
more like in a long style which I hope
you guys don't mind so much but it's
also one of the hottest days of the
years and my sister's birthday so I
thought today is going to be like a
little bit of a fun a day so I was like
okay I'm going to vlog so the first
thing I normally do is tend to grow you
can bobby here here they're just gonna
wash your bottles and give her a fee and
then i am going to make some teas near
my call so what's the second morning as
well good morning we try to have a
little bit of morning time together
because obviously I don't see Michael
for the entire day and I won't actually
see you till on tonight crisis to me the
hair and then is there all places oh but
I store them all for me basically if it
goes like that one it's so strange you
like opens her mouth
so if I had my own way I will probably
play a grace all day but that's not real
life is it darling we saved up for
Friday to Sunday and so I'm going to get
her ready and the Martha's gonna make my
stomach breakfast
she said up to get ready today aren't
you darling you're always pretty you're
always pretty
all right you're ready now mommy's gotta
go get ready all right so just had a
shower and stuff guys I'm not gonna lie
I don't usually have a lot of time in
the morning and when I do videos but we
said put my old glamour and I'd rather
set up but a day-to-day basis is it's
not necessarily possible but today it's
going to be one of those days because it
is my sister's birthday so I'm going to
kind of just show you as I get ready and
obviously you guys see my video set up
but that's not what I do on a regular
basis and I think I've showed you guys
this before this is my like posture and
everything this thing here
bring ahead with my bare minerals
concealer and the color I'm using is the
deep to dark
alright guys so I know I look strange
right about now my makeup isn't entirely
finished but I'm going to show you a new
foundation I'm using I'm using the new
bare Pro Foundation from bare minerals
and if you know much about them they
really like to use ingredients that
support a healthy complexion so 90%
vitamins and minerals and this is a new
powder foundation and I'm not going to
lie to you I don't normally wear powder
foundation if anything I've always kind
of run away from them because I feel
that they can look a little bit cakey
sometimes but this is the new bare Pro
Foundation which is meant to give you 12
hours glam coverage but without the
cakiness
so the whole concept is basically free
the face I'm going to go ahead and use
this or a great thickness oils that
there's lots of different shades there's
20 different shades the color I'm
wearing right now is hazelnut 25 and
this is actually the core coverage brush
that you use to apply the powder to give
you a lighter coverage and just kind of
buff it all in as you just switched it
out to the chai 26 I think that was a
little bit warmer on my skin tone it
really does give you quite a matte
finish but it doesn't feel cakey at all
if they've got the darker colors that
are amazing but I'm going to use these
for my contour and this as contour is
amazing really really good so I couldn't
talk while I was doing the rest of this
part but I did my face as per usual I
did a little bit of color on my lid and
added some chocolate well this is quite
glam for me I don't do this every day
but as it's a special day I thought it
would be nice to just beat my entire
face but normally I would keep it a lot
lighter on my next I went for this matte
product by actually ended up putting
gloss on in the end because it looked a
bit dry
okay guys that is my glam face done for
the day
yes it's far too early in the morning to
be looking like this but it's alright
it's okay the foundation doesn't look
cakey it does look different to my
normal but I did like it I think it's
really nice and I'm loving their contour
color as well alright guys I put my
outfit this is what I'm wearing today
it's such a nice and a hot day I was
like a good always a big night out this
