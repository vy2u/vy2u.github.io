have a whole video for you is that she
just well not just the promo code but
it's a Primark haul because I got went
there and I've got a few different
things recently so let me just show the
first I got was these pair of like
floral floral not green pants but just
these really floral hippy pants that so
I'm gonna bring them a slouch pant
they're really cute and I've got a
really cute pattern on them they're a
bit strange but I think they're quite
cool
they're quite cool I can imagine me
wearing these on holiday in in Bali it
imagine me doing that I'm gonna keep
going on about my holiday because I've
not been away in a year so I need a
holiday so yeah those are these pants
and they're really a bargain they're
absolute bargain that Primark has going
on
are these dresses Primark has these
amazing little dresses buttons going
down them that polka dot dresses and
they're going for 5 pounds they are 5
pounds but the reason being that they're
go for eyebrows because this made of the
worst fabric in the world but did you
know what the fabrics not too bad but
this is what they use this is the fabric
that they use to make patterns and then
when they make clothes this is the stuff
that they throw away like no problem I
can make a dresses out of it so yeah
that's lovely stress that I picked up
the first person who I saw when it was
dolly Bobo she's got a really cute cute
amazing channel and I saw this dress on
her Channel and I said oh my gosh I've
got to get that it's this white dress
here with its gold buttons and it's
see-through it was 13 pounds but once
again it's not made out of the best
fabric in the world but that's prime up
for you
it's really cute that you can imagine
that on the next thing that I got and my
most favourite thing that I got is this
amazing blazer ok I picked up this
blazer and since I picked it up I've not
put it down look at the lining let me
show you it on
this is what this place that looks like
on it's a gorgeous color look at the
design and the detail on it the navy
it's just really really preppy and stuff
like that so I love the way this looks
and the pockets as well there was
actually like some brooch band thing on
there but I was like no that's gross
that's ugly and I just took it off which
is just another great way you can like
cause I also got um this I'll show you
this it's like so these are like some
vintage trousers but this top is like a
polka dot round neck top and that's what
this is what the back looks like and
it's really really cute and it's
actually a bodysuit so it's like going
all the way around like a swimming
costume type so I don't know what they
call those things but I loved I loved
the low neck and I loved the fact that
the back of it was really low as well
and it's polka dot so god this stress
which is the almost the exact same style
as the white one but it's in the floral
and it's a really pretty floral pattern
and I really wanted some floors for um
this this spring I've got a floral
videos coming up maybe if you would like
to see it then saying you wanna see I've
also got this skirt this cuts really
different for me it's quite loud but I
love the pattern you can see the pattern
and the design it's just so cute you
could see what that would kind of look
like I bought that as well and I think
that was ten pint of these shoes right
and these are what they called again I
can't remember they're called but I
remember I had a friend who used to wear
shoes like this and I used to hate that
my sweat why'd you wear these shoes with
the tassels they're so gratified but no
no no she was just way ahead of her
fashion game when she's like 12 years
old 13 when we were young but yeah I
love these tassel shoes I also bought
these peep toe peep toe ankle boots but
I don't think I like them because
there's too much toe action going on too
much toe so I'll probably return them
this gorgeous gorgeous hair band and I
thought this is really cute for like
spring/summer something that is just
really cute and really pretty and just I
don't know you're just very girly and
feminine and finally I picked up this
bag I've seen so many people with this
bag is literally unbelievable I'm not
sure if I want it anymore I'm probably
gonna go and get another bad because
it's just too common it's just too
common but it is gorgeous it is gorgeous
I didn't know there's only seven quid as
well so you might as well get it so guys
that is the end of my haul video
is anything else that you want to see
let me know any video ideas I don't know
I'm getting a bit dry ideas are running
out
do you like the videos I do we're kind
of talking and stuff but let me know and
my boyfriend won't be coming back as I
said you guys will see him very shortly
okay guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
